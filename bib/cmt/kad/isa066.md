### [Isaiah Chapter 66](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 66:1</span></span>

Although the note on which this prophecy opens is a different one from
any that has yet been struck, there are many points in which it
coincides with the preceding prophecy. For not only is [Isa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012.md) repeated here in [Isa
66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004.md), but the sharp line of
demarcation drawn in chapter 65, between the servants of Jehovah and the
worldly majority of the nation with reference to the approaching return
to the Holy Land, is continued here. As the idea of their return is
associated immediately with that of the erection of a new temple, there
is nothing at all to surprise us, after what we have read in [Isa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008.md)., in the fact that Jehovah
expresses His abhorrence at the thought of having a temple built by the
Israel of the captivity, as the majority then were, and does so in such
words as those which follow in [Isa
66:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md) : "Thus saith Jehovah: The
heaven is my throne, and the earth my footstool. What kind of house is
it that ye would build me, and what kind of place for my rest? My hand
hath made all these things; then all these thing arose, saith Jehovah;
and at such persons do I look, at the miserable and broken-hearted, and
him that trembleth at my word. He that slaughtereth the ox is the slayer
of a man; he that sacrificeth the sheep is a strangler of dogs; he that
offereth a meat-offering, it is swine's blood; he that causeth incense
to rise up in smoke, blesseth idols. As they have chosen their ways, and
their soul cheriseth pleasure in their abominations; so will I choose
their ill-treatments, and bring their terrors upon them, because I
called and no one replied, I spake and they did not hear, and they did
evil in mine eyes, and chose that in which I took no pleasure." Hitzig
is of opinion that the author has broken off here, and proceeds quite
unexpectedly to denounce the intention to build a temple for Jehovah.
Those who wish to build he imagines to be those who have made up their
minds to stay behind in Chaldea, and who, whilst their brethren who have
returned to their native land are preparing to build a temple there,
want to have one of their own, just as the Jews in Egypt built one for
themselves in Leontopolis. Without some such supposition as this, Hitzig
thinks it altogether impossible to discover the thread which connects
the different vv. together. This view is at any rate better than that of
Umbreit, who imagines that the prophet places us here "on the loftiest
spiritual height of the Christian development." "In the new Jerusalem,"
he says, "there will be no temple seen, nor any sacrifice; Jehovah
forbids these in the strongest terms, regarding them as equivalent to
mortal sins." But the prophet, if this were his meaning, would involve
himself in self-contradiction, inasmuch as, according to [Isa
56:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md) and 60, there will be a temple
in the new Jerusalem with perpetual sacrifice, which this prophecy also
presupposes in [Isa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md). (cf., [Isa
66:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#006).md); and secondly, he would
contradict other prophets, such as Ezekiel and Zechariah, and the spirit
of the Old Testament generally, in which the statement, that whoever
slaughters a sacrificial animal in the new Jerusalem will be as bad as a
murderer, has no parallel, and is in fact absolutely impossible.
According to Hitzig's view, on the other hand, v. 3a affirms, that the
worship which they would be bound to perform in their projected temple
would be an abomination to Jehovah, however thoroughly it might be made
to conform to the Mosaic ritual. But there is nothing in the text to
sustain the idea, that there is any intention here to condemn the
building of a temple to Jehovah in Chaldaea, nor is such an explanation
by any means necessary to make the text clear. The condemnation on the
part of Jehovah has reference to the temple, which the returning exiles
intend to build in Jerusalem. The prophecy is addressed to the entire
body now ready to return, and says to the whole without exception, that
Jehovah, the Creator of heaven and earth, does not stand in need of any
house erected by human hands, and then proceeds to separate the penitent
from those that are at enmity against God, rejects in the most scornful
manner all offerings in the form of worship on the part of the latter,
and threatens them with divine retribution, having dropped in [Isa
66:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md) the form of address to the
entire body. Just as in the Psalm of Asaph (Ps 50) Jehovah refuses
animal and other material offerings as such, because the whole of the
animal world, the earth and the fulness thereof, are His possession, so
here He addresses this question to the entire body of the exiles: What
kind of house is there that ye could build, that would be worthy of me,
and what kind of place that would be worthy of being assigned to me as a
resting-place? On mâqōm menūchâthı̄, locus qui sit requies mea
(apposition instead of genitive connection). He needs no temple; for
heaven is His throne, and the earth His footstool. He is the Being who
filleth all, the Creator, and therefore the possessor, of the universe;
and if men think to do Him a service by building Him a temple, and
forget His infinite majesty in their concern for their own contemptible
fabric, He wants to temple at all. "All these" refer, as if pointing
with the finger, to the world of visible objects that surround us.
ויּהיוּ (from היה, existere, fieri) is used in the same sense as the
ויהי which followed the creative יהי. In this His exaltation He is not
concerned about a temple; but His gracious look is fixed upon the man
who is as follows (zeh pointing forwards as in [Isa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006).md), viz., upon the mourner, the man
of broken heart, who is filled with reverential awe at the word of His
revelation.

We may see from [Psa 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#009.md) what the
link of connection is between [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md) and [Isa
66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md). So far as the mass of the exiles
were concerned, who had not been humbled by their sufferings, and whom
the preaching of the prophet could not bring to reflection, He did not
want any temple or sacrifice from them. The sacrificial acts, to which
such detestable predicates are here applied, are such as end with the
merely external act, whilst the inward feelings of the person presenting
the sacrifice are altogether opposed to the idea of both the animal
sacrifice and the meat-offering, more especially to that desire for
salvation which was symbolized in all the sacrifices; in other words,
they are sacrificial acts regarded as νεκρὰ ἔργα, the lifeless works of
men spiritually dead. The articles of hasshōr and hasseh are used as
generic with reference to sacrificial animals. The slaughter of an ox
was like the slaying (makkēh construct with tzere) of a man (for the
association of ideas, see [Gen 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006).md);
the sacrifice (zōbhēăch like shâchat is sometimes applied to
slaughtering for the purpose of eating; here, however, it refers to an
animal prepared for Jehovah) of a sheep like the strangling of a dog,
that unclean animal (for the association of ideas, see [Job
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001)); the offerer up (me‛ōlēh.md) of a
meat-offering (like one who offered up) swine's blood, i.e., as if he
was offering up the blood of this most unclean animal upon the altar; he
who offered incense as an 'azkârâh (see at [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013).md) like one who blessed 'âven,
i.e., godlessness, used here as in [Sa1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md), and also in Hosea in the change
of the name of Bethel into Beth 'Aven, for idolatry, or rather in a
concrete sense for the worthless idols themselves, all of which,
according to [Isa 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029.md), are nothing
but 'âven. Rosenmller, Gesenius, Hitzig, Stier, and even Jerome, have
all correctly rendered it in this way, "as if he blessed an idol" (quasi
qui benedicat idolo); and Vitringa, "cultum exhibens vano numini"
(offering worship to a vain god). Such explanations as that of Luther,
on the other hand, viz., "as if he praised that which was wrong," are
opposed to the antithesis, and also to the presumption of a concrete
object to מברך (blessing); whilst that of Knobel, "praising vainly"
('âven being taken as an acc. Adv.), yields too tame an antithesis, and
is at variance with the usage of the language. In this condemnation of
the ritual acts of worship, the closing prophecy of the book of Isaiah
coincides with the first ([Isa
1:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011).md). But that it is not
sacrifices in themselves that are rejected, but the sacrifices of those
whose hearts are divided between Jehovah and idols, and who refuse to
offer to Him the sacrifice that is dearest to Him ([Psa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019.md), cf., [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023).md), is evident from the
correlative double-sentence that follows in [Isa
66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md) and [Isa
66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004.md), which is divided into two
masoretic verses, as the only means of securing symmetry. Gam ... gam,
which means in other cases, "both ... and also," or in negative
sentences "neither ... nor," means here, as in [Jer
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#012.md), "as assuredly the one as the
other," in other words, "as ... so." They have chosen their own ways,
which are far away from those of Jehovah, and their soul has taken
pleasure, not in the worship of Jehovah, but in all kinds of heathen
abominations (shiqqūtsēhem, as in many other places, after [Deu
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#016).md); therefore Jehovah wants no
temple built by them or with their co-operation, nor any restoration of
sacrificial worship at their hands. But according to the law of
retribution, He chooses tha‛ălūlēhem, vexationes eorum (lxx τὰ
ἐμπαίγματα αὐτῶν: see at [Isa 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#004).md),
with the suffix of the object: fates that will use them ill, and brings
their terrors upon them, i.e., such a condition of life as will inspire
them with terror (megūrōth, as in [Psa
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 66:5</span></span>

From the heathenish majority, with their ungodly hearts, the prophet now
turns to the minority, consisting of those who tremble with reverential
awe when they hear the word of God. They are called to hear how Jehovah
will accept them in defiance of their persecutors. "Hear ye the word of
Jehovah, ye that tremble at His word: your brethren that hate you, that
thrust you from them for my name's sake, say, 'Let Jehovah get honour,
that we may see your joy:' they will be put to shame." They that hate
them are their own brethren, and (what makes the sin still greater) the
name of Jehovah is the reason why they are hated by them. According to
the accents, indeed (מנדיכם rebia, סמי pashta), the meaning would be,
"your brethren say ... 'for my name's sake (i.e., for me = out of
goodness and love to us) will Jehovah glorify Himself,' - then we shall
see your joy, but - they will be put to shame." Rashi and other Jewish
expositors interpret it in this or some similar way; but Rosenmller,
Stier, and Hahn are the only modern Christian expositors, who have done
so, following the precedent of earlier commentators, who regarded the
accents as binding. Luther, however, very properly disregarded them. If
סמי למען be taken in connection with יכבד, it gives only a forced sense,
which disturbs the relation of all the clauses; whereas this is
preserved in all respects in the most natural and connected manner if we
combine שמי למען with מנדּיכם שׂנאיכם, as we must do, according to such
parallels as [Mat 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#009.md). נדּה from נר,
to scare away or thrust away ([Amo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003), with the object in the dative.md),
corresponds to ἀφορίζειν in [Luk 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022.md)
(compare [Joh 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md), "to put out of
the synagogue"). The practice of excommunication, or putting under the
ban (niddūi), reaches beyond the period of the Herodians (see Eduyoth v.
6),

(Note: Compare Wiesner: Der Bann in seiner gesch. Entwickelung auf dem
Boden des Judenthums, 1864.)

at any rate as far back as the times succeeding the captivity; but in
the passage before us it is quite sufficient to understand niddâh in the
sense of a defamatory renunciation of fellowship. To the accentuators
this שמי למען מנדיכם appeared quite unintelligible. They never
considered that it had a confessional sense here, which certainly does
not occur anywhere else: viz., "for my name's sake, which ye confess in
word and deed." With unbelieving scorn they say to those who confess
Jehovah, and believe in the word of the true redemption: Let Jehovah
glorify Himself (lit. let Him be, i.e., show Himself, glorious =
yikkâbēd, cf., [Job 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#021).md), that we
may thoroughly satisfy ourselves with looking at your joy. They regard
their hope as deceptive, and the word of the prophet as fanaticism.
These are they, who, when permission to return is suddenly given, will
desire to accompany them, but will be disappointed, because they did not
rejoice in faith before, and because, although they do now rejoice in
that which is self-evident, they do this in a wrong way.

[Isaiah 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 66:6</span></span>

The city and temple, to which they desire to go, are nothing more, so
far as they are concerned, than the places from which just judgment will
issue. "Sound of tumult from the city! Sound from the Temple! Sound of
Jehovah, who repays His enemies with punishment." All three קול, to the
second of which שׁאון must be supplied in thought, are in the form of
interjectional exclamations (as in [Isa
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008).md). In the third, however, we have
omitted the note of admiration, because here the interjectional clause
approximates very nearly to a substantive clause ("it is the sound of
Jehovah"), as the person shouting announces here who is the originator
and cause of the noise which was so enigmatical at first. The city and
temple are indeed still lying in ruins as the prophet is speaking; but
even in this state they both preserve the holiness conferred upon them.
They are the places where Jehovah will take up His abode once more; and
even now, at the point at which promise and fulfilment coincide, they
are in the very process of rising again. A loud noise (like the tumult
of war) proceeds from it. It is Jehovah, He who is enthroned in Zion and
rules from thence ([Isa 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009).md), who
makes Himself heard in this loud noise (compare [Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016.md) with the derivative passage in
[Amo 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002).md); it is He who awards
punishment or reckons retribution to His foes. In other cases גּמוּל
(השׁהיב) שׁלּם generally means to repay that which has been worked out
(what has been deserved; e.g., [Psa
137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008.md), compare [Isa
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#011).md); but in [Isa
59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md) gemūl was the parallel word to
chēmâh, and therefore, as in [Isa
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004.md), it did not apply to the works of
men, but to the retribution of the judge, just as in [Jer
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#006.md), where it is used quite as
absolutely. We have therefore rendered it "punishment;" "merited
punishment" would express both sides of this double-sided word. By "His
enemies," according to the context, we are to understand primarily the
mass of the exiles, who were so estranged from God, and yet withal so
full of demands and expectations.

[Isaiah 66:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 66:7</span></span>

All of these fall victims to the judgment; and yet Zion is not left
either childless or without population. "Before she travailed she
brought forth; before pains came upon her, she was delivered of a boy.
Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen anything like it? Are men
delivered of a land in one day? or is a nation begotten at once? For
Zion hath travailed, yea, hath brought forth her children. Should I
bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah: or
should I, who cause to bring forth, shut it? saith thy God." Before Zion
travaileth, before any labour pains come upon her (chēbhel with tzere),
she has already given birth, or brought with ease into the world a male
child (hı̄mlit like millēt, in [Isa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015), to cause to glide out.md). This
boy, of whom she is delivered with such marvellous rapidity, is a whole
land full of men, an entire nation. The seer exclaims with amazement,
like Zion herself in [Isa 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021.md), "who
hath heard such a thing, or seen anything like it? is a land brought to
the birth (hăyūchal followed by 'erets for hăthūchal, as in [Gen
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#006.md); [Isa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018); Ges. 147.md), i.e., the population
of a whole land (as in [Jdg 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030).md),
and that in one day, or a nation born all at once (yivvâlēd, with munach
attached to the kametz, and metheg to the tzere)? This unheard-of event
has taken place now, for Zion has travailed, yea, has also brought forth
her children," - not one child, but her children, a whole people that
calls her mother.

(Note: There is a certain similarity in the saying, with which a
talmudic teacher roused up the sleepy scholars of the Beth ha-Midrash:
"There was once a woman, who was delivered of 600,000 children in one
day," viz., Jochebed, who, when she gave birth to Moses, brought 600,000
to the light of freedom ([Exo 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037))..md)

"For" (kı̄) presupposes the suppressed thought, that this unexampled
event has now occurred: yâledâh follows châlâh with gam, because chı̄l
signifies strictly parturire; yâl, parere. Zion, the mother, is no other
than the woman of the sun in Rev 12; but the child born of her there is
the shepherd of the nations, who proceeds from her at the end of the
days, whereas here it is the new Israel of the last days; for the
church, which is saved through all her tribulations, is both the mother
of the Lord, by whom Babel is overthrown, and the mother of that Israel
which inherits the promises, that the unbelieving mass have failed to
obtain. [Isa 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#009.md) follows with an
emphatic confirmation of the things promised. Jehovah inquires: "Should
I create the delivery (cause the child to break through the matrix) and
not the birth (both hiphil, causative), so that although the child makes
an effort to pass the opening of the womb, it never comes to the light
of day? Or should I be one to bring it to the birth, and then to have
closed, viz., the womb, so that the word of bringing forth should remain
ineffectual, when all that is required is the last effort to bring to
the light the fruit of the womb?" From the expression "thy God," we see
that the questions are addressed to Zion, whose faith they are intended
to strengthen. According to Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, ii. 1, 149, 150),
the future יאמר affirms what Jehovah will say, when the time for
bringing forth arrives, and the perfect אמר what He is saying now:
"Should I who create the bringing forth have shut up?" And He comforts
the now barren daughter Zion ([Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001).md) with the assurance, that her
barrenness is not meant to continue for ever. "The prediction," says
Hofmann, "which is contained in ה יאמר, of the ultimate issue of the
fate of Zion, is so far connected with the consolation administered for
the time present, that she who is barren now is exhorted to anticipate
the time when the former promise shall be fulfilled." But this change in
the standpoint is artificial, and contrary to the general use of the
expression ה יאמר elsewhere (see at [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001).md). Moreover, the meaning of the
two clauses, which constitute here as elsewhere a disjunctive double
question in form more than in sense, really runs into one. The first
member affirms that Jehovah will complete the bringing to the birth; the
second, that He will not ultimately frustrate what He has almost brought
to completion: an ego sum is qui parere faciat et (uterum) occluserim
(occludam)? There is no other difference between יאמר and אמר, than that
the former signifies the word of God which is sounding at the present
moment, the latter the word that has been uttered and is resounding
still. The prophetic announcement of our prophet has advanced so far,
that the promised future is before the door. The church of the future is
already like the fruit of the body ripe for the birth, and about to
separate itself from the womb of Zion, which has been barren until now.
The God by whom everything has been already so far prepared, will
suddenly cause Zion to become a mother - a boy, viz., a whole people
after Jehovah's own heart, will suddenly lie in her lap, and this
new-born Israel, not the corrupt mass, will build a temple for Jehovah.

[Isaiah 66:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 66:10</span></span>

In the anticipation of such a future, those who inwardly participate in
the present sufferings of Zion are to rejoice beforehand in the change
of all their suffering into glory. "Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and exult
over her, all ye that love her; be ye delightfully glad with her, all ye
that mourn over her, that he may suck and be satisfied with the breast
of her consolations, that ye may sip and delight yourselves in the
abundance of her glory." Those who love Jerusalem (the abode of the
church, and the church itself), who mourn over her (hith'abbēl, inwardly
mourn, [Sa1 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035.md), prove and show
themselves to be mourners and go into mourning, b. Mod katan 20b, the
word generally used in prose, whereas אבל, to be thrown into mourning,
to mourn, only occurs in the higher style; compare ציּון אבלי, [Isa
57:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018.md); [Isa
61:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md); [Isa
60:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#020).md), these are even now to rejoice
in spirit with Jerusalem and exult on her account (bâh), and share her
ecstatic delight with her ('ittâh), in order that when that in which
they now rejoice in spirit shall be fulfilled, they may suck and be
satisfied, etc. Jerusalem is regarded as a mother, and the rich actual
consolation, which she receives ([Isa
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003).md), as the milk that enters her
breasts (shōd as in [Isa 60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016).md), and
from which she now supplies her children with plentiful nourishment.
זיז, which is parallel to שׁד (not זיו, a reading which none of the
ancients adopted), signifies a moving, shaking abundance, which
oscillates to and fro like a great mass of water, from זאזא, to move by
fits and starts, for pellere movere is the radical meaning common in
such combinations of letters as זא, זע, רא, [Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md), to which Bernstein and Knobel
have correctly traced the word; whereas the meaning emicans fluxus
(Schrder), or radians copia (Kocher), to pour out in the form of rays,
has nothing to sustain it in the usage of the language.

[Isaiah 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 66:12</span></span>

The reason is now given, why the church of the future promises such
abundant enjoyment to those who have suffered with her. "For thus saith
Jehovah, Behold, I guide peace to her like a river, and the glory of the
Gentiles like an overflowing stream, that ye may suck; ye shall be borne
upon arms, and fondled upon knees." Jehovah guides or turns ([Gen
39:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#021).md) peace to Jerusalem, the
greatest of all inward blessings, and at the same time the most glorious
of all the outward blessings, that are in the possession of the Gentile
world (kâbhōd as in [Isa 56:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#006).md), both
of them in the richest superabundance ("like a river," as in [Isa
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018)), so that (perf. cons..md) "ye may
be able to suck yourselves full according to your heart's desire" ([Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016).md). The figure of the new
maternity of Zion, and of her children as quasimodogeniti, is still
preserved. The members of the church can then revel in peace and wealth,
like a child at its mother's breasts. The world is now altogether in the
possession of the church, because the church is altogether God's. The
allusion to the heathen leads on to the thought, which was already
expressed in a similar manner in [Isa
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022.md) and [Isa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004) : "on the side (arm or shoulder.md)
will ye be carried, and fondled (שׁעשׁע, pulpal of the pilpel שׁעשׁע,
[Isa 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008).md) upon the knees," viz., by
the heathen, who will vie with one another in the effort to show you
tenderness and care ([Isa 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023).md).

[Isaiah 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 66:13</span></span>

The prophet now looks upon the members of the church as having grown up,
as it were, from childhood to maturity: they suck like a child, and are
comforted like a grown-up son. "Like a man whom his mother comforteth,
so will I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem." Hitzig
says that 'ı̄sh is not well chosen; but how easily could the prophet have
written bēn (son), as in [Isa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015.md)!
He writes 'ı̄sh, however, not indeed in the unmeaning sense in which the
lxx has taken it, viz., ὡς εἴ τινα μήτηρ παρακαλέσει, but looking upon
the people, whom he had previously thought of as children, as standing
before him as one man. Israel is now like a man who has escaped from
bondage and returned home from a foreign land, full of mournful
recollections, the echoing sounds of which entirely disappear in the
maternal arms of divine love there in Jerusalem, the beloved home, which
was the home of its thoughts even in the strange land.

[Isaiah 66:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 66:14</span></span>

Wherever they look, joy now meets their eye. "And ye will see, and your
heart will be joyful, and your bones will flourish like young herbage;
and thus does the hand of Jehovah make itself known in His servants, and
fiercely does He treat His enemies." They will see, and their heart will
rejoice, i.e., (cf., [Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md); [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005).md) they will enjoy a heart-cheering
prospect, and revive again with such smiling scenery all around. The
body is like a tree The bones are its branches. These will move and
extend themselves in the fulness of rejuvenated strength (compare [Isa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011), et ossa tua expedita faciet.md);
and thus will the hand of Jehovah practically become known (venwde‛âh,
perf. cons.) in His servants - that hand under whose gracious touch all
vernal life awakens, whether in body or in mind. And thus is it with the
surviving remnant of Israel, whereas Jehovah is fiercely angry with His
foes. The first את is used in a prepositional sense, as in [Psa
67:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#002.md), viz., "in His servants, so that
they come to be acquainted with it"; the second in an accusative sense,
for zâ'am is either connected with על, or as in [Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md); [Mal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#004.md), with the accusative of the
object. It is quite contrary to the usage of the language to take both
את according to the phrase (עס) את (רעה) מובה עשׂה.

[Isaiah 66:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 66:15</span></span>

The prophecy now takes a new turn with the thought expressed in the
words, "and fiercely does He treat His enemies." The judgment of wrath,
which prepares the way for the redemption and ensures its continuance,
is described more minutely in [Isa
66:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015.md) : "For behold Jehovah, in the
fire will He come, and His chariots are like the whirlwind, to pay out
His wrath in burning heat, and His threatening passeth into flames of
fire." Jehovah comes bâ'ēsh, in igne (Jerome; the lxx, on the contrary,
render it arbitrarily ὡς πῦρ kâ'ēsh), since it is the fiery side of His
glory, in which He appears, and fire pours from Him, which is primarily
the intense excitement of the powers of destruction within God Himself
([Isa 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017.md); [Isa
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md); [Psa
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009).md), and in these is transformed
into cosmical powers of destruction ([Isa
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md); [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md); [Psa
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013).md). He is compared to a warrior,
driving along upon war-chariots resembling stormy wind, which force
everything out of their way, and crush to pieces whatever comes under
their wheels. The plural מרכּבתיו (His chariots) is probably not merely
amplifying, but a strict plural; for Jehovah, the One, can manifest
Himself in love or wrath in different places at the same time. The very
same substantive clause מרכבתיו וכסופה occurs in [Jer
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013.md), where it is not used of Jehovah,
however, but of the Chaldeans. Observe also that Jeremiah there proceeds
immediately with a derivative passage from [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md). In the following clause denoting
the object, אפּו בּחמה להשׁיב, we must not adopt the rendering, "to
breathe out His wrath in burning heat" (Hitzig), for hēshı̄bh may mean
respirare, but not exspirare (if this were the meaning, it would be
better to read להשּׁיב from נשׁב, as Lowth does); nor "ut iram suam
furore sedet" (Meier), for even in [Job
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#013.md); [Psa
78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038.md), עפו השיב does not mean to still
or cool His wrath, but to turn it away or take it back; not even "to
direct His wrath in burning heat" (Ges., Kn.), for in this sense hēshı̄bh
would be connected with an object with ל, אל ([Job
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#013).md), על ([Isa
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025).md). It has rather the meaning
reddere in the sense of retribuere (Arab. athâba, syn. shillēm), and "to
pay back, or pay out, His wrath" is equivalent to hēshı̄bh nâqâm ([Deu
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041.md), [Deu
32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043).md), Hence עפו בחמה does not stand
in a permutative relation instead of a genitive one (viz., in fervore,
riâ suâ = irae suae), but is an adverbial definition, just as in [Isa
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025.md). That the payment of the wrath
deserved takes place in burning heat, and His rebuke (ge‛ârâh) in flames
of fire, are thoughts that answer to one another.

[Isaiah 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 66:16</span></span>

Jehovah appears with these warlike terrors because He is coming for a
great judgment. "For in the midst of fire Jehovah holds judgment, and in
the midst of His sword with all flesh; and great will be the multitude
of those pierced through by Jehovah." The fire, which is here introduced
as the medium of judgment, points to destructive occurrences of nature,
and the sword to destructive occurrences of history. At the same time
all the emphasis is laid here, as in [Isa
34:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md) (cf., [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md), upon the direct action of
Jehovah Himself. The parallelism in [Isa
66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016.md) is progressive. Nishpat 'ēth,
"to go into judgment with a person," as in [Eze
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022.md) (cf., עם in [Isa
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014.md), [Joe
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md); [Ch2
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#008.md); μετά, [Luk
11:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#031).md). We find a resemblance to
[Isa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016.md) in [Zep
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#012.md), and this is not the only
resemblance to our prophecy in that strongly reproductive prophet.

[Isaiah 66:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 66:17</span></span>

The judgment predicted here is a judgment upon nations, and falls not
only upon the heathen, but upon the great mass of Israel, who have
fallen away from their election of grace and become like the heathen.
"They that consecrate themselves and purify themselves for the gardens
behind one in the midst, who eat swine's flesh and abomination and the
field-mouse-they will come to an end together, saith Jehovah." The
persons are first of all described; and then follows the judgment
pronounced, as the predicate of the sentence. They subject themselves to
the heathen rites of lustration, and that with truly bigoted
thoroughness, as is clearly implied by the combination of the two
synonyms hammithqaddeshı̄m and hammittahărı̄m (hithpael with an
assimilated tav), which, like the Arabic qadusa and tahura, are both
traceable to the radical idea ἀφορίζειν. The אל of תונּגּה־לא is to be
understood as relating to the object or behoof: their intention being
directed to the gardens as places of worship ([Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md); [Isa
65:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#003).md), ad sacra in lucis obeunda, as
Shelling correctly explains. In the chethib בּתּוך אחד אחר, the אחד (for
which we may also read אחד, the form of connection, although the two
pathachs of the text belong to the keri) is in all probability the
hierophant, who leads the people in the performances of the rites of
religious worship and as he is represented as standing in the midst
(בּתּוך) of the worshipping crowd that surrounds him, 'achar (behind,
after) cannot be understood locally, as if they formed his train or
tail, but temporally or in the way of imitation. He who stands in their
midst performs the ceremonies before them, and they follow him, i.e.,
perform them after him. This explanation leaves nothing to be desired.
The keri, 'achath, is based upon the assumption that 'achad must refer
to the idol, and substitutes therefore the feminine, no doubt with an
allusion to 'ăshērâh, so that battâvekh (in the midst) is to be taken as
referring not to the midst of the worshipping congregation, but to the
midst of the gardens. This would be quite as suitable; for even if it
were not expressly stated, we should have to assume that the sacred tree
of Astarte, or her statue, occupied the post of honour in the midst of
the garden, and 'achar would correspond to the phrase in the Pentateuch,
אחרים אלהים אחרי זנה. But the foregoing expression, sanctificantes et
mundantes se (consecrating and purifying), does not favour this sense of
the word 'achar (why not ל = לכבוד?), nor do we see why the name of the
goddess should be suppressed, or why she should be simply hinted at in
the word אחת (one). אחד (אחד) has its sufficient explanation in the
antithesis between the one choir-leader and the many followers; but if
we take 'achath as referring to the goddess, we can find no intelligible
reason or object.

Some again have taken both 'achad and 'achath to be the proper name of
the idol. Ever since the time of Scaliger and Groitus, 'achad has been
associated with the Phoenician ̓́Αδωδος βασιλεὺς θεῶν mentioned by
Sanchuniathon in Euseb. praep. ev. 1, 10, 21, or with the Assyrian
sun-god Adad, of whom Macrobius says (Saturn. 1, 23), Ejus nominis
interpretatio significat unus; but we should expect the name of a
Babylonian god here, and not of a Phoenician or Assyrian (Syrian) deity.
Moreover, Macrobius' combination of the Syrian Hadad with 'achad was a
mere fancy, arising from an imperfect knowledge of the language.
Clericus' combination of 'achath with Hecate, who certainly appears to
have been worshipped by the Harranians as a monster, though not under
this name, and not in gardens (which would not have suited her
character), is also untenable. Now as 'achath cannot be explained as a
proper name, and the form of the statement does not favour the idea that
'achar 'achath or 'achar 'achad refers to an idol, we adopt the reading
'achad, and understand it to refer to the hierophant or mystagogue.
Jerome follows the keri, and renders it post unam intrinsecus. The
reading post januam is an ancient correction, which is not worth tracing
to the Aramaean interpretation of 'achar 'achad, "behind a closed door,"
and merely rests upon some rectification of the unintelligible post
unam. The Targum renders it, "one division after another," and omits
battâvekh. The lxx, on the other hand, omits 'achar 'achad, reads
ūbhattâvekh, and renders it καὶ ἐν τοῖς προθύροις (in the inner court).
Symmachus and Theodoret follow the Targum and Syriac, and render it
ὀπίσω ἀλλήλων, and then pointing the next word בּתוך (which Schelling
and Bttcher approve), render the rest ἐν μέσω ἐσθιόντων τὸ κρέας τὸ
χοιρεῖον (in the midst of those who eat, etc.). But אכלי commences the
further description of those who were indicated first of all by their
zealous adoption of heathen customs. Whilst, on the one hand, they
readily adopt the heathen ritual; they set themselves on the other hand,
in the most daring way, altogether above the law of Jehovah, by eating
swine's flesh ([Isa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#004).md) and reptiles
(sheqets, abomination, used for disgusting animals, such as lizards,
snails, etc., [Lev 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021.md); [Lev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#011).md),

(Note: See Levysohn, Zoologie des Talmuds, pp. 218-9.)

and more especially the mouse ([Lev
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#029).md), or according to Jerome and
Zwingli the dormouse (glis esculentus), which the Talmud also mentions
under the name דברא עכברא (wild mouse) as a dainty bit with epicures,
and which was fattened, as is well known, by the Romans in their
gliraria.

(Note: See Levysohn, id. pp. 108-9. A special delicacy was glires isicio
porcino, dormice with pork stuffing; see Brillat-Savarin's Physiologie
des Geschmacks, by C. Vogt, p. 253.)

However inward and spiritual may be the interpretation given to the law
in these prophecies, yet, as we see here, the whole of it, even the laws
of food, were regarded as inviolable. So long as God Himself had not
taken away the hedges set about His church, every wilful attempt to
break through them was a sin, which brought down His wrath and
indignation.

[Isaiah 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 66:18</span></span>

The prophecy now marks out clearly the way which the history of Israel
will take. It is the same as that set forth by Paul, the prophetic
apostle, in Rom 9-11 as the winding but memorable path by which the
compassion of God will reach its all-embracing end. A universal judgment
is the turning-point. "And I, their works and their thoughts - it comes
to pass that all nations and tongues are gathered together, that they
come and see my glory." This v. commences in any case with a harsh
ellipsis. Hofmann, who regards [Isa
66:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#017.md) as referring not to idolatrous
Israelites, but to the idolatrous world outside Israel, tries to meet
the difficulty by adopting this rendering: "And I, saith Jehovah, when
their thoughts and actions succeed in bringing together all nations and
tongues (to march against Jerusalem), they come and see my glory (i.e.,
the alarming manifestation of my power)." But what is the meaning of the
opening ואנכי (and I), which cannot possibly strengthen the distant
כּבודי, as we should be obliged to assume? Or what rule of syntax would
warrant our taking בּאה וּמחשׁבתיהם מעשׂיהם as a participial clause in
opposition to the accents? Again, it is impossible that ואנכי should
mean "et contra me;" or ומחשׁבתיהם מעשׂיהם, "in spite of their works and
thoughts," as Hahn supposes, which leaves ואנכי sevael hc quite
unexplained; not to mention other impossibilities which Ewald, Knobel,
and others have persuaded themselves to adopt. If we wanted to get rid
of the ellipsis, the explanation adopted by Hitzig would recommend
itself the most strongly, viz., "and as for me, their works and thoughts
have come, i.e., have become manifest (ἥκασιν, Susanna v. 52), so that I
shall gather together." But this separation of לקבּץ בּאה (it is going
to gather together) is improbable: moreover, according to the accents,
the first clause reaches as far as ומחסבתיהם (with the twin-accent
zakeph-munach instead of zakeph and metheg); whereupon the second clause
commences with באה, which could not have any other disjunctive accent
than zakeph gadol according to the well-defined rules (see, for example,
[Num 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027).md). But if we admit the
elliptical character of the expression, we have not to supply ידעתּי (I
know), as the Targ., Syr., Saad., Ges., and others do, but, what answers
much better to the strength of the emotion which explains the ellipsis,
אפקד (I will punish). The ellipsis is similar in character to that of
the "Quos ego" of Virgil (Aen. i. 139), and comes under the rhetorical
figure aposiopesis: "and I, their works and thoughts (I shall now how to
punish)." The thoughts are placed after the works, because the reference
is more especially to their plans against Jerusalem, that work of
theirs, which has still to be carried out, and which Jehovah turns into
a judgment upon them. The passage might have been continued with kı̄
mishpâtı̄ (for my judgment), like the derivative passage in [Zep
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md); but the emotional hurry of the
address is still preserved: בּאה (properly accented as a participle) is
equivalent to העת(בּא) בּאה in [Jer
51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033.md); [Eze
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#007.md), [Eze
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#012.md) (cf., הבּאים, [Isa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006).md). At the same time there is no
necessity to supply anything, since באה by itself may also be taken in a
neuter sense, and signify venturum (futurum) est ([Eze
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#008).md). The expression "peoples and
tongues" (as in the genealogy of the nations in Gen. 10) is not
tautological, since, although the distinctions of tongues and
nationalities coincided at first, yet in the course of history they
diverged from one another in many ways. All nations and all communities
of men speaking the same language does Jehovah bring together (including
the apostates of Israel, cf., [Zac
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#014).md): these will come, viz., as Joel
describes it in [Joe 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009.md)., impelled by
enmity towards Jerusalem, but not without the direction of Jehovah, who
makes even what is evil subservient to His plans, and will see His glory
- not the glory manifest in grace (Ewald, Umbreit, Stier, Hahn), but His
majestic manifestation of judgment, by which they, viz., those who have
been encoiled by sinful conduct, are completely overthrown.

[Isaiah 66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 66:19</span></span>

But a remnant escapes; and this remnant is employed by Jehovah to
promote the conversion of the Gentile world and the restoration of
Israel. "And I set a sign upon them, and send away those that have
escaped from them to the Gentiles to Tarshiish, Phl, and Ld, to the
stretchers of the bow, Tbal and Javan - the distant islands that have
not heard my fame and have not seen my glory, and they will proclaim my
glory among the Gentiles. And they will bring your brethren out of all
heathen nations, a sacrifice for Jehovah, upon horses and upon chariots,
and upon litters and upon mules and upon dromedaries, to my holy
mountain, to Jerusalem, saith Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring
the meat-offering in a clear vessel to the house of Jehovah." The
majority of commentators understand vesamtı̄ bâhem 'ōth (and I set a sign
upon them) as signifying, according to [Exo
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#002.md), that Jehovah will perform such a
miraculous sign upon the assembled nations as He formerly performed upon
Egypt (Hofmann), and one which will outweigh the ten Egyptian 'ōthōth
and complete the destruction commenced by them. Hitzig supposes the 'ōth
to refer directly to the horrible wonder connected with the battle, in
which Jehovah fights against them with fire and sword (compare the
parallels so far as the substance is concerned in [Joe
3:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#014.md), [Zep
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md), [Eze
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#018.md)., [Zac
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012)..md). But since, according to the
foregoing threat, the expression "they shall see my glory" signifies
that they will be brought to experience the judicial revelation of the
glory of Jehovah, if vesamtı̄ bâhem 'ōth (and I set a sign upon them)
were to be understood in this judicial sense, it would be more
appropriate for it to precede than to follow. Moreover, this vesamtı̄
bâhem 'ōth would be a very colourless description of what takes place in
connection with the assembled army of nations. It is like a frame
without a picture; and consequently Ewald and Umbreit are right in
maintaining that what follows directly after is to be taken as the
picture for this framework. The 'ōth (or sign) consists in the
unexpected and, with this universal slaughter, the surprising fact, that
a remnant is still spared, and survives this judicial revelation of
glory. This marvellous rescue of individuals out of the mass is made
subservient in the midst of judgment to the divine plan of salvation.
those who have escaped are to bring to the far distant heathen world the
tidings of Jehovah, the God who has been manifested in judgment and
grace, tidings founded upon their own experience. It is evident from
this, that notwithstanding the expression "all nations and tongues," the
nations that crowd together against Jerusalem and are overthrown in the
attempt, are not to be understood as embracing all nations without
exception, since the prophet is able to mention the names of many
nations which were beyond the circle of these great events, and had been
hitherto quite unaffected by the positive historical revelation, which
was concentrated in Israel. By Tarshish Knobel understand the nation of
the Tyrsenes, Tuscans, or Etruscans; but there is far greater propriety
in looking for Tarshish, as the opposite point to 'Ophir, in the extreme
west, where the name of the Spanish colony Tartessus resembles it in
sound. In the middle ages Tunis was combined with this. Instead of ולוּד
פּוּל we should probably read with the lxx ולוּד פּוּט, as in [Eze
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#010.md); [Eze
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005.md). Stier decides in favour of this,
whilst Hitzig and Ewald regard פול as another form of פוט. The epithet
קשׁת משׁכי (drawers of the bow) is admirably adapted to the inhabitants
of Pūt, since this people of the early Egyptian Phet (Phaiat) is
represented ideographically upon the monuments by nine bows. According
to Josephus, Ant. i. 6, 2, a river of Mauritania was called Phout, and
the adjoining country Phoute; and this is confirmed by other
testimonies. As Lud is by no means to be understood as referring to the
Lydians of Asia Minor here, if only because they could not well be
included among the nations of the farthest historico-geographical
horizon in a book which traces prophetically the victorious career of
Cyrus, but signifies rather the undoubtedly African tribe, the לוד which
Ezekiel mentions in [Isa 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#005.md) among
the nations under Egyptian rule, and in [Isa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#010.md) among the auxiliaries of the
Tyrians, and which Jeremiah notices in [Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md) along with Put as armed with
bows; Put and Lud form a fitting pair in this relation also, whereas Pul
is never met with again. The Targum renders it by פּוּלאי, i.e.,
(according to Bochart) inhabitants of Φιλαί, a Nile island of Upper
Egypt, which Strabo (xvii. 1, 49) calls "a common abode of Ethiopians
and Egyptians" (see Parthey's work, De Philis insula); and this is at
any rate better than Knobel's supposition, that either Apulia (which was
certainly called Pul by the Jews of the middle ages) or Lower Italy is
intended here. Tubal stands for the Tibarenes on the south-east coast of
the Black Sea, the neighbours of the Moschi (משׁך), with whom they are
frequently associated by Ezekiel ([Eze
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#013.md); [Eze
38:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#002.md); [Eze
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001).md); according to Josephus (Ant. i.
6, 1), the (Caucasian) Iberians. Javan is a name given to the Greeks,
from the aboriginal tribe of the Bawones. The eye is now directed
towards the west: the "isles afar off" are the islands standing out of
the great western sea (the Mediterranean), and the coastlands that
project into it. To all these nations, which have hitherto known nothing
of the God of revelation, either through the hearing of the word or
through their own experience, Jehovah sends those who have escaped; and
they make known His glory there, that glory the judicial manifestation
of which they have just seen for themselves.

The prophet is speaking here of the ultimate completion of the
conversion of the Gentiles; for elsewhere this appeared to him as the
work of the Servant of Jehovah, for which Cyrus the oppressor of the
nations prepared the soil. His standpoint here resembles that of the
apostle in [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md), who describes
the conversion of the heathen world and the rescue of all Israel as
facts belonging to the future; although at the time when he wrote this,
the evangelization of the heathen foretold by our prophet in [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md). was already progressing most
rapidly. A direct judicial act of God Himself will ultimately determine
the entrance of the Pleroma of the Gentiles into the kingdom of God, and
this entrance of the fulness of the Gentiles will then lead to the
recovery of the diaspora of Israel, since the heathen, when won by the
testimony borne to Jehovah by those who have been saved, "bring your
brethren out of all nations." On the means employed to carry this into
effect, including kirkârōth, a species of camels (female camels), which
derives its name from its rapid swaying motion, see the Lexicons.

(Note: The lxx render it σκιαδίων, i.e., probably palanquins. Jerome
observes on this, quae nos dormitoria interpretari possumus vel
basternas. (On this word, with which the name of the Bastarnians as
̔Αμαξόβιοι is connected, see Hahnel's Bedeutung der Bastarner fr das
german. Alterthum, 1865, p. 34.))

The words are addressed, as in [Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md), to the exiles of Babylonia. The
prophet presupposes that his countrymen are dispersed among all nations
to the farthest extremity of the geographical horizon. In fact, the
commerce of the Israelites, which had extended as far as India and Spain
ever since the time of Solomon, the sale of Jewish prisoners as slaves
to Phoenicians, Edomites, and Greeks in the time of king Joram ([Oba
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#020.md); [Joe
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006.md); [Amo
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006).md), the Assyrian captivities, the
free emigrations - for example, of those who stayed behind in the land
after the destruction of Jerusalem and then went down to Egypt - had
already scattered the Israelites over the whole of the known world (see
at [Isa 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#012).md). Umbreit is of opinion
that the prophet calls all the nations who had turned to Jehovah
"brethren of Israel," and represents them as marching in the most motley
grouping to the holy city. In that case those who were brought upon
horses, chariots, etc., would be proselytes; but who would bring them?
This explanation is opposed not only to numerous parallels in Isaiah,
such as [Isa 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004.md), but also to the
abridgment of the passage in [Zep 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010.md)
: "From the other side of the rivers of Ethiopia (taken from [Isa
18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001).md) will they offer my
worshippers, the daughters of my dispersed ones, to me for a holy
offering." It is the diaspora of Israel to which the significant name
"my worshippers, the daughters of my dispersed ones," is there applied.
The figure hinted at in minchâtı̄ (my holy offering) is given more
elaborately here in the book of Isaiah, viz., "as the children of Israel
are accustomed (fut. as in [Isa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002).md)
to offer the meat-offering" (i.e., that which was to be placed upon the
altar as such, viz., wheaten flour, incense, oil, the grains of the
first-fruits of wheat, etc.) "in a pure vessel to the house of Jehovah,"
not in the house of Jehovah, for the point of comparison is not the
presentation in the temple, but the bringing to the temple. The minchah
is the diaspora of Israel, and the heathen who have become vessels of
honour correspond to the clean vessels.

[Isaiah 66:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 66:21</span></span>

The latter, having been incorporated into the priestly congregation of
Jehovah ([Isa 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006).md), are not even
excluded from the priestly and Levitical service of the sanctuary. "And
I will also add some of them to the priests, to the Levites, saith
Jehovah." Hitzig and Knobel suppose mēhem to refer to the Israelites
thus brought home. But in this case something would be promised, which
needed no promise at all, since the right of the native cohen and
Levites to take part in the priesthood and temple service was by no
means neutralized by their sojourn in a foreign land. And even if the
meaning were that Jehovah would take those who were brought home for
priests and Levites, without regard to their Aaronic or priestly
descent, or (as Jewish commentators explain it) without regard to the
apostasy, of which through weakness they had made themselves guilty
among the heathen; this ought to be expressly stated. But as there is
nothing said about any such disregard of priestly descent or apostasy,
and what is here promised must be something extraordinary, and not
self-evident, meehem must refer to the converted heathen, by whom the
Israelites had been brought home. Many Jewish commentators even are
unable to throw off the impression thus made by the expression mēhem (of
them); but they attempt to get rid of the apparent discrepancy between
this statement and the Mosaic law, by understanding by the Gentiles
those who had been originally Israelites of Levitical and Aaronic
descent, and whom Jehovah would single out again. David Friedlnder and
David Ottensosser interpret it quite correctly thus: "Mēhem, i.e., of
those heathen who bring them home, will He take for priests and Levites,
for all will be saints of Jehovah; and therefore He has just compared
them to a clean vessel, and the Israelites offered by their hand to a
minchâh." The majority of commentators do not even ask the question, in
what sense the prophet uses lakkōhănı̄m lalevayyim (to the priests, to
the Levites) with the article. Joseph Kimchi, however, explains it thus:
"הכהנים לצורך, to the service of the priests, the Levites, so that they
(the converted heathen) take the place of the Gibeonites (cf., [Zac
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021).md), and therefore of the former
Cananaean nethı̄nı̄m" (see Khler, Nach-exil. Proph. iii. p. 39). But so
interpreted, the substance of the promise falls behind the expectation
aroused by מהם וגם. Hofmann has adopted a more correct explanation,
viz.: "God rewards them for this offering, by taking priests to Himself
out of the number of the offering priests, who are added as such to the
Levitical priests." Apart, however, from the fact that ללוים לכהנים
cannot well signify "for Levitical priests" according to the
Deuteronomic הכהנים, since this would require הלוים לכהנים (inasmuch as
such permutative and more precisely defining expressions as [Gen
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#009.md); [Jos
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#024.md) cannot be brought into
comparison); the idea "in addition to the priests, to the Levites," is
really implied in the expression (cf., [Isa
56:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#008).md), as they would say לאשּׁה לקח
and not לאשׁה, and would only use לנּשׁים לקח in the sense of adding to
those already there. The article presupposes the existence of priests,
Levites (asyndeton, as in [Isa 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014.md);
[Isa 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029.md); [Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005).md), to whom Jehovah adds some taken
from the heathen. When the heathen shall be converted, and Israel
brought back, the temple service will demand a more numerous priesthood
and Levitehood than ever before; and Jehovah will then increase the
number of those already existing, not only from the מובאים, but from the
מביאים also. The very same spirit, which broke through all the
restraints of the law in [Isa 56:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md),
is to be seen at work here as well. Those who suppose mēhem to refer to
the Israelites are wrong in saying that there is no other way, in which
the connection with [Isa 66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md) can be
made intelligible. Friedlnder had a certain feeling of what was right,
when he took [Isa 66:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#021.md) to be a
parenthesis and connected [Isa 66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md)
with [Isa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md). There is no necessity
for any parenthesis, however. The reason which follows, relates to the
whole of the previous promise, including [Isa
66:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#021.md); the election of Israel, as
Hofmann observes, being equally confirmed by the fact that the heathen
exert themselves to bring back the diaspora of Israel to their sacred
home, and also by the fact that the highest reward granted to them is,
that some of them are permitted to take part in the priestly and
Levitical service of the sanctuary.

[Isaiah 66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 66:22</span></span>

"For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I am about to make,
continue before me, saith Jehovah, so will your family and your name
continue." The great mass of the world of nations and of Israel also
perish; but the seed and name of Israel, i.e., Israel as a people with
the same ancestors and an independent name, continues for ever, like the
new heaven and the new earth; and because the calling of Israel towards
the world of nations is now fulfilled and everything has become new, the
former fencing off of Israel from other nations comes to an end, and the
qualification for priesthood and Levitical office in the temple of God
is no longer merely natural descent, but inward nobility. The new heaven
and the new earth, God's approaching creation (quae facturus sum),
continue eternally before Him (lephânai as in [Isa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016).md), for the old ones pass away
because they do not please God; but these are pleasing to Him, and are
eternally like His love, whose work and image they are. The prophet here
thinks of the church of the future as being upon a new earth and under a
new heaven. But he cannot conceive of the eternal in the form of
eternity; all that he can do is to conceive of it as the endless
continuance of the history of time.

[Isaiah 66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 66:23</span></span>

"And it will come to pass: from new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath
to Sabbath, all flesh will come, to worship before me, saith Jehovah."
New moons and Sabbaths will still be celebrated therefore; and the
difference is simply this, that just as all Israel once assembled in
Jerusalem at the three great feasts, all flesh now journey to Jerusalem
every new moon and every Sabbath. דּי (construct דּי) signifies that
which suffices, then that which is plentiful (see [Isa
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#016).md), that which is due or fitting,
so that (שׁבת) חדשׁ מדּי (with a temporal, not an explanatory min, as
Gesenius supposes) signifies "from the time when, or as often as what is
befitting to the new moon (or Sabbath) occurs" (cf., [Isa
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#019)). If (בשׁבת.md) בחדשׁ be added, בּ
is that of exchange: as often as new moon (Sabbath) for new moon
(Sabbath) is befitting, i.e., ought to occur: [Sa1
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#016.md); [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md) (cf., [Sa1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#007.md); [Kg1
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#025.md); [Ch1
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001.md) : "year by year," "month by
month"). When we find (בּשׁבּתּו) בּחדשׁו as we do here, the meaning is,
"as often as it has to occur on one new moon (or Sabbath) after the
other," i.e., in the periodical succession of one after another. At the
same time it might be interpreted in accordance with [Kg1
8:59](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#059.md), בּיומו יום דּבר, which does not
mean the obligation of one day after the other, but rather "of a day on
the fitting day" (cf., [Num 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#010.md),
[Num 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#014).md), although the meaning of
change and not of a series might be sustained in the passage before us
by the suffixless mode of expression which occurs in connection with it.

[Isaiah 66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 66:24</span></span>

They who go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem every new moon and Sabbath, see
there with their own eyes the terrible punishment of the rebellious.
"And they go out and look at the corpses of the men that have rebelled
against me, for their worm will not die and their fire will not be
quenched, and they become an abomination to all flesh." They perfects
are perf. cons. regulated by the foregoing יבוא. ויצאוּ (accented with
pashta in our editions, but more correctly with munach) refers to their
going out of the holy city. The prophet had predicted in [Isa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018.md), that in the last times the
whole multitude of the enemies of Jerusalem would be crowded together
against it, in the hope of getting possession of it. This accounts for
the fact that the neighbourhood of Jerusalem becomes such a scene of
divine judgment. בּ ראה always denotes a fixed, lingering look directed
to any object; here it is connected with the grateful feeling of
satisfaction at the righteous acts of God and their own gracious
deliverance. דראון, which only occurs again in [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md), is the strongest word for
"abomination." It is very difficult to imagine the picture which floated
before the prophet's mind. How is it possible that all flesh, i.e., all
men of all nations, should find room in Jerusalem and the temple? Even
if the city and temple should be enlarged, as Ezekiel and Zechariah
predict, the thing itself still remains inconceivable. And again, how
can corpses be eaten by worms at the same time as they are being burned,
or how can they be the endless prey of worms and fire without
disappearing altogether from the sight of man? It is perfectly obvious,
that the thing itself, as here described, must appear monstrous and
inconceivable, however we may suppose it to be realized. The prophet, by
the very mode of description adopted by him, precludes the possibility
of our conceiving of the thing here set forth as realized in any
material form in this present state. He is speaking of the future state,
but in figures drawn from the present world. The object of his
prediction is no other than the new Jerusalem of the world to come, and
the eternal torment of the damned; but the way in which he pictures it,
forces us to translate it out of the figures drawn from this life into
the realities of the life to come; as has already been done in the
apocryphal books of Judith (16:17) and Wisdom (7:17), as well as in the
New Testament, e.g., [Mar 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043.md)., with
evident reference to this passage. This is just the distinction between
the Old Testament and the New, that the Old Testament brings down the
life to come to the level of this life, whilst the New Testament lifts
up this life to the level of the life to come; that the Old Testament
depicts both this life and the life to come as an endless extension of
this life, whilst the New Testament depicts is as a continuous line in
two halves, the last point in this finite state being the first point of
the infinite state beyond; that the Old Testament preserves the
continuity of this life and the life to come by transferring the outer
side, the form, the appearance of this life to the life to come, the New
Testament by making the inner side, the nature, the reality of the life
to come, the δυνάμεις με λλοντος αἰῶνος, immanent in this life. The new
Jerusalem of our prophet has indeed a new heaven above it and a new
earth under it, but it is only the old Jerusalem of earth lifted up to
its highest glory and happiness; whereas the new Jerusalem of the
Apocalypse comes down from heaven, and is therefore of heavenly nature.
In the former dwells the Israel that has been brought back from
captivity; in the latter, the risen church of those who are written in
the book of life. And whilst our prophet transfers the place in which
the rebellious are judged to the neighbourhood of Jerusalem itself; in
the Apocalypse, the lake of fire in which the life of the ungodly is
consumed, and the abode of God with men, are for ever separated. The
Hinnom-valley outside Jerusalem has become Gehenna, and this is no
longer within the precincts of the new Jerusalem, because there is no
need of any such example to the righteous who are for ever perfect.

In the lessons prepared for the synagogue [Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023.md) is repeated after [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md), on account of the terrible
character of the latter, "so as to close with words of consolation."

(Note: Isaiah is therefore regarded as an exception to the rule, that
the prophets close their orations ותנחומים שבח בדברי (b. Berachoth 31a),
although, on the other hand, this exception is denied by some, on the
ground that the words "they shall be an abhorring" apply to the Gentiles
(j. Berachoth c. V. Anf. Midras Tillim on [Psa
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008))..md)

But the prophet, who has sealed the first two sections of these
prophetic orations with the words, "there is no peace to the wicked,"
intentionally closes the third section with this terrible picture of
their want of peace. The promises have gradually soared into the clear
light of the eternal glory, to the new creation in eternity; and the
threatenings have sunk down to the depth of eternal torment, which is
the eternal foil of the eternal light. More than this we could not
expect from our prophet. His threefold book is now concluded. It
consists of twenty-seven orations. The central one of the whole, i.e.,
the fourteenth, is Isaiah 52:13-53:12; so that the cross forms the
centre of this prophetic trilogy. Per crucem ad lucem is its watchword.
The self-sacrifice of the Servant of Jehovah lays the foundation for a
new Israel, a new human race, a new heaven and a new earth.
