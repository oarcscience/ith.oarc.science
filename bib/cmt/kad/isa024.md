Finale of the Great Catastrophe - Isaiah 24-27 part iv

The cycle of prophecies which commences here has no other parallel in
the Old Testament than perhaps Zech. Both sections are thoroughly
eschatological and apocryphal in their character, and start from
apparently sharply defined historical circumstances, which vanish,
however, like will-o'the-wisps, as soon as you attempt to follow and
seize them; for the simple reason, that the prophet lays hold of their
radical idea, carries them out beyond their outward historical form, and
uses them as emblems of far-off events of the last days. It is not
surprising, therefore, that the majority of modern critics, from the
time of Eichhorn and Koppe, have denied the genuineness of these four
chapters (Isaiah 24-27), notwithstanding the fact that there is nothing
in the words themselves that passes beyond the Assyrian times.
Rosenmller did this in the first edition of his Scholia; but in the
second and third editions he has fallen into another error, chiefly
because the prophecy contains nothing which passes beyond the political
horizon of Isaiah's own times. Now we cannot accept this test of
genuineness; it is just one of the will-o'-the-wisps already referred
to. Another consequence of this phenomenon is, that our critical
opponents inevitably get entangled in contradictions as soon as they
seek for a different historical basis for this cycle of prophecies from
that of Isaiah's own times. According to Gesenius, De Wette, Maurer, and
Umbreit, the author wrote in Babylonia; according to Eichhorn, Ewald,
and Knobel, in Judah. In the opinion of some, he wrote at the close of
the captivity; in that of others, immediately after the overthrow of the
kingdom of Judah. Hitzig supposes the imperial city, whose destruction
is predicted, to be Nineveh; others, for the most part, suppose it to be
Babylon. But the prophet only mentions Egypt and Asshur as powers by
which Israel is enslaved; and Knobel consequently imagines that he wrote
in this figurative manner from fear of the enemies that were still
dwelling in Judah. This wavering arises from the fact, that what is
apparently historical is simply an eschatological emblem. It is quite
impossible to determine whether that which sounds historical belonged to
the present or past in relation to the prophet himself. His
standing-place was beyond all the history that has passed by, even down
to the present day; and everything belonging to this history was merely
a figure in the mirror of the last lines. Let it be once established
that no human critics can determine priori the measure of divine
revelation granted to any prophet, and all possible grounds combine to
vindicate Isaiah's authorship of chapters 24-27, as demanded by its
place in the book of Isaiah.

(Note: The genuineness is supported by Rosenmller, Hensler (Jesaia neu
bersetzt, mit Anm.), Paulus (Clavis ber Jesaia), Augusti (Exeg.
Handbuch), Beckhaus (ber Integritt der proph. Schriften des A. T. 1796),
Kleinert (ber die Echtheit smmtlicher in d. Buche Jesaia enth.
Weissagungen, 1829), Kper (Jeremias librorum sacr. interpres atque
vindex, 1837), and Jahn, Hvernick, Keil (in their Introductions). In
monographs, C. F. L. Arndt (De loco, c. xxiv. - xxvii., Jesaiae
vindicando et explicando, 1826), and Ed. Bhl (Vaticinium Jes. cap. xxiv.
- xxvii. commentario illustr. 1861).)

Appended as they are to chapters 13-23 without a distinct heading, they
are intended to stand in a relation of steady progress to the oracles
concerning the nations; and this relation is sustained by the fact that
Jeremiah read them in connection with these oracles (compare [Isa
24:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#017.md), with [Jer
48:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#043).md), and that they are full of
retrospective allusions, which run out like a hundred threads, though
grasped, as it were, in a single hand. Chapters 24-27 stand in the same
relation to chapters 13-23, as chapters 11, [Isa
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md) to chapters 7-10. The
particular judgments predicted in the oracle against the nations, all
flow into the last judgment as into a sea; and all the salvation which
formed the shining edge of the oracles against the nations, is here
concentrated in the glory of a mid-day sun. Chapters 24-27 form the
finale to chapters 13-23, and that in a strictly musical sense. What the
finale should do in a piece of music - namely, gather up the scattered
changes into a grand impressive whole - is done here by this closing
cycle. But even part from this, it is full of music and song. The
description of the catastrophe in chapter 24 is followed by a simple
hymnal echo. As the book of Immanuel closes in [Isa
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md) with a psalm of the redeemed,
so have we here a fourfold song of praise. The overthrow of the imperial
city is celebrated in a song in [Isa
25:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md); another song in [Isa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md) describes how Jehovah reveals
himself with His saving presence; another in Isaiah 26:1-19 celebrates
the restoration and resurrection of Israel; and a fourth in [Isa
27:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002.md) describes the vineyard of the
church bringing forth fruit under the protection of Jehovah. And these
songs contain every variety, from the most elevated heavenly hymn to the
tenderest popular song. It is a grand manifold concert, which is merely
introduced, as it were, by the epic opening in chapter 24 and the epic
close in [Isa 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006.md)., and in the midst
of which the prophecy unfolds itself in a kind of recitative. Moreover,
we do not find so much real music anywhere else in the ring of the
words. The heaping up of paronomasia has been placed among the arguments
against the genuineness of these chapters. But we have already shown by
many examples, drawn from undisputed prophecies (such as [Isa
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#005.md); [Isa
17:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012).md), that Isaiah is fond of
painting for the ear; and the reason why he does it here more than
anywhere else, is that chapters 24-27 formed a finale that was intended
to surpass all that had gone before. The whole of this finale is a grand
hallelujah to chapters 13-23, hymnic in its character, and musical in
form, and that to such a degree, that, like [Isa
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md), the prophecy is, as it were,
both text and divisions at the same time. There was no other than Isaiah
who was so incomparable a master of language. Again, the incomparable
depth in the contents of chapters 24-27 does not shake our confidence in
his authorship, since the whole book of this Solomon among the prophets
is full of what is incomparable. And in addition to much that is
peculiar in this cycle of prophecies, which does not astonish us in a
prophet so richly endowed, and so characterized by a continual change
"from glory to glory," the whole cycle is so thoroughly Isaiah's in its
deepest foundation, and in a hundred points of detail, that it is most
uncritical to pronounce the whole to be certainly not Isaiah's simply
because of these peculiarities. So far as the eschatological and
apocalyptical contents, which seem to point to a very late period, are
concerned, we would simply call to mind the wealth of eschatological
ideas to be found even in Joel, who prophesies of the pouring out of the
Spirit, the march of the nations of the world against the church, the
signs that precede the last day, the miraculous water of the New
Jerusalem. The revelation of all the last things, which the Apocalypse
of the New Testament embraces in one grand picture, commenced with
Obadiah and Joel; and there is nothing strange in the fact that Isaiah
also, in chapters 24-27, should turn away from the immediate external
facts of the history of his own time, and pass on to these depths
beyond.

[Isaiah 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 24:1</span></span>

It is thoroughly characteristic of Isaiah, that the commencement of this
prophecy, like [Isa 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md), places us at
once in the very midst of the catastrophe, and condenses the contents of
the subsequent picture of judgment into a few rapid, vigorous, vivid,
and comprehensive clauses (like [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md); [Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md); [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md), cf., [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001).md). "Behold, Jehovah emptieth the
earth, and layeth it waste, and marreth its form, and scattereth its
inhabitants. And it happeneth, as to the people, so to the priest; as to
the servant, so to his master; as to the maid, so to her mistress; as to
the buyer, so to the seller; as to the lender, so to the borrower; as to
the creditor, so to the debtor. Emptying the earth is emptied, and
plundering is plundered: for Jehovah hat spoken this word." The
question, whether the prophet is speaking of a past of future judgment,
which is one of importance to the interpretation of the whole, is
answered by the fact that with Isaiah "hinnēh" (behold) always refers to
something future ([Isa 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md); [Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md); [Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md); [Isa
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027), etc..md). And it is only in his
case, that we do meet with prophecies commencing so immediately with
hinnēh. Those in Jeremiah which approach this the most nearly (viz.,
[Jer 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#002.md); [Jer
49:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#035.md), cf., [Isa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md), and [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003).md) do indeed commence with hinnēh,
but not without being preceded by an introductory formula. The opening
"behold" corresponds to the confirmatory "for Jehovah hath spoken,"
which is always employed by Isaiah at the close of statements with
regard to the future and occurs chiefly,

(Note: Vid., [Isa 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#020.md); [Isa
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#017.md); [Isa
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#025.md); [Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md); [Isa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005.md); [Isa
58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014.md); also compare [Isa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md); [Isa
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#013.md), and [Isa
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#022)..md)

though not exclusively,

(Note: Vid., [Oba 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#018.md), [Joe
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#008.md), [Mic
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004.md); [Kg1
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#011)..md)

in the book of Isaiah, whom we may recognise in the detailed description
in [Isa 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002.md) (vid., [Isa
2:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012.md); [Isa
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002.md), [Isa
3:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#018.md), as compared with [Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013.md); also with the description of
judgment in [Isa 19:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md), which closes
in a similar manner). Thus at the very outset we meet with Isaiah's
peculiarities; and Caspari is right in saying that no prophecy could
possibly commence with more of the characteristics of Isaiah than the
prophecy before us. The play upon words commences at the very outset.
Bâkak and bâlak (compare the Arabic ballūka, a blank, naked desert) have
the same ring, just as in [Nah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011.md),
cf., [Isa 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#003.md), and [Jer
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#002.md). The niphal futures are
intentionally written like verbs Pe-Vâv (tibbōk and tibbōz, instead of
tibbak and tibbaz), for the purpose of making them rhyme with the
infinitive absolutes (cf., [Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013).md). So, again, caggebirtâh is so
written instead of cigbirtâh, to produce a greater resemblance to the
opening syllable of the other words. The form נשׁה is interchanged with
נשׁא) (as in [Sa1 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002).md), or, according
to Kimchi's way of writing it, with נשׁא) (written with tzere), just as
in other passages we meet with נשׁא along with נשׁה, and, judging from
Arab. ns', to postpone or credit, the former is the primary form. Nōsheh
is the creditor, and בו נשׁא אשׁר is not the person who has borrowed of
him, but, as נשה invariably signifies to credit (hiphil, to give
credit), the person whom he credits (with ב obj., like בּ נגשׂ in [Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003).md), not "the person through whom he
is נשׁא)" (Hitzig on [Jer 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010).md).
Hence, "lender and borrower, creditor and debtor" (or taker of credit).
It is a judgment which embraces all, without distinction of rank and
condition; and it is a universal one, not merely throughout the whole of
the land of Israel (as even Drechsler renders הארץ), but in all the
earth; for as Arndt correctly observes, הארץ signifies "the earth" in
this passage, including, as in [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md), the ethical New Testament idea
of "the world" (kosmos).

[Isaiah 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 24:4</span></span>

That this is the case is evident from [Isa
24:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004.md), where the accursed state into
which the earth is brought is more fully described, and the cause
thereof is given. "Smitten down, withered up is the earth; pined away,
wasted away is the world; pined away have they, the foremost of the
people of the earth. And the earth has become wicked among its
inhabitants; for they transgressed revelations, set at nought the
ordinance, broke the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse
devoured the earth, and they who dwelt in it make expiation: therefore
are the inhabitants of the earth withered up, and there are very few
mortals left. New wine mourneth, vine is parched, all the merry-hearted
groan. The joyous playing of tabrets is silent; the noise of them that
rejoice hath ceased; the joyous playing of the guitar is silent. They
drink no wine with a song; meth tastes bitter to them that drink it."
"The world" (tēbēl) is used here in [Isa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004.md), as in [Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009.md) (always in the form of a proper
name, and without the article), as a parallel to "the earth" (hâ'âretz),
with which it alternates throughout this cycle of prophecies. It is used
poetically to signify the globe, and that without limitation (even in
[Isa 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011.md) and [Isa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003).md); and therefore "the earth" is
also to be understood here in its most comprehensive sense (in a
different sense, therefore, from [Isa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009.md), which contains the same play
upon sounds). The earth is sunk in mourning, and has become like a faded
plant, withered up with heat; the high ones of the people of the earth
(merōm; abstr. pro concr., like câbōd in [Isa
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md); [Isa
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#024).md) are included (עם is used, as in
[Isa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005.md); [Isa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007.md), to signify humanity, i.e., man
generally). אמללוּ (for the form, see Comm. on Job, at [Job
18:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016).md) stands in half pause, which
throws the subjective notion that follows into greater prominence. It is
the punishment of the inhabitants of the earth, which the earth has to
share, because it has shared in the wickedness of those who live upon
it: chânaph (not related to tânaph) signifies to be degenerate, to have
decided for what is evil ([Isa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#016).md),
to be wicked; and in this intransitive sense it is applied to the land,
which is said to be affected with the guilt of wicked, reckless conduct,
more especially of blood-guiltiness ([Psa
106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038.md); [Num
35:33](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#033.md); compare the transitive use in
[Jer 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009).md). The wicked conduct of men,
which has caused the earth also to become chanēphâh, is described in
three short, rapid, involuntarily excited sentences (compare [Isa
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006.md); [Isa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004.md); [Isa
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md); [Isa
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008.md); also [Isa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#005.md); [Isa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004.md), [Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006.md), [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008.md); out of the book of Isaiah,
however, we only meet with this in [Joe
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010.md), and possibly [Jos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#011).md). Understanding "the earth" as we
do in a general sense, "the law" cannot signify merely the positive law
of Israel. The Gentile world had also a torâh or divine teaching within,
which contained an abundance of divine directions (tōrōth). They also
had a law written in their hearts; and it was with the whole human race
that God concluded a covenant in the person of Noah, at a time when the
nations had none of them come into existence at all. This is the
explanation given by even Jewish commentators; nevertheless, we must not
forget that Israel was included among the transgressors, and the choice
of expression was determined by this. With the expression "therefore"
the prophecy moves on from sin to punishment, just as in [Isa
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md) (cf., [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024).md). אלה is the curse of God
denounced against the transgressors of His law ([Dan
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011.md); compare [Jer
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010.md), which is founded upon this, and
from which אבלה has been introduced into this passage in some codices
and editions). The curse of God devours, for it is fire, and that from
within outwards (see [Isa 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#031.md); [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md); [Isa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018.md); [Isa
10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md); [Isa
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md); [Isa
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md)., [Isa
33:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011).md): chârū (milel, since pashta
is an acc. postpos.),

(Note: In correct texts châr has two pashtas, the former indicating the
place of the tone.)

from chârar, they are burnt up, exusti. With regard to ויּאשׁמוּ, it is
hardly necessary to observe that it cannot be traced back to אשׁם =
ישׁם, שׁמם; and that of the two meanings, culpam contrahere and culpam
sustinere, it has the latter meaning here. We must not overlook the
genuine mark of Isaiah here in the description of the vanishing away of
men down to a small remnant: נשׁאר (שׁאר) is the standing word used to
denote this; מזער (used with regard to number both here and in [Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md); and with regard to time in [Isa
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#025.md) and [Isa
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017).md) is exclusively Isaiah's; and
אנושׁ is used in the same sense as in [Isa
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008.md) (cf., [Isa
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#012).md). In [Isa
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#007.md) we are reminded of Joel 1 (on the
short sentences, see [Isa 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md); [Isa
16:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008).md); in [Isa
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008.md), [Isa
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#009.md) any one acquainted with Isaiah's
style will recall to mind not only [Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md), [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md), but a multitude of other
parallels. We content ourselves with pointing to עלּיז (which belongs
exclusively to Isaiah, and is taken from [Isa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002.md) and [Isa
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013.md) in [Zep
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015.md), and from [Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003.md) in [Zep
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011).md); and for basshir (with joyous
song) to [Isa 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032.md) (with the beating
of drums and playing of guitars), together with [Isa
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md). The picture is elegiac, and
dwells so long upon the wine (cf., [Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001).md), just because wine, both as a
natural production and in the form of drink, is the most exhilarating to
the heart of all the natural gifts of God ([Psa
104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md); [Jdg
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#013).md). All the sources of joy and
gladness are destroyed; and even if there is much still left of that
which ought to give enjoyment, the taste of the men themselves turns it
into bitterness.

[Isaiah 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 24:10</span></span>

The world with its pleasure is judged; the world's city is also judged,
in which both the world's power and the world's pleasure were
concentrated. "The city of tohu is broken to pieces; every house is shut
up, so that no man can come in. There is lamentation for wine in the
fields; all rejoicing has set; the delight of the earth is banished.
What is left of the city is wilderness, and the gate was shattered to
ruins. For so will it be within the earth, in the midst of the nations;
as at the olive-beating, as at the gleaning, when the vintage is over."
The city of tohu (kiryath tōhu): this cannot be taken collectively, as
Rosenmller, Arndt, and Drechsler suppose, on account of the annexation
of kiryath to tohu, which is turned into a kind of proper name; for can
we understand it as referring to Jerusalem, as the majority of
commentators have done, including even Schegg and Stier (according to
[Isa 32:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013).md), after we have taken
"the earth" (hâ'âretz) in the sense of kosmos (the world). It is rather
the central city of the world as estranged from God; and it is here
designated according to its end, which end will be tohu, as its nature
was tohu. Its true nature was the breaking up of the harmony of all
divine order; and so its end will be the breaking up of its own
standing, and a hurling back, as it were, into the chaos of its primeval
beginning. With a very similar significance Rome is called turbida Roma
in Persius (i. 5). The whole is thoroughly Isaiah's, even to the finest
points: tohu is the same as in [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md); and for the expression מבּוא
(so that you cannot enter; namely, on account of the ruins which block
up the doorway) compare [Isa 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md);
[Isa 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md); [Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md), also [Isa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009.md); [Isa
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#011.md); [Isa
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013.md). The cry or lamentation for the
wine out in the fields ([Isa 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#011.md);
cf., [Job 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#010).md) is the mourning on
account of the destruction of the vineyards; the vine, which is one of
Isaiah's most favourite symbols, represents in this instance also all
the natural sources of joy. In the term ‛ârbâh (rejoicing) the relation
between joy and light is presupposed; the sun of joy is set (compare
[Mic 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006).md). What remains of the city
בּעיר is partitive, just as בּו in [Isa
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022)) is shammâh (desolation.md), to
which the whole city has been brought (compare [Isa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009.md); [Isa
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#014).md). The strong gates, which once
swarmed with men, are shattered to ruins (yuccath, like [Mic
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#007.md), for yūcath, Ges. 67, Anm. 8;
שׁאיּה, ἁπ λεγ, a predicating noun of sequence, as in [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026.md), "into desolated heaps;" compare
[Isa 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#011), etc., and other passages.md).
In the whole circuit of the earth ([Isa
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#012.md); [Isa
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022.md); hâ'âretz is "the earth" here as
in [Isa 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md); [Isa
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#024).md), and in the midst of what was
once a crowd of nations (compare [Mic
5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006).md), there is only a small remnant
of men left. This is the leading thought, which runs through the book of
Isaiah from beginning to end, and is figuratively depicted here in a
miniature of [Isa 17:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#004.md). The state of
things produced by the catastrophe is compared to the olive-beating,
which fetches down what fruit was left at the general picking, and to
the gleaning of the grapes after the vintage has been fully gathered in
(câlâh is used here as in [Isa 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#025.md);
[Isa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004.md); [Isa
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#016.md), etc., viz., "to be over,"
whereas in [Isa 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010.md) it means to be
hopelessly lost, as in [Isa 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006).md).
There are no more men in the whole of the wide world than there are of
olives and grapes after the principal gathering has taken place. The
persons saved belong chiefly, though not exclusively, to Israel ([Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005).md). The place where they assemble is
the land of promise.

[Isaiah 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 24:14</span></span>

There is now a church there refined by the judgment, and rejoicing in
its apostolic calling to the whole world. "They will lift up their
voice, and exult; for the majesty of Jehovah they shout from the sea:
therefore praise ye Jehovah in the lands of the sun, in the islands of
the sea the name of Jehovah the God of Israel." The ground and subject
of the rejoicing is "the majesty of Jehovah," i.e., the fact that
Jehovah had shown Himself so majestic in judgment and mercy ([Isa
12:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#005).md), and was now so manifest in
His glory ([Isa 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md), [Isa
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017).md). Therefore rejoicing was heard
"from the sea" (the Mediterranean), by which the abode of the
congregation of Jehovah was washed. Turning in that direction, it had
the islands and coast lands of the European West in front (iyyi hayyâm;
the only other passage in which this occurs is [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md), cf., [Eze
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#018).md), and at its back the lands of
the Asiatic East, which are called 'urim, the lands of light, i.e., of
the sun-rising. This is the true meaning of 'urim, as J. Schelling and
Drechsler agree; for Dderlein's comparison of the rare Arabic word awr,
septentrio is as far removed from the Hebrew usage as that of the Talmud
אור אורתּא, vespera. Hitzig's proposed reading באיים (according to the
lxx) diminishes the substance and destroys the beauty of the appeal,
which goes forth both to the east and west, and summons to the praise of
the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, על־כּן, i.e., because of His
manifested glory. His "name" (cf., [Isa
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027).md) is His nature as revealed and
made "nameable" in judgment and mercy.

[Isaiah 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 24:16</span></span>

This appeal is not made in vain. [Isa
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016.md). "From the border of the earth
we hear songs: Praise to the Righteous One!" It no doubt seems natural
enough to understand the term tzaddı̄k (righteous) as referring to
Jehovah; but, as Hitzig observes, Jehovah is never called "the Righteous
One" in so absolute a manner as this (compare, however, [Psa
112:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004.md), where it occurs in connection
with other attributes, and [Exo 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027.md),
where it stands in an antithetical relation); and in addition to this,
Jehovah gives צבי ([Isa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md); [Isa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005).md), whilst כבוד, and not צבי, is
ascribed to Him. Hence we must take the word in the same sense as in
[Isa 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md) (cf., [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004).md). The reference is to the church
of righteous men, whose faith has endured the fire of the judgment of
wrath. In response to its summons to the praise of Jehovah, they answer
it in songs from the border of the earth. The earth is here thought of
as a garment spread out; cenaph is the point or edge of the garment, the
extreme eastern and western ends (compare [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012).md). Thence the church of the
future catches the sound of this grateful song as it is echoed from one
to the other.

The prophet feels himself, "in spirit," to be a member of this church;
but all at once he becomes aware of the sufferings which will have first
of all to be overcome, and which he cannot look upon without sharing the
suffering himself. "Then I said, Ruin to me! ruin to me! Woe to me!
Robbers rob, and robbing, they rob as robbers. Horror, and pit, and
snare, are over thee, O inhabitant of the earth! And it cometh to pass,
whoever fleeth from the tidings of horror falleth into the pit; and
whoever escapeth out of the pit is caught in the snare: for the
trap-doors on high are opened, and the firm foundations of the earth
shake. The earth rending, is rent asunder; the earth bursting, is burst
in pieces; the earth shaking, tottereth. The earth reeling, reeleth like
a drunken man, and swingeth like a hammock; and its burden of sin
presseth upon it; and it falleth, and riseth not again." The expression
"Then I said" (cf., [Isa 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005).md) stands
here in the same apocalyptic connection as in [Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014.md), for example. He said it at that
time in a state of ecstasy; so that when he committed to writing what he
had seen, the saying was a thing of the past. The final salvation
follows a final judgment; and looking back upon the latter, he bursts
out into the exclamation of pain: râzı̄-lı̄, consumption, passing away, to
me (see [Isa 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md); [Isa
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#004).md), i.e., I must perish (râzi is a
word of the same form as kâli, shâni, ‛âni; literally, it is a neuter
adjective signifying emaciatum = macies; Ewald, 749, g). He sees a
dreadful, bloodthirsty people preying among both men and stores (compare
[Isa 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002.md); [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md), for the play upon the word with
בגד, root גד, cf., κεύθειν τινά τι, tecte agere, i.e., from behind,
treacherously, like assassins). The exclamation, "Horror, and pit," etc.
(which Jeremiah applies in [Jer
48:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#043.md), to the destruction of Moab
by the Chaldeans), is not an invocation, but simply a deeply agitated
utterance of what is inevitable. In the pit and snare there is a
comparison implied of men to game, and of the enemy to sportsmen (cf.,
[Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016.md); [Lam
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#019.md); yillâcēr, as in [Isa
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#015.md); [Isa
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013).md). The על in עליך is exactly the
same as in [Jdg 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#009.md) (cf., [Isa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009).md). They who should flee as soon as
the horrible news arrived (min, as in [Isa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003).md) would not escape destruction,
but would become victims to one form if not to another (the same thought
which we find expressed twice in [Amo
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019.md), and still more fully in [Isa
9:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md), as well as in a more dreadfully
exalted tone). Observe, however, in how mysterious a background those
human instruments of punishment remain, who are suggested by the word
bōgdim (robbers). The idea that the judgment is a direct act of Jehovah,
stands in the foreground and governs the whole. For this reason it is
described as a repetition of the flood (for the opened windows or
trap-doors of the firmament, which let the great bodies of water above
them come down from on high upon the earth, point back to [Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md) and [Gen
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#002.md), cf., [Psa
78:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#023).md); and this indirectly implies
its universality. It is also described as an earthquake. "The
foundations of the earth" are the internal supports upon which the
visible crust of the earth rests. The way in which the earth in its
quaking first breaks, then bursts, and then falls, is painted for the
ear by the three reflective forms in [Isa
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#019.md), together with their gerundives,
which keep each stage in the process of the catastrophe vividly before
the mind. רעה is apparently an error of the pen for רע, if it is not
indeed a n. actionis instead of the inf. absol. as in [Hab
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#009.md). The accentuation, however,
regards the ah as a toneless addition, and the form therefore as a
gerundive (like kob in [Num 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#025).md).
The reflective form התרעע is not the hithpalel of רוּע, vociferari, but
the hithpoel of רעע (רצץ), frangere. The threefold play upon the words
would be tame, if the words themselves formed an anti-climax; but it is
really a climax ascendens. The earth first of all receives rents; then
gaping wide, it bursts asunder; and finally sways to and fro once more,
and falls. It is no longer possible for it to keep upright. Its
wickedness presses it down like a burden ([Isa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004.md); [Psa
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005).md), so that it now reels for the
last time like a drunken man ([Isa
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md); [Isa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009).md), or a hammock ([Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md), until it falls never to rise
again.

[Isaiah 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 24:21</span></span>

But if the old earth passes away in this manner out of the system of the
universe, the punishment of God must fall at the same time both upon the
princes of heaven and upon the princes of earth (the prophet does not
arrange what belongs to the end of all things in a "chronotactic"
manner). They are the secrets of two worlds, that are here unveiled to
the apocalyptic seer of the Old Testament. "And it cometh to pass in
that day, Jehovah will visit the army of the high place in the high
place, and the kings of the earth on the earth. And they are imprisoned,
as one imprisons captives in the pit, and shut up in prison; and in the
course of many days they are visited. And the moon blushes, and the sun
turns pale: for Jehovah of hosts reigns royally upon Mount Zion and in
Jerusalem, and before His elders is glory." With this doubly expressed
antithesis of mârōm and 'adâmâh (cf., [Isa
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017).md) before us, brought out as it is
as sharply as possible, we cannot understand "the army of the high
place" as referring to certain earthly powers (as the Targum, Luther,
Calvin, and Hvernick do). Moreover, the expression itself is also
opposed to such an interpretation; for, as [Isa
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018.md) clearly shows, in which mimmârom
is equivalent to misshâmaim (cf., [Isa
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#005.md); [Isa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023.md); [Isa
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026).md), מרום צבא is synonymous with
השּׁמים צבא; and this invariably signifies either the starry host ([Isa
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026).md) or the angelic host ([Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019.md); [Psa
148:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002).md), and occasionally the two
combined, without any distinction ([Neh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006).md). As the moon and sun are
mentioned, it might be supposed that by the "host on high" we are to
understand the angelic host, as Abravanel, Umbreit, and others really
do: "the stars, that have been made into idols, the shining kings of the
sky, fall from their altars, and the kings of the earth from their
thrones." But the very antithesis in the word "kings" (malchē) leads us
to conjecture that "the host on high" refers to personal powers; and the
view referred to founders on the more minute description of the
visitation (pâkad ‛al, as in [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md), [Isa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003.md), cf., [Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021).md), "they are imprisoned," etc.;
for this must also be referred to the heavenly host. The objection might
indeed be urged, that the imprisonment only relates to the kings, and
that the visitation of the heavenly host finds its full expression in
the shaming of the moon and sun ([Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023).md); but the fact that the moon and
sun are thrown into the shade by the revelation of the glory of Jehovah,
cannot be regarded as a judgment inflicted upon them. Hence the
commentators are now pretty well agreed, that "the host on high"
signifies here the angelic army. But it is self-evident, that a
visitation of the angelic army cannot be merely a relative and partial
one. And it is not sufficient to understand the passage as meaning the
wicked angels, to the exclusion of the good. Both the context and the
parallelism show that the reference must be to a penal visitation in the
spiritual world, which stands in the closest connection with the history
of man, and in fact with the history of the nations. Consequently the
host on high will refer to the angels of the nations and kingdoms; and
the prophecy here presupposes what is affirmed in [Deu
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008) (lxx.md), and sustained in the book
of Daniel, when it speaks of a sar of Persia, Javan, and even the people
of Israel. In accordance with this exposition, there is a rabbinical
saying, to the effect that "God never destroys a nation without having
first of all destroyed its prince," i.e., the angel who, by whatever
means he first obtained possession of the nation, whether by the will of
God or against His will, has exerted an ungodly influence upon it. Just
as, according to the scriptural view, both good and evil angels attach
themselves to particular men, and an elevated state of mind may
sometimes afford a glimpse of this encircling company and this conflict
of spirits; so do angels contend for the rule over nations and kingdoms,
either to guide them in the way of God or to lead them astray from God;
and therefore the judgment upon the nations which the prophet here
foretells will be a judgment upon angels also. The kingdom of spirits
has its own history running parallel to the destinies of men. What is
recorded in Gen 6 was a seduction of men by angels, and one of later
occurrence than the temptation by Satan in paradise; and the seduction
of nations and kingdoms by the host of heaven, which is here presupposed
by the prophecy of Isaiah, is later than either.

[Isaiah 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 24:22</span></span>

[Isa 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#022.md) announces the preliminary
punishment of both angelic and human princes: 'asēphâh stands in the
place of a gerundive, like taltēlâh in [Isa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#017.md). The connection of the words
'asēphâh 'assir is exactly the same as that of taltēlâh gâbēr in [Isa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#017.md) : incarceration after the manner
of incarcerating prisoners; 'âsaph, to gather together ([Isa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#014.md); [Isa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004).md), signifies here to incarcerate,
just as in [Gen 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#017.md). Both verbs are
construed with ‛al, because the thrusting is from above downwards, into
the pit and prison (‛al embraces both upon or over anything, and into
it, e.g., [Sa1 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#004.md); [Job
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#016.md); see Hitzig on [Nah
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#012).md). We may see from [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004.md) and [Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006.md) how this is to be understood. The
reference is to the abyss of Hades, where they are reserved in chains of
darkness unto the judgment of the great day. According to this parallel,
yippâkedu (shall be visited) ought apparently to be understood as
denoting a visitation in wrath (like [Isa
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md); [Eze
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#008.md); compare pâkad followed by an
accusative in [Isa 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021.md), also [Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md), and [Psa
59:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006.md); niphkad, in fact, is never used
to signify visitation in mercy), and therefore as referring to the
infliction of the final punishment. Hitzig, however, understands it as
relating to a visitation of mercy; and in this he is supported by Ewald,
Knobel, and Luzzatto. Gesenius, Umbreit, and others, take it to indicate
a citation or summons, though without any ground either in usage of
speech or actual custom. A comparison of [Isa
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017.md) in its relation to [Isa
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md)

(Note: Cf., Targ., Saad., "they will come into remembrance again.")

favours the second explanation, as being relatively the most correct;
but the expression is intentionally left ambiguous. So far as the thing
itself is concerned, we have a parallel in [Rev
20:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001.md) and [Rev
20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007.md) : they are visited by being set
free again, and commencing their old practice once more; but only (as
[Isa 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023) affirms.md) to lose again
directly, before the glorious and triumphant might of Jehovah, the power
they have temporarily reacquired. What the apocalyptist of the New
Testament describes in detail in [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004.md), [Rev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011.md)., and [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md), the apocalyptist of the Old
Testament sees here condensed into one fact, viz., the enthroning of
Jehovah and His people in a new Jerusalem, at which the silvery white
moon (lebânâh) turns red, and the glowing sun (chammâh) turns pale; the
two great lights of heaven becoming (according to a Jewish expression)
"like a lamp at noonday" in the presence of such glory. Of the many
parallels to [Isa 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md) which we meet
with in Isaiah, the most worthy of note are [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md) to the concluding clause, "and
before His elders is glory" (also [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005).md), and [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md) (cf., [Isa
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014).md), with reference to the use of
the word zekēnim (elders). Other parallels are [Isa
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md), for chammâh and lebânâh; [Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md), for châphēr and bōsh; [Isa
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022.md), for mâlak; [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md), for "Mount Zion and Jerusalem."
We have already spoken at [Isa 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md) of
the word neged (Arab. Ne'gd, from nâgad, njd, to be exalted; vid., opp.
Arab. gâr, to be pressed down, to sink), as applied to that which stands
out prominently and clearly before one's eyes. According to Hofmann
(Schriftbeweis, i. 320-1), the elders here, like the twenty-four
presbuteroi of the Apocalypse, are the sacred spirits, forming the
council of God, to which He makes known His will concerning the world,
before it is executed by His attendant spirits the angels. But as we
find counsellors promised to the Israel of the new Jerusalem in [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md), in contrast with the bad zekēnim
(elders) which it then possessed ([Isa
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014).md), such as it had at the glorious
commencement of its history; and as the passage before us says
essentially the same with regard to the zekēnim as we find in [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md) with regard to the festal meetings
of Israel (vid., [Isa 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#020.md) and [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001).md); and still further, as [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004.md) (cf., [Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028).md) is a more appropriate parallel
to the passage before us than [Rev
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md), we may assume with certainty, at
least with regard to this passage, and without needing to come to any
decision concerning [Rev 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md), that the
zekēnim here are not angels, but human elders after God's own heart.
These elders, being admitted into the immediate presence of God, and
reigning together with Him, have nothing but glory in front of them, and
they themselves reflect that glory.
