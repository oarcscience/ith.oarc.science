### [Psalms Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

Before Falling Asleep in the Wilderness

The Psalms that are to be sung after the melody אל־תּשׁחת ([Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md), [Psa
58:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001), 59 Davidic, 75 Asaphic.md) begin
here. The direction referring to the musical execution of the Psalm
ought properly to be אל־תשׁחת (אל); but this is avoided as being
unmelodious, and harsh so far as the syntax is concerned. The Geneva
version is correct: pour le chanter sur Al taschchet. There is no actual
reference in the words to [Deu 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#026.md),
or [Sa1 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#009.md) (why not also to [Isa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008)?.md).

The historical inscription runs: when he fled from Saul, in the cave.
From the connection in the history from which this statement is
extracted, it will have been clear whether the Psalm belongs to the
sojourn in the cave of Adullam (1 Sam. 22) or in the labyrinthine cave
upon the alpine heights of Engedi, "by the sheep-folds" (1 Sam. 24),
described in Van de Velde's Journey, ii. 74-76.

How manifold are the points in which these Psalms belonging to the time
of Saul run into one another! [Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md) has not merely the
supplicatory "Be gracious unto me, Elohim," at the beginning, but also
שׁאף applied in the same way ([Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md); [Psa
56:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#002)..md), in common with [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md); in common with Ps 7, כבודי =
נפשׁי ([Psa 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md); [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006).md); the comparison of one's enemies
to lions and lionesses ([Psa 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005.md);
[Psa 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003).md); the figure of the sword of
the tongue ([Psa 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005.md); [Psa
59:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#008.md), cf. [Psa
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#004).md); with [Psa
52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md) the poetical expression הוות
([Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md); [Psa
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#004).md); with Ps 22 the relation of the
deliverance of the anointed one to the redemption of all peoples ([Psa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010.md); [Psa
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#028)..md). Also with [Psa
36:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md) it has one or two points of
contact, viz., the expression "refuge under the shadow of God's wings"
([Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md), [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008).md), and in the measuring of the
mercy and truth of God by the height of the heavens ([Psa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011.md), [Psa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006).md). Yet, on the other hand, it has
a thoroughly characteristic impress. Just as [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md) delighted in confirming what
was said by means of the interrogatory הלא ([Psa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009), 14.md), so [Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md) revels in the figure
epizeuxis, or an emphatic repetition of a word ([Psa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md), [Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md), [Psa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md), [Psa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009).md). [Psa
108:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001) (which see.md) is a cento taken
out of [Psa 57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md) and [Psa
60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md).

The strophe-schema of [Psa 57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md) is
the growing one: 4. 5. 6; 4. 5. 6.

(Note: The Syriac version reckons only 29 στίχοι (fetgome); vid., the
Hexaplarian version of this Psalm taken from Cod. 14,434 (Add. MSS) in
the British Museum, in Heidenheim's Vierteljahrsschrift, No. 2 (1861).)

Here also the Michtam is not wanting in its prominent favourite word. A
refrain of a lofty character closes the first and second parts. In the
first part cheerful submission rules, in the second a certainty of
victory, which by anticipation takes up the song of praise.

[Psalms 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 57:1</span></span>

By means of the two distinctive tense-forms the poet describes his
believing flight to God for refuge as that which has once taken place
(חסיה from חסה = חסי out of pause, like the same forms in [Psa
73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002.md); [Psa
122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006).md), and still, because it is a
living fact, is ever, and now in particular, renewed (אחסה). The shadow
of the wings of God is the protection of His gentle, tender love; and
the shadow of the wings is the quickening, cordial solace that is
combined with this protection. Into this shadow the poet betakes himself
for refuge now as he has done before, until הוּות, i.e., the abysmal
danger that threatens him, be overpast, praeteriverit (cf. [Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md), and on the enallage numeri [Psa
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010), Ges. ֗147, a.md). Not as though he
would then no longer stand in need of the divine protection, but he now
feels himself to be specially in need of it; and therefore his chief aim
is an undaunted triumphant resistance of the impending trials. The
effort on his own part, however, by means of which he always anew takes
refuge in this shadow, is prayer to Him who dwells above and rules the
universe. עליון is without the article, which it never takes; and גּמר
([Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003).md) is the same, because it is
regularly left out before the participle, which admits of being more
fully defined, [Amo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md); [Eze
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#019) (Hitzig.md). He calls upon God who
accomplisheth concerning, i.e., for him ([Est
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016).md), who carrieth out his cause, the
cause of the persecuted one; גּמר is transitive as in [Psa
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008.md). The lxx renders τὸν
εὐεργετήσαντά με, as though it were גּמל עלי ([Psa
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#006), and frequently.md); and even Hitzig
and Hupfeld hold that the meaning is exactly the same. But although גמל
and גמר fall back upon one and the same radical notion, still it is just
their distinctive final letters that serve to indicate a difference of
signification that is strictly maintained. In [Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md) follow futures of hope. In this
instance "that which brings me deliverance" is to be supplied in thought
to ישׁלח (cf. [Psa 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003).md) and not ידו
as in [Psa 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017.md), cf. [Psa
144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md); and this general and
unmentioned object is then specialized and defined in the words "His
mercy and His truth" in [Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md).
Mercy and truth are as it were the two good spirits, which descending
from heaven to earth (cf. [Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003).md)
bring the divine ישׁוּעה to an accomplishment. The words חרף שׁאפי sdro
standing between a and c have been drawn by the accentuators to the
first half of the verse, they probably interpreting it thus: He (God)
reproacheth my devourers for ever (Sela). But חרף always (e.g., [Isa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023).md) has God as its object, not as
its subject. חרף שׁאפי is to be connected with what follows as a
hypothetical protasis (Ges. 155, 4, a): supposing that he who is greedy
or pants for me (inhians mihi) slandereth, then Elohim will send His
mercy and His truth. The music that becomes forte in between, introduces
and accompanies the throbbing confidence of the apodosis.

In [Psa 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005.md), on the contrary, we may
follow the interpretation of the text that is handed down and defined by
the accentuation, natural as it may also be, with Luther and others, to
take one's own course. Since לבאים (has Zarka (Zinnor) and להטים
Olewejored, it is accordingly to be rendered: "My soul is in the midst
of lions, I will (must) lie down with flaming ones; the children of men
- their teeth are a spear and arrows." The rendering of the lxx, of
Theodotion, and of the Syriac version accords with the interpunction of
our text so far as both begin a new clause with ἐκοιμήθην (ודמכת, and I
slept); whereas Aquila and Symmachus (taking נפשׁי, as it seems, as a
periphrastic expression of the subject-notion placed in advance) render
all as afar as להטים as one clause, at least dividing the verse into two
parts, just as the accentuators do, at להטים. The rendering of Aquila is
ἐν μέσῳ λεαινῶν κοιμηθήσομαι λάβρων; that of Symmachus: ἐν μέσῳ λεόντῶν
εὐθαρσῶν ἐκοιμήθην; or according to another reading, μεταξὺ λεόντων
ἐκοιμήθην φλεγόντων. They are followed by Jerome, who, however, in order
that he may be able to reproduce the נפשׁי, changes אשׁכבה into שׁכבה:
Anima mea in medio leonum dormivit ferocientium. This construction,
however, can be used in Greek and Latin, but not in Hebrew. We therefore
follow the accents even in reference to the Zarka above לבאים (a plural
form that only occurs in this one passage in the Psalter, = לביים). In a
general way it is to be observed that this לבאים in connection with
אשׁכּבה is not so much the accusative of the object as the accusative of
the place, although it may even be said to be the customary local
accusative of the object with verbs of dwelling; on שׁכב cf. [Rut
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#008.md), [Rut
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#014.md), and [Psa
88:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#006.md); [Mic
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#005.md) (where at least the possibility of
this construction of the verb is presupposed). But in particular it is
doubtful (1) what להטים signifies. The rendering "flaming ones" is
offered by the Targum, Saadia, and perhaps Symmachus. The verb להט
obtains this signification apparently from the fundamental notion of
licking or swallowing; and accordingly Theodotion renders it by
ἀναλισκόντων, and Aquila most appropriately by λάβρων (a word used of a
ravenous furious longing for anything). But להט nowhere means "to
devour;" the poet must, therefore, in connection with להטים, have been
thinking of the flaming look or the fiery jaws of the lions, and this
attributive will denote figuratively their strong desire, which snorts
forth as it were flames of fire. The question further arises, (2) how
the cohortative אשׁכבה is meant to be taken. Since the cohortative
sometimes expresses that which is to be done more by outward constraint
than inward impulse-never, however, without willing it one's self (Ew.
228, a) - the rendering "I must," or "therefore must I lie down,"
commends itself. But the contrast, which has been almost entirely
overlooked, between the literal beasts of prey and the children of men,
who are worse than these, requires the simple and most natural rendering
of the cohortative. We need only picture to ourselves the situation. The
verb שׁכב here has the sense of cubitum ire (Ps 4:9). Starting from this
אשׁכבה we look to [Psa 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md), and it at
once becomes clear that we have before us an evening or nightly song.
David the persecuted one finds himself in the wilderness and, if we
accept the testimony of the inscription, in a cave: his soul is in the
midst of lions, by which he means to say that his life is exposed to
them. Here bold in faith, he is resolved to lie down to sleep, feeling
himself more secure among lions than among men; for the children of men,
his deadly foes both in word and in deed, are worse than beasts of prey:
teeth and tongue are murderous weapons. This more than brutal joy at the
destruction of one's neighbour

(Note: Cf. Sir. 25:15, in the Hebrew: אין ראשׁ מעל ראשׁ פתן ואין חמה מעל
חמה אויב (no poison exceeds the poison of the serpent, and no wrath
exceeds the wrath of an enemy).)

which prevails among men, urges him to put forth the prayer that God,
who in Himself is exalted above the heavens and the whole earth, would
show Himself by some visible manifestation over the heavens above as the
exalted One, and the prayer that His glory may be, i.e., may become
manifest (or even: exalted be His glory, ירוּם), over the whole earth
beneath, - His glory which to His saints is a health-diffusing light,
and to the heartless foes of men and God a consuming fire, - so that the
whole world shall be compelled to acknowledge this glory in which His
holiness manifests itself, and shall become conformed to it after
everything that is hostile is overthrown.

[Psalms 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 57:6</span></span>

In this second half of the Psalm the poet refreshes himself with the
thought of seeing that for which he longs and prays realized even with
the dawning of the morning after this night of wretchedness. The perfect
in [Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md) is the perfect of
certainty; the other perfects state what preceded and is now changed
into the destruction of the crafty ones themselves. If the clause כּפף
נפשׁי is rendered: my soul was bowed down (cf. חלל, [Psa
109:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#022).md), it forms no appropriate
corollary to the crafty laying of snares. Hence kpp must be taken as
transitive: he had bowed down my soul; the change of number in the
mention of the enemies is very common in the Psalms relating to these
trials, whether it be that the poet has one enemy κατ ̓ ἐξοχήν before
his mind or comprehends them all in one. Even the lxx renders καὶ
κατέκαμψαν τὴν ψυχὴν μου, it is true, as though it were וכפפו, but can
scarcely have read it thus. This line is still remarkable; one would
expect for [Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md) a thought
parallel with [Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md), and perhaps
the poet wrote כפף נפשׁו, his (the net-layer's) own soul bends (viz., in
order to fall into the net). Then כפף like נפל would be praet.
confidentiae. In this certainty, to express which the music here becomes
triumphantly forte, David's heart is confident, cheerful (Symmachus
ἐδραία), and a powerful inward impulse urges him to song and harp.
Although נכון may signify ready, equipped ([Exo
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#002.md); [Job
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#005).md), yet this meaning is to be
rejected here in view of [Psa 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012.md),
[Psa 78:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#037.md), [Psa
112:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#007.md) : it is not appropriate to the
emphatic repetition of the word. His evening mood which found expression
in [Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md), was hope of victory; the
morning mood into which David here transports himself, is certainty of
victory. He calls upon his soul to awake (כּבודי as in [Psa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009); 30:13.md), he calls upon harp and
cithern to awake (הנּבל וכנּור with one article that avails for both
words, as in [Jer 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003.md); [Neh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#005.md); and עוּרה with the accent on the
ultima on account of the coming together of two aspirates), from which
he has not parted even though a fugitive; with the music of stringed
instruments and with song he will awake the not yet risen dawn, the sun
still slumbering in its chamber: אעירה, expergefaciam (not expergiscar),
as e.g., in [Sol 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007.md), and as Ovid
(Metam. xi. 597) says of the cock, evocat auroram.

(Note: With reference to the above passage in the Psalms, the Talmud, B.
Berachoth 3b, says, "A cithern used to hang above David's bed; and when
midnight came, the north wind blew among the strings, so that they
sounded of themselves; and forthwith he arose and busied himself with
the Tra until the pillar of the dawn (עמוד השׁחר) ascended." Rashi
observes, "The dawn awakes the other kings; but I, said David, will
awake the dawn (אני מעורר את השׁחר).")

His song of praise, however, shall not resound in a narrow space where
it is scarcely heard; he will step forth as the evangelist of his
deliverance and of his Deliverer in the world of nations (בעמּים; and
the parallel word, as also in [Psa
108:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#004.md); [Psa
149:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#007.md), is to be written בּלעמּים with
Lamed raphatum and Metheg before it); his vocation extends beyond
Israel, and the events of his life are to be for the benefit of mankind.
Here we perceive the self-consciousness of a comprehensive mission,
which accompanied David from the beginning to the end of his royal
career (vid., [Psa 18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050).md). What is
expressed in v. 11 is both motive and theme of the discourse among the
peoples, viz., God's mercy and truth which soar high as the heavens
([Psa 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006).md). That they extend even to
the heavens is only an earthly conception of their infinity (cf. [Eph
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018).md). In the refrain, v. 12, which
only differs in one letter from [Psa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006.md), the Psalm comes back to the
language of prayer. Heaven and earth have a mutually involved history,
and the blessed, glorious end of this history is the sunrise of the
divine doxa over both, here prayed for.
