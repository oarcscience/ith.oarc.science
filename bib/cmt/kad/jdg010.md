### [Judges Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md)

[Judges 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 10:1</span></span>

Of these two judges no particular deeds are mentioned, no doubt because
they performed none.

[Jdg 10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md)

Tola arose after Abimelech's death to deliver Israel, and judged Israel
twenty-three years until his death, though certainly not all the
Israelites of the twelve tribes, but only the northern and possibly also
the eastern tribes, to the exclusion of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, as
these southern tribes neither took part in Gideon's war of freedom nor
stood under Abimelech's rule. To explain the clause "there arose to
defend (or save) Israel," when nothing had been said about any fresh
oppression on the part of the foe, we need not assume, as Rosenmller
does, "that the Israelites had been constantly harassed by their
neighbours, who continued to suppress the liberty of the Israelites, and
from whose stratagems or power the Israelites were delivered by the acts
of Tola;" but Tola rose up as the deliverer of Israel, even supposing
that he simply regulated the affairs of the tribes who acknowledged him
as their supreme judge, and succeeded by his efforts in preventing the
nation from falling back into idolatry, and thus guarded Israel from any
fresh oppression on the part of hostile nations. Tola was the son of
Puah, the son of Dodo, of the tribe of Issachar. The names Tola and Puah
are already met with among the descendants of Issachar, as founders of
families of the tribes of Issachar (see [Gen
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#013.md); [Num
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#023.md), where the latter name is
written פּוּה), and they were afterwards repeated in the different
households of these families. Dodo is not an appellative, as the Sept.
translators supposed (υἱὸς πατραδέλφου αὐτοῦ), but a proper name, as in
[Sa2 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#009) (Keri.md), 24, and [Ch1
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#012.md). The town of Shamir, upon the
mountains of Ephraim, where Tola judged Israel, and was afterwards
buried, was a different place from the Shamir upon the mountains of
Judah, mentioned in [Jos 15:48](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048.md), and
its situation (probably in the territory of Issachar) is still unknown.

[Jdg 10:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#003.md)

After him Jair the Gileadite (born in Gilead) judged Israel for
twenty-two years. Nothing further is related of him than that he had
thirty sons who rode upon thirty asses, which was a sign of
distinguished rank in those times when the Israelites had no horses.
They had thirty cities (the second עירים in [Jdg
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004.md) is another form for ערים, from a
singular עיר = עיר, a city, and is chosen because of its similarity in
sound to עירים, asses). These cities they were accustomed to call
Havvoth-jair unto this day (the time when our book was written), in the
land of Gilead. The להם before יקראוּ is placed first for the sake of
emphasis, "even these they call," etc. This statement is not at variance
with the fact, that in the time of Moses the Manassite Jair gave the
name of Havvoth-jair to the towns of Bashan which had been conquered by
him ([Num 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md); [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014).md); for it is not affirmed here,
that the thirty cities which belonged to the sons of Jair received this
name for the first time from the judge Jair, but simply that this name
was brought into use again by the sons of Jair, and was applied to these
cities in a peculiar sense. (For further remarks on the Havvoth-jair,
see at [Deu 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014)..md) The situation of
Camon, where Jair was buried, is altogether uncertain. Josephus (Ant. v.
6, 6) calls it a city of Gilead, though probably only on account of the
assumption, that it would not be likely that Jair the Gileadite, who
possessed so many cities in Gilead, should be buried outside Gilead. But
this assumption is a very questionable one. As Jair judged Israel after
Tola the Issacharite, the assumption is a more natural one, that he
lived in Canaan proper. Yet Reland (Pal. ill. p. 679) supports the
opinion that it was in Gilead, and adduces the fact that Polybius (Hist.
v. 70, 12) mentions a town called Καμοῦν, by the side of Pella and
Gefrun, as having been taken by Antiochus. On the other hand, Eusebius
and Jerome (in the Onom.) regard our Camon as being the same as the κώμη
Καμμωνὰ ἐν τῷ μεγάΛῳ πεδίῳ, six Roman miles to the north of Legio
(Lejun), on the way to Ptolemais, which would be in the plain of Jezreel
or Esdraelon. This is no doubt applicable to the Κυαμών of Judith 7:3;
but whether it also applies to our Camon cannot be decided, as the town
is not mentioned again.

[Judges 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 10:6</span></span>

The third stage in the period of the judges, which extended from the
death of Jair to the rise of Samuel as a prophet, was a time of deep
humiliation for Israel, since the Lord gave up His people into the hands
of two hostile nations at the same time, on account of their repeated
return to idolatry; so that the Ammonites invaded the land from the
east, and oppressed the Israelites severely for eighteen years,
especially the tribes to the east of the Jordan; whilst the Philistines
came from the west, and extended their dominion over the tribes on this
side, and brought them more and more firmly under their yoke. It is true
that Jephthah delivered his people from the oppression of the Ammonites,
in the power of the Spirit of Jehovah, having first of all secured the
help of God through a vow, and not only smote the Ammonites, but
completely subdued them before the Israelites. But the Philistine
oppression lasted forty years; for although Samson inflicted heavy blows
upon the Philistines again and again, and made them feel the superior
power of the God of Israel, he was nevertheless not in condition to
destroy their power and rule over Israel. This was left for Samuel to
accomplish, after he had converted the people to the Lord their God.

Israel's Renewed Apostasy and Consequent Punishment - [Jdg
10:6-18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md)

As the Israelites forsook the Lord their God again, and served the gods
of the surrounding nations, the Lord gave them up to the power of the
Philistines and Ammonites, and left them to groan for eighteen years
under the severe oppression of the Ammonites, till they cried to Him in
their distress, and He sent them deliverance through Jephthah, though
not till He had first of all charged them with their sins, and they had
put away the strange gods. This section forms the introduction, not only
to the history of Jephthah (Judg 11:1-12:7) and the judges who followed
him, viz., Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon ([Jdg
12:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008).md), but also to the history of
Samson, who began to deliver Israel out of the power of the Philistines
(Judg 13-16). After the fact has been mentioned in the introduction (in
[Jdg 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007).md), that Israel was given up
into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites at the same time,
the Ammonitish oppression, which lasted eighteen years, is more
particularly described in [Jdg 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#008.md),
[Jdg 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#009.md). This is followed by the
reproof of the idolatrous Israelites on the part of God ([Jdg
10:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010).md); and lastly, the history of
Jephthah is introduced in [Jdg 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md),
[Jdg 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#018.md), the fuller account being
given in Judg 11. Jephthah, who judged Israel for six years after the
conquest and humiliation of the Ammonites ([Jdg
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#007).md), was followed by the judges
Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon, who judged Israel for seven, ten, and eight
years respectively, that is to say, for twenty-five years in all; so
that Abdon died forty-nine years (18 + 6 + 25) after the commencement of
the Ammonitish oppression, i.e., nine years after the termination of the
forty years' rule of the Philistines over Israel, which is described
more particularly in [Jdg 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001.md), for
the purpose of introducing the history of Samson, who judged Israel
twenty years under that rule ([Jdg
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#020.md); [Jdg
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#031).md), without bringing it to a
close, or even surviving it. It was only terminated by the victory which
Israel achieved under Samuel at Ebenezer, as described in 1 Sam 7.

[Jdg 10:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md)

In the account of the renewed apostasy of the Israelites from the Lord
contained in [Jdg 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md), seven heathen
deities are mentioned as being served by the Israelites: viz., in
addition to the Canaanitish Baals and Astartes (see at [Jdg
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md), [Jdg
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013).md), the gods of Aram, i.e., Syria,
who are never mentioned by name; of Sidon, i.e., according to [Kg1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md), principally the Sidonian or
Phoenician Astarte; of the Moabites, i.e., Chemosh ([Kg1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033).md), the principal deity of that
people, which was related to Moloch (see at [Num
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029).md); of the Ammonites, i.e., Milcom
([Kg1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md), [Kg1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033).md) (see at [Jdg
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#023).md). If we compare the list of
these seven deities with [Jdg 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011.md)
and [Jdg 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012.md), where we find seven
nations mentioned out of whose hands Jehovah had delivered Israel, the
correspondence between the number seven in these two cases and the
significant use of the number are unmistakeable. Israel had balanced the
number of divine deliverances by a similar number of idols which it
served, so that the measure of the nation's iniquity was filled up in
the same proportion as the measure of the delivering grace of God. The
number seven is employed in the Scriptures as the stamp of the works of
God, or of the perfection created, or to be created, by God on the one
hand, and of the actions of men in their relation to God on the other.
The foundation for this was the creation of the world in seven days. -
On [Jdg 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007.md), see [Jdg
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013.md). The Ammonites are mentioned
after the Philistines, not because they did not oppress the Israelites
till afterwards, but for purely formal reasons, viz., because the
historian was about to describe the oppression of the Ammonites first.
In [Jdg 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#008.md), the subject is the
"children of Ammon," as we may see very clearly from [Jdg
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#009). "They (the Ammonites.md) ground and
crushed the Israelites in the same year," i.e., the year in which God
sold the Israelites into their hands, or in which they invaded the land
of Israel. רעץ and רצץ are synonymous, and are simply joined together
for the sake of emphasis, whilst the latter calls to mind [Deu
28:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033.md). The duration of this oppression
is then added: "Eighteen years (they crushed) all the Israelites, who
dwelt on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites,"
i.e., of the two Amoritish kings Sihon and Og, who (dwelt) in Gilead.
Gilead, being a more precise epithet for the land of the Amorites, is
used here in a wider sense to denote the whole of the country on the
east of the Jordan, so far as it had been taken from the Amorites and
occupied by the Israelites (as in [Num
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#029.md); [Deu
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md) : see at [Jos
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#009).md).

[Jdg 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#009.md)

They also crossed the Jordan, and made war even upon Judah, Benjamin,
and the house of Ephraim (the families of the tribe of Ephraim), by
which Israel was brought into great distress. ותּצר, as in [Jdg
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#015.md).

[Jdg 10:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010.md)

When the Israelites cried in their distress to the Lord, "We have sinned
against Thee, namely, that we have forsaken our God and served the
Baals," the Lord first of all reminded them of the manifestations of His
grace ([Jdg 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011.md), [Jdg
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012).md), and then pointed out to them
their faithless apostasy and the worthlessness of their idols ([Jdg
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#013.md), [Jdg
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#014).md). וכי, "and indeed that,"
describes the sin more minutely, and there is no necessity to remove it
from the text-an act which is neither warranted by its absence from
several MSS nor by its omission from the Sept., the Syriac, and the
Vulgate. Baalim is a general term used to denote all the false gods, as
in [Jdg 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md). This answer on the part
of God to the prayer of the Israelites for help is not to be regarded as
having been given through an extraordinary manifestation (theophany), or
through the medium of a prophet, for that would certainly have been
recorded; but it was evidently given in front of the tabernacle, where
the people had called upon the Lord, and either came through the high
priest, or else through an inward voice in which God spoke to the hearts
of the people, i.e., through the voice of their own consciences, by
which God recalled to their memories and impressed upon their hearts
first of all His own gracious acts, and then their faithless apostasy.
There is an anakolouthon in the words of God. The construction which is
commenced with ממּצרים is dropped at וגו וצידונים in [Jdg
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012.md); and the verb הושׁעתּי, which
answers to the beginning of the clause, is brought up afterwards in the
form of an apodosis with אתכם ואושׁיעה. "Did I not deliver you (1) from
the Egyptians (cf. Ex 1-14); (2) from the Amorites (cf. [Num
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#003)); (3.md) from the Ammonites (who
oppressed Israel along with the Moabites in the time of Ehud, [Jdg
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012).); (4.md) from the Philistines
(through Shamgar: see [Sa1 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#009.md), where
the Philistines are mentioned between Sisera and Moab); (5) from the
Sidonians (among whom probably the northern Canaanites under Jabin are
included, as Sidon, according to [Jdg
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md), [Jdg
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#028.md), appears to have exercised a
kind of principality or protectorate over the northern tribes of
Canaan); (6) from the Amalekites (who attacked the Israelites even at
Horeb, [Exo 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md)., and afterwards
invaded the land of Israel both with the Moabites, [Jdg
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md), and also with the Midianites,
[Jdg 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003)); and (7.md) from the
Midianites?" (see Judg 6-7). The last is the reading of the lxx in Cod.
Al. and Vat., viz., Μαδιάμ; whereas Ald. and Compl. read Χαναάν, also
the Vulgate. In the Masoretic text, on the other hand, we have Maon.
Were this the original and true reading, we might perhaps think of the
Mehunim, who are mentioned in [Ch2
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007.md) along with Philistines and
Arabians (cf. [Ch1 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041).md), and are
supposed to have been inhabitants of the city of Maan on the Syrian
pilgrim road to the east of Petra (Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 734 and 1035:
see Ewald, Gesch. i. pp. 321, 322). But there is very little probability
in this supposition, as we cannot possibly see how so small a people
could have oppressed Israel so grievously at that time, that the
deliverance from their oppression could be mentioned here; whilst it
would be very strange that nothing should be said about the terrible
oppression of the Midianites and the wonderful deliverance from that
oppression effected by Gideon. Consequently the Septuagint (Μαδιάμ)
appears to have preserve the original text.

[Jdg 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#013.md)

Instead of thanking the Lord, however, for these deliverances by
manifesting true devotedness to Him, Israel had forsaken Him and served
other gods (see [Jdg 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013).md).

[Jdg 10:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#014.md)

Therefore the Lord would not save them any more. They might get help
from the gods whom they had chosen for themselves. The Israelites should
now experience what Moses had foretold in his song ([Deu
32:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037).md). This divine threat had its
proper effect. The Israelites confessed their sins, submitted thoroughly
to the chastisement of God, and simply prayed for salvation; nor did
they content themselves with merely promising, they put away the strange
gods and served Jehovah, i.e., they devoted themselves again with
sincerity to His service, and so were seriously converted to the living
God. "Then was His (Jehovah's) soul impatient (תּקצר, as in [Num
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004).md) because of the troubles of
Israel;" i.e., Jehovah could no longer look down upon the misery of
Israel; He was obliged to help. The change in the purpose of God does
not imply any changeableness in the divine nature; it simply concerns
the attitude of God towards His people, or the manifestation of the
divine love to man. In order to bend the sinner at all, the love of God
must withdraw its helping hand and make men feel the consequences of
their sin and rebelliousness, that they may forsake their evil ways and
turn to the Lord their God. When this end has been attained, the same
divine love manifests itself as pitying and helping grace. Punishments
and benefits flow from the love of God, and have for their object the
happiness and well-being of men.

[Jdg 10:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md)

These verses form the introduction to the account of the help and
deliverance sent by God, and describe the preparation made by Israel to
fight against its oppressors. The Ammonites "let themselves be called
together," i.e., assembled together (הצּעק, as in [Jdg
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#023).md), and encamped in Gilead, i.e.,
in that portion of Gilead of which they had taken possession. For the
Israelites, i.e., the tribes to the east of the Jordan (according to
[Jdg 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#018.md) and [Jdg
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029).md), also assembled together in
Gilead and encamped at mizpeh, i.e., Ramath-mizpeh or Ramoth in Gilead
([Jos 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026.md); [Jos
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008).md), probably on the site of the
present Szalt (see at [Deu 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043.md), and
the remarks in the Commentary on the Pentateuch, pp. 180f.), and
resolved to look round for a man who could begin the war, and to make
him the head over all the inhabitants of Gilead (the tribes of Israel
dwelling in Perea). The "princes of Gilead" are in apposition to "the
people." "The people, namely, the princes of Gilead," i.e., the heads of
tribes and families of the Israelites to the east of the Jordan. "Head"
is still further defined in [Jdg 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#006.md),
[Jdg 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011.md), as "captain," or "head and
captain."
