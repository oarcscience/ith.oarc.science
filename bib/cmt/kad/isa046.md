### [Isaiah Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 46:1</span></span>

There follows now a trilogy of prophecies referring to Babylon. After
the prophet has shown what Israel has to expect of Cyrus, he turns to
what awaits Babylon at the hands of Cyrus. "Bel sinketh down, Nebo
stoopeth; its images come to the beast of burden and draught cattle:
your litters are laden, a burden for the panting. They stopped, sank
down all at once, and could not get rid of the burden; and their own
self went into captivity." The reference to Babylon comes out at once in
the names of the gods. Bēl was the Jupiter of the Babylonians and, as
Bel-Merodach, the tutelar deity of Babylon; Nebo was Mercury, the
tutelar deity of the later Chaldean royal family, as the many kings'
names in which it appears clearly show (e.g., Mabonassar, Nabo-polassar,
etc.). The pryamidal heap of ruins on the right bank of the Euphrates,
which is now called Birs Nimrud, is the ruin of the temple of Bel, of
which Herodotus gives a description in i. 181-183, and probably also of
the tower mentioned in Gen 11, which was dedicated to Bel, if not to El
= Saturn. Herodotus describes two golden statues of Bel which were found
there (cf., Diodorus, ii. 9, 5), but the way in which Nebo was
represented is still unknown. The judgment of Jehovah falls upon these
gods through Cyrus. Bel suddenly falls headlong, and Nebo stoops till he
also falls. Their images come to (fall to the lot of) the chayyâh, i.e.,
the camels, dromedaries, and elephants; and behēmâh, i.e., horses, oxen,
and asses. Your נשׂאת, gestamina, the prophet exclaims to the
Babylonians, i.e., the images hitherto carried by you in solemn
procession ([Isa 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020.md); [Amo
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md); [Jer
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005).md), are now packed up, a burden for
that which is wearied out, i.e., for cattle that has become weary with
carrying them. In [Isa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md), as the
two participial clauses show, the prophet still takes his stand in the
midst of the catastrophe; but in [Isa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002.md) it undoubtedly lies behind him as
a completed act. In [Isa 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002.md) he
continues, as in [Isa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md), to enter
into the delusion of the heathen, and distinguish between the numina and
simulacra. The gods of Babylon have all stooped at once, have sunken
down, and have been unable to save their images which were packed upon
the cattle, out of the hands of the conquerors. In [Isa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002.md) he destroys this delusion: they
are going into captivity ([Hos 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md);
[Jer 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md); [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003).md), even "their ownself"
(naphshâm), since the self or personality of the beingless beings
consists of nothing more than the wood and metal of which their images
are composed.

[Isaiah 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 46:3</span></span>

From this approaching reduction of the gods of Babylon to their original
nothingness, several admonitions are now derived. The first admonition
is addressed to all Israel. "Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all
the remnant of the house of Israel: ye, lifted up from the womb; ye,
carried from the mother's lap! And till old age it is I, and to grey
hair I shall bear you on my shoulder: I have done it, and I shall carry;
and I put upon my shoulder, and deliver. To whom can ye compare me, and
liken, and place side by side, that we should be equal?" The house of
Jacob is Judah here, as in [Oba 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#018.md)
(see Caspari on the passage), [Nah
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#003.md), and the house of Israel the same
as the house of Joseph in Obadiah; whereas in [Amo
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#013.md); [Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008.md); [Amo
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#002.md), Jacob stands for Israel, in
distinction from Judah. The Assyrian exile was earlier than the
Babylonian, and had already naturalized the greater part of the exiles
in a heathen land, and robbed them of their natural character, so that
there was only a remnant left by whom there was any hope that the
prophet's message would be received. What the exiles of both houses were
to hear was the question in [Isa 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#005.md),
which called upon them to consider the incomparable nature of their God,
as deduced from what Jehovah could say of Himself in relation to all
Israel, and what He does say from העמסים onwards. Babylon carried its
idols, but all in vain: they were carried forth, without being able to
save themselves; but Jehovah carried His people, and saved them. The
expressions, "from the womb, and from the mother's lap," point back to
the time when the nation which had been in process of formation from the
time of Abraham onwards came out of Egypt, and was born, as it were,
into the light of the world. From this time forward it had lain upon
Jehovah like a willingly adopted burden, and He had carried it as a
nurse carries a suckling ([Num 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012).md),
and an eagle its young ([Deu 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011).md).
In [Isa 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004.md) the attributes of the
people are carried on in direct (not relative) self-assertions on the
part of Jehovah. The senectus and canities are obviously those of the
people - not, however, as though it was already in a state of dotage (as
Hitzig maintains, appealing erroneously to [Isa
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006).md), but as denoting the future and
latest periods of its history. Even till then Jehovah is He, i.e., the
Absolute, and always the same (see [Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004).md). As He has acted in the past, so
will He act at all times - supporting and saving His people. Hence He
could properly ask, Whom could you place by the side of me, so that we
should be equal? (Vav consec. as in [Isa
40:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#025).md).

[Isaiah 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 46:6</span></span>

The negative answer to this question is the direct result of what
precedes, but a still further proof is given in [Isa
46:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#006.md), [Isa
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007.md). "They who pour gold out of the
bag, and weigh silver with the balance, hire a goldsmith to make it into
a god, that they may fall down, yea, throw themselves down. They lift it
up, carry it away upon their shoulder, and set it down in its place:
there it stands; from its place it does not move: men also cry to it,
but it does not answer; it saves no one out of distress." There is no
necessity for assuming that הזּלים is used in the place of the finite
verb, as Hitzig imagines, or as equivalent to זלים הם, as Rosenmller and
Gesenius suppose; but up to ישׂכּרוּ the whole is subject, and therefore
ישׁקלוּ is the point at which the change into the finite verb occurs
(Ges. 131, 2). The point in hazzâlı̄m is not the extravagant expenditure,
as Ewald thinks, but the mean origin of the god, which commences with
the pouring out of gold from a purse (zūl = zâlal, to shake, to pour
out). Qâneh is the lever of the scales (κανών). The metal weighed out is
given to a goldsmith, who plates the idol with the gold, and makes the
ornaments for it of silver. When it is finished, they lift it up, or
shoulder it (ישּׂאהוּ with a distinctive Great Telisha), carry it home,
and set it down in the place which it is to have under it (תּחתּיו).
There it stands firm, immoveable, and also deaf and dumb, hearing no
one, answering no one, and helping no one. The subject to יצעק is any
צעק. The first admonition closes here. The gods who are carried fall
without being able to save themselves, whereas Israel's God carries and
saves His people; He, the Incomparable, more especially in contrast with
the lifeless puppets of idols.

[Isaiah 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 46:8</span></span>

The second admonition is addressed to those who would imitate the
heathen. "Remember this, and become firm, take it to heart, ye
rebellious ones! Remember the beginning from the olden time, that I am
God, and none else: Deity, and absolutely none like me: proclaiming the
issue from the beginning, and from ancient times what has not yet taken
place, saying, My counsel shall stand, and all my good pleasure I carry
out: calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a
distant land: not only have I spoken, I also bring it; I have purposed
it, I also execute it." The object to which "this" points back is the
nothingness of idols and idolatry. The persons addressed are the פושׁעים
(those apostatizing), but, as התאשׁשׁוּ shows, whether it mean
ἀνδιρίζεσθε or κραταιοῦσθε ([Co1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013).md), such as have not yet actually
carried out their rebellion or apostasy, but waver between Jehovahism
and heathenism, and are inclined to the latter. התאשׁשׁו is hardly a
denom. hithpalel of אישׁ in the sense of "man yourselves," since אישׁ,
whether it signifies a husband or a social being, or like אנושׁ, a frail
or mortal being, is at any rate equivalent to אנשׁ, and therefore never
shows the modification u. אשׁשׁ (אשׁה) signifies to be firm, strong,
compact; in the piel (rabb.), to be well-grounded; nithpael, to be
fortified, established; here hithpoel, "show yourselves firm" (Targ.,
Jer.: fundamini ne rursum subitus idololatriae vos turbo subvertat).
That they may strengthen themselves in faith and fidelity, they are
referred to the history of their nation; ראשׁנות are not prophecies
given at an earlier time - a meaning which the priora only acquire in
such a connection as [Isa 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md) - but
former occurrences. They are to pass before their minds the earlier
history, and indeed "from the olden time." "Remember:" zikhrū is
connected with the accusative of the object of remembrance, and כּי
points to its result. An earnest and thoughtful study of history would
show them that Jehovah alone was El, the absolutely Mighty One, and
'Elōhı̄m, the Being who united in Himself all divine majesty by which
reverence was evoked. The participles in [Isa
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010.md), [Isa
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011.md) are attached to the "I" of
כּמוני. It is Jehovah, the Incomparable, who has now, as at other times
from the very commencement of the new turn in history, predicted the
issue of which it would lead, and miqqedem, i.e., long before, predicted
things that have not yet occurred, and which therefore lit outside the
sphere of human combination - another passage like [Isa
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026.md); [Isa
45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021.md), etc., in which what is
predicted in these prophecies lays claim to the character of a
prediction of long standing, and not of one merely uttered a few years
before. The ראשׁית, in which the ראשׁנות are already in progress ([Isa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009).md), is to be regarded as the
prophet's ideal present; for Jehovah not only foretells before the
appearance of Cyrus what is to be expected of him, but declares that His
determination must be realized, that He will bring to pass everything
upon which His will is set, and summons the man upon the stage of
history as the instrument of its accomplishment, so that He knew Cyrus
before he himself had either consciousness or being ([Isa
45:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004).md). The east is Persis ([Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002).md); and the distant land, the
northern part of Media (as in [Isa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005).md). Cyrus is called an eagle, or,
strictly speaking, a bird of prey (‛ayit),

(Note: The resemblance to ἀετός (αἰετός) is merely accidental. This name
for the eagle is traceable, like avid, to a root vâ, to move with the
swiftness of the wind. This was shown by Passow, compare Kuhn's
Zeitschrift, i. 29, where we also find at 10, 126 another but less
probable derivation from a root i, to go (compare eva, a course).)

just as in [Jer 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022.md) and [Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md) Nebuchadnezzar is called a
nesher. According to Cyrop. vii. 1, 4, the campaign of Cyrus was ἀετὸς
χρυσοῦς ἐπὶ δόρατος μακροῦ ἀνατεταμένος. Instead of עצתו אישׁ, the keri
reads more clearly, though quite unnecessarily, (עצתי אישׁ (see e.g.,
[Isa 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026).md). The correlate אף ([Isa
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011).md), which is only attached to the
second verb the second time, affirms that Jehovah does not only the one,
but the other also. His word is made by Him into a deed, His idea into a
reality. יצר is a word used particularly by Isaiah, to denote the ideal
preformation of the future in the mind of God (cf., [Isa
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011.md); [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026).md). The feminine suffixes refer in
a neuter sense to the theme of the prophecy - the overthrow of
idolatrous Babel, upon which Cyrus comes down like an eagle, in the
strength of Jehovah. So far we have the nota bene for those who are
inclined to apostasy. They are to lay to heart the nothingness of the
heathen gods, and, on the other hand, the self-manifestation of Jehovah
from the olden time, that is to say, of the One God who is now
foretelling and carrying out the destruction of the imperial city
through the eagle from the east.

[Isaiah 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 46:12</span></span>

A third admonition is addressed to the forts esprits in [Isa
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#012.md), [Isa
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013.md). "Hearken to me, ye
strong-hearted, that are far from righteousness! I have brought my
righteousness near; it is not far off, and my salvation tarrieth not:
and I give salvation in Zion, my glory to Israel." All that is called in
Hellenic and Hellenistic νοῦς λόγος συνείδησις θυμός, is comprehended in
καρδία; and everything by which bâsâr and nephesh are affected comes
into the light of consciousness in the heart (Psychol. p. 251).
According to this biblico-psychological idea, לב אבּיתי may signify
either the courageous ([Psa 76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006).md), or,
as in this instance, the strong-minded; but as a synonym of לב סהזקי
([Eze 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#004).md) and לב קשׁי ([Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007).md), viz., in the sense of those who
resist the impressions of the work and grace of God in their
consciousness of mental superiority to anything of the kind, and not in
the sense of those who have great mental endowments. These are "far from
righteousness" (tsedâqâh), that is to say, they have despaired of the
true, loving fidelity of Jehovah, and have no wish for any further
knowledge of it. Therefore they shall hear, and possibly not without
impression, that this loving fidelity is about to manifest itself, and
salvation is about to be realized. Jehovah has given salvation in Zion,
that is to say, is giving it even now, so that it will become once more
the centre of the renovated nation, and impart its glory to this, so
that it may shine in the splendour bestowed upon it by its God. We have
here the side of light and love, turned towards us by the two-faced
tsedâqâh, as a parallel word to theshū‛âh, or salvation. With this
admonition to the indifferent and careless, to whom the salvation of
which they have given up all hope is proclaimed as at the door, this
prophecy is brought to a close. In three distinct stages, commencing
with "hearken," "remember," "hearken," it has unfolded the spiritual
influences which the fact declared in [Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md), [Isa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002.md) ought to have upon Israel, and
resembles a pastoral sermon in its tone.
