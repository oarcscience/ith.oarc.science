The Example of the Rechabites

By the command of God, Jeremiah brings the family of the Rechabites (who
had fled for refuge to Jerusalem before the approach of the Chaldeans)
into one of the chambers of the temple, and sets before them some wine
to drink ([Jer 35:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001).md). They decline
to drink, because the head of their family had forbidden them the use of
wine, as well as the possession of houses and the cultivation of the
soil, and had commanded them to live in tents ([Jer
35:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#006).md). Jeremiah is to put this
before the people of Judah. The Rechabites faithfully observe the
command of their ancestor, while the people of Judah transgress the
commands of their God, which are continually presented to them ([Jer
35:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#012).md). Therefore the threatened
calamity shall fall upon Judah; but the house of Rechab, as a reward for
their faithfulness to the injunctions of their ancestor, shall continue
for ever ([Jer 35:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#017).md).

According to [Jer 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001.md), this word of
the Lord came to Jeremiah in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim,
and, according to [Jer 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011.md), previous
to the arrival of Nebuchadnezzar and his host before Jerusalem;
therefore perhaps in the summer of the year 606 b.c., for Jerusalem was
taken for the first time by Nebuchadnezzar in the ninth month (December)
of that year.

[Jeremiah 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001.md)

Jeremiah's dealings with the Rechabites - [Jer
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#002.md). Jeremiah is to go to the house,
i.e., the family, of the Rechabites, speak with them, and bring them
into tone of the chambers of the temple, and set before them wine to
drink. בּית , [Jer 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#002.md), [Jer
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#003.md), [Jer
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#018.md), is exchanged for בּני
בית־הרכבים, [Jer 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#005.md), from which it
is apparent that "the house of the Rechabites" does not mean their
dwelling-place, but the family, called in [Ch1
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055.md) בּית־רכב. According to this
passage, the Rechabites were a branch of the Kenites, i.e., descendants
of the Kenite, the father-in-law of Moses ([Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016).md), who had gone to Canaan with the
Israelites, and welt among them, partly in the wilderness on the
southern frontier of the tribe of Judah ([Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md); [Sa1
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010.md); [Sa1
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#029).md), partly at Kadesh in Naphtali
([Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md), [Jdg
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017.md); [Jdg
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024).md). Their ancestor, or father of
the tribe, was Rechab, the father of Jonadab, with whom Jehu made a
friendly alliance ([Kg2 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015.md), [Kg2
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#023).md). Jonadab had laid on them the
obligation to live in the special manner mentioned below, in order to
keep them in the simplicity of nomad life observed by their fathers, and
to preserve them from the corrupting influences connected with a settled
life. לשׁכות, "cells of the temple," were additional buildings in the
temple fore-courts, used partly for keeping the stores of the temple
([Ch1 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012).md), partly as dwellings for
those who served in it, and as places of meeting for those who came to
visit it; see [Eze 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017.md).

[Jer 35:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#003.md)

In executing the command of the Lord, Jeremiah took (went for)
Jaazaniah, son of Jeremiah, son of Habaziniah, and all his brethren, and
sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites, and brought them into the
temple-chamber of the sons of Hanan. Jaazaniah was probably the then
chief of the Rechabites. The chamber of the sons of Hanan was situated
next the princes' chamber, which stood over that of Maaseiah the
door-keeper. Nothing further is known about Hanan the son of Jigdaliah;
here he is called "the man of God," an honourable title of the prophets
- see e.g., [Kg1 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#022.md) - for,
according to the usual mode of construction, אישׁ האלהים does not belong
to Jigdaliah, but to Hanan, cf. [Jer
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md); [Zac
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md). "The chamber of the princes" is
the chamber where the princes, the chiefs of the people, used to
assemble in the temple. Its position is more exactly described by ממּעל
לל, "over the chamber of Maaseiah," but not very clearly for us, since
the buildings of the temple fore-courts are nowhere else more exactly
described; however, see on [Jer 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010.md).
Maaseiah was שׁמר הסּף, "keeper of the threshold," i.e., overseer of the
watchmen of the temple gates, of which, according to [Jer
52:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024.md) and [Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md), there were three, who are there
mentioned along with the high priest and his substitute Maaseiah is
probably the same whose son Zephaniah was כּהן המּשׁנה , cf. [Jer
52:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024.md) with [Jer
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003.md); [Jer
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025.md), and [Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md).

[Jer 35:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#005.md)

There, Jeremiah caused bowls filled with wine to be set before the
Rechabites, and commanded them to drink. (גּביעים are large goblets,
bowls, out of which drinking-cups \[כּסות\] were filled.) But they
explained that they did not drink wine, because their father, i.e.,
their ancestor, Jonadab had forbidden them and their posterity to drink
wine for ever, as also to build houses, to sow seed, and to plant
vineyards, i.e., to settle themselves down in permanent dwellings and to
pursue agriculture. ולא יהיה לכם, "And there shall not be to you," sc.
what has just been named, i.e., ye must not possess houses,
growing-crops, or vineyards (cf. [Jer
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#009).md),

(Note: These injunctions, given by Jonadab to his posterity, that he
might make them always lead a nomad life, are quoted by Diodorus
Siculus, xix. 94, as a law among the Nabateans: Νόμος ἐστὶν αὐτοῖς μήτε
σίτον σπείρειν, μήτε φυτεύειν μηδὲν φυτὸν καρποφόρον, μήτε οἴνῳ χρῆσθαι,
μήτε οἰκίαν κατασεκυάζειν; while the object of the law is stated to have
been the maintenance of their freedom against the more powerful who
sought to bring them into subjection. And even at the present day the
Bedouins imagine that they are prevented, by the nobility of their
descent from Ishmael, from engaging in agriculture, handicraft, or the
arts; cf. Arvieux, Sitten der Beduinen-Araber, 5f.)

but ye are to dwell in tents all your life, that ye may live long, etc.
This promise is an imitation of that found in [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md).

[Jer 35:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#008.md)

This command of their forefather they observe in all points, and
therefore dwell in tents; and only because of Nebuchadnezzar's arrival
in the country have they come to Jerusalem, in order to find refuge for
a time from the army of the Chaldeans and that of Aram (the Arameans).
The special mention of the army of Aram in connection with that of the
Chaldeans is perhaps due to the frequent predatory incursions made, at
an earlier period, on Israel and Judah by the Syrians. According to [Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002.md), after Jehoiakim had rebelled
against Nebuchadnezzar, hostile bands of Arameans invaded Judah for the
purpose of laying waste the country.

[Jeremiah 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 35:12</span></span>

The example of the Rechabites is one for Judah. - Jeremiah is to
proclaim the word of the Lord to the people of Judah, as follows: [Jer
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#013.md). "Thus saith Jahveh of hosts,
the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction by listening to my words?
saith Jahveh. [Jer 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#014.md). The words of
Jonadab the son of Rechab, who commanded this sons not to drink wine,
are performed, and they have drunk no wine to this day, but have obeyed
the command of their father. But I have spoken unto you, rising up early
and speaking, yet ye have not listened unto me. [Jer
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015.md). And I sent unto you all my
servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Turn ye,
now, every one from his evil way, and do good deeds, and do not go after
other gods, to serve them; then shall ye dwell in the land which I have
given to you and to your fathers. But ye did not incline your ear, nor
hearken unto me. [Jer 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#016.md). Yea, the
children of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the commandment of
their father which he commanded them, while this people have not
hearkened unto me. [Jer 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#017.md).
Therefore, thus saith Jahveh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel:
Behold, I will bring upon Judah and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem all
the evil which I have uttered regarding them, because I spake unto them
and they did not hear, and I called unto them, but they did not answer.
[Jer 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#018.md). And to the house of the
Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel,
Because ye have listened to the command of Jonadab your father, and have
kept all his commandments, and have done according to all that he
commanded you, [Jer 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019.md). Therefore,
thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab
shall not want a man to stand before me for ever."

The command, "Go and speak to the men of Judah," etc., shows that it was
not in the chamber of the temple, in presence of the Rechabites, but
probably in one of the temple fore-courts, that Jeremiah addressed the
following word of the Lord to the people assembled there. In order to
shame the Jews thoroughly, he shows them the faithfulness with which the
Rechabites observe the ordinances of their ancestor Jonadab. The
character of the address, as one intended to rouse feelings of shame, is
indicated even at the beginning of [Jer
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#013.md) : "Will ye not receive
instruction by hearkening to the words of the Lord?" The Hoph. הוּקם is
construed as a passive with the accus.; in the older writers we
frequently find this construction, in which the passive is used
impersonally, hence the sing. is here employed: cf. Ges. 143, 1, Ew.
295, b. "To this day" - now for nearly 300 years without interruption;
for Jonadab was already held in high esteem when Jehu ascended the
throne, 883 b.c. ([Kg2 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015).md). Judah,
on the contrary, does not listen to the commandments which his God
unceasingly inculcates on him, but rather wanders after other gods, to
serve them. On [Jer 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015.md) cf. [Jer
25:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#004.md). אל־האדמה stands for על־האדמה ,
[Jer 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#005.md). - In [Jer
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#016.md), where the introductory כּי,
imo, indicates a culmination, the idea is once more briefly expressed.
Ngelsbach incorrectly renders כּי "because," and makes [Jer
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#016.md) the protasis to [Jer
35:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#017.md). "Such a protasis with because
(quia), without any connection with what precedes, is contrary to the
use of language" (Hitzig). On the threat of punishment in [Jer
35:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#017.md), see [Jer
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011.md).

[Jeremiah 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 35:18</span></span>

The declaration concerning the Rechabites is introduced by the formula,
"And to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said;" thereby, too, it is
shown that the statement does not form an integral portion of the
preceding address, but was uttered by Jeremiah perhaps at the close of
his transactions with them ([Jer
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011).md). But it is not given till now,
in order to signify to the people of Judah that even fidelity to
paternal commands has its own rewards, to make the threat uttered
against Judah all the more impressive. On the promise [Jer
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019.md), cf. [Jer
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#018.md). Since עמד denotes the standing
of a servant before his master, and in [Jer
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010.md) is used of the appearance of the
people before the Lord in the temple, עמד לפני seems here also to
express not merely the permanence of the family, but in addition, their
continuance in the service of the Lord, without, of course, involving
sacerdotal service; cf. on the other hand, [Jer
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#018.md), where this service is more
exactly described. The acknowledgment of the Lord on the part of the
Rechabites is a necessary result of their connection with Israel.

(Note: According to the account of the Jewish missionary Wolff, there
are still some Rechabites in Asia, in Mesopotamia and Yemen, who affirm
that they are descended from Hobab the brother-in-law \[A.V.
"father-in-law;" but see Smith's Bible Dictionary, vol. i. Hobab\] of
Moses. Wolff points out that part of the desert of Yemen near Senaa as
the special locality where these Rechabites live. Cf. Dr. Joseph Wolff,
ein Wanderleben, von Dr. Sengelmann, Hamburg 1863, S. 65 u 196.)
