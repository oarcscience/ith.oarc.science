### [Proverbs Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 27:1</span></span>

In the group [Pro 27:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001.md) of this
chapter every two proverbs form a pair. The first pair is directed
against unseemly boasting:

1 Boast not thyself of to-morrow,

For thou knowest not what a day bringeth forth.

The ב of בּיום is like, e.g., that in [Pro
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#014.md), the ב of the ground of
boasting. One boasts of to-morrow when he boasts of that which he will
then do and experience. This boasting is foolish and presumptuous ([Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020).md), for the future is God's; not a
moment of the future is in our own power, we know not what a day, this
present day or to-morrow ([Jam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013).md),
will bring forth, i.e., (cf. [Zep 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#002).md)
will disclose, and cannot therefore order anything beforehand regarding
it. Instead of לא־תדע (with Kametz and Mugrash), אל־תדע (thus e.g., the
Cod. Jaman) is to be written; the Masora knows nothing of that pausal
form. And instead of מה־יּלד יום, we write מה יּלד יום with Zinnorith.
יּלד before יום has the tone thrown back on the penult., and
consequently a shortened ult.; the Masora reckons this word among the
twenty-five words with only one Tsere.

[Proverbs 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 27:2</span></span>

2 Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth;

A stranger, and not thine own lips.

The negative לא is with פיך, as in (Arab.) ghyra fyk, bound into one
compact idea: that which is not thine own mouth (Fleischer), "not thine
own lips," on the other hand, is not to be interpreted as corresponding
to it, like אל־מות, [Pro 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028.md); since
after the prohibitive אל, יהללוּך \[praise thee\] easily supplies
itself. זר is properly the stranger, as having come from a distance, and
נכרי he who comes from an unknown country, and is himself unknown (vid.,
under [Pro 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#024).md); the idea of both
words, however, passes from advena and alienigena to alius. There is
certainly in rare cases a praising of oneself, which is authorized
because it is demanded ([Co2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#018).md),
which, because it is offered strongly against one's will, will be
measured by truth ([Pro 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013).md); but in
general it is improper to applaud oneself, because it is a vain looking
at oneself in a glass; it is indecent, because it places others in the
shade; imprudent, because it is of no use to us, but only injures, for
propria laus sordet, and as Stobus says, οὐδὲν οὕτως ἄκουσμα φορτικὸν ὡς
καθ ̓ αὑτοῦ ἔταινος. Compare the German proverb, "Eigenlob stinkt,
Freundes Lob hinkt, fremdes Lob klingt" \[= self-praise stinks, a
friend's praise is lame, a stranger's praise sounds\].

[Proverbs 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 27:3</span></span>

The second pair of proverbs designates two kinds of violent passion as
unbearable:

3 The heaviness of a stone, the weight of sand -

A fool's wrath is heavier than both.

We do not translate: Gravis est petra et onerosa arena, so that the
substantives stand for strengthening the idea, instead of the
corresponding adjective (Fleischer, as the lxx, Jerome, Syr., Targum);
the two pairs of words stand, as 4a, in genit. relation (cf. on the
contrary, [Pro 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#030).md), and it is as if
the poet said: represent to thyself the heaviness of a stone and the
weight of sand, and thou shalt find that the wrath of a fool compared
thereto is still heavier, viz., for him who has to bear it; thus
heavier, not for the fool himself (Hitzig, Zckler, Dchsel), but for
others against whom his anger goes forth. A Jewish proverb (vid.,
Tendlau, No. 901) says, that one knows a man by his wine-glass (כוס),
his purse (כיס), and his anger (כעס), viz., how he deports himself in
the tumult; and another says that one reads what is in a man ביום כעסו,
when he is in an ill-humour. Thus also כעס is to be here understood: the
fool in a state of angry, wrathful excitement is so far not master of
himself that the worst is to be feared; he sulks and shows hatred, and
rages without being appeased; no one can calculate what he may attempt,
his behaviour is unendurable. Sand, חול,

(Note: Sand is called by the name חוּל (חיל), to change, whirl,
particularly to form sand-wreaths, whence (Arab.) al-Habil, the region
of moving sand; vid., Wetzstein's Nord-arabien, p. 56.)

as it appears, as to the number of its grains innumerable, so as to its
mass (in weight) immeasurable, [Job
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#003.md); Sir. 22:13. נטל the Venet.
translates, with strict regard to the etymology, by ἅρμα.

[Proverbs 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 27:4</span></span>

4 The madness of anger, and the overflowing of wrath -

And before jealousy who keeps his place!

Here also the two pairs of words 4a stand in connection; אכזריּוּת (for
which the Cod. Jaman has incorrectly אכזריות) is the connecting form;
vid., regarding אכזרי, [Pro 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009.md). Let
one imagine the blind, relentless rage of extreme excitement and
irritation, a boiling over of anger like a water-flood, which bears
everything down along with it - these paroxysms of wrath do not usually
continue long, and it is possible to appease them; but jealousy is a
passion that not only rages, but reckons calmly; it incessantly ferments
through the mind, and when it breaks forth, he perishes irretrievably
who is its object. Fleischer generalizes this idea: "enmity proceeding
from hatred, envy, or jealousy, it is difficult or altogether impossible
to withstand, since it puts into operation all means, both secretly and
openly, to injure the enemy." But after [Pro
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#034.md)., cf. [Sol
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md), there is particularly meant the
passion of scorned, mortified, deceived love, viz., in the relation of
husband and wife.

[Proverbs 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 27:5</span></span>

The third pair of proverbs passes over from this special love between
husband and wife to that subsisting between friends:

5 Better is open accusation

Than secret love.

An integral distich; meeאהבה has Munach, and instead of the second
Metheg Tarcha, after Thorath Emeth, p. 11. Zckler, with Hitzig,
incorrectly: better than love which, from false indulgence, keeps
concealed from his neighbour his faults, when he ought to tell him of
them. That would require the phrase אהבה מסתּרת, not מסתּרת. Dchsel, in
order to accommodate the text to this meaning, remarks: concealed
censure is concealed love; but it is much rather the neglected duty of
love - love without mutual discipline is weak, faint-hearted, and, if it
is not too blind to remark in a friend what is worthy of blame, is
altogether too forbearing, and essentially without conscience; but it is
not "hidden and concealed love." The meaning of the proverb is
different: it is better to be courageously and sternly corrected - on
account of some fault committed - by any one, whether he be a foe or a
friend, than to be the object of a love which may exist indeed in the
heart, but which fails to make itself manifest in outward act. There are
men who continually assure us of the reality and depth of their
friendship; but when it is necessary for them to prove their love to be
self-denying and generous, they are like a torrent which is dry when one
expects to drink water from it ([Job
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015).md). Such "secret" love, or, since
the word is not נסתּרת, but מסתּרת, love confined to the heart alone, is
like a fire which, when it burns secretly, neither lightens nor warms;
and before such a friend, any one who frankly and freely tells the truth
has by far the preference, for although he may pain us, yet he does us
good; while the former deceives us, for he leaves us in the lurch when
it is necessary to love us, not merely in word and with the tongue, but
in deed and in truth ([Jo1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018).md).
Rightly Fleischer: Praestat correptio aperta amicitiae tectae, i.e.,
nulla re probatae.

[Proverbs 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 27:6</span></span>

6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend,

And overloaded \[plentiful\] the kisses of an enemy.

The contrast to נאמנים, true, i.e., honourable and good (with the
transference of the character of the person to his act), would be
fraudulenta (Jerome), or נהפכות, i.e., false (Ralbag); Ewald seeks this
idea from עתר, to stumble, make a false step;

(Note: Thus also Schultens in the Animadversiones, which later he
fancied was derived from עתר, nidor, from the meaning nidorosa, and
thence virulenta.)

Hitzig, from עתר = (Arab.) dadhr, whence dâdhir, perfidus, to gain from;
but (1) the comparison does not lie near, since usually the Arab. t
corresponds to the Heb. שׁ, and the Arab. d to the Heb. ז; (2) the Heb.
עתר has already three meanings, and it is not advisable to load it with
yet another meaning assumed for this passage, and elsewhere not found.
The three meanings are the following: (a) to smoke, Aram. עטר, whence
עתר, vapour, [Eze 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011.md), according to
which the Venet., with Kimchi's and Parchon's Lex., translates: the
kisses of an enemy συνωμίχλωνται, i.e., are fog; (b) to sacrifice, to
worship, Arab. atar; according to which Aquila: ἱκετικά (as, with Grabe,
it is probably to be read for ἑκούσια of the lxx); and agreeably to the
Niph., but too artificially, Arama: obtained by entreaties =
constrained; (c) to heap up, whence Hiph. העתיר, [Eze
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#013.md), cf. [Jer
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006.md), according to which Rashi, Meri,
Gesenius, Fleischer, Bertheau, and most explain, cogn. with עשׁר, whose
Aram. form is עתר, for עשׁר is properly a heap of goods or treasures.

(Note: Vid., regarding this word, Schlottmann in Deutsch.-Morgenl.
Zeitschrift, xxiv. 665, 668.)

This third meaning gives to the kisses of an enemy a natural adjective:
they are too abundant, so much the more plentiful to veil over the
hatred, like the kisses by means of which Judas betrayed his Lord, not
merely denoted by φιλεῖν, but by καταφιλεῖν, [Mat
26:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049.md). This, then, is the contrast,
that the strokes inflicted by one who truly loves us, although they tear
into our flesh (פּצע, from פּצע, to split, to tear open), yet are
faithful (cf. [Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005).md); on the
contrary, the enemy covers over with kisses him to whom he wishes all
evil. Thus also נעתרות forms an indirect contrast to נאמנים.

[Proverbs 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 27:7</span></span>

In [Pro 27:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#007.md) there is also visible
a weaving of the external with the internal. First, there are two
proverbs, in each of which there is repeated a word terminating with נ.

7 A satisfied soul treadeth honeycomb under foot;

And a hungry soul - everything bitter is (to it) sweet.

It is unnecessary to read תּבוּז (Hitzig); תּבוּס is stronger; "to tread
with the feet" is the extreme degree of scornful despite. That satiety
and hunger are applicable to the soul, vid., under [Pro
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003.md). In 7b, the adverb להּ, relative
to the nomin. absol., like [Pro 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#007.md),
but not [Pro 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#018.md). "Hunger is the
best cook," according to a German proverb; the Hebrew proverb is so
formed that it is easily transferred to the sphere of the soul. Let the
man whom God has richly satisfied with good things guard himself against
ingratitude towards the Giver, and against an undervaluing of the gifts
received; and if they are spiritual blessings, let him guard himself
against self-satisfaction and self-contentment, which is, in truth, the
worst poverty, [Rev 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md); for life
without God is a constant hunger and thirst. There is in worldly things,
even the most pleasing, a dissatisfaction felt, and a dissatisfaction
awakening disgust; and in spiritual life, a satiety which supposes
itself to be full of life, but which is nothing else than the decay of
life, than the changing of life into death.

[Proverbs 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 27:8</span></span>

8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest,

So is a man that wandereth from his home.

It is not a flying out that is meant, from which at any moment a return
is possible, but an unwilling taking to flight (lxx 8b: ὅταν ἀποξενωθῇ;
Venet.: πλανούμενον ... πλανούμενος); for עוף נודד, [Isa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#002.md), cf. [Jer
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#025.md), birds that have been frightened;
and נדד, [Pro 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#015.md)., designates the
fugitive; cf. נע ונד, [Gen 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#014.md), and
above, [Pro 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002.md), where נוּד
designates aimless roving about. Otherwise Fleischer: "warning against
unnecessary roaming about, in journeyings and wanderings far from home:
as a bird far from its nest is easily wounded, caught, or killed, so, on
such excursions, one easily comes to injury and want. One may think of a
journey in the East. The Arabs say, in one of their proverbs: âlsafar
ḳaṭ'at man âlklyym (= journeying is a part of the pains of hell)." But
נדד here is not to be understood in the sense of a libere vagari.
Rightly C. B. Michaelis: qui vagatur extorris et exul a loco suo sc.
natali vel habitationis ordinariae. This proverb mediately recommends
the love of one's fatherland, i.e., "love to the land in which our
father has his home; on which our paternal mansion stands; in which we
have spent the years of our childhood, so significant a part of one's
whole life; from which we have derived our bodily and intellectual
nourishment; and in which home we recognise bone of our bone and flesh
of our flesh."

(Note: Gustave Baur's article "Vaterlandsliebe," in Schmid's
Pdagogischer Encyklopdie.)

But next it says, that to be in a strange land must be an unhappiness,
because a man never feels better than at home, as the bird in its nest.
We say: Heimat \[home\] - this beautiful word becomes the German
language, which has also coined the expressive idea of Heimweh \[longing
for home\]; the Heb. uses, to express the idea of home, the word מקומי;
and of fatherland, the word ארצי or אדמתי. The Heb. שׁבוּת corresponds

(Note: The translators transfer to this place a note from vol. ii. p.
191f. of the author's larger Comm. . den Psalter, to which Delitzsch
refers the reader: - "The modern High German adj. elend, middle High
German ellende, old High German alilandi, elilendi, or elilenti, is
composed of ali and land. The adj. ali occurs only in old High German in
composition. In the Gothic it is found as an independent adj., in the
sense of alius and ἄλλυς (vid., Ulfilas, [Gal
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010).md). The primary meaning of elilenti
is consequently: of another country, foreign. In glosses and
translations it is rendered by the Lat. words peregrinus, exul, advena,
also captivus. In these meanings it occurs very frequently. In the old
High German translation of Ammonius, Diatessaron, sive Harmoniae in
quatuor Evangelica, the word proselytism, occurring in [Mat
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#015.md), is rendered by elilantan. To
the adj. the old High German subst. corresponds. This has the meaning
exilium, transmigratio, captivitas. The connection in elilenti or
elilentes, used adverbially, is rendered by the Lat. peregre. In the
middle High German, however, the proper signification of both words
greatly predominates. But as, in the old High German, the idea of miser
is often at the same time comprehended in the proper signification: he
who is miserable through banishment, imprisonment, or through sojourning
in a strange land; thus, in several places of the middle High German,
this derived idea begins to separate itself from the fundamental
conception, so that ellende comes in general to be called miser. In the
new High German this derived conception is almost alone maintained. Yet
here also, in certain connections, there are found traces of the
original idea, e.g., in's Elend schicken, for to banish. Very early also
the word came to be used, in a spiritual sense, to denote our present
abode, in contrast to paradise or the heavenly kingdom.... Thus, e.g.,
in one of Luther's hymns, when we pray to the Holy Ghost:

Das er vns behte, an vnserm ende,

Wenn wir heim farn aus diesem elende."

\[That He guard us to our end

When we go home from this world.\]

\- Rud. von Raumer)

to the German Elend, but = Ellend, elilenti, of another land, strange.

[Proverbs 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 27:9</span></span>

The two following proverbs have in common the catchword רע, and treat of
the value of friendship: -

9 Oil and frankincense rejoice the heart;

And the sweet discourse of a friend from a counselling of soul.

Regarding the perfuming with dry aromas, and sprinkling with liquid
aromas, as a mark of honour towards guests, and as a means of promoting
joyful social fellowship, vid., at [Pro
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016.md)., [Pro
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#017.md). The pred. ישׂמּח comprehends
frankincense or oil as the two sides of one and the same thing; the lxx
introduces, from [Psa 104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md), also
wine. It also reads ומתק רעה as one word, וּמתקרעת: καταῤῥήγνυται δὲ ὑπὸ
συμπτωμάτων ψυχή, which Hitzig regards as original; for he translates,
understanding מעצת after [Psa 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003.md),
"but the soul is torn by cares." But why מתקרעה, this Hithpa. without
example, for נקרעה? and now connected with מן in the sense of ὑπό! And
what does one gain by this Alexandrian wisdom \[of the lxx\] - a
contrast to 9a which is altogether incongruous? Dderlein's rendering
accords far better with 9a: "but the sweetness of a friend surpasses
fragrant wood." But although this rendering of the word \[עצה\] by
"fragrant wood" is found in Gesen. Lex., from one edition to another,
yet it must be rejected; for the word signifies wood as the contents of
trees, the word for aromatic wood must be עצים; and if the poet had not
intentionally aimed at dubiety, he ought to have written עצי בשׂם, since
נפשׁ, which the exception of [Isa
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020.md), where it is beyond doubt,
nowhere means fragrance. If we read עצת and נפשׁ together, then we may
suppose that the latter designates the soul, as at [Psa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003.md); and the former, counsel (from
the verb יעץ). But to what does the suffix of רעהוּ refer? One may
almost conjecture that the words originally were וּמתק נפשׁ מעצת רעהוּ,
and the sweetness of the soul (i.e., a sweet relish for it, cf. [Pro
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#007.md) and [Pro
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#024).md) consists in the counsel of a
friend, according to which Jerome translates: et bonis amici conciliis
anima dulcoratur. By this transposition רעהו refers back to נפשׁ; for is
nephesh denote a person or a living being, it can be construed ad sensum
as masc., e.g., [Num 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#028.md). But the
words may remain in the order in which they are transmitted to us. It is
possible that רעהוּ is (Bttcher refers to [Job
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004).md) of the same meaning as הרע (the
friend of one = the friend), as כלּו denotes directly the whole; חציו,
the half; עתּו, the right time. Recognising this, Cocceius, Umbreit,
Stier, and Zckler explain: sweetness, i.e., the sweet encouragement
(מתק, in the sense of "sweetness (grace) of the lips," [Pro
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#021).md) of a friend, is better than
one's own counsel, than prudence seeking to help oneself, and trusting
merely to one's own resources; thus also Rashi: better than what one's
own soul advises him. But (1) נפשׁ cannot mean one's own person
(oneself) in contrast to another person; and (2) this does not supply a
correct antithesis to 9a. Thus מן will not express the preference, but
the origin. Accordingly Ewald, e.g., explains: the sweetness of a friend
whom one has proceedeth from the counsel of soul, i.e., from such
counsel as is drawn from a deep, full soul. But no proof can be brought
from the usage of the language that עצת־נפשׁ can be so meant; these
words, after the analogy of דעת נפשׁ, [Pro
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002.md), mean ability to give counsel as
a quality of the soul ([Pro 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#014.md); [Pro
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013).md), i.e., its ability to advise.
Accordingly, with Bertheau, we explain ישׂמח־לב as the common predicate
for 9a and 9b: ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, and (The Syr.,
Targ., well: even so) the sweet exhortation of a friend, from a soul
capable of rendering counsel; also, this and this, more than that
fragrance. This proverb is formed in the same way as [Pro
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#009.md), [Pro
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#014.md). In this explanation רעהו is
well referred back to לב: and (more than) the sweet advice of his
friend. But not so that רעהו is equivalent to רע הלּב, for one does not
thus speak; but the construction is as when we say, in the German
language: Nichts thut einem Herzen woler als wenn sein Freund es
mitfhlend trstet \[nothing does more good to a heart than when a friend
sympathizingly comforts it\]; or: Zage nicht, tief betrbtes Herz! Dein
Freund lebt und wird dir bald sich zeigen \[Be not dismayed,
deeply-troubled heart! thy friend lives, and will soon show himself to
thee\]. In such cases the word "Herz" \[heart\] does not designate a
distinct part of the person, but, synecdochically, it denotes the whole
person.

[Proverbs 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 27:10</span></span>

Another proverb, consisting of three lines, in commendation of
friendship:

Thine own friend and the friend of thy father forsake not,

And into thy brother's house go not in the day of thy misfortune -

Better is a near neighbour than a far-off brother.

In our editions רעך is incorrectly appointed with Pasek after it, so
that the accent is Asla Legarmeh; the Pasek is, after the example of
older editions, with Norzi, to be cancelled, so that only the
conjunctive Asla remains; "thine own and the friend of thy father"
denotes the family friend, like some family heirloom, descending from
father to son. Such an old tried friend one must certainly not give up.
The Kerı̂ changes the second ורעה into ורע, but ורעה (which, after the
Masora in st. constr., retains its segol, Ewald, 211e) is also
admissible, for a form of comparison (Hitzig) this רעה is not, but the
fuller form of the abbreviated רע, from רעה, to take care of, to tend,
to pasture - an infinitive formation (= רעי) like the Arab. cogn. râ'in
a participial. Such a proved friend one ought certainly not to give up,
and in the time of heavy trial (vid., regarding איד, [Pro
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026).md) one should go to him and not to
a brother's house - it is by this supposed that, as [Pro
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024.md) says, there is a degree of
friendship (cf. [Pro 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017).md) which in
regard to attachment stands above that of mere fraternal relationship,
and it is true; blood-relationship, viewed in itself, stands as a
relationship of affection on natural grounds below friendship, which is
a relationship of life on moral grounds. But does blood-relationship
exclude friendship of soul? cannot my brother be at the same time my
heart-friend? and is not friendship all the firmer when it has at the
same time its roots in the spirit and in natural grounds? The poet seems
to have said this, for in 10c, probably a popular saying (cf. "Besser
Nachbar an der Wand als Bruder ber Land" \[Better a neighbour by one's
side than a brother abroad\]), he gives to his advice a foundation, and
at the same time a limitation which modifies its ruggedness. But Dchsel
places (like Schultens) in קרוב and רחוק meanings which the words do not
contain, for he interprets them of inward nearness and remoteness; and
Zckler reads between the lines, for he remarks, a "near neighbour" is
one who is near to the oppressed to counsel and help them, and a
"distant brother" is one who with an unamiable disposition remains far
from the oppressed. The state of the matter is simple. If one has a
tried friend in neighbourly nearness, so in the time of distress, when
he needs consolation and help, he must go to this friend, and not first
to the house of a brother dwelling at a distance, for the former
certainly does for us what the latter probably may and probably may not
do for us.

[Proverbs 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 27:11</span></span>

This proverb has, in common with the preceding tristich, the form of an
address:

Become wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice,

That I may give an answer to my accusers.

Better than "be wise" (Luther), we translate "become wise" (lxx σοφὸς
γίνου); for he who is addressed might indeed be wise, though not at
present so, so that his father is made to listen to such deeply wounding
words as these, "Cursed be he who begat, and who educated this man"
(Malbim). The cohortative clause 11b (cf. [Psa
119:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#042).md) has the force of a clause with
a purpose (Gesen. 128:1): ut habeam quod iis qui me convicientur
regerere possim; it does not occur anywhere in the Hezekiah collection
except here.

[Proverbs 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 27:12</span></span>

ערום appears to lean on חכם.

The prudent man seeth the misfortune, hideth himself;

The simple pass on, suffer injury.

= [Pro 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003.md), where וּפתיים for פּתאים,
ונסתּר for נסתּר, and ונענשׁוּ for נענשׁוּ; the three asyndeta make the
proverb clumsy, as if it counted out its seven words separately to the
hearer. Ewald, 349a, calls it a "Steinschrift" an inscription on a
stone. The perfects united in pairs with, and yet more without, Vav,
express the coincidence

(Note: The second Munach is at [Pro
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003.md), as well as here, according to
the rule [Pro 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#004.md) of the
Accentuationssystem, the transformation of the Dechi, and preserves its
value of interpunction; the Legarmeh of ערום is, however, a disjunctive
of less force than Dechi, so that thus the sequence of the accents
denotes that ערום ראה רעה is a clause related to ונסתר as a hypothetical
antecedent: if the prudent sees the calamity, then he hides himself from
it. This syntactic relation is tenable at [Pro
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003.md), but not here at [Pro
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#012.md). Here, at least, ערום would be
better with Rebia, to which the following Dechi would subordinate
itself. The prudent seeth the evil, concealeth himself; or also, prudent
is he who sees the evil, hides himself. For of two disjunctives before
Athnach, the first, according as it is greater or less than the second,
retains either Legarmeh (e.g., [Psa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md); [Psa
86:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#012.md); [Psa
88:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#014.md); [Psa
109:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#014).md) or Rebia ([Pro
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002.md), [Psa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md); [Psa

as to time.

[Proverbs 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 27:13</span></span>

ערום alliterates with ערב.

Take from him the garment, for he hath become surety for another,

And for the sake of a strange matter put him under bonds.

= [Pro 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#016.md), vid., there. נכריּה we
interpret neut. (lxx τὰ ἀλλότρια; Jerome, pro alienis), although
certainly the case occurs that one becomes surety for a strange woman
(Aquila, Theodotion, περὶ ξένης), by whose enticements and flatteries he
is taken, and who afterwards leaves him in the lurch with the debts for
which he had become security, to show her costly favour to another.

[Proverbs 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 27:14</span></span>

This proverb, passing over the three immediately intervening, connects
itself with [Pro 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#009.md) and [Pro
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#010.md). It is directed against
cringing, noisy complimenting:

He who blesseth his neighbour with a loud voice, rising early in the
morning,

It is reckoned as a curse to him.

The first line is intentionally very heavy, in order to portray the
empressement of the maker of compliments: he calls out to another his
good wishes with a loud voice, so as to make the impression of deep
veneration, of deeply felt thankfulness, but in reality to gain favour
thereby, and to commend himself to greater acts of kindness; he sets
himself to meet him, having risen up (השׁכּים, adverbial inf. abs.; cf.
[Jer 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#004.md) with [Jer
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#004).md) early in the morning, to offer
his captatio benevolentiae as speedily as possible; but this salutation
of good wishes, the affected zeal in presenting which is a sign of a
selfish, calculating, servile soul, is reckoned to him as קללה, viz.,
before God and every one who can judge correctly of human nature, also
before him who is complimented in so ostentatious and troublesome a
manner, the true design of which is thus seen. Others understand the
proverb after the example of Berachoth 14a, that one ought to salute no
one till he has said his morning's prayer, because honour is due before
all to God (the Book of Wisdom, 10:28); and others after Erachin 16a,
according to which one is meant who was invited as a guest of a generous
lord, and was liberally entertained, and who now on the public streets
blesses him, i.e., praises him for his nobility of mind - such blessing
is a curse to him whom it concerns, because this trumpeting of his
praise brings upon him a troublesome, importunate crowd. But plainly the
particularity of 'בּקול וגו lays the chief emphasis on the servility
manifested; and one calls to mind the case of the clients besieging the
doors of their patrons, those clientes matutini, each of whom sought to
be the first in the salutatio of his distinguished wealthy patron.

[Proverbs 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 27:15</span></span>

This proverb passes from the complimentarius to its opposite, a shrewish
wife:

A continual dropping in a rainy day

And a contentious woman are alike.

Thus we have already translated (vol. i. p. 9), where, when treating of
the manifold forms of parabolic proverbs, we began with this least
poetic, but at the same time remarked that [Pro
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015.md) and [Pro
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#016.md) are connected, forming a
tetrastich, which is certainly the case according to the text here lying
before us. In [Pro 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015.md), [Pro
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013.md) is expanded into a distich, and
made a complete verse. Regarding דּלף טורד, vid., the explanation there
given. The noun סגריר, which the Syr. translates by magyaa', but the
Targumist retains, because it is in common use in the post-bibl. Heb.
(Bereschith rabba, c. 1) and the Jewish Aramaic, signifies violent rain,
after the Jewish interpreters, because then the people remain shut up in
their houses; more correctly, perhaps, from the unbroken continuousness
and thickness (cf. the Arab. insajara, to go behind each other in close
column) with which the rain pours down. Regarding מדונים, Kerı̂ מדינים,
vid., [Pro 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#014.md); the genit. connection
of 'אושׁת מ we have already at [Pro
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009.md). The form נשׁתּוה is doubtful. If
accented, with Lwenstein and others, as Milra, then we would have a
Nithkatal before us, as at [Num 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#047.md),
or a Hothkatal - a passive form of the Kal, the existence of which,
however, is not fully established. Rather this word is to be regarded as
נשׁתּוּה (Nithpa. as [Deu 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#008.md); [Eze
23:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#048).md) without the dagesh, and
lengthened; the form of the word נשׁתּוה, as found in the Cod. Jaman.,
aims at this. But the form נשׁתּוה is better established, e.g., by Cod.
1294, as Milel. Kimchi, Michlol 131a (cf. Ewald, 132c), regards it as a
form without the dagesh, made up the Niph. and Hithpa., leaving the
penultima toning unexplained. Bertheau regards it as a voluntative: let
us compare (as נשׁתּעה, [Isa 41:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023).md);
but as he himself says, the reflexive form does not accord with this
sense. Hitzig has adopted the right explanation (cf. Olshausen, 275, and
Bttcher, 1072, who, however, registers it at random as an Ephraimitism).
נשׁתּוה is a Niphal, with a transposition of consonants for נשׁותה,
since נשׁותה passes over into נשׁתּוה. Such is now the genus in the
arrangement; the Milra form would be as masc. syntactically inaccurate.
"The finite following the subjects is regulated by the gender and number
of that which is next before it, as at [Sa2
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#022.md); [Sa2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#020.md); [Psa
55:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#006.md); [Job
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#015)" (Hitzig.md).

[Proverbs 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 27:16</span></span>

This verse stands in close connection with the preceding, for it speaks
of the contentious woman:

He that restraineth her restraineth the wind,

And oil meeteth his right hand.

The connection of the plur. subject צפניה = quicunque eam cohibet, with
a sing. predicate, is not to be disputed (vid., [Pro
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018.md) and [Pro
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#016), Chethı̂b.md); but can צפן gain from
the meaning of preserving, laying up, also the meanings of keeping, of
confining, and shutting up? - for these meanings we have כּלא and עצר
(cf. צרר, [Pro 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004).md). In 16b it lies
nearer to see in ימינו the object of the clause (oil meeteth his right
hand) than the subject (his right hand meeteth oil), for the gender of
ימין directs to יד (e.g., [Eze 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#006.md);
cf. 6a, where נאדּרי is as to gender indifferent): it is fem., while on
the contrary שׁמן is generally masc. (cf. [Sol
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003).md). There is no reason for regarding
ימינו as an adverbial accus. (he meets oil with his right hand), or,
with Hitzig, as a second subject (he meets oil, his right hand); the
latter, in the order of the words lying before us, is not at all
possible. We suppose that יקרא, as at [Gen
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md), is equivalent to יקרה (Ewald,
116c), for the explanation oleum dexterae ejus praeconem agit (Cocceius,
Schultens) does not explain, but only darkens: and oleum dexter su
legit, i.e., colligit (Fleischer), is based on an untenable use of the
word. As one may say of person to person, קרך, occurrit tibi, [Num
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#018), so also יקרא (יקרה.md), of a thing
that meets a man or one of his members; and if we compare לקראת and קרי,
then for 16b the meaning is possible: oil meets his right hand; the
quarrelsome woman is like oil that cannot be held in the hand, which
struggles against that which holds it, for it always glides out of the
hand. Thus also Luther: "and seeks to hold oil with his hand," as if he
read יקמץ. In fact, this word was more commonly used as the expression
of untenableness than the colourless and singular word יקרא, which,
besides, is so ambiguous, that none of the old translators has thought
on any other קרא than that which signifies "to call," "to name." The
Jewish interpreters also adhere to this nearest lying קרא, and,
moreover, explain, as the Syr., Targ., Aquila, Symmachus, Jerome, and
the Venet., שׁמן ימינו, according to the accentuation as genit.
connected, e.g., Rashi: he calls for oil to his right hand, viz., as the
means of purification from leprosy, [Lev
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014.md) \[[Lev
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#016.md)\]; and Aben Ezra: even when he
calls for oil to his right hand, i.e., would move them to silence with
the precious anointing oil. Perhaps [Pro
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#016.md) was originally an independent
proverb as follows:

צפני הון צפן רוח

ושמן ימינו יקרא

He who layeth up riches in store layeth up the wind,

And he nameth them the fat of his right hand;

i.e., he sees in them that which makes his right hand fat and strong
(שׁמן, as at [Psa 109:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#024.md), opp. [Zac
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017.md); cf. בּמשׁמנּיו, [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md), and regarding Ἐσμούν, the
Phoenician god of health, at [Isa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010).md), and yet it is only the wind,
i.e., something that is worthless and transient, which he stored up
(צפן, as at [Pro 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022.md), and in
מצפּניו, Obad. [Oba 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#006).md). הון is used
as it frequently occurs in the Book of Proverbs, e.g., [Pro
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004.md), and the whole proverb expresses
by another figure the same as [Pro
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#011). The fact that צפון (רוח.md), [Pro
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#023.md), and as a contrast thereto in
the compass ימין (the south), hovered before the poet, may not have been
without its influence on the choice of the words and expression here.

[Proverbs 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 27:17</span></span>

This proverb expresses the influence arising from the intercourse of man
with man:

Iron is sharpened by iron,

And a man may sharpen the appearance of another.

When the Masora reads יחד, Ewald remarks, it interprets the word as
denoting "at the same time," and the further meaning of the proverb must
then accord therewith. Accordingly he translates: "iron together with
iron! and one together with the face of another!" But then the prep. ב
or עם is wanting after the second יחד - for יחד is, in spite of Ewald,
217h, never a prep. - and the "face," 17b, would be a perplexing
superfluity. Hitzig already replies, but without doing homage to the
traditional text-punctuation, that such a violence to the use of
language, and such a darkening of the thought, is not at all to be
accepted. He suggests four ways of interpreting יחד: (1) the adverb יחד,
united, properly (taken accusat.) union; (2) יחד, [Psa
86:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#011.md), imper. of the Piel יחד, unite;
(3) יחדּ, [Job 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#006.md), jussive of the Kal
חדה, gaudeat; and (4) as Kimchi, in Michlol 126a, jussive of the Kal חדה
(= חדד) acuere, after the form תחז, [Mic
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md). ויּחץ, [Gen
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#008.md), etc. in p. יחד, after the form
אחז, [Job 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009.md). ויּחל, [Kg2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002.md) (= ויּחלא, [Ch2
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012).md). If we take יחד with בּרזל,
then it is priori to be supposed that in יחד the idea of sharpening
lies; in the Arab. iron is simply called hadyda = חדוּד, that which is
sharpened, sharp; and a current Arab. proverb says: alḥadyd balḥadyd
yuflah = ferrum ferro diffinditur (vid., Freytag under the word falah).
But is the traditional text-punctuation thus understood to be rightly
maintained? It may be easily changed in conformity with the meaning, but
not so that with Bttcher we read יחד and יחד, the fut. Kal of חדד: "iron
sharpeneth itself on iron, and a man sharpeneth himself over against his
neighbour" - for פני after a verb to be understood actively, has to be
regarded as the object - but since יחד is changed into יחד (fut. Hiph.
of חדד), and יחד into יחד or יחד (fut. Hiph. of חדד, after the form אחל,
incipiam, [Deu 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025.md), or אחל,
profanabo, [Eze 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#007.md); [Num
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003).md). The passive rendering of the
idea 17a and the active of 17b thus more distinctly appear, and the
unsuitable jussive forms are set aside: ferrum ferro exacuitur, et homo
exacuit faciem amici sui (Jerome, Targ., the Venet.). But that is not
necessary. As ויּעל may be the fut. of the Hiph. (he brought up) as well
as of the Kal (he went up), so יחד may be regarded as fut. Kal, and יחד
as fut. Hiph. Fleischer prefers to render יחד also as Hiph.: aciem
exhibet, like יעשׁיר, divitias acquirit, and the like; but the jussive
is not favourable to this supposition of an intransitive (inwardly
transitive) Hiph. It may indeed be said that the two jussives appear to
be used, according to poetic licence, with the force of indicatives (cf.
under [Pro 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#026).md), but the repetition
opposes it. Thus we explain: iron is sharpened \[gewetzt, Luther uses
this appropriate word\] by iron (ב of the means, not of the object,
which was rather to be expected in 17b after [Pro
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#030).md), and a man whets פני, the
appearance, the deportment, the nature, and manner of the conduct of his
neighbour. The proverb requires that the intercourse of man with man
operate in the way of sharpening the manner and forming the habits and
character; that one help another to culture and polish of manner, rub
off his ruggedness, round his corners, as one has to make use of iron
when he sharpens iron and seeks to make it bright. The jussive form is
the oratorical form of the expression of that which is done, but also of
that which is to be done.

[Proverbs 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 27:18</span></span>

The following three proverbs are connected with 17 in their similarity
of form: -

18 Whosoever watcheth the fig-tree will enjoy its fruit;

And he that hath regard to his master attaineth to honour.

The first member is, as in [Pro 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#017.md),
only the means of contemplating the second; as faithful care of the tree
has fruit for a reward, so faithful regard for one's master, honour; נצר
is used as at [Isa 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003.md), שׁמר as at
[Hos 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md), etc. - the proverb is valid
in the case of any kind of master up to the Lord of lords. The fig-tree
presented itself, as Heidenheim remarks, as an appropriate figure;
because in the course of several years' training it brings forth its
fruit, which the language of the Mishna distinguishes as פגין, unripe,
בוחל, half ripe, and צמל, fully ripe. To fruit in the first line
corresponds honour in the second, which the faithful and attentive
servant attains unto first on the part of his master, and then also from
society in general.

[Proverbs 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 27:19</span></span>

19 As it is with water, face correspondeth to face,

So also the heart of man to man.

Thus the traditional text is to be translated; for on the supposition
that כּמּים must be used for כּבמּים, yet it might not be translated: as
in waters face corresponds to face (Jerome: quomodo in aquis resplendent
vultus respicientium), because כּ (instar) is always only a prep. and
never conj. subordinating to itself a whole sentence (vid., under [Psa
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#014).md). But whether כּמּים, "like
water," may be an abridgment of a sentence: "like as it is with water,"
is a question, and the translation of the lxx (Syr., Targ., Arab.),
ὥσπερ οὐχ ὅμοια πρόσωπα προσώποις, κ.τ.λ., appears, according to
Bttcher's ingenious conjecture, to have supposed כאשר במים, from which
the lxx derived כּאין דּמים, sicut non pares. The thought is beautiful:
as in the water-mirror each one beholds his own face (Luther: der Scheme
= the shadow), so out of the heart of another each sees his own heart,
i.e., he finds in another the dispositions and feelings of his own heart
(Fleischer) - the face finds in water its reflection, and the heart of a
man finds in man its echo; men are ὁμοιοπαθεῖς, and it is a fortunate
thing that their heart is capable of the same sympathetic feelings, so
that one can pour into the heart of another that which fills and moves
his own heart, and can there find agreement with it, and a re-echo. The
expression with ל is extensive: one corresponds to another, one belongs
to another, is adapted to the other, turns to the other, so that the
thought may be rendered in manifold ways: the divinely-ordained mutual
relationship is always the ground-thought. This is wholly obliterated by
Hitzig's conjecture כּמוּם, "what a mole on the face is to the face,
that is man's heart to man," i.e., the heart is the dark spot in man,
his partie honteuse. But the Scripture nowhere speaks of the human heart
after this manner, at least the Book of Proverbs, in which לב frequently
means directly the understanding. Far more intelligible and consistent
is the conjecture of Mendel Stern, to which Abrahamsohn drew my
attention: כּמּים הפּנים לפנים, like water (viz., flowing water), which
directs its course always forward, thus (is turned) the heart of man to
man. This conjecture removes the syntactic harshness of the first member
without changing the letters, and illustrates by a beautiful and
excellent figure the natural impulse moving man to man. It appears,
however, to us, in view of the lxx, more probable that כּמּים is
abbreviated from the original כאשׁר במים (cf. [Pro
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#029).md).

[Proverbs 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 27:20</span></span>

The following proverb has, in common with the preceding, the catchword
האדם, and the emphatic repetition of the same expression:

20 The under-world and hell are not satisfied,

And the eyes of man are not satisfied.

A Kerı̂ ואבדון is here erroneously noted by Lwenstein, Stuart, and
others. The Kerı̂ to ואבדּה is here ואבדּו, which secures the right
utterance of the ending, and is altogether wanting

(Note: In Gesen. Lex. this אבדה stands to the present day under אבדה.)

in many MSS (e.g., Cod. Jaman). The stripping off of the ן from the
ending ון is common in the names of persons and places (e.g., שׁלמה, lxx
Σολομών and שׁלה); we write at pleasure either ow or oh (e.g., מגדּו),
Olsh. 215g. אבדּה (אבדּו) of the nature of a proper name, is already
found in its full form אבדּון at [Pro
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011.md), along with שׁאול; the two
synonyms are, as was there shown, not wholly alike in the idea they
present, as the underworld and realm of death, but are related to each
other almost the same as Hades and Gehenna; אבדון is what is called

(Note: Vid., Frankel, Zu dem Targum der Propheten (1872), p. 25.)

in the Jonathan-Targum בּית אבדּנא, the place of destruction, i.e., of
the second death (מותא תנינא). The proverb places Hades and Hell on the
one side, and the eyes of man on the other, on the same line in respect
of their insatiableness. To this Fleischer adds the remark: cf. the
Arab. al'ayn l'a taml'aha all'a altrab, nothing fills the eyes of man
but at last the dust of the grave - a strikingly beautiful expression!
If the dust of the grave fills the open eyes, then they are full -
fearful irony! The eye is the instrument of seeing, and consequently in
so far as it always looks out after and farther, it is the instrument
and the representation of human covetousness. The eye is filled, is
satisfied, is equivalent to: human covetousness is appeased. But first
"the desire of the eye," [Jo1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016.md), is
meant in the proper sense. The eyes of men are not satisfied in looking
and contemplating that which is attractive and new, and no command is
more difficult to be fulfilled than that in [Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md), "...that shutteth his eyes from
seeing evil." There is therefore no more inexhaustible means, impiae
sepculationis, than the desire of the eyes.

There follow here two proverbs which have in common with each other the
figures of the crucible and the mortar:

21 The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold,

And a man according to the measure of his praise;

i.e., silver and gold one values according to the result of the smelting
crucible and the smelting furnace; but a man, according to the measure
of public opinion, which presupposes that which is said in [Pro
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#008.md), "according to the measure of his
wisdom is a man praised." מהלל is not a ῥῆμα μέσον like our Leumund
\[renown\], but it is a graduated idea which denotes fame down to evil
Lob \[fame\], which is only Lob \[praise\] per antiphrasin. Ewald
otherwise: "according to the measure of his glorying;" or Hitzig better:
"according to the measure with which he praises himself," with the
remark: "מהלל is not the act, the glorifying of self, but the object of
the glorying (cf. מבטח, מדון), i.e., that in which he places his glory."
Bttcher something further: "one recognises him by that which he is
generally wont to praise in himself and others, persons and things."
Thus the proverb is to be understood; but in connection with [Pro
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#008.md) it seems to us more probable that
המלל is thought of as going forth from others, and not as from himself.
In line first, [Pro 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003.md) is repeated;
the second line there is conformable to the first, according to which it
should be here said that the praise of a man is for him what the
crucible and the furnace is for metal. The lxx, Syr., Targ., Jerome, and
the Venet. read לפי מהללו, and thereby obtain more concinnity. Luther
accordingly translates:

A man is tried by the mouth of his praise,

As silver in the crucible and gold in the furnace.

Others even think to interpret man as the subject examining, and so they
vocalize the words. Thus e.g., Fleischer: Qualis est catinus argento et
fornax auro, talis sit homo ori a quo laudatur, so that "mouth of his
praise" is equivalent to the man who praises him with his mouth. But
where, as here, the language relates to relative worth, the supposition
for לפי, that it denotes, as at [Pro
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#008.md), pro ratione, is tenable. And
that the mouth of him who praises is a smelting crucible for him who is
praised, or that the praised shall be a crucible for the mouth of him
who praises, would be a wonderful comparison. The lxx has here also an
additional distich which has no place in the Heb. text.

[Proverbs 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 27:22</span></span>

22 Though thou bruise a fool in a mortar among grit with a pestle,

Yet would not his folly depart from him.

According to the best accredited accentuations, אם־תּכתּושׁ has Illuj.
and בּמּכתּשׁ has Pazer, not Rebia, which would separate more than the
Dechi, and disturb the sequence of the thoughts. The first line is long;
the chief disjunctive in the sphere of the Athnach is Dechi of 'הר, this
disjoins more than the Pazer of 'בּם, and this again more than the
Legarmeh of את־האויל. The ה of הרפות does not belong to the stem of the
word (Hitzig), but is the article; רפות (from רוּף, to shake, to break;
according to Schultens, from רפת, to crumble, to cut in pieces, after
the form קיטור, which is improbable) are bruised grains of corn (peeled
grain, grit), here they receive this name in the act of being bruised;
rightly Aquila and Theodotion, ἐν μέσῳ ἐμπτισσομένων (grains of corn in
the act of being pounded or bruised), and the Venet. μέσον τῶν πτισανῶν.

(Note: The lxx translates ἐν μέσῳ συνεδρίου, and has thereby misled the
Syr., and mediately the Targum.)

In בּעלי (thus to be written after Michlol 43b, not בּעלי, as Heidenheim
writes it without any authority) also the article is contained. מכתשׁ is
the vessel, and the ב of בעלי is Beth instrumenti; עלי (of lifting up
for the purpose of bruising) is the club, pestle (Luther: stempffel =
pounder); in the Mishna, Beza i. 5, this word denotes a pounder for the
cutting out of flesh. The proverb interprets itself: folly has become to
the fool as a second nature, and he is not to be delivered from it by
the sternest discipline, the severest means that may be tried; it is not
indeed his substance (Hitzig), but an inalienable accident of his
substance.

[Proverbs 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 27:23</span></span>

An exhortation to rural industry, and particularly to the careful
tending of cattle for breeding, forms the conclusion of the foregoing
series of proverbs, in which we cannot always discern an intentional
grouping. It is one of the Mashal-odes spoken of vol. i. p. 12. It
consists of 11 = 4 + 7 lines.

23 Give heed to the look of thy small cattle,

Be considerate about the herds.

24 For prosperity continues not for ever;

And does the diadem continue from generation to generation?

25 (But) the hay is gone, and the after-growth appears,

And the grass of the mountains is gathered:

26 Lambs serve to clothe thee,

And goats are the price of a field.

27 And there is plenty of goats' milk for thy nourishment,

And for the nourishment of thy house,

And subsistence for thy maidens.

The beginning directs to the fut., as is not common in these proverbs,
vid., [Pro 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#026.md). With ידע, to take
knowledge, which is strengthened by the inf. intensivus, is interchanged
שׁית לב, which means at [Pro 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#032.md) to
consider well, but here, to be careful regarding anything. צאן is the
small or little cattle, thus sheep and goats. Whether לעדרים (here and
at [Isa 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#002).md) contains the article is
questionable (Gesen. 35. 2 A), and, since the herds are called העדרים,
is not probable; thus: direct thy attention to the herds, that is, to
this, that thou hast herds. פּני is the external side in general; here,
the appearance which the sheep present; thus their condition as seen
externally. In [Pro 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024.md) I formerly
regarded נזר as a synonym of גּז, to be understood of the produce of
wool, or, with Hitzig, of the shearing of the meadow, and thus the
produce of the meadow. But this interpretation of the word is untenable,
and [Pro 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#025.md) provides for [Pro
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024.md), thus understood, no natural
continuation of thought. That חסן signifies a store, fulness of
possessions, property, and abundance, has already been shown under [Pro
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#006.md); but נזר is always the mark of
royal, and generally of princely dignity, and here denotes, per meton.
signi pro re signata, that dignity itself. With the negative expression
in 24a the interrogative in 24b is interchanged as at [Job
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#009.md), with the implied negative
answer; ואם, of an oath ("and truly not," as at [Isa
62:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008).md), presents the same thought, but
with a passionate colouring here unnecessary. Rightly Fleischer: "ready
money, moveable property, and on the other hand the highest positions of
honour, are far more easily torn away from a man, and secure to him far
less of quiet prosperity, than husbandry, viewed particularly with
respect to the rearing of cattle." In other words: the possession of
treasures and of a lofty place of power and of honour has not in itself
the security of everlasting duration; but rural economy, and
particularly the rearing of cattle, gives security for food and
clothing. The Chethı̂b לדור דור is found, e.g., at [Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015.md); the Kerı̂ לדּור ודור substitutes
the more usual form. If [Pro 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#025.md) was
an independent whole (Hitzig: grass vanishes and fresh green appears,
etc.), then the meaning here and onward would be that in the sphere of
husbandry it is otherwise than is said in [Pro
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024.md) : there that which is consumed
renews itself, and there is an enlarging circulation. But this contrast
to [Pro 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024.md) must be expressed and
formed unambiguously. The connection is rather this, that [Pro
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md) commends the rearing of cattle,
[Pro 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024.md) confirms it, and 25ff.
discuss what real advantages, not dependent on the accidents of public
and social life, it brings.

I rejoice to agree with Fleischer in the opinion that the perfects of
[Pro 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#025.md) form a complex hypothetical
antecedent to [Pro 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#026.md) : Quum
evanuerit gramen (sc. vetus) et apparuerint herbae recentes et collecta
fuerint pabula montium, agni vestitui tuo (inservient) et pretium agri
(sc. a te emendi) erunt hirci, i.e., then wilt thou nourish thy herds of
sheep and goats with the grass on thy fields, and with the dried
gathered hay; and these will yield for thee, partly immediately and
partly by the money derived therefrom (viz., from the valuable goats not
needed for the flocks), all that is needful for thy life. He also
remarks, under גּלה, that it means to make a place void, empty (viz., to
quit the place, vacuer la forteresse); hence to leave one's fatherland
or home, to wander abroad; thus, rhetorically and poetically of things
and possessions: to disappear. חציר (from חצר, to be green) is hay, and
דּשׁא the after-growing second crop (after-grass); thus a meadow capable
of being mowed a second time is though of. עשּׂבות הרים (with Dag.
dirimens, as e.g., ענּבי [Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032).md)
are the herbage of the mountains. The time when one proceeds to
sheep-shearing, [Pro 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#025.md) cannot
intend to designate; it sets before us an interesting rural harvest
scene, where, after a plentiful ingathering of hay, one sees the meadows
again overspread with new grass (Ewald); but with us the shearing of
sheep takes place in the month of May, when the warm season of the year
is just at hand. The poet means in general to say, that when the hay is
mown and now the herbage is grown up, and also the fodder from the
mountains ([Psa 106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020).md) has been
gathered home, when thus the barns are filled with plenty, the
husbandman is guaranteed against the future on all sides by his stock of
cattle. חלב (from חלב, Arab. halyb, with halab) is the usual metaplastic
connecting form of חלב, milk. דּי (from דּי, like חי from חי), generally
connected with the genitive of the person or thing, for which anything
is sufficient (e.g., [Pro 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#016.md),
דּיּך, to which Fleischer compares Arab. hasbuha, tassuha kifayuha), has
here the genitive of the thing of which, or in which, one has enough.
The complex subject-conception is limited by Rebia, and the governing
דּי has the subordinated disjunctive Legarmeh. עזּים is a word of two
genders (epicoenum), Gesen. 107, 1d. In וחיּים the influence of the ל
still continues; one does not need to supply it meanwhile, since all
that maintains and nourishes life can be called חיים (vita = victus),
e.g., [Pro 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022.md). The lxx translates
בּיתך by σῶν θεραπόντων, and omits (as also the Syr., but not the
Syro-Hexap.) the last line as now superfluous; but that the maids
attending to the cattle - by whom we particularly think of milkers - are
especially mentioned, intentionally presents the figure of a
well-ordered household, full of varied life and activity (Job 40:29).
