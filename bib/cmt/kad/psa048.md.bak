[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 48:0</span></span>

The inaccessibleness of the City of God

[Psa 48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md) is also a song of
thanksgiving for victory. It is connected with [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md) and [Psa
47:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md) by the fundamental thought of
the exaltation of Jahve above the peoples of the earth; but is
distinguished from them both in this respect, viz., that, in accordance
with the favourite characteristic of Korahitic poetry, the song of
thanksgiving for victory has become a song in praise of Jerusalem, the
glorious and strong city, protected by God who sits enthroned in it. The
historical occasion is the same. The mention of the kings points to an
army of confederates; [Psa 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#010.md)
points to the gathering held in the temple before the setting out of the
army; and the figurative representation of the hostile powers by the
shattered ships of Tarshish does not apply to any period so well as to
the time of Jehoshaphat. The points of coincidence between this Psalm
(cf. [Psa 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007.md) with [Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014.md); [Psa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008.md) with [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md); [Psa
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#013.md) with [Isa
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018.md); v. 15 with [Isa
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022).md), as well as [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md), and Isaiah do not prove that
he is its author.

[Psalms 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 48:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 48:2-9) Viewed as to the nature of its subject-matter, the Psalm
divides itself into three parts. We begin by considering the three
strophes of the first part. The middle strophe presents an instance of
the rising and falling caesural schema. Because Jahve has most
marvellously delivered Jerusalem, the poet begins with the praise of the
great King and of His Holy City. Great and praised according to His due
(מהלּל as in [Psa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004).md) is He in her,
is He upon His holy mountain, which there is His habitation. Next
follow, in [Psa 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003.md), two predicates
of a threefold, or fundamentally only twofold, subject; for ירכּתי צפון,
in whatever way it may be understood, is in apposition to הר־ציּון. The
predicates consequently refer to Zion-Jerusalem; for קרית מלך רב is not
a name for Zion, but, inasmuch as the transition is from the holy
mountain to the Holy City (just as the reverse is the case in [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002).md), Jerusalem; ὅτι πόλις ἐστὶ τοῦ
μεγάλου βασιλέως, [Mat 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#035.md). Of
Zion-Jerusalem it is therefore said, it is יפה נוף, beautiful in
prominence or elevation (נוף from נוּף, Arabic nâfa, nauf, root נף, the
stronger force of נב, Arab. nb, to raise one's self, to mount, to come
sensibly forward; just as יפה also goes back to a root יף, Arab. yf, wf,
which signifies "to rise, to be high," and is transferred in the Hebrew
to eminence, perfection, beauty of form), a beautifully rising
terrace-like height;

(Note: Luther with Jerome (departing from the lxx and Vulgate) renders
it: "Mount Zion is like a beautiful branch," after the Mishna-Talmudic
נוף, a branch, Maccoth 12a, which is compared also by Saadia and Dunash.
The latter renders it "beautiful in branches," and refers it to the
Mount of Olives.)

and, in the second place, it is the joy (משׂושׂ) of the whole earth. It
is deserving of being such, as the people who dwell there are themselves
convinced ([Lam 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015).md); and it is
appointed to become such, it is indeed such even now in hope, - hope
which is, as it were, being anticipatorily verified. but in what sense
does the appositional ירכּתי צפון follow immediately upon הר־ציּון?
Hitzig, Ewald, Hengstenberg, Caspari (Micha, p. 359), and others, are of
opinion that the hill of Zion is called the extreme north with reference
to the old Asiatic conception of the mountain of the gods - old Persic
Ar-bur'g (Al-bur'g), and also called absolutely hara or haraiti,

(Note: Vid., Spiegel, Erân, S. 287f.)

old Indian Kailâsa and Mêru

(Note: Vide Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, ii. 847.)

\- forming the connecting link between heaven and earth, which lay in
the inaccessible, holy distance and concealment of the extreme north.
But the poet in no way betrays the idea that he applies this designation
to Zion in an ideal sense only, as being not inferior to the extreme
north (Bertheau, Lage des Paradieses, S. 50, and so also S. D. Luzzatto
on [Isa 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013).md), or as having taken the
place of it (Hitzig). That notion is found, it is true, in [Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013.md), in the mouth of the king of the
Chaldeans; but, with the exception of the passage before us, we have no
trace of the Israelitish mind having blended this foreign mythological
style of speech with its own. We therefore take the expression "sides of
the north" to be a topographical designation, and intended literally.
Mount Zion is thereby more definitely designated as the Temple-hill; for
the Temple-hill, or Zion in the narrower sense, formed in reality the
north-eastern angle or corner of ancient Jerusalem. It is not
necessarily the extreme north ([Eze
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#006.md); [Eze
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#002).md), which is called ירכתי צפון; for
ירכּתים are the two sides, then the angle in which the two side lines
meet, and just such a northern angle was Mount Moriah by its position in
relation to the city of David and the lower city.

[Psa 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003.md)

(Heb.: 48:4) [Psa 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003.md), where the
pointing is rightly נודע, not נודע, shows that the praise sung by the
poet is based upon an event in contemporary history. Elohim has made
Himself known by the loftily built parts

(Note: lxx: ἐν ταῖς βάρεσιν αὐτῆς, on which Gregory of Nyssa remarks
(Opera, Ed. Paris, t. i. p. 333): βάρεις λέγει τάς τῶν οἰκοδομημάτων
περιγραφεὶς ἐν τετραγώνῳ τῷ σχήματι.)

of Jerusalem ([Psa 122:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#007).md) למשׂגּב (the
ל that is customary with verbs of becoming and making), i.e., as an
inaccessible fortress, making them secure against any hostile attack.
The fact by which He has thus made Himself known now immediately
follows. המּלכים points to a definite number of kings known to the poet;
it therefore speaks in favour of the time of peril and war in the reign
of Jehoshaphat and against that in the reign of Hezekiah. נועד is
reciprocal: to appoint themselves a place of meeting, and meet together
there. עבר, as in [Jdg 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md); [Kg2
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#021.md), of crossing the frontier and
invasion (Hitzig), not of perishing and destruction, as in [Psa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036.md), [Nah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012) (De Wette.md); for נועדו requires
further progress, and the declaration respecting their sudden downfall
does not follow till later on. The allies encamped in the desert to
Tekoa, about three hours distant from Jerusalem. The extensive view at
that point extends even to Jerusalem: as soon as they saw it they were
amazed, i.e., the seeing and astonishment, panic and confused flight,
occurred all together; there went forth upon them from the Holy City,
because Elohim dwells therein, a חרדּת אלהים ([Sa1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015).md), or as we should say, a panic
or a panic-striking terror. Concerning כּן as expressive of
simultaneousness, vid., on [Hab 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md).
כּאשׁר in the correlative protasis is omitted, as in [Hos
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002.md), and frequently; cf. on [Isa
55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009.md). Trembling seized upon them there
(שׁם, as in [Psa 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005).md), pangs as of a
woman in travail. In [Psa 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008.md), the
description passes over emotionally into the form of address. It moulds
itself according to the remembrance of a recent event of the poet's own
time, viz., the destruction of the merchant fleet fitted out by
Jehoshaphat in conjunction with Ahaziah, king of Israel ([Kg1
22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049.md); [Ch2
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#036)..md). The general meaning of [Psa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008.md) is, that God's omnipotence is
irresistible. Concerning the "wind of the east quarter," which here, as
in [Eze 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#026.md), causes shipwreck, vid.,
on [Job 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021.md). The "ships of
Tarshish," as is clear from the context both before and after, are not
meant literally, but used as a figure of the worldly powers; Isaiah (Isa
33) also compares Assyria to a gallant ship. Thus, then, the church can
say that in the case of Jerusalem it has, as an eye-witness, experienced
that which it has hitherto only heard from the tradition of a past age
(ראה and שׁמע as in [Job 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005).md), viz.,
that God holds it erect, establishes it, for ever. Hengstenberg observes
here, "The Jerusalem that has been laid in ruins is not that which the
psalmist means; it is only its outward form which it has put off" \[lit.
its broken and deserted pupa\]. It is true that, according to its inner
and spiritual nature, Jerusalem continues its existence in the New
Testament church; but it is not less true that its being trodden under
foot for a season in the kairoi' ethnoo'n no more annuls the promise of
God than Israel's temporary rejection annuls Israel's election. The Holy
City does not fall without again rising up.

[Psalms 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 48:9</span></span>

(Heb.: 48:10-12) Now follows grateful praise to God, who hears prayer
and executes justice, to the joy of His city and of His people. By
דּמּינוּ the poet refers back to the service held in the temple before
the army set out, as narrated in 2 Chr. 20, to the prayers offered in
the time of their impending danger, and to the remembrance of the favour
hitherto shown towards Jerusalem, from which source they drew the
comfort of hope for the present time. דּמּה, to compare, to hold one
thing over against another, in this instance by causing the history of
the past to pass before one's mind. To God's mighty deeds of old is now
added a new one. The Name of God, i.e., the sum of His self-attestations
hitherto, was the subject of the דמינו in the temple, and more
particularly of the Korahitic songs ([Ch2
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#019).md); and this name has gloriously
verified itself by a new deed of righteousness. His fame extends even to
the ends of the earth ([Ch2 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#029).md). He
has proved Himself to be One whose right hand is full of righteousness,
and who practises righteousness or justice where it is necessary. Let,
then, the Holy City, let the country cities of Judah ([Isa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009.md), cf. [Psa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002).md) rejoice. The whole inheritance
of Israel was threatened. Now it is most gloriously delivered.

[Psalms 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 48:12</span></span>

(Heb.: 48:13-15) The call is addressed not to the enemies of Jerusalem -
for it would be absurd to invite such to look round about upon Jerusalem
with joy and gladness - but to the people of Jerusalem itself. From the
time of the going forth of the army to the arrival of the news of
victory, they have remained behind the walls of the city in anxious
expectation. Now they are to make the circuit of the city (הקּיף, still
more definite than סבב, [Jos 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#003).md)
outside the walls, and examine them and see that its towers are all
standing, its bulwark is intact, its palaces are resplendent as
formerly. לחילה, "upon its bulwark," = לחילהּ ([Zac
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#004).md), with softened suffix as in [Isa
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017.md); [Psa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006.md), and frequently; Ew. 247, d.
פּסּג (according to another reading, הפסיג) signifies, in B. Baba kamma
81b, to cut through (a vineyard in a part where there is no way leading
through it); the signification "to take to pieces and examine, to
contemplate piece by piece," has no support in the usage of the
language, and the signification "to extol" (erhhen, Luther following
Jewish tradition) rests upon a false deduction from the name פּסגּה.
Louis de Dieu correctly renders it: Dividite palatia, h. e. obambulate
inter palatia ejus, secando omnes palatiorum vias, quo omnia possitis
commode intueri. They are to convince themselves by all possible means
of the uninjured state of the Holy City, in order that they may be able
to tell to posterity, that זה, such an one, such a marvellous helper as
is now manifest to them, is Elohim our God. He will also in the future
guide us.... Here the Psalm closes; for, although נהג is wont to be
construed with עלּ in the signification ἄγειν ἐπὶ ([Psa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002.md); [Isa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010).md), still "at death" \[lit.
dying\], i.e., when it comes to dying (Hengstenberg), or "even unto (על
as in [Psa 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011.md), [Psa
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007)) death" \[lit. dying\] (Hupfeld.md),
forms no suitable close to this thoroughly national song, having
reference to a people of whom the son of Sirach says ([Psa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025).md): ζωὴ ἀνδρὸς ἐν ἀριθμῷ ἡμερῶν
καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ Ἰσραήλ ἀναρίθμητοι. The rendering of Mendelssohn,
Stier, and others, "over death" i.e., beyond death (Syriac), would be
better; more accurately: beyond dying = destruction (Bunsen, Bibelwerk,
Th. i. S. clxi.). but the expression does not admit of this extension,
and the thought comes upon one unexpectedly and as a surprise in this
Psalm belonging to the time before the Exile. The Jerusalem Talmud,
Megilla, ch. ii. (fol. 73, col. b, ed. Venet.), present a choice of the
following interpretations: (1) עלמוּת = בּעלימוּת, in youthfulness,
adopting which, but somewhat differently applied, the Targum renders,
"in the days of youth;" (2) כעילין עלמות, like virgins, with which
Luther's rendering coincides: like youth (wie die Jugent); (3) according
to the reading עלמות, which the lxx also reproduces: in this and the
future world, noting at the same time that Akilas (Aquila) translates
the word by ἀθανασία: "in a world where there is no death." But in
connection with this last rendering one would rather expect to find
אל־מות ([Pro 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028).md) instead of על־מות.
עלמות, however, as equivalent to αἰῶνες is Mishnic, not Biblical; and a
Hebrew word עלמוּת (עלימוּת) in the sense of the Aramaic עלּימתּ cannot
be justified elsewhere. We see from the wavering of the MSS, some of
which give על־מוּת, and others עלמוּת, and from the wavering of
expositors, what little success is likely to follow any attempt to gain
for על־מות, as a substantial part of the Psalm, any sense that is secure
and in accordance both with the genius of the language and with the
context. Probably it is a marginal note of the melody, an abbreviation
for על־מוּת לבּן, [Psa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md). And either
this note, as in [Hab 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019.md) למנצּח
בּנגינותי, stands in an exceptional manner at the end instead of the
beginning (Hitzig, Reggio), or it belongs to the למנצח of the following
Psalm, and is to be inserted there (Bttcher, De inferis, 371). If,
however, על־מות does not belong to the Psalm itself, then it must be
assumed that the proper closing words are lost. The original close was
probably more full-toned, and somewhat like [Isa
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022.md).
