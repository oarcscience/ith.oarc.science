Concerning Ammon, Edom, Damascus, Kedar, Hazor, Elam

Concerning the Children of Ammon. - The Ammonites were, not merely as
regards descent, but also as to their character and their relation to
Israel, the twin-people with the Moabites. From them, too, as well as
from the Moabites, Sihon the king of the Ammonites had wrenched a
portion of their territory, which the Israelites received for a
possession after Sihon had been subdued. This territory they sought
every opportunity of retaking from the Israelites, whom they as
constantly endeavoured to humiliate when they could. Besides their
connection with Eglon the Moabite king ([Jdg
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013).md), they oppressed Israel during
the period of the judges for eighteen years, not only in Gilead, but
also on this side of Jordan, since they fought against Ephraim,
Benjamin, and Judah ([Jdg 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007.md)., [Jer
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#012) -32.md). During Samuel's time,
their king Nahash besieged Jabesh-gilead, and demanded the surrender of
the city under shameful conditions, in consequence of which they were
defeated by Saul (1 Sam 2). During the time of David they disgracefully
treated his ambassadors, who had come to comfort King Hanun over the
death of his father; they then united with the Syrians against Israel,
but were defeated by Joab, and, after the taking of their capital,
Rabbah, severely chastised ([Sa2 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md)
to [Sa2 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md), and [Sa2
12:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026).md). Under the reign of
Jehoshaphat, also, in company with the Moabites, they invaded Judah (2
Chron 20); and when, later, the Israelites were heavily oppressed by the
Syrians under Hazael, the Ammonites practised cruelties on them in
Gilead, for which the prophet Amos ([Amo
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013).md) threatens them with
devastation of their country and foreign captivity. After the death of
Jeroboam II, who had restored the borders of Israel as far as the Dead
Sea ([Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md), the Ammonites must
have made fresh attempts to enlarge their territory during the
interregnum that had begun in the kingdom of the ten tribes; for it is
mentioned in [Ch2 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008.md) that they
brought presents to King Uzziah, i.e., paid tribute, and had thus been
rendered tributary to him: it is also stated in [Ch2
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005.md) that his son Jotham marched
against them in order to enforce the payment of the tribute. But when,
soon afterwards, Tiglath-pileser the Assyrian carried away the tribes of
Israel on the east of the Jordan ([Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md); [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026).md), the Ammonites seized possession
of the depopulated country of the tribes of Gad and Reuben, while they
also seized Heshbon on the border of these two tribal territories. This
unjust appropriation of Israelitish territory forms the starting-point
of the prophecy now before us.

Ammon has taken possession of the inheritance of Gad, therefore must his
cities be destroyed by war, that Israel may again obtain his own
property ([Jer 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md), [Jer
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#002).md). Ammon will sorrow deeply, for
his god will go with his princes into captivity ([Jer
49:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#002).md). His trust in the wealth of
his land will not help him, but his people will be frightened away
through terror on every side, yet they will be restored in the future
([Jer 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#005.md), [Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 49:1</span></span>

"Concerning the children of Ammon, thus saith Jahveh: Hath Israel no
sons, or hath he no heir? Why doth their king inherit Gad, and his
people dwell in his cities? [Jer 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#002.md).
Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith Jahveh, when I will cause to
be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon a war-cry; and it shall
become a heap of ruins, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: and
Israel shall heir those who heired him, saith Jahveh. [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md). Howl, O Heshbon! for Ai is laid
waste. Cry! ye daughters of Rabbah, gird yourselves with sackcloth;
lament, and run up and down among the enclosures: for their king shall
go into captivity, his priests and his princes together. [Jer
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#004.md). Why dost thou glory in the
valleys? Thy valley flows away, O thou rebellious daughter, that trusted
in her treasures, \[saying\], Who shall come to me? [Jer
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#005.md). Behold, I will bring a fear upon
thee, saith the Lord Jahveh of hosts, from all that is round thee; and
ye shall be driven each one before him, and there shall be none to
gather together the fugitives. [Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md). But afterwards I will turn the
captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jahveh."

The address begins with a question full of reproach: "Has Israel, then,
no sons who could take possession of his land as their inheritance, that
the king of the Ammonites has taken possession of Gad (i.e., of the
hereditary portion of the tribe of Gad), and dwells in the cities of
Gad?" The question presupposes that the Israelites had been carried away
by Tiglath-pileser, but at the same time, also, that the country still
belongs to the Gadites, for they certainly have sons who shall again
receive the inheritance of their fathers. Since Jeremiah, as is clear
from [Jer 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md), had [Amo
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md) in his mind, he evidently uses
מלכּם in a double sense, not merely in [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md), but even in [Jer
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md) also, with a reference to [Amo
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015.md), meaning the king and god of the
Ammonites. As in Amos, Aquila, Symmachus, Jerome, and the Syriac, so in
this passage also, the lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac have understood מלכּם of
the god מלכּם; with them agree Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf. But the reasons
alleged for the change of מלכּם into מלכּם are quite as insufficient
here as in [Amo 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015.md). Just as, in the
last-named passage, מלכּם first of all refers to the king of the
Ammonites, so is it here. It is not the god, but the king, of the
Ammonites that has taken possession of the territory of Gad. It is not
till [Jer 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md) that the reference to
the god Milcom plainly comes out. [Jer
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#002.md). Therefore shall Rabbah, the
capital of the Ammonites, hear the cry of war, and be changed into a
heap of ruins. רבּת בּני , "The great (city) of the sons of Ammon," is
the full name of the Ammonite capital (cf. [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011).md), which is usually called,
briefly, רבּה ([Amo 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#014.md); [Sa2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001), etc..md); it was afterwards called
Philadelphia, probably after Ptolemy Philadelphus, in Polybius'
̔Ραββατάμανα, in Abulfeda Amn, which is the name still given to its
ruins on the Nahr Ammn, i.e., the Upper Jabbok; see on [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md). "A cry of war," as in [Jer
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md); cf. [Amo
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#014.md). "A will of desolation," i.e., a
heap of ruins; cf. [Jos 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028.md); [Deu
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#017.md). "her daughters" are the smaller
cities dependent on the capital, - here, all the remaining cities of the
Ammonites; cf. [Num 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025.md); [Jos
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#045.md), etc. "Israel shall heir those
who heired him," i.e., receive back the property of those who have
appropriated his land.

[Jer 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md)

The cities of the Ammonites, i.e., their inhabitants, shall howl and
lament over this calamity. The summons given to Heshbon to howl implies
that this city, formerly the residence of Sihon, was then in possession
of the Ammonites. There is obscurity in the clause announcing the
reason, "for עי (lxx Γαΐ́) is laid waste:" the word seems to be a proper
noun, but there is no city of this name known in the Ammonite country,
or the land east of the Jordan; while we must not think of Ai (העי, [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002)..md), which was situated on the west
side of the Jordan. Venema and Ewald are inclined to take the word as an
appellative, synonymous with תּל, "ruins" (which is the meaning of עי),
and regard it as the subject of Rabbah, the capital, "because it has
been laid in ruins." But a comparison of [Jer
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#020.md); [Jer
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md); [Zac
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#003.md), rather favours our taking עי as
the subject. Graf and others would therefore change עי into ער, as (they
say) the capital of the Ammonites was called by the Israelites. But
there are no historical traces of this designation of Rabbah. There
remains hardly any other course open than to consider עי as the name of
an important Ammonite city. The mere fact that it is mentioned nowhere
else cannot form a strong foundation for the objection against this
assumption, for we do not find anywhere a list of the Ammonite cities.
The inhabitants of the other towns are to put on signs of sorrow, and go
about mourning "in the enclosures," i.e., in the open country, since the
cities, being reduced to ashes, no longer afford shelter. Most
expositors understand גּדרות as meaning sheep-folds ([Num
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#016.md), [Num
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#024.md), [Num
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#036).md); but there is no reason for
taking this special view of the meaning of the word, according to which
גּדרות would stand for גּדרות צאן. גּדרה and גּדר also mean the wall of
a vineyard, or the hedges of the vineyards, and in [Num
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#024.md) specially the enclosure of the
vineyards at the cross-roads in the country east of the Jordan. This is
the meaning here. We must not, with Ngelsbach, think of city walls on
which one could run up and down, for the purpose of taking measures for
defence: the words to not signify the walls of a city. The carrying away
into exile of Malcam with his priests and princes gives the reason for
the sorrow. מלכּם is here not the earthly king, but the god Milcom
viewed as the king of the Ammonites, as is clear from the addition
כּהניו noitidd, and from the parallel passage in [Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md). The clause is copied from [Amo
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015.md), but הוּא has been substituted
for כּהניו, in order that מלכּם may be understood of Milcom, the chief
deity (see on [Kg1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005).md).

[Jer 49:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#004.md)

Thus shall the empty boasting of the Ammonites and their trust in their
riches come to nothing. "Why dost thou boast of the valleys?" i.e., of
the splendid fruitful valleys and plains which, being well watered,
produced large crops of corn and wheat.

(Note: The lxx have in this passage, as in [Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005.md), changed עמק for ענק, and
translated τὶ ἀγαλλιᾶσθε ὲν τοῖς πεδίοις ̓Εννακείμ; here it remains
doubtful whether they have expressed בּעמקים or עמקך by ̓Εννακείμ. On
the ground of this arbitrary paraphrase, Hitzig would at once change
עמקים into ענקים, without considering that the giant races of that
region, to which Og the king of Bashan had also belonged ([Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011).md), were not called ענקים at all,
but זמזמּים by the Ammonites, and אימים by the Moabites ([Deu
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md), [Deu
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020))..md)

זב is viewed by some as an antithesis to what immediately precedes: "thy
valley flows, sc. with the blood of the slain" (Rosenm׬ller and Gesenius
still view it thus); or, "it flows away," i.e., thy valley (viz., its
inhabitants) is scattered, dispersed. But it is quite arbitrary to
supply "with blood;" and even the other explanation - which Hitzig
justifies on the ground that valley or river-bottom stands for what it
contains, i.e., the inhabitants of the valley, and that the population
is represented under the figure of a mass of water running, flowing away
- is very far-fetched. The words cannot form an antithesis to what
precedes (because the description of the confidence shown is still
continued, and the antithesis does not follow till [Jer
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#005).md), but merely a further extension
of the preceding clause. We may, then, either translate, "thy valley
flows, overflows," so that the words shall be subordinated to what
precedes; or we may take זב, with Ewald and Graf, as a noun, in which
case we must repeat the preposition בּ, "the abundance of thy valley."
The singular, "thy valley," means, together with the other valleys of
the country, perhaps the valley of Rabbah; for Ammn lies in a broad
valley along with banks of the Moiet Ammn, which has its source in a
pool two hundred paces from the south-west end of the city (Burckhardt's
Syria, p. 355). Regarding the vicinity, Abulfeda writes (Tabulae Syr.
ed. Mich. p. 92), circumjecta regio arva sativa sunt ac terra bona et
abundans. The direct address, "O rebellious daughter," used of Israel in
[Jer 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#022.md), is here transferred to the
inhabitants of Rabbah, with reference to the fact that the Ammonites,
denying their descent from Lot, behaved like enemies towards Jahveh and
His people. In trusting their riches, they are like the Moabites, [Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md). In this confidence they said,
"Who will come unto us?" i.e., attack us as enemies. Thereupon the Lord
replies, "I will bring on thee fear, terror from all that is round
thee," all the nations that dwell about thee (cf. [Jer
48:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#017.md), [Jer
48:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#039).md), whose distress or overthrow
will put thee in terror. אישׁ = אישׁ לפניו, "every one before him" (cf.
[Jos 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005.md); [Amo
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#003).md), without looking about him, or
turning round (cf. [Jer 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005).md), i.e.,
in the most precipitate flight, with no one to rally the fugitives.
לנּדר is collective.

[Jer 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md)

Yet afterwards, the fortunes of Ammon also shall be changed, as it was
with Moab. [Jer 48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047.md).

Regarding the fulfilment of this prophecy (just as in the case of Moab),
we have no further information than that of Josephus (Ant. x. 9. 7),
that Nebuchadnezzar defeated and subdued the Ammonites in the fifth year
after the destruction of Jerusalem. Shortly before, their king Baalis
had got Gedaliah the governor put out of the way ([Jer
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#014).md). Even after the exile they kept
up their hostile spirit against the Israelites and the Jews, inasmuch as
they tried to hinder the building of the city walls at Jerusalem ([Neh
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001)..md), and in the Maccabean age were
still making war against the Jews; 1 Macc. 5:6, 30-43. Their name was
preserved till the time of Justin Martyr ( ̓Αμμανιτῶν ἐστι νῦν πολὺ
πλῆθος, Dial. Tryph. p. 272). But Origen already comprehends their
country under the general name Arabia (lib. 1 in Jobum).

[Jeremiah 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 49:7</span></span>

Concerning Edom. - To the Edomites, whom Israel were to leave
undisturbed in their possession, since they were a kindred nations ([Deu
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004).md), Balaam announces that "Edom
shall become a possession," i.e., shall be taken possession of by the
ruler rising out of Israel. We have shown, in the explanation given of
[Num 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018.md), that up to the time of the
exile this utterance had been fulfilled merely by feeble attacks being
made, since the Edomites were only temporarily subdued by the
Israelites, then soon made themselves independent again, and made war on
Israel. On account of their implacable hostility towards the people of
God, Ezekiel ([Eze 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012)..md), as well as
Jeremiah in this prophecy, announces ruin to them. The contents of the
prophecy before us are as follow: The far-famed wisdom of Teman will not
preserve Edom from the destruction with which Jahveh will visit it. The
judgment of desolation that has been decreed shall inevitably come on it
([Jer 49:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007).md). The nations shall wage
war against it, and make it small; because of its proud trust in the
strength of its dwelling-place, it shall become the laughing-stock of
every passer-by ([Jer 49:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014).md). As a
lion from the reedy places of Jordan suddenly attacks a herd, the Lord
will drag the Edomites from their rocky dwelling, so that the earth
shall quake with the crash of their fall, and the anguish of death shall
seize their heroes ([Jer 49:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019).md). In
this prophecy Jeremiah has relied much on Obadiah, [Oba
1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001.md), and reproduced much of his
expressions regarding the fall of Edom.

(Note: The use made of Obadiah by Jeremiah has been so convincingly
proved, especially by Caspari in his commentary on Obadiah, that even
Ewald and Graf, who place the prophecy of Obadiah in the time of the
exile, acknowledge this use that has been made of it, and therefore hold
that the first part of the book of Obadiah is a fragment of an older
oracle. This is a hypothesis which we have already shown, in the
introduction to Obadiah, to be untenable.)

According to what has been said, his address falls into three strophes.
In the first ([Jer 49:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007).md), the
judgment breaking over Edom is depicted as one that cannot be averted,
and as having been irrevocably decreed by the Lord; in the second ([Jer
49:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014).md), it is set forth as to its
nature and the occasion of its occurrence; and in the third ([Jer
49:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019).md), as to its completion and
consequences.

[Jer 49:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md)

The judgment as inevitable. - [Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md). "Thus saith Jahveh of hosts: Is
there no more wisdom in Teman? has wisdom perished from those of
understanding? is their wisdom \[all\] poured out? [Jer
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008.md). Flee, turn ye! hide yourselves,
ye inhabitants of Dedan; for I bring the destruction of Esau upon him,
the time \[when\] I visit him. [Jer
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#009.md). If grape-gatherers come to thee,
they will not leave gleanings; if thieves by night, they destroy what
suffices them. [Jer 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#010.md). For I have
stripped Esau, I have uncovered his secret places, and he cannot cover
himself; his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbours,
and he is not. [Jer 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#011.md). Leave thine
orphans, I will keep them alive; and let thy widows trust me. [Jer
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012.md). For thus saith Jahveh: Behold,
they whose judgment was not to drink the cup shall certainly drink it:
and art thou he \[who\] shall be quite unpunished? thou shalt not be
unpunished, but shalt certainly drink. [Jer
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md). For by myself have I sworn,
saith Jahveh, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a
waste, and a curse; and all its cities shall become everlasting wastes."

In order to frighten Edom out of his carnal security, the prophet begins
by depicting the horror of the judgment coming down on this people,
before which his wise men shall stand not knowing what to advise, and
unable to find out any means for averting the evil. Teman, the home of
the wise Eliphaz ([Job 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011).md), is here,
as in [Amo 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md), [Oba
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#009.md), the region of that name in
Gebalene, the northern district of Idumea; see on [Amo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md). The question, "Is there no
longer wisdom in Teman?" is ironical, and has a negative meaning. The
following clauses also are to be taken as questions, not as assent to
the question, as Hitzig and Graf infer from the omission of בּנים אם is
not the plural of בּן, "son," but the participle of בּוּן fo elpici or
בּין, and equivalent to נבנים; cf. [Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014.md).

[Jer 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008.md)

The Dedanites, whose caravans march in peace through Edom (see on [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023).md), must flee, and hide themselves
in deeply concealed hiding-places, in order to escape the evil befalling
Edom. The form הפנוּ, which only occurs besides in [Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md), in the sense of being "turned,
directed," is here preferred to the Hiphil (cf. [Jer
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#024.md), [Jer
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#021), etc..md), in order to indicate the
constraint under which they must change their route. העמיקוּ is also an
imperative, in spite of the Segol in the first syllable, which is found
there, in some forms, instead of a; cf. Ewald, 226, a. העמיקוּ לשׁבת,
"make deep to stay," i.e., withdraw yourselves into deep or hidden
places, where the enemy does not see and discover you. "For the
destruction of Esau," i.e., the destruction determined on Esau, or Edom,
"I bring on him;" on this matter, cf. [Eze
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#021.md).

[Jer 49:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#009.md)

[Jer 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#009.md) is a reproduction of [Oba
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#005.md), but in such a way that what
Obadiah brings forward as a comparison is directly applied by Jeremiah
to the enemy: our prophet represents the enemy as grape-gatherers who
leave nothing to glean, and as nocturnal thieves who destroy what is
sufficient for them, i.e., destroy till they have enough, drag away and
destroy as much as they can. The after-clauses, "they will not leave,"
etc., "they destroy," etc., are thus not to be taken as questions. The
reference to Obadiah does not entitle us to supply הלוא from that
passage. The connection here is somewhat different. The following verse
is joined by means of כּי, "for;" and the thought, "for I have stripped
Esau, I have discovered his secret places," shows that the enemy is to
be understood by the grape-gatherers and nocturnal thieves: he will
leave nothing to glean - will plunder all the goods and treasures of
Edom, even those that have been hidden. On this subject, cf. [Oba
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#006.md). חשׂף, "to strip off leaves, make
bare" ([Jer 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#026).md), has been chosen
with a regard to נחפּשׂוּ in Obadiah. ונחבּה לא יוּכל, lit., "and he
hides himself, he will not be able to do it;" i.e., Esau (Edom) tries to
hide himself; he will not be able to do it - he will not remain
concealed from the enemy. There are not sufficient grounds for changing
the perf. נחבּה =נחבּא into the inf. abs. נחבּה, as Ewald and Graf do.
"His seed is destroyed," i.e., his family, the posterity of Esau, the
Edomites, his brethren," the descendants of nations related to the
family, and of others similar who had intermingled with them, as the
Amalekites, [Gen 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012.md), Horites, [Gen
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020.md)., Simeonites, [Ch1
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#042.md), "and his neighbours," the
neighbouring tribes, as Dedan, [Jer
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008.md), Thema and Buz, [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md). "And he is not" is added to
give intensity, as in [Isa 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#007.md); cf.
[Jer 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015.md). The last idea is made more
intensive by [Jer 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#011.md), "Leave your
orphans and widows." Edom is addressed, and the imperative expresses
what must happen. The men of Edom will be obliged to leave their wives
and children, and these will be left behind as widows and orphans,
because the men fall in battle. Yet the Lord will care for them, so that
they shall not perish. In this comfort there is contained a very bitter
truth for the Edomites who hated Jahveh. עזבה is the imperative (Ewald,
228, a), not infinitive (Hitzig); and תּבטחוּ is a rare form of the
jussive for תּבטחנה, as in [Eze 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#007.md);
cf. Ewald, 191, b. Reasons are given for these threats in [Jer
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012.md) and [Jer
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md), first in the thought that Edom
cannot continue to be the only one unpunished, then in the bringing
forward of the solemnly uttered purpose of God. "Those who should not be
compelled to drink." Those meant are the Israelites, who, as the people
of God, ought to have been free from the penal judgment with which the
Lord visits the nations. If, now, these are not left (spared such an
infliction), still less can Edom, as a heathen nation, lay claim to
exemption. By this Jeremiah does not mean to say that nay injustice
befalls the Jews if they are obliged to drink the cup of the wrath of
God, but merely that their having been chosen to be the people of God
does not give them any right to exemption from the judgments of God on
the world, i.e., if they make themselves like the heathen through their
sins and vices. The inf. abs. שׁתו for שׁתה intensifies: "ye shall
(must) drink." The idea is founded on that pervading Jer 25, and there
is use made of the words in [Jer
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029.md). The כּי in [Jer
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md) is mainly dependent on the
clause immediately preceding: "thou shalt certainly drink." On "by
myself have I sworn" cf. [Jer 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#005.md). In
the threat that Edom shall be laid waste there is an accumulation of
words corresponding to the excitement of feeling accompanying an
utterance under solemn oath. חרב is used instead of the more common
חרבּה; cf. [Jer 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md); [Jer
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#022.md), etc. חרבות עולם, as in [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md). Bozrah was at that time the
capital of the Edomites (cf. [Jer
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022).md); it lay south from the Dead
Sea, on the site of the village Buseireh (Little Bozrah), in Jebal,
which is still surrounded by a castle and with ruins of considerable
extent, and is situated on an eminence; see on [Amo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md) and [Gen
36:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#033.md). "And all its cities," i.e., the
rest of the cities of Idumea; cf. וּבנותיה, [Jer
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#002.md).

[Jer 49:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014.md)

The nature and occasion of the judgment decreed. - [Jer
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014.md). "I have heard tidings from
Jahveh, and a messenger has been sent among the nations: Gather
yourselves together, and go against her, and arise to the battle! [Jer
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#015.md). For, behold, I have made thee
small among the nations, despised among men. [Jer
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016.md). Thy terribleness hath deceived
thee, the pride of thy heart, O thou that dwellest in the hiding-places
of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill. Though thou makest thy
nest high like the eagle, thence will I bring thee down, saith Jahveh.
[Jer 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#017.md). And Edom shall become an
astonishment; every passer-by shall be astonished at her, and shall hiss
at all her plagues. [Jer 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018.md). As
\[it was in\] the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, saith Jahveh, no man
shall dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn there."

This judgment will immediately take place. The nations who are to make
Edom small and despised have been already summoned by the Lord to the
war. Jeremiah has taken this idea from [Oba
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001.md), [Oba
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#002.md). The subject in "I have heard" is
the prophet, who has heard the information from Jahveh. In Obadiah is
found the plural, "we have heard," because the prophet includes himself
among the people; this is to show that the news serves as a consolation
to Israel, because Edom shall be punished for his crimes committed
against Judah. This view was not before the mind of Jeremiah; with him
the prevailing representation is, that judgment, from which Edom cannot
be excepted, is passed upon all nations. Therefore he has chosen the
singular, "I have heard." In the succeeding clause the perf. Pual שׁלּח
has been changed into שׁלוּח, as the more usual form. The messenger is
to be considered as having been sent by the Lord for the purpose of
summoning the nations to war, as he actually does in the second
hemistich. The message agrees, in the nature of its contents, with [Oba
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001.md); but Jeremiah has dealt somewhat
freely with its form. The statement with regard to the object of the
war, [Jer 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#015.md), agrees pretty exactly
with [Oba 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#002.md). The account, too, which
is given of the cause of the judgment, i.e., the guilt of Edom arising
from his trusting in the impregnable character of his habitation, is
derived from [Oba 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003.md), [Oba
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004.md). Jeremiah has intensified the idea
by the additional use of תּפלצתּך, but has also made certain limitations
of the expression by omitting some clauses found in Obadiah. The word
just named is ἅπ. λεγ., and has been variously explained. The verb פּלץ
occurs only in [Job 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#006.md), with the
meaning of quaking, trembling; and the noun פּלּצוּת pretty frequently
in the sense of fear, shuddering, horror; further, מפלצת is used in [Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013.md); [Ch2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016.md), of an idol, monster, object of
horror. Hence Rabbinical writers have been inclined to understand תּפלצת
as meaning idolatry; in this they are followed by J. D. Michaelis,
Meier, and Ngelsbach. The last-named writer translates, "Thy monster
(idol) led thee astray." But even though this meaning were better
established from the use of language than it is, yet the mention of
idolatry, or even of an idol, is quite unsuitable in this passage. The
lxx render ἡ παιγνία σου i.e., risus or jocus tuus, Chald. טפשׁוּתך,
"thy folly," - evidently a mere guess from the context. The best
ascertained translation is, "Thy terror," i.e., the terror which thou
dost inspire, or the fear of thee, "hath misled thee, the pride of thine
heart," so that "the pride," etc., forms an apposition to "thy terror."
The combination of the fem. תּפלצתּך with the verb השּׁיא in the masc.
is not decisive against this. Following the example of Schleussner (O
arrogantiam tuam), Hitzig and Graf would take the word as an
exclamation, "Terror to thee! horror on thee!" and thy point for support
to הפכּכם, [Isa 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016.md). But an
exclamation is out of place here, and incompatible with the derivation
of the following words from Obadiah. Since Jeremiah appropriates from
Obadiah the thought, "thy pride hath misled thee," תּפלצתּך may possibly
be meant as a mere intensification of זדוי לבּך. The pride of Edom
increased because the other nations were afraid to make war on him in
his rocky dwelling, so difficult of access. On שׂכני בּחגוי הסּלע, see
on [Oba 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003.md). The succeeding
apposition-clause מרום שׁבתּו, found in Obadiah, is modified by Jeremiah
into תּפשׂי מרום גּבעה otni , "thou that seizest, or holdest (as in [Jer
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#010).md), the height of the hill." In
the expression חגוי there is perhaps implied an allusion to the
rock-city סלע, or Petra, in the Wady Musa (see on [Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007).md), and in מרום גּבעה ni dn another
allusion to Bozrah, which lay on a hill; see on [Jer
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md). On [Jer
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016.md), cf. [Oba
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004.md). Jeremiah has omitted the
hyperbolic addition, "among the stars." In [Jer
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#017.md) and [Jer
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018.md) the devastation of Edom is
further portrayed. On [Jer 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#017.md), cf.
[Jer 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md), [Jer
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038.md); with 17b agrees [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md), almost word for word. The
comparison with Sodom, etc., is a reminiscence from [Deu
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md), and is repeated in the prophecy
concerning Babylon, 50:40; cf. [Isa
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md); [Amo
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011.md). "Her neighbours" are Admah and
Zeboim, [Deu 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md); [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md). The comparison with Sodom is not
so to be understood as if it indicated that Edom shall be destroyed in
the same manner as Sodom; it is merely stated that the land of Edom
shall become a desert waste, like the region of the Dead Sea,
uninhabited, and with no human beings in it; cf. [Jer
49:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#033.md) and [Jer
50:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#040.md).

[Jer 49:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md)

"The execution of the judgment, and fall of Edom. - [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md). "Behold, he shall come up like
a lion from the glory of Jordan, to the dwelling or rock: but in a
moment will I drive him away from her, and will appoint over her him who
is chosen; for who is like me? and who will summon me \[before the
judge\]? and what shepherd shall stand before me? [Jer
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020.md). Therefore hear the counsel of
Jahveh which He hath counselled against Edom, and His purposes which He
has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag
them about, the little ones of the flock; surely he shall lay waste
their dwelling over them. [Jer 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#021.md).
At the noise of their fall the earth trembles; a cry - its noise is
heard in the Red Sea. [Jer 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022.md).
Behold, he shall come like the eagle and dart after \[his prey\], and
spread his wings over Bozrah; and the heart of the mighty men of Edom in
that day shall become like the heart of a woman travailing."

As a lion coming up out of the thicket of reeds at the Jordan (נּאון
היּרדּן, see on [Jer 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005).md) suddenly
attacks a flock, so shall he who executes the judgment attack the
Edomites in their strong habitations, and at once put them to flight.
The foe or general who executes the judgment is here no further pointed
out, as in [Jer 46:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#018.md); [Jer
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#020.md); but he is merely set forth as a
lion, and in [Jer 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022.md) as an eagle
that in its flight darts down on its prey. נוה איתן, pasture or dwelling
of permanence; as איתן is used in [Num
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021.md) of the rocky range of Sinai, so
is it used here of the rocky range of Seir (חגוי הסּלע, [Jer
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016).md). The translation "evergreen
pasture" (Graf, Ngelsbach) cannot be defended; for neither איתן,
"continual, enduring," nor נוה, "pasture-ground, dwelling," includes the
notion of green grass. Quite baseless is the assumption of Hitzig, that
the former word means the "shepherd" as remaining with the flock.
ארגּיעה, "I shall wink," stands for the adverb, "immediately, at once."
מעליה אריצנּוּ, "I will make him (Edom) run," i.e., drive him, "from
it," his habitation (which is construed as fem. ad sensum). Jahveh sends
the lion; Jahveh is not compared with the lion (Hitzig). In מי בּחוּר
the former word is not the interrogative pronoun, but the indefinite
quicunque, as in [Exo 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#014.md); cf.
Ewald, 332, b. And the latter word is not "the valiant shepherd"
(Hitzig), but signifies "chosen." אליה is used instead of עליה; and פּקד
על means to "set over" something, as the chief, superior. The idea is,
that God will frighten away the Edomites out of their land by a lion,
and appoint him as the shepherd whom He chooses for that purpose. None
can prevent this, for there is none like Jahveh in strength or power,
and none can call Him to account for His doing. יעידנּוּ (from יעד), in
Hiphil, to "summon before the court of justice," i.e., to call on one to
make a defence; cf. [Job 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019.md). Nor can
any shepherd stand before Jahveh, i.e., defend his flock. These words
are directed against the rulers of Edom, who foolishly imagined they
were secure, and could not be touched in their rock-fortresses. The
words, moreover, contain general truths, so that we cannot apply בּחוּר
to historical persons, such as Nebuchadnezzar or Alexander the Great.

[Jer 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020.md)

This truth the Edomites are to lay to heart, and to hear, i.e., consider
the purpose which the Lord has formed regarding Edom. Teman is not
synonymous with Edom, but the inhabitants of Teman are specially named
together with Edom in the parallel member, because they were
particularly famous for their wisdom ([Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007).md), and in their pride over this
wisdom, held the counsels of God in very small esteem. The counsel of
God, the thoughts which He has conceived regarding Edom, follow in the
clauses which are introduced with solemn assurance. יסחבוּם is rendered
by the Vulgate, si non dejecerint eos parvuli gregis, which Luther
follows in his translation, "if the shepherd-boys will not drag them
away." And C. B. Michaelis and Hהvernick (on Ezekiel, p. 415) still view
the words as meaning that "the least of the flock" will drag away Edom;
i.e., the covenant people, weak and miserable though they are, will be
victorious over Edom: in support of this rendering they point to [Eze
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#014.md). But though Ezekiel clearly
declares that the Lord will satisfy His revenge on Edom by means of His
people Israel, yet it does not follow from this that Ezekiel had this
passage of Jeremiah in his mind, and sought so to apply it. In spite of
the clearness with which the thought is expressed by Obadiah and
Ezekiel, that Edom will at last become the prey of the people of God, we
would expect to find it in Jeremiah only as a simple inference from his
words; for Jeremiah does not, like Obadiah and Ezekiel, mention the
enmity of Edom to Israel as the cause of his guilt, but only the pride
of his heart. Against taking "the little ones of the flock" as the
subject of the clause, we find these considerations: (1) סחב, "to pull,
drag away," does not well apply to sheep, but rather points to dogs
([Jer 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003).md) or lions, which drag away
their prey. (2) The context is far from leading us to understand, by the
little ones of the sheep, Israel or the people of God, either here or
where the words are repeated, 50:45; while [Zac
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#007.md) and [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md) are passages which cannot be held
as regulating this verse. In [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md) the rulers of Edom are viewed as
shepherds: in accordance with this figure, the Edomites are in [Jer
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020.md) called sheep, and weak, helpless
ones too. The subject of יסחבוּם is indefinite: "the enemy will advance
like a lion out of the jungle of the Jordan;" the suffix precedes the
noun, as in [Jer 48:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#044.md), etc. The fate
of Edom will be so terrible, that their pasture-ground, their habitation
will be astonished at it. The Hiphil ישּׁים is formed, like נשּׁים in
[Num 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020.md), from שׁמם; not, however,
with the sense of "laying waste," which the construction with על of a
person does not suit, but with the meaning of "making astonished," as in
[Eze 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#010.md), and only here with the
directly causative sense of manifesting, showing astonishment or
amazement.

[Jer 49:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#021.md)

The fall of Edom will be so fearful, that the earth will tremble, and
the cry of anguish from the perishing people will be heard on the Red
Sea. נפלם is the inf. Kal with suffix. The threatening concludes, in
[Jer 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022.md), with the same though
through which destruction is threatened to the Moabites, [Jer
48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040.md). The comparison of the enemy to
an eagle is continued in the expression, "he shall come up;" the coming
up, however, does not mean the rising of the eagle into the air, but
refers to the enemy: to march as an enemy against Edom.

With reference to the fulfilment of this prophecy, we have already
pointed out, on [Num 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018.md), and at the
close of the exposition in Obadiah, that the threatened devastation of
the land of Edom was brought about by the Chaldeans, as is clear from
[Mal 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003.md); but the annihilation of the
people was commenced by the Maccabeans, and completed by the Romans,
about the time of the Jewish war.

[Jeremiah 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 49:23</span></span>

Concerning Damascus. - Aram, on this side of the Euphrates, or Syria,
was divided, in the times of Saul and David, into the kingdoms of
Damascus, Zobah, and Hamath, of which the second, extending between
Damascus and Hamath (see on [Sa2 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003).md),
or situated north-eastward from Damascus, between the Orontes and the
Euphrates, was the most powerful; its kings were defeated by Saul ([Sa1
14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047).md), and afterwards conquered and
made tributary to the kingdom of Israel by David, who did the same to
the Syrians of Damascus that had come to the assistance of Hadadezer
king of Zobah (2 Sam 8 and 10). After the death of David and during the
time of Solomon, a freebooter named Rezon, who had broken away from
Hadadezer during the war, established himself in Damascus (see on [Kg1
11:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023).md), and became the founder of a
dynasty which afterwards made vassals of all the smaller kings of Syria,
whose number is given [Kg1 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001.md). This
dynasty also, under the powerful rulers Benhadad I and II and Hazael,
long pressed hard on the kingdom of Israel, and conquered a great part
of the Israelite territory ([Kg1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018.md)., [Jer
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md)., [Jer
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003.md).; [Kg2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md)., [Jer
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#008.md)., 8:28f., 10:32f., 12:18ff., [Jer
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#003)..md). At last, King Joash, after the
death of Hazael, succeeded in retaking the conquered cities from his
son, Benhadad III ([Kg2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#019)..md); and
Jeroboam II was able to restore the ancient frontiers of Israel as far
as Hamath ([Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md). Some decades
alter, Rezin king of Damascus, in alliance with Pekah of Israel,
undertook a war of conquest against Judah during the time of Ahaz, who
therefore called to his aid the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser. This
monarch conquered Damascus, and put an end to the Syrian kingdom, by
carrying away the people to Kir ([Kg2
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037.md); [Kg2
16:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005).md). This kingdom of Syria is
called "Damascus" in the prophets, after its capital. We find threats of
destruction and ruin pronounced against it even by such early prophets
as Amos ([Amo 1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003).md), for its cruelty
committed against Israel, and Isaiah ([Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001)..md), because of its having combined
with Israel to destroy Judah. According to the use of language just
referred to, "Damascus," mentioned in the heading of this prophecy, is
not the city, but the kingdom of Syria, which has been named after its
capital, and to which, besides Damascus, belonged the powerful cities of
Hamath and Arpad, wxich formerly had kings of their own ([Isa
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#013).md). Jeremiah does not mention any
special offence. In the judgment to come on all nations, Aram-Damascus
cannot remain exempt.

[Jer 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023.md)

"Hamath is ashamed, and Arpad, for they have heard evil tidings: they
despair; there is trouble on the sea; no one can rest. [Jer
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#024.md). Damascus has become
discouraged, she has turned to flee: terror has seized her; distress and
pains have laid hold on her, like a woman in childbirth. [Jer
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#025.md). How is the city of praise not
left, the city of my delight? [Jer
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#026.md). Therefore shall her young men
fall in her streets, and all the man of war shall be silent in that day,
saith Jahveh of hosts. [Jer 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#027.md). And
I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the
palaces of Benhadad."

The largest cities of Aram are seized with consternation and
discouragement. Damascus would flee, but its men of war fall by the
sword of the enemy, and the city is in flames. The description of the
terror which overpowers the inhabitants of Aram begins with Hamath
(Epiphaneia of the Greeks, now called Hamah), which lies north from Hums
(Emesa), on the Orontes (el 'Asi); see on [Gen
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#017.md) and [Num
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008.md). Arpad is always mentioned in
connection with Hamath ([Isa 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009.md);
[Isa 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#019.md); [Isa
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#013.md); [Kg2
18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#034.md) and [Kg2
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#013).md): in the list of Assyrian
synonyms published by Oppert and Schrader, it is sounded Arpadda; and
judging by the name, it still remains in the large village of Arfd,
mentioned by Maras., about fifteen miles north from Haleb (Aleppo); see
on [Kg2 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#034.md). The bad news which
Hamath and Arpad have heard is about the approach of a hostile army.
"She is ashamed," i.e., disappointed in her hope and trust (cf. [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013).md), with the accessory idea of
being confounded. נמוג, to be fainthearted from fear and anxiety; cf.
[Jos 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md), [Jos
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#024.md); [Exo
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015.md), etc. There is a difficulty with
the expression בּים, from the mention of the sea. Ewald has therefore
invented a new word, בּי, which is stated to signify mind, heart; and he
translates, "their heart is in trouble." Graf very rightly remarks,
against this, that there was no occasion whatever for the employment of
a word which occurs nowhere else. The simplest explanation is that of J.
D. Michaelis, Rosenmller, and Maurer: "on the sea," i.e., onwards to the
sea, "anxiety prevails." The objection of Graf, that on this view there
is no nominative to יוּכל, cannot make this explanation doubtful,
because the subject (Ger. man, Fr. on, Eng. people, they) is easily
obtained from the context. The words השׁקט לא יוּכל form a reminiscence
from [Isa 57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020.md), where they are used
of the sea when stirred up, to which the wicked are compared. But it
does not follow from this that the words are to be understood in this
passage also of the sea, and to be translated accordingly: "in the sea
there is no rest," i.e., the sea itself is in ceaseless motion (Hitzig);
or with a change of בּים into כּים, "there is a tumult like the sea,
which cannot keep quiet" (Graf). As little warrant is there for
concluding, from passages like [Jer
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012.md)., where the surging of the
Assyrian power is compared to the roaring of the waves of the sea, that
the unrest of the inhabitants of Syria, who are in a state of anxious
solicitude, is here compared to the restless surging and roaring of the
sea (Umbreit). For such a purpose, דּאגה, "concern, solicitude," is much
too weak, or rather inappropriate.

[Jer 49:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#024.md)

רפתה דמּשׁק, "Damascus has become slack," i.e., discouraged; she turns
to flee, and cannot escape, being seized with trembling and anxiety.
החזיקה is not the third pers. fem., prehendit terrorem, but stands for
החזיקהּ, with Mappik omitted, because the tone is retracted in
consequence of the Athnach; cf. [Jer
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024.md); [Jer
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#021.md), etc. "Terror has seized
Damascus." In the last clause וחבלים is subsumed along with צרה; hence
the verb is put in the singular. - [Jer
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#025.md). The question, "How is not,"
etc., has been differently explained. Eichhorn, Gesenius, Ewald, and
Umbreit take the words according to the German usage, in the sense, "How
is the city forsaken?" or laid waste. But this Germanism is foreign to
the Hebrew; and it is not obviated by C. B. Michaelis taking "how" in
the sense of quam inopinato et quam horribiliter non deserta est, so
that the words would mean nullus est modus desertionis aut gradus quem
Damascus non sit experta, because איך לא does not express the kind and
manner, or the degree of an action. In the only other passage where איך
לא occurs ([Sa2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#014).md) the negative has
its full meaning. Others (Calvin, Schnurrer, J. D. Michaelis,
Rosenmller, Maurer) take עזב in the sense of leaving free, untouched:
"How has she not been left untouched?" i.e., been spared. But this
meaning of the verb is nowhere found. There is no other course left
than, with Ngelsbach, to take the verb as referring to the desertion of
the city through the flight of the inhabitants, as in [Jer
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029.md), etc., and to take the words
thus: "How is (i.e., how has it happened that) the famous city (is) not
forsaken?" According to this view, it is not the desolation of the city
that is bewailed, but the fact that the inhabitants have not saved their
lives by flight. The way is prepared for this thought by [Jer
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#024.md), where it is said that the
inhabitants of Damascus wish to flee, but are seized with convulsive
terror; in [Jer 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#025.md) also there is a
more specific reason given for it, where it is stated that the youths
(the young warriors) and all the men of war shall fall in the streets of
the city, and be slain by foes. The suffix in "my delight" refers to the
prophet, and expresses his sympathy for the fall of the glorious city
(see on [Jer 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#031).md); because not only
does its population perish, but the city itself also ([Jer
49:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#027).md) is to be burned to ashes.

[Jer 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#027.md)

[Jer 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#027.md) has been imitated from [Amo
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004.md) and [Jer
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014.md) conjointly. בּחמת, not "on," but
"in," i.e., "within the wall." "The palaces of Benhadad" are the palaces
of the Syrian kings generally, because three kings of Damascus bore this
name.

The fulfilment of this threat cannot be proved historically, from want
of information. Since Pharaoh-Necho had conquered Syria as far as the
Euphrates, it is very possible that, after the defeat of the Egyptians
at Carchemish, in the conquest of Syria by Nebuchadnezzar, Damascus was
harshly treated. The prophecy is, however, so general in its statement,
that we need not confine its fulfilment to the conquest by
Nebuchadnezzar.

[Jeremiah 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 49:28</span></span>

"Concerning Kedar and the Kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar the
king of Babylon smote." (The Kethib נבוּכדראצּור is perhaps merely an
error in transcription occasioned by the occurrence of the preceding
חצור). Kedar, the Kedarenes, a Bedouin nation descended from Ishmael,
dwelling in tents throughout the region between Arabia Petraea and
Babylonia (see on [Gen 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#013.md) and [Eze
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#021).md), is here, no doubt, a general
name for all the nomadic tribes and shepherd nations of Arabia. Hazor
elsewhere occurs only as the name of various cities in Palestine ([Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md); [Jos
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#023.md), [Jos
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#025.md); [Jos
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#023); Nah. 11:33.md), of which we need
not think here, since it is Arabians who are spoken of. No locality or
region of this name in Arabia is known. Jeremiah appears to have formed
the name for the purpose of designating those Arabians who dwelt in
חצרים, "courts" or "villages," and who thus differed from the Bedouins
proper, or nomads and dwellers in tents; cf. [Isa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011.md) with [Gen
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#016.md). The settled Arabians are to
this day called Hadarijeh, in contrast with Wabarijeh, who dwell in
tents. "Hadar, חצר, is the settled dwelling-place, in contrast with
bedû, the steppe, where the tents are pitched, sometimes here, sometimes
there, and only for a time" (Delitzsch on [Isa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011).md). "The kingdoms of Hazor" are
the regions of the settled tribes, ruled by their own princes or sheiks;
cf. [Jer 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024.md).

(Note: According to Mrc. v. Niebuhr, Gesch. Ass. u. Bab. p. 210, "Hazor
is the modern Hajar, a region which occupies the whole north-eastern
corner of the Nejed, and to which, in the wider sense, Lascha, the
region on the coast, also belongs" But חצור, from חצר, which corresponds
to Arab. htsr or hdr, is fundamentally different from Arab. hjr or ḥjr.)

In the prophecy, the general designation, "children of the east," i.e.,
Orientals, alternates with Kedar: the former is the most common name
given to the tribes living to the east of Palestine, in the wilderness:
cf. [Jdg 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003.md); [Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003.md); [Eze
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md). Instead of this name, Josephus
uses the designation "Arabians" (Ant. [Eze
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006). 1.md); later, "Nabateans" or
"Kedarenes" became common. Here also ([Jer
49:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#032).md) is used the special designation
קצוּצי פאה cut (at) the corner (of the hair), which points to the
custom, usual among several of these Bedouin tribes, of cropping the
hair of the head and beard; see on [Jer
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#025.md) and [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md).

[Jer 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md)

"Thus saith Jahveh, Arise, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of
the east. [Jer 49:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#029.md). Their tents and
their flocks shall they take: their curtains, and all their vessels, and
their camels shall they carry away for themselves; and they shall cry
over them, Fear is on every side. [Jer
49:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#030.md). Flee! wander far, dwell deep,
ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jahveh; for Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath devised a plan against
them. [Jer 49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031.md). Arise! go up against
a nation at ease, dwelling carelessly, saith Jahveh; it has no gates nor
bars - they dwell alone. [Jer 49:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#032.md).
And their camels shall be a prey, and the multitude of their herds a
spoil; and I will scatter them to every wind who have cut the corner
\[of their beards\], and from all sides will I bring their destruction,
saith Jahveh. [Jer 49:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#033.md). And Hazor
shall be an habitation of jackals, a desolation for ever. No man shall
dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn in it."

This prophecy consists of two brief strophes, which begin with a summons
to the army of the enemy to wage war on the Arabians ([Jer
49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md) and [Jer
49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031).md), and then announce the
execution of this order; the arrangement, moreover, is such that there
is attached to the first strophe a summons to the Arabians to save
themselves by flight ([Jer 49:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#030).md),
while the other concludes with the threat that their territory shall be
destroyed ([Jer 49:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#033).md).

[Jer 49:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md)

עלה is used with אל instead of על, to signify hostile advance against a
nation or city. שׁדדוּ with Qametz-Hatuph (without Metheg) is
imperative; cf. Ewald, 227, i, with 251, c. The verbs יקּחוּ and ישׂאוּ
in [Jer 49:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#029.md) are not jussives (Ewald,
Umbreit, etc.), but imperfects, describing what takes place in
consequence of the order given. Tents and flocks of sheep and goats,
curtains and vessels, together with camels, form the property and wealth
of the nomads. נשׂא, to take away, carry off; להם, sibi. They call out
over them, as if it were a watch-cry, "Horror around:" on this
expression, see [Jer 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025.md). This
justifies the call addressed to them, "Flee," etc. To נסוּ is added נדוּ
for the purpose of intensifying, and this again is further strengthened
by appending מאד: "Use every effort to flee." העמיקוּ as in [Jer
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008.md). A reason is given for the
summons, in the statement that Nebuchadnezzar, as the instrument of
Jahveh, has formed a plan against them; cf. [Jer
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020.md) and [Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md). Instead of עליהם, many MSS and
the ancient versions have עליכם, in conformity with the first member. In
all probability, the original reading is "against them," inasmuch as
"the discourse, as in other instances, makes a transition, in the last
portion, from direct address to a calmer style of speaking" (Ewald).

[Jer 49:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031.md)

[Jer 49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031.md) does not declare the plan
of the king of Babylon; but the words, "Arise, go ye up," etc., are once
more the summons of the Lord, as is shown by the expression "saith
Jahveh." The enemy is to march against a peaceful nation, dwelling
securely, that has neither doors nor bars, i.e., does not live in cities
surrounded by walls with gates and bars (cf. [Sa1
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#007.md); [Deu
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#005).md), whose territory, therefore, is
easily conquered. They dwell alone, apart from others, without
connection and intercourse with other nations, from which they could
obtain help and support. שׁליו, like זעיר, [Job
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#002.md); [Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md), is a Chaldaizing form; elsewhere
it is written שׁליו, [Job 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#023.md), or
שׁלו, [Job 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#012.md). As to living
securely, cf. [Jdg 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md); [Eze
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#011.md); on living alone, 15:17. This
last is elsewhere said only of Israel, [Num
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md); [Deu
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md). Their possessions will become
the spoil of the enemy; God will scatter them to every wind (cf. [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012.md); [Eze
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#014).md), and bring destruction on them
from every side (on עבריו, cf. [Kg1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#004).md).

[Jer 49:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#033.md)

The dwelling-places of the settled tribes (Hazor) shall become the
habitation of jackals (cf. [Jer 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010).md),
an uninhabited desolation for ever. [Jer
49:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#033.md) is in part a repetition of [Jer
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018.md).

With regard to the fulfilment of this prophecy, it follows from the
latter part of the title that Nebuchadnezzar had smitten the Arabian
tribes, i.e., defeated them, and subjected them to his sway. But we have
no historical information as to the time when this took place. M. von
Niebuhr (Gesch. Assyr. u. Bab. S. 209) and Duncker (Gesch. d. Alterth.
i. S. 427) suppose that Nebuchadnezzar, after he had returned home to
Babylon from Hither Asia, having heard of the death of his father, after
his victory at Carchemish, and after he had ascended the throne, "as it
seems," first thought of extending his authority over the Arabians on
the lower portion of the Euphrates, in North Arabia, and in the Syrian
desert. This supposition may possibly be true, but cannot be raised to
historic probability; moreover, it is connected, by the above-mentioned
historians, with theories regarding the campaigns against Hither Asia
which rest upon statements of Josephus that are very uncertain, and some
of which can be proved to be incorrect. Such is the statement in Antt.
x. 6. 1, that Nebuchadnezzar, after his victory at Carchemish, in
pursuing the Egyptians to the borders of their country, did not touch
Judea. The only notice we have, apart from Scripture, of the conquest of
Arabia by Nebuchadnezzar, is that furnished by Josephus (contra Ap. i.
19) from Berosus: κρατῆσαι δέ φησί τὸν Βαβυλώνιον (i.e., Nebuchadnezzar)
Αἰγύπτου Συρίας Φοινίκης ̓Αραβίας. But this notice is stated in such
indefinite and general terms, that nothing more specific can be inferred
from it regarding the time and circumstances of the conquest of
Arabians.

[Jeremiah 49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 49:34</span></span>

Concerning Elam. - By the title (on the form of which, cf. [Jer
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md); [Jer
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md), and [Jer
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001).md), the utterance regarding Elam is
placed "in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah;" hence
it was published later than the prophecies in Jer 48 and in 49:1-33, and
not long before the prophecy regarding Babylon in Jer 50. Elam, a
Shemitic people in Elymais, the Persian province of Susiana (the modern
Husistn), which, except in [Gen 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md),
only appears in history when it had no longer a Shemitic but an Aryan
language (see on [Gen 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#022.md) and [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002).md), is mentioned in [Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006.md) as serving in the Assyrian army,
and in [Isa 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006.md) as being, together
with Madai (the Medes), the executors of judgment against Babylon. That
Elam still belonged, in the time of Esarhaddon, to the kingdom of
Assyria, follows from [Ezr 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#009.md), where
Elamites are mentioned among the colonists whom this Assyrian king
transplanted into the depopulated kingdom of the ten tribes. But whether
Elam, after the revolt of Media, also made itself independent of
Assyria, or remained subject to this kingdom till it fell, we have no
historical data to determine. The same must be said regarding the
question whether, after the fall of Nineveh and the destruction of the
Assyrian kingdom by the united armies of Nabopolassar from Babylon and
Cyaxares from Media, Elam was incorporated with the Median or the
Babylonian kingdom; for nothing more specific has been transmitted to us
regarding the division of the conquered kingdom among the two victors.
Judging from its geographical situation, we must probably come to the
conclusion that Elam fell to the lot of the Medes. Seeing that there is
an utter want, in other respects, of facts regarding the earlier history
of Elam, neither can a historical occasion be made out for this
prophecy. The supposition of Ewald, "that the wild and warlike Elamites
([Isa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006).md) had shortly before taken
part with the Chaldeans as their allies in the deposition of Jehoiachin
and the first great exile of the people, and had therein shown
themselves particularly cruel," has no support of any kind, either in
the contents of the prophecy or in the time when it was composed. The
prophecy itself contains not the slightest indication of any hostility
on the part of the Elamites towards Judah; nor is anything proved
regarding this by the fact that the chastisement is not said to proceed
from Nebuchadnezzar, but directly from Jahveh, since, in the oracles
concerning Philistia, Edom, and Damascus also, Nebuchadnezzar is not
mentioned, but Jahveh is named as the one who destroys these peoples and
burns up their cities; cf. [Jer 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004.md);
[Jer 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#010.md), [Jer
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md)., 27. Add to this, that the
assumption of Elamites being in Nebuchadnezzar's army is devoid of
historic probability, since Elam, as has already been stated, hardly
belonged to the Chaldean kingdom.

(Note: No valid reason has been adduced for calling in question the
statement in the title regarding the time when this prophecy was
composed; yet this has been done by Movers, Hitzig, and Ngelsbach. "That
the lxx have given the heading twice, the first time briefly, and then
fully at the end of the piece, merely shows that two different readings
have now been combined in it" (Ewald). And Ngelsbach has yet to bring
proof of the assurance given us when he says, "I consider it quite
impossible that Jeremiah, in the beginning of Zedekiah's reign, should
have thought of any other than Nebuchadnezzar as the instrument to be
employed in executing judgment, or that he should even have left this
matter in suspenso." If Jeremiah, as a prophet of the Lord, does not
announce, as the word of Jahveh, mere human conjectures regarding the
future, but only what the Spirit of the Lord suggested to him, neither
could he set forth his own conjectures regarding the question by whom
God the Lord was to scatter the Elamites to the four winds, but must
leave it in suspenso, if the Spirit of the Lord had revealed nothing to
him regarding it.)

[Jer 49:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#035.md)

"Thus saith Jahveh of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the
chief part of their strength. [Jer
49:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#036.md). And I will bring upon Elam four
winds from the four ends of the heaven, and I will scatter them towards
all these winds; and there shall be no nation where the scattered ones
of Elam shall not come. [Jer 49:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#037.md).
And I will make Elam terrified before their enemies, and before those
who seek their life; and I will bring on them evil, the heat of my
wrath, saith Jahveh; and I will send after them the sword, until I
consume them. [Jer 49:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#038.md). And I will
place my throne in Elam, and will destroy thence king and princes, saith
Jahveh. [Jer 49:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#039.md). But it shall be in
the end of the days, that I will turn the captivity of Elam, saith
Jahveh."

Elam's martial power is to be destroyed, and its population scattered to
the four winds among all nations ([Jer
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#025)..md). The Lord will make them
terrified before their enemies, and let them be pursued by the sword
till they are swept away ([Jer 49:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#037).md).
In the country itself He will hold a tribunal, and destroy king and
priests out of it ([Jer 49:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#038).md). In
[Jer 49:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#035.md), the bow, as the chief
weapon of the Elamites (cf. [Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006).md), is mentioned, by synecdoche,
instead of all offensive and defensive weapons, for all the means of
resistance and attack employed by this warlike nation. This, indeed, is
shown by the apposition, "the first-fruits (i.e., the chief part) of
their strength" or valour. To break the bow in pieces is thus equivalent
to rendering defenceless. The plural suffix in גּבוּרתם points to Elam
as a nation - the Elamites. Hitzig, Graf, and older expositors make an
assumption which is both unnecessary and incapable of proof, that קשׁת
stands for גבּורים, and means "the valiant, brave people of war," as in
[Isa 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#017.md) and [Sa1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#004.md); but neither in these passages can
the alleged meaning be fully made out.

[Jer 49:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#036.md)

Through the working of God's power, the Elamites shall be dispersed to
all the four winds, i.e., to all parts of the earth. This exercise of
power is represented under the figure of the four winds. The wind is the
most appropriate among all earthly things for symbolizing the Spirit of
God, or the energy of the divine operation; cf. [Zac
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005.md); [Dan
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002.md). The Kethib עולם in [Jer
49:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#036.md) has evidently been written by
mistake for עילם. The meaning of the figure is this: Elam is to be
attacked on all sides by enemies, and be scattered in every direction.
This is evident from [Jer 49:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#037.md), where
the figurative is changed for the literal, and the thought further
extended. החתּתּי, Hiphil from חתת, be broken to pieces, in Hiphil to
dispirit through fear and terror; cf. [Jer
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#017.md). On the form of the text, which
is shortened from החתּותי through the shifting of the tone to the last
syllable, cf. Ewald, 234, e. רעה, "evil, misfortune," is marked by the
apposition, "the heat of mine anger," as the emanation of God's judgment
of wrath. On 37b, cf. [Jer 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015.md). The
Lord will sit in judgment on king and princes, and punish them with
death. The throne is set for the Judge to sit in judgment; see [Jer
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010.md). Yet ([Jer
49:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#039).md), in the Messianic future,
blessing shall come on Elam; cf. [Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md); [Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md).

If we compare this prophecy with the remaining prophecies of Jeremiah
regarding the heathen nations, we shall find that it contains no
reference whatever to any execution by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon of
the judgment with which the Elamites are threatened; but it announces
the fall of Elam and the dispersion of its inhabitants by enemies in a
way so general, that, as Hvernick (on Daniel, p. 549) has remarked, it
is an arbitrary addition for any one to make, if he thinks definitely of
the Chaldeans as the enemies of Elam, because, correctly viewed, the
contents rather declare against a conquest by Nebuchadnezzar.
"Jeremiah," says Hvernick, "announces the utter extinction of the state
as such, a general dispersion and annihilation of the people, a tribunal
of punishment which the Lord Himself will hold over them, - features
which are far too strongly marked, and far too grand, to let us think
that Elam is merely to be rendered tributary and incorporated into a new
state. If we connect with this the deliverance of Elam mentioned at the
close of [Jer 49:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#039.md), viz., his
conversion, then we will not hesitate to take the meaning of the oracle,
in a more general way, as referring to the gradual fall of this heathen
nation, for which, however, a future deliverance is in store, as is
fully shown by the issue." This view is at least much more correct than
the current tone, still maintained by Ewald, Hitzig, Graf, etc.,
according to which the prophecy refers to a conquest of Elam by
Nebuchadnezzar. M. von Niebuhr (Gesch. Assyr. und Bab. S. 210) attempts
to show its probability from a notice in Strabo (xi. 524), and (on S.
212) from the intimation given in the book of Judith, Jer 1, of a war
between Nebuchadnezzar and Media, which was successfully concluded in
the twelfth year of his reign. But the statement in Strabo, that the
Kossaites, a nation of robbers, once sent 13,000 archers to help the
Elamites against the Susites and Babylonians, is far too indefinite for
us to be able to apply it to a war which Nebuchadnezzar in company with
Media carried on against Elam; for the Susites are at least not Medes.
And the notice in the book of Judith is self-evidently unhistorical; for
it says that Nebuchadnezzar was king of the Assyrians and resided in the
great city of Nineveh, and that he defeated Arphaxad the king of Media
in the seventeenth year of his reign (Judith 1:1, 13). But
Nebuchadnezzar neither resided in Nineveh, which had been destroyed
shortly before; nor could he have made war on Arphaxad king of Media in
the seventeenth year of his reign, because he had in that year begun to
besiege Jerusalem with all his forces. But the additional considerations
which Niebuhr brings forward in support of his hypothesis can as little
stand the test. Neither [Jer 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#025.md),
where the kings of Media and Elam are mentioned among those who are to
drink the cup of wrath, nor [Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md)., where Elam and the whole
multitude of its people are brought forward as among those who were
slain, and who sank into the nether parts of the earth, furnish proofs
of the conquest and destruction of Elam by Nebuchadnezzar, or of a war
between that king and Media. For the funeral-song in Ezekiel bears a
thoroughly ideal character, and announces the fall of all the heathen
powers, without any regard to Nebuchadnezzar. This holds, too, in a
sense, of Jer 25, where Nebuchadnezzar is certainly mentioned as the
ruler into whose power all the nations are to be delivered for the space
of seventy years, inasmuch as this announcement also launches out into
the idea of a judgment of all nations; so that we are not entitled to
assume that all the kingdoms of the earth, to whom the cup of wrath is
presented, were to be conquered and brought under subjection by
Nebuchadnezzar. Still less reason is there for inferring from [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md), that Nebuchadnezzar was involved
in a war with Media at a time when, as is there stated, at the beginning
of Zedekiah's reign, the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, and Phoenicia sent
ambassadors to Jerusalem to recommend a coalition against the power of
Babylon. Even if Nebuchadnezzar were then occupied in the eastern
portion of his kingdom, yet there is nothing at all to prove that he was
involved in war with Media or Elam. History says nothing of a war waged
by Nebuchadnezzar on Elam, nor does this prophecy furnish any support
for such an assumption. Although it does not set before us a "gradual
ruin" of Elam (Hvernick), but rather a catastrophe brought on by God,
yet the description is given in terms so general, that nothing more
specific can be inferred from it regarding the time and the
circumstances of this catastrophe. In this prophecy, Elam is not
considered in its historical relation to the people of Israel, but as
the representative of the heathen world lying beyond, which has not
hitherto come into any relation towards the people of Israel, but which
nevertheless, along with it, falls under the judgment coming on all
nations, in order that, through the judgment, it may be led to the
knowledge of the true God, and share in His salvation.
