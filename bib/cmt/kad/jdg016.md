### [Judges Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 16:0</span></span>

Samson's Fall and Death. - Samson's judicial labours reached their
highest point when he achieved his great victory over the Philistines at
Lechi. Just as his love to the daughter of a Philistine had furnished
him with the occasion designed by God for the manifestation of his
superiority to the uncircumcised enemies of Israel, so the degradation
of that love into sensual lust supplied the occasion for his fall which
is related in this chapter. "Samson, when strong and brave, strangled a
lion; but he could not strangle his own love. He burst the fetters of
his foes, but not the cords of his own lusts. He burned up the crops of
others, and lost the fruit of his own virtue when burning with the flame
enkindled by a single woman." (Ambros. Apol. ii., David. c. iii.)

[Judges 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 16:1</span></span>

His Heroic Deed at Gaza. - Samson went to Gaza in the full consciousness
of his superiority in strength to the Philistines, and there went in
unto a harlot whom he saw. For Gaza, see [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md). אל כּוא is used in the same
sense as in [Gen 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004.md) and [Gen
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#016.md). It is not stated in this
instance, as in [Jdg 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#004.md), that it was
of the Lord.

[Jdg 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#002.md)

When this was told to the Gazites, they surrounded him (the object to
the verb is to be supplied from the following word לו) and laid wait for
him all night at the city gate, but they kept themselves quiet during
the night, saying, "Till the dawning (אור, infin.) of the morning," sc.,
we can wait, "then will we kill him." For this construction, see [Sa1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#022.md). The verb ויּגּד, "it was told"
(according to the lxx and Chald.: cf. [Gen
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#020).md), or ויּאמרוּ, "they said," is
wanting before לעזּתים, and must have fallen out through a copyist's
error. The verb התחרשׁ has evidently the subordinate idea of giving
themselves up to careless repose; for if the watchmen who were posted at
the city gate had but watched in a regular manner, Samson could not have
lifted out the closed gates and carried them away. But as they supposed
that he would not leave the harlot before daybreak, they relied upon the
fact that the gate was shut, and probably feel asleep.

[Jdg 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#003.md)

But at midnight Samson got up, and "laying hold of the folding wings of
the city, gate, as well as the two posts, tore them out of the ground
with his herculean strength, together with the bar that fastened them,
and carried them up to the top of the mountain which stands opposite to
Hebron." על־פּני merely means in the direction towards, as in [Gen
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#016.md), and does not signify that the
mountain was in the front of Hebron or in the immediate neighbourhood
(see [Deu 32:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#049.md), where Mount Nebo,
which was on the other side of the Jordan, and at least four
geographical miles from Jericho, is said to have been over against, it,
and the same expression is employed). The distance from Gaza to Hebron
was about nine geographical miles. To the east of Gaza there is a range
of hills which runs from north to south. The highest of them all is one
which stands somewhat isolated, about half an hour to the south-east of
the town, and is called el Montar from a wely which is found upon the
top of it. From this hill there is a splendid prospect over the whole of
the surrounding country. Hebron itself is not visible from this hill,
but the mountains of Hebron are. According to an ancient tradition, it
was to the summit of this hill that Samson carried the city gates; and
both Robinson (Pal. ii. 377) and V. de Velde regard this tradition as by
no means improbable, although the people of Gaza are not acquainted with
it. "The city gate of the Gaza of that time was probably not less than
three-quarters of an hour from the hill el Montar; and to climb this
peak with the heavy gates and their posts and bar upon his shoulders
through the deep sand upon the road, was a feat which only a Samson
could perform" (V. de Velde).

[Judges 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 16:4</span></span>

Samson and Delilah. - [Jdg 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#004.md). After
this successful act, Samson gave himself up once more to his sensual
lusts. He fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, named
Delilah (i.e., the weak or pining one), to whose snares he eventually
succumbed. With reference to the valley of Sorek, Eusebius affirms in
the Onom. (s. v. Σωρήχ), that there was a village called Βαρήχ (l. Καφὰρ
σωρήχ according to Jerome) near Zorea, and ἐν ὁρίοις (l. βορείοις
according to Jerome, who has ad septentrionalem plagam); and also (s. v.
Σωρήκ) that this place was near to Eshtaol. Consequently the Sorek
valley would have to be sought for somewhere in the neighbourhood of
Samson's birthplace ([Jdg 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001).md), and
the dwelling-place of his family ([Jdg
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#031).md).

[Jdg 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#005.md)

The princes of the Philistines offered Delilah a considerable sum (they
would give her one thousand and one hundred shekels of silver each,
i.e., a thousand shekels or more: cf. [Jdg
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#002).md) if she would persuade Samson,
and bring out from him "whereby his strength was great," and whereby
they could overpower and bind him, לענּותו, to bend him, i.e., to
oppress him. The Philistine princes thought that Samson's supernatural
strength arose from something external, which he wore or carried about
with him as an amulet. There was a certain truth at the foundation of
this heathen superstition, inasmuch as this gift of divine grace was
really bound up with the possession of a corporeal pledge, the loss of
which was followed by the immediate loss of the gift of God (see at [Jdg
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017).md).

[Jdg 16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#006.md)

Allured by the reward in prospect, Delilah now sought to get from him
the secret of his strength. But he deceived her three times by false
statements. He first of all said to her ([Jdg
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#007).md), "If they bound me with strings
that have not been dried, I should be weak and like one of the men"
(i.e., like any other man). יתר signifies a sinew or string, e.g., a
bow-string, [Psa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002.md), and in the
different dialects either a bow-string or the string of a harp or
guitar. As a distinction is made here between the יתרים and the עבתים in
[Jdg 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#011.md), the strings intended here
are those of catgut or animal sinew. The number seven is that of a
divine act, answering to the divine power which Samson possessed.

[Jdg 16:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#008.md)

When Delilah told this to the princes of the Philistines, they brought
the seven strings required, and Delilah bound Samson with them. "And the
spy sat in the room (להּ, dat. com., lit. 'to her,' i.e.) to help her."
namely, without Samson knowing it, as Delilah had certainly not told him
that she should betray the secret of his strength to the Philistines. He
was there, no doubt, that he might be at hand and overpower the fettered
giant as soon as it became apparent that his strength was gone. She then
cried out to him, "Philistines upon thee, Samson!" And he snapped the
strings as one would snap a cord in two "when it smells fire," i.e., is
held to the fire.

[Jdg 16:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#010.md)

The second deception: Samson had himself bound with new cords, which had
not yet been used for any purpose, and these also he burst from his arms
like a thread.

[Jdg 16:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#013.md)

The third deception: "If thou weavest together the seven locks of my
hair with the warp. And she drove it in with the plug." These words are
difficult to explain, partly because several technical terms are used
which have more than one meaning, and partly because the account itself
is contracted, both Samson's advice and her fulfilment of it being only
given in a partial form, so that the one has to be completed from the
other. In [Jdg 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#019.md), the only other
passage in which מחלפות occurs, it no doubt means the plaits into which
Samson's long flowing hair was plaited. המּסּכת only occurs here ([Jdg
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#013.md) and [Jdg
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#014).md), and probably means the woven
cloth, or rather what was still upon the loom, the warp of the cloth,
δίασμα (lxx). Accordingly the meaning of the verse would be this: If
thou weavest the seven plaits of my hair along with the warp upon the
loom. The commentators are all agreed that, according to these words,
there must be something wanting in the account, though they are not of
one opinion as to whether the binding of Samson is fully given here, and
all that has to be supplied is the clause "Then shall I be weal," etc.
(as in [Jdg 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#007.md) and [Jdg
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#011).md), or whether the words בּיּתד
ותּתקע add another fact which was necessary to the completeness of the
binding, and if so, how these words are to be understood. In Bertheau's
opinion, the words "and she thrust with the plug" probably mean nothing
more than that she made a noise to wake the sleeping Samson, because it
is neither stated here that she forced the plug into the wall or into
the earth to fasten the plaits with (lxx, Jerome), nor that her
thrusting with the plug contributed in any way to the further fastening
of the hair. These arguments are sound no doubt, but they do not prove
what is intended. When it is stated in [Jdg
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#014.md), that "he tore out the weaver's
plug and the cloth," it is certainly evident that the plug served to
fasten the hair to the cloth or to the loom. Moreover, not only would
any knocking with the plug to waken Samson with the noise have been
altogether superfluous, as the loud cry, "Philistines upon thee,
Samson," would be amply sufficient for this; but it is extremely
improbable that a fact with so little bearing upon the main facts would
be introduced here at all. We come therefore to the same conclusion as
the majority of commentators, viz., that the words in question are to be
understood as referring to something that was done to fasten Samson
still more securely. היּתד = הארג היתד ([Jdg
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#014).md) does not mean the roller or
weaver's beam, to which the threads of the warp were fastened, and round
which the cloth was rolled when finished, as Bertheau supposes, for this
is called ארגים מנור in [Sa1 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#007.md); nor
the σπάθη of the Greeks, a flat piece of wood like a knife, which was
used in the upright loom for the same purpose as our comb or press,
viz., to press the weft together, and so increase the substance of the
cloth (Braun, de vestitu Sacerd. p. 253); but the comb or press itself
which was fastened to the loom, so that it could only be torn out by
force. To complete the account, therefore, we must supply between [Jdg
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#013.md) and [Jdg
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#014.md), "And if thou fastenest it (the
woven cloth) with the plug (the weaver's comb), I shall be weak like one
of the other men; and she wove the seven plaits of his hair into the
warp of the loom." Then follows in [Jdg
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#014.md), "and fastened the cloth with
the weaver's comb." There is no need, however, to assume that what has
to be supplied fell out in copying. We have simply an ellipsis, such as
we often meet with. When Samson as wakened out of his sleep by the cry
of "Philistines upon thee," he tore out the weaver's comb and the warp
(sc.,) from the loom, with his plaits of hair that had been woven in.
The reference to his sleeping warrants the assumption that Delilah had
also performed the other acts of binding while he was asleep. We must
not understand the account, however, as implying that the three acts of
binding followed close upon one another on the very same day. Several
days may very probably have elapsed between them. In this third
deception Samson had already gone so far in his presumptuous trifling
with the divine gift entrusted to him, as to suffer the hair of his head
to be meddled with, though it was sanctified to the Lord. "It would seem
as though this act of sin ought to have brought him to reflection. But
as that was not the case, there remained but one short step more to
bring him to thorough treachery towards the Lord" (O. v. Gerlach).

[Jdg 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#015.md)

This last step was very speedily to follow - [Jdg
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#015.md) After this triple deception,
Delilah said to him, "How canst thou say, I love thee, as thine heart is
not with me" (ie, not devoted to me)?

[Jdg 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#016.md)

With such words as these she plagued him every day, so that his soul
became impatient even to death (see Judg 10;16). The ἁπ. λεγ. אלץ
signifies in Aramaean, to press or plague. The form is Piel, though
without the reduplication of the ל and Chateph-patach under (see Ewald,
90, b.).

[Jdg 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017.md)

"And he showed her all his heart," i.e., he opened his mind thoroughly
to her, and told her that no razor had come upon his head, because he
was a Nazarite from his mother's womb (cf. [Jdg
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005.md), [Jdg
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#007).md). "If I should be shave, my
strength would depart from me, and I should be weak like all other men."

[Jdg 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#018.md)

When Delilah saw (i.e., perceived, namely from his words and his whole
behaviour while making this communication) that he had betrayed the
secret of his strength, she had the princes of the Philistines called:
"Come up this time, ... for he had revealed to her all his heart." This
last clause is not to be understood as having been spoken by Delilah to
the princes themselves, as it is by the Masorites and most of the
commentators, in which case להּ would have to be altered into לי; but it
contains a remark of the writer, introduced as an explanation of the
circumstance that Delilah sent for the princes of the Philistines now
that she was sure of her purpose. This view is confirmed by the word
ועלוּ (came up) which follows, since the use of the perfect instead of
the imperfect with vav consec. can only be explained on the supposition
that the previous clause is a parenthetical one, which interrupts the
course of the narrative, and to which the account of the further
progress of the affair could not be attached by the historical tense
(ויּעלוּ).

(Note: The Keri reading לי arose simply from a misunderstanding,
although it is found in many MSS and early editions, and is without any
critical worth. The Masorites overlooked the fact that the main point is
all that is related of the message of Delilah to the princes of the
Philistines, namely that they were to come this time, and that the rest
can easily be supplied from the context. Studer admits how little ועלוּ
suits that view of the clause which the Keri reading לי requires, and
calls it "syntactically impossible." He proposes, however, to read
ויּעלוּ, without reflecting that this reading is also nothing more than
a change which is rendered necessary by the alteration of להּ into לי,
and has no critical value.)

The princes of the Philistines came up to Delilah on the receipt of this
communication, bringing the money, the promised reward of her treachery
([Jdg 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#005).md), in their hands.

[Jdg 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#019.md)

"Then she made him sleep upon her knees, and called to the man,"
possibly the man lying in wait ([Jdg
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#009.md) and [Jdg
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#012).md), that she might not be alone
with Samson when cutting off his hair; and she cut off the seven plaits
of his hair, and began to afflict him, as his strength departed from him
now.

[Jdg 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#020.md)

She then cried out, "Philistines upon thee, Samson!" And he awaked out
of his sleep, and thought ("said," i.e., to himself), "I will go away as
time upon time (this as at other times), and shake myself loose," sc.,
from the fetters or from the hands of the Philistines; "but he knew not
that Jehovah had departed from him." These last words are very important
to observe in order to form a correct idea of the affair. Samson had
said to Delilah, "If my hair were cut off, my strength would depart from
me" ([Jdg 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017).md). The historian
observes, on the other hand, that "Jehovah had departed from him." The
superhuman strength of Samson did not reside in his hair as hair, but in
the fact that Jehovah was with or near him. But Jehovah was with him so
long as he maintained his condition as a Nazarite. As soon as he broke
away from this by sacrificing the hair which he wore in honour of the
Lord, Jehovah departed from him, and with Jehovah went his strength.

(Note: "Samson was strong because he was dedicated to God, as long as he
preserved the signs of his dedication. But as soon as he lost those
signs, he fell into the utmost weakness in consequence. The whole of
Samson's misfortune came upon him, therefore, because he attributed to
himself some portion of what God did through him. God permitted him to
lose his strength, that he might learn by experience how utterly
powerless he was without the help of God. We have no better teachers
than our own infirmities."-Berleb. Bible.)

[Jdg 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021.md)

The Philistines then seized him, put out his eyes, and led him to Gaza
fettered with double brass chains. The chains are probably called
nechushtaim (double brass) because both hands of both feet were fettered
with them. King Zedekiah, when taken prisoner by the Chaldeans, was
treated in the same manner ([Kg2
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#007).md). There Samson was obliged to
turn the mill in the prison, and grind corn (the participle טחן
expresses the continuance of the action). Grinding a handmill was the
hardest and lowest kind of slave labour (compare [Exo
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005.md) with [Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029).md); and both Greeks and Romans
sentenced their slaves to this as a punishment (see Od. xx. 105ff., vii.
103-4; Terent. Phorm. ii. 1, 19, Andr. i, 2. 29), and it is still
performed by female slaves in the East (see Chardin in Harmar's Beob. b.
d. Orient. iii. 64).

[Judges 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 16:22</span></span>

Samson's Misery, and His Triumph in Death. - [Jdg
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#022.md). The hair of his head began to
grow, as he was shaven. In the word כּאשׁר, as (from the time when he
was shaven), there is an indication that Samson only remained in his
ignominious captivity till his hair began to grow again, i.e., visibly
to grow. What follows agrees with this.

[Jdg 16:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#023.md)

The captivity of this dreaded hero was regarded by the Philistines as a
great victory, which their princes resolved to celebrate with a great
and joyous sacrificial festival in honour of their god Dagon, to whom
they ascribed this victory. "A great sacrifice," consisting in the
offering up of a large number of slain sacrifices. "And for joy," viz.,
to give expression to their joy, i.e., for a joyous festival. Dagon, one
of the principal deities of the Philistines, was worshipped at Gaza and
Ashdod ([Sa2 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002)., and 1 Macc. 10:83.md),
and, according to Jerome on [Isa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md),
in the rest of the Philistine towns as well. It was a fish-deity (דּגון,
from דּג, a fish), and in shape resembled the body of a fish with the
head and hands of a man ([Sa1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#004).md). It
was a male deity, the corresponding female deity being Atargatis (2
Macc. 12:26) or Derceto, and was a symbol of water, and of all the
vivifying forces of nature which produce their effects through the
medium of water, like the Babylonian Ὠοδάκων, one of the four Oannes,
and the Indian Vishnu (see Movers, Phniz. i. pp. 143ff., 590ff., and J.
G. Mller in Herzog's Cycl.).

[Jdg 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#024.md)

All the people took part in this festival, and sang songs of praise to
the god who had given the enemy, who had laid waste their fields and
slain many of their countrymen, into their hands.

[Jdg 16:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#025.md)

When their hearts were merry (יטוב, inf. of יטב), they had Samson
fetched out of the prison, that he might make sport before them, and
"put him between the pillars" of the house or temple in which the
triumphal feast was held. Then he said to the attendant who held his
hand, "Let me loose, and let me touch the pillars upon which the house
is built, that I may lean upon it." הימישׁני is the imperative Hiphil of
the radical verb ימשׁ, which only occurs here; and the Keri substitutes
the ordinary form המישׁ from מוּשׁ. "But the house," adds the historian
by way of preparation for what follows, "was filled with men and women:
all the princes of the Philistines also were there; and upon the roof
were about three thousand men and women, who feasted their eyes with
Samson's sports" (ראה with בּ, used to denote the gratification of
looking).

[Jdg 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#028.md)

Then Samson prayed to Jehovah, "Lord Jehovah, remember me, and only this
time make me strong. O God, that I may avenge myself (with) the revenge
of one of my two eyes upon the Philistines," i.e., may take vengeance
upon them for the loss of only one of my two eyes (משּׁתי, without
Dagesh lene in the ת: see Ewald, 267, b.), - a sentence which shows how
painfully he felt the loss of his two eyes, "a loss the severity of
which even the terrible vengeance which he was meditating could never
outweigh" (Bertheau).

[Jdg 16:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#029.md)

After he had prayed to the Lord for strength for this last great deed,
he embraced the two middle pillars upon which the building was erected,
leant upon them, one with his right hand, the other with the left (viz.,
embracing them with his hands, as these words also belong to ילפּת), and
said, "let my soul die with the Philistines." He then bent (the two
pillars) with force, and the house fell upon the princes and all the
people who were within. So far as the fact itself is concerned, there is
no ground nor questioning the possibility of Samson's bringing down the
whole building with so many men inside by pulling down two middle
columns, as we have no accurate acquaintance with the style of its
architecture. In all probability we have to picture this temple of Dagon
as resembling the modern Turkish kiosks, namely as consisting of a
"spacious hall, the roof of which rested in front upon four columns, two
of them standing at the ends, and two close together in the centre.
Under this hall the leading men of the Philistines celebrated a
sacrificial meal, whilst the people were assembled above upon the top of
the roof, which was surrounded by a balustrade" (Faber, Archol. der.
Hebr. p. 444, cf. pp. 436-7; and Shaw, Reisen, p. 190). The ancients
enter very fully into the discussion of the question whether Samson
committed suicide or not, though without arriving at any satisfactory
conclusion. O. v. Gerlach, however, has given the true answer. "Samson's
deed," he says, "was not suicide, but the act of a hero, who sees that
it is necessary for him to plunge into the midst of his enemies with the
inevitable certainty of death, in order to effect the deliverance of his
people and decide the victory which he has still to achieve. Samson
would be all the more certain that this was the will of the Lord, when
he considered that even if he should deliver himself in any other way
cut of the hands of the Philistines, he would always carry about with
him the mark of his shame in the blindness of his eyes-a mark of his
unfaithfulness as the servant of God quite as much as of the double
triumph of his foes, who had gained a spiritual as well as a corporeal
victory over him." Such a triumph as this the God of Israel could not
permit His enemies and their idols to gain. The Lord must prove to them,
even through Samson's death, that the shame of his sin was taken from
him, and that the Philistines had no cause to triumph over him. Thus
Samson gained the greatest victory over his foes in the moment of his
own death. The terror of the Philistines when living, he became a
destroyer of the temple of their idol when he died. Through this last
act of his he vindicated the honour of Jehovah the God of Israel,
against Dagon the idol of the Philistines. "The dead which he slew at
his death were more than they which he slew in his life."

[Jdg 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#031.md)

This terrible blow necessarily made a powerful impression upon the
Philistines, not only plunging them into deep mourning at the death of
their princes and so many of their countrymen, and the destruction of
the temple of Dagon, but filling them with fear and terror at the
omnipotence of the God of the Israelites. Under these circumstances it
is conceivable enough that the brethren and relatives of Samson were
able to come to Gaza, and fetch away the body of the fallen hero, to
bury it in his father's grave between Zorea and Eshtaol (see [Jdg
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025).md). - In conclusion, it is once
more very appropriately observed that Samson had judged Israel twenty
years (cf. [Jdg 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#020).md).
