### [Isaiah Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 52:1</span></span>

The same call, which was addressed in [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md) to the arm of Jehovah that was
then represented as sleeping, is here addressed to Jerusalem, which is
represented as a sleeping woman. "Awake, awake; clothe thyself in thy
might, O Zion; clothe thyself in thy state dresses, O Jerusalem, thou
holy city: for henceforth there will no more enter into thee one
uncircumcised and unclean! Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down,
O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the chains of thy neck, O captive
daughter of Zion!" Jerusalem is lying upon the ground stupefied with the
wrath of God, and exhausted with grief; but this shameful prostration
and degradation will now come to an end. She is to rise up and put on
her might, which has long been broken down, and apparently has
altogether disappeared, but which can and must be constantly renewed,
because it rests upon the foundation of an inviolable promise. She is to
wake up and recover her ancient power, and put on her state robes, i.e.,
her priestly and royal ornaments, which belong to her as a "royal city,"
i.e., as the city of Jehovah had His anointed one. For henceforth she
will be what she was always intended to be, and that without any further
desecration. Heathen, uncircumcised, and those who were unclean in heart
and flesh ([Eze 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#009).md), had entered her
by force, and desecrated her: heathen, who had no right to enter the
congregation of Jehovah as they were ([Lam
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#010).md). But she should no longer be
defiled, not to say conquered, by such invaders as these ([Joe
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017.md); [Nah
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001.md); compare [Joe
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#007.md) with [Nah
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001).md). On the construction non perget
intrabit = intrare, see Ges. 142, 3, c. In [Isa
52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002.md) the idea of the city falls into
the background, and that of the nation takes its place. ירולשׁם שׁבי
does not mean "captive people of Jerusalem," however, as Hitzig
supposes, for this would require שׁביה in accordance with the
personification, as in [Isa 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002.md). The
rendering supported by the lxx is the true one, "Sit down, O Jerusalem;"
and this is also the way in which it is accentuated. The exhortation is
the counterpart of [Isa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md).
Jerusalem is sitting upon the ground as a prisoner, having no seat to
sit upon; but this is only that she may be the more highly exalted; -
whereas the daughter of Babylon is seated as a queen upon a throne, but
only to be the more deeply degraded. The former is now to shake herself
free from the dust, and to rise up and sit down (viz., upon a throne,
Targum). The captive daughter of Zion (shebhiyyâh, αἰχμάλωτος, [Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md), an adjective written first for
the sake of emphasis, as in [Isa
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#030.md); [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011).md) is to undo for herself (sibi
laxare according to p. 62, note, like hithnachēl, [Isa
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002), sibi possidendo capere.md) the
chains of her neck (the chethib התפתחו, they loosen themselves, is
opposed to the beautiful parallelism); for she who was mourning in her
humiliation is to be restored to honour once more, and she who was so
shamefully laden with fetters to liberty.

[Isaiah 52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 52:3</span></span>

The reason for the address is now given in a well-sustained promise.
"For thus saith Jehovah, Ye have been sold for nothing, and ye shall not
be redeemed with silver. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, My people went
down to Egypt in the beginning to dwell there as guests; and Asshur has
oppressed it for nothing. And now, what have I to do here? saith
Jehovah: for my people are taken away for nothing; their oppressors
shriek, saith Jehovah, and my name is continually blasphemed all the
day. Therefore my people shall learn my name; therefore, in that day,
that I am He who saith, There am I." Ye have been sold (this is the
meaning of [Isa 52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003).md); but this
selling is merely a giving over to a foreign power, without the
slightest advantage accusing to Him who had no other object in view than
to cause them to atone for their sins ([Isa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001).md), and without any other people
taking their place, and serving Him in their stead as an equivalent for
the loss He sustained. And there would be no need of silver to purchase
the favour of Him who had given them up, since a manifestation of divine
power would be all that would be required ([Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013).md). For whether Jehovah show
Himself to Israel as the Righteous One or as the Gracious One, as a
Judge or as a Redeemer, He always acts as the Absolute One, exalted
above all earthly affairs, having no need to receive anything, but able
to give everything. He receives no recompense, and gives none. Whether
punishing or redeeming, He always guards His people's honour, proving
Himself in the one case to be all-sufficient, and in the other almighty,
but acting in both cases freely from Himself.

In the train of thought in [Isa 52:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#004.md)
the reason is given for the general statement in [Isa
52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003.md). Israel went down to Egypt, the
country of the Nile valley, with the innocent intention of sojourning,
i.e., living as a guest (gūr) there in a foreign land; and yet (as we
may supply from the next clause, according to the law of a
self-completing parallelism) there it fell into the bondage of the
Pharaohs, who, whilst they did not fear Jehovah, but rather despised
Him, were merely the blind instruments of His will. Asshur then
oppressed it bephes, i.e., not "at last" (ultimo tempore, as Hvernick
renders it), but (as אפס is the synonym of אין in [Isa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017.md); [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002).md) "for nothing," i.e., without
having acquired any right to it, but rather serving in its
unrighteousness simply as the blind instrument of the righteousness of
Jehovah, who through the instrumentality of Asshur put an end first of
all to the kingdom of Israel, and then to the kingdom of Judah. The two
references to the Egyptian and Assyrian oppressions are expressed in as
brief terms as possible. But with the words "now therefore" the prophecy
passes on in a much more copious strain to the present oppression in
Babylon. Jehovah inquires, Quid mihi hic (What have I to do here)?
Hitzig supposes pōh (here) to refer to heaven, in the sense of, "What
pressing occupation have I here, that all this can take place without my
interfering?" But such a question as this would be far more appropriate
to the Zeus of the Greek comedy than to the Jehovah of prophecy. Knobel,
who takes pōh as referring to the captivity, in accordance with the
context, gives a ridiculous turn to the question, viz., "What do I get
here in Babylonia, from the fact that my people are carried off for
nothing? Only loss." He observes himself that there is a certain wit in
the question. But it would be silly rather than witty, if, after Jehovah
had just stated that He had given up His people for nothing, the prophet
represented Him as preparing to redeem it by asking, "What have I gained
by it?" The question can have no other meaning, according to [Isa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#016.md), than "What have I to do here?"
Jehovah is thought of as present with His people (cf., [Gen
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#004).md), and means to inquire whether He
shall continue this penal condition of exile any longer (Targum, Rashi,
Rosenmller, Ewald, Stier, etc.). The question implies an intention to
redeem Israel, and the reason for this intention is introduced with kı̄.
Israel is taken away (ablatus), viz., from its own native home, chinnâm,
i.e., without the Chaldeans having any human claim upon them whatever.
The words יהיליילוּ משׁליו (משׁלו) are not to be rendered, "its singers
lament," as Reutschi and Rosenmller maintain, since the singers of
Israel are called meshōrerı̄m; nor "its (Israel's) princes lament," as
Vitringa and Hitzig supposed, since the people of the captivity,
although they had still their national sârı̄m, had no other mōshelı̄m than
the Chaldean oppressors ([Isa 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md);
[Isa 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005).md). It is the intolerable
tyranny of the oppressors of His people, that Jehovah assigns in this
sentence as the reason for His interposition, which cannot any longer be
deferred. It is true that we do meet with hēlı̄l (of which we have the
future here without any syncope of the first syllable) in other passages
in the sense of ululare, as a cry of pain; but just as הריע, רנן, רזח
signify a yelling utterance of either joy or pain, so heeliil may also
be applied to the harsh shrieking of the capricious tyrants, like
Lucan's laetis ululare triumphis, and the Syriac ailel, which is used to
denote a war-cry and other noises as well. In connection with this proud
and haughty bluster, there is also the practice of making Jehovah's name
the butt of their incessant blasphemy: מנּאץ is a part. hithpoel with an
assimilated ת and a pausal ā for ē, although it might also be a passive
hithpoal (for the ō in the middle syllable, compare מגאל, [Mal
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007.md); מבהל, [Est
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#014).md). In [Isa
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#006.md) there follows the closing
sentence of the whole train of thought: therefore His people are to get
to learn His name, i.e., the self-manifestation of its God, who is so
despised by the heathen; therefore lâkhēn repeated with emphasis, like
כּעל in [Isa 59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md), and possibly min
in [Psa 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009).md) in that day, the day of
redemption, (supply "it shall get to learn") that "I am he who saith,
Here am I," i.e., that He who has promised redemption is now present as
the True and Omnipotent One to carry it into effect.

[Isaiah 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 52:7</span></span>

The first two turns in the prophecy ([Isa
52:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md), [Isa
52:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003).md) close here. The third turn
([Isa 52:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007).md) exults at the salvation
which is being carried into effect. The prophet sees in spirit, how the
tidings of the redemption, to which the fall of Babylon, which is
equivalent to the dismission of the prisoners, gives the finishing
stroke, are carried over the mountains of Judah to Jerusalem. "How
lovely upon the mountains are the feet of them that bring good tidings,
that publish peace, that bring tidings of good, that publish salvation,
that say unto Zion, Thy God reigneth royally!" The words are addressed
to Jerusalem, consequently the mountains are those of the Holy Land, and
especially those to the north of Jerusalem: mebhassēr is collective (as
in the primary passage, [Nah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001.md); cf.,
[Isa 41:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#027.md); [Psa
68:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#012).md), "whoever brings the glad
tidings to Jerusalem." The exclamation "how lovely" does not refer to
the lovely sound of their footsteps, but to the lovely appearance
presented by their feet, which spring over the mountains with all the
swiftness of gazelles ([Sol 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md); [Sol
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014).md). Their feet look as if they had
wings, because they are the messengers of good tidings of joy. The
joyful tidings that are left indefinite in mebhassēr, are afterwards
more particularly described as a proclamation of peace, good, salvation,
and also as containing the announcement "thy God reigneth," i.e., has
risen to a right royal sway, or seized upon the government (מלך in an
inchoative historical sense, as in the theocratic psalms which commence
with the same watchword, or like ἐβασίλευσε in [Rev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006.md), cf., [Rev
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017).md). Up to this time, when His
people were in bondage, He appeared to have lost His dominion ([Isa
63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019).md); but now He has ascended the
throne as a Redeemer with greater glory than ever before ([Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023).md). The gospel of the swift-footed
messengers, therefore, is the gospel of the kingdom of God that is at
hand; and the application which the apostle makes of this passage of
Isaiah in [Rom 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015.md), is justified by
the fact that the prophet saw the final and universal redemption as
though in combination with the close of the captivity.

[Isaiah 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 52:8</span></span>

How will the prophets rejoice, when they see bodily before them what
they have already seen from afar! "Hark, thy watchers! They lift up the
voice together; they rejoice: for they see eye to eye, how Jehovah
bringeth Zion home." קול followed by a genitive formed an interjectional
clause, and had almost become an interjection itself (see [Gen
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010).md). The prophets are here called
tsōphı̄m, spies, as persons who looked into the distance as if from a
watch-tower (specula, [Isa 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006.md); [Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001).md) just as in [Isa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010.md). It is assumed that the people
of the captivity would still have prophets among them: in fact, the very
first word in these prophecies ([Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001).md) is addressed to them. They who
saw the redemption from afar, and comforted the church therewith
(different from mebhassēr, the evangelist of the fulfilment), lift up
their voice together with rejoicing; for they see Jehovah bringing back
Zion, as closely as one man is to another when he looks directly into
his eyes ([Num 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014).md). בּ is the same
as in the construction בּ ראה; and שׁוּב has the transitive meaning
reducere, restituere (as in [Psa 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md);
[Psa 126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001), etc..md), which is placed
beyond all doubt by שׁוּבנוּ in [Psa
85:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#005.md).

[Isaiah 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 52:9</span></span>

Zion is restored, inasmuch as Jehovah turns away her misery, brings back
her exiles, and causes the holy city to rise again from her ruins.
"Break out into exultation, sing together, ye ruins of Jerusalem: for
Jehovah hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem." Because
the word of consolation has become an act of consolation, i.e., of
redemption, the ruins of Jerusalem are to break out into jubilant
shouting as they rise again from the ground.

[Isaiah 52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 52:10</span></span>

Jehovah has wrought out salvation through judgment in the sight of all
the world. "Jehovah hath made bare His holy arm before the eyes of all
nations, and all the ends of the earth see the salvation of our God." As
a warrior is accustomed to make bare his right arm up to the shoulder,
that he may fight without encumbrance (exsertare humeros nudamque
lacessere pugnan, as Statius says in Theb. i. 413), so has Jehovah made
bare His holy arm, that arm in which holiness dwells, which shines with
holiness, and which acts in holiness, that arm which has been hitherto
concealed and therefore has appeared to be powerless, and that in the
sight of the whole world of nations; so that all the ends of the earth
come to see the reality of the work, which this arm has already
accomplished by showing itself in its unveiled glory - in other words,
"the salvation of our God."

[Isaiah 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 52:11</span></span>

This salvation in its immediate manifestation is the liberation of the
exiles; and on the ground of what the prophet sees in spirit, he
exclaims to them (as in [Isa 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020).md),
in [Isa 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md), [Isa
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012.md) : "Go ye forth, go ye forth, go
out from thence, lay hold of no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of
her, cleanse yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of Jehovah. For ye
shall not go out in confusion, and ye shall not go forth in flight: for
Jehovah goeth before you, and the God of Israel is your rear-guard."
When they go out from thence, i.e., from Babylon, they are not to touch
anything unclean, i.e., they are not to enrich themselves with the
property of their now subjugated oppressors, as was the case at the
exodus from Egypt ([Exo 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#036).md). It is
to be a holy procession, at which they are to appear morally as well as
corporeally unstained. But those who bear the vessels of Jehovah, i.e.,
the vessels of the temple, are not only not to defile themselves, but
are to purify themselves (hibbârū with the tone upon the last syllable,
a regular imperative niphal of bârar). This is an indirect prophecy, and
was fulfilled in the fact that Cyrus directed the golden and silver
vessels, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought to Babylon, to be restored to
the returning exiles as their rightful property ([Ezr
1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007).md). It would thus be possible for
them to put themselves into the right attitude for their departure,
since it would not take place in precipitous haste (bechippâzon), as the
departure from Egypt did ([Deu 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#003.md),
cf., [Exo 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#039).md), nor like a flight,
but they would go forth under the guidance of Jehovah. מאסּפכם (with the
ē changed into the original ı̆) does not man, "He bringeth you, the
scattered ones, together," but according to [Num
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#025.md); [Jos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#009.md), [Jos
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#013.md), "He closes your procession," -
He not only goes before you to lead you, but also behind you, to protect
you (as in [Exo 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019).md). For the
me'assēph, or the rear-guard of an army, is its keystone, and has to
preserve the compactness of the whole.

The division of the chapters generally coincides with the several
prophetic addresses. But here it needs emendation. Most of the
commentators are agreed that the words "Behold my servant," etc. (hinnēh
yaskı̄l ‛abhdı̄) commence a new section, like hēn ‛abhdı̄ (behold my
servant) in [Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md).

[Isaiah 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 52:13</span></span>

In this sense there follows here, immediately after the cry. "Go ye out
from Babylon," an index pointing from the suffering of the Servant to
His reward in glory. "Behold, my servant will act wisely; he will come
forth, and arise, and be very high." Even apart from [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001), hinnēh (hēn.md) is a favourite
commencement with Isaiah; and this very first v. contains, according to
Isaiah's custom, a brief, condensed explanation of the theme. The
exaltation of the Servant of Jehovah is the theme of the prophecy which
follows. In v. 13a the way is shown, by which He reaches His greatness;
in v. 13b the increasing greatness itself. השׂכּיל by itself means
simply to gain, prove, or act with intelligence (lxx συνήσει); and then,
since intelligent action, as a rule, is also effective, it is used as
synonymous with הצליח, הכשׁהיר, to act with result, i.e., so as to be
successful. Hence it is only by way of sequence that the idea of
"prosperously" is connected with that of "prudently" (e.g., [Jos
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#008.md); [Jer
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021).md). The word is never applied to
such prosperity as a man enjoys without any effort of his own, but only
to such as he attains by successful action, i.e., by such action as is
appropriate to the desired and desirable result. In [Jer
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#002.md), where hiskı̄l is one feature in
the picture of the dominion exercised by the Messiah, the idea of
intelligent action is quite sufficient, without any further subordinate
meaning. But here, where the exaltation is derived from ישׂכיל as the
immediate consequence, without any intervening על־כן, there is naturally
associated with the idea of wise action, i.e., of action suited to the
great object of his call, that of effective execution or abundant
success, which has as its natural sequel an ever-increasing exaltation.
Rosenmller observes, in [Isa 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md),
"There is no need to discuss, or even to inquire, what precise
difference there is in the meaning of the separate words;" but this is a
very superficial remark. If we consider that rūm signifies not only to
be high, but to rise up ([Pro 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#011).md)
and become exalted, and also to become manifest as exalted (Ps. 21:14),
and that נשּׂא, according to the immediate and original reflective
meaning of the niphal, signifies to raise one's self, whereas gâbhah
expresses merely the condition, without the subordinate idea of
activity, we obtain this chain of thought: he will rise up, he will
raise himself still higher, he will stand on high. The three verbs (of
which the two perfects are defined by the previous future) consequently
denote the commencement, the continuation, and the result or climax of
the exaltation; and Stier is not wrong in recalling to mind the three
principal steps of the exaltatio in the historical fulfilment, viz., the
resurrection, the ascension, and the sitting down at the right hand of
God. The addition of the word מאד shows very clearly that וגבהּ is
intended to be taken as the final result: the servant of Jehovah, rising
from stage to stage, reaches at last an immeasurable height, that towers
above everything besides (comp. ὑπερύψωσε in [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md), with ὑψωθείς in [Act
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033.md), and for the nature of the
ὑπερύψωσε, [Eph 1:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 52:14</span></span>

The prophecy concerning him passes now into an address to him, as in
[Isa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md) (cf., [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007).md), which sinks again immediately
into an objective tone. "Just as many were astonished at thee: so
disfigured, his appearance was not human, and his form not like that of
the children of men: so will he make many nations to tremble; kings will
shut their mouth at him: for they see what has not been told them, and
discover what they have not heard." Both Oehler and Hahn suppose that
the first clause is addressed to Israel, and that it is here pointed
away from its own degradation, which excited such astonishment, to the
depth of suffering endured by the One man. Hahn's principal reason,
which Oehler adopts, is the sudden leap that we should otherwise have to
assume from the second person to the third - an example of "negligence"
which we can hardly impute to the prophet. But a single glance at [Isa
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#020.md) and [Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md) is sufficient to show how little
force there is in this principal argument. We should no doubt expect
עליכם or עליך after what has gone before, if the nation were addressed;
but it is difficult to see what end a comparison between the sufferings
of the nation and those of the One man, which merely places the
sufferings of the two in an external relation to one another, could be
intended to answer; whilst the second kēn (so), which evidently
introduces an antithesis, is altogether unexplained. The words are
certainly addressed to the servant of Jehovah; and the meaning of the
sicut (just as) in [Isa 52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014.md), and of
the sic (so) which introduces the principal sentence in [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md), is, that just as His
degradation was the deepest degradation possible, so His glorification
would be of the loftiest kind. The height of the exaltation is held up
as presenting a perfect contrast to the depth of the degradation. The
words, "so distorted was his face, more than that of a man," form, as
has been almost unanimously admitted since the time of Vitringa, a
parenthesis, containing the reason for the astonishment excited by the
servant of Jehovah. Stier is wrong in supposing that this first "so"
(kēn) refers to ka'ăsher (just as), in the sense of "If men were
astonished at thee, there was ground for the astonishment." [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md) would not stand out as an
antithesis, if we adopted this explanation; moreover, the thought that
the fact corresponded to the impression which men received, is a very
tame and unnecessary one; and the change of persons in sentences related
to one another in this manner is intolerably harsh; whereas, with our
view of the relation in which the sentences stand to one another, the
parenthesis prepares the way for the sudden change from a direct address
to a declaration. Hitherto many had been astonished at the servant of
Jehovah: shâmēm, to be desolate or waste, to be thrown by anything into
a desolate or benumbed condition, to be startled, confused, as it were
petrified, by paralyzing astonishment ([Lev
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#032.md); [Eze
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#016)). To such a degree (kēn, adeo.md)
was his appearance mishchath mē'ı̄sh, and his form mibbenē 'âdâm (sc.,
mishchath). We might take mishchath as the construct of mishchâth, as
Hitzig does, since this connecting form is sometimes used (e.g., [Isa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006).md) even without any genitive
relation; but it may also be the absolute, syncopated from משׁחתתּ =
משׁחתת (Hvernick and Stier), like moshchath in [Mal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014.md), or, what we prefer, after the
form mirmas ([Isa 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006).md), with the
original ă, without the usual lengthening (Ewald, 160, c, Anm. 4). His
appearance and his form were altogether distortion (stronger than
moshchâth, distorted), away from men, out beyond men, i.e., a distortion
that destroys all likeness to a man;

(Note: The church before the time of Constantine pictured to itself the
Lord, as He walked on earth, as repulsive in His appearance; whereas the
church after Constantine pictured Him as having quite an ideal beauty
(see my tract, Jesus and Hillel, 1865, p. 4). They were both right:
unattractive in appearance, though not deformed, He no doubt was in the
days of His flesh; but He is ideally beautiful in His glorification. The
body in which He was born of Mary was no royal form, though faith could
see the doxa shining through. It was no royal form, for the suffering of
death was the portion of the Lamb of God, even from His mother's womb;
but the glorified One is infinitely exalted above all the idea of art.)

'ı̄sh does not signify man as distinguished from woman here, but a human
being generally.

The antithesis follows in [Isa 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md) :
viz., the state of glory in which this form of wretchedness has passed
away. As a parallel to the "many" in [Isa
52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014.md), we have here "many nations,"
indicating the excess of the glory by the greater fulness of the
expression; and as a parallel to "were astonished at thee," "he shall
make to tremble" (yazzeh), in other words, the effect which He produces
by what He does to the effect produced by what He suffers. The hiphil
hizzâh generally means to spirt or sprinkle (adspergere), and is applied
to the sprinkling of the blood with the finger, more especially upon the
capporeth and altar of incense on the day of atonement (differing in
this respect from zâraq, the swinging of the blood out of a bowl), also
to the sprinkling of the water of purification upon a leper with the
bunch of hyssop ([Lev 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#007).md), and of
the ashes of the red heifer upon those defiled through touching a corpse
([Num 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#018).md); in fact, generally, to
sprinkling for the purpose of expiation and sanctification. And
Vitringa, Hengstenberg, and others, accordingly follow the Syriac and
Vulgate in adopting the rendering adsperget (he will sprinkle). They
have the usage of the language in their favour; and this explanation
also commends itself from a reference to נגוּע in [Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md), and נגע in [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md) (words which are generally used
of leprosy, and on account of which the suffering Messiah is called in
b. Sanhedrin 98b by an emblematical name adopted from the old synagogue,
"the leper of Rabbi's school"), since it yields the significant
antithesis, that he who was himself regarded as unclean, even as a
second Job, would sprinkle and sanctify whole nations, and thus abolish
the wall of partition between Israel and the heathen, and gather
together into one holy church with Israel those who had hitherto been
pronounced "unclean" ([Isa 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001).md). But,
on the other hand, this explanation has so far the usage of the language
against it, that hizzâh is never construed with the accusative of the
person or thing sprinkled (like adspergere aliqua re aliquem; since 'eth
in [Lev 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006.md), [Lev
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#017.md) is a preposition like ‛al, ‛el
elsewhere); moreover, there would be something very abrupt in this
sudden representation of the servant as a priest. Such explanations as
"he will scatter asunder" (disperget, Targum, etc.), or "he will spill"
(sc., their blood), are altogether out of the question; such thoughts as
these would be quite out of place in a spiritual picture of salvation
and glory, painted upon the dark ground we have here. The verb nâzâh
signified primarily to leap or spring; hence hizzâh, with the causative
meaning to sprinkle. The kal combines the intransitive and transitive
meanings of the word "spirt," and is used in the former sense in [Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md), to signify the springing up or
sprouting up of any liquid scattered about in drops. The Arabic nazâ
(see Ges. Thes.) shows that this verb may also be applied to the
springing or leaping of living beings, caused by excess of emotion. And
accordingly we follow the majority of the commentators in adopting the
rendering exsilire faciet. The fact that whole nations are the object,
and not merely individuals, proves nothing to the contrary, as [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md) clearly shows. The reference is to
their leaping up in amazement (lxx θαυμάσονται); and the verb denotes
less an external than an internal movement. They will tremble with
astonishment within themselves (cf., pâchădū verâgezū in [Jer
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009).md), being electrified, as it were,
by the surprising change that has taken place in the servant of Jehovah.
The reason why kings "shut their mouths at him" is expressly stated,
viz., what was never related they see, and what was never heard of they
perceive; i.e., it was something going far beyond all that had ever been
reported to them outside the world of nations, or come to their
knowledge within it. Hitzig's explanation, that they do not trust
themselves to begin to speak before him or along with him, gives too
feeble a sense, and would lead us rather to expect לפניו than עליו. The
shutting of the mouth is the involuntary effect of the overpowering
impression, or the manifestation of their extreme amazement at one so
suddenly brought out of the depths, and lifted up to so great a height.
The strongest emotion is that which remains shut up within ourselves,
because, from its very intensity, it throws the whole nature into a
suffering state, and drowns all reflection in emotion (cf., yachărı̄sh in
[Zep 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017).md). The parallel in [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md) is not opposed to this; the
speechless astonishment, at what is unheard and inconceivable, changes
into adoring homage, as soon as they have become to some extent familiar
with it. The first turn in the prophecy closes here: The servant of
Jehovah, whose inhuman sufferings excite such astonishment, is exalted
on high; so that from utter amazement the nations tremble, and their
kings are struck dumb.
