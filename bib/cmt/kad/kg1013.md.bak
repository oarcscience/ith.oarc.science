### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 13:1</span></span>

A prophet out of Judah announces to Jeroboam the eventual overthrow of
the idolatrous worship, and attests his divine mission by miraculous
signs upon the altar at Bethel and the hardened king ([Kg1
13:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001).md); but on the way back he
allows himself to be enticed by an old prophet out of Bethel to go into
his house, contrary to the express command of the Lord, and while
sitting at table with him has to hear from his mouth the divine threat,
that on account of his transgression of the command of God he will not
come into the sepulchre of his fathers. This threat was fulfilled on his
way home; and the marvellous fulfilment made so deep an impression upon
the old prophet, that he confirmed the testimony which he had given
concerning the worship at the high places (vv. 11-32). These marvellous
occurrences not only teach how Jeroboam brought about the overthrow of
his dynasty by his thorough hardening against the word of God ([Kg1
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#033.md), [Kg1
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#034).md), but they also show how false
prophecy rose up from the very beginning in the kingdom of Israel and
set itself against the true prophets of the Lord, and how it gained a
victory, which merely displayed its own impotence, however, and
foreshadowed its eventual and certain overthrow.

[Kg1 13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md)

Prophecy against the idolatrous worship at Bethel. - [Kg1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md), [Kg1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002.md). Whilst Jeroboam was still
occupied in sacrificing by the altar at Bethel, there came a prophet
(אלהים אישׁ) out of Judah "in the word of Jehovah" to Bethel, and
pronounced upon the altar its eventual destruction. יהוה בּדבר does not
mean "at the word of Jehovah" here, as it frequently does, but "in the
word of Jehovah," as [Kg1 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#009.md), [Kg1
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#017.md) more especially show; so that
the word of Jehovah is regarded as a power which comes upon the prophet
and drives him to utter the divine revelation which he has received. It
is the same in [Kg1 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#035.md). להקטיר is
to be taken as in [Kg1 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#033.md). -
"Behold a son will be born to the house of David, named Josiah; he will
offer upon thee (O altar) the priests of the high places, who burn
incense (i.e., kindle sacrifices) upon thee, and men's bones will they
burn upon thee." According to [Kg2
23:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015.md), this prophecy was literally
fulfilled. The older theologians found in this an evident proof of the
divine inspiration of the prophets; modern theology, on the other hand,
which denies the supernatural inspiration of prophecy in accordance with
its rationalistic or naturalistic principles, supplies that this
prophecy was not more precisely defined till after the event, and
adduces in support of this the apparently just argument, that the
prediction of particular historical events is without analogy, and
generally that the introduction either of particular persons by name or
of definite numbers is opposed to the very essence of prophecy, and
turns prediction into soothsaying. The distinction between soothsaying
and prediction, however, is not that the latter merely utters general
ideas concerning the future, whilst the former announces special
occurrences beforehand: but soothsaying is the foretelling of all kinds
of accidental things; prophecy, on the contrary, the foretelling of the
progressive development of the kingdom of God, not merely in general,
but in its several details, according to the circumstances and
necessities of each particular age, and that in such a manner that the
several concrete details of the prophecy rest upon the general idea of
the revelation of salvation, and are thereby entirely removed from the
sphere of the accidental. It is true that perfectly concrete predictions
of particular events, with the introduction of names and statement of
times, are much more rare than the predictions of the progressive
development of the kingdom of God according to its general features; but
they are not altogether wanting, and we meet with them in every case
where it was of importance to set before an ungodly generation in the
most impressive manner the truth of the divine threatenings of promises.
The allusion to Coresh in [Isa 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md);
[Isa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md), is analogous to the
announcement before us. But in both cases the names are closely
connected with the destination of the persons in the prophecy, and are
simply a concrete description of what God will accomplish through these
men. Hence the name יאשׁיּהוּ occurs primarily according to its
appellative meaning alone, viz., "he whom Jehovah supports," from אשׁה,
to support, and expresses this thought: there will be born a son to the
house of David, whom Jehovah will support of establish, so that he shall
execute judgment upon the priests of the high places at Bethel. This
prophecy was then afterwards so fulfilled by the special arrangement of
God, that the king who executed this judgment bore the name of Joshiyahu
as his proper name. And so also כּורשׁ was originally an appellative in
the sense of sun. The judgment which the prophet pronounced upon the
altar was founded upon the jus talionis. On the very same altar on which
the priests offer sacrifice to the עגלים shall they themselves be
offered, and the altar shall be defiled for ever by the burning of men's
bones upon it. אדם עצמות, "men's bones," does not stand for "their (the
priests') bones," but is simply an epithet used to designate human
corpses, which defile the place where they lie ([Kg2
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016).md).

[Kg1 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#003.md)

In confirmation of his word the prophet added a miracle (מופת, τέρας,
portentum, see at [Exo 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021).md): "this is
the sign that the Lord hath spoken (through me): behold the altar will
be rent in pieces, and the ashes upon it will be poured out." דּשׁן is
the ashes of the fat of the sacrificial animals. The pouring out of the
sacrificial ashes in consequence of the breaking upon of the altar was a
penal sign, which indicated, along with the destruction of the altar,
the desecration of the sacrificial service performed upon it.

[Kg1 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#004.md)

The king, enraged at this announcement, stretched out his hand against
the prophet with the words, "seize him" - and his hand dried up, so that
he was not able to draw it back again. יבשׁ, to dry up, i.e., toe become
rigid in consequence of a miraculous withdrawal of the vital energy.
Thus Jeroboam experienced in the limbs of his own body the severity of
the threatened judgment of God.

[Kg1 13:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#005.md)

The penal miracle announced in the word of Jehovah, i.e., in the
strength of the Lord, also took effect immediately upon the altar; and
the defiant king was now obliged to entreat the man of God, saying,
"Soften, I pray, the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my
hand may return to me," i.e., that I may be able to draw it back again,
to move it once more. And this also took place at once at the
intercession of the prophet. יי את־פּני חלּה, lit., to stroke the face
of God, i.e., to render it soft by intercession (see at [Exo
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011).md).

[Kg1 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#007.md)

As Jeroboam could do nothing by force against the prophet, he
endeavoured to gain him over to his side by friendliness, that at least
he might render his threat harmless in the eyes of the people. For this
purpose, and not to do him honour or to make him some acknowledgment for
the restoration of his hand, he invited him to his house, to strengthen
himself with food (סעד as in [Gen
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005.md); [Jdg
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#005.md); for the form סעדה, see Ewald, 41,
c.) and receive from him a present.

[Kg1 13:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#008.md)

But this design was also frustrated, and the rejection of his worship on
the part of God was still more strongly declared. "If thou gavest me,"
the man of God replied, "the half of thy house, I shall not go in with
thee, nor eat bread and drink water in this place; for thus hath Jehovah
commanded me," etc. The subject, Jehovah, is easily supplied to צוּה
from the context (vid., Ewald, 294, b.). God had forbidden the prophet
to eat and drink "to manifest His detestation of idolatry, and to show
by that fact that the Bethelites were so detestable, and as it were
excommunicated by God, that He wished none of the faithful to join with
them in eating and drinking" (C. a Lap.). He was not to return by the
way by which he came, that no one might look out for him, and force him
to a delay which was irreconcilable with his commission, or "lest by
chance being brought back by Jeroboam, he should do anything to please
him which was unworthy of a prophet, or from which it might be inferred
that idolaters might hope for some favour from the Deity" (Budd.).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 13:11</span></span>

Seduction of the man of God by an old prophet, and his consequent
punishment. - [Kg1 13:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#011.md). The man
of God had resisted the invitations of Jeroboam, and set out by a
different road to return to Judah. An old prophet at Bethel heard from
his sons what had taken place (the singular בנו יבוא as compared with
the plural ויספּרוּם may be explained on the supposition that first of
all one son related the matter to his father, and that then the other
sons supported the account given by the first); had his ass saddled;
hurried after him, and found him sitting under the terebinth (the tree
well known from that event); invited him to come into his house and eat
with him; and when the latter appealed to the divine prohibition, said
to him ([Kg1 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#018).md), "I am a prophet
also as thou art, and an angel has said to me in the word of the Lord:
Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat and drink," and
lied to him (לו כּחשׁ without a copula, because it is inserted as it
were parenthetically, simply as an explanation) - then he went back with
him, and ate and drank in his house.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 13:20</span></span>

As they were sitting at table the word of the Lord came to the old
prophet, so that he cried out to the man of God from Judah: "Because
thou hast been rebellious against the command of the Lord, and hast not
kept the commandment, ... thou wilt not come to the grave of thy
fathers," i.e., thou wilt meet with a violent death by the way. This
utterance was soon fulfilled.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 13:23</span></span>

After he had eaten he saddled the ass for him, i.e., for the prophet
whom he had fetched back, and the latter (the prophet from Judah)
departed upon it. On the road a lion met him and slew him; "and his
corpse was cast in the road, but the ass stood by it, and the lion stood
by the corpse." The lion, contrary to its nature, had neither consumed
the prophet whom it had slain, nor torn in pieces and devoured the ass
upon which he rode, but had remained standing by the corpse and by the
ass, that the slaying of the prophet might not be regarded as a
misfortune that had befallen him by accident, but that the hand of the
Lord might be manifest therein, so that passers-by saw this marvel and
related it in Bethel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 13:26</span></span>

When the old prophet at Bethel heard of this, he said, "It is the man of
God, who was disobedient to the word of the Lord; the Lord hath
delivered him to the lion, so that it hath torn him (שׁבר, frangere,
confringere, used of a lion which tears its prey in pieces) and slain
him according to the word of the Lord, which He spake to him."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 13:27</span></span>

He thereupon had his ass saddled, and went and found the corpse and the
ass standing by it, without the lion having eaten the corpse or torn the
ass in pieces; and he lifted the corpse upon his ass, and brought it
into his own city, and laid the corpse in his grave with the customary
lamentation: אחו הוי, alas, my brother! (cf., [Jer
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018).md), and then gave this command to
his sons: "When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is
buried, let my bones rest beside his bones; for the word which he
proclaimed in the word of Jehovah upon the altar at Bethel and upon all
the houses of the high places in the cities of Samaria will take place"
(i.e., will be fulfilled). The expression "cities of Samaria" belongs to
the author of these books, and is used proleptically of the kingdom of
the ten tribes, which did not receive this name till after the building
of the city of Samaria as the capital of the kingdom and the residence
of the kings of Israel ([Kg1 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024).md).
There is a prophetic element in the words "upon all the houses of the
high places," etc., inasmuch as the only other erection at that time
beside the one at Bethel was a temple of the high places at Dan. But
after such a beginning the multiplication of them might be foreseen with
certainty, even without any higher illumination.

The conduct of the old prophet at Bethel appears so strange, that
Josephus and the Chald., and most of the Rabbins and of the earlier
commentators both Catholic and Protestant, have regarded him as a false
prophet, who tried to lay a trap for the prophet from Judah, in order to
counteract the effect of his prophecy upon the king and the people. But
this assumption cannot be reconciled with either the divine revelation
which came to him at the table, announcing to the Judaean prophet the
punishment of his transgression of the commandment of God, and was so
speedily fulfilled ([Kg1 13:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#020).md); or
with the honour which he paid to the dead man after this punishment had
fallen upon him, by burying him in his own grave; and still less with
his confirmation of his declaration concerning the altar at Bethel ([Kg1
13:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#029).md). We must therefore follow
Ephr. Syr., Theodor., Hengstenberg, and others, and regard the old
prophet as a true prophet, who with good intentions, and not "under the
influence of human envy" (Thenius), but impelled by the desire to enter
into a closer relation to the man of God from Judah and to strengthen
himself through his prophetic gifts, urged him to enter his house. The
fact that he made use of sinful means in order to make more sure of
securing the end desired, namely, of the false pretence that he had been
directed by an angel to do this, may be explained, as Hengstenberg
suggests (Dissert. vol. ii. p. 149), on the ground that when Jeroboam
introduced his innovations, he had sinned by keeping silence, and that
the appearance of the Judaean prophet had brought him to a consciousness
of this sin, so that he had been seized with shame on account of his
fall, and was anxious to restore himself to honour in his own eyes and
those of others by intercourse with this witness to the truth. But
however little the lie itself can be excused or justified, we must not
attribute to him alone the consequences by which the lie was followed in
the case of the Judaean prophet. For whilst he chose reprehensible means
of accomplishing what appeared to be a good end, namely, to raise
himself again by intercourse with a true prophet, and had no wish to
injure the other in any way, the Judaean prophet allowed himself to be
seduced to a transgression of the clear and definite prohibition of God
simply by the sensual desire for bodily invigoration by meat and drink,
and had failed to consider that the divine revelation which he had
received could not be repealed by a pretended revelation from an angel,
because the word of God does not contradict itself. He was therefore
obliged to listen to a true revelation from God from the moth of the man
whose pretended revelation from an angel he had too carelessly believed,
namely, to the announcement of punishment for his disobedience towards
the commandment of God, which punishment he immediately afterwards
endured, "for the destruction of the flesh, but for the preservation of
the spirit: [Co1 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005.md)" (Berleb.
Bible). That the punishment fell upon him alone and not upon the old
prophet of Bethel also, and that for apparently a smaller crime, may be
accounted for "not so much from the fact that the old prophet had lied
with a good intention (this might hold good of the other also), as from
the fact that it was needful to deal strictly with the man who had just
received a great and holy commission from the Lord" (O. v. Gerlach). It
is true that no bodily punishment fell upon the old prophet, but this
punishment he received instead, that with his lie he was put to shame,
and that his conscience must have accused him of having occasioned the
death of the man of God from Judah. He was thereby to be cured of his
weakness, that he might give honour to the truth of the testimony of
God. "Thus did the wondrous providence of God know how to direct all
things most gloriously, so that the bodily destruction of the one
contributed to the spiritual and eternal preservation of the soul of the
other" (Berleb. Bible). - Concerning the design of these marvellous
events, H. Witsius has the following remarks in his Miscell. ss. i. p.
118 (ed. nov. 1736): "So many wondrous events all occurring in one
result caused the prophecy against the altar at Bethel to be preserved
in the mouths and memories of all, and the mission of this prophet to
become far more illustrious. Thus, although the falsehood of the old man
of Bethel brought disgrace upon himself, it injured no one but the man
of God whose credulity was too great; and, under the overruling
providence of God, it contributed in the most signal manner to the
confirmation and publication of the truth."

(Note: Compare with this the remark of Theodoret in his quaest. 43 in 3
libr. Reb.: "In my opinion this punishment served to confirm the
declaration concerning the altar. For it was not possible for the
statement of such a man to be concealed: and this was sufficient to fill
with terror those who heard it; for if partaking of food contrary to the
command of God, and that not of his own accord, but under a deception,
brought such retribution upon a righteous man, to what punishments would
they be exposed who had forsaken the God who made them, and worshipped
the likenesses of irrational creatures?")

The heaping up of the marvellous corresponded to the great object of the
mission of the man of God out of Judah, through which the Lord would
enter an energetic protest against the idolatrous worship of Jeroboam at
its first introduction, to guard those who feared God in Israel, of whom
there were not a few ([Ch2 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016.md); [Kg2
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#003.md); [Kg2
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#018).md), from falling away from Him by
joining in the worship of the calves, and to take away every excuse from
the ungodly who participated therein.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 13:33</span></span>

But this did not lead Jeroboam to conversion. He turned not from his
evil way, but continued to make high priests from the mass of the
people. ויּעשׂ ויּשׁב, "he returned and made," i.e., he made again or
continued to make. For the fact itself compare [Kg1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031.md). "Whoever had pleasure (החפץ,
cf., Ges. 109), he filled his hand, that he might become a priest of the
high places." מלּא את־ידו, to fill the hand, is the technical expression
for investing with the priesthood, according to the rite prescribed for
the consecration of the priests, namely, to place sacrificial gifts in
the hands of the persons to be consecrated (see at [Lev
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#037.md) and [Lev
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#025)..md). The plural בּמות כּהני is used
with indefinite generality: that he might be ranked among the priests of
high places.

[Kg1 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#034.md)

"And it became in (with) this thing the sin of the house of Jeroboam,
and the destroying and cutting off from the earth;" that is to say, this
obstinate persistence in ungodly conduct was the guilt which had as its
natural consequence the destroying of his house from the face of the
earth. הזּה בּדּבר is not a mistake for הזּה הדּבר, but בּ is used, as
in [Ch1 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#033.md); [Ch1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#023.md), to express the idea of being and
persisting in a thing (for this use of בּ compare Ewald, 295, f.).
