### [Proverbs Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 22:1</span></span>

[Pro 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md)

1 A good name has the preference above great riches;

For more than silver and gold is grace.

The proverb is constructed chiastically; the commencing word נבחר (cf.
[Pro 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003).md), and the concluding word
טוב, are the parallel predicates; rightly, none of the old translators
have been misled to take together חן טוב, after the analogy of שׂכל טוב,
[Pro 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014.md); [Pro
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#015.md). שׁם also does not need טוב for
nearer determination; the more modern idiom uses שׁם טוב,

(Note: e.g., Aboth iv. 17: there are three crowns: the crown of the Tra,
the crown of the priesthood, and the crown of royalty; but כתר שׁם טוב,
the crown of a good name, excels them all.)

the more ancient uses שׁם alone (e.g., [Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001).md), in the sense of ὄνομα καλόν
(thus here lxx); for being well known (renowned) is equivalent to a
name, and the contrary to being nameless ([Job
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008).md); to make oneself a name, is
equivalent to build a monument in honour of oneself; possibly the
derivation of the word from שׁמה, to be high, prominent, known, may have
contributed to this meaning of the word sensu eximio, for שׁם has the
same root word as שׁמים. Luther translates שׁם by Das Gercht \[rumour,
fame\], in the same pregnant sense; even to the present day, renom,
recomme, riputazione, and the like, are thus used. The parallel חן
signifies grace and favour (being beloved); grace, which brings favour
([Pro 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#016).md); and favour, which is the
consequence of a graceful appearance, courtesy, and demeanour (e.g.,
[Est 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015).md).

[Pro 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002.md)

2 The rich and the poor meet together;

The creator of them all is Jahve.

From this, that God made them all, i.e., rich and poor in the totality
of their individuals, it follows that the meeting together is His will
and His ordinance; they shall in life push one against another, and for
what other purpose than that this relationship of mutual intercourse
should be a school of virtue: the poor shall not envy the rich ([Pro
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031).md), and the rich shall not despise
the poor, who has the same God and Father as himself ([Pro
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031.md); [Pro
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md); [Pro
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#015).md); they shall remain conscious of
this, that the intermingling of the diversities of station is for this
end, that the lowly should serve the exalted, and the exalted should
serve the lowly. [Pro 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#013.md) is a
variation; there also for both, but particularly for the rich, lies in
the proverb a solemn warning.

[Proverbs 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 22:3</span></span>

The group of proverbs beginning here terminates at [Pro
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#007.md), where, like the preceding, it
closes with a proverb of the rich and the poor.

3 The prudent seeth the evil, and hideth himself;

But the simple go forward, and suffer injury.

This proverb repeats itself with insignificant variations, [Pro
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#012.md). The Kerı̂ ונסתּר makes it more
conformable to the words there used. The Chethı̂b is not to be read
ויסתּר, for this Kal is inusit., but ויסּתר, or much rather ויּסּתר,
since it is intended to be said what immediate consequence on the part
of a prudent man arises from his perceiving an evil standing before him;
he sees, e.g., the approaching overthrow of a decaying house, or in a
sudden storm the fearful flood, and betimes betakes himself to a place
of safety; the simple, on the contrary, go blindly forward into the
threatening danger, and must bear the punishment of their carelessness.
The fut. consec. 3a denotes the hiding of oneself as that which
immediately follows from the being observant; the two perf. 3b, on the
other hand, with or without ו, denote the going forward and meeting with
punishment as occurring contemporaneously (cf. [Psa
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#006.md), and regarding these diverse
forms of construction, at [Hab 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010).md).
"The interchange of the sing. and plur. gives us to understand that
several or many simple ones are found for one prudent man" (Hitzig). The
Niph. of ענשׁ signifies properly to be punished by pecuniary fine ([Exo
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#022).md) (cf. the post-bibl. קנס, קנס,
to threaten punishment, which appears to have arisen from censere, to
estimate, to lay on taxes); here it has the general meaning of being
punished, viz., of the self-punishment of want of foresight.

[Proverbs 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 22:4</span></span>

4 The reward of humility is the fear of Jahve,

Is riches, and honour, and life.

As ענוה־צדק, [Psa 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#005.md), is understood
of the two virtues, meekness and righteousness, so here the three
Gttingen divines (Ewald, Bertheau, and Elster), as also Dunasch, see in
'ענוה יראת ה an asyndeton; the poet would then have omitted vav, because
instead of the copulative connection he preferred the appositional
(Schultens: praemium mansuetudinis quae est reverentia Jehovae) or the
permutative (the reward of humility; more accurately expressed: the fear
of God). It is in favour of this interpretation that the verse following
([Pro 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#005).md) also shows an asyndeton.
Luther otherwise: where one abides in the fear of the Lord; and
Oetinger: the reward of humility, endurance, calmness in the fear of the
Lord, is...; Fleischer also interprets 'יראת ה as [Pro
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#004), חטאת (lucerna impiroum vitiosa.md),
as the accus. of the nearer definition. But then is the nearest-lying
construction: the reward of humility is the fear of God, as all old
interpreters understand 4a (e.g., Symmachus, ὕστερον πραΰ́τητος φόβος
κυρίου), a thought so incomprehensible, that one must adopt one or other
of these expedients? On the one side, we may indeed say that the fear of
God brings humility with it; but, on the other hand, it is just as
conformable to experience that the fear of God is a consequence of
humility; for actually to subordinate oneself to God, and to give honour
to Him alone, one must have broken his self-will, and come to the
knowledge of himself in his dependence, nothingness, and sin; and one
consequence by which humility is rewarded, may be called the fear of
God, because it is the root of all wisdom, or as is here said (cf. [Pro
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md); [Pro
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#018).md), because riches, and honour, and
life are in its train. Thus 4a is a concluded sentence, which in 4b is
so continued, that from 4a the predicate is to be continued: the reward
of humility is the fear of God; it is at the same time riches... Hitzig
conjectures 'ראוּת ה, the beholding Jahve; but the visio Dei (beatifica)
is not a dogmatic idea thus expressed in the O.T. עקב denotes what
follows a thing, from עקב, to tread on the heels (Fleischer); for עקב
(Arab. 'aḳib) is the heels, as the incurvation of the foot; and עקב, the
consequence (cf. Arab. 'aḳb, 'ukb, posteritas), is mediated through the
v. denom. עקב, to tread on the heels, to follow on the heels (cf.
denominatives, such as Arab. batn, zahr, 'ân, עין, to strike the body,
the back, the eye).

[Proverbs 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 22:5</span></span>

5 Thorns, snares, are on the way of the crooked;

He that guardeth his soul, let him keep far from them.

Rightly the Venet. ἄκανθαι παγίδες ἐν ὁδῷ στρεβλοῦ. The meaning of צנּים
(plur. of צן, or צנּה, the same as צנינים) and פּחים (from פּח, Arab.
faḥ), stands fast, though it be not etymologically verified; the placing
together of these two words (the lxx obliterating the asyndeton:
τρίβολος καὶ παγίδες) follows the scheme שׁמשׁ ירח, [Hab
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#011.md). The עקּשׁ־לב (perverse of heart,
crooked, [Pro 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020.md); [Pro
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#020).md) drives his crooked winding way,
corresponding to his habit of mind, which is the contrast and the
perversion of that which is just, a way in which there are thorns which
entangle and wound those who enter thereon, snares which unexpectedly
bring them down and hold them fast as prisoners; the hedge of thorns,
[Pro 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#019.md), was a figure of the
hindrances in the way of the wicked themselves. The thorn and snares
here are a figure of the hindrances and dangers which go forth from the
deceitful and the false in the way of others, of those who keep their
souls, i.e., who outwardly and morally take heed to their life ([Pro
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#017.md); [Pro
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#003), pred. here subj..md), who will
keep, or are disposed to keep, themselves from these thorns, these
snares into which the deceitful and perverse-hearted seek to entice
them.

[Proverbs 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 22:6</span></span>

6 Give to the child instruction conformably to His way;

So he will not, when he becomes old, depart from it.

The first instruction is meant which, communicated to the child, should
be על־פּי, after the measure ([Gen
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#007) = post-bibl. לפי and כּפי.md) of his
way, i.e., not: of his calling, which he must by and by enter upon
(Bertheau, Zckler), which דּרכּו of itself cannot mean; also not: of the
way which he must keep in during life (Kidduschin 30a); nor: of his
individual nature (Elster); but: of the nature of the child as such, for
דּרך נער is the child's way, as e.g., derek col-haarets, [Gen
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#031.md), the general custom of the land;
derek Mitsrâyim, [Isa 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md), the way
(the manner of acting) of the Egyptians. The instruction of youth, the
education of youth, ought to be conformed to the nature of youth; the
matter of instruction, the manner of instruction, ought to regulate
itself according to the stage of life, and its peculiarities; the method
ought to be arranged according to the degree of development which the
mental and bodily life of the youth has arrived at. The verb חנך is a
denominative like עקב, [Pro 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#004.md); it
signifies to affect the taste, חך (= חנך), in the Arab. to put date
syrup into the mouth of the suckling; so that we may compare with it the
saying of Horace, Ep. i. 2, 69: Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit
odorem Testa diu. In the post-bibl. Heb. חנּוּך denotes that which in
the language of the Church is called catechizatio; חנוך (לנער) ספר is
the usual title of the catechisms. It is the fundamental and first
requisite of all educational instruction which the proverb formulates, a
suitable motto for the lesson-books of pedagogues and catechists. ממּנּה
\[from it\] refers to that training of youth, in conformity with his
nature, which becomes a second nature, that which is imprinted, inbred,
becomes accustomed. [Pro 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#006.md) is
wanting in the lxx; where it exists in MSS of the lxx, it is supplied
from Theodotion; the Complut. translates independently from the Heb.
text.

[Proverbs 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 22:7</span></span>

7 A rich man will rule over the poor,

And the borrower is subject to the man who lends.

"This is the course of the world. As regards the sing. and plur. in 7a,
there are many poor for one rich; and in the Orient the rule is
generally in the hands of one" (Hitzig). The fut. denotes how it will
and must happen, and the substantival clause 7b, which as such is an
expression of continuance (Arab. thabât, i.e., of the remaining and
continuing), denotes that contracting of debt brings naturally with it a
slavish relation of dependence. לוה, properly he who binds himself to
one se ei obligat, and מלוה, as [Pro
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017) (vid., l.c..md), qui alterum (mutui
datione) obligat, from לוה, Arab. lwy, to wind, turn, twist round (cog.
root laff), whence with Fleischer is also to be derived the Aram. לות,
"into connection;" so אל, properly "pushing against," refers to the
radically related אלה (= ולה), contiguum esse. אישׁ מלוה is one who puts
himself in the way of lending, although not directly in a professional
manner. The pred. precedes its subject according to rule. Luther rightly
translates: and he who borrows is the lender's servant, whence the pun
on the proper names: "Borghart \[= the borrower\] is Lehnhart's \[=
lender's\] servant."

[Proverbs 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 22:8</span></span>

The group now following extends to the end of this first collection of
Solomon's proverbs; it closes also with a proverb of the poor and the
rich.

8 He that soweth iniquity shall reap calamity;

And the rod of his fury shall vanish away.

"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" ([Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007).md); he that soweth good reapeth
good, [Pro 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018.md); he that soweth evil
reapeth evil, [Job 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008.md); cf. [Hos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md). עולה is the direct contrast of
צדקה or ישׁר (e.g., [Psa 125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003.md); [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042).md), proceeding from the idea that
the good is right, i.e., straight, rectum; the evil, that which departs
from the straight line, and is crooked. Regarding און, which means both
perversity of mind and conduct, as well as destiny, calamity, vid., [Pro
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#021.md). That which the poet
particularly means by עולה is shown in 8b, viz., unsympathizing tyranny,
cruel misconduct toward a neighbour. שׁבט עברתו is the rod which he who
soweth iniquity makes another to feel in his anger. The saying, that an
end will be to this rod of his fury, agrees with that which is said of
the despot's sceptre, [Isa 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005.md).; [Psa
125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003.md). Rightly Fleischer: baculus
insolentiae ejus consumetur h. e. facultas qua pollet alios insolenter
tractandi evanescet. Hitzig's objection, that a rod does not vanish
away, but is broken, is answered by this, that the rod is thought of as
brandished; besides, one uses כּלה of anything which has an end, e.g.,
[Isa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004.md). Other interpreters
understand "the rod of his fury" of the rod of God's anger, which will
strike the עוּל and יכלה, as at [Eze
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013.md); [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md) : "and the rod of His punishment
will surely come" (Ewald, and similarly Schultens, Euchel, Umbreit).
This though also hovers before the lxx: πληγὴν δὲ ἔργων αὐτοῦ (עבדתו)
συντελέσει (יכלּה). But if the rod of punishment which is appointed for
the unrighteous be meant, then we would have expected כּלהו. Taken in
the future, the כּלות of the שׁבט is not its confectio in the sense of
completion, but its termination or annihilation; and besides, it lies
nearer after 8a to take the suffix of עברתו subjectively ([Isa
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006.md); [Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006).md) than objectively. The lxx has,
after [Pro 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008.md), a distich: -

ἄνδρα ἱλαρὸν καὶ δότην εὐλογεῖ ὁ θεὸς

ματαιότητα δὲ ἔργων αὐτοῦ συντελέσει.

The first line ([Co2 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007).md) is a variant
translation of 9a (cf. [Pro 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#017).md),
the second (ושׁוא עבדתו) is a similar rendering of 8b.

[Proverbs 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 22:9</span></span>

9 He who is friendly is blessed;

Because he giveth of his bread to the poor.

The thought is the same as at [Pro
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025.md). טוב עין (thus to be written
without Makkeph, with Munach of the first word, with correct Codd., also
1294 and Jaman), the contrast of רע עין, [Pro
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#006.md); [Pro
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022.md), i.e., the envious, evil-eyed,
ungracious (post-bibl. also צר עין), is one who looks kindly, is
good-hearted, and as ἱλαρὸς δότης, shows himself benevolent. Such
gentleness and kindness is called in the Mishna עין טובה (Aboth ii. 13),
or עין יפה. Such a friend is blessed, for he has also himself scattered
blessings (cf. גּם־הוּא, [Pro 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025.md);
[Pro 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#013).md); he has, as is said,
looking back from the blessing that has happened to him, given of his
bread (Luther, as the lxx, with partitive genitive: seines brots = of
his bread) to the poor; cf. the unfolding of this blessing of
self-denying love, Isa 8. The lxx has also here another distich:

Νίκην καὶ τιμὴν περιποιεῖται ὁ δῶρα δοὺς,

Τὴν μέντοι ψυχὴν ἀφαιρεῖται τῶν κεκτημένων.

The first line appears a variant translation of [Pro
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006.md), and the second of [Pro
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019.md), according to which selfishness,
in contrast to liberality, is the subject to be thought of. Ewald
translates the second line: And he (who distributes gifts) conquers the
soul of the recipients. But κεκτημένος = בּעל (בּעלים) signifies the
possessor, not the recipient of anything as a gift, who cannot also be
here meant because of the μέντοι.

[Proverbs 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 22:10</span></span>

10 Chase away the scorner, and contention goeth out,

And strife and reproach rest.

If in a company, a circle of friends, a society (lxx ἔκβαλε ἐκ
συνεδρίου), a wicked man is found who (vid., the definition of לץ, [Pro
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024).md) treats religious questions
without respect, moral questions in a frivolous way, serious things
jestingly, and in his scornful spirit, his passion for witticism, his
love of anecdote, places himself above the duty of showing reverence,
veneration, and respect, there will arise ceaseless contentions and
conflicts. Such a man one ought to chase away; then there will
immediately go forth along with him dispeace (מדון), there will then be
rest from strife and disgrace, viz., of the strife which such a one
draws forth, and the disgrace which it brings on the society, and
continually prepares for it. קלון is commonly understood of the injury,
abuse, which others have to suffer from the scoffer, or also (thus
Fleischer, Hitzig) of the opprobria of the contentious against one
another. But קלון is not so used; it means always disgrace, as something
that happens, an experience, vid., at [Pro
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#003.md). The praise of one who is the
direct contrast of a לץ is celebrated in the next verse.

[Proverbs 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 22:11</span></span>

11 He that loveth heart-purity,

Whose is grace of lips, the king is his friend.

Thus with Hitzig, it is to be translated not: he who loveth with a pure
heart - we may interpret טהור־לב syntactically in the sense of puritate
cordis or purus corde (Ralbag, Ewald, after [Pro
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#007).md), for that which follows אהב and
is its supplement has to stand where possible as the accus. of the
object; thus not: qui amat puritatem cordis, gratiosa erunt labia ejus
(de Dieu, Geier, Schultens, C. B. Michaelis, Fleischer), for between
heart-purity and graciousness of speech there exists a moral relation,
but yet no necessary connection of sequence; also not: he who loves
purity of heart, and grace on his lips (Aben Ezra, Schelling, Bertheau),
for "to love the grace of one's own lips" is an awkward expression,
which sounds more like reprehensible self-complacency than a
praiseworthy endeavour after gracious speech. Excellently Luther:

"He who has a true heart and amiable speech,

The king is his friend."

טהור־לב is not adjectival, but substantival; טהר־ is thus not the
constr. of the mas. טהור, as [Job
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010.md), but of the segolate טהר, or
(since the ground-form of גּבהּ, [Sa1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007), may be גּבהּ as well as גּבהּ.md)
of the neut. טהור, like קדשׁ, [Psa
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md); [Psa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005.md) : that which is pure, the being
pure = purity (Schultens). הן שׂפתיו (gracefulness of his lips) is the
second subject with the force of a relative clause, although not exactly
thus thought of, but: one loving heart-purity, gracefulness on his lips
- the king is his friend. Ewald otherwise: "he will be the king's
friend," after the scheme [Pro 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004.md);
but here unnecessarily refined. A counsellor and associate who is
governed by a pure intention, and connects therewith a gentle and
amiable manner of speech and conversation, attaches the king to himself;
the king is the רעה (רע), the friend of such an one, and he also is "the
friend of the king," [Kg1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#005.md). It is a
Solomonic proverb, the same in idea as [Pro
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#013.md). The lxx, Syr., and Targ.
introduce after אהב the name of God; but 11b does not syntactically
admit of this addition. But it is worth while to take notice of an
interpretation which is proposed by Jewish interpreters: the friend of
such an one is a king, i.e., he can royally rejoice in him and boast of
him. The thought is beautiful; but, as the comparison of other proverbs
speaking of the king shows, is not intended.

[Proverbs 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 22:12</span></span>

12 The eyes of Jahve preserve knowledge;

So he frustrateth the words of the false.

The phrase "to preserve knowledge" is found at [Pro
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002.md); there, in the sense of to keep,
retain; here, of protecting, guarding; for it cannot possibly be said
that the eyes of God keep themselves by the rule of knowledge, and thus
preserve knowledge; this predicate is not in accord with the eyes, and
is, as used of God, even inappropriate. On the other hand, after "to
preserve," in the sense of watching, guarding a concrete object is to be
expected, cf. [Isa 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md). We need not
thus with Ewald supply יודע; the ancients are right that דעת, knowledge,
stands metonymically for אישׁ (Meri), or אנשׁי (Aben Ezra), or יודעי דעת
(Arama); Schultens rightly: Cognitio veritatis ac virtutis practica
fertur ad homines eam colentes ac praestantes. Where knowledge of the
true and the good exists, there does it stand under the protection of
God. 12b shows how that is meant, for there the perf. is continued in
the second consec. modus (fut. consec.): there is thus protection
against the assaults of enemies who oppose the knowledge which they
hate, and seek to triumph over it, and to suppress it by their crooked
policy. But God stands on the side of knowledge and protects it, and
consequently makes vain the words (the outspoken resolutions) of the
deceitful. Regarding סלף (סלף), vid., [Pro
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003.md) and [Pro
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003.md). The meaning of סלּף דּברי is
here essentially different from that in [Exo
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#008.md); [Deu
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#019.md) : he perverteth their words, for
he giveth them a bearing that is false, i.e., not leading to the end.
Hitzig reads רעות \[wickedness\] for דעת, which Zckler is inclined to
favour: God keeps the evil which is done in His eyes, and hinders its
success; but "to observe wickedness" is an ambiguous, untenable
expression; the only passage that can be quoted in favour of this "to
observe" is [Job 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020.md). The word דעת,
handed down without variation, is much rather justified.

[Proverbs 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 22:13</span></span>

13 The sluggard saith, "A lion is without,

I shall be slain in the midst of the streets."

Otherwise rendered, [Pro 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#013.md). There,
as here, the perf. אמר has the meaning of an abstract present, Gesen.
126. 3. The activity of the industrious has its nearest sphere at home;
but here a work is supposed which requires him to go forth ([Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003).md) into the field ([Pro
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#027).md). Therefore חוּץ stands first, a
word of wide signification, which here denotes the open country outside
the city, where the sluggard fears to meet a lion, as in the streets,
i.e., the rows of houses forming them, to meet a רצח (מרצּח), i.e., a
murder from motives of robbery of revenge. This strong word, properly to
destroy, crush, Arab. raḍkh, is intentionally chosen: there is designed
to be set forth the ridiculous hyperbolical pretence which the sluggard
seeks for his slothfulness (Fleischer). Luther right well: "I might be
murdered on the streets." But there is intentionally the absence of
אוּלי \[perhaps\] and of פּן \[lest\]. Meri here quotes a passage of the
moralists: ממופתי העצל הנבואה (prophesying) belongs to the evidences of
the sluggard; and Euchel, the proverb העצלים מתנבאים (the sluggard's
prophecy), i.e., the sluggard acts like a prophet, that he may palliate
his slothfulness.

[Proverbs 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 22:14</span></span>

14 A deep pit is the mouth of a strange woman;

He that is cursed of God falleth therein.

The first line appears in a different form as a synonymous distich, [Pro
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#027.md). The lxx translate στόμα
παρανόμου without certainly indicating which word they here read,
whether רע ([Pro 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#014).md), or רשׁע ([Pro
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#012).md), or נלוז ([Pro
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032).md). [Pro
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#027.md) is adduced in support of זרות
(vid., [Pro 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016)); זנות (harlots.md) are
meant, and it is not necessary thus to read with Ewald. The mouth of
this strange woman or depraved Israelitess is a deep ditch (שׁוּחה
עמקּה, otherwise עמקה, as [Pro 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#027.md),
where also occurs עמוּקה

(Note: The text to Immanuel's Comment. (Naples 1487) has in both
instances עמוּקה.)

namely, a snare-pit into which he is enticed by her wanton words; the
man who stands in fellowship with God is armed against this syren voice;
but the 'זעוּם ה, i.e., he who is an object of the divine זעם (Venet.
κεχολωμένος τῷ ὀντωτῇ), indignation, punishing evil with evil, falls
into the pit, yielding to the seduction and the ruin. Schultens explains
'זעום ה by, is in quem despumat indignabundus; but the meaning despumat
is not substantiated; זעם, cf. Arab. zaghm, is probably a word which by
its sound denoted anger as a hollow roaring, and like pealing thunder.
The lxx has, after [Pro 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014.md), three
tedious moralizing lines.

[Proverbs 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 22:15</span></span>

15 Folly is bound to the heart of a child;

The rod of correction driveth it forth.

Folly, i.e., pleasure in stupid tricks, silly sport, and foolish
behaviour, is the portion of children as such; their heart is as yet
childish, and folly is bound up in it. Education first driveth forth
this childish, foolish nature (for, as Menander says:

Ὁ μὴ δαρεὶς ἄνθρωπος οὐ παιδεύεται),

and if effects this when it is unindulgently severe: the שׁבט מוּסר
(vid., [Pro 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#013).md) removeth אוּלת from
the heart, for it imparts intelligence and makes wise ([Pro
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#015).md). The lxx is right in rendering
16a: ἄνοια ἐξῆπται (from ἐξάπτειν) καρδίας νέου; but the Syr. has "here
mangled the lxx, and in haste has read ἀνοίᾳ ἐξίπταται: folly makes the
understanding of the child fly away" (Lagarde).

[Proverbs 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 22:16</span></span>

16 Whosoever oppresseth the lowly, it is gain to him;

Whosoever giveth to the rich, it is only loss.

It is before all clear that להרבּות and למחסור, as at [Pro
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005.md), למותר and למחסור, are contrasted
words, and form the conclusions to the participles used, with the force
of hypothetical antecedents. Jerome recognises this: qui calumniatur
pauperem, ut augeat divitias suas, dabit ipse ditiori et egebit. So
Rashi, who by עשׁיר thinks on heathen potentates. Proportionally better
Euchel, referring עשׁק and נתן, not to one person, but to two classes of
men: he who oppresses the poor to enrich himself, and is liberal toward
the rich, falls under want. The antithetic distich thus becomes an
integral one - the antithesis manifestly intended is not brought out.
This may be said also against Bertheau, who too ingeniously explains: He
who oppresses the poor to enrich himself gives to a rich man, i.e., to
himself, the enriched, only to want, i.e., only to lose again that which
he gained unrighteously. Ralbag is on the right track, for he suggests
the explanation: he who oppresses the poor, does it to his gain, for he
thereby impels him to a more energetic exercise of his strength; he who
gives to the rich man does it to his own loss, because the rich man does
not thank him for it, and still continues to look down on him. But if
one refers לּו to the poor, then it lies nearer to interpret אך למחסור
of the rich: he who gives presents to the rich only thereby promotes his
sleepy indolence, and so much the more robs him of activity (Elster);
for that which one gives to him is only swallowed up in the whirlpool of
his extravagance (Zckler). Thus Hitzig also explains, who remarks, under
17a: "Oppression produces reaction, awakens energy, and thus God on the
whole overrules events" ([Exo 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#012).md).
Similarly also Ewald, who thinks on a mercenary, unrighteous rich man:
God finally lifts up the oppressed poor man; the rich man always
becoming richer, on the contrary, is "punished for all his wickedness
only more and more." But with all these explanations there is too much
read between the lines. Since אך למחדור ([Pro
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024.md); [Pro
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005).md) refers back to the subject:
himself to mere loss, so also will it be here; and the lxx, Symmachus,
Jerome (cf. also the Syr. auget malum suum) are right when they also
refer לו, not to the poor man, but to the oppressor of the poor. We
explain: he who extorts from the poor enriches himself thereby; but he
who gives to the rich has nothing, and less than nothing, thereby - he
robs himself, has no thanks, only brings himself by many gifts lower and
lower down. In the first case at least, 17a, the result corresponds to
the intention; but in this latter case, 17b, one gains only bitter
disappointment.

[Proverbs 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 22:17</span></span>

[Pro 22:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md), forming the
introduction to this appendix, are these Words of the Wise:

17 Incline thine ear and hear the words of the wise,

And direct thine heart to my knowledge!

18 For it is pleasant if thou keep them in thine heart;

Let them abide together on thy lips.

19 That thy trust may be placed in Jahve,

I have taught thee to-day, even thee!

20 Have not I written unto thee choice proverbs,

Containing counsels and knowledge,

21 To make thee to know the rule of the words of truth,

That thou mightest bring back words which are truth to them that send
thee?

From [Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md) to [Pro
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016.md) are the "Proverbs of Solomon,"
and not "The Words of the Wise;" thus the above παραίνεσις is not an
epilogue, but a prologue to the following proverbs. The perfects
הודעתּיך and כתבתּי refer, not to the Solomonic proverbial discourses,
but to the appendix following them; the preface commends the worth and
intention of this appendix, and uses perfects because it was written
after the forming of the collection. The author of this preface (vid.,
pp. 23, 36, vol. i.) is no other than the author of chap. 1-9. The הט
(with Mehuppach, after Thorath Emeth, p. 27) reminds us of [Pro
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#020.md); [Pro
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001.md). The phrase שׁית לב, animum
advertere, occurs again in the second appendix, [Pro
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#032.md). נעים is repeated at [Pro
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#008.md); [Pro
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#004.md); but נעם with נעם is common in
the preface, chap. 1-9. כּי־נעים contains, as at [Psa
135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003.md); [Psa
147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md), its subject in itself.
כּי־תּשׁמרם is not this subject: this that thou preservest them, which
would have required rather the infin. שׁמרם ([Psa
133:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001).md) or לשׁמרם; but it supposes the
case in which appears that which is amiable and praiseworthy: if thou
preservest them in thy heart, i.e., makest them thoughtfully become thy
mental possession. The suffix ēm refers to the Words of the Wise, and
mediately also to לדעתּי, for the author designates his practical wisdom
דעתי, which is laid down in the following proverbs, which, although not
composed by him, are yet penetrated by his subjectivity. Regarding בּטן,
which, from meaning the inner parts of the body, is transferred to the
inner parts of the mind, vid., under [Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md). The clause 18b, if not
dependent on כי, would begin with ויכּנוּ. The absence of the copula and
the antecedence of the verb bring the optative rendering nearer.
Different is the syntactical relation of [Pro
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002.md), where the infin. is continued in
the fin. The fut. Niph. יכּנוּ, which, [Pro
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027.md), meant to be rightly placed,
rightly directed, here means: to stand erect, to have continuance,
stabilem esse. In [Pro 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#019.md), the fact
of instruction precedes the statement of its object, which is, that the
disciple may place his confidence in Jahve, for he does that which is
according to His will, and is subject to His rule. מבטחך, in Codd. and
correct editions with Pathach (vid., Michlol 184b); the ח is as
virtually doubled; vid., under [Pro
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#022.md). In 19b the accentuation הודעתיך
היום is contrary to the syntax; Codd. and old editions have rightly
הודעתיך היום, for אף־אתּה is, after Gesen. 121. 3, an emphatic
repetition of "thee;" אף, like גּם, [Pro
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#015.md); [Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md). Hitzig knows of no contrast
which justifies the emphasis. But the prominence thus effected is not
always of the nature of contrast (cf. [Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005.md), have ye truly fasted to me, i.e.,
to serve me thereby), here it is strong individualizing; the te etiam te
is equivalent to, thee as others, and thee in particular. Also that, as
Hitzig remarks, there does not appear any reason for the emphasizing of
"to-day," is incorrect: היּום is of the same signification as at [Psa
95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007.md); the reader of the following
proverbs shall remember later, not merely in general, that he once on a
time read them, but that he to-day, that he on this definite day,
received the lessons of wisdom contained therein, and then, from that
time forth, became responsible for his obedience or his disobedience.

In 20a the Chethı̂b שלשום denotes no definite date; besides, this word
occurs only always along with תּמול (עתמול). Umbreit, Ewald, Bertheau,
however, accept this "formerly (lately)," and suppose that the author
here refers to a "Book for Youths," composed at an earlier period,
without one seeing what this reference, which had a meaning only for his
contemporaries, here denotes. The lxx reads כתבתּ, and finds in 20a,
contrary to the syntax and the usus loq., the exhortation that he who is
addressed ought to write these good doctrines thrice (τρισσῶς) on the
tablet of his heart; the Syr. and Targ. suppose the author to say that
he wrote them three times; Jerome, that he wrote them threefold - both
without any visible meaning, since threefold cannot be equivalent to
manchfeltiglich (Luther) \[= several times, in various ways\]. Also the
Kerı̂ שׁלשׁים, which without doubt is the authentic word, is interpreted
in many unacceptable ways; Rashi and Elia Wilna, following a Midrash
explanation, think on the lessons of the Law, the Prophets, and the
Hagiographa; Arama, on those which are referable to three classes of
youth; Malbim (as if here the author of the whole Book of Proverbs, from
1 to 31, spake), on the supposed three chief parts of the Mishle; Dchsel
better, on chap. 1-9, as the product of the same author as this
appendix. Schultens compares [Ecc
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#012.md), and translates triplici filo
nexa. Kimchi, Meri, and others, are right, who gloss שׁלישׁים by דברים
נכבדים, and compare נגידים, [Pro 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006.md);
accordingly the Veneta, with the happy quid pro quo, by τρισμέγιστα. The
lxx translates the military שׁלישׁ by τριστάτης; but this Greek word is
itself obscure, and is explained by Hesychius (as well as by Suidas, and
in the Etymologicum) by Regii satellites qui ternas hastas manu
tenebant, which is certainly false. Another Greek, whom Angellius
quotes, says, under [Exo 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#004.md), that
τριστάτης was the name given to the warriors who fought from a chariot,
every three of whom had one war-chariot among them; and this appears,
according to [Exo 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007.md); [Exo
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#004.md), to be really the primary
meaning. In the period of David we meet with the word שׁלישׁים as the
name of the heroes (the Gibbôrı̂m) who stood nearest the king. The
shalish-men form the lite troops that stood highest in rank, at whose
head stood two triads of heroes - Jashobeam at the head of the first
trias, and thus of the shalish-men generally; Abishai at the head of the
second trias, who held an honourable place among the shalish-men, but
yet reached not to that first trias, [Sa2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008.md). (= [Ch1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#011)..md). The name השּׁלישׁים (Apoc.
[Sa2 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008.md), השּׁלשׁי, and [Sa2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#013.md), [Ch1
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#006), incorrectly השּׁלשׁים.md) occurs
here with reference to the threefold division of this principal host;
and in regard to the use of the word in the time of Pharaoh, as well as
in the time of the kings, it may be granted that shalish denotes the
Three-man (triumvir), and then generally a high military officer; so
that שׁלשׁים here has the same relation to נגידים, [Pro
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006.md), as ducalia to principalia. The
name of the chief men (members of the chief troop) is transferred to the
chief proverbs, as, [Jam 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md), that law
which stands as a king at the head of all the others is called the
"royal law;" or, as Plato names the chief powers of the soul, μέρη
ἡγεμόνες. As in this Platonic word-form, so shalishim here, like negidim
there, is understood neut. cf. under [Pro
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006.md), and ריקים, [Pro
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#011.md); ישׁרים, [Pro
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#013.md). The ב of בּמעצות (occurring at
[Pro 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031) also.md) Fleischer rightly
explains as the ב of uniting or accompanying: chief proverbs which
contain good counsels and solid knowledge.

In the statement of the object in [Pro
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#021.md), we interpret that which follows
להודיעך not permutat.: ut te docerem recta, verba vera (Fleischer); but
קשׁט (ground-form to קשׁט, [Psa 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006).md)
is the bearer of the threefold idea: rectitudinem, or, better, regulam
verborum veritatis. The (Arab.) verb ḳasiṭa means to be straight, stiff,
inflexible (synon. צדק, to be hard, tight, proportionately direct); and
the name ḳisṭ denotes not only the right conduct, the right measure
(quantitas justa), but also the balance, and thus the rule or the norm.
In 21b, אמרים אמת (as e.g., [Zac 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013.md);
vid., Philippi, Status Constr. p. 86f.) is equivalent to אמרי אמת; the
author has this second time intentionally chosen the appositional
relation of connection: words which are truth; the idea of truth
presents itself in this form of expression more prominently. Impossible,
because contrary to the usus loq., is the translation: ut respondeas
verba vera iis qui ad te mittunt (Schultens, Fleischer), because שׁלח,
with the accus. following, never means "to send any one." Without doubt
השׁיב and שׁלח stand in correlation to each other: he who lets himself
be instructed must be supposed to be in circumstances to bring home, to
those that sent him out to learn, doctrines which are truth, and thus to
approve himself. The subject spoken of here is not a right answer or a
true report brought back to one giving a commission; and it lies beyond
the purpose and power of the following proverbs to afford a universal
means whereby persons sent out are made skilful. The שׁלחים \[senders\]
are here the parents or guardians who send him who is to be instructed
to the school of the teacher of wisdom (Hitzig). Yet it appears strange
that he who is the learner is just here not addressed as "my son," which
would go to the support of the expression, "to send to school," which is
elsewhere unused in Old Hebrew, and the שׁלחי of another are elsewhere
called those who make him their mandatar, [Pro
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026.md); [Pro
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013.md); [Sa2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#013.md). The reference to the parents
would also be excluded if, with Norzi and other editors, לשׁלחך were to
be read instead of לשׁלחיך (the Venet. 1521, and most editions).
Therefore the phrase לשׁעליך, which is preferred by Ewald, recommends
itself, according to which the lxx translates, τοῖς προβαλλομένοις σοι,
which the Syro-Hexap. renders

(Note: The Syr. n. fem. awchda (אוּחדא, [Psa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005), Targ..md) is equivalent to Heb.
חידה, from (Syr.) achd, אחד = אחז, [Neh
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#003.md), to shut up, properly, to lay hold
on and retain; the Arab. akhdhat means magic, incantation; as seizing
and making fast.)

by להנון דאחדין לך אוחדתא yb, i.e., to those who lay problems before
thee (vid., Lagarde). The teacher of wisdom seeks to qualify him who
reads the following proverbs, and permits himself to be influenced by
them, to give the right answer to those who question him and go to him
for counsel, and thus to become himself a teacher of wisdom.

[Proverbs 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 22:22</span></span>

After these ten lines of preliminary exhortation, there now begins the
collection of the "Words of the Wise" thus introduced. A tetrastich
which, in its contents, connects itself with the last proverb of the
Solomonic collection, [Pro 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016.md),
forms the commencement of this collection:

22 Rob not the lowly because he is lowly;

And oppress not the humble in the gate.

23 For Jahve will conduct their cause,

And rob their spoilers of life.

Though it may bring gain, as said [Pro
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016.md), to oppress the דּל, the lowly
or humble, yet at last the oppressor comes to ruin. The poet here warns
against robbing the lowly because he is lowly, and thus without power of
defence, and not to be feared; and against doing injustice to the עני,
the bowed down, and therefore incapable of resisting in the gate, i.e.,
in the court of justice. These poor men have not indeed high human
patrons, but One in heaven to undertake their cause: Jahve will conduct
their cause (יריב ריבם, as at [Pro
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#010).md), i.e., will undertake their
vindication, and be their avenger. דּכּא (דּכּה), Aram. and Arab. daḳḳ
(cf. דּקק, Arab. daḳḳ), signifies to crush anything so that it becomes
broad and flat, figuratively to oppress, synon. עשׁק (Fleischer). The
verb קבע has, in Chald. and Syr., the signification to stick, to fix
(according to which Aquila here translates καθηλοῦν, to nail; Jerome,
configere); and as root-word to קבּעת, the signification to be arched,
like (Arab.) ḳab', to be humpbacked; both significations are here
unsuitable. The connection here requires the meaning to rob; and for
[Mal 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008.md) also, this same meaning is to
be adopted, robbery and taking from one by force (Parchon, Kimchi), not:
to deceive (Khler, Keil), although it might have the sense of robbing by
withholding or refraining from doing that which is due, thus of a
sacrilege committed by omission or deception. The Talm. does not know
the verb קבע in this meaning; but it is variously found as a dialectic
word for גזל.

(Note: Thus Rosch ha-schana 26b: Levi came once to N.N. There a man came
to meet him, and cried out קבען פלניא. Levi knew not what he would say,
and went into the Madrash-house to ask. One answered him: He is a robber
(גזלן) said that one to thee; for it is said in the Scriptures ([Mal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008).md), "Will a man rob God?" etc.
(vid., Wissenschaft Kunst Judenthum, p. 243). In the Midrash, שׁוחר טוב,
to [Psa 57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md), R. Levi says that אתה
קיבע לי is used in the sense of אתה גוזל לי. And in the Midrash
Tanchuma, P. תרומה, R. Levi answers the question, "What is the meaning
of קבע, [Mal 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008.md)?" - It is an Arabic
expression. An Arabian, when he wishes to say to another מה אתה גוזלני,
says instead of it, מה אתה קובעני. Perhaps קבע is cogn. to קבץ; the R.
קב coincides in several groups of languages (also the Turkish ḳb) with
the Lat. capere.)

Schultens' etymological explanation, capitium injicere (after Arab.
ḳab', to draw back and conceal the head), is not satisfactory. The
construction, with the double accus., follows the analogy of הכּהוּ נפשׁ
and the like, Gesen. 139. 2. Regarding the sing. נפשׁ, even where
several are spoken of, vid., under [Pro
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019.md).

[Proverbs 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 22:24</span></span>

Another tetrastich follows:

24 Have no intercourse with an angry man,

And with a furious man go thou not;

25 Lest thou adopt his ways,

And bring destruction upon thy soul.

The Piel רעה, [Jdg 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#020.md), signifies to
make or choose any one as a friend or companion (רעה, רע); the Hithpa.
התרעה (cf. at [Pro 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024).md), to take to
oneself (for oneself) any one as a friend, or to converse with one;
אל־תּתרע sounds like אל־תּשׁתּע, [Isa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md), with Pathach of the closed
syllable from the apocope. The angry man is called בּעל אף, as the
covetous man בּעל נפשׁ, [Pro 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#002.md), and
the mischievous man בּעל מזמּות, [Pro
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#008.md); vid., regarding בּעל at [Pro
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019.md) and [Pro
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#009.md). אישׁ חמות is related superlat.
to אישׁ חמה, [Pro 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#018.md) (cf. [Pro
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022).md), and signifies a hot-head of
the highest degree. לא תבוא is meant as warning (cf. [Pro
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010).md). בּוא את, or בוא עם, [Psa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004.md), to come along with one, is
equivalent to go into fellowship or companionship with one, which is
expressed by הלך את, [Pro 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020.md), as
בוא ב means, [Jos 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#007.md), [Jos
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#012.md), to enter into communion with
one, venire in consuetudinem. This בוא את is not a trace of a more
recent period of the language. Also תּאלף, discas, cannot be an
equivalent for it: Heb. poetry has at all times made use of Aramaisms as
elegancies. אלף, Arab. אלף, ילף, Arab. âlifa, signifies to be entrusted
with anything = to learn (Piel אלּף, to teach, [Job
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015), and in Elihu's speeches.md), or
also to become confidential with one (whence אלּוּף, companion,
confidant, [Pro 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017).md); this אלף is
never a Heb. prose word; the bibl. אלּוּף is only used at a later period
in the sense of teacher. ארחות .reh are the ways, the conduct ([Pro
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#020), etc..md), or manner of life ([Pro
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019).md) which any one enters upon and
follows out, thus manners as well as lot, condition. In the phrase "to
bring destruction," לקח is used as in our phrase Schaden nehmen \[to
suffer injury\]; the ancient language also represented the forced
entrance of one into a state as a being laid hold on, e.g., [Job
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#020.md), cf. [Isa
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008.md); here מוקשׁ is not merely
equivalent to danger (Ewald, falsely: that thou takest not danger for
thy soul), but is equivalent to destruction, sin itself is a snare ([Pro
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#006).md); to bring a snare for oneself is
equivalent to suffer from being ensnared. Whosoever comes into a near
relation with a passionate, furious, man, easily accommodates himself to
his manners, and, hurried forward by him and like him to outbreaks of
anger, which does that which is not right before God, falls into ruinous
complications.

[Proverbs 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 22:26</span></span>

A third distich follows:

26 Be not among those who strike hands,

Among those who become surety for loans.

27 If thou hast nothing to pay,

Why shall he take away thy bed from under thee?

To strike hands is equivalent to, to be responsible to any one for
another, to stake one's goods and honour for him, [Pro
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md); [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015.md); [Pro
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018.md) - in a word, ערב, seq. acc., to
pledge oneself for him ([Gen 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#009).md), or
for the loan received by him, משּׁאה, [Deu
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010.md) (from השּׁה, with ב, of the
person and accus. of the thing: to lend something to one on interest).
The proverb warns against being one of such sureties (write בּערבים with
Cod. 1294, and old impressions such as the Venice, 1521), against acting
as they do; for why wouldest thou come to this, that when thou cast not
pay (שׁלּם, to render a full equivalent reckoning, and, generally, to
pay, [Pro 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#031).md),

(Note: After Ben-Asher, the pointing is אם־אין־לך; while, on the
contrary, Ben-Naphtali prefers אם־אין לך; vid., my Genesis (1869), pp.
74 (under [Gen 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003).md) and 81. So,
without any bearing on the sense, Ben-Asher points למּה with Tarcha,
Ben-Naphtali with Mercha.)

he (the creditor) take away thy bed from under thee? - for, as [Pro
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#016.md) says, thus improvident
suretyships are wont to be punished.

[Proverbs 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 22:28</span></span>

A fourth proverb - a distich - beginning with the warning אל:

28 Remove not the perpetual landmark

Which thy ancestors have set up.

28a = [Pro 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#010.md). Regarding the
inviolability of boundaries established by the law, vid., at [Pro
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#025.md). גּבוּל עולם denotes "the
boundary mark set up from ancient times, the removal of which were a
double transgression, because it is rendered sacred by its antiquity"
(Orelli, p. 76). נסג = סוּג signifies to remove back, Hiph. to shove
back, to move away. אשׁר has the meaning of (ὅριον) ὅ, τι, quippe quod.
Instead of עולם, the Mishna reads, Pea v. 6, עולים, which in the
Jerusalem Gemara one Rabbi understands of those brought up out of Egypt,
another of the poor; for "to rise" (in the world) is a euphemism (לשׁון
כבוד) for "to come down" (be reduced in circumstances).

(Note: As an analogical example, סגּי נהור, seeing clearly = blind.)

[Proverbs 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 22:29</span></span>

After these four proverbs beginning with אל, a new series begins with
the following tristich:

29 Seest thou a man who is expert in his calling -

Before kings may he stand;

Not stand before obscure men;

i.e., he can enter into the service of kings, and needs not to enter
into the service of mean men = he is entitled to claim the highest
official post. חזית, in [Pro 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#012.md) =
[Pro 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#020.md), interchanging with ראית,
is perf. hypotheticum (cf. [Pro 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#010.md);
[Pro 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#016).md): si videris; the
conclusion which might begin with דּע כּי expresses further what he who
sees will have occasion to observe. Rightly Luther: Sihestu einen Man
endelich (vid., at [Pro 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005).md) in
seinem geschefft, u.s.w. = seest thou a man expert in his business,
etc.. מהיר denotes in all the three chief dialects one who is skilful in
a manner not merely by virtue of external artistic ability, but also by
means of intellectual mastery of it. התיצּב לפני, to enter on the
situation of a servant before any one; cf. [Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md); [Job
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md). עמד לפני, [Sa1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#021.md); [Kg1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#008.md). Along with the pausal form
יתיצּב, there is also found in Codd. the form יתיצּב (the ground-form to
יתיצּב, whence that pausal form is lengthened), which Ben-Bileam
defends, for he reckons this word among "the pathachized pausal forms."
חשׁכּים, in contrast to מלכים, are the obscuri = ignobiles. The Targ.
translate the Heb. דּל and אביון by חשׁיך and חשׁוך. Kimchi compares
[Jer 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010.md), where העם הדּלּים is
translated by חשׁיכיּא (cf. [Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md); [Kg2
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012)). חלכּה (חלכּה.md) is the old Heb.
synonym in Ps 10. The poet seems here to transfer the Aram. usus loq.
into the Heb.
