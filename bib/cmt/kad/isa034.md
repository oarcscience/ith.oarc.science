### [Isaiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 34:0</span></span>

Finale of the Judgment upon All the World (More Especially upon Edom);
Redemption of the People of Jehovah - Isaiah 34-35 part vi

These two chapters stand in precisely the same relation to chapters
28-33 as chapters 24-27 to chapters 13-23. In both instances the special
prophecies connected with the history of the prophet's own times are
followed by a comprehensive finale of an apocalyptic character. We feel
that we are carried entirely away from the stage of history. There is no
longer that foreshortening, by which the prophet's perspective was
characterized before the fall of Assyria. The tangible shapes of the
historical present, by which we have been hitherto surrounded, are now
spiritualized into something perfectly ideal. We are transported
directly into the midst of the last things; and the eschatological
vision is less restricted, has greater mystical depth, belongs more to
another sphere, and has altogether more of a New Testament character.
The totally different impression which is thus made by chapters 34-35,
as compared with chapters 28-33, must not cause any misgivings as to the
authenticity of this closing prophecy. The relation in which Jeremiah
and Zephaniah stand to chapters 34 and [Isa
35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md), is quite sufficient to drive
all doubts away. (Read Caspari's article, "Jeremiah a Witness to the
Genuineness of Isaiah 34, and therefore also to the Genuineness of
Isaiah; 13:1-14:23, and [Isa 21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md),"
in the Lutherische Zeitschrift, 1843, 2; and Ngelsbach's Jeremia und
Babylon, pp. 107-113, on the relation of Jer 50-51 more especially to
Isaiah 34-35.) There are many passages in Jeremiah (viz., [Jer
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md), [Jer
25:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022.md); [Jer
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010.md); [Jer
50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027.md), [Jer
50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md); [Jer
51:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#040).md) which cannot be explained in
any other way than on the supposition that Jeremiah had the prophecy of
Isaiah in chapter 34 before him. We cannot escape from the conclusion,
that just as we find Jeremiah introducing earlier prophecies generally
into his cycle of prophecies against the nations, and, in the addresses
already mentioned, borrowing from Amos and Nahum, and placing side by
side with a passage from Amos (compare [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md) with [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002).md) one of a similar character, and
agreeing with Isaiah 34, so he also had Isaiah 34 and [Isa
35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md) before him, and reproduced it
in the same sense as he did other and earlier models. It is equally
certain that [Zep 1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md), and [Zep
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014.md), stand in a dependent relation to
[Isa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md), [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md); just as [Zep
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015.md) was taken from [Isa
47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008.md), and [Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md) fin. and [Isa
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#011.md) from [Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003.md); whilst [Zep
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014.md) also points back to [Isa
13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021.md). We might, indeed, reverse
the relation, and make Jeremiah and Zephaniah into the originals in the
case of the passages mentioned; but this is opposed to the generally
reproductive and secondary character of both these prophets, and also to
the evident features of the passages in question. We might also follow
Movers, De Wette, and Hitzig, who get rid of the testimony of Isaiah by
assuming that the passages resting upon Isaiah 34, and other disputed
prophecies of Isaiah, are interpolated; but this is opposed to the moral
character of all biblical prophecy, and, moreover, it could only apply
to Jeremiah, not to Zephaniah. We must in this case "bring reason into
captivity to obedience" to the external evidence; though internal
evidence also is not wanting to set a seal upon these external proofs.
Just as chapters 24-27 are full of the clearest marks of Isaiah's
authorship, so is it also with chapters 34-35. It is not difficult to
understand the marked contrast which we find between these two closing
prophecies and the historical prophecies of the Assyrian age. These two
closing prophecies were appended to chapters 13-23 and 28-33 at the time
when Isaiah revised the complete collection. They belong to the latest
revelations received by the prophet, to the last steps by which he
reached that ideal height at which he soars in chapters 40-66, and from
which he never descends again to the stage of passing history, which lay
so far beneath. After the fall of Assyria, and when darkness began to
gather on the horizon again, Isaiah broke completely away from his own
times. "The end of all things" became more and more his own true home.
The obscure foreground of his prophecies is no longer Asshur, which he
has done with now so far as prophecy is concerned, but Babel (Babylon).
And the bright centre of his prophecies is not the fall of Asshur (for
this was already prophetically a thing of the past, which had not been
followed by complete salvation), but deliverance from Babylon. And the
bright noon-day background of his prophecies is no longer the realized
idea of the kingdom of prophecy - realized, that is to say, in the one
person of the Messiah, whose form had lost the sharp outlines of
chapters 7-12 even in the prophecies of Hezekiah's time - but the
parousia of Jehovah, which all flesh would see. It was the revelation of
the mystery of the incarnation of God, for which all this was intended
to prepare the way. And there was no other way in which that could be
done, than by completing the perfect portrait of the Messiah in the
light of the ultimate future, so that both the factors in the prophecy
might be assimilated. The spirit of Isaiah, more than that of any other
prophet, was the laboratory of this great process in the history of
revelation. The prophetic cycles in chapters 24-27 and 34-35 stand in
the relation of preludes to it. In chapters 40-66 the process of
assimilation is fully at work, and there is consequently no book of the
Old Testament which has gone so thoroughly into New Testament depths, as
this second part of the collection of Isaiah's prophecies, which
commences with a prediction of the parousia of Jehovah, and ends with
the creation of the new heaven and new earth. Chapters 34 and [Isa
35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md) are, as it were, the first
preparatory chords. Edom here is what Moab was in chapters 24-27. By the
side of Babylon, the empire of the world, whose policy of conquest led
to its enslaving Israel, it represents the world in its hostility to
Israel as the people of Jehovah. For Edom was Israel's brother-nation,
and hated Israel as the chosen people. In this its unbrotherly,
hereditary hatred, it represented the sum-total of all the enemies and
persecutors of the church of Jehovah. The special side-piece to chapter
34 is [Isa 63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md).

[Isaiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 34:1</span></span>

What the prophet here foretells relates to all nations, and to every
individual within them, in their relation to the congregation of
Jehovah. He therefore commences with the appeal in [Isa
34:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md) : "Come near, ye peoples, to
hear; and he nations, attend. Let the earth hear, and that which fills
it, the world, and everything that springs from it. For the indignation
of Jehovah will fall upon all nations, and burning wrath upon all their
host; He has laid the ban upon them, delivered them to the slaughter.
And their slain are cast away, and their corpses - their stench will
arise, and mountains melt with their blood." The summons does not invite
them to look upon the completion of the judgment, but to hear the
prophecy of the future judgment; and it is issued to everything on the
earth, because it would all have to endure the judgment upon the nations
(see at [Isa 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md); [Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010).md). The expression qetseph
layehōvâh implies that Jehovah was ready to execute His wrath (compare
yōm layehōvâh in [Isa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008.md) and [Isa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012).md). The nations that are hostile to
Jehovah are slaughtered, the bodies remain unburied, and the streams of
blood loosen the firm masses of the mountains, so that they melt away.
On the stench of the corpses, compare [Eze
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011.md). Even if châsam, in this
instance, does not mean "to take away the breath with the stench," there
is no doubt that Ezekiel had this prophecy of Isaiah in his mind, when
prophesying of the destruction of Gog and Magog (Ezek 39).

[Isaiah 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 34:4</span></span>

The judgment foretold by Isaiah also belongs to the last things; for it
takes place in connection with the simultaneous destruction of the
present heaven and the present earth."And all the host of the heavens
moulder away, and the heavens are rolled up like a scroll, and all their
host withers as a leaf withers away from the vine, and like withered
leaves from the fig-tree" (Nâmaq, to be dissolved into powdered mother
([Isa 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md); [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024).md); nâgōl (for nâgal, like nâzōl in
[Isa 63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019.md); [Isa
64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002.md), and nârōts in [Ecc
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#006).md), to be rolled up - a term
applied to the cylindrical book-scroll. The heaven, that is to say, the
present system of the universe, breaks up into atoms, and is rolled up
like a book that has been read through; and the stars fall down as a
withered leaf falls from a vine, when it is moved by even the lightest
breeze, or like the withered leaves shaken from the fig-tree. The
expressions are so strong, that they cannot be understood in any other
sense than as relating to the end of the world ([Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md); [Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md); compare [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md). It is not sufficient to say
that "the stars appear to fall to the earth," though even Vitringa gives
this explanation.

When we look, however, at the following kı̄ (for), it undoubtedly appears
strange that the prophet should foretell the passing away of the
heavens, simply because Jehovah judges Edom. But Edom stands here as the
representative of all powers that are hostile to the church of God as
such, and therefore expresses an idea of the deepest and widest cosmical
signification (as [Isa 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021.md) clearly
shows). And it is not only a doctrine of Isaiah himself, but a biblical
doctrine universally, that God will destroy the present world as soon as
the measure of the sin which culminates in unbelief, and in the
persecution of the congregation of the faithful, shall be really full.

[Isaiah 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 34:5</span></span>

If we bear this in mind, we shall not be surprised that the prophet
gives the following reason for the passing away of the present heavens.
"For my sword has become intoxicated in the heaven; behold, it comes
down upon Edom, and upon the people of my ban to judgment. The sword of
Jehovah fills itself with blood, is fattened with fat, with blood of
lambs and he-goats, with kidney-fat of rams; for Jehovah has a sacrifice
in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. And buffaloes fall
with them, and bullocks together with bulls; and their land become
intoxicated with blood, and their dust fattened with fat." Just as in
chapter 63 Jehovah is represented as a treader of the wine-press, and
the nations as the grapes; so here He is represented as offering
sacrifice, and the nations as the animals offered (zebhach: cf., [Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md); [Jer
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010).md); [Eze
39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017.md).: all three passages founded
upon this). Jehovah does not appear here in person as judge, as He does
there, but His sword appears; just as in [Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024.md), the "sword which turned every
way" is mentioned as an independent power standing by the side of the
cherub. The sword is His executioner, which has no sooner drunk deeply
of wrath in heaven, i.e., in the immediate sphere of the Deity
(rivvethâh, an intensive form of the kal, like pittēăch, [Isa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008); Ewald, 120, d.md), than it comes
down in wild intoxication upon Edom, the people of the ban of Jehovah,
i.e., the people upon whom He has laid the ban, and there, as His
instrument of punishment, fills itself with blood, and fattens itself
with fat. הדּשׁנה is the hothpaal = התדּשׁנה, with the ת of the
preformative syllable assimilated (compare הזּכּוּ in [Isa
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md), and אדּמּה in [Isa
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#014).md). The penultimate has the tone,
the nâh being treated as in the plural forms of the future. The dropping
of the dagesh in the שׁ eht ni hse is connected with this. The reading
מחלב, in [Isa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md), is an error that
has been handed down in modern copies (in opposition to both codices and
ancient editions); for חלב (primary form, chilb) is the only form met
with in the Old Testament. The lambs, he-goats, and rams, represent the
Edomitish nation, which is compared to these smaller sacrificial
animals. Edom and Bozrah are also placed side by side in [Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md). The latter was one of the chief
cities of the Edomites ([Gen 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#033.md);
[Amo 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md); [Jer
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md), [Jer
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022).md) - not the Bozrah in Auranitis
(Haurân), however, which is well known in church history, but Bozrah in
the mountains of Edom, upon the same site as the village of Buzaire
(i.e., Minor Bozrah), which is still surrounded by its ruins. In
contrast with the three names of the smaller animals in [Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md), the three names of oxen in [Isa
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#007.md) represent the lords of Edom. They
also will fall, smitten by the sword (yâredū: cf., [Jer
50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027.md); [Jer
51:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#040.md); also [Jer
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015).md). The feast of the sword is so
abundant, that even the earth and the dust of the land of Edom are
satiated with blood and fat.

[Isaiah 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 34:8</span></span>

Thus does Jehovah avenge His church upon Edom. "For Jehovah hath a day
of vengeance, a year of recompense, to contend for Zion. And the brooks
of Edom are turned into pitch, and its dust into brimstone, and its land
becomes burning pitch. Day and night it is not quenched; the smoke of
Edom goes up for ever: it lies waste from generation to generation; no
one passes through it for ever and ever." The one expression, "to
contend for Zion," is like a flash of lightning, throwing light upon the
obscurity of prophecy, both backwards and forwards. A day and a year of
judgment upon Edom (compare [Isa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md);
[Isa 63:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#004).md) would do justice to Zion
against its accusers and persecutors (rı̄bh, vindicare, as in [Isa
51:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#022).md). The everlasting punishment
which would fall upon it is depicted in figures and colours, suggested
by the proximity of Edom to the Dead Sea, and the volcanic character of
this mountainous country. The unquenchable fire (for which compare [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024).md), and the eternally ascending
smoke (cf., [Rev 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#003).md), prove that the
end of all things is referred to. The prophet meant primarily, no doubt,
that the punishment announced would fall upon the land of Edom, and
within its geographical boundaries; but this particular punishment
represented the punishment of all nations, and all men who were
Edomitish in their feelings and conduct towards the congregation of
Jehovah.

[Isaiah 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 34:11</span></span>

The land of Edom, in this geographical and also emblematical sense,
would become a wilderness; the kingdom of Edom would be for ever
destroyed. "And pelican and hedgehog take possession of it, and
eared-owl and raven dwell there; and he stretches over it the measure of
Tohu and the level of Bohu. Its nobles - there is no longer a monarchy
which they elected; and all its princes come to nought." The description
of the ruin, which commences in [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md) with a list of animals that
frequent marshy and solitary regions, is similar to the one in [Isa
13:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md); [Isa
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#023.md) (compare [Zep
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014), which is founded upon this.md).
Isaiah's was the original of all such pictures of ruin which we meet
with in the later prophets. The qippōd is the hedgehog, although we find
it here in the company of birds (from qâphad, to draw one's self
together, to roll up; see [Isa 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#023).md).
קאת is written here with a double kametz, as well as in [Zep
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014.md), according to codd. and Kimchi,
W.B. (Targ. qâth, elsewhere qâq; Saad. and Abulwalid, qûq: see at [Psa
102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007).md). According to well-established
tradition, it is the long-necked pelican, which lives upon fish (the
name is derived either from קוא, to vomit, or, as the construct is קאת,
from a word קאה, formed in imitation of the animal's cry). Yanshūph is
rendered by the Targum qı̄ppōphı̄n (Syr. kafûfo), i.e., eared-owls, which
are frequently mentioned in the Talmud as birds of ill omen (Rashi, or
Berachoth 57b, chouette). As the parallel to qâv, we have אבני (stones)
here instead of משׁקלת, the level, in [Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017.md). It is used in the same sense,
however - namely, to signify the weight used in the plumb or level,
which is suspended by a line. The level and the measure are commonly
employed for the purpose of building up; but here Jehovah is represented
as using these fore the purpose of pulling down (a figure met with even
before the time of Isaiah: vid., [Amo
7:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007.md), cf., [Kg2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013.md); [Lam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008).md), inasmuch as He carries out this
negative reverse of building with the same rigorous exactness as that
with which a builder carries out his well-considered plan, and throws
Edom back into a state of desolation and desert, resembling the
disordered and shapeless chaos of creation (compare [Jer
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md), where tōhū vâbhōhū represents,
as it does here, the state into which a land is reduced by fire). תהוּ
has no dagesh lene; and this is one of the three passages in which the
opening mute is without a dagesh, although the word not only follows,
but is closely connected with, one which has a soft consonant as its
final letter (the others are [Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018.md) and [Eze
23:42](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#042).md). Thus the primeval kingdom with
its early monarchy, which is long preceded that of Israel, is brought to
an end ([Gen 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#031).md). חריה stands at
the head as a kind of protasis. Edom was an elective monarchy; the
hereditary nobility electing the new king. But this would be done no
more. The electoral princes of Edom would come to nothing. Not a trace
would be left of all that had built up the glory of Edom.

[Isaiah 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 34:13</span></span>

The allusion to the monarchy and the lofty electoral dignity leads the
prophet on to the palaces and castles of the land. Starting with these,
he carries out the picture of the ruins in [Isa
34:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013.md). "And the palaces of Edom
break out into thorns, nettles and thistles in its castles; and it
becomes the abode of wild dogs, pasture for ostriches. And martens meet
with jackals, and a wood-devil runs upon its fellow; yea, Liiliith
dwells there, and finds rest for itself. There the arrow-snake makes its
nest, and breeds and lays eggs, and broods in the shadow there; yea,
there vultures gather together one to another." The feminine suffixes
refer to Edom, as they did in the previous instance, as בּת־אדום or אדום
ארץ. On the tannı̄m, tsiyyı̄m, and 'iyyı̄m, see at [Isa
13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021.md). It is doubtful whether
châtsı̄r here corresponds to the Arabic word for an enclosure (= חצר), as
Gesenius, Hitzig, and others suppose, as elsewhere to the Arabic for
green, a green field, or garden vegetable. We take it in the latter
sense, viz., a grassy place, such as was frequented by ostriches, which
live upon plants and fruits. The word tsiyyim (steppe animals) we have
rendered "martens," as the context requires a particular species of
animals to be named. This is the interpretation given by Rashi (in loc.)
and Kimchi in [Jer 50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md) to the Targum
word tamvân. We do not render 'iyyı̄m "wild cats" (chattūilin), but
"jackals," after the Arabic. קרא with על we take in the sense of קרה (as
in [Exo 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003).md). Lı̄lı̄th (Syr. and Zab.
lelitho), lit., the creature of the night, was a female demon (shēdâh)
of the popular mythology; according to the legends, it was a malicious
fairy that was especially hurtful to children, like some of the fairies
of our own fairy tales. There is life in Edom still; but what a
caricature of that which once was there! In the very spot where the
princes of Edom used to proclaim the new king, satyrs now invite one
another to dance ([Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021).md); and
there kings and princes once slept in their palaces and country houses,
the lı̄lı̄th, which is most at home in horrible places, finds, as though
after a prolonged search, the most convenient and most comfortable
resting-place. Demons and serpents are not very far distant from one
another. The prophet therefore proceeds in [Isa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015.md) to the arrow-snake, or
springing-snake (Arabic qiffâze, from qâphaz, related to qâphats, [Sol
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md), to prepare for springing, or to
spring; a different word from qippōd, which has the same root). This
builds its nest in the ruins; there it breeds (millēt, to let its eggs
slide out) and lays eggs (bâqa‛, to split, i.e., to bring forth); and
then it broods in the shade (dâgar is the Targum word in [Job
39:14](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#014.md) for chimmēm (ithpael in [Lam
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020) for חמרמר.md), and is also used in
the rabbinical writings for fovere, as Jerome renders it here). The
literal sense of the word is probably to keep the eggs together (Targum,
[Jer 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011.md), בּעין מכנּשׁ, lxx
συνήγαγεν), since דּגר (syn. חמּר) signifies "to collect." Rashi has
therefore explained it in both passages as meaning glousser, to cluck,
the noise by which a fowl calls its brood together. The dayyâh is the
vulture. These fowls and most gregarious birds of prey also collect
together there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 34:16</span></span>

Whenever any one compared the prophecy with the fulfilment, they would
be found to coincide. "Search in the book of Jehovah, and read! Not one
of the creatures fails, not one misses the other: for my mouth - it has
commanded it; and His breath - it has brought them together. And He has
cast the lot for them, and His hand has assigned it (this land) to them
by measure: they will possess it for ever; to generation and generation
they will dwell therein." The phrase על כּתב is used for entering in a
book, inasmuch as what is written there is placed upon the page; and מעל
דּרשׁ for searching in a book, inasmuch as a person leans over the book
when searching in it, and gets the object of his search out of it. The
prophet applied the title "The Book of Jehovah" to his collection of the
prophecies with which Jehovah had inspired him, and which He had
commanded him to write down. Whoever lived to see the time when the
judgment should come upon Edom, would have only to look inquiringly into
this holy scripture; and if he compared what was predicted there with
what had been actually realized, he would find the most exact agreement
between them. The creatures named, which loved to frequent the marshes
and solitary places, and ruins, would all really make their homes in
what had once been Edom. But the satyrs and the lı̄lı̄th, which were only
the offspring of the popular belief - what of them? They, too, would be
there; for in the sense intended by the prophet they were actual devils,
which he merely calls by well-known popular names to produce a spectral
impression. Edom would really become a rendezvous for all the animals
mentioned, as well as for such unearthly spirits as those which he
refers to here. The prophet, or rather Jehovah, whose temporary organ he
was, still further confirms this by saying, "My mouth hath commanded it,
and His breath has brought them (all these creatures) together." As the
first creating word proceeded from the mouth of Jehovah, so also does
the word of prophecy, which resembles such a word; and the breath of the
mouth of Jehovah, i.e., His Spirit, is the power which accomplishes the
fiat of prophecy, as it did that of creation, and moulds all creatures
and their history according to the will and counsel of God ([Psa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006).md). In the second part of [Isa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016.md) the prophet is speaking of
Jehovah; whereas in the first Jehovah speaks through him - a variation
which vanishes indeed if we read פּיו (Olshausen on [Job
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002).md), or, what would be better,
פּיהוּ, but which may be sustained by a hundred cases of a similar kind.
There is a shadow, as it were, of this change in the להם, which
alternates with להן in connection with the animals named. The suffix of
chilleqattâh (without mappik, as in [Sa1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#006).md) refers to the land of Edom. Edom
is, as it were, given up by a divine lot, and measured off with a divine
measure, to be for ever the horrible abode of beasts and demons such as
those described. A prelude of the fulfilment of this swept over the
mountainous land of Edom immediately after the destruction of Jerusalem
(see Khler on [Mal 1:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002).md); and it has
never risen to its previous state of cultivation again. It swarms with
snakes, and the desolate mountain heights and barren table-lands are
only inhabited by wild crows and eagles, and great flocks of birds. But
the ultimate fulfilment, to which the appeal in [Isa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016.md) refers, is still in the future,
and will eventually fall upon the abodes of those who spiritually belong
to that circle of hostility to Jehovah (Jesus) and His church, of which
ancient Edom was merely the centre fixed by the prophet.
