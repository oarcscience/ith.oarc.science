### [Nehemiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

I. Nehemiah's Journey to Jerusalem, and the Restoration of the Walls of
Jerusalem - [Neh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

Nehemiah, cup-bearer to King Artaxerxes, is plunged into deep affliction
by the account which he receives from certain individuals from Judah of
the sad condition of his countrymen who had returned to Jerusalem and
Judah. He prays with fasting to the Lord for mercy ([Neh
1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001).md), and on a favourable
opportunity entreats the king and queen for permission to make a journey
to Jerusalem, and for the necessary authority to repair its ruined
walls. His request being granted, he travels as governor to Jerusalem,
provided with letters from the king, and escorted by captains of the
army and horsemen ([Neh 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001).md). Soon
after his arrival, he surveys the condition of the walls and gates,
summons the rulers of the people and the priests to set about building
the wall, and in spite of the obstacles he encounters from the enemies
of the Jews, accomplishes this work (2:11-6:19). In describing the
manner in which the building of the walls was carried on, he first
enumerates in succession (3) the individuals and companies engaged in
restoring the walls surrounding the city (3), and then relates the
obstacles and difficulties encountered (4:1-6:19).

[Nehemiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 1:1</span></span>

In the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, Nehemiah, being then
at Susa, received from one of his brethren, and other individuals from
Judah, information which deeply grieved him, concerning the sad
condition of the captive who had returned to the land of their fathers,
and the state of Jerusalem. [Neh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)
contains the title of the whole book: the History of Nehemiah. By the
addition "son of Hachaliah," Nehemiah is distinguished from others of
the same name (e.g., from Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, [Neh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#016).md). Another Nehemiah, too, returned
from captivity with Zerubbabel, [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md). Of Hachaliah we know nothing
further, his name occurring but once more, [Neh
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002.md), in conjunction, as here, with
that of Nehemiah. Eusebius and Jerome assert that Nehemiah was of the
tribe of Judah, - a statement which may be correct, but is unsupported
by any evidence from the Old Testament. According to [Neh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011.md), he was cup-bearer to the Persian
king, and was, at his own request, appointed for some time Pecha, i.e.,
governor, of Judah. Comp. [Neh 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014.md);
[Neh 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026.md), and [Neh
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009.md); [Neh
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002.md). "In the month Chisleu of the
twentieth year I was in the citadel of Susa" - such is the manner in
which Nehemiah commences the narrative of his labours for Jerusalem.
Chisleu is the ninth month of the year, answering to our December. Comp.
[Zac 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md), 1 Macc. 4:52. The twentieth
year is, according to [Neh 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001.md), the
twentieth year of Artaxerxes Longimanus. On the citadel of Susa, see
further details in the remarks on [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md). Susa was the capital of the
province Susiana, and its citadel, called by the Greeks Memnoneion, was
strongly fortified. The kings of Persia were accustomed to reside here
during some months of the year.

[Neh 1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002.md)

There came to Nehemiah Hanani, one of his brethren, and certain men from
Judah. מאחי אחד, one of my brethren, might mean merely a relation of
Nehemiah, אחים being often used of more distant relations; but since
Nehemiah calls Hanani אחי in [Neh
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#010.md), it is evident that his own
brother is meant. "And I asked them concerning the Jews, and concerning
Jerusalem." היּהוּדים is further defined by וגו הפּליטה, who had
escaped, who were left from the captivity; those who had returned to
Judah are intended, as contrasted with those who still remained in
heathen, lands. In the answer, [Neh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md), they are more precisely
designated as being "there in the province (of Judah)." With respect to
המּדינה, see remarks on [Ezr 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md). They
are said to be "in great affliction (רעה) and in reproach." Their
affliction is more nearly defined by the accessory clause which follows:
and the wall = because the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its
gates burned with fire. מפרצת, Pual (the intensive form), broken down,
does not necessarily mean that the whole wall was destroyed, but only
portions, as appears from the subsequent description of the building of
the wall, Neh 3.

[Neh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md)

This description of the state of the returned captives plunged Nehemiah
into such deep affliction, that he passed some days in mourning,
fasting, and prayer. Opinions are divided with respect to the historical
relation of the facts mentioned [Neh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md). Some older expositors thought
that Hanani could not have spoken of the destruction of the walls and
gates of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, because this was already
sufficiently known to Nehemiah, but of some recent demolition on the
part of Samaritans and other hostile neighbours of the Jews; in
opposition to which, Rambach simply replies that we are told nothing of
a restoration of the wall of Jerusalem by Zerubbabel and Ezra. More
recently Ewald (Geschichte, iv. p. 137f.) has endeavoured to show, from
certain psalms which he transposes to post-Babylonian times, the
probability of a destruction of the rebuilt wall, but gives a decided
negative to the question, whether this took place during the thirteen
years between the arrivals of Ezra and Nehemiah. "For," says he, "there
is not in the whole of Nehemiah's record the most distant hint that the
walls had been destroyed only a short time since; but, on the contrary,
this destruction was already so remote an event, that its occasion and
authors were no longer spoken of." Vaihinger (Theol. Stud. und Krit.,
1857, p. 88, comp. 1854, p. 124f.) and Bertheau are of opinion that it
indisputably follows from [Neh 1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md),
as appearances show, that the walls of Jerusalem were actually rebuilt
and the gates set up before the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, and that
the destruction of this laborious work, which occasioned the sending of
an embassy to the Persian court, was of quite recent occurrence, since
otherwise Nehemiah would not have been so painfully affected by it. But
even the very opposite opinion held concerning the impression made upon
the reader by these verses, shows that appearances are deceitful, and
the view that the destruction of the walls and gates was of quite recent
occurrence is not implied by the words themselves, but only inserted in
them by expositors. There is no kind of historical evidence that the
walls of Jerusalem which had been destroyed by the Chaldeans were once
more rebuilt before Nehemiah's arrival.

The documents given by [Ezr 4:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#008.md),
which are in this instance appealed to, so far from proving the fact,
rather bear testimony against it. The counsellor Rehum and the scribe
Shimshai, in their letter to Artaxerxes, accuse indeed the Jews of
building a rebellious and bad city, of restoring its walls and digging
its foundations ([Ezr 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012).md); but they
only give the king to understand that if this city be built and its
walls restored, the king will no longer have a portion on this side the
river ([Ezr 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#016).md), and hasten to
Jerusalem, as soon as they receive the king's decision, to hinder the
Jews by force and power ([Ezr 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#023).md).
Now, even if this accusation were quite well founded, nothing further
can be inferred from it than that the Jews had begun to restore the
walls, but were hindered in the midst of their undertaking. Nothing is
said in these documents either of a rebuilding, i.e., a complete
restoration, of the walls and setting up of the gates, or of breaking
down the walls and burning the gates. It cannot be said that to build a
wall means the same as pulling down a wall already built. Nor is
anything said in [Neh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md) and [Neh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md) of a recent demolition. The
assertion, too, that the destruction of this laborious work was the
occasion of the mission of Hanani and certain men of Judah to the
Persian court (Vaihinger), is entirely without scriptural support. In
[Neh 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002.md) and [Neh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md) it is merely said that Hanani and
his companions came from Judah to Nehemiah, and that Nehemiah questioned
them concerning the condition of the Jews in the province of Judah, and
concerning Jerusalem, and that they answered: The Jews there are in
great affliction and reproach, for the wall of Jerusalem is broken down
(מפרצת is a participle expressing the state, not the praeter. or
perfect, which would be found here if a destruction recently effected
were spoken of). Nehemiah, too, in [Neh
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003.md) and [Neh
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#017.md), only says: The city of my
fathers' sepulchres (Jerusalem) lieth desolate (חרבה is an adjective),
not: has been desolated. Nor can a visit on the part of Jews from Judah
to their compatriot and relative, the king's cup-bearer, be called a
mission to the Persian court. - With respect also to the deep affliction
of Nehemiah, upon which Bertheau lays so much stress, it by no means
proves that he had received a terrible account of some fresh calamity
which had but just befallen the community at Jerusalem, and whose whole
extent was as yet unknown to him. Nehemiah had not as yet been to
Jerusalem, and could not from his own experience know the state of
affairs in Judah and Jerusalem; hence he questioned the newly arrived
visitors, not concerning the latest occurrences, but as to the general
condition of the returned captives. The fact of the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Chaldees could not, of course, be unknown to him; but
neither could he be ignorant that now ninety years since a great number
of captives had returned to their homes with Zerubbabel and settled in
Judah and Jerusalem, and that seventy years since the temple at
Jerusalem had been rebuilt. Judging from these facts, he might not have
imagined that the state of affairs in Judah and Jerusalem was so bad as
it really was. When, then, he now learnt that those who had returned to
Judah were in great affliction, that the walls of the town were still
lying in ruins and its gates burned, and that it was therefore exposed
defenceless to all the insults of hostile neighbours, even this
information might well grieve him. It is also probable that it was
through Hanani and his companions that he first learnt of the inimical
epistle of the royal officials Rehum and Shimshai to Artaxerxes, and of
the answer sent thereto by that monarch and thus became for the first
time aware of the magnitude of his fellow-countrymen's difficulties.
Such intelligence might well be such a shock to him as to cause the
amount of distress described [Neh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md).
For even if he indulged the hope that the king might repeal the decree
by which the rebuilding of the wall had been prohibited till further
orders, he could not but perceive how difficult it would be effectually
to remedy the grievous state in which his countrymen who had returned to
the land of their fathers found themselves, while the disposition of
their neighbours towards them was thus hostile. This state was indeed
sufficiently distressing to cause deep pain to one who had a heart alive
to the welfare of his nation, and there is no need for inventing new
"calamities," of which history knows nothing, to account for the sorrow
of Nehemiah. Finally, the circumstance that the destruction of the walls
and burning of the gates are alone mentioned as proofs of the affliction
and reproach which the returned exiles were suffering, arises simply
from an intention to hint at the remedy about to be described in the
narrative which follows, by bringing this special kind of reproach
prominently forward.

[Nehemiah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 1:5</span></span>

Nehemiah's prayer, as given in these verses, comprises the prayers which
he prayed day and night, during the period of his mourning and fasting
([Neh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md) comp. [Neh
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#006).md), to his faithful and covenant
God, to obtain mercy for his people, and the divine blessing upon his
project for their assistance.

[Neh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#005.md)

The invocation of Jahve as: Thou God of heaven, alludes to God's
almighty government of the world, and the further predicates of God, to
His covenant faithfulness. "Thou great and terrible God" recalls [Deu
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021.md), and "who keepest covenant and
mercy," etc., [Deu 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009.md) and [Exo
20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md).

[Neh 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#006.md)

"Let Thine ear be attentive, and Thine eyes open," like [Ch2
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#040.md); [Ch2
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#015.md) - לשׁמע, that Thou mayest hearken
to the prayer of Thy servant, which I pray, and how I confess concerning
... מתדּה still depends upon אשׁר in the sense of: and what I confess
concerning the sins. היּום does not here mean to-day, but now, at this
time, as the addition "day and night" compared with ימים in [Neh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md) shows. To strengthen the
communicative form לך חטאנוּ, and to acknowledge before God how deeply
penetrated he was by the feeling of his own sin and guilt, he adds: and
I and my father's house have sinned.

[Neh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#007.md)

We have dealt very corruptly against Thee. חבל is the inf. constr.
instead of the infin. abs., which, before the finite verb, and by reason
of its close connection therewith, becomes the infin. constr., like אהיה
היות, [Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021.md); comp. Ewald, 240, c.
The dealing corruptly against God consists in not having kept the
commandments, statutes, and judgments of the law.

[Neh 1:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#008.md)

With his confession of grievous transgression, Nehemiah combines the
petition that the Lord would be mindful of His word declared by Moses,
that if His people, whom He had scattered among the heathen for their
sins, should turn to Him and keep His commandments, He would gather them
from all places where He had scattered them, and bring them back to the
place which He had chosen to place His name there. This word (הדּבר) he
designates, as that which God had commanded to His servant Moses,
inasmuch as it formed a part of that covenant law which was prescribed
to the Israelites as their rule of life. The matter of this word is
introduced by לאמר: ye transgress, I will scatter; i.e., if ye
transgress by revolting from me, I will scatter you among the nations, -
and ye turn to me and keep my commandments (i.e., if ye turn to me and
... ), if there were of you cast out to the end of heaven (i.e., to the
most distant regions where the end of heaven touches the earth), thence
will I gather you, etc. נדּח, pat. Niphal, with a collective meaning,
cast-out ones, like [Deu 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#004.md). These
words are no verbal quotation, but a free summary, in which Nehemiah had
[Deu 30:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md) chiefly in view, of what
God had proclaimed in the law of Moses concerning the dispersion of His
people among the heathen if they sinned against Him, and of their return
to the land of their fathers if they repented and turned to Him. The
clause: if the cast-out ones were at the end of heaven, etc., stands
verbally in [Neh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md). The last words,
[Neh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#009), "(I will bring them.md) to the
place which I have chosen, that my name may dwell there," are a special
application of the general promise of the law to the present case.
Jerusalem is meant, where the Lord caused His name to dwell in the
temple; comp. [Deu 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md). The entreaty
to remember this word and to fulfil it, seems ill adapted to existing
circumstances, for a portion of the people were already brought back to
Jerusalem; and Nehemiah's immediate purpose was to pray, not for the
return of those still sojourning among the heathen, but for the removal
of the affliction and reproach resting on those who were now at
Jerusalem. Still less appropriate seems the citation of the words: If ye
transgress, I will scatter you among the nations. It must, however, be
remembered that Nehemiah is not so much invoking the divine compassion
as the righteousness and faithfulness of a covenant God, the great and
terrible God that keepeth covenant and mercy ([Neh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#005).md). Now this, God had shown Himself
to be, by fulfilling the threats of His law that He would scatter His
faithless and transgressing people among the nations. Thus His
fulfilment of this one side of the covenant strengthened the hope that
God would also keep His other covenant word to His people who turned to
Him, viz., that He would bring them again to the land of their fathers,
to the place of His gracious presence. Hence the reference to the
dispersion of the nation among the heathen, forms the actual
substructure for the request that so much of the promise as yet remained
unfulfilled might come to pass. Nehemiah, moreover, views this promise
in the full depth of its import, as securing to Israel not merely an
external return to their native land, but their restoration as a
community, in the midst of whom the Lord had His dwelling, and
manifested Himself as the defence and refuge of His people. To the
re-establishment of this covenant relation very much was still wanting.
Those who had returned from captivity had indeed settled in the land of
their fathers; and the temple in which they might worship God with
sacrifices, according to the law, was rebuilt at Jerusalem. But
notwithstanding all this, Jerusalem, with its ruined walls and burned
gates, was still like a city lying waste, and exposed to attacks of all
kinds; while the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah were
loaded with shame and contempt by their heathen neighbours. In this
sense, Jerusalem was not yet restored, and the community dwelling
therein not yet brought to the place where the name of the Lord dwelt.
In this respect, the promise that Jahve would again manifest Himself to
His repentant people as the God of the covenant was still unfulfilled,
and the petition that He would gather His people to the place which He
had chosen to put His name there, i.e., to manifest Himself according to
His nature, as testified in His covenant ([Exo
34:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006).md), quite justifiable. In [Neh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#010.md) Nehemiah supports his petition by
the words: And these (now dwelling in Judah and Jerusalem) are Thy
servants and Thy people whom Thou hast redeemed, etc. His servants who
worship Him in His temple, His people whom He has redeemed from Egypt by
His great power and by His strong arm, God cannot leave in affliction
and reproach. The words: "redeemed with great power" ... are
reminiscences from [Deu 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008.md); [Deu
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#026.md), [Deu
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#029.md), and other passages in the
Pentateuch, and refer to the deliverance from Egypt.

[Neh 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011.md)

The prayer closes with the reiterated entreaty that God would hearken to
the prayer of His servant (i.e., Nehemiah), and to the prayer of His
servants who delight to fear His name (יראה, infin. like [Deu
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010) and elsewhere.md), i.e., of all
Israelites who, like Nehemiah, prayed to God to redeem Israel from all
his troubles. For himself in particular, Nehemiah also request: "Prosper
Thy servant to-day (היּום like [Neh
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#006.md); לעבדּך may be either the
accusative of the person, like [Ch2
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005.md), or the dative: Prosper his
design unto Thy servant, like [Neh
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#020).md), and give him to mercy (i.e.,
cause him to find mercy; comp. [Kg1
8:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#050.md); [Psa
106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046).md) before the face of this man."
What man he means is explained by the following supplementary remark,
"And I was cup-bearer to the king," without whose favour and permission
Nehemiah could not have carried his project into execution (as related
in Neh 2).
