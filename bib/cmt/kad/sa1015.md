War with Amalek. Saul's Disobedience and Rejection - 1 Samuel 15

As Saul had transgressed the commandment of God which was given to him
through Samuel, by the sacrifice which he offered at Gilgal in the war
with the Philistines at the very commencement of his reign, and had
thereby drawn upon himself the threat that his monarchy should not be
continued in perpetuity ([Sa1
13:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#013).md); so his disobedience in the
war against the Amalekites was followed by his rejection on the part of
God. The Amalekites were the first heathen nation to attack the
Israelites after their deliverance out of Egypt, which they did in the
most treacherous manner on their journey from Egypt to Sinai; and they
had been threatened by God with extermination in consequence. This Moses
enjoined upon Joshua, and also committed to writing, for the Israelites
to observe in all future generations ([Exo
17:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008).md). As the Amalekites afterwards
manifested the same hostility to the people of God which they had
displayed in this first attack, on every occasion which appeared
favourable to their ravages, the Lord instructed Samuel to issue the
command to Saul, to wage war against Amalek, and to smite man and beast
with the ban, i.e., to put all to death ([Sa1
15:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001).md). But when Saul had smitten
them, he not only left Agag the king alive, but spared the best of the
cattle that he had taken as booty, and merely executed the ban upon such
animals as were worthless ([Sa1
15:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004).md). He was rejected by the Lord
for this disobedience, so that he was to be no longer king over Israel.
His rejection was announced to him by Samuel ([Sa1
15:10-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#010).md), and was not retracted in
spite of his prayer for the forgiveness of his sin ([Sa1
15:24-35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024).md). In fact, Saul had no excuse
for this breach of the divine command; it was nothing but open rebellion
against the sovereignty of God in Israel; and if Jehovah would continue
King of Israel, He must punish it by the rejection of the rebel. For
Saul no longer desired to be the medium of the sovereignty of Jehovah,
or the executor of the commands of the God-king, but simply wanted to
reign according to his own arbitrary will. Nevertheless this rejection
was not followed by his outward deposition. The Lord merely took away
His Spirit, had David anointed king by Samuel, and thenceforward so
directed the steps of Saul and David, that as time advanced the hearts
of the people were turned away more and more from Saul to David; and on
the death of Saul, the attempt of the ambitious Abner to raise his son
Ishbosheth to the throne could not possibly have any lasting success.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 15:1</span></span>

The account of the war against the Amalekites is a very condensed one,
and is restricted to a description of the conduct of Saul on that
occasion. Without mentioning either the time or the immediate occasion
of the war, the narrative commences with the command of God which Samuel
solemnly communicated to Saul, to go and exterminate that people. Samuel
commenced with the words, "Jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king
over His people, over Israel," in order to show to Saul the obligation
which rested upon him to receive his commission as coming from God, and
to proceed at once to fulfil it. The allusion to the anointing points
back not to [Sa1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015.md), but to [Sa1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001.md).

[Sa1 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#002.md)

"Thus saith the Lord of Zebaoth, I have looked upon what Amalek did to
Israel, that it placed itself in his way when he came up out of Egypt"
([Exo 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008).md). Samuel merely mentions
this first outbreak of hostility on the part of Amalek towards the
people of Israel, because in this the same disposition was already
manifested which now made the people ripe for the judgment of
extermination (vid., [Exo 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014).md). The
hostility which they had now displayed, according to [Sa1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033.md), there was no necessity for the
prophet to mention particularly, since it was well known to Saul and all
Israel. When God looks upon a sin, directs His glance towards it, He
must punish it according to His own holiness. This פּקדתּי points at the
very outset to the punishment about to be proclaimed.

[Sa1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003.md)

Saul is to smite and ban everything belonging to it without reserve,
i.e., to put to death both man and beast. The last clause וגו is only an
explanation and exemplification of וגו והחרמתּם. "From man to woman,"
etc., i.e., men and women, children and sucklings, etc.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 15:4</span></span>

Saul summoned the people to war, and mustered them (those who were
summoned) at Telaim (this was probably the same place as the Telem
mentioned in [Jos 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024.md), and is to be
looked for in the eastern portion of the Negeb). "Two hundred thousand
foot, and ten thousand of the men of Judah:" this implies that the two
hundred thousand were from the other tribes. These numbers are not too
large; for a powerful Bedouin nation, such as the Amalekites were, could
not possibly be successfully attacked with a small army, but only by
raising the whole of the military force of Israel.

[Sa1 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#005.md)

He then advanced as far as the city of the Amalekites, the situation of
which is altogether unknown, and placed an ambush in the valley. ויּרב
does not come from ריב, to fight, i.e., to quarrel, not to give battle,
but was understood even by the early translators as a contracted form of
ויּארב, the Hiphil of ארב. And modern commentators have generally
understood it in the same way; but Olshausen (Hebr. Gramm. p. 572)
questions the correctness of the reading, and Thenius proposes to alter
בּנּחל ויּרב into מלחמה ויּערך. נחל refers to a valley in the
neighbourhood of the city of the Amalekites.

[Sa1 15:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md)

Saul directed the Kenites to come out from among the Amalekites, that
they might not perish with them (אספך, imp. Kal of אסף), as they had
shown affection to the Israelites on their journey out of Egypt (compare
[Num 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md) with [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016).md). He then smote the Amalekites
from Havilah in the direction towards Shur, which lay before (to the
east of) Egypt (cf. [Gen 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#018).md). Shur
is the desert of Jifar, i.e., that portion of the desert of Arabia which
borders upon Egypt (see at [Gen 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007).md).
Havilah, the country of the Chaulotaeans, on the border of Arabia
Petraea towards Yemen (see at [Gen
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#029).md).

[Sa1 15:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#008.md)

Their king, Agag, he took alive (on the name, see at [Num
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007).md), but all the people he banned
with the edge of the sword, i.e., he had them put to death without
quarter. "All," i.e., all that fell into the hands of the Israelites.
For it follows from the very nature of the case that many escaped, and
consequently there is nothing striking in the fact that Amalekites are
mentioned again at a later period ([Sa1
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md); [Sa1
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001.md); [Sa2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012).md). The last remnant was destroyed
by the Simeonites upon the mountains of Seir in the reign of Hezekiah
([Ch1 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#043).md). Only, king Agag did Saul
and the people (of Israel) spare, also "the best of the sheep and oxen,
and the animals of the second birth, and the lambs and everything good;
these they would not ban." משׁנים, according to D. Kimchi and R. Tanch.
, are לבטן שׁניים, i.e., animalia secundo partu edita, which were
considered superior to the others (vid., Roediger in Ges. Thes. p.
1451); and כּרים, pasture lambs, i.e., fat lambs. There is no necessity,
therefore, for the conjecture of Ewald and Thenius, משׁמנּים, fattened,
and כּרמים, vineyards; nor for the far-fetched explanation given by
Bochart, viz., camels with two humps and camel-saddles, to say nothing
of the fact that camel-saddles and vineyards are altogether out of place
here. In "all that was good" the things already mentioned singly are all
included. המּלאכה, the property; here it is applied to cattle, as in
[Gen 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#014.md). נמבזה = נבזה, despised,
undervalued. The form of the word is not contracted from a noun מבזה and
the participle נבזה (Ges. Lehrgeb. p. 463), but seems to be a participle
Niph. formed from a noun מבזה. But as such a form is contrary to all
analogy, Ewald and Olshausen regard the reading as corrupt. נמס (from
מסס): flowing away; used with reference to diseased cattle, or such as
have perished. The reason for sparing the best cattle is very apparent,
namely selfishness. But it is not so easy to determine why Agag should
have been spared by Saul. It is by no means probable that he wished
thereby to do honour to the royal dignity. O. v. Gerlach's supposition,
that vanity or the desire to make a display with a royal slave was the
actual reason, is a much more probable one.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 15:10</span></span>

The word of the Lord came to Samuel: "It repenteth me that I have made
Saul king, for he hath turned away from me, and not set up (carried out)
my word." (On the repentance of God, see the remarks on [Gen
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006)..md) That this does not express any
changeableness in the divine nature, but simply the sorrow of the divine
love at the rebellion of sinners, is evident enough from [Sa1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029.md). יי מאחרי שׁוּב, to turn round
from following God, in order to go his own ways. This was Saul's real
sin. He would no longer be the follower and servant of the Lord, but
would be absolute ruler in Israel. Pride arising from the consciousness
of his own strength, led him astray to break the command of God. What
more God said to Samuel is not communicated here, because it could
easily be gathered and supplied from what Samuel himself proceeded to do
(see more particularly [Sa1 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#016)..md).
In order to avoid repetitions, only the principal feature in the divine
revelation is mentioned here, and the details are given fully afterwards
in the account of the fulfilment of the instructions. Samuel was deeply
agitated by this word of the Lord. "It burned (in) him," sc., wrath (אף,
compare [Gen 31:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#036.md) with [Gen
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#002).md), not on account of the
repentance to which God had given utterance at having raised up Saul as
king, nor merely at Saul's disobedience, but at the frustration of the
purpose of God in calling him to be king in consequence of his
disobedience, from which he might justly dread the worst results in
relation to the glory of Jehovah and his own prophetic labours.

(Note: "Many grave thoughts seem to have presented themselves at once to
Samuel and disturbed his mind, when he reflected upon the dishonour
which might be heaped upon the name of God, and the occasion which the
rejection and deposition of Saul would furnish to wicked men for
blaspheming God. For Saul had been anointed by the ministry of Samuel,
and he had been chosen by God himself from all the people, and called by
Him to the throne. If, therefore, he was nevertheless deposed, it seemed
likely that so much would be detracted from the authority of Samuel and
the confidence of the people in his teaching, and, moreover, that the
worship of God would be overturned, and the greatest disturbance ensue;
in fact, that universal confusion would burst upon the nation. These
were probably the grounds upon which Samuel's great indignation rested."
- Calvin.)

The opinion that ל יחר is also used to signify deep distress cannot be
established from [Sa2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#008.md). "And he
cried to Jehovah the whole night," sc., praying for Saul to be forgiven.
But it was in vain. This is evident from what follows, where Samuel
maintains the cause of his God with strength and decision, after having
wrestled with God in prayer.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 15:12</span></span>

The next morning, after receiving the revelation from God ([Sa1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011).md), Samuel rose up early, to go
and meet Saul as he was returning from the war. On the way it was told
him, "Saul has come to Carmel" - i.e., Kurmul, upon the mountains of
Judah to the south-east of Hebron (see at [Jos
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055).md) - "setting himself a memorial"
(יד, a hand, then a memorial or monument, inasmuch as the hand calls
attention to anything: see [Sa2
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018).md), "and has turned and proceeded
farther, and gone down to Gilgal" (in the valley of the Jordan, as in
[Sa1 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#004).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 15:13</span></span>

When Samuel met him there, Saul attempted to hide his consciousness of
guilt by a feigned friendly welcome. "Blessed be thou of the Lord"
(vid., [Rut 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#020.md); [Gen
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#019), etc..md) was his greeting to the
prophet; "I have set up the word of Jehovah."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 15:14</span></span>

But the prophet stripped his hypocrisy at once with the question, "What
then is this bleating of sheep in my ears, and a lowing of oxen that I
hear?" Saul replied ([Sa1 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#015).md),
"They have brought them from the Amalekites, because the people spared
the best sheep and oxen, to sacrifice them to the Lord thy God; and the
rest we have banned." So that it was not Saul, but the people, who had
transgressed the command of the Lord, and that with the most laudable
intention, viz., to offer the best of the cattle that had been taken, as
a thank-offering to the Lord. The falsehood and hypocrisy of these words
lay upon the very surface; for even if the cattle spared were really
intended as sacrifices to the Lord, not only the people, but Saul also,
would have had their own interests in view (vid., [Sa1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#009).md), since the flesh of
thank-offerings was appropriated to sacrificial meals.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 15:16</span></span>

Samuel therefore bade him be silent. הרף, "leave off," excusing thyself
any further. "I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night."
(The Chethibh ויּאמרוּ is evidently a copyist's error for ויּאמר.) "Is
it not true, when thou wast little in thine eyes (a reference to Saul's
own words, [Sa1 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#021).md), thou didst
become head of the tribes of Israel? and Jehovah anointed thee king over
Israel, and Jehovah sent thee on the way, and said, Go and ban the
sinners, the Amalekites, and make war against them, until thou
exterminatest them. And wherefore hast thou nor hearkened to the voice
of Jehovah, and hast fallen upon the booty," etc.? (תּעט, see at [Sa1
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#032)..md)

Even after this Saul wanted to justify himself, and to throw the blame
of sparing the cattle upon the people.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 15:20</span></span>

"Yea, I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah (אשׁר serving, like כּי
ekil , to introduce the reply: here it is used in the sense of
asseveration, utique, yea), and have brought Agag the king of the
Amalekites, and banned Amalek." Bringing Agag he mentioned probably as a
practical proof that he had carried out the war of extermination against
the Amalekites.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 15:21</span></span>

Even the sparing of the cattle he endeavoured to defend as the
fulfilment of a religious duty. The people had taken sheep and oxen from
the booty, "as firstlings of the ban," to sacrifice to Jehovah.
Sacrificing the best of the booty taken in war as an offering of
first-fruits to the Lord, was not indeed prescribed in the law, but was
a praiseworthy sign of piety, by which all honour was rendered to the
Lord as the giver of the victory (see [Num
31:48](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#048)..md). This, Saul meant to say, was
what the people had done on the present occasion; only he overlooked the
fact, that what was banned to the Lord could not be offered to Him as a
burnt-offering, because, being most holy, it belonged to Him already
([Lev 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029).md), and according to [Deu
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#016.md), was to be put to death, as
Samuel had expressly said to Saul ([Sa1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 15:22</span></span>

Without entering, therefore, into any discussion of the meaning of the
ban, as Saul only wanted to cover over his own wrong-doings by giving
this turn to the affair, Samuel put a stop to any further excuses, by
saying, "Hath Jehovah delight in burnt-offerings and slain-offerings as
in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? (i.e., in obedience to His word.)
Behold, hearing (obeying) is better than slain-offerings, attending
better than fat of rams." By saying this, Samuel did not reject
sacrifices as worthless; he did not say that God took no pleasure in
burnt-offerings and slain-offerings, but simply compared sacrifice with
obedience to the command of God, and pronounced the latter of greater
worth than the former. "It was as much as to say that the sum and
substance of divine worship consisted in obedience, with which it should
always begin, and that sacrifices were, so to speak, simple appendices,
the force and worth of which were not so great as of obedience to the
precepts of God" (Calvin). But it necessarily follows that sacrifices
without obedience to the commandments of God are utterly worthless; in
fact, are displeasing to God, as [Psa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008.md)., [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md)., [Isa
66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md), [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020.md), and all the prophets, distinctly
affirm. There was no necessity, however, to carry out this truth any
further. To tear off the cloak of hypocrisy, with which Saul hoped to
cover his disobedience, it was quite enough to affirm that God's first
demand was obedience, and that observing His word was better than
sacrifice; because, as the Berleb. Bible puts it, "in sacrifices a man
offers only the strange flesh of irrational animals, whereas in
obedience he offers his own will, which is rational or spiritual
worship" ([Rom 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008).md). This spiritual
worship was shadowed forth in the sacrificial worship of the Old
Testament. In the sacrificial animal the Israelite was to give up and
sanctify his own person and life to the Lord. (For an examination of the
meaning of the different sacrifices, see Pent. pp. 505ff., and Keil's
Bibl Archol. 41ff.) But if this were the design of the sacrifices, it
was clear enough that God did not desire the animal sacrifice in itself,
but first and chiefly obedience to His own word. In [Sa1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md), טּוב is not to be connected as
an adjective with זבח, "more than good sacrifice," as the Sept. and
Thenius render it; it is rather to be taken as a predicate, "better than
slain-offerings," and מזּבח is placed first simply for the sake of
emphasis. Any contrast between good and bad sacrifices, such as the
former construction would introduce into the words, is not only foreign
to the context, but also opposed to the parallelism. For אילים חלב does
not mean fat rams, but the fat of rams; the fat portions taken from the
ram, which were placed upon the altar in the case of the
slain-offerings, and for which חלב is the technical expression (compare
[Lev 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#009.md), [Lev
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#016.md), with [Lev
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#004.md), [Lev
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#011), etc..md). "For," continued Samuel
([Sa1 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023).md), "rebellion is the sin of
soothsaying, and opposition is heathenism and idolatry." מרי and הפצר
are the subjects, and synonymous in their meaning. קסם חטּאת, the sin of
soothsaying, i.e., of divination in connection with the worship of
idolatrous and demoniacal powers. In the second clause idols are
mentioned instead of idolatry, and compared to resistance, but without
any particle of comparison. Opposition is keeping idols and teraphim,
i.e., it is like worshipping idols and teraphim. און, nothingness, then
an idol or image (vid., [Isa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md);
[Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md), [Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008).md). On the teraphim as domestic and
oracular deities, see at [Gen 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md).
Opposition to God is compared by Samuel to soothsaying and oracles,
because idolatry was manifested in both of them. All conscious
disobedience is actually idolatry, because it makes self-will, the human
I, into a god. So that all manifest opposition to the word and
commandment of God is, like idolatry, a rejection of the true God.
"Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, He hath rejected thee,
that thou mayst be no longer king." ממּלך = מלך מהיוה ([Sa1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#026).md), away from being king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 15:24</span></span>

This sentence made so powerful an impression upon Saul, that he
confessed, "I have sinned: for I have transgressed the command of the
Lord and thy words, because I feared the people, and hearkened to their
voice." But these last words, with which he endeavoured to make his sin
appear as small as possible, show that the consciousness of his guilt
did not go very deep. Even if the people had really desired that the
best of the cattle should be spared, he ought not as king to have given
his consent to their wish, since God had commanded that they should all
be banned (i.e., destroyed); and even though he has yielded from
weakness, this weakness could not lessen his guilt before God. This
repentance, therefore, was rather the effect of alarm at the rejection
which had been announced to him, than the fruit of any genuine
consciousness of sin. "It was not true and serious repentance, or the
result of genuine sorrow of heart because he had offended God, but was
merely repentance of the lips arising from fear of losing the kingdom,
and of incurring public disgrace" (C. v. Lapide). This is apparent even
from [Sa1 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#025.md), but still more from
[Sa1 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#030.md). In [Sa1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#025.md) he not only entreats Samuel for
the forgiveness of his sin, but says, "Return with me, that I may pray
to the Lord." The שׁוּב presupposes that Samuel was about to go away
after the executing his commission. Saul entreated him to remain that he
might pray, i.e., not only in order to obtain for him the forgiveness of
his sin through his intercession, but, according to [Sa1
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#030.md), to show him honour before the
elders of the people and before Israel, that his rejection might not be
known.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#026.md)

This request Samuel refused, repeating at the same time the sentence of
rejection, and turned to depart. "Then Saul laid hold of the lappet of
his mantle (i.e., his upper garment), and it tore" (lit. was torn off).
That the Niphal ויּקּרע is correct, and is not to be altered into אתהּ
ויּקרע, "Saul tore off the lappet," according to the rendering of the
lxx, as Thenius supposes, is evident from the explanation which Samuel
gave of the occurrence ([Sa1 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#028).md):
"Jehovah hath torn the sovereignty of Israel from thee to-day, and given
it to thy neighbour, who is better than thou." As Saul was about to hold
back the prophet by force, that he might obtain from him a revocation of
the divine sentence, the tearing of the mantle, which took place
accidentally, and evidently without any such intention on the part of
Saul, was to serve as a sign of the rending away of the sovereignty from
him. Samuel did not yet know to whom Jehovah would give it; he therefore
used the expression לרעך, as רע is applied to any one with whom a person
associates. To confirm his own words, he adds in [Sa1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029.md) : "And also the Trust of Israel
doth not lie and doth not repent, for He is not a man to repent." נצח
signifies constancy, endurance, then confidence, trust, because a man
can trust in what is constant. This meaning is to be retained here,
where the word is used as a name for God, and not the meaning gloria,
which is taken in [Ch1 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#011.md) from the
Aramaean usage of speech, and would be altogether unsuitable here, where
the context suggests the idea of unchangeableness. For a man's
repentance or regret arises from his changeableness, from the
fluctuations in his desires and actions. This is never the case with
God; consequently He is ישׂראל נצח, the unchangeable One, in whom Israel
can trust, since He does not lie or deceive, or repent of His purposes.
These words are spoken θεοπρεπῶς (theomorphically), whereas in [Sa1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011.md) and other passages, which speak
of God as repenting, the words are to be understood ἀνθρωποπαθῶς
(anthropomorphically; cf. [Num 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019).md).

After this declaration as to the irrevocable character of the
determination of God to reject Saul, Samuel yielded to the renewed
entreaty of Saul, that he would honour him by his presence before the
elders and the people, and remained whilst Saul worshipped, not merely
"for the purpose of preserving the outward order until a new king should
take his place" (O. v. Gerlach), but also to carry out the ban upon
Agag, whom Saul had spared.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032.md)

After Saul had prayed, Samuel directed him to bring Agag the king of the
Amalekites. Agag came מעדנּת, i.e., in a contented and joyous state of
mind, and said (in his heart), "Surely the bitterness of death is
vanished," not from any special pleasure at the thought of death, or
from a heroic contempt of death, but because he thought that his life
was to be granted him, as he had not been put to death at once, and was
now about to be presented to the prophet (Clericus).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 15:33</span></span>

But Samuel pronounced the sentence of death upon him: "As thy sword hath
made women childless, so be thy mother childless before women!" מנּשׁים
is to be understood as a comparative: more childless than (other) women,
i.e., the most childless of women, namely, because her son was the king.
From these words of Samuel, it is very evident that Agag had carried on
his wars with great cruelty, and had therefore forfeited his life
according to the lex talionis. Samuel then hewed him in pieces "before
the Lord at Gilgal," i.e., before the altar of Jehovah there; for the
slaying of Agag being the execution of the ban, was an act performed for
the glory of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">sa1 15:34</span></span>

After the prophet had thus maintained the rights of Jehovah in the
presence of Saul, and carried out the ban upon Agag, he returned to his
own home at Ramah; and Saul went to his house at Gibeah. From that time
forward Samuel broke off all intercourse with the king whom Jehovah had
rejected. "For Samuel was grieved for Saul, and it repented the Lord
that he had made Saul king," i.e., because Samuel had loved Saul on
account of his previous election; and yet, as Jehovah had rejected him
unconditionally, he felt that he was precluded from doing anything to
effect a change of heart in Saul, and his reinstatement as king.
