### [Ezekiel Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 24:1</span></span>

On the day on which the king of Babylon commenced the siege and blockade
of Jerusalem, this event was revealed by God to Ezekiel on the Chaboras
([Eze 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001.md) and [Eze
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#002).md); and he was commanded to predict
to the people through the medium of a parable the fate of the city and
its inhabitants ([Eze 24:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003).md). God
then foretold to him the death of his own wife, and commanded him to
show no sign of mourning on account of it. His wife died the following
evening, and he did as he was commanded. When he was asked by the people
the reason of this, he explained to them, that what he was doing was
symbolical of the way in which they were to act when Jerusalem fell
([Eze 24:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#015).md). The fall would be
announced to the prophet by a fugitive, and then he would no longer
remain mute, but would speak to the people again ([Eze
24:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#025).md). - Apart, therefore, from
the last three verses, this chapter contains two words of God, the first
of which unfolds in a parable the approaching calamities, and the result
of the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans ([Eze
24:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001).md); whilst the second typifies
by means of a sign the pain and mourning of Israel, namely, of the
exiles at the destruction of the city with its sanctuary and its
inhabitants. These two words of God, being connected together by their
contents, were addressed to the prophet on the same day, and that, as
the introduction ([Eze 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001.md) and [Eze
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#002).md) expressly observes, the day on
which the siege of Jerusalem by the king of Babylon began.

And the word of Jehovah came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth
month, on the tenth of the month, saying, [Eze
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#002.md). Son of man, write for thyself
the name of the day, this same day! The king of Babylon has fallen upon
Jerusalem this same day. - The date given, namely, the tenth day of the
tenth month of the ninth year after the carrying away of Jehoiachin
([Eze 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002).md), or what is the same thing,
of the reign of Zedekiah, who was appointed king in his stead, is
mentioned in [Jer 52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004.md); [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md), and [Kg2
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md), as the day on which
Nebuchadnezzar blockaded the city of Jerusalem by throwing up a rampart;
and after the captivity this day was still kept as a fast-day in
consequence ([Zac 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019).md). What was thus
taking place at Jerusalem was revealed to Ezekiel on the Chaboras the
very same day; and he was instructed to announce it to the exiles, "that
they and the besieged might learn both from the time and the result,
that the destruction of the city was not to be ascribed to chance or to
the power of the Babylonians, but to the will of Him who had long ago
foretold that, on account of the wickedness of the inhabitants, the city
would be burned with fire; and that Ezekiel was a true prophet, because
even when in Babylon, which was at so great a distance, he had known and
had publicly announced the state of Jerusalem." The definite character
of this prediction cannot be changed into a vaticinium post eventum,
either by arbitrary explanations of the words, or by the unfounded
hypothesis proposed by Hitzig, that the day was not set down in this
definite form till after the event. - Writing the name of the day is
equivalent to making a note of the day. The reason for this is given in
[Eze 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#002.md), namely, because
Nebuchadnezzar had fallen upon Jerusalem on that very day. סמך signifies
to support, hold up (his hand); and hence both here and in [Psa
88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008.md) the meaning to press violently
upon anything. The rendering "to draw near," which has been forced upon
the word from the Syriac (Ges., Winer, and others), cannot be sustained.

[Ezekiel 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 24:3</span></span>

Parable of the Pot with the Boiling Pieces

[Eze 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md). And relate a parable to the
rebellious house, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Set on
the pot, set on and also pour water into it. [Eze
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#004.md). Gather its pieces of flesh into
it, all the good pieces, haunch and shoulder, fill it with choice bones.
[Eze 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#005.md). Take the choice of the
flock, and also a pile of wood underneath for the bones; make it boil
well, also cook its bones therein. [Eze
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006.md). Therefore, thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Woe! O city of murders! O pot in which is rust, and whose rust
doth not depart from it; piece by piece fetch it out, the lot hath not
fallen upon it. [Eze 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#007.md). For her
blood is in the midst of her; she hath placed it upon the naked rock;
she hath not poured it upon the ground, that they might cover it with
dust. [Eze 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#008.md). To bring up fury, to
take vengeance, I have made her blood come upon the naked rock, that it
might not be covered. [Eze 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#009.md).
Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the city of murders! I
also will make the pile of wood great. [Eze
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#010.md). Heap up the wood, stir the
fire, do the flesh thoroughly, make the broth boil, that the bones may
also be cooked away. [Eze 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#011.md). And
set it empty upon the coals thereof, that its brass may become hot and
glowing, that the uncleanness thereof may melt within it, its rust pass
away. [Eze 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#012.md). He hath exhausted
the pains, and her great rust doth not go from her; into the fire with
her rust! [Eze 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#013.md). In thine
uncleanness is abomination; because I have cleansed thee, and thou hast
not become clean, thou wilt no more become clean from thy uncleanness,
till I quiet my fury upon thee. [Eze
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#014.md). I Jehovah have spoken it; it
cometh, and I will do it; I will not cease, nor spare, nor let it repent
me. According to thy ways, and according to thy deeds, shall they judge
thee, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.

The contents of these verses are called משׁל, a proverb or parable; and
Ezekiel is to communicate them to the refractory generation. It follows
from this that the ensuing act, which the prophet is commanded to
perform, is not to be regarded as a symbolical act which he really
carried out, but that the act forms the substance of the mâshâl, in
other words, belongs to the parable itself. Consequently the
interpretation of the parable in vv. 10ff. is clothed in the form of a
thing actually done. The pot with the pieces of flesh and the bones,
which are to be boiled in it and boiled away, represents Jerusalem with
its inhabitants. The fire, with which they are boiled, is the fire of
war, and the setting of the pot upon the fire is the commencement of the
siege, by which the population of the city is to be boiled away like the
flesh and bones in a pot. שׁפת is used, as in [Kg2
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md), to signify the setting of a pot
by or upon the fire. 'אסף וגו: put in its pieces all together. נתחיה,
its pieces of flesh, i.e., the pieces belonging to the cooking-pot.
These are defined still more minutely as the best of the pieces of
flesh, and of these the thigh (haunch) and shoulder are mentioned as the
most important pieces, to which the choicest of the bones are to be
added. This is rendered still more emphatic by the further instruction
to take the choice of the flock in addition to these. The choicest
pieces of flesh and the pieces of bone denote the strongest and ablest
portion of the population of the city. To boil these pieces away, more
especially the bones, a large fire is requisite. This is indicated by
the words, "and also a pile of wood underneath for the bones." דּוּר in
[Eze 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#005.md), for which מדוּרה is
substituted in [Eze 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#009.md), signifies a
pile of wood, and occurs in this sense in [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md), from דּוּר, to lay round, to
arrange, pile up. דּוּר cannot mean a heap of bones, on account of the
article, but simply a pile of wood for the (previously mentioned) bones,
namely, for the purpose of boiling them away. If we pay attention to the
article, we shall see that the supposition that Ezekiel was to place a
heap of bones under the pot, and the alteration proposed by Bצttcher,
Ewald, and Hitzig of העצמים into \`eeעצים צים, are alike untenable. Even
if דּוּר in itself does not mean a pile of wood, but simply strues, an
irregular heap, the fact that it is wood which is piled up is apparent
enough from the context. If העצמים had grown out of עצים through a
corruption of the text, under the influence of the preceding עצמים, it
would not have had an article prefixed. Hitzig also proposes to alter
רתחיה into נתחיה, though without any necessity. The fact that רתחים does
not occur again proves nothing at all. The noun is added to the verb to
intensify its force, and is plurale tant. in the sense of boiling.
גּם־בּשׁלוּ וגו' is dependent upon the previous clause גּם taking the
place of the copulative ו. בּשׁל, to be cooked, thoroughly done, see the
comm. on [Exo 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#009.md).

In [Eze 24:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006.md) the interpretation of
the parable is given, and that in two trains of thought introduced by
לכן ([Eze 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006.md) and [Eze
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#009).md). The reason for commencing with
לכן, therefore, may be found in the fact that in the parable contained
in [Eze 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md)., or more correctly in
the blockade of Jerusalem, which furnished the occasion for the parable,
the judgment about to burst upon Jerusalem is plainly indicated. The
train of thought is the following: - Because the judgment upon Jerusalem
is now about to commence, therefore woe to her, for her blood-guiltiness
is so great that she must be destroyed. But the punishment answering to
the magnitude of the guilt is so distributed in the two strophes, [Eze
24:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006.md) and [Eze
24:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#009.md), that the first strophe treats
of the punishment of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the second, of the
punishment of the city itself. To account for the latter feature, there
is a circumstance introduced which is not mentioned in the parable
itself, namely, the rust upon the pot, and the figure of the pot is
thereby appropriately extended. Moreover, in the explanation of the
parable the figure and the fact pass repeatedly the one into the other.
Because Jerusalem is a city of murders, it resembles a pot on which
there are spots of rust that cannot be removed. [Eze
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006.md) is difficult, and has been
expounded in various ways. The ל before the twofold נתחיה is, no doubt,
to be taken distributively: according to its several pieces, i.e., piece
by piece, bring it out. But the suffix attached to הוציאהּ cannot be
taken as referring to סיר, as Kliefoth proposes, for this does not yield
a suitable meaning. One would not say: bring out the pot by its pieces
of flesh, when nothing more is meant than the bringing of the pieces of
flesh out of the pot. And this difficulty is not removed by giving to
הוציא the meaning to reach hither. For, apart from the fact that there
is nothing in the usage of the language to sustain the meaning, reach it
hither for the purpose of setting it upon the fire, one would not say:
reach hither the pot according to its several pieces of flesh, piece by
piece, when all that was meant was, bring hither the pot filled with
pieces of flesh. The suffix to הוציאהּ refers to the city (עיר), i.e.,
to its population, "to which the blood-guiltiness really adhered, and
not to its collection of houses" (Hitzig). It is only in appearance also
that the suffix to נתחיה refers to the pot; actually it refers to the
city, i.e., to the whole of its population, the different individuals in
which are the separate pieces of flesh. The meaning of the instructions
therefore is by no means doubtful: the whole of the population to be
found in Jerusalem is to be brought out, and that without any exception,
inasmuch as the lot, which would fall upon one and not upon another,
will not be cast upon her. There is no necessity to seek for any causal
connection between the reference to the rust upon the pot and the
bringing out of the pieces of flesh that are cooking within it, and to
take the words as signifying that all the pieces, which had been
rendered useless by the rust upon the pot, were to be taken out and
thrown away (Hvernick); but through the allusion to the rust the
interpretation already passes beyond the limits of the figure. The
pieces of the flesh are to be brought out, after they have been
thoroughly boiled, to empty the pot, that it may then be set upon the
fire again, to burn out the rust adhering to it ([Eze
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#011).md). There is no force in
Kliefoth's objection, that this exposition does not agree with the
context, inasmuch as, "according to the last clause of [Eze
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#005.md) and [Eze
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#010.md) and [Eze
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#011.md), the pieces of flesh and even
the bones are not to be taken out, but to be boiled away by a strong
fire; and the pot is to become empty not by the fact that the pieces of
flesh are taken out and thrown away, but by the pieces being thoroughly
boiled away, first to broth and then to nothing." For "boiling away to
nothing" is not found in the text, but simply that even the bones are to
be thoroughly done, so as to turn into the softness of jelly. - So far
as the fact is concerned, we cannot follow the majority of commentators,
who suppose that the reference is simply to the carrying away of the
inhabitants into exile. Bringing the pieces of flesh out of the pot,
denotes the sweeping away of the inhabitants from the city, whether by
death (vid., [Eze 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#007).md) or by their
being carried away captive. The city is to be emptied of men in
consequence of its being blockaded by the king of Babylon. The reason of
this is given in [Eze 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#007.md) and [Eze
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#008.md), where the guilt of Jerusalem is
depicted. The city has shed blood, which is not covered with earth, but
has been left uncovered, like blood poured out upon a hard rock, which
the stone cannot absorb, and which cries to God for vengeance, because
it is uncovered (cf. [Gen 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md); [Job
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#018.md); and [Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021).md). The thought is this: she has
sinned in an insolent and shameless manner, and has done nothing to
cover her sin, has shown no sign of repentance or atonement, by which
she might have got rid of her sin. This has all been ordered by God. He
has caused the blood that was shed to fall upon a bare rock, that it
might lie uncovered, and He might be able to execute vengeance for the
crime.

The second turn in the address ([Eze
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#009).md) commences in just the same
manner as the first in [Eze 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006.md), and
proceeds with a further picture of the execution of punishment. To
avenge the guilt, God will make the pile of wood large, and stir up a
fierce fire. The development of this thought is given in [Eze
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#010.md) in the form of a command
addressed to the prophet, to put much wood underneath, and to kindle a
fire, so that both flesh and bones may boil away. התם, from תּמם, to
finish, complete; with בּשׂר, to cook thoroughly. There are differences
of opinion as to the true meaning of הרקח ; but the rendering sometimes
given to רקח, namely, to spice, is at all events unsuitable, and cannot
be sustained by the usage of the language. It is true that in [Exo
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025.md). the verb רקח is used for the
preparation of the anointing oil, but it is not the mixing of the
different ingredients that is referred to, but in all probability the
thorough boiling of the spices, for the purpose of extracting their
essence, so that "thorough boiling" is no doubt the true meaning of the
word. In [Job 41:23](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#023) (31.md), מרקחה is the
boiling unguent-pot. יחרוּ is a cohortative Hiphil, from חרר, to become
red-hot, to be consumed. - [Eze 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#011.md).
When the flesh and bones have thus been thoroughly boiled, the pot is to
be placed upon the coals empty, that the rust upon it may be burned away
by the heat. The emptying of the pot or kettle by pouring out the flesh,
which has been boiled to broth, is passed over as self-evident. The
uncleanness of the pot is the rust upon it. תּתּם is an Aramaean form
for תּתּם = תּתּם. Michaelis has given the true explanation of the
words: "civibus caesis etiam urbs consumetur" (when the inhabitants are
slain, the city itself will be destroyed).

(Note: Hitzig discovers a Hysteronproteron in this description, because
the cleaning of the pot ought to have preceded the cooking of the flesh
in it, and not to have come afterwards, and also because, so far as the
actual fact is concerned, the rust of sin adhered to the people of the
city, and not to the city itself as a collection of houses. But neither
of these objections is sufficient to prove what Hitzig wants to
establish, namely, that the untenable character of the description shows
that it is not really a prophecy; nor is there any force in them. It is
true that if one intended to boil flesh in a pot for the purpose if
eating, the first thing to be done would be to clean the pot itself. But
this is not the object in the present instance. The flesh was simply to
be thoroughly boiled, that it might be destroyed and thrown away, and
there was no necessity to clean the pot for this purpose. And so far as
the second objection is concerned, the defilement of sin does no doubt
adhere to man, though not, as Hitzig assumes, to man alone. According to
the Old Testament view, it extends to things as well (vid., [Lev
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025.md); [Lev
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028).md). Thus leprosy, for example, did
not pollute men only, but clothes and houses also. And for the same
reason judgments were not restricted to men, but also fell upon cities
and lands.)

In [Eze 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#012.md). the reason is given,
which rendered it necessary to inflict this exterminating judgment. In
[Eze 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#012.md) the address still keeps to
the figure, but in [Eze 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#013.md) it
passes over to the actual fact. It (the pot) has exhausted the pains
(תּאנים, ἁπ λεγ.., namely, as [Eze
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#013.md) clearly shows, the pains, or
wearisome exertions, to make it clean by milder means, and not (as
Hitzig erroneously infers from the following clause) to eat away the
rust by such extreme heat. הלאת, third pers. Hiphil of לאה fo lih, is
the earlier form, which fell into almost entire disuse in later times
(vid., Ges. 75, Anm. 1). The last words of [Eze
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#011.md), I agree with Hitzig, Hvernick,
and others, in taking as an exclamation. Because the pot has exhausted
all the efforts made to cleanse it, its rust is to go into the fire. In
[Eze 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#013.md) Jerusalem is addressed, and
זמּה is not a genitive belonging to בּטמאתך, "on account of thy
licentious uncleanness" (Ewald and Hitzig), but a predicate, "in thine
uncleanness is (there lies) זמּה, i.e., an abomination deserving of
death" (see [Lev 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017.md) and [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014.md), where the fleshly sins, which
are designated as zimmâh, are ordered to be punished with death). The
cleansings which God had attempted, but without Jerusalem becoming
clean, consisted in the endeavour, which preceded the Chaldean judgment
of destruction, to convert the people from their sinful ways, partly by
threats and promises communicated through the prophets (vid., [Ch2
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015).md), and partly by means of
chastisements. For הניח חמה, see [Eze
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013.md). In [Eze
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#014.md) there is a summary of the whole,
which brings the threat to a close.

The Sign of Silent Sorrow Concerning the Destruction of Jerusalem

[Eze 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#014.md). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#016.md). Son of
man, behold, I take from thee thine eyes' delight by a stroke, and thou
shalt not mourn nor weep, and no tear shall come from thee. [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017.md). Sigh in silence; lamentation
for the dead thou shalt not make; bind thy head-attire upon thee, and
put thy shoes upon thy feet, and do not cover thy beard, and eat not the
bread of men. [Eze 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#018.md). And I spake
to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died, and I did
in the morning as I was commanded. [Eze
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#019.md). Then the people said to me,
Wilt thou not show us what this signifies to us that thou doest so? [Eze
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#020.md). And I said to them, The word of
Jehovah has come to me, saying, [Eze
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021.md). Say to the house of Israel,
Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the
pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your
soul; and your sons and your daughters, whom ye have left, will fall by
the sword. [Eze 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#022.md). Then will ye do
as I have done, ye will not cover the beard, nor eat the bread of men;
[Eze 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#023.md). And ye will have your
head-attired upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet; ye will not
mourn nor weep, but will pine away in your iniquity, and sigh one
towards another. [Eze 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#024.md). Thus will
Ezekiel be a sign to you; as he hath done will ye do; when it cometh, ye
will know that I the Lord am Jehovah. - From the statements in [Eze
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#018.md), to the effect that the prophet
spoke to the people in the morning, and then in the evening his wife
died, and then again in the (following) morning, according to the
command of God, he manifested no grief, and in answer to the inquiry of
the people explained to them the meaning of what he did, it is evident
that the word of God contained in this section came to him on the same
day as the preceding one, namely, on the day of the blockade of
Jerusalem; for what he said to the people on the morning of this day
([Eze 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#018).md) is the prophecy contained
in [Eze 24:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md). Immediately after He
had made this revelation to him, God also announced to him the
approaching death of his wife, together with the significance which this
event would have to the people generally. The delight of the eyes ([Eze
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#016).md) is his wife ([Eze
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#018).md) בּמגּפה by a stroke, i.e., by a
sudden death inflicted by God (vid., [Num
14:37](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#037.md); [Num
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#013).md). On the occurrence of her
death, he is neither to allow of any loud lamentings, nor to manifest
any sign of grief, but simply to sigh in silence. מתים אבל does not
stand for אבל מתים, but the words are both accusatives. The literal
rendering would be: the dead shalt thou not make an object of mourning,
i.e., thou shalt not have any mourning for the dead, as Storr (observv.
p. 19) has correctly explained the words. On occasions of mourning it
was customary to uncover the head and strew ashes upon it ([Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003).md), to go barefoot ([Sa2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030.md); [Isa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002).md), and to cover the beard, that is
to say, the lower part of the face as far as the nose ([Mic
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007).md). Ezekiel is not to do any of
these things, but to arrange his head-attire (פּאר, the head-attire
generally, or turban, vid., [Eze 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#023.md)
and [Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md), and not specially that
of the priests, which is called פּארי in [Exo
39:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#028).md), and to put on his shoes, and
also to eat no mourning bread. לחם אנשׁים does not mean panis
miseroroum, cibus lugentium, in which case אנשׁים would be equivalent to
אנשׁים, but bread of men, i.e., of the people, that is to say, according
to the context, bread which the people were accustomed to send to the
house of mourning in cases of death, to manifest their sympathy and to
console and refresh the mourners - a custom which gave rise in the
course of time to that of formal funeral meals. These are not mentioned
in the Old Testament; but the sending of bread or food to the house of
mourning is clearly referred to in [Deu
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014.md); [Hos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004.md), and [Jer
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007.md) (see also [Sa2
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#035).md). - When Ezekiel thus abstained
from all lamentation and outward sign of mourning on the death of his
dearest one, the people conjectured that such striking conduct must have
some significance, and asked him what it was that he intended to show
thereby. He then announced to them the word of God ([Eze
24:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#020).md). As his dearest one, his
wife, had been taken from him, so should it dearest object, the holy
temple, be taken from the nation by destruction, and their children by
the sword. When this occurred, then would they act as he was doing now;
they would not mourn and weep, but simply in their gloomy sorrow sigh in
silence on account of their sins, and groan one toward another.

The profanation (חלּל) of the sanctuary is effected through its
destruction (cf. [Eze 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#024).md). To show
the magnitude of the loss, the worth of the temple in the eyes of the
nation is dwelt upon in the following clauses. גּאון עזּכם is taken from
[Lev 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md). The temple is called the
pride of your strength, because Israel based its might and strength upon
it as the scene of the gracious presence of God, living in the hope that
the Lord would not give up His sanctuary to the heathen to be destroyed,
but would defend the temple, and therewith Jerusalem and its inhabitants
also (cf. [Jer 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004).md). מהמל נפשׁכם , the
desire or longing of the soul (from המל, in Arabic, desiderio ferri ad
aliquam rem). The sons and daughters of the people are the relatives and
countrymen whom the exiles had been obliged to leave behind in Canaan. -
The explanation of this lamentation and mourning on account of the
destruction of the sanctuary and death of their relations, is to be
found in the antithesis: 'וּנמקּתם בעו, ye will pine or languish away in
your iniquities (compare [Eze 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#017.md) and
[Lev 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039).md). Consequently we have not
to imagine either "stolid indifference" (Eichhorn and Hitzig), or
"stolid impenitence" (Ewald), but overwhelming grief, for which there
were no tears, no lamentation, but only deep inward sighing on account
of the sins which had occasioned so terrible a calamity. נהם, lit., to
utter a deep growl, like the bears ([Isa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011).md); here to sigh or utter a deep
groan. "One toward another," i.e., manifesting the grief to one another
by deep sighs; not "full of murmuring and seeking the sin which
occasioned the calamity in others rather than in themselves," as Hitzig
supposes. The latter exposition is entirely at variance with the
context. This grief, which consumes the bodily strength, leads to a
clear perception of the sin, and also to true repentance, and through
penitence and atonement to regeneration and newness of life. And thus
will they attain to a knowledge of the Lord through the catastrophe
which bursts upon them (cf. [Lev
26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040)..md). For מופת, a sign, see the
comm. on [Exo 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md).

Sequel of the Destruction of Jerusalem to the Prophet Himself

[Eze 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#025.md). And thou, son of man,
behold, in the day when I take from them their might, their glorious
joy, the delight of their eyes and the desire of their soul, their sons
and their daughters, [Eze 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#026.md). In
that day will a fugitive come to thee, to tell it to thine ears. [Eze
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027.md). In that day will thy mouth be
opened with the fugitive, and thou wilt speak, and no longer be mute;
and thus shalt thou be a sign to them that they may know that I am
Jehovah. - As the destruction of Jerusalem would exert a powerful
influence upon the future history of the exiles on the Chaboras, and be
followed by most important results, so was it also to be a turning-point
for the prophet himself in the execution of his calling. Hvernick has
thus correctly explained the connection between these closing verses and
what precedes, as indicated by ואתּה in [Eze
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#025.md). As Ezekiel up to this time was
to speak to the people only when the Lord gave him a word for them, and
at other times was to remain silent and dumb ([Eze
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026.md) and [Eze
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027).md); from the day on which a
messenger should come to bring him the tidings of the destruction of
Jerusalem and the temple, he was to open his mouth, and not continue
dumb any longer. The execution of this word of God is related in [Eze
33:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021.md). The words, "when I take from
them their strength," etc., are to be understood in accordance with [Eze
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021.md). Consequently מעזּם is the
sanctuary, which was taken from the Israelites through the destruction
of Jerusalem. The predicates which follow down to משּׂא refer to the
temple (cf. [Eze 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021).md). משּׂא נפשׁ,
an object toward which the soul lifts itself up (נשׂא), i.e., for which
it cherishes a desire or longing; hence synonymous with מחמל נפשׁ htiw
suomynon in [Eze 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021.md). The sons and
daughters are attached ἀσυνδετῶς. בּיּום (in that day), in [Eze
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#026.md), which resumes the words 'בּיום
ק (in the day when I take, etc.) in [Eze
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#025.md), is not the day of the
destruction of the temple, but generally the time of this event, or more
precisely, the day on which the tidings would reach the prophet. הפּליט,
with the generic article, a fugitive (vid., [Gen
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013).md). להשׁמעוּת אזנים, to cause the
ears to hear (it), i.e., to relate it, namely to the bodily ears of the
prophet, whereas he had already heard it in spirit from God. השׁמעוּת, a
verbal noun, used instead of the infinitive Hiphil. את־הפּליט, with the
escaped one, i.e., at the same time "with the mouth of the fugitive"
(Hitzig). את expresses association, or so far as the fact is concerned,
simultaneousness. The words,"then wilt thou speak, and no longer be
dumb," do not imply that it was only from that time forward that Ezekiel
was to keep silence, but point back to [Eze
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026.md) and [Eze
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027.md), where silence is imposed upon
him, with the exceptions mentioned there, from the very commencement of
his ministry; and in comparison with that passage, simply involve
implicite the thought that the silence imposed upon him then was to be
observed in the strictest manner from the present time until the
reception of the intelligence of the fall of Jerusalem, when his mouth
would be opened once more. Through the "words of God" that were given to
His prophet (Ezekiel 4-24), the Lord had now said to the people of
Israel all that He had to say concerning the approaching catastrophe for
them to consider and lay to heart, that they might be brought to
acknowledge their sin, and turn with sorrow and repentance to their God.
Therefore was Ezekiel from this time forward to keep perfect silence
toward Israel, and to let God the Lord speak by His acts and the
execution of His threatening words. It was not till after the judgment
had commenced that his mouth was to be opened again for still further
announcements (vid., [Eze 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022).md). -
Ezekiel was thereby to become a sign to the Israelites. These words have
a somewhat different meaning in [Eze
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027.md) from that which they have in
[Eze 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#024.md). There, Ezekiel, by the way
in which he behaved at the death of his wife, was to be a sign to the
people of the manner in which they were to act when the judgment should
fall upon Jerusalem; whereas here ([Eze
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027).md), למופת refers to the whole of
the ministry of the prophet, his silence hitherto, and that which he was
still to observe, as well as his future words. Through both of these he
was to exhibit himself to his countrymen as a man whose silence, speech,
and action were alike marvellous and full of meaning to them, and all
designed to lead them to the knowledge of the Lord, the God of their
salvation.
