### [Psalms Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 21:0</span></span>

Thanksgiving for the King in Time of War

"Jahve fulfil all thy desires" cried the people in the preceding Psalm,
as they interceded on behalf of their king; and in this Psalm they are
able thankfully to say to God "the desire of his heart hast Thou
granted." In both Psalms the people come before God with matters that
concern the welfare of their king; in the former, with their wishes and
prayers, in the latter, their thanksgivings and hopes in the latter as
in the former when in the midst of war, but in the latter after the
recovery of the king, in the certainty of a victorious termination of
the war.

The Targum and the Talmud, B. Succa 52a, understand this [Psa
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md) of the king Messiah. Rashi
remarks that this Messianic interpretation ought rather to be given up
for the sake of the Christians. But even the Christian exposition cannot
surely mean to hold fast this interpretation so directly and rigidly as
formerly. This pair of Psalm treats of David; David's cause, however, in
its course towards a triumphant issue - a course leading through
suffering - is certainly figuratively the cause of Christ.

[Psalms 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 21:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 21:2-3) The Psalm begins with thanksgiving for the bodily and
spiritual blessings which Jahve has bestowed and still continues to
bestow upon the king, in answer to his prayer. This occupies the three
opening tetrastichs, of which these verses form the first. עז (whence
עזּך, as in [Psa 74:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013.md), together with
עזּך, [Psa 63:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#003), and frequently.md) is
the power that has been made manifest in the king, which has turned away
his affliction; ישׁוּעה is the help from above which has freed him out
of his distress. The יגיל, which follows the מה of the exclamation, is
naturally shortened by the Kerמ into יגל (with the retreat of the tone);
cf. on the contrary [Pro 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#024.md), where
מה is interrogative and, according to the sense, negative). The ἁπ. λεγ.
ארשׁת has the signification eager desire, according to the connection,
the lxx δέηεσιν, and the perhaps also cognate רוּשׁ, to be poor; the
Arabic Arab. wrš, avidum esse, must be left out of consideration
according to the laws of the interchange of consonants, whereas ירשׁ,
Arab. wrṯ, capere, captare (cf. Arab. irṯ = wirṯ an inheritance), but
not רוּשׁ (vid., [Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011).md), belongs
apparently to the same root. Observe the strong negation בּל: no, thou
hast not denied, but done the very opposite. The fact of the music
having to strike up here favours the supposition, that the occasion of
the Psalm is the fulfilment of some public, well-known prayer.

[Psalms 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 21:3</span></span>

(Heb.: 21:4-5) "Blessings of good" ([Pro
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#025).md) are those which consist of
good, i.e., true good fortune. The verb קדּם, because used of the favour
which meets and presents one with some blessing, is construed with a
double accusative, after the manner of verbs of putting on and bestowing
(Ges. ֗139). Since [Psa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md) cannot be
intended to refer to David's first coronation, but to the preservation
and increase of the honour of his kingship, this particularisation of
[Psa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md) sounds like a prediction of
what is recorded in [Sa2 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#030.md) : after
the conquest of the Ammonitish royal city Rabbah David set the
Ammonitish crown (עטרת), which is renowned for the weight of its gold
and its ornamentation with precious stones, upon his head. David was
then advanced in years, and in consequence of heavy guilt, which,
however, he had overcome by penitence and laying hold on the mercy of
God, was come to the brink of the grave. He, worthy of death, still
lived; and the victory over the Syro-Ammonitish power was a pledge to
him of God's faithfulness in fulfilling his promises. It is contrary to
the tenour of the words to say that [Psa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005.md) does not refer to length of life,
but to hereditary succession to the throne. To wish any one that he may
live לעולם, and especially a king, is a usual thing, [Kg1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#031.md), and frequently. The meaning is,
may the life of the king be prolonged to an indefinitely distant day.
What the people have desired elsewhere, they here acknowledge as
bestowed upon the king.

[Psalms 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 21:5</span></span>

(Heb.: 21:6-7) The help of God turns to his honour, and paves the way
for him to honour, it enables him-this is the meaning of. [Psa
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md) - to maintain and strengthen his
kingship with fame and glory. שׁוּה על used, as in [Psa
89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020.md), of divine investiture and
endowment. To make blessings, or a fulness of blessing, is a stronger
form of expressing God's words to Abram, [Gen
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md) : thou shalt be a blessing i.e.,
a possessor of blessing thyself, and a medium of blessing to others. Joy
in connection with (את as in [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011).md) the countenance of God, is joy
in delightful and most intimate fellowship with Him. חדּה, from חדה,
which occurs once in [Exo 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#009.md), has in
Arabic, with reference to nomad life, the meaning "to cheer the beasts
of burden with a song and urge them on to a quicker pace," and in
Hebrew, as in Aramaic, the general signification "to cheer, enliven."

[Psalms 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 21:7</span></span>

(Heb.: 21:8-9) With this strophe the second half of the Psalm commences.
The address to God is now changed into an address to the king; not,
however, expressive of the wishes, but of the confident expectation, of
the speakers. Hengstenberg rightly regards [Psa
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md) as the transition to the second
half; for by its objective utterance concerning the king and God, it
separates the language hitherto addressed to God, from the address to
the king, which follows. We do not render [Psa
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md): and trusting in the favour of
the Most High - he shall not be moved; the mercy is the response of the
trust, which (trust) does not suffer him to be moved; on the expression,
cf. [Pro 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#030.md). This inference is now
expanded in respect to the enemies who desire to cause him to totter and
fall. So far from any tottering, he, on the contrary, makes a victorious
assault upon his foes. If the words had been addressed to Jahve, it
ought, in order to keep up the connection between [Psa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md) and [Psa
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md), at least to have been איביו and
שׁנאיו (his, i.e., the king's, enemies). What the people now hope on
behalf of their king, they here express beforehand in the form of a
prophecy. מצא ל (as in [Isa 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010).md) and
מצא seq. acc. (as in [Sa1 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#017).md) are
distinguished as: to reach towards, or up to anything, and to reach
anything, attain it. Supposing ל to represent the accusative, as e.g.,
in [Psa 69:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#006.md), [Psa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md) would be a useless repetition.

[Psalms 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 21:9</span></span>

(Heb.: 21:10-11) Hitherto the Psalm has moved uniformly in synonymous
dipodia, now it becomes agitated; and one feels from its excitement that
the foes of the king are also the people's foes. True as it is, as
Hupfeld takes it, that לעת פּניך sounds like a direct address to Jahve,
[Psa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md) nevertheless as truly
teaches us quite another rendering. The destructive effect, which in
other passages is said to proceed from the face of Jahve, [Psa
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#017.md); [Lev
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006.md); [Lam
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016) (cf. ἔχει θεὸς ἔκδικον ὄμμα.md), is
here ascribed to the face, i.e., the personal appearing ([Sa2
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#011).md) of the king. David's arrival
did actually decide the fall of Rabbath Ammon, of whose inhabitants some
died under instruments of torture and others were cast into brick-kilns,
[Sa2 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026.md). The prospect here moulds
itself according to this fate of the Ammonites. כּתנּוּר אשׁ is a second
accusative to תּשׁיתנו, thou wilt make them like a furnace of fire,
i.e., a burning furnace, so that like its contents they shall entirely
consume by fire (synecdoche continentis pro contento). The figure is
only hinted at, and is differently applied to what it is in [Lam
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#010.md), [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md). [Psa
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md) and [Psa
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md) are intentionally two long
rising and falling wave-like lines, to which succeed, in [Psa
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011.md), two short lines; the latter
describe the peaceful gleaning after the fiery judgment of God that has
been executed by the hand of David. פּרימו, as in [Lam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md); [Hos
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md), is to be understood after the
analogy of the expression פּרי הבּטן. It is the fate of the Amalekites
(cf. [Psa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006)..md), which is here
predicted of the enemies of the king.

[Psalms 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 21:11</span></span>

(Heb.: 21:12-13) And this fate is the merited frustration of their evil
project. The construction of the sentences in [Psa
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012.md) is like [Psa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md); [Psa
119:83](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#083.md); Ew. 362, b. נטה רעה is not to
be understood according to the phrase נטה רשׁת (= פּרשׁ), for this
phrase is not actually found; we have rather, with Hitzig, to compare
[Psa 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#004.md), [Sa2
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#014.md) : to incline evil down upon any
one is equivalent to: to put it over him, so that it may fall in upon
him. נטה signifies "to extend lengthwise," to unfold, but also to bend
by drawing tight. שׁית שׁכם to make into a back, i.e., to make them into
such as turn the back to you, is a more choice expression than נתן ערף,
[Psa 18:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041.md), cf. [Sa1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#009.md); the half segolate form שׁכם, (=
שׁכם) becomes here, in pause, the full segolate form שׁכם. חצּים must be
supplied as the object to תּכונן, as it is in other instances after
הורה, השׁליך, ידה; כּונן חץ, [Psa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002.md), cf. [Psa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014.md), signifies to set the swift arrow
upon the bow-string (מיתר = יתר) = to aim. The arrows hit the front of
the enemy, as the pursuer overtakes them.

[Psalms 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 21:13</span></span>

(Heb.: 21:14) After the song has spread abroad its wings in twice three
tetrastichs, it closes by, as it were, soaring aloft and thus losing
itself in a distich. It is a cry to God for victory in battle, on behalf
of the king. "Be Thou exalted," i.e., manifest Thyself in Thy supernal
([Psa 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006), 12.md) and judicial ([Psa
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007)..md) sovereignty. What these closing
words long to see realised is that Jahve should reveal for world-wide
conquest this גּבוּרה, to which everything that opposes Him must yield,
and it is for this they promise beforehand a joyous gratitude.
