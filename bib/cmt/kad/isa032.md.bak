### [Isaiah Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 32:1</span></span>

For Judah, sifted, delivered, and purified, there now begins a new ear.
Righteous government, as a blessing for the people, is the first
beneficent fruit. "Behold, the king will reign according to
righteousness; and the princes, according to right will they command.
And every one will be like a shelter from the wind, and a covert from
the storm; like water-brooks in a dry place, like the shadow of a
gigantic rock in a languishing land." The kingdom of Asshur is for ever
destroyed; but the kingdom of Judah rises out of the state of confusion
into which it has fallen through its God - forgetting policy and
disregard of justice. King and princes now rule according to the
standards that have been divinely appointed and revealed. The Lamed in
ūlesârı̄m (and the princes) is that of reference (quod attinet ad, as in
[Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md) and [Ecc
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004).md), the exponent of the usual casus
abs. (Ges. 146, 2); and the two other Lameds are equivalent to κατά,
secundum (as in [Jer 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011).md). The
figures in [Isa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md) are the same as
in [Isa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md). The rock of Asshur
(i.e., Sennacherib) has departed, and the princes of Asshur have
deserted their standards, merely to save themselves. The king and
princes of Judah are now the defence of their nation, and overshadow it
like colossal walls of rock. This is the first fruit of the blessing.

[Isaiah 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 32:3</span></span>

The second is an opened understanding, following upon the ban of
hardening. "And the eyes of the seeing no more are closed, and the ears
of the hearing attend. And the heart of the hurried understands to know,
and the tongue of stammerers speaks clear things with readiness." It is
not physical miracles that are predicted here, but a spiritual change.
The present judgment of hardening will be repealed: this is what [Isa
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#003.md) affirms. The spiritual defects,
from which many suffer who do not belong to the worst, will be healed:
this is the statement in [Isa 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#004.md).
The form תּשׁעינה is not the future of שׁעה here, as in [Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md); [Isa
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004.md); [Isa
17:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#007.md) (in the sense of, they will no
longer stare about restlessly and without aim), but of שׁעה = שׁעע, a
metaplastic future of the latter, in the sense of, to be smeared over to
closed (see [Isa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md); [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md); cf., tach in [Isa
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#018).md). On qâshabh (the kal of which
is only met with here), see at [Isa
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007.md). The times succeeding the
hardening, of which Isaiah is speaking here, are "the last times," as
[Isa 6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) clearly shows; though it
does not therefore follow that the king mentioned in [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md) (as in [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)..md) is the Messiah Himself. In [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md) the prophet merely affirms, that
Israel as a national commonwealth will then be governed in a manner well
pleasing to God; here he predicts that Israel as a national congregation
will be delivered from the judgment of not seeing with seeing eyes, and
not hearing with hearing ears, and that it will be delivered from
defects of weakness also. The nimhârı̄m are those that fall headlong, the
precipitate, hurrying, or rash; and the עלּגים, stammerers, are not
scoffers ([Isa 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md)., [Isa
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#020).md), as Knobel and Drechsler
maintain, but such as are unable to think and speak with distinctness
and certainty, more especially concerning the exalted things of God. The
former would now have the gifts of discernment (yâbhı̄n), to perceive
things in their true nature, and to distinguish under all circumstances
that which is truly profitable (lâda‛ath); the latter would be able to
express themselves suitably, with refinement, clearness, and worthiness.
Tsachōth (old ed. tsâchōth) signifies that which is light, transparent;
not merely intelligible, but refined and elegant. תּמהר gives the
adverbial idea to ledabbēr (Ewald, 285, a).

[Isaiah 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 32:5</span></span>

A third fruit of the blessing is the naming and treating of every one
according to his true character. "The fool will no more be called a
nobleman, nor the crafty a gentleman. For a fool speaks follies, and his
heart does godless things, to practise tricks and to speak error against
Jehovah, to leave the soul of hungry men empty, and to withhold the
drink of thirsty ones. And the craft of a crafty man is evil, who
devises stratagems to destroy suffering ones by lying words, even when
the needy exhibits his right. But a noble man devises noble things, and
to noble things he adheres." Nobility of birth and wealth will give
place to nobility of character, so that the former will not exist or not
be recognised without the latter. Nâdı̄bh is properly one who is noble in
character, and then, dropping the ethical meaning, one who is noble by
rank. The meaning of the word generosus follows the same course in the
opposite direction. Shōă‛ is the man who is raised to eminence by the
possession of property; the gentleman, as in [Job
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019.md). The prophet explains for
himself in what sense he uses the words nâbhâl and kı̄lai. We see from
his explanation that kı̄lai neither signifies the covetous, from kūl
(Saad.), nor the spendthrift, from killâh (Hitzig). Jerome gives the
correct rendering, viz., fraudulentus; and Rashi and Kimchi very
properly regard it as a contraction of nekhı̄lai. It is an adjective form
derived from כּיל = נכיל, like שׂיא = נשׂיא ([Job
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#006).md). The form כּלי in [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md) is used interchangeably with
this, merely for the sake of the resemblance in sound to כּליו
(machinatoris machinae pravae). In [Isa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#006), commencing with ki (for.md), the
fact that the nâbhâl (fool) and kı̄lai (crafty man) will lose their
titles of honour, is explained on the simple ground that such men are
utterly unworthy of them. Nâbhâl is a scoffer at religion, who thinks
himself an enlightened man, and yet at the same time has the basest
heart, and is a worthless egotist. The infinitives with Lamed show in
what the immorality ('âven) consists, with which his heart is so
actively employed. In [Isa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#006.md),
ūbhedabbēr ("and if he speak") is equivalent to, "even in the event of a
needy man saying what is right and well founded:" Vâv = et in the sense
of etiam ((cf., [Sa2 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#023.md); [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012.md); [Hos
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006.md); [Ecc
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006).md); according to Knobel, it is
equivalent to et quidem, as in [Ecc
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md); [Amo
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#011.md); [Amo
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#010.md); whereas Ewald regards it as Vav
conj. (283, d), "and by going to law with the needy," but את־אביון would
be the construction in this case (vid., [Kg2
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#006).md). According to [Isa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#008.md), not only does the noble man
devise what is noble, but as such (הוּא) he adheres to it. We might also
adopt this explanation, "It is not upon gold or upon chance that he
rises;" but according to the Arabic equivalents, qūm signifies
persistere here.

[Isaiah 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 32:9</span></span>

This short address, although rounded off well, is something more than a
fragment complete in itself, like the short parabolic piece in [Isa
28:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#023.md), which commences in a similar
manner. It is the last part of the fourth woe, just as that was the last
part of the first. It is a side piece to the threatening prophecy of the
time of Uzziah-Jotham ([Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016)..md),
and chastises the frivolous self-security of the women of Jerusalem,
just as the former chastises their vain and luxurious love of finery.
The prophet has now uttered many a woe upon Jerusalem, which is bringing
itself to the verge of destruction; but notwithstanding the fact that
women are by nature more delicate, and more easily affected and alarmed,
than men, he has made no impression upon the women of Jerusalem, to whom
he now foretells a terrible undeceiving of their carnal ease, whilst he
holds out before them the ease secured by God, which can only be
realized on the ruins of the former.

The first part of the address proclaims the annihilation of their false
ease. "Ye contented women, rise up, hear my voice; ye confident
daughters, hearken to my speech! Days to the year: then will ye tremble,
confident ones! for it is all over with the vintage, the fruit harvest
comes to nought. Tremble, contented ones! Quake, ye confident ones!
Strip, make yourselves bare, and gird your loins with sackcloth! They
smite upon their breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
On the land of my people there come up weeds, briers; yea, upon all
joyous houses of the rejoicing city. For the palace is made solitary;
the crowd of the city is left desolate; the ofel and watch-tower serve
as caves for ever, for the delight of wild asses, for the tending of
flocks." The summons is the same as in [Gen
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#023.md) and [Jer
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#019.md) (comp. [Isa
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#023).md); the attributes the same as in
[Amo 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md) (cf., [Isa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md), where Isaiah apostrophizes the
women of Samaria). שׁאנן, lively, of good cheer; and בּטח, trusting,
namely to nothing. They are to rise up (qōmnâh), because the word of God
must be heard standing ([Jdg 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#020).md).
The definition of the time "days for a year" (yâmı̄m ‛al-shânâh) appears
to indicate the length of time that the desolation would last, as the
word tirgaznâh is without any Vav apod. (cf., [Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024.md); [Job
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016).md); but [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md) shows us differently, and the Vav
is omitted, just as it is, for example, in [Dan
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#028.md). Shânâh is the current year. In
an undefined number of days, at the most a year from the present time
(which is sometimes the meaning of yâmı̄m), the trembling would begin,
and there would be neither grapes nor fruit to gather. Hence the spring
harvest of corn is supposed to be over when the devastation begins. ימים
is an acc. temporis; it stands here (as in [Isa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006.md), for example; vid., Ewald, 293,
1) to indicate the starting point, not the period of duration. The
milel-forms פּשׁטה, ערה, חגרה ,ערה , are explained by Ewald, Drechsler,
and Luzzatto, as plur. fem. imper. with the Nun of the termination nâh
dropped - an elision that is certainly never heard of. Others regard it
as inf. with He femin. (Credner, Joel, p. 151); but קטלה for the
infinitive קטלה is unexampled; and equally unexampled would be the inf.
with He indicating the summons, as suggested by Bttcher, "to the
shaking!" "to the stripping!" They are sing. masc. imper., such as occur
elsewhere apart from the pause, e.g., מלוכה (for which the keri has
מלכה) in [Jdg 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008.md); and the singular in
the place of the plural is the strongest form of command. The masculine
instead of the feminine appears already in הרדוּ, which is used in the
place of חרדנה. The prophet then proceeds in the singular number,
comprehending the women as a mass, and using the most massive
expression. The He introduced into the summons required that the
feminine forms, רגזי, etc., should be given up. ערה, from ערר, to be
naked, to strip one's self. חגרה absolute, as in [Joe
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013.md) (cf., [Isa
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024).md), signifies to gird one's self
with sackcloth (saq). We meet with the same remarkable enall. generis in
[Isa 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#012.md). Men have no breasts
(shâdaim), and yet the masculine sōphedı̄m is employed, inasmuch as the
prophet had the whole nation in his mind, throughout which there would
be such a plangere ubera on account of the utter destruction of the
hopeful harvest of corn and wine. Shâdaim (breasts) and שׂדי (construct
to sâdōth) have the same common ring as ubera and ubertas frugum. In
[Isa 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013.md) ta‛ăleh points back to qōts
shâmı̄r, which is condensed into one neuter idea. The ki in [Isa
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013.md) has the sense of the Latin imo
(Ewald, 330, b). The genitive connection of עלּיזה קריה with משׂושׂ
בּתּי (joy-houses of the jubilant city) is the same as in [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md). The whole is grammatically
strange, just as in the Psalms the language becomes all the more
complicated, disjointed, and difficult, the greater the wrath and
indignation of the poet. Hence the short shrill sentences in [Isa
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#014.md) : palace given up (cf., [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022).md); city bustle forsaken (i.e.,
the city generally so full of bustle, [Isa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002).md). The use of בּעד is the same as
in [Pro 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#026.md); [Job
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004.md). ‛Ofel, i.e., the south-eastern
fortified slope of the temple mountain, and the bachan (i.e., the
watch-tower, possibly the flock-tower which is mentioned in [Mic
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008) along with ‛ofel.md), would be pro
speluncis, i.e., would be considered and serve as such. And in the very
place where the women of Jerusalem had once led their life of gaiety,
wild asses would now have their delight, and flocks their pasture (on
the wild asses, perâ'ı̄m, that fine animal of the woodless steppe, see at
[Job 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005.md); [Job
39:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005).md). Thus would Jerusalem, with
its strongest, proudest places, be laid in ruins, and that in a single
year, or ever less than a year.

[Isaiah 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 32:15</span></span>

The state would then continue long, very long, until at last the
destruction of the false rest would be followed by the realization of
the true. "Until the Spirit is poured out over us from on high, and the
wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is counted
as the forest. And justice makes its abode in the desert, and
righteousness settles down upon the fruit-field. And the effect of
righteousness will be peace, and the reward of righteousness rest and
security for ever. And my people dwells in a place of peace, and in
trustworthy, safe dwellings, and in cheerful resting-places. And it
hails with the overthrow of the forest, and into lowliness must the city
be brought low." There is a limit, therefore, to the "for ever" of [Isa
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#014.md). The punishment would last till
the Spirit, which Israel had not then dwelling in the midst of it (see
[Hag 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005).md), and whose fulness was like
a closed vessel to Israel, should be emptied out over Israel from the
height of heaven (compare the piel ערה, [Gen
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#020).md), i.e., should be poured out in
all its fulness. When that was done, a great change would take place,
the spiritual nature of which is figuratively represented in the same
proverbial manner as in [Isa 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md). At
the same time, a different turn is given to the second half in the
passage before us. The meaning is, not that what was now valued as a
fruit-bearing garden would be brought down from its false eminence, and
be only regarded as forest; but that the whole would be so glorious,
that what was now valued as a fruit-garden, would be thrown into the
shade by something far more glorious still, in comparison with which it
would have the appearance of a forest, in which everything grew wild.
The whole land, the uncultivated pasture-land as well as the planted
fruitful fields of corn and fruit, would then become the tent and seat
of justice and righteousness. "Justice and righteousness' (mishpât and
tsedâqâh) are throughout Isaiah the stamp of the last and perfect time.
As these advance towards self-completion, the produce and result of
these will be peace (ma‛ăseh and abhōdâh are used to denote the fruit or
self-reward of work and painstaking toil; compare פּעלּה). But two
things must take place before this calm, trustworthy, happy peace, of
which the existing carnal security is only a caricature, can possibly be
realized. In the first place, it must hail, and the wood must fall,
being beaten down with hail. We already know, from [Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034.md), that "the wood" was an emblem
of Assyria; and in [Isa 30:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md), we
find "the hail" mentioned as one of the forces of nature that would
prove destructive to Assyria. And secondly, "the city" (העיר, a play
upon the word, and a counterpart to היּער) must first of all be brought
low into lowliness (i.e., be deeply humiliated). Rosenmller and others
suppose the imperial city to be intended, according to parallels taken
from chapters 24-27; but in this cycle of prophecies, in which the
imperial city is never mentioned at all, "the city" must be Jerusalem,
whose course from the false peace to the true lay through a humiliating
punishment ([Isa 29:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002.md); [Isa
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019.md)., [Isa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004)..md).

[Isaiah 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 32:20</span></span>

In the face of this double judgment, the prophet congratulates those who
will live to see the times after the judgment. "Blessed are ye that sow
by all waters, and let the foot of the oxen and asses rove in freedom."
Those who lived to see these times would be far and wide the lords of a
quiet and fruitful land, cleared of its foes, and of all disturbers of
peace. They would sow wherever they pleased, by all the waters that
fertilized the soil, and therefore in a soil of the most productive
kind, and one that required little if any trouble to cultivate. And
inasmuch as everything would be in the most copious abundance, they
would no longer need to watch with anxiety lest their oxen and asses
should stray into the corn-fields, but would be able to let them wander
wherever they pleased. There cannot be the slightest doubt that this is
the correct explanation of the verse, according to [Isa
30:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#023.md) (compare also [Isa
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#021)..md).

This concludes the four woes, from which the fifth, that immediately
follows, is distinguished by the fact, that in the former the Assyrian
troubles are still in the future, whereas the fifth places us in the
very midst of them. The prophet commenced ([Isa
28:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001).md) with the destruction of
Samaria; he then threatened Judah and Jerusalem also. But it is
uncommonly difficult to combine the different features of the threat
into a complete picture. Sifting even to a small remnant is a leading
thought, which runs through the threat. And we also read throughout the
whole, that Asshur will meet with its own destruction in front of that
very Jerusalem which it is seeking to destroy. But the prophet also
knows, on the one hand, that Jerusalem is besieged by the Assyrians, and
will not be rescued till the besieged city has been brought to the last
extremity ([Isa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)., [Isa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004)..md); and, on the other hand, that
this will reach even to the falling of the towers ([Isa
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025).md), the overthrow of the wall of
the state ([Isa 30:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#013).md), the
devastation of the land, and the destruction of Jerusalem itself ([Isa
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#012)..md); and for both of these he
fixes the limit of a year ([Isa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md);
[Isa 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010).md). This double threat may be
explained in the following manner. The judgments which Israel has still
to endure, and the period of glory that will follow them, lie before the
mental eye of the prophet like a long deep diorama. While threatening
the existing generation, he penetrates more or less deeply into the
judgments which lie in perspective before him. He threatens at one time
merely a siege that will continue till it is brought to the utmost
extremity; at another time utter destruction. But the imperial power
intended, by which this double calamity is to be brought upon Judah,
must be Assyria; since the prophet knew of no other in the earliest
years of Hezekiah, when these threatening addresses were uttered. And
this gives rise to another difficulty. Not only was the worst prediction
- namely, that of the destruction of Jerusalem - not fulfilled; but even
the milder prophecy - namely, that of a siege, which would bring them to
the deepest distress - was not accomplished. There never was any actual
siege of Jerusalem by the Assyrians. The explanation of this is, that,
according to [Jer 18:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007.md), and [Jer
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#009.md), [Jer
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#010.md), neither the threatenings of
punishment nor the promises of blessing uttered by the prophets were so
unconditional, that they were certain to be fulfilled and that with
absolute necessity, at such and such a time, or upon such and such a
generation. The threatened punishment might be repealed or modified, if
repentance ensued on the part of the persons threatened ([Jon
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#004.md); [Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md); [Kg2
22:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#015.md); [Ch2
12:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#005).md). The words of the prophecy did
not on that account fall to the ground. If they produced repentance,
they answered the very purpose for which they were intended; but if the
circumstances which called for punishment should return, their force
returned as well in all its fulness. If the judgment was one irrevocably
determined, it was merely delayed by this, to be discharged upon the
generation which should be ripest for it. And we have also an express
historical testimony, which shows that this is the way in which the
non-fulfilment of what Isaiah threatened as about to take place within a
year is to be accounted for. Not only Isaiah, but also his contemporary
Micah, threatened, that along with the judgment upon Samaria, the same
judgment would also burst upon Jerusalem. Zion would be ploughed as a
field, Jerusalem would be laid in ruins, and the temple mountain would
be turned into a wooded height ([Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012).md). This prophecy belongs to the
first year of Hezekiah's reign, for it was then that the book of Micah
was composed. But we read in [Jer
26:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018.md), that, in their alarm at this
prophecy, Hezekiah and all Judah repented, and that Jehovah withdrew His
threat in consequence. Thus, in the very first year of Hezekiah, a
change for the better took place in Judah; and this was necessarily
followed by the withdrawal of Isaiah's threatenings, just as those
threatenings had co-operated in the production of this conversion (see
Caspari, Micha, p. 160ff.). Not one of the three threats ([Isa
29:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md); [Isa
32:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009.md); [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012).md), which form an ascending climax,
was fulfilled. Previous threatenings so far recovered their original
force, when the insincerity of the conversion became apparent, that the
Assyrians did unquestionably march through Judah, devastating everything
as they went along. But because of Hezekiah's self-humiliation and
faith, the threat was turned from that time forward into a promise. In
direct opposition to his former threatening, Isaiah now promised that
Jerusalem would not be besieged by the Assyrians ([Isa
37:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#033).md), but that, before the siege
was actually established, Assyria would fall under the walls of
Jerusalem.
