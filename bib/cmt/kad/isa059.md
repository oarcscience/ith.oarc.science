### [Isaiah Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 59:1</span></span>

This second prophetic address continues the reproachful theme of the
first. In the previous prophecy we found the virtues which are
well-pleasing to God, and to which He promises redemption as a reward of
grace, set in contrast with those false means, upon which the people
rested their claim to redemption. In the prophecy before us the sins
which retard redemption are still more directly exposed. "Behold,
Jehovah's hand is not too short to help, nor His ear too heavy to hear;
but your iniquities have become a party-wall between you and your God,
and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He does not hear."
The reason why redemption is delayed, is not that the power of Jehovah
has not been sufficient for it (cf., [Isa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002).md), or that He has not been aware
of their desire for it, but that their iniquities (עונתיכם with the
second syllable defective) have become dividers (מבדּלים, defective),
have grown into a party-wall between them and their God, and their sins
(cf., [Jer 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#025).md) have hidden pânı̄m
from them. As the "hand" (yâd) in [Isa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002.md) is the absolute hand; so here the
"face" pânı̄m) is that face which sees everything, which is everywhere
present, whether uncovered or concealed; which diffuses light when it
unveils itself, and leaves darkness when it is veiled; the sight of
which is blessedness, and not to see which is damnation. This absolute
countenance is never to be seen in this life without a veil; but the
rejection and abuse of grace make this veil a perfectly impenetrable
covering. And Israel had forfeited in this way the light and sight of
this countenance of God, and had raised a party-wall between itself and
Him, and that משּׁמוע, so that He did not hear, i.e., so that their
prayer did not reach Him ([Lam 3:44](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#044).md)
or bring down an answer from Him.

[Isaiah 59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 59:3</span></span>

The sins of Israel are sins in words and deeds. "For your hands are
defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips speak
lies, your tongue murmurs wickedness." The verb גּאל, to spot (see [Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003).md), is a later softening down of
גּעל (e.g., [Sa2 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#021).md); and in the
place of the niphal נגאל ([Zep 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001).md),
we have here, as in [Lam 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md), the
double passive form נגאל, compounded of niphal and pual. The
post-biblical nithpal, compounded of the niphal and the hithpael, is a
mixed form of the same kind, though we also meet with it in a few
biblical passages ([Deu 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#008.md); [Pro
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015.md); [Eze
23:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#048)). The verb hâgâh (lxx μελετᾶ.md)
combines the two meanings of "thought" (meditation or reflection), and
of a light low "expression," half inward half outward.

[Isaiah 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 59:4</span></span>

The description now passes over to the social and judicial life. Lying
and oppression universally prevail. "No one speaks with justice, and no
one pleads with faithfulness; men trust in vanity, and speak with
deception; they conceive trouble, and bring forth ruin. They hatch
basilisks' eggs, and weave spiders' webs. He that eateth of their eggs
must die; and if one is trodden upon, it splits into an adder. Their
webs do not suffice for clothing, and men cannot cover themselves with
their works: their works are works of ruin, and the practice of
injustice is in their hands." As קרא is generally used in these
prophetic addresses in the sense of κηρύσσειν, and the judicial meaning,
citare, in just vocare, litem intendere, cannot be sustained, we must
adopt this explanation, "no one gives public evidence with justice" (lxx
οὐδεὶς λαλεῖ δίκαια). צדק is firm adherence to the rule of right and
truth; אמוּנה a conscientious reliance which awakens trust; משׁפּט (in a
reciprocal sense, as in [Isa 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026.md);
[Isa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016).md) signifies the commencement
and pursuit of a law-suit with any one. The abstract infinitives which
follow in [Isa 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004.md) express the
general characteristics of the social life of that time, after the
manner of the historical infinitive in Latin (cf., [Isa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#005); Ges. 131, 4, b.md). Men trust in
tōhū, that which is perfectly destitute of truth, and speak שׁוא, what
is morally corrupt and worthless. The double figure און והוליד עמל הרו
is taken from [Job 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035.md) (cf., [Psa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015).md). הרו (compare the poel in [Isa
59:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#013).md) is only another form for הרה
(Ges. 131, 4, b); and הוליד (the western or Palestinian reading here),
or הולד (the oriental or Babylonian reading), is the usual form of the
inf. abs. hiph. (Ges. 53, Anm. 2). What they carry about with them and
set in operation is compared in [Isa
59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005.md) to basilisks' eggs (צפעוני,
serpens regulus, as in [Isa 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008).md) and
spiders' webs (עכּבישׁ, as in [Job
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014.md), from עכּב, possibly in the sense
of squatter, sitter still, with the substantive ending ı̄sh). They hatch
basilisks' eggs (בּקּע like בּקע, [Isa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015.md), a perfect, denoting that which
has hitherto always taken place and therefore is a customary thing); and
they spin spiders' webs (ארג possibly related to ἀράχ-νη;

(Note: Neither καῖρος nor ἀράχνη has hitherto been traced to an Indian
root in any admissible way. Benfey deduces the former from the root
dhvir (to twist); but this root has to perform an immense number of
services. M. Mller deduces the latter from rak; but this means to make,
not to spin.)

the future denoting that which goes on occurring). The point of
comparison in the first figure is the injurious nature of all they do,
whether men rely upon it, in which case "he that eateth of their eggs
dieth," or whether they are bold or imprudent enough to try and
frustrate their plans and performances, when that (the egg) which is
crushed or trodden upon splits into an adder, i.e., sends out an adder,
which snaps at the heel of the disturber of its rest. זוּר as in [Job
39:15](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#015.md), here the part. pass. fem. like
סוּרה ([Isa 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021).md), with a - instead
of ā - like לנה, the original ă of the feminine (zūrăth) having returned
from its lengthening into ā to the weaker lengthening into ĕ. The point
of comparison in the second figure is the worthlessness and deceptive
character of their works. What they spin and make does not serve for a
covering to any man (יתכּסּוּ with the most general subject: Ges. 137,
3), but has simply the appearance of usefulness; their works are
מעשׂי־און (with metheg, not munach, under the Mem), evil works, and
their acts are all directed to the injury of their neighbour, in his
right and his possession.

[Isaiah 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 59:7</span></span>

This evil doing of theirs rises even to hatred, the very opposite of
that love which is well-pleasing to God. "Their feet run to evil, and
make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of
wickedness; wasting and destruction are in their paths." Paul has
interwoven this passage into his description of the universal corruption
of morals, in [Rom 3:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015.md). The
comparison of life to a road, and of a man's conduct to walking, is very
common in proverbial sayings. The prophet has here taken from them both
his simile and his expressions. We may see from [Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md), that during the captivity the
true believers were persecuted even to death by their countrymen, who
had forgotten God. The verbs ירוּצוּ and וימהרוּ (the proper reading,
with metheg, not munach, under the מ) depict the pleasure taken in
wickedness, when the conscience is thoroughly lulled to sleep.

[Isaiah 59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 59:8</span></span>

Their whole nature is broken up into discord. "The way of peace they
know not, and there is no right in their roads: they make their paths
crooked: every one who treads upon them knows no peace." With דּרך, the
way upon which a man goes, the prophet uses interchangeably (here and in
[Isa 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007).md) מסלּה, a high-road thrown
up with an embankment; מעגּל (with the plural in ı̂m and ôth), a
carriage-road; and נתיבה, a footpath formed by the constant passing to
and fro of travellers. Peaceable conduct, springing form a love of
peace, and aiming at producing peace, is altogether strange to them; no
such thing is to be met with in their path as the recognition of
practice of right: they make their paths for themselves (להם, dat.
ethicus), i.e., most diligently, twisting about; and whoever treads upon
them (bâh, neuter, as in [Isa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004).md),
forfeits all enjoyment of either inward or outward peace. Shâlōm is
repeated significantly, in Isaiah's peculiar style, at the end of the
verse. The first strophe of the prophecy closes here: it was from no
want of power or willingness on the part of God, that He had not come to
the help of His people; the fault lay in their own sins.

[Isaiah 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 59:9</span></span>

In the second strophe the prophet includes himself when speaking of the
people. They now mourn over that state of exhaustion into which they
have been brought through the perpetual straining and disappointment of
expectation, and confess those sins on account of which the
righteousness and salvation of Jehovah have been withheld. The prophet
is speaking communicatively here; for even the better portion of the
nation was involved in the guilt and consequences of the corruption
which prevailed among the exiles, inasmuch as a nation forms an
organized whole, and the delay of redemption really affected them.
"Therefore right remains far from us, and righteousness does not
overtake us; we hope for light, and behold darkness; for brightness - we
walk in thick darkness. We grope along the wall like the blind, and like
eyeless men we grope: we stumble in the light of noon-day as in the
darkness, and among the living like the dead. We roar all like bears,
and moan deeply like doves: we hope for right, and it cometh not; for
salvation - it remaineth far off from us." At the end of this group of
verses, again, the thought with which it sets out is palindromically
repeated. The perfect רחקה denotes a state of things reaching from the
past into the present; the future תשּׂיגנוּ a state of things continuing
unchangeable in the present. By mishpât we understand a solution of
existing inequalities or incongruities through the judicial
interposition of God; by tsedâqâh the manifestation of justice, which
bestows upon Israel grace as its right in accordance with the plan of
salvation after the long continuance of punishment, and pours out
merited punishment upon the instruments employed in punishing Israel.
The prophet's standpoint, whether a real or an ideal one, is the last
decade of the captivity. At that time, about the period of the Lydian
war, when Cyrus was making one prosperous stroke after another, and yet
waited so long before he turned his arms against Babylon, it may easily
be supposed that hope and despondency alternated incessantly in the
minds of the exiles. The dark future, which the prophet penetrated in
the light of the Spirit, was indeed broken up by rays of hope, but it
did not amount to light, i.e., to a perfect lighting up (negōhōth, an
intensified plural of negōhâh, like nekhōchōth in [Isa
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010.md), pl. of nekhōchâh in [Isa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014).md); on the contrary, darkness was
still the prevailing state, and in the deep thick darkness ('ăphēlōth)
the exiles pined away, without the promised release being effected for
them by the oppressor of the nations. "We grope," they here complain,
"like blind men by a wall, in which there is no opening, and like
eyeless men we grope." גּשּׁשׁ (only used here) is a synonym of the
older משּׁשׁ ([Deu 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029).md); נגשׁשׁה
(with the elision of the reduplication, which it is hardly possible to
render audible, and which comes up again in the pausal נגשּׁשׁה) has the
âh of force, here of the impulse to self-preservation, which leads them
to grope for an outlet in this ἀπορία; and עינים אין is not quite
synonymous with עורים, for there is such a thing as blindness with
apparently sound eyes (cf., [Isa
43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008).md); and there is also a real
absence of eyes, on account of either a natural malformation, or the
actual loss of the eyes through either external injury or disease.

In the lamentation which follows, "we stumble in the light of noon-day
(צהרים, meridies = mesidies, the culminating point at which the eastern
light is separated from the western) as if it were darkness, and
בּאשׁמנּים, as if we were dead men," we may infer from the parallelism
that since בּאשׁמנּים must express some antithesis to כּמּתים, it cannot
mean either in caliginosis (Jer., Luther, etc.), or "in the graves"
(Targ., D. Kimchi, etc.), or "in desolate places" (J. Kimchi). Moreover,
there is no such word in Hebrew as אשׁם, to be dark, although the
lexicographers give a Syriac word אוּתמנא, thick darkness (possibly
related to Arab. ‛atamat, which does not mean the dark night, but late
in the night); and the verb shâmēn, to be fat, is never applied to "fat,
i.e., thick darkness," as Knobel assumes, whilst the form of the word
with נ c. dagesh precludes the meaning a solitary place or desert (from
אשׁם = שׁמם). The form in question points rather to the verbal stem
שׁמן, which yields a fitting antithesis to כמתים, whether we explain it
as meaning "in luxuriant fields," or "among the fat ones, i.e., those
who glory in their abundant health." We prefer the latter, since the
word mishmannı̄m ([Dan 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#024.md); cf., [Gen
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#028).md) had already been coined to
express the other idea; and as a rule, words formed with א prosth. point
rather to an attributive than to a substantive idea. אשׁמן is a more
emphatic form of שׁמן ([Jdg 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#029).md);

(Note: The name of the Phoenician god of health and prosperity, viz.,
Esmoun, which Alois Mller (Esmun, ein Beitrag zur Mythologie des orient.
Alterthums. 1864) traces to חשׁמן ([Psa
68:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#032).md) from אשׁם = חשׁם, "the splendid
one (illustris)," probably means "the healthy one, or one of full
health" (after the form אשׁחוּר, אשׁמוּרה), which agrees somewhat better
with the account of Photios: ̓́Εσμουνον ὑπὸ Φοινίκων ὠνομασμένον ἐπὶ τῇ
θέρμη τῆς ζωῆς.)

and אשׁמנּים indicates indirectly the very same thing which is directly
expressed by משׁמנּים in [Isa 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md).
Such explanations as "in opimis rebus" (Stier, etc.), or "in fatness of
body, i.e., fulness of life" (Bttcher), are neither so suitable to the
form of the word, nor do they answer to the circumstances referred to
here, where all the people in exile are speaking. The true meaning
therefore is, "we stumble (reel about) among fat ones, or those who lead
a merry life," as if we were dead. "And what," as Doederlein observes,
"can be imagined more gloomy and sad, than to be wandering about like
shades, while others are fat and flourishing?" The growling and moaning
in [Isa 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011.md) are expressions of
impatience and pain produced by longing. The people now fall into a
state of impatience, and roar like bears (hâmâh like fremere), as when,
for example, a bear scents a flock, and prowls about it (vespertinus
circumgemit ursus ovile: Hor. Ep. xvi. 51); and now again they give
themselves up to melancholy, and moan in a low and mournful tone like
the doves, quarum blanditias verbaque murmur habet (Ovid). הגה, like
murmurare, expresses less depth of tone or raucitas than המה. All their
looking for righteousness and salvation turns out again and again to be
nothing but self-deception, when the time for their coming seems close
at hand.

[Isaiah 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 59:12</span></span>

The people have already indicated by על־כּן in [Isa
59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md) that this benighted, hopeless
state is the consequence of their prevailing sins; they now come back to
this, and strike the note of penitence (viddui), which is easily
recognised by the recurring rhymes ānu and ênu. The prophet makes the
confession (as in [Jer 14:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019.md), cf.,
[Isa 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021)..md), standing at the head of
the people as the leader of their prayer (ba‛al tephillâh): "For our
transgressions are many before Thee, and our sins testify against us;
for our transgressions are known to us, and our evil deeds well known:
apostasy and denial of Jehovah, and turning back from following our God,
oppressive and false speaking, receiving and giving out from the heart
words of falsehood." The people acknowledge the multitude and magnitude
of their apostate deeds, which are the object of the omniscience of God,
and their sins which bear witness against them (ענתה the predicate of a
neuter plural; Ges. 146, 3). The second כּי resumes the first: "our
apostate deeds are with us (את as in [Job
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003.md); cf., עם, [Job
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#009).md), i.e., we are conscious of them;
and our misdeeds, we know them" (ידענוּם for ידענון, as in [Gen
41:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#021.md), cf., [Isa
59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008.md), and with ע, as is always the
case with verbs ל ע before נ, and with a suffix; Ewald, 60). The sins
are now enumerated in [Isa 59:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#013.md) in
abstract infinitive forms. At the head stands apostasy in thought and
deed, which is expressed as a threefold sin. בּה (of Jehovah) belongs to
both the "apostasy" (treachery; e.g., [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002).md) and the "denial" ([Jer
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012).md). נסוג is an inf. abs. (different
from [Psa 80:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#019).md). Then follow sins
against the neighbour: viz., such speaking as leads to oppression, and
consists of sârâh, that which deviates from or is opposed to the law and
truth ([Deu 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#016).md); also the
conception (concipere) of lying words, and the utterance of them from
the heart in which they are conceived ([Mat
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#018.md); [Mat
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#035).md). הרו and הגו are the only poel
infinitives which occur in the Old Testament, just as שׁושׂתי ([Isa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013).md) is the only example of a poel
perfect of a verb ל ה. The pol is suitable throughout this passage,
because the action expressed affects others, and is intended to do them
harm. According to Ewald, the poel indicates the object or tendency: it
is the conjugation employed to denote seeking, attacking, or laying hold
of; e.g., לושׁן, lingua petere, i.e., to calumniate; עוין, oculo petere,
i.e., to envy.

[Isaiah 59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 59:14</span></span>

The confession of personal sins is followed by that of the sinful state
of society. "And right is forced back, and righteousness stands afar
off; for truth has fallen in the market-place, and honesty finds no
admission. And truth became missing, and he who avoids evil is
outlawed." In connection with mishpât and tsedâqâh here, we have not to
think of the manifestation of divine judgment and justice which is
prevented from being realized; but the people are here continuing the
confession of their own moral depravity. Right has been forced back from
the place which it ought to occupy (hissı̄g is the word applied in the
law to the removal of boundaries), and righteousness has to look from
afar off at the unjust habits of the people, without being able to
interpose. And why are right and righteousness - that united pair so
pleasing to God and beneficial to man - thrust out of the nation, and
why do they stand without? Because there is no truth or uprightness in
the nation. Truth wanders about, and stands no longer in the midst of
the nation; but upon the open street, the broad market-place, where
justice is administered, and where she ought above all to stand upright
and be preserved upright, she has stumbled and fallen down (cf., [Isa
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#008)); and honesty (nekhōchâh.md), which
goes straight forward, would gladly enter the limits of the forum, but
she cannot: people and judges alike form a barrier which keeps her back.
The consequence of this is indicated in [Isa
59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015.md): truth in its manifold practical
forms has become a missing thing; and whoever avoids the existing voice
is mishtōlēl (part. hithpoel, not hithpoal), one who is obliged to let
himself be plundered and stripped ([Psa
76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006).md), to be made a shōlâl ([Mic
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008).md), Arab. maslûb, with a passive
turn given to the reflective meaning, as in התחפּשׂ, to cause one's self
to be spied out = to disguise one's self, and as in the so-called niphal
tolerativum (Ewald, 133, b, 2).

The third strophe of the prophecy commences at [Isa
59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015.md) or [Isa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md). It begins with threatening, and
closes with promises; for the true nature of God is love, and every
manifestation of wrath is merely one phase in its development. In
consideration of the fact that this corrupt state of things furnishes no
prospect of self-improvement, Jehovah has already equipped Himself for
judicial interposition. "And Jehovah saw it, and it was displeasing in
His eyes, that there was no right. And He saw that there was not a man
anywhere, and was astonished that there was nowhere an intercessor: then
His arm brought Him help, and His righteousness became His stay. And He
put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and the helmet of salvation upon
His head; and put on garments of vengeance as armour, and clothed
Himself in zeal as in a cloak. According to the deeds, accordingly He
will repay: burning wrath to His adversaries, punishment to His foes;
the islands He will repay with chastisement." The prophet's language has
now toilsomely worked its way through the underwood of keen reproach, of
dark descriptions of character, and of mournful confession which has
brought up the apostasy of the great mass in all the blacker colours
before his mind, from the fact that the confession proceeds from those
who are ready for salvation. And now, having come to the description of
the approaching judgment, out of whose furnace the church of the future
is to spring, it rises again like a palm-tree that has been violently
hurled to the ground, and shakes its head as if restored to itself in
the transforming ether of the future. Jehovah saw, and it excited His
displeasure ("it was evil in His eyes," an antiquated phrase from the
Pentateuch, e.g., [Gen 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#010).md) to see
that right (which He loves, [Isa 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008.md);
[Psa 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028).md) had vanished form the life
of His nation. He saw that there was no man there, no man possessing
either the disposition or the power to stem this corruption (אישׁ as in
[Jer 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md), cf., [Sa1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#009.md); [Kg1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002.md), and the old Jewish saying, "Where
there is no man, I strive to be a man"). He was astonished (the sight of
such total depravity exciting in Him the highest degree of compassion
and displeasure) that there was no מפגּיע, i.e., no one to step in
between God and the people, and by his intercession to press this
disastrous condition of the people upon the attention of God (see [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md); no one to form a wall against
the coming ruin, and cover the rent with his body; no one to appease the
wrath, like Aaron ([Num 17:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#012).md) or
Phinehas ([Num 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#007).md).

What the fut. consec. affirms from ותּושׁע onwards, is not something to
come, but something past, as distinguished form the coming events
announced from [Isa 59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md) onwards.
Because the nation was so utterly and deeply corrupt, Jehovah had
quipped Himself for judicial interposition. The equipment was already
completed; only the taking of vengeance remained to be effected. Jehovah
saw no man at His side who was either able or willing to help Him to His
right in opposition to the prevailing abominations, or to support His
cause. Then His own arm became His help, and His righteousness His
support (cf., [Isa 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005).md); so that He
did not desist from the judgment to which He felt Himself impelled,
until He had procured the fullest satisfaction for the honour of His
holiness ([Isa 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#016).md). The armour which
Jehovah puts on is now described. According to the scriptural view,
Jehovah is never unclothed; but the free radiation of His own nature
shapes itself into a garment of light. Light is the robe He wears ([Psa
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002).md). When the prophet describes
this garment of light as changed into a suit of armour, this must be
understood in the same sense as when the apostle in Eph speaks of a
Christian's panoply. Just as there the separate pieces of armour
represent the manifold self-manifestations of the inward spiritual life
so here the pieces of Jehovah's armour stand for the manifold
self-manifestations of His holy nature, which consists of a mixture of
wrath and love. He does not arm Himself from any outward armoury; but
the armoury is His infinite wrath and His infinite love, and the might
in which He manifests Himself in such and such a way to His creatures is
His infinite will. He puts on righteousness as a coat of mail (שׁרין in
half pause, as in [Kg1 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#034.md) in full
pause, for שׁריון, ō passing into the broader a, as is generally the
case in יחפּץ, יחבשׁ; also in [Gen
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014.md), שׁכלתי; [Gen
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md), עז; [Gen
49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027), יטרף.md), so that His appearance
on every side is righteousness; and on His head He sets the helmet of
salvation: for the ultimate object for which He goes into the conflict
is the redemption of the oppressed, salvation as the fruit of the
victory gained by righteousness. And over the coat of mail He draws on
clothes of vengeance as a tabard (lxx περιβόλαιον), and wraps Himself in
zeal as in a war-cloak. The inexorable justice of God is compared to an
impenetrable brazen coat of mail; His joyful salvation, to a helmet
which glitters from afar; His vengeance, with its manifold inflictions
of punishment, to the clothes worn above the coat of mail; and His
wrathful zeal (קנאה from קנא), to be deep red) with the fiery-looking
chlamys. No weapon is mentioned, neither the sword nor bow; for His own
arm procures Him help, and this alone. But what will Jehovah do, when He
has armed Himself thus with justice and salvation, vengeance and zeal?
As [Isa 59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md) affirms, He will carry
out a severe and general retributive judgment. גּמוּל and גּמלה signify
accomplishment of (on gâmal, see at [Isa
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009).md) a ῥῆμα μέσον; גּמלות, which may
signify, according to the context, either manifestations of love or
manifestations of wrath, and either retribution as looked at from the
side of God, or forfeiture as regarded from the side of man, has the
latter meaning here, viz., the works of men and the double-sided gemūl,
i.e., repayment, and that in the infliction of punishment. כּעל, as if,
as on account of, signifies, according to its Semitic use, in the
measure (כּ) of that which is fitting (על); cf., [Isa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007.md), uti par est propter. It is
repeated with emphasis (like לכן in [Isa
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#006).md); the second stands without
rectum, as the correlate of the first. By the adversaries and enemies,
we naturally understand, after what goes before, the rebellious
Israelites. The prophet does not mention these, however, but "the
islands," that is to say, the heathen world. He hides the special
judgment upon Israel in the general judgment upon the nations. The very
same fate falls upon Israel, the salt of the world which has lost its
savour, as upon the whole of the ungodly world. The purified church will
have its place in the midst of a world out of which the crying injustice
has been swept away.

[Isaiah 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 59:19</span></span>

The prophet now proceeds to depict the ישׁוּעה, the symbol of which is
the helmet upon Jehovah's head. "And they will fear the name of Jehovah
from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun: for He will
come like a stream dammed up, which a tempest of Jehovah drives away.
And a Redeemer comes for Zion, and for those who turn from apostasy in
Jacob, saith Jehovah." Instead of ויראוּ, Knobel would strike out the
metheg, and read ויראוּ, "and they will see;" but "seeing the name of
Jehovah" (the usual expression is "seeing His glory") is a phrase that
cannot be met with, though it is certainly a passable one; and the
relation in which [Isa 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md) stands to
[Isa 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md) does not recommend the
alteration, since [Isa 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md)
attributes that general fear of the name of Jehovah (cf., [Deu
28:58](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#058).md) and of His glory (see the
parallel overlooked by Knobel, [Psa
102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016).md), which follows the
manifestation of judgment on the part of Jehovah, to the manner in which
this manifestation occurs. Moreover, the true Masoretic reading in this
passage is not ויראו (as in [Mic
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#017)), but וייראו (see Norzi.md). The two
מן in ממּערב (with the indispensable metheg before the chateph, and a
second to ensure clearness of pronunciation)

(Note: See the law in Br's Metheg-Setzung, 29.)

and וּממּזרח־שׁמשׁ (also with the so-called strong metheg)

(Note: See idem, 28.)

indicate the terminus a quo. From all quarters of the globe will fear of
the name and of the glory of Jehovah become naturalized among the
nations of the world. For when God has withdrawn His name and His glory
from the world's history, as during the Babylonian captivity (and also
at the present time), the return of both is all the more intense and
extraordinary; and this is represented here in a figure which recals
[Isa 30:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md); [Isa
10:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md) (cf., [Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002).md). The accentuation, which gives
pashta to כנּהר, does indeed appear to make צר the subject, either in
the sense of oppressor or adversary, as in [Lam
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md), or in that of oppression, as in
[Isa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md); [Isa
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md); [Isa
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#020.md). The former is quite out of the
question, since no such transition to a human instrument of the
retributive judgment could well take place after the לצריו חמה in [Isa
59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md). In support of the latter, it
would be possible to quote [Isa 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018.md)
and [Isa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012.md), since צר is the
antithesis to shâlōm. But according to such parallels as [Isa
30:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md), it is incomparably more
natural to take Jehovah (His name, His glory) as the subject. Moreover,
בּו, which must in any case refer to כנהר, is opposed to the idea that
צר is the subject, to which בו would have the most natural claim to be
referred - an explanation indeed which Stier and Hahn have really tried,
taking נוססח as in [Psa 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004.md), and
rendering it "The Spirit of Jehovah holds up a banner against him, viz.,
the enemy." If, however, Jehovah is the subject to יבא, צר כנּהר must be
taken together (like מכסּים ... כּמּים, [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md); טובה רוּחך, [Psa
143:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#010); Ges. 111, 2, b.md), either in the
sense of "a hemming stream," one causing as it were a state of siege
(from tsūr, [Isa 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002.md); [Isa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003).md), or, better still, according to
the adjective use of the noun צר (here with tzakeph, צר from צרר) in
[Isa 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#020.md); [Job
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#007.md); [Kg2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001.md), a closely confined stream, to
whose waters the banks form a compressing dam, which it bursts through
when agitated by a tempest, carrying everything away with it.

Accordingly, the explanation we adopt is this: Jehovah will come like
the stream, a stream hemmed in, which a wind of Jehovah, i.e., (like
"the mountains of God," "cedars of God," "garden of Jehovah," [Isa
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003.md), cf., [Num
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#006).md) a strong tempestuous wind,
sweeps away (בּו נססה, nōsesa-b-bô, with the tone drawn back and dagesh
forte conj. in the monosyllable, the pilel of nūs with Beth: to hunt
into, to press upon and put to flight) - a figure which also indicates
that the Spirit of Jehovah is the driving force in this His judicially
gracious revelation of Himself. Then, when the name of Jehovah makes
itself legible once more as with letters of fire, when His glory comes
like a sea of fire within the horizon of the world's history, all the
world form west to east, from east to west, will begin to fear Him. But
the true object of the love, which bursts forth through this revelation
of wrath, is His church, which includes not only those who have retained
their faith, but all who have been truly converted to Him. And He comes
(וּבא) a continuation of יבא) for Zion a Redeemer, i.e., as a Redeemer
(a closer definition of the predicate), and for those who turn away from
apostasy (פשׁע שׁבי, compare [Isa
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#027.md), and for the genitive connection
[Mic 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008.md), מלחמה שׁוּבי, those who have
turned away form the war). The Vav here does not signify "and indeed,"
as in [Isa 57:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018.md), but "more
especially." He comes as a Redeemer for Zion, i.e., His church which has
remained true, including those who turn again to Jehovah from their
previous apostasy. In [Rom 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md) the
apostle quotes this word of God, which is sealed with "Thus saith
Jehovah," as a proof of the final restoration of all Israel; for יהוה
(according to the Apocalypse, ὁ ὤν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος) is to him
the God who moves on through the Old Testament towards the goal of His
incarnation, and through the New Testament towards that of His parousia
in Christ, which will bring the world's history to a close. But this
final close does not take place without its having become apparent at
the same time that God "has concluded all in unbelief that He may have
compassion upon all" ([Rom 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#032).md).

[Isaiah 59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 59:21</span></span>

Jehovah, having thus come as a Redeemer to His people, who have hitherto
been lying under the curse, makes an everlasting covenant with them.
"And I, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: My Spirit which is
upon thee, and my word which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart
out of thy mouth, and out of the mouth of thy seed, and out of the mouth
of thy seed's seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever." In the
words, "And I, this is my covenant with them," we have a renewal of the
words of God to Abram in [Gen 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004.md),
"As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee." Instead of אתּם we have
in the same sense אתם (not אותם, as in [Isa
54:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#015).md); we find this very frequently
in Jeremiah. The following prophecy is addressed to Israel, the "servant
of Jehovah," which has been hitherto partially faithful and partially
unfaithful, but which has now returned to fidelity, viz., the "remnant
of Israel," which has been rescued through the medium of a general
judgment upon the nations, and to which the great body of all who fear
God from east to west attach themselves. This church of the new covenant
has the Spirit of God over it, for it comes down upon it from above; and
the comforting saving words of God are not only the blessed treasure of
its heart, but the confession of its mouth which spreads salvation all
around. The words intended are those which prove, according to [Isa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016.md), the seeds of the new heaven and
the new earth. The church of the last days, endowed with the Spirit of
God, and never again forsaking its calling, carries them as the
evangelist of God in her apostolic mouth. The subject of the following
prophecy is the new Jerusalem, the glorious centre of this holy church.
