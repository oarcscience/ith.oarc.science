### [Exodus Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 40:1</span></span>

After the completion of all the works, the command was given by God to
Moses to set up the dwelling of the tabernacle on the first day of the
first month (see at [Exo 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001).md), sc.,
in the second year of the Exodus (see [Exo
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017).md), and to put all the vessels,
both of the dwelling and court, in the places appointed by God; also to
furnish the table of shew-bread with its fitting out (ערכּו = לחם ערך
[Exo 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#023).md), i.e., to arrange the
bread upon it in the manner prescribed ([Exo
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#004.md) cf. [Lev
24:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#006).md), and to put water in the laver
of the court ([Exo 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#007).md). After that
he was to anoint the dwelling and everything in it, also the altar of
burnt-offering and laver, with the anointing oil, and to sanctify them
([Exo 40:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009).md); and to consecrate
Aaron and his sons before the door of the tabernacle, and clothe them,
anoint them, and sanctify them as priests ([Exo
40:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#012).md). When we read here, however,
that the dwelling and the vessels therein would be rendered "holy"
through the anointing, but the altar of burnt-offering "most holy," we
are not to understand this as attributing a higher degree of holiness to
the altar of burnt-offering than to the dwelling and its furniture; but
the former is called "most holy" merely in the sense ascribed to it in
[Exo 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010.md) namely, that every one who
touched it was to become holy; in other words, the distinction has
reference to the fact, that, standing as it did in the court, it was
more exposed to contact from the people than the vessels in the
dwelling, which no layman was allowed to enter. In this relative sense
we find the same statement in [Exo
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#029.md), with reference to the
tabernacle and all the vessels therein, the dwelling as well as the
court, that they would become most holy in consequence of the anointing
(see the remarks on [Exo 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010).md). It is
stated provisionally, in [Exo 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#016.md),
that this command was fulfilled by Moses. But from the further history
we find that the consecration of the priests did not take place
contemporaneously with the erection of the tabernacle, but somewhat
later, or not till after the promulgation of the laws of sacrifice (cf.
Lev 8 and [Lev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)..md).

[Exodus 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 40:17</span></span>

On the day mentioned in [Exo 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002.md) the
dwelling and court were erected. As not quite nine months had elapsed
between the arrival of the Israelites at Sinai, in the third month after
the Exodus ([Exo 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001).md), and the first
day of the second year, when the work was finished and handed over to
Moses, the building, and all the work connected with it, had not
occupied quite half a year; as we have to deduct from the nine months
(or somewhat less) not only the eighty days which Moses spent upon Sinai
([Exo 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#018.md); [Exo
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028).md), but the days of preparation
for the giving of the law and conclusion of the covenant (Ex
19:1-24:11), and the interval between the first and second stay that
Moses made upon the mountain (ch. 32 and 33). The erection of the
dwelling commenced with the fixing of the sockets, into which the boards
were placed and fastened with their bolts, and the setting up of the
pillars for the curtains ([Exo 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#018).md).
"He (Moses) then spread the tent over the dwelling, and laid the
covering of the tent upon the top." By the "covering of the tent" we are
to understand the two coverings, made of red rams' skins and the skins
of the sea-cow ([Exo 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014).md). In
analogy with this, את־האלל פּרשׂ denotes not only the roofing with the
goats' hair, but the spreading out of the inner cloth of mixed colours
upon the wooden frame-work.

[Exodus 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 40:20</span></span>

Arrangement of the ark. "He took and put the testimony into the ark."
העדוּת does not mean "the revelation, so far as it existed already,
viz., with regard to the erection of the sanctuary and institution of
the priesthood (ch. 25-31), and so forth," as Knobel arbitrarily
supposes, but "the testimony," i.e., the decalogue written upon the two
tables of stone, or the tables of the covenant with the ten words; "the
testimony," therefore, is an abbreviated expression for "the tables of
testimony" ([Exo 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018.md), see at [Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016).md). After the ark had been brought
into the dwelling, he "hung the curtain" (vail, see at [Exo
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md); lit., placed it upon the hooks
of the pillars), "and so covered over the ark of the testimony," since
the ark, when placed in the back part of the dwelling, was covered or
concealed from persons entering the dwelling or the holy place.

[Exodus 40:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 40:22</span></span>

Arrangement of the front room of the dwelling. The table was placed on
the right side, towards the north, and the shew-bread was laid upon it.
לחם ערך does not signify "a row of bread," but the "position or placing
of bread;" for, according to [Lev
24:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#006.md), the twelve loaves of
shew-bread were placed upon the table in two rows, corresponding to the
size of the tables (two cubits long and one cubit broad). The
candlestick was placed upon the left side, opposite to the table, and
the golden altar in front of the curtain, i.e., midway between the two
sides, but near the curtain in front of the most holy place (see at [Exo
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006).md). After these things had been
placed, the curtain was hung in the door of the dwelling.

[Exodus 40:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 40:29</span></span>

The altar of burnt-offering was then placed "before the door of the
dwelling of the tabernacle," and the laver "between the tabernacle and
the altar," from which it is evident that the altar was not placed close
to the entrance to the dwelling, but at some distance off, though in a
straight line with the door. The laver, which stood between the altar
and the entrance to the dwelling, was probably placed more to the side;
so that when the priests washed their hands and feet, before entering
the dwelling or approaching the altar, there was no necessity for them
to go round the altar, or to pass close by it, in order to get to the
laver. Last of all the court was erected round about the dwelling and
the altar, by the setting up of the pillars, which enclosed the space
round the dwelling and the altar with their drapery, and the hanging up
of the curtain at the entrance to the court. There is no allusion to the
anointing of these holy places and things, as commanded in [Exo
40:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009.md), in the account of their
erection; for this did not take place till afterwards, viz., at the
consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests ([Lev
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010).md). It is stated, however, on
the other hand, that as the vessels were arranged, Moses laid out the
shew-bread upon the table ([Exo
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#023).md), burned sweet incense upon the
golden altar ([Exo 40:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#027).md), and offered
"the burnt-offering and meat-offering," i.e., the daily morning and
evening sacrifice, upon the altar of burnt-offering ([Exo
29:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038).md). Consequently the
sacrificial service was performed upon them before they had been
anointed. Although this may appear surprising, there is no ground for
rejecting a conclusion, which follows so naturally from the words of the
text. The tabernacle and its furniture were not made holy things for the
first time by the anointing; this simply sanctified them for the use of
the nation, i.e., for the service which the priests were to perform in
connection with them on behalf of the congregation (see at [Lev
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010).md). They were made holy things
and holy vessels by the fact that they were built, prepared, and set up,
according to the instructions given by Jehovah; and still more by the
fact, that after the tabernacle had been erected as a dwelling, the
"glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle" ([Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034).md). But the glory of the Lord
entered the dwelling before the consecration of the priests, and the
accompanying anointing of the tabernacle and its vessels; for, according
to [Lev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)., it was from the
tabernacle that Jehovah spake to Moses, when He gave him the laws of
sacrifice, which were promulgated before the consecration of the
priests, and were carried out in connection with it. But when the glory
of the Lord had found a dwelling-place in the tabernacle, Moses was not
required to offer continually the sacrifice prescribed for every morning
and evening, and by means of this sacrifice to place the congregation in
spiritual fellowship with its God, until Aaron and his sons had been
consecrated for this service.

[Exodus 40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 40:34</span></span>

When the sanctuary, that had been built for the Lord for a dwelling in
Israel, had been set up with all its apparatus, "the cloud covering the
tabernacle, and the glory of Jehovah filled the dwelling," so that Moses
was unable to enter. The cloud, in which Jehovah had hitherto been
present with His people, and guided and protected them upon their
journeying (see at [Exo 13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021).md), now
came down upon the tabernacle and filled the dwelling with the gracious
presence of the Lord. So long as this cloud rested upon the tabernacle
the children of Israel remained encamped; but when it ascended, they
broke up the encampment to proceed onwards. This sign was Jehovah's
command for encamping or going forward "throughout all their journeys"
([Exo 40:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#036).md). This statement is
repeated still more elaborately in [Num
9:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015.md). The mode in which the glory
of Jehovah filled the dwelling, or in which Jehovah manifested His
presence within it, is not described; but the glory of Jehovah filling
the dwelling is clearly distinguished from the cloud coming down upon
the tabernacle. It is obvious, however, from [Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md), and [Kg1
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md), that in the dwelling the
glory of God was also manifested in a cloud. At the dedication of the
temple ([Kg1 8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010).md) the expression
"the cloud filled the house of Jehovah" is used interchangeably with
"the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah." To consecrate the
sanctuary, which had been finished and erected as His dwelling, and to
give to the people a visible proof that He had chosen it for His
dwelling, Jehovah filled the dwelling in both its parts with the cloud
which shadowed forth His presence, so that Moses was unable to enter it.
This cloud afterwards drew back into the most holy place, to dwell
there, above the outspread wings of the cherubim of the ark of the
covenant; so that Moses and (at a later period) the priests were able to
enter the holy place and perform the required service there, without
seeing the sign of the gracious presence of God, which was hidden by the
curtain of the most holy place. So long as the Israelites were on their
journey to Canaan, the presence of Jehovah was manifested outwardly and
visibly by the cloud, which settled upon the ark, and rose up from it
when they were to travel onward.

With the completion of this building and its divine consecration, Israel
had now received a real pledge of the permanence of the covenant of
grace, which Jehovah had concluded with it; a sanctuary which perfectly
corresponded to the existing circumstances of its religious development,
and kept constantly before it the end of its calling from God. For
although God dwelt in the tabernacle in the midst of His people, and the
Israelites might appear before Him, to pray for and receive the covenant
blessings that were promised them, they were still forbidden to go
directly to God's throne of grace. The barrier, which sin had erected
between the holy God and the unholy nation, was not yet taken away. To
this end the law was given, which could only increase their
consciousness of sin and unworthiness before God. But as this barrier
had already been broken through by the promise of the Lord, that He
would meet the people in His glory before the door of the tabernacle at
the altar of burnt-offering ([Exo
29:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#042).md); so the entrance of the
chosen people into the dwelling of God was effected mediatorially by the
service of the sanctified priests in the holy place, which also
prefigured their eventual reception into the house of the Lord. And even
the curtain, which still hid the glory of God from the chosen priests
and sanctified mediators of the nation, was to be lifted at least once a
year by the anointed priest, who had been called by God to be the
representative of the whole congregation. On the day of atonement the
high priest was to sprinkle the blood of atonement in front of the
throne of grace, to make expiation for the children of Israel because of
all their sin (Lev 16), and to prefigure the perfect atonement through
the blood of the eternal Mediator, through which the way to the throne
of grace is opened to all believers, that they may go into the house of
God and abide there for ever, and for ever see God.
