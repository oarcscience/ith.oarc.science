### [Hosea Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 10:1</span></span>

In a fresh turn the concluding thought of the last strophe ([Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010).md) is resumed, and the guilt and
punishment of Israel still more fully described in two sections, [Hos
10:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md) and [Hos
10:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009.md). [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md). "Israel is a running vine; it
set fruit for itself: the more of its fruit, the more altars did it
prepare; the better its land, the better pillars did they make. [Hos
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#002.md). Smooth was their heart, ow will
they atone. He will break in pieces their altars, desolate their
pillars. [Hos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#003.md). Yea, now will they
say, No king to us! for we feared not Jehovah; and the king, what shall
he do to us?" Under the figure of a vine running luxuriantly, which did
indeed set some good fruit, but bore no sound ripe grapes, the prophet
describes Israel as a glorious plantation of God Himself, which did not
answer the expectations of its Creator. The figure is simply sketched in
a few bold lines. We have an explanatory parallel in [Psa
80:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md). The participle bōqēq does not
mean "empty" or "emptying out" here; for this does not suit the next
clause, according to which the fruit was set, but from the primary
meaning of bâqaq, to pour out, pouring itself out, overflowing, i.e.,
running luxuriantly. It has the same meaning, therefore, as ג סרחת in
[Eze 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#006.md), that which extends its
branches far and wide, that is to say, grows most vigorously. The next
sentence, "it set fruit," still belongs to the figure; but in the third
sentence the figure passes over into a literal prophecy. According to
the abundance of its fruit, Israel made many altars; and in proportion
to the goodness of its land, it made better מצּבות, Baal's pillars (see
at [Kg1 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023).md); i.e., as Israel
multiplied, and under the blessing of God attained to prosperity,
wealth, and power in the good land ([Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008).md), it forgot its God, and fell more
and more into idolatry (cf. [Hos 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#010.md);
[Hos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md), [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011).md). The reason of all this was,
that their heart was smooth, i.e., dissimulating, not sincerely devoted
to the Lord, inasmuch as, under the appearance of devotedness to God,
they still clung to idols (for the fact, see [Kg2
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009).md). The word châlâq, to be smooth,
was mostly applied by a Hebrew to the tongue, lip, mouth, throat, and
speech ([Psa 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010.md); [Psa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#003.md); [Psa
55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022.md); [Pro
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003).md), and not to the heart. But in
[Eze 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#024.md) we read of smooth, i.e.,
deceitful prophesying; and there is all the more reason for retaining
the meaning "smooth" here, that the rendering "their heart is divided,"
which is supported by the ancient versions, cannot be grammatically
defended. For châlâq is not used in kal in an intransitive sense; and
the active rendering, "He (i.e., God) has divided their heart" (Hitzig),
gives an unscriptural thought. They will now atone for this, for God
will destroy their altars and pillars. ערף, "to break the neck of the
altars," is a bold expression, applied to the destruction of the altars
by breaking off the horns (compare [Amo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#014).md). Then will the people see and be
compelled to confess that it has no longer a king, because it has not
feared the Lord, since the king who has been set up in opposition to the
will of the Lord ([Hos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004).md) cannot
bring either help or deliverance ([Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010).md). עשׂה, to do, i.e., to help or
be of use to a person (cf. [Ecc 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002).md).

[Hosea 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 10:4</span></span>

The thoughts of [Hos 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#002.md), [Hos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#003.md) are carried out still further in
[Hos 10:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md). [Hos
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md). "They have spoken words, sworn
falsely, made treaties: thus right springs up like darnel in the furrows
of the field. [Hos 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md). For the
calves of Beth-aven the inhabitants of Samaria were afraid: yea, its
people mourn over it, and its sacred ministers will tremble at it, at
its glory, because it has strayed from them. [Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006.md). Men will also carry it to
Asshur, as a present for king Jareb: shame will seize upon Ephraim, and
Israel will be put to shame for its counsel." The dissimulation of heart
([Hos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#003).md) manifested itself in their
speaking words which were nothing but words, i.e., in vain talk (cf.
[Isa 58:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013).md), in false swearing, and in
the making of treaties. אלות, by virtue of the parallelism, is an infin.
abs. for אלה, formed like כּרת, analogous to שׁתות ([Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013); see Ewald, 240, b.md). כּרת בּרית,
in connection with false swearing, must signify the making of a covenant
without any truthfulness in it, i.e., the conclusion of treaties with
foreign nations - for example, with Assyria - which they were inclined
to observe only so long as they could promise themselves advantages from
them. In consequence of this, right has become like a bitter plant
growing luxuriantly (ראשׁ = רושׁ; see at [Deu
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#017).md). Mishpât does not mean judgment
here, or the punitive judgment of God (Chald. and many others), for this
could hardly be compared with propriety to weeds running over
everything, but right in its degeneracy into wrong, or right that men
have turned into bitter fruit or poison ([Amo
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012).md). This spreads about in the
kingdom, as weeds spread luxuriantly in the furrows of the field (שׂדי a
poetical form for שׂדה, like [Deu
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013.md); [Psa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#008).md). Therefore the judgment cannot be
delayed, and is already approaching in so threatening a manner, that the
inhabitants of Samaria tremble for the golden calves. The plural ‛eglōth
is used with indefinite generality, and gives no warrant, therefore, for
the inference that there were several golden calves set up in Bethel.
Moreover, this would be at variance with the fact, that in the sentences
which follow we find "the (one) calf" spoken of. The feminine form
‛eglōth, which only occurs here, is also probably connected with the
abstract use of the plural, inasmuch as the feminine is the proper form
for abstracts. Bēth-'âven for Bēth-'ēl, as in [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md). Shâkhēn is construed with the
plural, as an adjective used in a collective sense. כּי ([Hos
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005).md) is emphatic, and the suffixes
attached to עמּו and כּמריו do not refer to Samaria, but to the idol,
i.e., the calf, since the prophet distinctly calls Israel, which ought
to have been the nation of Jehovah, the nation of its calf-idol, which
mourned with its priests (kemârı̄m, the priests appointed in connection
with the worship of the calves: see at [Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005).md) for the carrying away of the
calf to Assyria. גּיל does not mean to exult or rejoice here, nor to
tremble (applied to the leaping of the heart from fear, as it does from
joy), but has the same meaning as חיל in [Psa
96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009.md). עליו is still further defined by
על־כּבודו, "for its glory," i.e., not for the temple-treasure at Bethel
(Hitzig), nor the one glorious image of the calf, as the symbol of the
state-god (Ewald, Umbreit), but the calf, to which the people attributed
the glory of the true God. The perfect, gâlâh, is used prophetically of
that which was as good as complete and certain (for the fut. exact., cf.
Ewald, 343, a). The golden calf, the glory of the nation, will have to
wander into exile. This cannot even save itself; it will be taken to
Assyria, to king Jareb (see at [Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013).md), as minchâh, a present of
tribute (see [Sa2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md), [Sa2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006.md); [Kg1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001).md). For the construing of the
passive with את, see Ges. 143, 1, a. Then will Ephraim (= Israel) be
seized by reproach and shame. Boshnâh, a word only met with here; it is
formed from the masculine bōshen, which is not used at all (see Ewald,
163, 164).

[Hosea 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 10:7</span></span>

With the carrying away of the golden calf the kingdom of Samaria also
perishes, and desert plants will grow upon the places of idols. [Hos
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#007.md), [Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008.md). "Destroyed is Samaria; her king
like a splinter on the surface of the water. And destroyed are the high
places of Aven, the sin of Israel: thorn and thistle will rise up on
their altars; and they will speak to the mountains, Cover us! and to the
hills, Fall on us!" שׁמרון מלכּהּ is not an asyndeton, "Samaria and its
king;" but Shōmerōn is to be taken absolutely, "as for Samaria,"
although, as a matter of fact, not only Samaria, the capital of the
kingdom, but the kingdom itself, was destroyed. For malkâh does not
refer to any particular king, but is used in a general sense for "the
king that Samaria had," so that the destruction of the monarchy is here
predicted (cf. [Hos 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015).md). The idea
that the words refer to one particular king, is not only at variance
with the context, which contains no allusion to any one historical
occurrence, but does not suit the simile: like a splinter upon the
surface of the water, which is carried away by the current, and vanishes
without leaving a trace behind. Qetseph is not "foam" (Chald., Symm.,
Rabb.), but a broken branch, a fagot or a splinter, as qetsâphâh in [Joe
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#007.md) clearly shows. Bâmōth 'âven are
the buildings connected with the image-worship at Bethel ('âven =
Bēth-'ēl, [Hos 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005).md), the temple
erected there (bēth bâmōth), together with the altar, possibly also
including other illegal places of sacrifice there, which constituted the
chief sin of the kingdom of Israel. These were to be so utterly
destroyed, that thorns and thistles would grow upon the ruined altars
(cf. [Gen 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018).md). "The sign of extreme
solitude, that there are not even the walls left, or any traces of the
buildings" (Jerome). When the kingdom shall be thus broken up, together
with the monarchy and the sacred places, the inhabitants, in their
hopeless despair, will long for swift death and destruction. Saying to
the mountains, "Cover us," etc., implies much more than hiding
themselves in the holes and clefts of the rocks ([Isa
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019.md), [Isa
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#021).md). It expresses the desire to be
buried under the falling mountains and hills, that they may no longer
have to bear the pains and terrors of the judgment. In this sense are
the words transferred by Christ, in [Luk
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#030.md), to the calamities attending the
destruction of Jerusalem, and in [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md) to the terrors of the last
judgment.

[Hosea 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 10:9</span></span>

After the threatening of punishment has thus been extended in [Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008.md), even to the utter ruin of the
kingdom, the prophet returns in [Hos
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009.md) to the earlier times, for the
purpose of exhibiting in a new form and deeply rooted sinfulness of the
people, and then, under cover of an appeal to them to return to
righteousness, depicting still further the time of visitation, and (in
[Hos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md), [Hos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015).md) predicting with still greater
clearness the destruction of the kingdom and the overthrow of the
monarchy. [Hos 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009.md). "Since the days
of Gibeah hast thou sinned, O Israel: there have they remained: the war
against the sons of wickedness did not overtake them at Gibeah. [Hos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#010.md). According to my desire shall I
chastise them; and nations will be gathered together against them, to
bind them to their two transgressions." Just as in [Hos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009.md), the days of Gibeah, i.e., the
days when that ruthless crime was committed at Gibeah upon the concubine
of the Levite, are mentioned as a time of deep corruption; so are those
days described in the present passage as the commencement of Israel's
sin. For it is as obvious that מיממי is not to be understood in a
comparative sense, as it is that the days of Gibeah are not to be taken
as referring to the choice of Saul, who sprang from Gibeah, to be their
king (Chald.). The following words, שׁם עמדוּ גגו, which are very
difficult, and have been variously explained, do not describe the
conduct of Israel in those days; for, in the first place, the statement
that the war did not overtake them is by no means in harmony with this,
since the other tribes avenged that crime so severely that the tribe of
Benjamin was almost exterminated; and secondly, the suffix attached to
תּשּׂיגם evidently refers to the same persons as that appended to אסּ'רם
in [Hos 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md), i.e., to the Israelites
of the ten tribes, to which Hosea foretels the coming judgment. These
are therefore the subject to עמדוּ, and consequently עמד signifies to
stand, to remain, to persevere (cf. [Isa
47:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#012.md); [Jer
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#014).md). There, in Gibeah, did they
remain, that is to say, they persevered in the sin of Gibeah, without
the war at Gibeah against the sinners overtaking them (the imperfect, in
a subordinated clause, used to describe the necessary consequence; and
עלוה transposed from עולה mo, like זעוה in [Deu
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025) for זועה.md). The meaning is, that
since the days of Gibeah the Israelites persist in the same sin as the
Gibeahites; but whereas those sinners were punished and destroyed by the
war, the ten tribes still live on in the same sin without having been
destroyed by any similar war. Jehovah will now chastise them for it.
בּאוּתי, in my desire, equivalent to according to my wish - an
anthropomorphic description of the severity of the chastisement. ואסּ'רם
from יסר (according to Ewald, 139, a), with the Vav of the apodosis. The
chastisement will consist in the fact, that nations will be gathered
together against Israel בּאסרם, lit., at their binding, i.e., when I
shall bind them. The chethib עינתם cannot well be the plural of עין,
because the plural עינות is not used for the eyes; and the rendering,
"before their two eyes," in the sense of "without their being able to
prevent it" (Ewald), yields the unheard-of conception of binding a
person before his own eyes; and, moreover, the use of שׁתּי עינות
instead of the simple dual would still be left unexplained. We must
therefore give the preference to the keri עונת, and regard the chethib
as another form, that may be accounted for from the transition of the
verbs עי into עו, and עונת as a contraction of עונת, since עונה cannot
be shown to have either the meaning of "sorrow" (Chald., A. E.), or that
of the severe labour of "tributary service." And, moreover, neither of
these meanings would give us a suitable thought; whilst the very same
objection may be brought against the supposition that the doubleness of
the work refers to Ephraim and Judah, which has been brought against the
rendering "to bind to his furrows," viz., that it would be non solum
ineptum, sed locutionis monstrum. לשׁתּי עונתם, "to their two
transgression" to bind them: i.e., to place them in connection with the
transgressions by the punishment, so that they will be obliged to drag
them along like beasts of burden. By the two transgressions we are to
understand neither the two golden calves at Bethel and Daniel (Hitzig),
nor unfaithfulness towards Jehovah and devotedness to idols, after [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013) (Cyr., Theod..md); but their
apostasy from Jehovah and the royal house of David, in accordance with
[Hos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md), where it is distinctly
stated that the ultimate conversion of the nation will consist in its
seeking Jehovah and David their king.

[Hosea 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 10:11</span></span>

In the next verse the punishment is still further defined, and also
extended to Judah. [Hos 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md). "And
Ephraim is an instructed cow, which loves to thresh; and I, I have come
over the beauty of her neck: I yoke Ephraim; Judah will plough, Jacob
harrow itself." Melummâdâh, instructed, trained to work, received its
more precise definition from the words "loving to thresh" ('ōhabhtı̄, a
participle with the connecting Yod in the constructive: see Ewald, 211,
b), not as being easier work in comparison with the hard task of
driving, ploughing, and harrowing, but because in threshing the ox was
allowed to eat at pleasure ([Deu
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004).md), from which Israel became fat
and strong ([Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015).md). Threshing,
therefore, is a figurative representation not of the conquest of other
nations (as in [Mic 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013.md); [Isa
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015).md), but of pleasant, productive,
profitable labour. Israel had accustomed itself to this, from the fact
that God had bestowed His blessing upon it ([Hos
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#006).md). But it would be different now.
עברתּי על, a prophetic perfect: I come over the neck, used in a hostile
sense, and answering to our "rushing in upon a person." The actual idea
is that of putting a heavy yoke upon the neck, not of putting a rider
upon it. ארכּיב not to mount or ride, but to drive, or use for drawing
and driving, i.e., to harness, and that, as the following clauses show,
to the plough and harrow, for the performance of hard field-labour,
which figuratively represents subjugation and bondage. Judah is also
mentioned here again, as in [Hos 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md);
[Hos 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md), etc. Jacob, in connection
with Judah, is not a name for the whole nation (or the twelve tribes),
but is synonymous with Ephraim, i.e., Israel of the ten tribes. This is
required by the correspondence between the last two clauses, which are
simply a further development of the expression ארכיב אף, with an
extension of the punishment threatened against Ephraim to Judah also.

[Hosea 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 10:12</span></span>

The call to repentance and reformation of life is then appended in [Hos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md), [Hos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013.md), clothed in similar figures.
[Hos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md). "Sow to yourselves for
righteousness, reap according to love; plough for yourselves virgin
soil: for it is time to seek Jehovah, till He come and rain
righteousness upon you. [Hos 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013.md). Ye
have ploughed wickedness, ye have reaped crime: eaten the fruit of
lying: because thou hast trusted in thy way, in the multitude of thy
mighty men." Sowing and reaping are figures used to denote their
spiritual and moral conduct. לצדקה, for righteousness, is parallel to
לפי חסד; i.e., sow that righteousness may be able to spring up like
seed, i.e., righteousness towards your fellow-men. The fruit of this
will be chesed, condescending love towards the poor and wretched. Nı̄r
nı̄r, both here and in [Jer 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003.md) to
plough virgin soil, i.e., to make land not yet cultivated arable. We
have an advance in this figure: they are to give up all their previous
course of conduct, and create for themselves a new sphere for their
activity, i.e., commence a new course of life. ועת, and indeed it is
time, equivalent to, for it is high time to give up your old sinful says
and seek the Lord, till (עד) He come, i.e., till He turn His grace to
you again, and cause it to rain upon you. Tsedeq, righteousness, not
salvation, a meaning which the word never has, and least of all here,
where tsedeq corresponds to the tsedâqâh of the first clause. God causes
righteousness to rain, inasmuch as He not only gives strength to secure
it, like rain for the growth of the seed (cf. [Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003).md), but must also generate and
create it in man by His Spirit ([Psa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012).md). The reason for this summons is
given in [Hos 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013.md), in another
allusion to the moral conduct of Israel until now. Hitherto they have
ploughed as well as reaped unrighteousness and sin, and eaten lies as
the fruit thereof, - lies, inasmuch as they did not promote the
prosperity of the kingdom as they imagined, but only led to its decay
and ruin. For they did not trust in Jehovah the Creator and rock of
salvation, but in their way, i.e., their deeds and their might, in the
strength of their army ([Amo 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013).md),
the worthlessness of which they will now discover.

[Hosea 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 10:14</span></span>

"And tumult will arise against thy peoples, and all thy fortifications
are laid waste, as Shalman laid Beth-Arbeel waste in the day of the war:
mother and children are dashed to pieces. [Hos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015.md). Thus hath Bethel done to you
because of the wickedness of your wickedness: in the morning dawn the
king of Israel is cut off, cut off." קאם with א as mater lect. (Ewald,
15, e), construed with ב: to rise up against a person, as in [Psa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md); [Job
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#008.md). שׁאון, war, tumult, as in [Amo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002.md). בּעמּיך: against thy people of
war. The expression is chosen with a reference to rōbh gibbōrı̄m (the
multitude of mighty men), in which Israel put its trust. The meaning,
countrymen, or tribes, is restricted to the older language of the
Pentateuch. The singular יוּשּׁד refers to כּל, as in [Isa
64:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#010.md), contrary to the ordinary
language (cf. Ewald, 317, c). Nothing is known concerning the
devastation of Beth-Arbeel by Shalman; and hence there has always been
great uncertainty as to the meaning of the words. Shalman is no doubt a
contracted form of Shalmanezer, the king of Assyria, who destroyed the
kingdom of the ten tribes ([Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006).md).
Bēth-'arbē'l is hardly Arbela of Assyria, which became celebrated
through the victory of Alexander (Strab. [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md), [Isa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#003).md), since the Israelites could
scarcely have become so well acquainted with such a remote city, as that
the prophet could hold up the desolation that befel it as an example to
them, but in all probability the Arbela in Galilaea Superior, which is
mentioned in 1 Maccabees 9:2, and very frequently in Josephus, a place
in the tribe of Naphtali, between Sephoris and Tiberias (according to
Robinson, Pal. iii. pp. 281-2, and Bibl. Researches, p. 343: the modern
Irbid). The objection offered by Hitzig, - viz. that shōd is a noun in
[Hos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md); [Hos
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#013.md); [Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md), and that the infinitive
construct, with ל prefixed, is written לשׁדד in [Jer
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004.md); and lastly, that if Shalman were
the subject, we should expect the preposition את before בּית, - is not
conclusive, and the attempt which he makes to explain Salman-Beth-Arbel
from the Sanscrit is not worth mentioning. The clause "mother and
children," etc., a proverbial expression denoting inhuman cruelty (see
at [Gen 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012).md), does not merely refer
to the conduct of Shalman in connection with Beth-arbel, possibly in the
campaign mentioned in [Kg2 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003.md), but
is also intended to indicate the fate with which the whole of the
kingdom of Israel was threatened. In [Kg2
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016.md) this threat concludes with an
announcement of the overthrow of the monarchy, accompanied by another
allusion to the guilt of the people. The subject to כּכה עשׂה is Beth-el
(Chald.), not Shalman or Jehovah. Bethel, the seat of the idolatry,
prepares this lot for the people on account of its great wickedness.
עשׂה is a perf. proph.' and רעת רעתכם, wickedness in its second potency,
extreme wickedness (cf. Ewald, 313, c). Basshachar, in the morning-dawn,
i.e., at the time when prosperity is once more apparently about to dawn,
tempore pacis alluscente (Cocc., Hgst.). The gerund נדמה adds to the
force; and מלך ישׂ is not this or the other king, but as in [Kg2
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#007.md), the king generally, i.e., the
monarchy of Israel.
