### [2 Chronicles Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 9:1</span></span>

The visit of the queen of Sheba. Cf. [Kg1
10:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001). - This event is narrated as a
practical proof of Solomon's extraordinary wisdom. The narrative agrees
so exactly in both texts, with the exception of some few quite
unimportant differences, that we must regard them as literal extracts
from an original document which they have used in common. For the
commentary on this section, see on [Kg1
10:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001).

[2 Chronicles 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 9:13</span></span>

Solomon's revenue in gold, and the use he made of it. Cf. [Kg1
10:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014), and the commentary there on
this section, which is identical in both narratives, with the exception
of some trifling differences. Before מביאים והסּחרים the relative
pronoun is to be supplied: "and what the merchants brought." As to the
derivation of the word פּחות, which comes from the Aramaic form פּחה,
governor ([Ch2 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#014)), see on [Hag
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001). - תּרשׁישׁ הלכות אניּות, in [Ch2
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#021), ships going to Tarshish, is an
erroneous paraphrase of תּרשׁישׁ אניּות, Tarshish-ships, i.e., ships
built for long sea voyages; for the fleet did not go to Tartessus in
Spain, but to Ophir in Southern Arabia (see on [Kg1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026).). All the rest has been
explained in the commentary on 1 Kings 10.

[2 Chronicles 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 9:22</span></span>

In [Ch2 9:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#022), all that remained to
be said of Solomon's royal glory, his riches, his wisdom, and his
revenues, is in conclusion briefly summed up, as in [Kg1
10:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023). From [Ch2
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025) onwards, the account given in the
Chronicle diverges from that in [Kg1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026)., in so far that what is
narrated in [Kg1 10:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026) concerning
Solomon's chariots and horses, and his trade with Egypt in horses, is
here partly replaced by statements similar in import to those in 1 Kings
5, because the former matters had been already treated of in Chr. [Ch2
1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014).

[2 Chronicles 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 9:25</span></span>

[Ch2 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025) does not correspond to the
passage [Kg1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026), but in contents
and language agrees with [Kg1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006), and
[Ch2 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#026) with [Kg1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001). Only the general estimate of
Solomon's riches in gold and silver, in [Ch2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#027), repeated from [Ch2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#015), corresponds to [Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027). Finally, in [Ch2
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#028) the whole description is rounded
off; all that has already been said in [Ch2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#016), [Ch2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017) as to the trade in horses with
Egypt ([Kg1 10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028)) being drawn
together into one general statement.

[2 Chronicles 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch2 9:29</span></span>

Conclusion of Solomon's history. - [Ch2
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029). Sources; see the introduction.

[Ch2 9:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#030)

The length of his reign, his death and burial, and his successor, as in
[Kg1 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#042).
