Longing for Zion in a Hostile Country

The Second Book of Psalms consists entirely of Elohimic Psalms (vid.,
Introduction, p. 12); for whilst in the First Book יהוה occurred 272
times and אלהים only 15 times, the relation is here reversed: אלהים
occurs 164 times, and יהוה only 30 times, and in almost every instance
by a departure from the customary mode of expression for reasons that
lie close at hand.

At the head of these Psalms written in the Elohimic style there stand
seven inscribed לבני־קרח. That here as in לאסף the ל is Lamed acutoris,
is made clear by the fact that none of these Psalms, as might be
expected, have לדוד in addition to the name of the author. The lxx
renders it τοῖς υἱοῖς Κορέ, just as it does τῷ Δαυίδ, without
distinguishing the one ל from the other indicating the authorship, and
even in the Talmud is similar meaning to the Lamed of לדוד is assumed.
It is certainly remarkable that instead of an author it is always the
family that is named, a rule from which Ps 88 (which see) is only a
seeming departure. The designation "Bohmische Br׬der" in the hymnology
of the German church is very similar. Probably the Korahitic songs
originally formed a book of themselves, which bore the title שׁירי בני
קרה or something similar; and then the בני קרה of this title passed over
to the inscription of each separate song of those incorporated in two
groups in the Psalm-collection, just as appears also to be the case with
the inscription שׁיר המעלות, which is repeated fifteen times. Or we must
suppose that it had become a family custom in the circle of the singers
among the Korahites to allow the individual to retreat behind the joint
responsibility of family unity, and, vying together, to expiate the name
of their unfortunate ancestor by the best liturgical productions.

For Korah, the great-grandson of Levi, and grandson of Kehaath, is the
same as he who perished by a divine judgment on account of his rebellion
against Moses and Aaron (Num. 16), whose sons, however, were not
involved with him in this judgment ([Num
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011).md). In David's time the בני קרה
were one of the most renowned families of the Levite race of the
Kehathites. The kingship of the promise very soon found valiant
adherents and defenders in this family. Korahites gathered together to
David to Ziklag, in order to aid in defending him and his title to the
throne with the sword ([Ch1 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#006).md); for
הקּרחים in this passage can hardly (as Bertheau is of opinion) be
descendants of the קרה of the family of Judah mentioned in [Ch1
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#043.md), but otherwise unrenowned, since
that name is elsewhere, viz., in [Ch1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md), [Ch1
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#031.md), a Levitic family name. In
Jerusalem, after the Exile, Korahites were keepers of the temple gates
([Ch1 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md); [Neh
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#019).md), and the chronicler there
informs us that even in David's time they were keepers of the threshold
of the אהל (erected over the Ark on Zion); and still earlier, in the
time of Moses, in the camp of Jahve they were appointed as watchers of
the entrance. They retained this ancient calling, to which allusion is
made in [Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md), in connection with
the new arrangements instituted by David. The post of door-keeper in the
temple was assigned to two branches of the Korahite families together
with one Merarite (1 Chron 26:1-19). But they also even then served as
musicians in the sanctuary. Heman, one of the three precentors (to be
distinguished from Heman the wise man mentioned in [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031).md), was a Korahite ([Ch1
6:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#018).md); his fourteen sons belonged,
together with the four sons of Asaph and the six sons of Ethan, to the
twenty-four heads of the twenty-four divisions of the musicians (1 Chr.
25). The Korahites were also renowned even in the days of Jehoshaphat as
singers and musicians; see [Ch2 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#019.md),
where a plural בּני הקּרחים (cf. Ges. 108, 3) is formed from בני־קרה,
which has as it were become smelted together as one word. Whereas in the
period after the Exile there is no longer any mention of them in this
character. We may therefore look for Korahitic Psalms belonging to the
post-Davidic time of the kings; whereas we ought at the outset to be
less inclined to find any post-exilic Psalms among them. The common
feature of this circle of songs consists herein, - they delight in the
praise of Elohim as the King who sits enthroned in Jerusalem, and join
in the services in His temple with the tenderest and most genuine
emotion. And this impress of unity which they bear speaks strongly in
favour of taking לבני־קרח in the sense of denoting authorship.

The composer of the משׂיל, [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md), finds himself, against his
will, at a great distance from the sanctuary on Zion, the resting-place
of the divine presence and manifestation, surrounded by an ungodly
people, who mock at him as one forsaken of God, and he comforts his
sorrowful soul, looking longingly back upon that which it has lost, with
the prospect of God's help which will soon appear. All the complaints
and hopes that he expresses sound very much like those of David during
the time of Absalom. David's yearning after the house of God in [Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md); [Psa
26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md); 55; [Psa
63:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md), finds its echo here: the
conduct and outlines of the enemies are also just the same; even the
sojourn in the country east of Jordan agrees with David's settlement at
that time at Mahanaim in the mountains of Gilead. The Korahite, however,
as is to be assumed in connection with a lyric poem, speaks out of the
depth of his own soul, and not, as Hengstenberg and Tholuck maintain,
"as from the soul of David." He merely shares David's vexation, just as
he then in [Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md) prays for the
anointed one. This [Psa 84:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)
breathes forth the same feelings, and even in other respects bears
traces of the same author; cf. אל חי, [Psa
84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md); [Psa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md); משׁכּנותיך, [Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md); [Psa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md); מזבּחותיך, [Psa
84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md); [Psa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004.md); and the similar use of עוד, [Psa
84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md); [Psa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md), cf. [Isa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020.md); [Jer
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015.md). The distinguishing features of
the Korahitic type of Psalm meet us in both Psalms in the most strong
and vivid manner, viz., the being joyous and weeping with God's
anointed, the praise of God the King, and the yearning after the
services in the holy place. And there are, it is true, thoughts that
have been coined by David which we here and there distinctly hear in
them (cf. [Psa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md)., [Psa
84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md), with [Psa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002).md); but they are reproduced with a
characteristic beauty peculiar to the author himself. We do not,
therefore, in the least doubt that [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) is the poem of a Korahitic
Levite, who found himself in exile beyond the Jordan among the
attendants of David, his exiled king.

Concerning [Psa 43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md) Eusebius has
said: ὅτι μέρος ἔοικεν εἶναι τοῦ πρὸ αὐτοῦ δεδήλωται ἔκ τε τῶν ὁμοίων ἐν
ἀμφοτέροις λόγων καὶ ἐκ τῆς ἐμφεροῦς διανοίας, and an old Midrash
reckons 147 Psalms, taking [Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)
together as one, just as with [Psa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md), [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md). The similarity of the situation,
of the general impress, of the structure, and of the refrain, is
decisive in favour of these Psalms, which are commonly reckoned as two,
being one. The one Psalm consists of three parts: thrice his pain breaks
forth into complaint, and is each time again overcome by the admonitory
voice of his higher consciousness. In the depicting of the past and the
future there is unmistakeable progress. And it is not until the third
part ([Psa 43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001).md) that complaint,
resignation, and hope are perfected by the language of confident prayer
which supervenes. The unity of the Psalms is not affected by the
repetition of [Psa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md) in [Psa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002.md), since [Psa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md) is also a repetition of [Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md). Beside an edging in by means of
the refrain, the poet is also fond of such internal links of connection.
The third part has thereby come to consist of thirteen lines, whereas
the other two parts consist of twelve lines each.

What a variegated pattern card of hypotheses modern criticism opens out
before us in connection with this Psalm ([Psa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001).md)! Vaihinger regards it as a song
composed by one of the Levites who was banished by Athaliah. Ewald
thinks that King Jeconiah, who was carried away to Babylon, may have
composed the Psalm; and in fact, when (and this is inferred from the
Psalm itself) on the journey to Babylon, he may have been detained just
a night in the vicinity of Hermon. Reuss (in the Nouvelle Revue de
Thologie, 1858) prefers to suppose it is one of those who were carried
off with Jeconiah (among whom there were also priests, as Ezekiel).
Hitzig, however, is no less decisive in his view that the author is a
priest who was carried off in the direction of Syria at the time of the
wars of the Seleucidae and Ptolemies; probably Onias III, high priest
from 199 b.c., the collector of the Second Book of the Psalms, whom the
Egyptians under the general Skopas carried away to the citadel of
Paneas. Olshausen even here, as usual, makes Antiochus Epiphanes his
watchword. In opposition to this positive criticism, Maurer adheres to
the negative; he says: quaerendo elegantissimi carminis scriptore
frustra se fatigant interpretes.

[Psalms 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 42:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 42:2-6) The poet compares the thirsting of his soul after God to
the thirsting of a stag. איּל (like other names of animals is epicoene,
so that there is no necessity to adopt Bצttcher's emendation כּעיּלת
תערג) is construed with a feminine predicate in order to indicate the
stag (hind) as an image of the soul. ערג is not merely a quiet
languishing, but a strong, audible thirsting or panting for water,
caused by prevailing drought, [Psa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002.md); [Joe
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020.md); the signification desiderare
refers back to the primary notion of inclinare (cf. Arab. 'l-mı̂l, the
act of inclining), for the primary meaning of the verb Arab. ‛rj is to
be slanting, inclined or bent, out of which has been developed the
signification of ascending and moving upwards, which is transferred in
Hebrew to an upward-directed longing. Moreover, it is not with Luther
(lxx, Vulgate and authorized version) to be rendered: as the (a) stag
crieth, etc., but (and it is accented accordingly): as a stag, which,
etc. אפיק = אפק is, according to its primary signification, a
watercourse holding water (vid., [Psa
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016).md). By the addition of מים the
full and flowing watercourse is distinguished from one that is dried up.
על and אל point to the difference in the object of the longing, viz.,
the hind has this object beneath herself, the soul above itself; the
longing of the one goes deorsum, the longing of the other sursum. The
soul's longing is a thirsting לאל חי. Such is the name here applied to
God (as in [Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003).md) in the sense in
which flowing water is called living, as the spring or fountain of life
([Psa 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010).md) from which flows forth a
grace that never dries up, and which stills the thirst of the soul. The
spot where this God reveals Himself to him who seeks Him is the
sanctuary on Zion: when shall I come and appear in the presence of
Elohim?! The expression used in the Law for the three appearings of the
Israelites in the sanctuary at solemn feasts is אל־פני ה נראה or את־פני,
[Exo 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017.md); [Exo
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#023.md). Here we find instead of this
expression, in accordance with the license of poetic brevity, the bare
acc. localis which is even used in other instances in the definition of
localities, e.g., [Eze 40:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044).md).
Bttcher, Olshausen, and others are of opinion that אראה in the mind of
the poet is to be read אראה, and that it has only been changed into אראה
through the later religious timidity; but the avoidance of the phrase
ראה פּני ה is explained from the fundamental assumption of the Tra that
a man could not behold God's פנים without dying, [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020.md). The poet now tells us in [Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md) what the circumstances were which
drove him to such intense longing. His customary food does not revive
him, tears are his daily bread, which day and night run down upon his
mouth (cf. [Psa 80:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#006.md); [Psa
102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020).md), and that בּאמר, when say to
him, viz., the speakers, all day long, i.e., continually: Where is thy
God? Without cessation, these mocking words are continually heard,
uttered again and again by those who are found about him, as their
thoughts, as it were, in the soul of the poet. This derision, in the
Psalms and in the Prophets, is always the keenest sting of pain: [Psa
79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010.md); [Psa
115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002.md) (cf. [Psa
71:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011).md), [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017.md); [Mic
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010.md).

In this gloomy present, in which he is made a mock of, as one who is
forsaken of God, on account of his trust in the faithfulness of the
promises, he calls to remembrance the bright and cheerful past, and he
pours out his soul within him (on the עלי used here and further on
instead of בּי or בּקרבּי, and as distinguishing between the ego and the
soul, vid., Psychol. S. 152; tr. p. 180), inasmuch as he suffers it to
melt entirely away in pain ([Job
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#016).md). As in [Psa
77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004.md), the cohortatives affirm that he
yields himself up most thoroughly to this bittersweet remembrance and to
this free outward expression of his pain אלּה (haecce) points forwards;
the כּי (quod) which follows opens up the expansion of this word. The
futures, as expressing the object of the remembrance, state what was a
habit in the time past. עבר frequently signifies not praeterire, but,
without the object that is passed over coming into consideration, porro
ire. סך (a collateral form of סך), properly a thicket, is figuratively
(cf. [Isa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017.md); [Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034).md) an interwoven mass, a mixed
multitude. The rendering therefore is: that I moved on in a dense crowd
(here the distinctive Zinnor). The form אדּדּם is Hithpa., as in [Isa
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015.md), after the form הדּמּה from the
verb דּדה, "to pass lightly and swiftly along," derived by reduplication
from the root דא (cf. Arab. d'ud'u), which has the primary meaning to
push, to drive (ἐλαύνειν, pousser), and in various combinations of the ד
(דא, Arab. dah, דח, Arab. da‛, דב, דף) expresses manifold shades of
onward motion in lighter or heavier thrusts or jerks. The suffix, as in
גּדלני = גּדל עמּי, [Job 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#018.md) (Ges.
121, 4), denotes those in reference to whom, or connection with whom,
this moving onwards took place, so that consequently אדּדּם includes
within itself, together with the subjective notion, the transitive
notion of אדדּם, for the singer of the Psalm is a Levite; as an example
in support of this אדּדּם, vid., [Ch2
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#027.md)., cf. v. 21. המון חוגג is the
apposition to the personal suffix of this אדדם: with them, a multitude
keeping holy-day. In [Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md) the
poet seeks to solace and encourage himself at this contrast of the
present with the past: Why art thou thus cast down... (lxx ἵνα τί
περίλυπος εἶ, κ. τ. λ., cf. [Mat
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038.md); [Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027).md). It is the spirit which, as the
stronger and more valiant part of the man, speaks to the soul as to the
σκεῦος ἀσθενέστερον; the spiritual man soothes the natural man. The
Hithpa. השׁתּוחח, which occurs only here and in [Psa
43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md), signifies to bow one's self
very low, to sit down upon the ground like a mourner ([Psa
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014.md); [Psa
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#007).md), and to bend one's self
downwards ([Psa 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#026).md). המה (the
future of which Ben-Asher here points ותּהמי, but Ben-Naphtali ותּהמּי),
to utter a deep groan, to speak quietly and mumbling to one's self. Why
this gnawing and almost desponding grief? I shall yet praise Him with
thanksgiving, praise ישׁוּעות פּניו, the ready succour of His
countenance turned towards me in mercy. Such is the text handed down to
us. Although it is, however, a custom with the psalmists and prophets
not to express such refrainlike thoughts in exactly the same form and
words (cf. [Psa 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md), [Psa
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#009.md); [Psa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013.md), 21; [Psa
56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005.md), [Psa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#011.md); [Psa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010), 18.md), nevertheless it is to be
read here by a change in the division both of the words and the verses,
according to [Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md) and [Psa
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005.md), ישׁוּעות פּני ואלהי, as is done
by the lxx (Cod. Alex.), Syriac, Vulgate, and most modern expositors.
For the words ישׁועות פניו, though in themselves a good enough sense
(vid., e.g., [Psa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md), [Isa
64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009).md), produce no proper closing
cadence, and are not sufficient to form a line of a verse.

(Note: Even an old Hebrew MS directs attention to the erroneousness of
the Soph pasuk here; vid., Pinsker, Einleitung, S. 133 l.)

[Psalms 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 42:6</span></span>

(Heb.: 42:7-12) The poet here continues to console himself with God's
help. God Himself is indeed dishonoured in him; He will not suffer the
trust he has reposed in Him to go unjustified. True, עלי seems at the
beginning of the line to be tame, but from עלי and אזכּרך, the beginning
and end of the line, standing in contrast, עלי is made emphatic, and it
is at the same time clear that על־כּן is not equivalent to אשׁר על־כּן -
which Gesenius asserts in his Lexicon, erroneously referring to [Psa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md); [Psa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003.md), is a poetical usage of the
language; an assertion for which, however, there is as little support as
that כּי על־כּן in [Num 14:43](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#043.md) and
other passages is equivalent to על־כּן כּי. In all such passages, e.g.,
[Jer 48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md), על־כּן means "therefore,"
and the relationship of reason and consequence is reversed. So even
here: within him his soul is bowed very low, and on account of this
downcast condition he thinks continually of God, from whom he is
separated. Even in [Jon 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#008.md) this
thinking upon God does not appear as the cause but as the consequence of
pain. The "land of Jordan and of Hermonim" is not necessarily the
northern mountain range together with the sources of the Jordan. The
land beyond the Jordan is so called in opposition to ארץ לבנון, the land
on this side. According to Dietrich (Abhandlungen, S. 18), חרמונים is an
amplificative plural: the Hermon, as a peak soaring far above all lower
summits. John Wilson (Lands of the Bible, ii. 161) refers the plural to
its two summits. But the plural serves to denote the whole range of the
Antilebanon extending to the south-east, and accordingly to designate
the east Jordanic country. It is not for one moment to be supposed that
the psalmist calls Hermon even, in comparison with his native Zion, the
chosen of God. הר מצער, i.e., the mountain of littleness: the other
member of the antithesis, the majesty of Zion, is wanting, and the מן
which is repeated before הר is also opposed to this. Hitzig, striking
out the מ of מהר, makes it an address to Zion: "because I remember thee
out of the land of Jordan and of summits of Hermon, thou little
mountain;" but, according to [Psa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md), these words are addressed to
Elohim. In the vicinity of Mitz‛are, a mountain unknown to us, in the
country beyond Jordan, the poet is sojourning; from thence he looks
longingly towards the district round about his home, and just as there,
in a strange land, the wild waters of the awe-inspiring mountains roar
around him, there seems to be a corresponding tumult in his soul. In
[Psa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md) he depicts the natural
features of the country round about him - and it may remind one quite as
much of the high and magnificent waterfalls of the lake of Muzêrı̂b as of
the waterfall at the course of the Jordan near Paneas and the waters
that dash headlong down the mountains round about - and in [Psa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md) he says that he feels just as
though all these threatening masses of water were following like so many
waves of misfortune over his head (Tholuck, Hitzig, and Riehm). Billow
follows billow as if called by one another (cf. [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md) concerning the continuous antiphon
of the seraphim) at the roar (לקול as in [Hab
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016).md) of the cataracts, which in their
terrible grandeur proclaim the Creator, God (lxx τῶν καταῤῥακτῶν σου) -
all these breaking, sporting waves of God pass over him, who finds
himself thus surrounded by the mighty works of nature, but taking no
delight in them; and in them all he sees nothing but the mirrored image
of the many afflictions which threaten to involve him in utter
destruction (cf. the borrowed passage in that mosaic work taken from the
Psalms, [Jon 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#004).md).

He, however, calls upon himself in [Psa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#009.md) to take courage in the hope that
a morning will dawn after this night of affliction ([Psa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006).md), when Jahve, the God of
redemption and of the people of redemption, will command His
loving-kindness (cf. [Psa 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005.md), Amos;
3f.); and when this by day has accomplished its work of deliverance,
there follows upon the day of deliverance a night of thanksgiving ([Job
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010).md): the joyous excitement, the
strong feeling of gratitude, will not suffer him to sleep. The suffix of
שׁירה is the suffix of the object: a hymn in praise of Him, prayer
(viz., praiseful prayer, [Hab 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001).md) to
the God of his life (cf. Sir. 23:4), i.e., who is his life, and will not
suffer him to come under the dominion of death. Therefore will he say
(אומרה), in order to bring about by prayer such a day of loving-kindness
and such a night of thanksgiving songs, to the God of his rock, i.e.,
who is his rock (gen. apos.): Why, etc.? Concerning the different
accentuation of למה here and in [Psa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002.md), vid., on [Psa
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md) (cf. [Psa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001).md). In this instance, where it is
not followed by a guttural, it serves as a "variation" Hitzig); but even
the retreating of the tone when a guttural follows is not consistently
carried out, vid., [Psa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md), cf. [Sa1
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015) (Ew. 243, b.md). The view of
Vaihinger and Hengstenberg is inadmissible, viz., that [Psa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md) to [Psa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md) are the "prayer," which the
psalmist means in [Psa 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#009.md); it is the
prayerful sigh of the yearning for deliverance, which is intended to
form the burthen of that prayer. In some MSS we find the reading כּרצח
instead of בּרצח; the בּ is here really synonymous with the כּ, it is
the Beth essentiae (vid., [Psa 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002).md):
after the manner of a crushing (cf. [Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027.md), and the verb in [Psa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004) of overthrowing a wall.md) in my
bones, i.e., causing me a crunching pain which seethes in my bones, mine
oppressors reproach me (חרף with the transfer of the primary meaning
carpere, as is also customary in the Latin, to a plucking and stripping
one of his good name). The use of ב here differs from its use in [Psa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md); for the reproaching is not
added to the crushing as a continuing state, but is itself thus crushing
in its operation (vid., [Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004).md).
Instead of בּאמר we have here the easier form of expression בּאמרם; and
in the refrain פּני ואלהי, which is also to be restored in [Psa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md).
