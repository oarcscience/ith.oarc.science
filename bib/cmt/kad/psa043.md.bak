### [Psalms Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 43:1</span></span>

The Elohimic Judica (the introit of the so-called Cross or Passion
Sunday which opens the celebritas Passionis), with which the
supplicatory and plaintive first strophe of the Psalm begins, calls to
mind the Jehovic Judica in [Psa 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009.md);
[Psa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md); [Psa
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md), [Psa
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#024.md) : judge me, i.e., decide my
cause (lxx κρῖνόν με, Symmachus κρῖνόν μοι). ריבה has the tone upon the
ultima before the ריבי which begins with the half-guttural ר, as is also
the case in [Psa 74:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022.md); [Psa
119:154](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#154.md). The second prayer runs:
vindica me a gente impia; מן standing for contra in consequence of a
constr. praegnans. לא־חסיד is here equivalent to one practising no חסד
towards men, that is to say, one totally wanting in that חסד, by which
God's חסד is to be imitated and repaid by man in his conduct towards his
fellow-men. There is some uncertainty whether by אישׁ one chief enemy,
the leader of all the rest, is intended to be mentioned side by side
with the unloving nation, or whether the special manner of his enemies
is thus merely individualised. עולה means roguish, mischievous conduct,
utterly devoid of all sense of right. In [Psa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002.md) the poet establishes his petition
by a twofold Why. He loves God and longs after Him, but in the mirror of
his present condition he seems to himself like one cast off by Him. This
contradiction between his own consciousness and the inference which he
is obliged to draw from his afflicted state cannot remain unsolved. אלהי
מעזּי, God of my fortress, is equivalent to who is my fortress. Instead
of אלך we here have the form אתהלּך, of the slow deliberate gait of one
who is lost in his own thoughts and feelings. The sting of his pain is
his distance from the sanctuary of his God. In connection with [Psa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md) one is reminded of [Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md) and [Exo
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#013.md), quite as much as of [Psa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#009.md). "Light and truth" is equivalent
to mercy and truth. What is intended is the light of mercy or
loving-kindness which is coupled with the truth of fidelity to the
promises; the light, in which the will or purpose of love, which is
God's most especial nature, becomes outwardly manifest. The poet wishes
to be guided by these two angels of God; he desires that he may be
brought (according tot he Chethb of the Babylonian text יבואוני, "let
come upon me;" but the אל which follows does not suit this form) to the
place where his God dwells and reveals Himself. "Tabernacles" is, as in
[Psa 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md); [Psa
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md), an amplificative designation of
the tent, magnificent in itself and raised to special honour by Him who
dwells therein.

[Psalms 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 43:4</span></span>

The poet, in anticipation, revels in the thought of that which he has
prayed for, and calls upon his timorous soul to hope confidently for it.
The cohortatives in [Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004.md) are, as
in Ps 39:14 and frequently, an apodosis to the petition. The poet knows
no joy like that which proceeds from God, and the joy which proceeds
from Him he accounts as the very highest; hence he calls God אל שׂמחת
גּילי, and therefore he knows no higher aim for his longing than again
to be where the fountainhead of this exultant joy is ([Hos
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#005).md), and where it flows forth in
streams ([Psa 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009).md). Removed back
thither, he will give thanks to Him with the cithern (Beth instrum.). He
calls Him אלהים אלהי, an expression which, in the Elohim-Psalms, is
equivalent to יהוה אלהי in the Jahve-Psalms. The hope expressed in [Psa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004.md) casts its rays into the prayer in
[Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md). In [Psa
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005.md), the spirit having taken courage
in God, holds this picture drawn by hope before the distressed soul,
that she may therewith comfort herself. Instead of wthmy, [Psa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md), the expression here used, as in
Ps 42:12, is וּמה־תּהמי. Variations like these are not opposed to a
unity of authorship.
