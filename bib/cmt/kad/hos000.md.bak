Hosea

Introduction

The Person of the Prophet. - Hosea, הושׁע, i.e., help, deliverance, or
regarding it as abstractum pro concreto, helper, salvator, Ὠσηέ (lxx.)
or Ὡσηέ ([Rom 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020)), Osee (Vulg..md), the
son of a certain Beēri, prophesied, according to the heading to his book
([Hos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001).md), in the reigns of the kings
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah, and in that of king
Jeroboam, son of Joash, of Israel; and, as the nature of his prophecies
clearly proves, he prophesied not only concerning, but in, the kingdom
of the ten tribes, so that we must regard him as a subject of that
kingdom. This is favoured not only by the fact that his prophetic
addresses are occupied throughout with the kingdom of the ten tribes,
but also by the peculiar style and language of his prophecies, which
have here and there an Aramaean colouring (for example, such forms as
אמאסאך, [Hos 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006); חכּי (inf..md), [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md); קימושׁ for קמּושׁ, [Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md); קאם for קם, [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md); תּרגּלתּי, [Hos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md); אוכיל for אאכיל, [Hos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004.md); תּלוּא, in [Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md), יפריא for יפרה [Hos
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015.md); and such words as רתת, [Hos
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md); אהי for איּה [Hos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010.md), [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014).md), and still more by the intimate
acquaintance with the circumstances and localities of the northern
kingdom apparent in such passages as [Hos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md); [Hos
6:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md); [Hos
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md); [Hos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006.md)., which even goes so far that he
calls the Israelitish kingdom "the land" in [Hos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002.md), and afterwards speaks of the king
of Israel as "our king" ([Hos 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005).md). On
the other hand, neither the fact that he mentions the kings of Judah in
the heading, to indicate the period of his prophetic labours ([Hos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001).md), nor the repeated allusions to
Judah in passing ([Hos 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007.md); [Hos
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002.md); [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md), [Hos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010.md), [Hos
5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#012.md); [Hos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md), [Hos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md); [Hos
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md); [Hos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md), [Hos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003).md), furnish any proof that he was a
Judaean by birth, as Jahn and Maurer suppose. The allusion to the kings
of Judah ([Hos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001).md), and that before
king Jeroboam of Israel, may be accounted for not from any outward
relation to the kingdom of Judah, but from the inward attitude which
Hosea assumed towards that kingdom in common with all true prophets. As
the separation of the ten tribes from the house of David was in its
deepest ground apostasy from Jehovah (see the commentary on 1 Kings
12.), the prophets only recognised the legitimate rulers of the kingdom
of Judah as true kings of the people of God, whose throne had the
promise of permanent endurance, even though they continued to render
civil obedience to the kings of the kingdom of Israel, until God Himself
once more broke up the government, which he had given to the ten tribes
in His anger to chastise the seed of David which had fallen away from
Him ([Hos 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#011).md). It is from this
point of view that Hosea, in the heading to his book, fixes the date of
his ministry according to the reigns of the kings of Judah, of whom he
gives a complete list, and whom he also places first; whereas he only
mentions the name of one king of Israel, viz., the king in whose reign
he commenced his prophetic course, and that not merely for the purpose
of indicating the commencement of his career with greater precision, as
Calvin and Hengstenberg suppose, but still more because of the
importance attaching to Jeroboam II in relation to the kingdom of the
ten tribes.

Before we can arrive at a correct interpretation of the prophecies of
Hosea, it is necessary, as [Hos 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)
and 2 clearly show, that we should determine with precision the time
when he appeared, inasmuch as he not only predicted the overthrow of the
house of Jehu, but the destruction of the kingdom of Israel as well. The
reference to Uzziah is not sufficient for this; for during the fifty-two
years' reign of this king of Judah, the state of things in the kingdom
of the ten tribes was immensely altered. When Uzziah ascended the
throne, the Lord had looked in mercy upon the misery of the ten tribes
of Israel, and had sent them such help through Jeroboam, that, after
gaining certain victories over the Syrians, he was able completely to
break down their supremacy over Israel, and to restore the ancient
boundaries of the kingdom ([Kg2
14:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md). But this elevation of
Israel to new power did not last long. In the thirty-seventh year of
Uzziah's reign, Zechariah, the son and successor of Jeroboam, was
murdered by Shallum after a reign of only six months, and with him the
house of Jehu was overthrown. From this time forward, yea, even from the
death of Jeroboam in the twenty-seventh year of Uzziah's reign, the
kingdom advanced with rapid strides towards utter ruin. Now, if Hosea
had simply indicated the time of his own labours by the reigns of the
kings of Judah, since his ministry lasted till the time of Hezekiah, we
might easily be led to assign its commencement to the closing years of
Uzziah's reign, in which the decline of the kingdom of Israel had
already begun to show itself and its ruin could be foreseen to be the
probable issue. If, therefore, it was to be made apparent that the Lord
does reveal future events to His servants even "before they spring
forth" ([Isa 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009).md), this could only be
done by indicating with great precision the time of Hosea's appearance
as a prophet, i.e., by naming king Jeroboam. Jeroboam reigned
contemporaneously with Uzziah for twenty-six years, and died in the
twenty-seventh year of the reign of the latter, who outlived him about
twenty-five years, and did not die till the second year of Pekah (see at
[Kg2 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md), [Kg2
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032).md). It is evident from this that
Hosea commenced his prophetic labours within the twenty-six years of the
contemporaneous reigns of Uzziah and Jeroboam, that is to say, before
the twenty-seventh year of the former, and continued to labour till a
very short time before the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes,
since he prophesied till the time of Hezekiah, in the sixth year of
whose reign Samaria was conquered by Shalmanezer, and the kingdom of
Israel destroyed. The fact that of all the kings of Israel Jeroboam only
is mentioned, may be explained from the fact that the house of Jehu, to
which he belonged, had been called to the throne by the prophet Elisha
at the command of God, for the purpose of rooting out the worship of
Baal from Israel, in return for which Jehu received the promise that his
sons should sit upon the throne to the fourth generation ([Kg2
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030).md); and Jeroboam, the
great-grandson of Jehu, was the last king through whom the Lord sent any
help to the ten tribes ([Kg2 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#027).md).
In his reign the kingdom of the ten tribes reached its greatest glory.
After his death a long-continued anarchy prevailed, and his son
Zechariah was only able to keep possession of the throne for half a
year. The kings who followed fell, one after another by conspiracies, so
that the uninterrupted and regular succession to the throne ceased with
the death of Jeroboam; and of the six rulers who came to the throne
after his death, not one was called by God through the intervention of a
prophet, and only two were able to keep possession of it for any length
of time, viz., Menahem for ten years, and Pekah for twenty.

Again, the circumstance that Hosea refers repeatedly to Judah in his
prophecies, by no means warrants the conclusion that he was a citizen of
the kingdom of Judah. The opinion expressed by Maurer, that an
Israelitish prophet would not have troubled himself about the Judeans,
or would have condemned their sins less harshly, is founded upon the
unscriptural assumption, that the prophets suffered themselves to be
influenced in their prophecies by subjective sympathies and antipathies
as mere morum magistri, whereas they simply proclaimed the truth as
organs of the Spirit of God, without any regard to man at all. If Hosea
had been sent out of Judah into the kingdom of Israel, like the prophet
in 1 Kings 13., or the prophet Amos, this would certainly have been
mentioned, at all events in the heading, just as in the case of Amos the
native land of the prophet is given. But cases of this kind formed very
rare exceptions to the general rule, since the prophets in Israel were
still more numerous than in the kingdom of Judah. In the reign of
Jeroboam the prophet Jonah was living and labouring there ([Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md); and the death of the prophet
Elisha, who had trained a great company of young men for the service of
the Lord in the schools of the prophets at Gilgal, Bethel, and Jericho,
had only occurred a few years before. The fact that a prophet who was
born in the kingdom of the ten tribes, and laboured there, alluded in
his prophecies to the kingdom of Judah, may be accounted for very
simply, from the importance which this kingdom possessed in relation to
Israel as a whole, both on account of the promises it had received, and
also in connection with its historical development. Whilst the promises
in the possession of the Davidic government of the kingdom of Judah
formed a firm ground of hope for godly men in all Israel, that the Lord
could not utterly and for ever cast off His people; the announcement of
the judgments, which would burst upon Judah also on account of its
apostasy, was intended to warn the ungodly against false trust in the
gracious promises of God, and to proclaim the severity and earnestness
of the judgment of God. This also explains the fact that whilst, on the
one hand, Hosea makes the salvation of the ten tribes dependent upon
their return to Jehovah their God and David their king ([Hos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007.md); [Hos
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002).md), and warns Judah against sinning
with Israel ([Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md), on the other
hand, he announces to Judah also that it is plunging headlong into the
very same ruin as Israel, in consequence of its sins ([Hos
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md), [Hos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010.md)., [Hos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md), [Hos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011), etc..md); whereas the conclusions
drawn by Ewald from these passages - namely, that at first Hosea only
looked at Judah from the distance, and that it was not till a later
period that he became personally acquainted with it, and not till after
he had laboured for a long time in the northern part of the kingdom that
he came to Judah and composed his book - are not only at variance with
the fact, that as early as [Hos 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002.md)
the prophet proclaims indirectly the expulsion of Judah from its own
land into captivity, but are founded upon the false notion, that the
prophets regarded their own subjective perceptions and individual
judgments as inspirations from God.

According to the heading, Hosea held his prophetic office for about
sixty or sixty-five years (viz., 27-30 years under Uzziah, 31 under
Jotham and Ahaz, and 1-3 years under Hezekiah). This also agrees with
the contents of his book. In [Hos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md),
the overthrow of the house of Jehu, which occurred about eleven or
twelve years after the death of Jeroboam, in the thirty-ninth year of
Uzziah ([Kg2 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010.md), [Kg2
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#013).md), is foretold as being near at
hand; and in [Hos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md), according to
the most probable explanation of this passage, the expedition of
Shalmanezer into Galilee, which occurred, according to [Kg2
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003.md), at the commencement of the reign
of Hoshea, the last of the Israelitish kings, is mentioned as having
already taken place, whilst a fresh invasion of the Assyrians is
threatened, which cannot be any other than the expedition of Shalmanezer
against king Hoshea, who had revolted from him, which ended in the
capture of Samaria after a three years' siege, and the destruction of
the kingdom of the ten tribes in the sixth year of Hezekiah. The reproof
in [Hos 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md), "They call to Egypt,
they go to Assyria," and that in [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md), "They do make a covenant with
the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt," point to the same period;
for they clearly refer to the time of Hoshea, who, notwithstanding the
covenant that he had made with Asshur, i.e., notwithstanding the oath of
fidelity rendered to Shalmanezer, purchased the assistance of the king
of Egypt by means of presents, that he might be able to shake off the
Assyrian yoke. The history knows nothing of any earlier alliances
between Israel and Egypt; and the supposition that, in these reproaches,
the prophet has in his mind simply two political parties, viz., an
Assyrian and an Egyptian, is hardly reconcilable with the words
themselves; nor can it be sustained by an appeal to [Isa
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017.md)., or even to [Zac
10:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#009.md), at least so far as the times
of Menahem are concerned. Nor is it any more possible to infer from [Hos
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md) and [Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md), that the active ministry of the
prophet did not extend beyond the reign of Jotham, on the ground that,
according to these passages, Gilead and Galilee, which were conquered
and depopulated by Tiglath-pileser, whom Ahaz called to his help ([Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md), were still in the possession
of Israel (Simson). For it is by no means certain that [Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md) presupposes the possession of
Galilee, but the words contained in this verse might have been uttered
even after the Assyrians had conquered the land to the east of the
Jordan; and in that case, the book, which comprises the sum and
substance of all that Hosea prophesied during a long period, must of
necessity contain historical allusions to events that were already
things of the past at the time when his book was prepared
(Hengstenberg). On the other hand, the whole of the attitude assumed by
Assyria towards Israel, according to [Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md); [Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006.md); [Hos
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md), points beyond the times of
Menahem and Jotham, even to the Assyrian oppression, which first began
with Tiglath-pileser in the time of Ahaz. Consequently there is no
ground whatever for shortening the period of our prophet's active
labours. A prophetic career of sixty years is not without parallel. Even
Elisha prophesied for at least fifty years (see at [Kg2
13:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#020).md). This simply proves,
according to the apt remark of Calvin, "how great and indomitable were
the fortitude and constancy with which he was endowed by the Holy
Spirit." Nothing certain is known concerning the life of the prophet;

(Note: The traditional accounts are very meagre, and altogether
unsupported. According to Pseudepiphanius, De vitis prophet. c. xi.,
Pseudo-Doroth. De prophetis, c. i., and in a Scholion before Ephr. Syri
Explan. in Hos., he sprang from Belemoth, or Belemōn, or Beelmoth, in
the tribe of Issachar, and is said to have died and been buried there.
On the other hand, according to a tradition current among the
inhabitants of Thessalonica, found in הקבלה שׁלשׁלת, he died in Babylon.
According to an Arabian legend, it was not far from Tripolis, viz., in
the city of Almenia; whilst the Arabs also point out a grave, which is
supposed to be his, in the land to the east of the Jordan, on the site
of Ramoth Gilead; cf. Simson, der Prophet Hosea, p. 1ff.)

but his inner life lies before us in his writings, and from these we may
clearly see that he had to sustain severe inward conflicts. For even if
such passages as [Hos 4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md), and [Hos
9:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md), contain no certain indications
of the fact, that he had to contend against the most violent hostilities
as well as secret plots, as Ewald supposes, the sight of the sins and
abominations of his countrymen, which he had to denounce and punish, and
the outburst of the divine judgments upon the kingdom thus incessantly
ripening for destruction, which he had to experience, could not fail to
fill his soul burning as it was for the deliverance of his people, with
the deepest anguish, and to involve him in all kinds of conflicts.

2\. Times of the Prophet - When Hosea was called to be a prophet, the
kingdom of the ten tribes of Israel had been elevated to a position of
great earthly power by Jeroboam II. Even under Joash the Lord had had
compassion upon the children of Israel, and had turned to them again for
the sake of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; so that Joash
had been able to recover the cities, which Hazael of Syria had conquered
in the reign of his father Jehoahaz, from Benhadad the son of Hazael,
and to restore them to Israel ([Kg2
8:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#023).md). The Lord sent still further
help through Jeroboam the son of Joash. Because He had not yet spoken to
root out the name of Israel under heaven, He gave them victory in war,
so that they were able to conquer Damascus and Hamath again, so far as
they had belonged to Judah under David and Solomon, and to restore the
ancient boundaries of Israel, from the province of Hamath to the Dead
Sea, according to the word of Jehovah the God of Israel, which He had
spoken through His servant the prophet Jonah ([Kg2
14:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md). But this revival of the
might and greatness of Israel was only the last display of divine grace,
through which the Lord sought to bring back His people from their evil
ways, and lead them to repentance. For the roots of corruption, which
the kingdom of Israel had within it from its very commencement, were not
exterminated either by Joash or Jeroboam. These kings did not depart
from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to
sin, any more than their predecessors ([Kg2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#011.md); [Kg2
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#024).md). Jehu, the founder of this
dynasty, had indeed rooted out Baal from Israel; but he had not departed
from the golden calves at Bethel and Dan, through the setting up of
which Jeroboam the son of Nebat had led Israel into sin ([Kg2
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#028).md). Nor did his successors take
any more care to walk in the law of Jehovah, the God of Israel, with all
their heart. Neither the severe chastisements which the Lord inflicted
upon the people and the kingdom, by delivering Israel up to the power of
Hazael king of Syria and his son Benhadad, in the time of Jehu and
Jehoahaz, causing it to be smitten in all its borders, and beginning to
cut off Israel ([Kg2 10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md); [Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003).md); nor the love and grace which He
manifested towards them in the reigns of Joash and Jeroboam, by
liberating them from the oppression of the Syrians, and restoring the
former greatness of the kingdom, - were sufficient to induce the king or
the people to relinquish the worship of the calves. This sin of
Jeroboam, however, although it was Jehovah who was worshipped under the
symbol of the calf, was a transgression of the fundamental law of the
covenant, which the Lord had made with Israel, and therefore was a
formal departure from Jehovah the true God. And Jeroboam the son of
Nebat was not content with simply introducing images or symbols of
Jehovah, but had even banished from his kingdom the Levites, who opposed
this innovation, and had taken men out of the great body of the people,
who were not sons of Levi, and made them priests, and had gone so far as
to change the time of celebrating the feast of tabernacles from the
seventh month to the eighth ([Kg1
12:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031).md), merely for the purpose of
making the religious gulf which separated the two kingdoms as wide as
possible, and moulding the religious institutions of his kingdom
entirely according to his own caprice. Thus the worship of the people
became a political institution, in direct opposition to the idea of the
kingdom of God; and the sanctuary of Jehovah was changed into a king's
sanctuary (Amos 12:13). But the consequences of this image-worship were
even worse than these. Through the representation of the invisible and
infinite God under a visible and earthly symbol, the glory of the one
true God was brought down within the limits of the finite, and the God
of Israel was placed on an equality with the gods of the heathen. This
outward levelling was followed, with inevitable necessity, by an inward
levelling also. The Jehovah worshipped under the symbol of an ox was no
longer essentially different from the Baals of the heathen, by whom
Israel was surrounded; but the difference was merely a formal one,
consisting simply in a peculiar mode of worship, which had been
prescribed in His revelation of Himself, but which could not lay the
foundation of any permanently tenable party-wall. For, whilst the
heathen were accustomed to extend to the national Deity of Israel the
recognition which they accorded to the different Baals, as various modes
of revelation of one and the same Deity; the Israelites, in their turn,
were also accustomed to grant toleration to the Baals; and this speedily
passed into formal worship. "Outwardly, the Jehovah-worship still
continued to predominate; but inwardly, the worship of idols rose almost
into exclusive supremacy. When once the boundary lines between the two
religions were removed, it necessarily followed that that religion
acquired the strongest spiritual force, which was most in accordance
with the spirit of the nation. And from the very corruptions of human
nature this was not the strict Jehovah religion, which being given by
God did not bring down God to the low level of man, but sought to raise
man up to its own lofty height, placing the holiness of God in the
centre, and founding upon this the demand for holiness which it made
upon its professors; but the voluptuous, sensual teaching of idolatry,
pandering as it did to human corruption, just because it was from this
it had originally sprung" (Hengstenberg's Christology). This seems to
explain the fact, that whereas, according to the prophecies of Amos and
Hosea, the worship of Baal still prevailed in Israel under the kings of
the house of Jehu, according to the account given in the books of Kings
Jehu had rooted out Baal along with the royal house of Ahab (a Kings
10:28). Jehu had merely broken down the outward supremacy of the Baal
worship, and raised up the worship of Jehovah once more, under the
symbols of oxen or calves, into the state-religion. But this worship of
Jehovah was itself a Baal-worship, since, although it was to Jehovah
that the legal sacrifices were offered, and although His name was
outwardly confessed, and His feasts were observed ([Hos
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013).md), yet in heart Jehovah Himself
was made into a Baal, so that the people even called Him their Baal
([Hos 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#016).md), and observed "the days of
the Baals" ([Hos 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013).md).

This inward apostasy from the Lord, notwithstanding which the people
still continued to worship Him outwardly and rely upon His covenant, had
of necessity a very demoralizing influence upon the national life. With
the breach of the fundamental law of the covenant, viz., of the
prohibition against making any likeness of Jehovah, or worshipping
images made by men, more especially in consequence of the manner in
which this prohibition was bound up with the divine authority of the
law, all reverence not only for the holiness of the law of God, but for
the holy God Himself, was undermined. Unfaithfulness towards God and His
word begot faithlessness towards men. With the neglect to love God with
all the heart, love to brethren also disappeared. And spiritual adultery
had carnal adultery as its inevitable consequence, and that all the more
because voluptuousness formed a leading trait in the character of the
idolatry of Hither Asia. Hence all the bonds of love, of chastity, and
of order were loosened and broken, and Hosea uttered this complaint:
"There is no truthfulness, and no love, and no knowledge of God in the
land. Cursing, and murder, and stealing, and adultery; they break out,
and blood reaches to blood" ([Hos
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001).md). No king of Israel could put an
effectual stop to this corruption. By abolishing the worship of the
calves, he would have rendered the very existence of the kingdom
doubtful. For if once the religious wall of division between the kingdom
of Israel and the kingdom of Judah had been removed, the political
distinction would have been in danger of following. And this was really
what the founder of the kingdom of the ten tribes feared ([Kg1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#027).md), inasmuch as the royal family
that occupied the throne had received no promise from God of permanent
continuance. Founded as it was in rebellion against the royal house of
David, which God Himself had chosen, it bore within itself from the very
first the spirit of rebellion and revolution, and therefore the germs of
internal self-destruction. Under these circumstances, even the long, and
in outward respects very prosperous, reign of Jeroboam II. could not
possibly heal the deep-seated evils, but only helped to increase the
apostasy and immorality; since the people, whilst despising the riches
of the goodness and mercy of God, looked upon their existing prosperity
as simply a reward for their righteousness before God, and were
therefore confirmed in their self-security and sins. And this was a
delusion which false prophets loved to foster by predictions of
continued prosperity (cf. [Hos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007).md).
The consequence was, that when Jeroboam died, the judgments of God began
to burst upon the incorrigible nation. There followed, first of all, an
anarchy of eleven or twelve years; and it was not till after this that
his son Zechariah succeeded in ascending the throne. But at the end of
no more than six months he was murdered by Shallum, whilst he in his
turn was put to death after a reign of one month by Menahem, who reigned
ten years at Samaria ([Kg2 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#014.md), [Kg2
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#017).md). In his reign the Assyrian king
Phul invaded the land, and was only induced to leave it by the payment
of a heavy tribute ([Kg2 15:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019).md).
Menahem was followed by his son Pekachiah in the fiftieth year of
Uzziah's reign; but after a reign of hardly two years he was murdered by
his charioteer, Pekah the son of Remaliah, who held the throne for
twenty years ([Kg2 15:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#022).md), but who
accelerated the ruin of his kingdom by forming an alliance with the king
of Syria to attack the brother kingdom of Judah (Isaiah 7.). For king
Ahaz, when hard pressed by Pekah and the Syrians, called to his help the
Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser, who not only conquered Damascus and
destroyed the Syrian kingdom, but took a portion of the kingdom of
Israel, viz., the whole of the land to the east of the Jordan, and
carried away its inhabitants into exile ([Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md). Hoshea the son of Elah
conspired against Pekah, and slew him in the fourth year of the reign of
Ahaz; after which, an eight years' anarchy threw the kingdom into
confusion, so that it was not till the twelfth year of Ahaz that Hoshea
obtained possession of the throne. Very shortly afterwards, however, he
came into subjection to the Assyrian king Shalmanezer, and paid him
tribute. But after a time, in reliance upon the help of Egypt, he broke
his oath of fealty to the king of Assyria; whereupon Shalmanezer
returned, conquered the entire land, including the capital, and led
Israel captive into Assyria ([Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030.md); [Kg2
17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001).md).

3\. The Book of Hosea. - Called as he was at such a time as this to
proclaim to his people the word of the Lord, Hosea necessarily occupied
himself chiefly in bearing witness against the apostasy and corruption
of Israel, and in preaching the judgment of God. The ungodliness and
wickedness had become so great, that the destruction of the kingdom was
inevitable; and the degenerate nation was obliged to be given up into
the power of the Assyrians, the existing representatives of the heathen
power of the world. But as God the Lord has no pleasure in the death of
the sinner, but that he should turn and live, He would not exterminate
the rebellious tribes of the people of His possession from the earth, or
put them away for ever from His face, but would humble them deeply by
severe and long-continued chastisement, in order that He might bring
them to a consciousness of their great guilt and lead them to
repentance, so that He might at length have mercy upon them once more,
and save them from everlasting destruction. Consequently, even in the
book of Hosea, promises go side by side with threatenings and
announcements of punishment, and that not merely as the general hope of
better days, kept continually before the corrected nation by the
all-pitying love of Jehovah, which forgives even faithlessness, and
seeks out that which has gone astray (Sims.), but in the form of a very
distinct announcement of the eventual restoration of the nation, when
corrected by punishment, and returning in sorrow and repentance to the
Lord its God, and to David its king ([Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005).md) - an announcement founded upon
the inviolable character of the divine covenant of grace, and rising up
to the thought that the Lord will also redeem from hell and save from
death, yea, will destroy both death and hell ([Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014).md). Because Jehovah had married
Israel in His covenant of grace, but Israel, like an unfaithful wife,
had broken the covenant with its God, and gone a whoring after idols,
God, by virtue of the holiness of His love, must punish its
unfaithfulness and apostasy. His love, however, would not destroy, but
would save that which was lost. This love bursts out in the flame of
holy wrath, which burns in all the threatening and reproachful addresses
of Hosea. In this wrath, however, it is not the consuming fire of an
Elijah that burns so brightly; on the contrary, a gentle sound of divine
grace and mercy is ever heard in the midst of the flame, so that the
wrath but gives expression to the deepest anguish at the perversity of
the nation, which will not suffer itself to be brought to a
consciousness of the fact that its salvation rests with Jehovah its God,
and with Him alone, either by the severity of the divine chastisements,
or by the friendliness with which God has drawn Israel to Himself as
with cords of love. This anguish of love at the faithlessness of Israel
so completely fills the mind of the prophet, that his rich and lively
imagination shines perpetually by means of changes of figure and fresh
turns of thought, to open the eyes of the sinful nation to the abyss of
destruction by which it is standing, in order if possible to rescue it
from ruin. The deepest sympathy gives to his words a character of
excitement, so that for the most part he merely hints at the thoughts in
the briefest possible manner, instead of carefully elaborating them,
passing with rapid changes from one figure and simile to another, and
moving forward in short sentences and oracular utterances rather than in
a calmly finished address, so that his addresses are frequently obscure,
and hardly intelligible.

(Note: Jerome says of him, "commaticus est et quasi per sententias
loquens;" and Ewald discovers in his style "a kernel-like fulness of
language, and, notwithstanding many strong figures, which indicate not
only poetical boldness and originality but also the tolerably upright
thought of those times, a very great tenderness and warmth of language."
His diction is distinguished by many peculiar words and forms, such as
נאפוּפים ([Hos 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#004).md), אהבוּ הבוּ ([Hos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018).md), גּהה ([Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013).md), שׁעריריּה ([Hos
6:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001) :l0.md), הבהבים ([Hos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013).md), תּלאוּבת ([Hos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005).md); and by peculiar constructions,
such as לא על ([Hos 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016).md), אל־על ([Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007).md), מריבי כהן ([Hos
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004)), and many others..md)

His book does not contain a collection of separate addresses delivered
to the people, but, as is generally admitted now, a general summary of
the leading thoughts contained in his public addresses. The book is
divisible into two parts, viz., ch. 1-3 and 4-14, which give the kernel
of his prophetic labours, the one in a more condensed, and the other in
a more elaborate form. In the first part, which contains the "beginning
of the word of Jehovah by Hosea" ([Hos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002).md), the prophet first of all
describes, in the symbolical form of a marriage, contracted by the
command of God with an adulterous woman, the spiritual adultery of the
ten tribes of Israel, i.e., their falling away from Jehovah into
idolatry, together with its consequences, - namely, the rejection of the
rebellious tribes by the Lord, and their eventual return to God, and
restoration to favour ([Hos 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002.md); [Hos
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003).md). He then announces, in simple
prophetic words, not only the chastisements and punishments that will
come from God, and bring the people to a knowledge of the ruinous
consequences of their departure from God, but also the manifestations of
mercy by which the Lord will secure the true conversion of those who are
humbled by suffering, and their eventual blessedness through the
conclusion of a covenant founded in righteousness and grace (Hosea
2:4-23); and this attitude on the part of God towards His people is then
confirmed by a symbolical picture in [Hos
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md).

In the second part, these truths are expanded in a still more elaborate
manner; but the condemnation of the idolatry and moral corruption of
Israel, and the announcement of the destruction of the kingdom of the
ten tribes, predominate, - the saving prediction of the eventual
restoration and blessedness of those, who come to the consciousness of
the depth of their own fall, being but briefly touched upon. This part,
again, cannot be divided into separate addresses, as there is an entire
absence of all reliable indices, just as in the last part of Isaiah (ch.
40-66); but, like the latter, it falls into three large, unequal
sections, in each of which the prophetic address advances from an
accusation of the nation generally and in its several ranks, to a
description of the coming punishment, and finishes up with the prospect
of the ultimate rescue of the punished nation At the same time, an
evident progress is discernible in the three, not indeed of the kind
supposed by Ewald, namely, that the address contained in ch. 4-9:9
advances from the accusation itself to the contemplation of the
punishment proved to be necessary, and then rises through further
retrospective glances at the better days of old, at the destination of
the church, and at the everlasting love, to brighter prospects and the
firmest hopes; nor in that proposed by De Wette, viz., that the wrath
becomes more and more threatening from ch. 8 onwards, and the
destruction of Israel comes out more and more clearly before the
reader's eye. The relation in which the three sections stand to one
another is rather the following: In the first, ch. 4-6:3, the religious
and moral degradation of Israel is exhibited in all its magnitude,
together with the Judgment which follows upon the heels of this
corruption; and at the close the conversion and salvation aimed at in
this judgment are briefly indicated. In the second and much longer
section, Hosea 6:4-11:11, the incorrigibility of the sinful nation, or
the obstinate persistence of Israel in idolatry and unrighteousness, in
spite of the warnings and chastisements of God, is first exposed and
condemned (Hosea 6:4-7:16); then, secondly, the judgment to which they
are liable is elaborately announced as both inevitable and terrible
(Hosea 8:1-9:9); and thirdly, by pointing out the unfaithfulness which
Israel has displayed towards its God from the very earliest times, the
prophet shows that it has deserved nothing but destruction from off the
face of the earth (9:10-11:8), and that it is only the mercy of God
which will restrain the wrath, and render the restoration of Israel
possible ([Hos 11:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009).md). In the third
section (ch. 12-14) the ripeness of Israel for judgment is confirmed by
proofs drawn from its falling into Canaanitish ways, notwithstanding the
long-suffering, love, and fidelity with which God has always shown
Himself to be its helper and redeemer ([Hos
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001), 13.md). To this there is
appended a solemn appeal to return to the Lord; and the whole concludes
with a promise, that the faithful covenant God will display the fulness
of His love again to those who return to Him with a sincere confession
of their guilt, and will pour upon them the riches of His blessing ([Hos
14:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001).md).

This division of the book differs, indeed, from all the attempts that
have previously been made; but it has the warrant of its correctness in
the three times repeated promise ([Hos
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md); [Hos
9:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009.md), and [Hos
14:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002).md), by which each of the supposed
sections is rounded off. And within these sections we also meet with
pauses, by which they are broken up into smaller groups, resembling
strophes, although this further grouping of the prophet's words is not
formed into uniform strophes.

(Note: All attempts that have been made to break up the book into
different prophecies, belonging to different periods, are wrecked upon
the contents of the book itself; single sections being obliged to be
made into prophetic addresses, or declared to be such, and the period of
their origin being merely determined by arbitrary conjectures and
assumptions, or by fanciful interpretations, e.g., as that of the
chōdesh, or new moon, in [Hos 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007.md),
which is supposed to refer to the reign of Shallum, who only reigned one
month.)

For further remarks on this point, see the Exposition.

From what has been said, it clearly follows that Hosea himself wrote out
the quintessence of his prophecies, as a witness of the Lord against the
degenerate nation, at the close of his prophetic career, and in the book
which bears his name. The preservation of this book, on the destruction
of the kingdom of the ten tribes, may be explained very simply from the
fact that, on account of the intercourse carried on between the prophets
of the Lord in the two kingdoms, it found its way to Judah soon after
the time of its composition, and was there spread abroad in the circle
of the prophets, and so preserved. We find, for example, that Jeremiah
has used it again and again in his prophecies (compare Aug. Kueper,
Jeremias librorum ss. interpres atque vindex. Berol. 1837 p. 67 seq.).
