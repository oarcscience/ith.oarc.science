### [Psalms Chapter 132](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 132:0</span></span>

Prayer for the House of God and the House of David

[Psa 131:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md) designedly precedes
Psalms 132. The former has grown out of the memory of an utterance of
David when he brought home the Ark, and the latter begins with the
remembrance of David's humbly zealous endeavour to obtain a settled and
worthy abode for the God who sits enthroned above the Ark among His
people. It is the only Psalm in which the sacred Ark is mentioned. The
chronicler put [Psa 132:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008.md) into the
mouth of Solomon at the dedication of the Temple ([Ch2
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041)..md). After a passage borrowed from
[Psa 130:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#002.md) which is attached by עתּה
to Solomon's Temple-dedication prayer, he appends further borrowed
passages out of Psalms 132 with ועתּה. The variations in these verses of
the Psalms, which are annexed by him with a free hand and from memory
(Jahve Elohim for Jahve, לנוּחך for למנוּחתך, תּשׁוּעה for צדק, בּטּוב
ישׂמחוּ for ירנּנוּ), just as much prove that he has altered the Psalm,
and not reversely (as Hitzig persistently maintains), that the psalmist
has borrowed from the Chronicles. It is even still distinctly to be seen
how the memory of [Isa 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md) has
influenced the close of [Ch2 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042.md) in
the chronicler, just as the memory of [Isa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md) has perhaps also influenced the
close of [Ch2 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041.md).

The psalmist supplicates the divine favour for the anointed of Jahve for
David's sake. In this connection this anointed one is neither the high
priest, nor Israel, which is never so named (vid., [Hab
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013).md), nor David himself, who "in all
the necessities of his race and people stands before God," as
Hengstenberg asserts, in order to be able to assign this Son of degrees,
as others, likewise to the post-exilic time of the new colony.
Zerubbabel might more readily be understood (Baur), with whom, according
to the closing prophecy of the Book of Haggai, a new period of the
Davidic dominion is said to begin. But even Zerubbabel, the פּחת יהוּדה,
could not be called משׁיח, for this he was not. The chronicler applies
the Psalm in accordance with its contents. It is suited to the mouth of
Solomon. The view that it was composed by Solomon himself when the Ark
of the covenant was removed out of the tent-temple on Zion into the
Temple-building (Amyraldus, De Wette, Tholuck, and others), is favoured
by the relation of the circumstances, as they are narrated in [Ch2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#005.md)., to the desires of the Psalm, and
a close kinship of the Psalm with Ps 72 in breadth, repetitions of
words, and a laboured forward movement which is here and there a
somewhat uncertain advance. At all events it belongs to a time in which
the Davidic throne was still standing and the sacred Ark was not as yet
irrecoverably lost. That which, according to 2 Sam. 6, [Sa2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md), David did for the glory of Jahve,
and on the other hand is promised to him by Jahve, is here made by a
post-Davidic poet into the foundation of a hopeful intercessory prayer
for the kingship and priesthood of Zion and the church presided over by
both.

The Psalm consists of four ten-line strophes. Only in connection with
the first could any objection be raised, and the strophe be looked upon
as only consisting of nine lines. But the other strophes decide the
question of its measure; and the breaking up of the weighty [Psa
132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md) into two lines follows the
accentuation, which divides it into two parts and places את by itself as
being את (according to Accentssystem, xviii. 2, with Mugrash). Each
strophe is adorned once with the name of David; and moreover the
step-like progress which comes back to what has been said, and takes up
the thread and carries it forward, cannot fail to be recognised.

[Psalms 132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 132:1</span></span>

One is said to remember anything to another when he requites him
something that he has done for him, or when he does for him what he has
promised him. It is the post-Davidic church which here reminds Jahve of
the hereinafter mentioned promises (of the "mercies of David," [Ch2
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042.md), cf. [Isa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003).md) with which He has responded to
David's ענות. By this verbal substantive of the Pual is meant all the
care and trouble which David had in order to procure a worthy abode for
the sanctuary of Jahve. ענה ב signifies to trouble or harass one's self
about anything, afflictari (as frequently in the Book of Ecclesiastes);
the Pual here denotes the self-imposed trouble, or even that imposed by
outward circumsntaces, such as the tedious wars, of long, unsuccessful,
and yet never relaxed endeavours ([Kg1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#017).md). For he had vowed unto God that
he would give himself absolutely no rest until he had obtained a fixed
abode for Jahve. What he said to Nathan ([Sa2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002).md) is an indication of this vowed
resolve, which was now in a time of triumphant peace, as it seemed,
ready for being carried out, after the first step towards it had already
been taken in the removal of the Ark of the covenant to Zion (2 Sam. 6);
for 2 Sam 7 is appended to 2 Sam. 6 out of its chronological order and
only on account of the internal connection. After the bringing home of
the Ark, which had been long yearned for ([Psa
101:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#002).md), and did not take place without
difficulties and terrors, was accomplished, a series of years again
passed over, during which David always carried about with him the
thought of erecting God a Temple-building. And when he had received the
tidings through Nathan that he should not build God a house, but that it
should be done by his son and successor, he nevertheless did as much
towards the carrying out of the desire of his heart as was possible in
connection with this declaration of the will of Jahve. He consecrated
the site of the future Temple, he procured the necessary means and
materials for the building of it, he made all the necessary arrangements
for the future Temple-service, he inspirited the people for the gigantic
work of building that was before them, and handed over to his son the
model for it, as it is all related to us in detail by the chronicler.
The divine name "the mighty One of Jacob" is taken from [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md), as in [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024.md); [Isa
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026.md); [Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016.md). The Philistines with their
Dagon had been made to feel this mighty Rock of Jacob when they took the
sacred Ark along with them ([Sa1
5:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001).md). With אם David solemnly
declares what he is resolved not to do. The meaning of the
hyperbolically expressed vow in the form of an oath is that for so long
he will not rejoice at his own dwelling-house, nor give himself up to
sleep that is free from anxiety; in fine, for so long he will not rest.
The genitives after אהל and ערשׂ are appositional genitives; Ps 44
delights in similar combinations of synonyms. יצוּעי (Latin strata mea)
is a poetical plural, as also is משׁכּנות. With תּנוּמה (which is always
said of the eyelids, [Gen 31:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#040.md); [Pro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#004.md); [Ecc
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016), not of the eyes.md) alternates שׁנת
(according to another reading שׁנת) for שׁנה. The āth is the same as in
נחלת in [Psa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md), cf. 60:13, [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md), and frequently. This Aramaizing
rejection of the syllable before the tone is, however, without example
elsewhere. The lxx adds to [Psa 132:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#004.md),
καὶ ἀνάπαυσιν τοῖς κροτάφοις μου (וּמנוּחה לרקּותי), but this is a
disagreeable overloading of the verse.

[Psalms 132:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 132:6</span></span>

In [Psa 132:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md) begins the language of
the church, which in this Psalm reminds Jahve of His promises and
comforts itself with them. Olshausen regards this [Psa
132:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md) as altogether inexplicable. The
interpretation nevertheless has some safe starting-points. (1) Since the
subject spoken of is the founding of a fixed sanctuary, and one worthy
of Jahve, the suffix of שׁמענוּה (with Chateph as in [Hos
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#002), Ew. ֗60, a.md) and מצאנוּה refers to
the Ark of the covenant, which is fem. also in other instances ([Sa1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#017.md); [Ch2
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011)). (2.md) The Ark of the covenant,
fetched up out of Shiloh by the Israelites to the battle at Ebenezer,
fell into the hands of the victors, and remained, having been again
given up by them, for twenty years in Kirjath-Jearim ([Sa1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001)..md), until David removed it out of
this Judaean district to Zion ([Sa2
6:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md); cf. [Ch2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#004).md). What is then more natural than
that שׂדי־יער is a poetical appellation of Kirjath-Jearim (cf. "the
field of Zoan" in [Psa 78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012).md)?
Kirjath-Jearim has, as a general thing, very varying names. It is also
called Kirjath-ha-jearim in [Jer 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#020.md)
(Kirjath-'arim in [Ezr 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#025.md), cf. [Jos
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028).md), Kirjath-ba'al in [Jos
16:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md) :50, Ba'alah in [Jos
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009.md); [Ch1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006.md) (cf. Har-ha-ba'alah, [Jos
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#011.md), with Har-Jearim in [Jos
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010).md), and, as it seems, even Ba'al
Jehudah in [Sa2 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md). Why should it not
also have been called Ja'ar side by side with Kirjath-Jearim, and more
especially if the mountainous district, to which the mention of a hill
and mountain of Jearim points, was, as the name "city of the wood"
implies, at the same time a wooded district? We therefore fall in with
Khnl's (1799) rendering: we found it in the meadows of Jaar, and with
his remark: "Jaar is a shortened name of the city of Kirjath-Jearim."

The question now further arises as to what Ephrathah is intended to
mean. This is an ancient name of Bethlehem; but the Ark of the covenant
never was in Bethlehem. Accordingly Hengstenberg interprets, "We knew of
it in Bethlehem (where David had spent his youth) only by hearsay, no
one had seen it; we found it in Kirjath-Jearim, yonder in the wooded
environs of the city, where it was as it were buried in darkness and
solitude." So even Anton Hulsius (1650): Ipse David loquitur, qui dicit
illam ipsam arcam, de qua quum adhuc Bethlehemi versaretur inaudivisset,
postea a se (vel majroibus suis ipso adhuc minorenni) inventam fuisse in
campis Jaar. But (1) the supposition that David's words are continued
here does not harmonize with the way in which they are introduced in
[Psa 132:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#002.md), according to which they
cannot possibly extend beyond the vow that follows. (2) If the church is
speaking, one does not see why Bethlehem is mentioned in particular as
the place of the hearsay. (3) We heard it in Ephrathah cannot well mean
anything else than, per antiptosin (as in [Gen
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004), but without כּי.md), we heard that
it was in Ephrathah. But the Ark was before Kirjath-Jearim in Shiloh.
The former lay in the tribe of Judah close to the western borders of
Benjamin, the latter in the midst of the tribe of Ephraim. Now since
אפרתי quite as often means an Ephraimite as it does a Bethlehemite, it
may be asked whether Ephrathah is not intended of the Ephraimitish
territory (Khnl, Gesenius, Maurer, Tholuck, and others). The meaning
would then be: we had heard that the sacred Ark was in Shiloh, but we
found it not there, but in Kirjath-Jearim. And we can easily understand
why the poet has mentioned the two places just in this way. Ephrāth,
according to its etymon, is fruitful fields, with which are contrasted
the fields of the wood - the sacred Ark had fallen from its original,
more worthy abode, as it were, into the wilderness. But is it probable,
more especially in view of [Mic 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md),
that in a connection in which the memory of David is the ruling idea,
Ephrathah signifies the land of Ephraim? No, Ephrathah is the name of
the district in which Kirjath-Jearim lay. Caleb had, for instance, by
Ephrath, his third wife, a son named Hr (Chr), [Ch1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019.md), This Hr, the first-born of
Ephrathah, is the father of the population of Bethlehem ([Ch1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004).md), and Shobal, a son of this Hr, is
father of the population of Kirjath-Jearim ([Ch1
2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050).md). Kirjath-Jearim is therefore, so
to speak, the daughter of Bethlehem. This was called Ephrathah in
ancient times, and this name of Bethlehem became the name of its
district ([Mic 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001).md). Kirjath-Jearim
belonged to Caleb-Ephrathah ([Ch1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024).md), as the northern part of this
district seems to have been called in distinction from Negeb-Caleb ([Sa1
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014).md).

But משׁכּנותיו in [Psa 132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007.md) is now
neither a designation of the house of Abinadab in Kirjath-Jearim, for
the expression would be too grand, and in relation to [Psa
132:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#005.md) even confusing, nor a
designation of the Salomonic Temple-building, for the expression
standing thus by itself is not enough alone to designate it. What is
meant will therefore be the tent-temple erected by David for the Ark
when removed to Zion ([Sa2 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002.md),
יריעה). The church arouses itself to enter this, and to prostrate itself
in adoration towards (vid., [Psa 99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005).md)
the footstool of Jahve, i.e., the Ark; and to what purpose? The ark of
the covenant is now to have a place more worthy of it; the מנוּחה, i.e.,
the בּית מנוּחה, [Ch1 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md), in which
David's endeavours have through Solomon reached their goal, is erected:
let Jahve and the Ark of His sovereign power, that may not be touched
(see the examples of its inviolable character in [Sa1
5:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md), 1 Sam 6, [Sa2
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006)..md), now enter this fixed abode! Let
His priests who are to serve Him there clothe themselves in
"righteousness," i.e., in conduct that is according to His will and
pleasure; let His saints, who shall there seek and find mercy, shout for
joy! More especially, however, let Jahve for David's sake, His servant,
to whose restless longing this place of rest owes its origin, not turn
back the face of His anointed one, i.e., not reject his face which there
turns towards Him in the attitude of prayer (cf. [Psa
84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010).md). The chronicler has understood
[Psa 132:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010.md) as an intercession on
behalf of Solomon, and the situation into which we are introduced by
[Psa 132:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md) seems to require this. It
is, however, possible that a more recent poet here, in [Psa
132:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007.md), reproduces words taken from
the heart of the church in Solomon's time, and blends petitions of the
church of the present with them. The subject all through is the church,
which is ever identical although changing in the persons of its members.
The Israel that brought the sacred Ark out of Kirjath-Jearim to Zion and
accompanied it thence to the Temple-hill, and now worships in the
sanctuary raised by David's zeal for the glory of Jahve, is one and the
same. The prayer for the priests, for all the saints, and more
especially for the reigning king, that then resounded at the dedication
of the Temple, is continued so long as the history of Israel lasts, even
in a time when Israel has no king, but has all the stronger longing for
the fulfilment of the Messianic promise.

[Psalms 132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 132:11</span></span>

The "for the sake of David" is here set forth in detail. אמת in [Psa
132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md) is not the accusative of the
object, but an adverbial accusative. The first member of the verse
closes with לדוד, which has the distinctive Pazer, which is preceded by
Legarmeh as a sub-distinctive; then follows at the head of the second
member אמת with Zinnor, then לא־ישׁוּב ממּנּה with Olewejored and its
conjunctive Galgal, which regularly precedes after the sub-distinctive
Zinnor. The suffix of ממּנּה refers to that which was affirmed by oath,
as in [Jer 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028.md). Lineal descendants of
David will Jahve place on the throne (לכסּא like לראשׁי in [Psa
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004).md) to him, i.e., so that they shall
follow his as possessors of the throne. David's children shall for ever
(which has been finally fulfilled in Christ) sit לכסּא to him (cf. [Jer
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#005.md); [Jer
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007).md). Thus has Jahve promised, and
expects in return from the sons of David the observance of His Law.
Instead of עדתי זוּ it is pointed עדתי זו. In Hahn's edition עדתי has
Mercha in the penult. (cf. the retreat of the tone in זה אדני, [Dan
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#017).md), and in Baer's edition the
still better attested reading Mahpach instead of the counter-tone
Metheg, and Mercha on the ultima. It is not plural with a singular
suffix (cf. [Deu 28:59](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#059), Ges. 91, 3.md),
but, as זו = זאת indicates, the singular for עדוּתי, like תּחנתי for
תּחנוּתי in [Kg2 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008.md); and signifies
the revelation of God as an attestation of His will. אלמּדם has Mercha
mahpach., זו Rebia parvum, and עדתי Mercha; and according to the
interpunction it would have to be rendered: "and My self-attestation
there" (vid., on [Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016).md), but zow
is relative: My self-attestation (revelation), which I teach them. The
divine words extend to the end of [Psa
132:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#012.md). The hypotheses with אם, as the
fulfilment in history shows, were conditions of the continuity of the
Davidic succession; not, however - because human unfaithfulness does not
annul the faithfulness of God - of the endlessness of the Davidic
throne. In [Psa 132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md) the poet states
the ground of such promissory mercy. It is based on the universal mercy
of the election of Jerusalem. אוּהּ has He mappic. like ענּה in [Deu
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#029.md), or the stroke of Raphe (Ew.
247, d), although the suffix is not absolutely necessary. In the
following strophe the purport of the election of Jerusalem is also
unfolded in Jahve's own words.

[Psalms 132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 132:14</span></span>

Shiloh has been rejected ([Psa 78:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060).md),
for a time only was the sacred Ark in Bethel ([Jdg
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#027).md) and Mizpah ([Jdg
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005).md), only somewhat over twenty years
was it sheltered by the house of Abinadab in Kirjath-Jearim ([Sa1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002).md), only three months by the house
of Obed-Edom in Perez-uzzah ([Sa2
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#011).md) - but Zion is Jahve's abiding
dwelling-place, His own proper settlement, מנוּחה (as in [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md); [Isa
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md), and besides [Ch1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002).md). In Zion, His chosen and beloved
dwelling-place, Jahve blesses everything that belongs to her temporal
need (צידהּ for זידתהּ, vid., on [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005), note.md); so that her poor do not
suffer want, for divine love loves the poor most especially. His second
blessing refers to the priests, for by means of these He will keep up
His intercourse with His people. He makes the priesthood of Zion a real
institution of salvation: He clothes her priests with salvation, so that
they do not merely bring it about instrumentally, but personally possess
it, and their whole outward appearance is one which proclaims salvation.
And to all her saints He gives cause and matter for high and lasting
joy, by making Himself known also to the church, in which He has taken
up His abode, in deeds of mercy (loving-kindness or grace). There (שׁם,
[Psa 133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003).md) in Zion is indeed the
kingship of promise, which cannot fail of fulfilment. He will cause a
horn to shoot forth, He will prepare a lamp, for the house of David,
which David here represents as being its ancestor and the anointed one
of God reigning at that time; and all who hostilely rise up against
David in his seed, He will cover with shame as with a garment ([Job
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#022).md), and the crown consecrated by
promise, which the seed of David wears, shall blossom like an unfading
wreath. The horn is an emblem of defensive might and victorious
dominion, and the lamp (נר, [Sa2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#017.md), cf. ניר, [Ch2
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#007), lxx λύχνον.md) an emblem of
brilliant dignity and joyfulness. In view of [Eze
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#021.md), of the predictions concerning
the Branch (zemach) in [Isa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md); [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md); [Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015.md); [Zac
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md); [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012.md) (cf. [Heb
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014).md), and of the fifteenth Beracha of
the Shemone-Esre (the daily Jewish prayer consisting of eighteen
benedictions): "make the branch (zemach) of David Thy servant to shoot
forth speedily, and let his horn rise high by virtue of Thy salvation,"
- it is hardly to be doubted that the poet attached a Messianic meaning
to this promise. With reference to our Psalm, Zacharias, the father of
John the Baptist, changes that supplicatory beracha of his nation ([Luk
1:68-70](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068).md) into a praiseful one,
joyfully anticipating the fulfilment that is at hand in Jesus.
