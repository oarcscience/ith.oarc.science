### [Exodus Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 31:1</span></span>

The Builders (cf. Ex 35:30-36:1). - After having given directions for
the construction of the sanctuary, and all the things required for the
worship, Jehovah pointed out the builders, whom He had called to carry
out the work, and had filled with His Spirit for that purpose. To "call
by name" is to choose or appoint by name for a particular work (cf. [Isa
45:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#003).md). Bezaleel was a grandson of
Hur, of the tribe of Judah, who is mentioned in [Exo
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#010.md); [Exo
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#014.md), and was called to be the
master-builder, to superintend the whole of the building and carry out
the artistic work; consequently he is not only invariably mentioned
first ([Exo 35:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030.md); [Exo
36:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001).md), but in the accounts of the
execution of the separate portions he is mentioned alone ([Exo
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#001.md); [Exo
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#022).md). Filling with the Spirit of God
signifies the communication of an extraordinary and supernatural
endowment and qualification, "in wisdom," etc., i.e., consisting of
wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and every kind of workmanship, that is
to say, for the performance of every kind of work. This did not preclude
either natural capacity or acquired skill, but rather presupposed them;
for in [Exo 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#006.md) it is expressly
stated in relation to his assistants, that God had put wisdom into all
that were wise-hearted (see at [Exo
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#003).md). Being thus endowed with a
supernaturally exalted gift, Bezaleel was qualified "to think out
inventions," i.e., ideas or artistic designs. Although everything had
been minutely described by Jehovah, designs and plans were still needed
in carrying out the work, so that the result should correspond to the
divine instructions.

[Exodus 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 31:6</span></span>

There were associated with Bezaleel as assistants, Oholiab, the son of
Achisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and other men endowed with
understanding, whom God had filled with wisdom for the execution of His
work. According to [Exo 38:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#023.md), Oholiab
was both faber, a master in metal, stone, and wood work, and also an
artistic weaver of colours. In [Exo
38:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#007.md), the words to be executed,
which have been minutely described in ch. 24-30, are mentioned singly
once more; and, in addition to these, we find in [Exo
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#010.md) השּׂרד בּגדי mentioned, along
with, or rather before, the holy dress of Aaron. This is the case also
in [Exo 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#019.md) and [Exo
39:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#041.md), where there is also the
additional clause, "to serve (שׁרת ministrare) in the sanctuary." They
were composed, according to [Exo 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md),
of blue and red purple, and crimson. The meaning of the word serad,
which only occurs in these passages, is quite uncertain. The Rabbins
understand by the bigde hasserad the wrappers in which the vessels of
the sanctuary were enclosed when the camp was broken up, as these are
called begadim of blue and red purple, and crimson, in [Num
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#006.md). But this rendering is opposed to
the words which follow, and which indicate their use in the holy
service, i.e., in the performance of worship, and therefore are quite
inapplicable to the wrappers referred to. There is even less ground for
referring them, as Gesenius and others do, to the inner curtains of the
tabernacle, or the inner hangings of the dwelling-place. For, apart from
the uncertainty of the rendering given to serad, viz., netted cloth,
filet, it is overthrown by the fact that these curtains of the
dwelling-place were not of net-work; and still more decisively by the
order in which the bigde hasserad occur in [Exo
39:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#041.md), viz., not till the
dwelling-place and tent, and everything belonging to them, have been
mentioned, even down to the hangings of the court and the pegs of the
tent, and all that remains to be noticed is the clothing of the priests.
From the definition "to serve in the sanctuary," it is obvious that the
bigde serad were clothes used in the worship, στολαὶ λειτουργικαί, as
the lxx have rendered it in agreement with the rest of the ancient
versions-that they were, in fact, the rich robes which constituted the
official dress of the high priest, whilst "the holy garments for Aaron"
were the holy clothes which were worn by him in common with the priests.

[Exodus 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 31:12</span></span>

(cf. [Exo 35:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#002).md). God concludes by
enforcing the observance of His Sabbaths in the most solemn manner,
repeating the threat of death and extermination in the case of every
transgressor. The repetition and further development of this command,
which was included already in the decalogue, is quite in its proper
place here, inasmuch as the thought might easily have occurred, that it
was allowable to omit the keeping of the Sabbath, when the execution of
so great a work in honour of Jehovah had been commanded. "My Sabbaths:"
by these we are to understand the weekly Sabbaths, not the other
sabbatical festivals, since the words which follow apply to the weekly
Sabbath alone. This was "a sign between Jehovah and Israel for all
generations, to know (i.e., by which Israel might learn) that it was
Jehovah who sanctified them," viz., by the sabbatical rest (see at [Exo
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#011).md). It was therefore a holy thing
for Israel ([Exo 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014).md), the
desecration of which would be followed by the punishment of death, as a
breach of the covenant. The kernel of the Sabbath commandment is
repeated in [Exo 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#015.md); the seventh
day of the week, however, is not simply designated a "Sabbath," but
שׁבּתון שׁבּת "a high Sabbath" (the repetition of the same word, or of
an abstract form of the concrete noun, denoting the superlative; see
Ges. 113, 2), and "holy to Jehovah" (see at [Exo
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#023).md). For this reason Israel was to
keep it in all future generations, i.e., to observe it as an eternal
covenant ([Exo 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#016).md), as in the case
of circumcision, since it was to be a sign for ever between Jehovah and
the children of Israel ([Eze 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#020).md).
The eternal duration of this sign was involved in the signification of
the sabbatical rest, which is pointed out in [Exo
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#011.md), and reaches forward into
eternity.

[Exodus 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 31:18</span></span>

When Moses had received all the instructions respecting the sanctuary to
be erected, Jehovah gave him the two tables of testimony-tables of
stone, upon which the decalogue was written with the finger of God. It
was to receive these tables that he had been called up the mountain
([Exo 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012).md). According to [Exo
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#016.md), the tables themselves, as well
as the writing, were the work of God; and the writing was engraved upon
them (חרוּת from חרת = χαράττειν), and the tables were written on both
their sides ([Exo 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015).md). Both the
choice of stone as the material for the tables, and the fact that the
writing was engraved, were intended to indicate the imperishable
duration of these words of God. The divine origin of the tables, as well
as of the writing, corresponded to the direct proclamation of the ten
words to the people from the summit of the mountain by the mouth of God.
As this divine promulgation was a sufficient proof that they were the
immediate word of God, unchanged by the mouth and speech of man, so the
writing of God was intended to secure their preservation in Israel as a
holy and inviolable thing. The writing itself was not a greater miracle
than others, by which God has proved Himself to be the Lord of nature,
to whom all things that He has created are subservient for the
establishment and completion of His kingdom upon earth; and it can
easily be conceived of without the anthropomorphic supposition of a
material finger being possessed by God. Nothing is said about the
dimensions of the tables: at the same time, we can hardly imagine them
to have been as large as the inside of the ark; for stone slab 2 1/2
cubits long and 1 1/2 cubits broad, which must necessarily have been
some inches in thickness to prevent their breaking in the hand, would
have required the strength of Samson to enable Moses to carry them down
the mountain "in his hand" ([Exo
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015).md), or even "in his two hands"
([Deu 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#015.md), [Deu
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#017).md). But if we suppose them to have
been smaller than this, say at the most a cubit and a half long and one
cubit broad, there would have been plenty of room on the four sides for
the 172 words contained in the decalogue, with its threats and promises
(Ex 20:2-17), without the writing being excessively small.
