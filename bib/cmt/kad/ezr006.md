### [Ezra Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 6:1</span></span>

The decision of Darius. - [Ezr 6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md).
At the command of Darius, search was made in the archives of the royal
treasury; and in the fortress of Achmetha in Media, was found the roll
in which was recorded the edict published by Cyrus, concerning the
building of the temple at Jerusalem.

[Ezr 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md)

Search was made in the house of the books where also the treasures were
deposited in Babylon. מהחתין, partic. Aphel of נחת; see [Ezr
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#015.md).

[Ezr 6:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#002.md)

"And there was found at Achmetha, in the fortress that is in the land of
Media, a roll; and thus was it recorded therein." In Babylon itself the
document sought for was not found; though, probably the search there
made, led to the discovery of a statement that documents pertaining to
the time of Cyrus were preserved in the fortress of Achmetha, where the
record in question was subsequently discovered. אחמתא, the capital of
Great Media - τὰ Εκβάτανα, Judith 1:1, 14, or Ἀγβάτανα (Herod. i. 98) -
built by Dejokes, was the summer residence of the Persian and Parthian
kings, and situate in the neighbourhood of the modern Hamadan. Achmetha
is probably the Old-Median or Old-Persian pronunciation of the name, the
letters אחם on Sassanidian coins being explained as denoting this city
(Mordtmann in the Zeitschrift der deutsch morgenl. Gesellschaft, viii.
p. 14). The citadel of Ecbatana probably contained also the royal palace
and the official buildings. For בּגוּהּ is found in some MSS and
editions בּגוּהּ; but Norzi and J. H. Mich. have Pathach under ו as the
better authorized reading. דּכרונה, stat. emph. of דּכרון, memorandum,
ὑπόμνημα, a record of anything memorable. The contents of this document
follow, [Ezr 6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#003.md). First, the
proclamation of King Cyrus in the first year of his reign: "The house of
God at Jerusalem, let this house be built as a place where sacrifices
are offered." The meaning of the words following is doubtful. We
translate מסובלין ואשּׁוחי: and let them raise up its foundations, i.e.,
its foundations are to be again raised up, restored. אשּׁין, foundations
([Ezr 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012).md); מסובלין, part. Poel of
סבל, to carry, to raise (not to be raised). סבל often stands for the
Hebrew נשׂא, to carry, to raise up, to erect; compare the Samaritan
translation of [Gen 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md) : וסבל את
עגין, he lifted up his eyes. סובל אשּׁין analogous with מוסדי ד קומם,
[Isa 58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012.md), and signifies to erect
buildings upon the foundations.

(Note: The Vulgate, following a rabbinical explanation, has ponant
fundamenta supportantia, which is here unsuitable. The conjecture of
Bertheau, who labours, by all sorts of critical combinations of the
letters in the words מסובלין ואשּׁוחי, to produce the text תמנים מאה
אמין אשוהי, "its foundation length 180 cubits," is as needless as it is
mistaken. The interpretation of the words in the lxx, καὶ ἔθηκεν ἔπαρμα,
and Pseudo-Ezra 6, διὰ πυρός ἐνδελεχους, are nothing else than unmeaning
suppositions.)

Expositors are divided as to the dimensions of the new temple, "its
height 60 cubits, and its breadth 60 cubits," Antiq. xi. 4. 6; while
Solomon's temple was but 30 cubits high, and, without the
side-buildings, only 20 cubits broad. We nevertheless consider the
statements correct, and the text incorrupt, and explain the absence of
the measure of length simply by the fact that, as far as length was
concerned, the old and new temples were of equal dimensions. Solomon's
temple, measured externally, inclusive of the porch and the additional
building at the hinder part, was about 100 cubits long (see the ground
plan in my bibl. Archaeol. Table II. fig. 1). To correspond with this
length, the new temple was, according to the desire of Cyrus, to be both
higher and broader, viz., 60 cubits high, and as many wide, -
measurements which certainly apply to external dimensions. Zerubbabel's
temple, concerning the structure of which we have no further
particulars, was externally of this height and breadth. This may be
inferred from the speech of King Herod in Joseph. Ant. xv. 11. 1, in
which this tyrant, who desired to be famous for the magnificence of his
buildings, endeavoured to gain the favour of the people for the
rebuilding of the temple, which he was contemplating, by the remark that
the temple built by their forefathers, on their return from the
Babylonian captivity, was 60 cubits too low, - Solomon's temple having
been double that height (sc. according to the height given in [Ch2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004), 120 cubits.md) - and from the fact
that Herod made his temple 100 or 120 cubits high. Hence the temple of
Zerubbabel, measured externally, must have been 60 cubits high; and
consequently we need not diminish the breadth of 60 cubits, also given
in this verse, by alterations of the text, because Herod's temple was
likewise of this width, but must understand the given dimensions to
relate to external height and breadth. For in Herod's temple the holy
places were but 60 cubits high and 20 wide; the holy place, 40 cubits
long, 20 wide, and 60 high; the holy of holies, 20 cubits long, 20 wide,
and 60 high. And we may assume that the dimensions of Zerubbabel's
temple preserved the same proportions, with perhaps the modification,
that the internal height did not amount to 60 cubits, - an upper storey
being placed above the holy place and the holy of holies, as in Herod's
temple; which would make the internal height of these places amount to
only about 30 or 40 cubits.

(Note: While we acknowledge it possible that the holy and most holy
places, measured within, may have been only 40 cubits high, we cannot
admit the objection of H. Merz, in Herzog's Realencycl. xv. p. 513, that
20 cubits of internal breadth is an inconceivable proportion to 60
cubits, this being the actual proportion in Herod's temple, as Merz
himself states, p. 516, without finding it in this instance
"inconceivable.")

In like manner must the 60 cubits of breadth be so divided, that the 5
cubits internal breadth of the side-buildings of Solomon's temple must
be enlarged to 10, which, allowing 5 cubits of thickness for the walls,
would make the entire building 60 cubits wide (5 + 10 + 5 + 20 + 5 + 10
+ 5).

(Note: The conjecture of Merz in his above-cited article, and of
Bertheau, that the dimensions of Zerubbabel's temple were double those
of Solomon's, - viz. the holy and most holy places 40 cubits high and 40
wide, the upper chambers 20 cubits high, the side-chambers each 10
cubits high, and the whole building 120 cubits long, - must be rejected
as erroneous, by the consideration that Herod's temple was only the
length of Solomon's, viz., 100 cubits, of which the holy of holies took
up 20, the holy place 40, the porch 10, the additional building behind
10, and the four walls 20. For Herod would by no means have diminished
the length of his building 20, or properly 40 cubits. We also see, from
the above-named dimensions, that the 60 cubits broad cannot be
understood of internal breadth.)

The statement in [Ezr 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#004.md), "three
layers of great stones, and a layer of new timber," is obscure. נדבּך
means row, layer, and stands in the Targums for the Hebrew טוּר, "used
of a layer of bricks;" see Gesen. Thes. p. 311, and Levy, chald.
Wrterbuch, ii. p. 93. גּלל אבן, stone of rolling, one that is rolled and
cannot be carried, i.e., a great building stone. חדת, novus, as an
epithet to אע, is remarkable, it being self-evident that new wood is
generally used for a new building. The lxx translates εἷς, reading the
word חדה ([Ezr 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#003).md). This statement
involuntarily recalls the notice, [Kg1
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036.md), that Solomon built the inner
court, ארזים כּרתת וטוּר גזית טוּרי שׁלשׁה; hence Merz expresses the
supposition that "this is certainly a fragment, forming the conclusion
of the whole design of the building, which, like that in [Kg1
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036.md), ends with the porch and the
walls of the fore-court," Thus much only is certain, that the words are
not to be understood, as by Fritzsche on 1 Esdr. 6:25, as stating that
the temple walls were built of "three layers of large stones, upon which
was one layer of beams," and therefore were not massive; such kind of
building never being practised in the East in old times. "And let the
expenses be given out of the king's house." This is more precisely
stated in [Ezr 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#008.md) of the royal
revenues on this side the river. נפקא the expense (from נפק, Aphel, to
expend), therefore the cost of building.

[Ezr 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#005.md)

"And also let the vessels ... be restored, and brought again to the
temple at Jerusalem, to their place, and (thou) shalt place them in the
house of God." On the matter of this verse, comp. [Ezr
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007.md) and [Ezr
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#014.md). The sing. יהך (comp. [Ezr
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#005)) is distributive: it (each vessel.md)
to its place. ותחת (comp. אחת [Ezr
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#015).md) cannot, according to the sense,
be third pers. fem. (neutr.), but only second pers. imperf. Aphel: thou
shalt place. None but Sheshbazzar can be addressed ([Ezr
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#015).md), though he is not named in [Ezr
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#003.md). The historian is evidently not
giving the contents of the document word for word, but only its
essential matter; hence he infers the address to Sheshbazzar from the
answer of the Jewish elders ([Ezr
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#015).md). Perhaps it was also remarked in
the document, that Coresh caused the sacred vessels to be delivered to
Sheshbazzar ([Ezr 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008).md).

[Ezr 6:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#006.md)

Acting upon the discovered edict, Darius warned the governor and royal
officials on this side the Euphrates, not to hinder the building of the
house of God at Jerusalem. On the contrary, they were to promote it by
furnishing what was necessary for the work, and paying the expenses of
the building out of the royal revenues to the elders of the Jews ([Ezr
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#006).md). They were also to provide for
the worship of God in this temple such animals as the priests should
require for sacrifice ([Ezr 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#009.md), [Ezr
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010).md), under pain of severe punishment
for transgressing this command as also for any injury done to the temple
([Ezr 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#011.md), [Ezr
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#012).md). This decree was undoubtedly
communicated to the governor in the form of a written answer to his
inquiries ([Ezr 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#013).md). Without,
however, expressly stating this to be the case, as [Ezr
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md) and [Ezr
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#017.md) would lead us to expect, the
historian gives us in [Ezr 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#006.md). the
actual contents of the royal edict, and that in the form of a direct
injunction to the governor and his associates on this side the river:
"Now Tatnai, governor, ... be ye far from thence." The suffix וּכנותהון,
and their associates, is indeed unsuitable to the form of an address, of
which Tatnai and Shethar-Boznai are the subjects; the narrator, however,
in using it, had in mind the title or introduction of the royal letter.
On this matter, comp. [Ezr 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006.md). רחק
and רחיק, to be far from, figuratively to keep from anything, e.g., from
good, [Psa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002.md). מן־תּמּה, from
thence, from Jerusalem; in other words, trouble yourselves no longer,
as, according to [Ezr 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md), you have
done about what is being done there.

[Ezr 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#007.md)

"Let the work of the house of God alone." שׁבק with an accusative, to
leave anything, to let it go on without hindrance. "Let the Pechah of
the Jews (Sheshbazzar, Zerubbabel) and the elders of the Jews build this
house of God in its place." The ל to לשׂבי introduces a second subject
with special emphasis: And as far as regards the elders of the Jews,
i.e., the Pechah, and especially the elders.

[Ezr 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#008.md)

"And a decree is (hereby) made by me, what ye shall do to these elders
of the Jews, i.e., how you shall behave towards them (עם עבד = עם עשׂה,
[Gen 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#012)..md), to build this house,
i.e., that this house may be built: namely, (ו expl.) of the royal
moneys, of the custom (מדּה, see remarks on [Ezr
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#013).md) on this side the river, let
expenses (the cost of building) be punctually given to these men, that
there be no hindrance." לבטּלא דּי־לא, that there be no cessation or
leisure from work, i.e., that the work is not to be discontinued. On the
construction of the לא with the following infinitive, comp. [Dan
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#009.md). The Vulgate renders the sense
correctly by ne impediatur opus.

[Ezr 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#009.md)

"And what is needful, both young bullocks and rams and lambs, for the
burnt-offerings of the God of leaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil,
according to the word of the priests at Jerusalem (i.e., as the priests
shall require for the service of God), let it be given them day by day
without fail." מה is joined with the plur. fem. of the partic. חשׁחן,
and is defined by the enumeration which follows. משׁח, properly the
anointing, then oil as the means of anointing. On להוא and להון, see
remarks on [Ezr 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012.md). שׁלוּ דּי־לא,
that there be no failure.

[Ezr 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010.md)

The end the king had in view in all this follows: "That they (the
priests) may offer sacrifices well-pleasing to the God of heaven, and
pray for the life of the king and of his sons." ניחוחין (comp. [Dan
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#046).md) are sacrifices agreeable to God,
ניחוחין ריח ([Lev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md), [Lev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#013), and elsewhere.md), i.e., sacrifices
pleasing to God. Cyrus had commanded the rebuilding of the temple at
Jerusalem, because he acknowledged the God of Israel to be the God of
heaven, who had given him the kingdoms of the earth ([Ezr
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002).md). Darius was treading in his
footsteps by also owning the God of the Jews as the God of heaven, and
desiring that the blessing of this God might rest upon himself and his
dynasty. Such an acknowledgment it was possible for the Persian kings to
make without a renunciation of their polytheism. They could honour Jahve
as a mighty, nay, as the mightiest God of heaven, without being
unfaithful to the gods of their fathers; while the Jews could also, in
the interest of their own welfare, pray and offer sacrifices in the
temple of the Lord for the life of the king to whom God had caused them
to be subject (comp. [Jer 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007).md).
Accordingly we find that in after times sacrifices were regularly
offered for the king on appointed days: comp. 1 Macc. 7:33, 12:11; 2
Macc. 3:35, 13:23; Joseph. Antiq. xii. 2. 5, and elsewhere.

[Ezr 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#011.md)

To inculcate obedience to his command, Darius threatens to punish its
transgression with death: "If any one alters this command, let a beam be
torn from his house, and let him be fastened hanging thereon." To alter
a command means to transgress or abolish it. אע, a piece of wood, a
beam. זקיף, raised on high, is in Syriac the usual word for crucified,
and is to be so understood here. מחא, to strike, with על, strike upon,
fasten to, nail to. This kind of capital punishment was customary among
the Assyrians (Diod. Sic. ii. 1), the ancient Persians, and many other
nations, but seems to have been executed in different manners among
different people. Among the Assyrians it generally consisted in the
impalement of the delinquent upon a sharp strong wooden post; comp.
Layard, Nineveh and Babylon, p. 355, and Nineveh and its Remains, p.
379, with the illustration fig. 58. According to Herod. iii. 159, Darius
impaled as many as 3000 Babylonians after the capture of their city
(ἀνεσκολόπισε). Crucifixion proper, however, i.e., nailing to a cross,
also occurred among the Persians; it was, however, practised by nailing
the body of the criminal to a cross after decapitation; see the passages
from Herodotus in Brissonii de regio Persarum princip. l. ii. c. 215.
"And let his house be made a dunghill." See remarks on [Dan
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#005.md) and [Kg2
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#027.md).

[Ezr 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#012.md)

Finally, Darius adds the threat: "The God who has caused His name to
dwell there, destroy every king and (every) people that shall stretch
forth the hand to alter (this command), to destroy this house of God at
Jerusalem." The expression, "the God who has caused His name to dwell
there," is indeed specifically Israelitish (comp. [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md); [Deu
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#023.md); [Jer
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012.md); [Neh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#009).md), and therefore undoubtedly
originated with the Jewish historian; but the matter itself, the wish
that God Himself would destroy him who should injure His temple, recalls
the close of the inscription of Bisitun, wherein the judgments of
Ahuramazda are imprecated upon him who should dare to injure the image
and inscription, and his blessing invoked upon him who should respect
them (Berth.).

[Ezra 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 6:13</span></span>

The execution of the royal decree, the completion of the building, and
the dedication of the new temple. - [Ezr
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#013.md) Tatnai and his associate
diligently executed the commands of Darius. "Because Darius the king
sent (i.e., despatched to them the letter, whose contents have just been
given, [Ezr 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#006).md), they speedily acted
accordingly in the manner stated" (כּנמא).

[Ezr 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014.md)

The elders of the Jews, moreover, built, and they prospered through the
prophesying of Haggai and Zechariah, who thereby effected the resumption
of the work, and promised them success. ב is used of the rule by which,
or manner in which anything is done. "They built and finished (the
building) according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and
according to the command of Cyrus, Darius, and Artachshasta, kings of
Persia." The naming of Artachshasta presents some difficulty; for since
it is impossible to conceive that a predecessor of Darius is intended by
a name which follows the name of that monarch, none but Artaxerxes
Longimanus can be meant, and he did not reign till long after the
completion of the temple. Cleric. and J. H. Mich. explain the mention of
his name by the consideration that Artaxerxes, by his edict ([Ezr
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#015.md), [Ezr
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#021).md), contributed to the maintenance,
though not to the building, of the temple.

(Note: "Nam etsi," remarks Calovius in J. H. Mich., adnotatt. uber. ad
h. l., "non ad structuram templi conduxerit proprie edictum Artaxerxis,
quae Darii secundo anno incepta et sexto absoluta fuit, [Ezr
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#015.md) ad ornamenta tamen et additamenta
eam spectasse dubium non est: quae ab ipso, ceu rege post Cyrum et
Darium erga Judaeos Persarum omnium benignissimo, profecta hic
celebratur." Similarly but more briefly explained by Clericus.)

It may in this instance be questionable whether the name ארתחשׁשׁתא was
added by the author of the Chaldee section, or by Ezra when he
introduced this into his book. We believe the latter to be the correct
view, because the Chaldee section, to judge by the אמרנא, [Ezr
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004.md), was composed by one who lived
contemporaneously with the building of the temple, while from the date
of the completion of the temple to the seventh year of Artaxerxes
fifty-seven years elapsed.

[Ezr 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#015.md)

And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar (the
twelfth month), which is the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
שׁיציא, according to the Keri שׁיצי, with the א dropped, is the Shaphel
of יצא, to bring a thing to an end, to finish it. The form שׁיציא is not
a participle pass. formed from the Shaphel (Gesen.), for this would be
משׁיציא, but a Hebraized passive form of the Shaphel in the meaning of
the Targumistic Ishtaphal, like חיתיוּ, [Dan
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#013.md), and חיתית, [Dan
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#018.md), with the active היתיו, [Dan
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#017.md). In the Targums שׁיצי has mostly
an active, and only in a few passages the intransitive meaning, to end,
to be at the end; comp. Levy, chald. Wrterbuch, s.v.

(Note: Instead of the "third day," which the lxx also has, in accordance
with the Hebrew text, 1 Esdr. 7:5 gives the three-and-twentieth day of
the month Adar, - a statement which Bertheau arbitrarily insists upon
regarding as the original reading, because "the view that the compiler
altered the third into the twenty-third day, because it seemed to him
more fitting to assume an eight days' celebration of the dedication
(comp. [Kg1 8:60](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#060.md); [Ch2
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#018).md), and to fill up therewith also
the eight last days of the year, is rather far-fetched." Such a view,
however, would be entirely consistent with the whole spirit of 1
Esdras.)

[Ezr 6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#016.md)

The sons of Israel, more exactly the priests and the Levites, and the
rest of the sons of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of
God with joy. חנכּה עבד = the Hebrew חנכּה עשׂה, to celebrate the
dedication ([Ch2 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#009).md). בּחדוה, Hebrew
בּשׂמחה; see [Neh 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010.md). They brought
for the dedication a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred
lambs as burnt-offerings, and twelve he-goats for a sin-offering for all
Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, because the
temple was intended for the entire covenant people, whose return to the
Lord and to the land of their fathers, according to the predictions of
the prophets, was hoped for (comp. e.g., [Eze
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015.md)., [Jer
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#027)..md), not, as older expositors
thought, because certain families of the ten tribes, who had before
settled in Judah, were also among those who returned (J. H. Mich. ad h.
l.).

[Ezr 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#018.md)

At the same time, the priests and Levites were appointed, according to
their classes and divisions, to the service of the temple, that they
might henceforth fulfil their office, each class in its week ([Ch2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#004.md); [Kg2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#009).md). והקימוּ corresponds with the
Hebrew ויּעמידוּ, [Ezr 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md), and
elsewhere. As Bertheau justly remarks, "The services of public worship,
which after the completion of the temple were to be performed by the
priests and Levites, according to ancient ordinance, are here spoken
of." With these words the Chaldee section closes.

[Ezra 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ezr 6:19</span></span>

Celebration of the feast of the passover, and of the feast of unleavened
bread, in the year following the dedication, as an historical testimony
to the fact that the worship of God with its festivals was regularly
carried on in the new temple.

[Ezr 6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#019.md)

The feast of the passover, on the fourteenth day of the first month,
took place only a few weeks after the dedication of the temple. The
reason given in [Ezr 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#020.md) - for the
priests and Levites had purified themselves without exception (כּאחד,
like [Ezr 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#009).md); they were all clean,
and they killed the passover for all the sons of the captivity (i.e.,
the laity who had returned from exile), and for their brethren the
priests, and for themselves - has in this connection the meaning: Then
the congregation celebrated the passover, and they were able to keep and
to eat the passover, because the priests had purified themselves that
they might be qualified for performing the office incumbent upon them of
sprinkling the blood; and the Levites were also clean, that they might
be able to kill the lambs for the whole congregation (comp. the remarks
on [Ch2 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#017.md), etc., and [Ch2
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#011.md), [Ch2
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#014).md). From the days of Josiah, it
seems to have been customary for the Levites to take the place of the
heads of families ([Exo 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006), etc..md) in
slaughtering the passover lambs for the whole community, both priesthood
and laity: for the laity, that no person who was unclean might kill the
paschal lamb; for the priests, that their labours might be lightened,
the sprinkling of blood and the offering of sacrifices occupying them
far into the night ([Ch2 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#011.md), [Ch2
35:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#014).md). And this custom was
followed at this time also. The priests are called אחיהם, brethren of
the Levites, as in [Ch2 29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md); [Ch2
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015.md).

[Ezr 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#021.md)

Thus the sons of Israel who had returned from captivity, and all that
had separated themselves unto them from the uncleanness of the heathen
of the country to seek Jahve the God of Israel, could eat the passover.
הארץ גּויי = הארץ עמּי, [Ezr 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#002.md),
[Ezr 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#011.md), are the heathen races
dwelling in Palestine. The expression is not essentially different from
הארצות עמּי, [Ezr 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md)., [Ezr
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003.md), and is only distinguishable
therefrom, inasmuch as the latter appellation includes not merely the
heathen inhabitants of Palestine, but also the heathen of other lands,
as the Moabites, Ammonites, Egyptians, etc. ([Ezr
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001)..md). Those who had separated
themselves from the uncleanness of the heathen to them (the Jews) to
seek Jahve, are not proselytes from heathenism (Aben Ezra, Rashi,
Clericus, and others), but Israelites, who had till now lived in
Palestine, and mingled with the heathen inhabitants of the land. They
were descended from those Israelites whom the kings of Assyria and
Babylon had not carried away from the realms of Israel and Judah, and
who with respect to religion had combined heathenism and the worship of
Jahve ([Kg2 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#032), etc..md), and thus
defiled themselves with heathen impurity, but who now, after the
erection of the temple, joined themselves to the new community, for the
purpose of worshipping with them the God of their fathers in His temple,
according to the law of Moses. For, as Bertheau rightly remarks, "in the
days of Ezra the princes of the new community complain that the laity,
the priests, and Levites do not separate from the people of the lands
([Ezr 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001).md); reference is made to the
dangers which threaten the Israelites, because they dwell in the holy
land among the unclean ([Ezr 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#010).md). To
separate from the uncleanness of the nations means to renounce
intermarriage and other connection with them. [Ezr
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#002.md), [Ezr
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#010.md). They are Israelites who are
summoned, [Ezr 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#011.md), to separate from
the peoples of the land; the seed of Israel is, in [Neh
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#002.md), separated from the sons of the
stranger, and in [Neh 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029.md) they who
separate from them are evidently Israelites, for, when they bind
themselves to walk according to the law of God, they are said to join
their brethren, i.e., their fellow-countrymen." Hence in this passage
also we cannot but regard those who separated themselves as Israelites,
dissolving their connection with the heathen for the sake of the God of
Israel.

[Ezr 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022.md)

Hereupon they kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with
joy; for the Lord had made them joyful, and turned to them (i.e., had
made them joyful by turning to them) the heart of the king of Assyria.
With regard to the expression, comp. [Ch2
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#027.md); [Neh
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#043.md). The king of Assur is the
Persian king Darius, who as ruler of the former realm of Assyria is thus
designated. The turning of this king's heart to them consisted in this,
that their hands were strengthened for the work of the house of God,
i.e., that through the goodwill of the king they were enabled to
complete the building of their temple, and to restore the worship of the
God of Israel. On בּ ידיהם חזּק, comp. [Sa1
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019.md).
