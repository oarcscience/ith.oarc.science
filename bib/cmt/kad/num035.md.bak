### [Numbers Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 35:1</span></span>

Appointment of Towns for the Levites. - As the Levites were to receive
no inheritance of their own, i.e., no separate tribe-territory, in the
land of Canaan ([Num 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md) and [Num
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#023).md), Moses commanded the children
of Israel, i.e., the rest of the tribes, in accordance with the divine
instructions, to give (vacate) towns to the Levites to dwell in of the
inheritance that fell to them for a possession, with pasturage by the
cities round about them for their cattle. "Towns to dwell in," i.e., not
the whole of the towns as their own property, but as many houses in the
towns as sufficed for the necessities of the Levites as their hereditary
possession, which could be redeemed, if sold at any time, and which
reverted to them without compensation in the year of jubilee, even if
not redeemed before ([Lev 25:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#032).md);
but any portion of the towns which was not taken possession of by them,
together with the fields and villages, continued the property of those
tribes to which they had been assigned by lot (cf. [Jos
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#012.md), and my commentary on this
passage: also Bhr, Symbolik, ii. p. 50; Ewald, Gesch. ii. p. 403). They
were also to give them מגרשׁ (from גּרשׁ, to drive, drive out),
pasturage or fields, to feed their flocks upon, all round the cities;
and according to [Lev 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#034.md), this was
not to be sold, but to remain the eternal possession of the Levites.
לבהמתּם, for their oxen and beasts of burden, and לרכוּשׁם, for their
(remaining) possessions in flocks (sheep and goats), which are generally
described in other cases as Mikneh, in distinction from behemah (e.g.,
[Num 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#026.md); [Gen
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#023.md); [Gen
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006).md). לכל־חיּתם and for all their
animals, is merely a generalizing summary signifying all the animals
which they possessed.

[Numbers 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 35:4</span></span>

The pasture lands of the different towns were to measure "from the town
wall outwards a thousand cubits round about," i.e., on each of the four
sides. "And measure from without the city, the east side 2000 cubits,
and the south side 2000 cubits, and the west side 2000 cubits, and the
north side 2000 cubits, and the city in the middle," i.e., so that the
town stood in the middle of the measured lines, and the space which they
occupied was not included in the 2000 cubits. The meaning of these
instructions, which have caused great perplexity to commentators, and
have latterly been explained by Saalschtz (Mos. R. pp. 100, 101) in a
marvellously erroneous manner, was correctly expounded by J. D.
Michaelis in the notes to his translation. We must picture the towns and
the surrounding fields as squares, the pasturage as stretching 1000
cubits from the city wall in every direction, as the accompanying
figures show, and the length of each outer side as 2000 cubits, apart
from the length of the city wall: so that, if the town itself occupied a
square of 1000 cubits (see fig. a), the outer side of the town fields
would measure 2000 + 1000 cubits in every direction; but if each side of
the city wall was only 500 cubits long (see fig. b), the outer side of
the town fields would measure 2000 + 500 cubits in every direction.

[Numbers 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 35:6</span></span>

Of these cities which were given up to the Levites, six were to serve as
cities of refuge (see at [Num 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#012).md)
for manslayers, and in addition to these (עליהם, over upon them) the
Israelites were to give of their possessions forty-two others, that is
to say, forty-eight in all; and they were to do this, giving much from
every tribe that had much, and little from the one which had little
([Num 26:54](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#054).md). With the accusatives
הערים את and ערי שׁשׁ עת ([Num 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#006).md),
the writer has already in his mind the verbs תּרבּוּ and תּמעיטוּ of
[Num 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#008.md), where he takes up the
object again in the word והערים. According to Josh 21, the Levites
received nine cities in the territory of Judah and Simeon, four in the
territory of each of the other tribes, with the exception of Naphtali,
in which there were only three, that is to say, ten in the land to the
east of the Jordan, and thirty-eight in Canaan proper, of which the
thirteen given up by Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin were assigned to the
families of the priests, and the other thirty-five to the three
Levitical families. This distribution of the Levites among all the
tribes - by which the curse of division and dispersion in Israel, which
had been pronounced upon Levi in Jacob's blessing ([Gen
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007).md), was changed into a blessing
both for the Levites themselves and also for all Israel - was in perfect
accordance with the election and destination of this tribe. Called out
of the whole nation to be the peculiar possession of Jehovah, to watch
over His covenant, and teach Israel His rights and His law ([Deu
33:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md); [Lev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011.md); [Deu
31:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#009).md), the Levites were to form and
set forth among all the tribes the ἐκλογή of the nation of Jehovah's
possession, and by their walk as well as by their calling to remind the
Israelites continually of their own divine calling; to foster and
preserve the law and testimony of the Lord in Israel, and to awaken and
spread the fear of God and piety among all the tribes. Whilst their
distribution among all the tribes corresponded to this appointment, the
fact that they were not scattered in all the towns and villages of the
other tribes, but were congregated together in separate towns among the
different tribes, preserved them from the disadvantages of standing
alone, and defended them from the danger of moral and spiritual
declension. Lastly, in the number forty-eight, the quadrupling of the
number of the tribes (twelve) is unmistakeable. Now, as the number four
is the seal of the kingdom of God in the world, the idea of the kingdom
of God is also represented in the four times twelve towns (cf. Bhr,
Symbolik, ii. pp. 50, 51).

[Numbers 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 35:9</span></span>

Selection and Appointment of Cities of Refuge for Unpremeditated
Manslayers. - [Num 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#010.md), [Num
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#011.md). When the Israelites had come
into the land of Canaan, they were to choose towns conveniently situated
as cities of refuge, to which the manslayer, who had slain a person
(nephesh) by accident (בּשׁגגה: see at [Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002).md), might flee. הקרה, from קרה, to
hit, occurrit, as well as accidit; signifies here to give or make, i.e.,
to choose something suitable (Dietrich), but not "to build or complete"
(Knobel), in the sense of קרה, as the only meaning which this word has
is contignare, to join with beams or rafters; and this is obviously
unsuitable here. Through these directions, which are repeated and still
further expanded in [Deu 19:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001.md), God
fulfilled the promise which He gave in [Exo
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013.md) : that He would appoint a place
for the man who should unintentionally slay his neighbour, to which he
might flee from the avenger of blood.

[Numbers 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 35:12</span></span>

These towns were to serve for a refuge from the avenger of blood, that
the manslayer might not die before he had taken his trial in the
presence of the congregation. The number of cities was fixed at six,
three on the other side of the Jordan, and three on this side in the
land of Canaan, to which both the children of Israel, and also the
foreigners and settlers who were dwelling among them, might flee. In
[Deu 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#002.md)., Moses advises the
congregation to prepare (הכין) the way to these cities, and to divide
the territory of the land which Jehovah would give them into three parts
(שׁלּשׁ), i.e., to set apart a free city in every third of the land,
that every manslayer might flee thither, i.e., might be able to reach
the free city without being detained by length of distance or badness of
road, lest, as is added in [Deu 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#006.md),
the avenger of blood pursue the slayer while his heart is hot (יחם,
imperf. Kal of חמם), and overtake him because the way is long, and slay
him (נפשׁ הכּה, as in [Gen 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#021).md),
whereas he was not worthy of death (i.e., there was no just ground for
putting him to death), "because he had not done it out of hatred." The
three cities of refuge on the other side were selected by Moses himself
([Deu 4:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041).md); the three in Canaan
were not appointed till the land was distributed among the nine tribes
and a half ([Jos 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007).md). Levitical or
priests' towns were selected for all six, not only because it was to the
priests and Levites that they would first of all look for an
administration of justice (Schultz on [Deu
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#003).md), but also on the ground that
these cities were the property of Jehovah, in a higher sense than the
rest of the land, and for this reason answered the idea of cities of
refuge, where the manslayer, when once received, was placed under the
protection of divine grace, better than any other places possibly could.

The establishment of cities of refuge presupposed the custom and right
of revenge. The custom itself goes back to the very earliest times of
the human race ([Gen 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015.md), [Gen
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#024.md); [Gen
27:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#045).md); it prevailed among the
Israelites, as well as the other nations of antiquity, and still
continues among the Arabs in unlimited force (cf. Niebuhr, Arab. pp.
32ff.; Burckhardt, Beduinen, 119, 251ff.). "Revenge of blood prevailed
almost everywhere, so long as there was no national life generated, or
it was still in the first stages of its development; and consequently
the expiation of any personal violation of justice was left to private
revenge, and more especially to family zeal" (Oehler in Herzog's B.
Cycl., where the proofs may be seen). The warrant for this was the
principle of retribution, the jus talionis, which lay at the foundation
of the divine order of the world in general, and the Mosaic law in
particular, and which was sanctioned by God, so far as murder was
concerned, even in the time of Noah, by the command, "Whoso sheddeth
man's blood," etc. ([Gen 9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005).md). This
warrant, however, or rather obligation to avenge murder, was
subordinated to the essential principle of the theocracy, under the
Mosaic law. Whilst God Himself would avenge the blood that was shed, not
only upon men, but upon animals also ([Gen
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005).md), and commanded blood-revenge, He
withdrew the execution of it from subjective caprice, and restricted it
to cases of premeditated slaying or murder, by appointing cities of
refuge, which were to protect the manslayer from the avenger, until he
took his trial before the congregation. גּאל, redeemer, is "that
particular relative whose special duty it was to restore the violated
family integrity, who had to redeem not only landed property that had
been alienated from the family ([Lev
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025)..md), or a member of the family
that had fallen into slavery ([Lev
25:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#047)..md), but also the blood that had
been taken away from the family by murder" (Oehler). In the latter
respect he was called הדּם גּאל, ([Num
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#019.md), [Num
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#021.md), [Num
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#024.md).; [Deu
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#006.md), [Deu
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#012).md). From [Sa2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#007.md), we may see that it was the duty
of the whole family to take care that blood-revenge was carried out. The
performance of the duty itself, however, was probably regulated by the
closeness of the relationship, and corresponded to the duty of redeeming
from bondage ([Lev 25:49](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#049).md), and to the
right of inheritance ([Num 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#008)..md).
What standing before the congregation was to consist of, is defined more
fully in what follows ([Num 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#024.md),
[Num 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#025).md). If we compare with this
[Jos 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#004.md)., the manslayer, who fled
from the avenger of blood into a free city, was to stand before the
gates of the city, and state his cause before the elders. They were then
to receive him into the city, and give him a place that he might dwell
among them, and were not to deliver him up to the avenger of blood till
he had stood before the congregation for judgment. Consequently, if the
slayer of a man presented himself with the request to be received, the
elders of the free city had to make a provisional inquiry into his case,
to decide whether they should grant him protection in the city; and then
if the avenger of blood appeared, they were not to deliver up the person
whom they had received, but to hand him over, on the charge of the
avenger of blood, to the congregation to whom he belonged, or among whom
the act had taken place, that they might investigate the case, and judge
whether the deed itself was wilful or accidental.

[Numbers 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 35:16</span></span>

Special instructions are given in [Num
35:16-28](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016.md), with reference to the
judicial procedure. First of all ([Num
35:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016).md), with regard to qualified
slaying or murder. If any person has struck another with an iron
instrument (an axe, hatchet, hammer, etc.), or "with a stone of the
hand, from which one dies," i.e., with a stone which filled the hand, -
a large stone, therefore, with which it was possible to kill, - or "with
a wooden instrument of the hand, from which one dies," i.e., with a
thick club, or a large, strong wooden instrument, and he then died (so
that he died in consequence), he was a murderer, who was to be put to
death. "For the suspicion would rest upon any one who had used an
instrument, that endangered life and therefore was not generally used in
striking, that he had intended to take life away" (Knobel).

[Numbers 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 35:19</span></span>

The avenger of blood could put him to death, when he hit upon him, i.e.,
whenever and wherever he met with him.

[Numbers 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 35:20</span></span>

And so also the man who hit another in hatred, or threw at him by lying
in wait, or struck him with the hand in enmity, so that he died. And if
a murderer of this kind fled into a free city, the elders of his city
were to have him fetched out and delivered up to the avenger of blood
([Deu 19:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#011).md). Then follow, in [Num
35:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#022.md), the proceedings to be taken
with an unintentional manslayer, viz., if any one hit another "in the
moment," i.e., suddenly, unawares ([Num
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#009).md), without enmity, or by throwing
anything upon him, without lying in wait, or by letting a stone, by
which a man might be killed, fall upon him without seeing him, so that
he died in consequence, but without being his enemy, or watching to do
him harm. In using the expression בּכל־אבן, the writer had probably
השׁליך still in his mind; but he dropped this word, and wrote ויּפּל in
the form of a fresh sentence. The thing intended is explained still more
clearly in [Deu 19:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#004.md). Instead of
בּפתע, we find there בּבלי־דעת, without knowing unintentionally. The
words, "without being his enemy," are paraphrased there by, "without
hating him from yesterday and the day before yesterday" (i.e.,
previously), and are explained by an example taken from the life: "When
a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand
fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the iron
slippeth (נשׁל Niphal of שׁלל) from the wood (handle), and lighteth upon
his neighbour."

[Numbers 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 35:24</span></span>

In such a case as this, the congregation was to judge between the slayer
and the avenger of blood, according to the judgments before them. They
were to rescue the innocent man from the avenger of blood, to bring him
back to his (i.e., the nearest) city of refuge to which he had fled,
that he might dwell there till the death of the high priest, who had
been anointed with the holy oil.

[Numbers 35:26](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 35:26</span></span>

If he left the city of refuge before this, and the avenger of blood got
hold of him, and slew him outside the borders (precincts) of the city,
it was not to be reckoned to him as blood (דּם לו אין, like דּמים לו
אין, [Exo 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001).md). But after the death
of the high priest he might return "into the land of his possession,"
i.e., his hereditary possession (cf. [Lev
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#022).md), sc., without the avenger of
blood being allowed to pursue him any longer.

In these regulations "all the rigour of the divine justice is manifested
in the most beautiful concord with His compassionate mercy. Through the
destruction of life, even when not wilful, human blood had been shed,
and demanded expiation. Yet this expiation did not consist in the death
of the offender himself, because he had not sinned wilfully." Hence an
asylum was provided for him in the free city, to which he might escape,
and where he would lie concealed. This sojourn in the free city was not
to be regarded as banishment, although separation from house, home, and
family was certainly a punishment; but it was a concealment under "the
protection of the mercy of God, which opened places of escape in the
cities of refuge from the carnal ardour of the avenger of blood, where
the slayer remained concealed until his sin was expiated by the death of
the high priest." For the fact, that the death of the high priest was
hereby regarded as expiatory, as many of the Rabbins, fathers, and
earlier commentators maintain (see my Comm. on Joshua, p. 448), is
unmistakeably evident from the addition of the clause, "who has been
anointed with the holy oil," which would appear unmeaning and
superfluous on any other view. This clause points to the inward
connection between the return of the slayer and the death of the high
priest. "The anointing with the holy oil was a symbol of the
communication of the Holy Ghost, by which the high priest was empowered
to act as mediator and representative of the nation before God, so that
he alone could carry out the yearly and general expiation for the whole
nation, on the great day of atonement. But as his life and work acquired
a representative signification through this anointing with the Holy
Ghost, his death might also be regarded as a death for the sins of the
people, by virtue of the Holy Ghost imparted to him, through which the
unintentional manslayer received the benefits of the propitiation for
his sin before God, so that he could return cleansed to his native town,
without further exposure to the vengeance of the avenger of blood"
(Comm. on Joshua, p. 448). But inasmuch as, according to this view, the
death of the high priest had the same result in a certain sense, in
relation to his time of office, as his function on the day of atonement
had had every year, "the death of the earthly high priest became thereby
a type of that of the heavenly One, who, through the eternal (holy)
Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God, that we might be redeemed
from our transgressions, and receive the promised eternal inheritance
([Heb 9:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014).md). Just as the blood of
Christ wrought out eternal redemption, only because through the eternal
Spirit He offered Himself without spot to God, so the death of the high
priest of the Old Testament secured the complete deliverance of the
manslayer form his sin, only because he had been anointed with the holy
oil, the symbol of the Holy Ghost."

[Numbers 35:29](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 35:29</span></span>

If, therefore, the confinement of the unintentional manslayer in the
city of refuge was neither an ordinary exile nor merely a means of
rescuing him from the revenge of the enraged goel, but an appointment of
the just and merciful God for the expiation of human blood even though
not wilfully shed, that, whilst there was no violation of judicial
righteousness, a barrier might be set to the unrighteousness of family
revenge; it was necessary to guard against any such abuse of this
gracious provision of the righteous God, as that into which the heathen
right of asylum had degenerated.

(Note: On the asyla, in general, see Winer's Real-Wrterbuch, art.
Freistatt; Pauly, Real-encyckl. der class. Alterthums-wissenschaft, Bd.
i. s. v. Asylum; but more especially K. Dann, "ber den Ursprung des
Asylrechts und dessen Schicksale und Ueberreste in Europa," in his
Ztschr. fr deutsches Recht, Lpz. 1840. "The asyla of the Greeks, Romans,
and Germans differed altogether from those of the Hebrews; for whilst
the latter were never intended to save the wilful criminal from the
punishment he deserved, but were simply established for the purpose of
securing a just sentence, the former actually answered the purpose of
rescuing the criminal from the punishment which he legally deserved.")

The instructions which follow in [Num
35:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#029.md) were intended to secure this
object. In [Num 35:29](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#029.md), there is first
of all the general law, that these instructions (those given in vv.
11-28) were to be for a statute of judgment (see [Num
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#011).md) for all future ages
("throughout your generations," see [Exo
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014.md), [Exo
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#020).md). Then, in [Num
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#030.md), a just judgment is enforced in
the treatment of murder. "Whoso killeth any person (these words are
construed absolutely), at the mouth (the testimony) of witnesses shall
the murderer be put to death; and one witness shall not answer (give
evidence) against a person to die;" i.e., if the taking of life were in
question, capital punishment was not to be inflicted upon the testimony
of one person only, but upon that of a plurality of witnesses. One
witness could not only be more easily mistaken than several, but would
be more likely to be partial than several persons who were unanimous in
bearing witness to one and the same thing. The number of witnesses was
afterwards fixed at two witnesses, at least, in the case of capital
crimes ([Deu 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006).md), and two or three
in the case of every crime ([Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md); cf. [Joh
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#017.md); [Co2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md); [Heb
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028).md). - Lastly ([Num
35:31](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#031)..md), the command is given not to
take redemption money, either for the life of the murderer, who was a
wicked man to die, i.e., deserving of death (such a man was to be put to
death); nor "for fleeing into the city of refuge, to return to dwell in
the land till the death of the high priest:" that is to say, they were
neither to allow the wilful murderer to come to terms with the relative
of the man who had been put to death, by the payment of a redemption
fee, and so to save his life, as is not unfrequently the case in the
East at the present day (cf. Robinson, Pal. i. p. 209, and Lane's
Manners and Customs); nor even to allow the unintentional murderer to
purchase permission to return home from the city of refuge before the
death of the high priest, by the payment of a money compensation.

[Numbers 35:33](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 35:33</span></span>

The Israelites were not to desecrate their land by sparing the murderer;
as blood, i.e., bloodshed or murder, desecrated the land, and there was
no expiation (יכפּר) to the land for the blood that was shed in it,
except through the blood of the man who had shed it, i.e., through the
execution of the murderer, by which justice would be satisfied.

And they were not to desecrate the land in which they dwelt by
tolerating murderers, because Jehovah, the Holy One, dwelt in it, among
the children of Israel (cf. [Lev
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025)..md).
