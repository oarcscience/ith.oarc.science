### [Ezekiel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 2:1</span></span>

Call of Ezekiel to the Prophetic Office - [Eze
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md) and [Eze
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#002.md). Upon the manifestation of the
Lord follows the word of vocation. Having, in the feeling of his
weakness and sinfulness, fallen to the ground before the terrible
revelation of Jehovah's glory, Ezekiel is first of all raised up again
by the voice of God, to hear the word which calls him to the prophetic
function. - [Eze 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md). And He said to
me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, I will speak with thee. [Eze
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#002.md). Then came spirit unto me as He
spake unto me, and it placed me on my feet, and I heard Him speaking
unto me. - The address בּן־אדם occurs so frequently in Ezekiel, that it
must be regarded as one of the peculiarities of his prophecies.
Elsewhere it occurs only once, [Dan
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md). That it is significant, is
generally recognised, although its meaning is variously given. Most
expositors take it as a reminder of the weakness and frailness of human
nature; Coccejus and Kliefoth, on the contrary, connect it with the
circumstance that God appears to Ezekiel in human form, and find in it a
τεκμήριον amicitiae, that God speaks in him as man to man, converses
with him as a man with his friend. This last interpretation, however,
has against it the usus loquendi. As בּן־אדם denotes man according to
his natural condition, it is used throughout as a synonym with אנושׁ,
denoting the weakness and fragility of man in opposition to God; cf.
[Psa 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md); [Job
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#006.md); [Isa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md); [Isa
56:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#002.md); and [Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md). This is the meaning also of
בּן־אדם in the address, as may be distinctly seen from the various
addresses in Daniel. Daniel is addressed, where comfort is to be
imparted to him, as אישׁׁ חמדות, "man greatly beloved," [Dan
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#011.md), [Dan
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#019.md), cf. [Dan
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023.md); but, on the contrary, in [Eze
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017.md), where he has fallen on his face
in terror before the appearance of Gabriel, with the words, "Understand,
O son of man," in order to remind him of his human weakness. This is
also the case in our verse, where Ezekiel, too, had fallen upon his
face, and by God's word spoken to him, is again raised to his feet. It
is only in Ezekiel that this address is constantly employed to mark the
distance between the human weakness of his nature and the divine power
which gives him the capacity and the impulse to speak. Not, however,
with the design, mentioned by Jerome on [Dan
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md), "that he may not be elated on
account of his high calling," because, as Hvernick subjoins, Ezekiel's
extremely powerful and forcible nature may have needed to be perpetually
reminded of what it is in reality before God. If this were the meaning
and object of this address, it would also probably occur in the writings
of several of the other prophets, as the supposition that the nature of
Ezekiel was more powerful and forcible than that of the other prophets
is altogether without foundation. The constant use of this form of
address in Ezekiel is connected rather with the manner and fashion in
which most of the revelations were imparted to him, that is, with the
prevalence of "vision," in which the distinction between God and man
comes out more prominently than in ordinary inspiration or revelation,
effected by means of an impression upon the inner faculties of man. The
bringing prominently forward, however, of the distance between God and
men is to remind the prophet, as well as the people to whom he
communicated his revelations, not merely of the weakness of humanity,
but to show them, at the same time, how powerfully the word of God
operates in feeble man, and also that God, who has selected the prophet
as the organ of His will, possesses also the power to redeem the people,
that were lying powerless under the oppression of the heathen, from
their misery, and to raise them up again. - At the word of the Lord,
"Stand upon thy feet," came רוּח into the prophet, which raised him to
his feet. רוּח here is not "life consciousness" (Hitzig), but the
spirit-power which proceeds from God, and which is conveyed through the
word which imparted to him the strength to stand before the face of God,
and to undertake His command. מדּבּר, partic. Hithpa., properly
"collocutor," occurs here and in [Eze
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#006.md), and in [Num
7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089.md); elsewhere, only in [Sa2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#013.md).

[Ezekiel 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 2:3</span></span>

The calling of the prophet begins with the Lord describing to Ezekiel
the people to whom He is sending him, in order to make him acquainted
with the difficulties of his vocation, and to encourage him for the
discharge of the same. [Eze 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003.md). And
He said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to the
rebels who have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have fallen
away from me, even until this very day. [Eze
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#004.md). And the children are of hard
face, and hardened heart. To them I send thee; and to them shalt thou
speak: Thus says the Lord Jehovah. [Eze
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005.md). And they - they may hear thee or
fail (to do so); for they are a stiff-necked race - they shall
experience that a prophet has been in their midst. [Eze
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006.md). But thou, son of man, fear not
before them, and be not afraid of their words, if thistles and thorns
are found about thee, and thou sittest upon scorpions; fear not before
their words, and tremble not before their face; for they are a
stiff-necked race. [Eze 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#007.md). And speak
my words to them, whether they may hear or fail (to do so); for they are
stiff-necked.

The children of Israel have become heathen, no longer a people of God,
not even a heathen nation (גּוי, [Isa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004).md), but גּוים, "heathens," that is,
as being rebels against God. המּורדים (with the article) is not to be
joined as an adjective to גּוים, which is without the article, but is
employed substantively in the form of an apposition. They have rebelled
against God in this, that they, like their fathers, have separated
themselves from Jehovah down to this day (as regards פּשׁע בּ, see on
[Isa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md); and עצם היּום הזּה, as in
the Pentateuch; cf. [Lev 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014.md); [Gen
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#013.md); [Gen
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#023), etc..md). Like their fathers, the
sons are rebellious, and, in addition, they are קשׁי פנים, of hard
countenance" = חזקי, "of hard brow" ([Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007).md), i.e., impudent, without hiding
the face, or lowering the look for shame. This shamelessness springs
from hardness of heart. To these hardened sinners Ezekiel is to announce
the word of the Lord. Whether they hear it or not (אם־ואם, sive-sive, as
in [Jos 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015.md); [Ecc
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md); [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014).md), they shall in any case
experience that a prophet has been amongst them. That they will neglect
to hear is very probable, because they are a stiff-necked race (בּית,
"house" = family). The Vau before ידעוּ ([Eze
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005).md) introduces the apodosis. היה is
perfect, not present. This is demanded by the usus loquendi and the
connection of the thought. The meaning is not: they shall now from his
testimony that a prophet is there; but they shall experience from the
result, viz., when the word announced by him will have been fulfilled,
that a prophet has been amongst them. Ezekiel, therefore, is not to be
prevented by fear of them and their words from delivering a testimony
against their sins. The ἁπάξ λεγόμενα, סרבים and סלּונים, are not, with
the older expositors, to be explained adjectively: "rebelles et
renuentes," but are substantives. As regards סלּון, the signification
"thorn" is placed beyond doubt by סלּון in [Eze
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024.md), and סרב in Aramaic does indeed
denote "refractarius;" but this signification is a derived one, and
inappropriate here. סרב is related to צרב, "to burn, to singe," and
means "urtica," "stinging-nettle, thistle," as Donasch in Raschi has
already explained it. אותך is, according to the later usage, for אתּך,
expressing the "by and with of association," and occurs frequently in
Ezekiel. Thistles and thorns are emblems of dangerous, hostile men. The
thought is strengthened by the words "to sit on (אל for על) scorpions,"
as these animals inflict a painful and dangerous wound. For the
similitude of dangerous men to scorpions, cf. Sir. 26:10, and other
proof passages in Bochart, Hierozoic. III. p. 551f., ed. Rosenmll.

[Ezekiel 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 2:8</span></span>

After the Lord had pointed out to the prophet the difficulties of the
call laid upon him, He prepared him for the performance of his office,
by inspiring him with the divine word which he is to announce. - [Eze
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008.md). And thou, son of man, hear what I
say to thee, Be not stiff-necked like the stiff-necked race; open thy
mouth, and eat what I give unto thee. [Eze
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009.md). Then I saw, and, lo, a hand
outstretched towards me; and, lo, in the same a roll of a book. [Eze
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010.md). And He spread it out before me;
the same was written upon the front and back: and there were written
upon it lamentations, and sighing, and woe. [Eze
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md). And He said to me: Son of man,
what thou findest eat; eat the roll, and go and speak to the house of
Israel. [Eze 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#002.md). Then opened I my
mouth, and He gave me this roll to eat. [Eze
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#003.md). And said to me: Son of man, feed
thy belly, and fill thy body with this roll which I give thee. And I ate
it, and it was in my mouth as honey and sweetness. - The prophet is to
announce to the people of Israel only that which the Lord inspires him
to announce. This thought is embodied in symbol, in such a way that an
outstretched hand reaches to him a book, which he is to swallow, and
which also, at God's command, he does swallow; cf. [Rev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009.md). This roll was inscribed on both
sides with lamentations, sighing, and woe (הי is either abbreviated from
נהי, not = אי, or as Ewald, 101c, thinks, is only a more distinct form
of הוי or הו). The meaning is not, that upon the roll was inscribed a
multitude of mournful expressions of every kind, but that there was
written upon it all that the prophet was to announce, and what we now
read in his book. These contents were of a mournful nature, for they
related to the destruction of the kingdom, the destruction of Jerusalem
and of the temple. That Ezekiel may look over the contents, the roll is
spread out before his eyes, and then handed to him to be eaten, with the
words, "Go and speak to the children of Israel," i.e., announce to the
children of Israel what you have received into yourself, or as it is
termed in [Eze 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#004.md), דּברי, "my words."
The words in [Eze 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#003.md) were spoken by
God while handing to the prophet the roll to be eaten. He is not merely
to eat, i.e., take it into his mouth, but he is to fill his body and
belly therewith, i.e., he is to receive into his innermost being the
word of God presented to him, to change it, as it were, into sap and
blood. Whilst eating it, it was sweet in his mouth. The sweet taste must
not, with Kliefoth, be explained away into a sweet "after-taste," and
made to bear this reference, that the destruction of Jerusalem would be
followed by a more glorious restoration. The roll, inscribed with
lamentation, sorrow, and woe, tasted to him sweetly, because its
contents was God's word, which sufficed for the joy and gladness of his
heart ([Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016).md); for it is
"infinitely sweet and lovely to be the organ and spokesman of the
Omnipotent," and even the most painful of divine truths possess to a
spiritually-minded man a joyful and quickening side (Hengstenberg on
[Rev 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009).md). To this it is added, that
the divine penal judgments reveal not only the holiness and
righteousness of God, but also prepare the way for the revelation of
salvation, and minister to the saving of the soul.
