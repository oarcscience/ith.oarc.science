[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 21:1</span></span>

After these events Ahab was seized with such a desire for a vineyard
which was situated near his palace at Jezreel, that when Naboth, the
owner of the vineyard, refused to part with his paternal inheritance, he
became thoroughly dejected, until his wife Jezebel paved the way for the
forcible seizure of the desired possession by the shameful execution of
Naboth ([Kg1 21:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001)). But when Ahab
was preparing to take possession of the vineyard, Elijah came to meet
him with the announcement, that both he and his wife would be visited by
the Lord with a bloody death for this murder and robbery, and that his
idolatry would be punished with the extermination of all his house ([Kg1
21:16-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#016)). Ahab was so affected by
this, that he humbled himself before God; whereupon the Lord told
Elijah, that the threatened judgment should not burst upon his house
till after Ahab's death ([Kg1
21:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027)).

[Kg1 21:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001)

Ahab wanted to obtain possession of the vineyard of Naboth, which was in
Jezreel (אשׁר refers to כּרם), near the palace of the king, either in
exchange for another vineyard or for money, that he might make a
vegetable garden of it. From the fact that Ahab is called the king of
Samaria we may infer that Jezreel, the present Zerin (see at [Jos
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018)), was only a summer residence of
the king.

[Kg1 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#003)

Naboth refused to part with the vineyard, because it was the inheritance
of his fathers, that is to say, on religious grounds (חלילה כּי מיהוה),
because the sale of a paternal inheritance was forbidden in the law
([Lev 25:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023); [Num
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#007).). He was therefore not merely at
liberty as a personal right to refuse the king's proposal, but bound by
the commandment of God.

[Kg1 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#004)

Instead of respecting this tender feeling of shrinking from the
transgression of the law and desisting from his coveting, Ahab went
home, i.e., to Samaria (cf. [Kg1
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008)), sullen and morose (סר וזעף as
in [Kg1 20:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#043)), lay down upon his bed,
turned his face (viz., to the wall; cf. [Kg2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#002)) - "after the manner of sorrowful
persons, who shrink from and refuse all conversation, and even the sight
of others" (Seb. Schmidt) - and did not eat. This childish mode of
giving expression to his displeasure at Naboth's refusal to comply with
his wish, shows very clearly that Ahab was a man sold under sin ([Kg1
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020)), who only wanted the requisite
energy to display the wickedness of his heart in vigorous action.

[Kg1 21:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#005)

When Jezebel learned the cause of Ahab's ill-humour, she said to him,
"Thou, dost thou now exercise royal authority over Israel." אתּה is
placed first for the sake of emphasis, and the sentence is to be taken
as an ironical question, as it has been by the lxx. "I (if thou hast not
courage enough to act) will procure thee the vineyard of Naboth the
Jezreelite."

[Kg1 21:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008)

The shameless woman then wrote a letter in the name of Ahab, sealed it
below with the royal seal, which probably bore the king's signature and
was stamped upon the writing instead of signing the name, as is done at
the present day among Arabs, Turks, and Persians (vid., Paulsen, Reg.
der Morgenl. p. 295ff.), to give it the character of a royal command
(cf. [Est 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#013); [Dan
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#017)), and sent this letter (the
Chethb הסּפרים is correct, and the Keri has arisen from a
misunderstanding) to the elders and nobles of his town (i.e., the
members of the magistracy, [Deu
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018)), who lived near Naboth, and
therefore had an opportunity to watch his mode of life, and appeared to
be the most suitable persons to institute the charge that was to be
brought against him. The letter ran thus: "Proclaim a fast, and set
Naboth at the head of the people, and set two worthless men opposite to
him, that they may give evidence against him: Thou hast blasphemed God
and king; and lead him out and stone him, that he may die." Jezebel
ordered the fasting for a sign, as though some public crime or heavy
load of guilt rested upon the city, for which it was necessary that it
should humble itself before God ([Sa1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#006)). The intention was, that at the
very outset the appearance of justice should be given to the legal
process about to be instituted in the eyes of all the citizens, and the
stamp of veracity impressed upon the crime of which Naboth was to be
accused. העם בראשׁ...הושׁיבוּ, "seat him at the head of the people,"
i.e., bring him to the court of justice as a defendant before all the
people. The expression may be explained from the fact, that a sitting of
the elders was appointed for judicial business, in which Naboth and the
witnesses who were to accuse him of blasphemy took part seated. To
preserve the appearance of justice, two witnesses were appointed,
according to the law in [Deu 17:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006);
[Deu 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015); [Num
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#030); but worthless men, as at the
trial of Jesus ([Mat 26:60](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#060)). אלהים
בּרך, to bless God, i.e., to bid Him farewell, to dismiss Him, as in
[Job 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009), equivalent to blaspheming
God. God and king are mentioned together, like God and prince in [Exo
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#027), to make it possible to accuse
Naboth of transgressing this law, and to put him to death as a
blasphemer of God, according to [Deu
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#011) and [Deu
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#005), where the punishment of stoning
is awarded to idolatry as a practical denial of God. Blaspheming the
king is not to be taken as a second crime to be added to the blasphemy
of God; but blaspheming the king, as the visible representative of God,
was eo ipso also blaspheming God.

[Kg1 21:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#011)

The elders of Jezreel executed this command without delay; a striking
proof both of deep moral corruption and of slavish fear of the tyranny
of the ruthless queen.

[Kg1 21:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#014)

When the report of Naboth's execution was brought to her, she called
upon Ahab to take possession of his vineyard (רשׁ = רשׁ, [Deu
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024)). As Naboth's sons were put to
death at the same time, according to [Kg2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026), the king was able to confiscate
his property; not, indeed, on any rule laid down in the Mosaic law, but
according to a principle involved in the very idea of high treason.
Since, for example, in the case of blasphemy the property of the
criminal was forfeited to the Lord as cherem ([Deu
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#016)), the property of traitors was
regarded as forfeited to the king.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 21:16</span></span>

But when Ahab went down to Jezreel to take possession of the vineyard of
Naboth, Elijah came to meet him by the command of God, with the word of
the Lord, "Hast thou murdered and also taken possession?" The question
served to sharpen his conscience, since Ahab was obliged to admit the
fact. בּשׁמרון אשׁר means "who lives at Samaria," for when Elijah came
to meet him, Ahab was in Jezreel, Elijah then said to him still further:
"Thus saith the Lord: In the place where the dogs have licked the blood
of Naboth, will they also lick thine, yea, thy blood." אתּה גּם serves
as an emphatic repetition of the suffix (cf. Ges. 121, 3). This threat
was only so far fulfilled upon Ahab, from the compassion of God, and in
consequence of his humbling himself under the divine judgment ([Kg1
21:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027)), that dogs licked his blood
at Samaria when the carriage was washed in which he had died ([Kg1
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#038)); but it was literally fulfilled
in the case of his son Joram, whose corpse was cast into Naboth's piece
of ground ([Kg2 9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 21:20</span></span>

Ahab answered, "Hast thou found me (met with me), O mine enemy?" (not,
hast thou ever found me thine enemy? - Vulg., Luth.) i.e., dost thou
come to meet me again, mine enemy? He calls Elijah his enemy, to take
the sting from the prophet's threat as an utterance caused by personal
enmity. But Elijah fearlessly replied, "I have found (thee), because
thou sellest thyself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord." He then
announced to him, in [Kg1 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021), [Kg1
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#022), the extermination of his house,
and to Jezebel, as the principal sinner, the most ignominious end ([Kg1
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#023)). הרע לעשׂות חתמכּר to sell
one's self to do evil, i.e., to give one's self to evil so as to have no
will of one's own, to make one's self the slave of evil (cf. [Kg1
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025), [Kg2
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#017)). The consequence of this is
πεπρᾶσθαι ὑπὸ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ([Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014)), sin exercising unlimited power
over the man who gives himself up to it as a slave. For [Kg1
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021), [Kg1
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#022), see [Kg1
14:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010); [Kg1
15:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029); [Kg1
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#003), [Kg1
16:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#012). The threat concerning
Jezebel ([Kg1 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#023)) was literally
fulfilled, according to [Kg2 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030). חל,
written defectively for חיל, as in [Sa2
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015), is properly the open space by
the town-wall, pomoerium. Instead of בּחל we have בּחלק in the
repetition of this threat in [Kg2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#010), [Kg2
9:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#036), and consequently Thenius and
others propose to alter the חל here. But there is no necessity for this,
as בּחלק, on the portion, i.e., the town-land, of Jezreel (not, in the
field at Jezreel), is only a more general epithet denoting the locality,
and חל is proved to be the original word by the lxx.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 21:25</span></span>

[Kg1 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025), [Kg1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#026) contain a reflection on the part
of the historian concerning Ahab's ungodly conduct, whereby he brought
such an ignominious end upon himself and his house. וגו היה לא רק, "only
there has not been (one) like Ahab," i.e., there was no one else like
Ahab, "who sold himself," etc. הסתּה for הסיתה, from סוּת, to entice, to
seduce or lead astray (cf. Ewald, 114, a., and Ges. 72, Anm. 6). ויּתעב,
and he acted abominably. Amorites: for Canaanites, as in [Gen
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016), etc.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 21:27</span></span>

This terrible threat made such an impression upon Ahab, that he felt
deep remorse, and for a time at least was sincerely penitent. Rending
the clothes, putting on the mourning garment of hair (שׂק), and fasting,
are frequently mentioned as external signs of humiliation before God or
of deep mourning on account of sin. יהלּך אט, he walked about lightly
(slowly), like one in deep trouble. This repentance was neither
hypocritical, nor purely external; but it was sincere even if it was not
lasting and produced no real conversion. For the Lord Himself
acknowledge it to be humiliation before Him ([Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029)), and said to Elijah, that
because of it He would not bring the threatened calamity upon Ahab's
house in his own lifetime, but only in the days of his son. אבי for
אביא, as in [Kg1 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021).
