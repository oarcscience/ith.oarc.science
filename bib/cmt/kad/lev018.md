### [Leviticus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001)

[Leviticus 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 18:1</span></span>

Holiness of the Marriage Relation. - The prohibition of incest and
similar sensual abominations is introduced with a general warning as to
the licentious customs of the Egyptians and Canaanites, and an
exhortation to walk in the judgments and ordinances of Jehovah ([Lev
18:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#002)), and is brought to a close
with a threatening allusion to the consequences of all such defilements
([Lev 18:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024)).

[Lev 18:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001)

By the words, "I am Jehovah your God," which are placed at the head and
repeated at the close ([Lev 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#030)),
the observance of the command is enforced upon the people as a covenant
obligation, and urged upon them most strongly by the promise, that
through the observance of the ordinances and judgments of Jehovah they
should live ([Lev 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005)).

[Lev 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005)

"The man who does them (the ordinances of Jehovah) shall live (gain true
life) through them" (see at [Exo 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#016)
and [Gen 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022)).

[Leviticus 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 18:6</span></span>

The laws against incest are introduced in [Lev
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006) with the general prohibition,
descriptive of the nature of this sin, "None of you shall approach
בּשׂרו אל־כּל־שׁאר to any flesh of his flesh, to uncover nakedness." The
difference between שׁאר flesh, and בּשׂר flesh, is involved in
obscurity, as both words are used in connection with edible flesh (see
the Lexicons). "Flesh of his flesh" is a flesh that is of his own flesh,
belongs to the same flesh as himself ([Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024)), and is applied to a
blood-relation, blood-relationship being called שׁארה (or flesh-kindred)
in Hebrew ([Lev 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017)). Sexual
intercourse is called uncovering the nakedness of another ([Eze
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#036); [Eze
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#018)). The prohibition relates to
both married and unmarried intercourse, though the reference is chiefly
to the former (see [Lev 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018); [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014), [Lev
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017), [Lev
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#021)). Intercourse is forbidden (1)
with a mother, (2) with a step-mother, (3) with a sister or half-sister,
(4) with a granddaughter, the daughter of either son or daughter, (5)
with the daughter of a step-mother, (6) with an aunt, the sister of
either father or mother, (7) with the wife of an uncle on the father's
side, (8) with a daughter-in-law, (9) with a sister-in-law, or brother's
wife, (10) with a woman and her daughter, or a woman and her
granddaughter, and (11) with two sisters at the same time. No special
reference is made to sexual intercourse with (a) a daughter, (b) a full
sister, (c) a mother-in-law; the last, however, which is mentioned in
[Deu 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#023) as an accursed crime, is
included here in No. 10, and the second in No. 3, whilst the first, like
parricide in [Exo 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#015), is not
expressly noticed, simply because the crime was regarded as one that
never could occur. Those mentioned under Nos. 1, 2, 3, 8, and 10 were to
be followed by the death or extermination of the criminals ([Lev
20:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#011), [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014), [Lev
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017)), on account of their being
accursed crimes ([Deu 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001); [Deu
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#020), [Deu
27:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#022)). On the other hand, the only
threat held out in the case of the connection mentioned under Nos. 6, 7,
and 9, was that those who committed such crimes should bear their
iniquity, or die childless ([Lev
20:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#019)). The cases noticed under
Nos. 4 and 5 are passed over in ch. 20, though they no doubt belonged to
the crimes which were to be punished with death, and No. 11, for which
no punishment was fixed, because the wrong had been already pointed out
in [Lev 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018).

(Note: The marriage laws and customs were much more lax among the
Gentiles. With the Egyptians it was lawful to marry sisters and
half-sisters (Diod. Sic. i. 27), and the licentiousness of the women was
very great among them (see at [Gen
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#006).). With the Persians marriage was
allowed with mother, daughter, and sister (Clem. Al. strom. iii. p. 431;
Eusebii praep. ev. vi. 10); and this is also said to have been the case
with the Medians, Indians, and Ethiopians, as well as with the Assyrians
(Jerome adv. Jovin. ii. 7; Lucian, Sacriff. 5); whereas the Greeks and
Romans abhorred such marriages, and the Athenians and Spartans only
permitted marriages with half-sisters (cf. Selden de jure nat. et gent.
v. 11, pp. 619ff.). The ancient Arabs, before the time of Mohammed, were
very strict in this respect, and would not allow of marriage with a
mother, daughter, or aunt on either the father's or mother's side, or
with two sisters at the same time. The only cases on record of marriage
between brothers and sisters are among the Arabs of Marbat (Seetzen,
Zach's Mon. Corresp. Oct. 1809). This custom Mohammed raised into a law,
and extended it to nieces, nurses, foster-sisters, etc. (Koran, Sure iv.
20ff.).)

Elaborate commentaries upon this chapter are to be found in Michaelis
Abhandl. ber die Ehegesetze Mosis, and his Mos. Recht; also in Saalschtz
Mos. Recth. See also my Archologie ii. p. 108. For the rabbinical laws
and those of the Talmud, see Selden oxur ebr. lib. 1, c. 1ff., and
Saalschtz ut sup.

The enumeration of the different cases commences in [Lev
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007) very appropriately with the
prohibition of incest with a mother. Sexual connection with a mother is
called "uncovering the nakedness of father and mother." As husband and
wife are one flesh ([Gen 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024)), the
nakedness of the husband is uncovered in that of his wife, or, as it is
described in [Deu 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#030); [Deu
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#020), the wing, i.e., the edge, of
the bedclothes of the father's bed, as the husband spreads his
bedclothes over his wife as well as himself ([Rut
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009)). For, strictly speaking, ערוה
גּלּה is only used with reference to the wife; but in the dishonouring
of his wife the honour of the husband is violated also, and his bed
defiled, [Gen 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004). It is wrong,
therefore, to interpret the verse, as Jonathan and Clericus do, as
relating to carnal intercourse between a daughter and father. Not only
is this at variance with the circumstance that all these laws are
intended for the man alone, and addressed expressly to him, but also
with [Lev 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008), where the nakedness of
the father's wife is distinctly called the father's shame.

[Leviticus 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 18:8</span></span>

Intercourse with a father's wife, i.e., with a step-mother, is forbidden
as uncovering the father's nakedness; since a father's wife stood in
blood-relationship only to the son whose mother she was. But for the
father's sake her nakedness was to be inaccessible to the son, and
uncovering it was to be punished with death as incest ([Lev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#011); [Deu
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#020)). By the "father's wife" we are
probably to understand not merely his full lawful wife, but his
concubine also, since the father's bed was defiled in the latter case no
less than in the former ([Gen 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004)),
and an accursed crime was committed, the punishment of which was death.
At all events, it cannot be inferred from [Lev
19:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#020) and [Exo
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#009), as Knobel supposes, that a
milder punishment was inflicted in this case.

[Leviticus 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 18:9</span></span>

By the sister, the daughter of father or mother, we are to understand
only the step-or half-sister, who had either the same father or the same
mother as the brother had. The clause, "whether born at home or born
abroad," does not refer to legitimate or illegitimate birth, but is to
be taken as a more precise definition of the words, daughter of thy
father or of thy mother, and understood, as Lud. de Dieu supposes, as
referring to the half-sister "of the first marriage, whether the
father's daughter left by a deceased wife, or the mother's daughter left
by a deceased husband," so that the person marrying her would be a son
by a second marriage. Sexual intercourse with a half-sister is described
as חסד in [Lev 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017), and threatened
with extermination. This word generally signifies sparing love, favour,
grace; but here, as in [Pro 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#034), it
means dishonour, shame, from the Piel חסּד, to dishonour.

[Leviticus 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 18:10</span></span>

The prohibition of marriage with a granddaughter, whether the daughter
of a son or daughter, is explained in the words, "for they are thy
nakedness," the meaning of which is, that as they were directly
descended from the grandfather, carnal intercourse with them would be
equivalent to dishonouring his own flesh and blood.

[Leviticus 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 18:11</span></span>

"The daughter of thy father's wife (i.e., thy step-mother), born to thy
father," is the half-sister by a second marriage; and the prohibition
refers to the son by a first marriage, whereas [Lev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009) treats of the son by a second
marriage. The notion that the man's own mother is also included, and
that the prohibition includes marriage with a full sister, is at
variance with the usage of the expression "thy father's wife."

[Leviticus 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 18:12</span></span>

Marriage or conjugal intercourse with the sister of either father or
mother (i.e., with either the paternal or maternal aunt) was prohibited,
because she was the blood-relation of the father or mother. שׁאר = בּשׂר
שׁאר ([Lev 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006), as in [Lev
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#019); [Lev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#002); [Num
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#011)), hence שׁארה,
blood-relationship ([Lev 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017)).

[Leviticus 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 18:14</span></span>

So, again, with the wife of the father's brother, because the nakedness
of the uncle was thereby uncovered. The threat held out in [Lev
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#019) and [Lev
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#020) against the alliances prohibited
in [Lev 18:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#012), is that the persons
concerned should bear their iniquity or sin, i.e., should suffer
punishment in consequence (see at [Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001)); and in the last case it is
stated that they should die childless. From this it is obvious that
sexual connection with the sister of either father or mother was not to
be punished with death by the magistrate, but would be punished with
disease by God Himself.

[Leviticus 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 18:15</span></span>

Sexual connection with a daughter-in-law, a son's wife, is called תּבל
in [Lev 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#012), and threatened with
death to both the parties concerned. תּבל, from בּלל to mix, to confuse,
signifies a sinful mixing up or confusing of the divine ordinances by
unnatural unchastity, like the lying of a woman with a beast, which is
the only other connection in which the word occurs ([Lev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#023)).

[Leviticus 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 18:16</span></span>

Marriage with a brother's wife was a sin against the brother's
nakedness, a sexual defilement, which God would punish with barrenness.
This prohibition, however, only refers to cases in which the deceased
brother had left children; for if he had died childless, the brother not
only might, but was required to marry his sister-in-law ([Deu
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005)).

[Leviticus 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 18:17</span></span>

Marriage with a woman and her daughter, whether both together or in
succession, is described in [Deu 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#020)
as an accursed lying with the mother-in-law; whereas here it is the
relation to the step-daughter which is primarily referred to, as we may
see from the parallel prohibition, which is added, against taking the
daughter of her son or daughter, i.e., the granddaughter-in-law. Both of
these were crimes against blood-relationship which were to be punished
with death in the case of both parties ([Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014)), because they were
"wickedness," זמּה, lit., invention, design, here applied to the crime
of licentiousness and whoredom ([Lev
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#029); [Jdg
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#006); [Job
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#011)).

[Leviticus 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 18:18</span></span>

Lastly, it was forbidden to take a wife to her sister (עליה upon her, as
in [Gen 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#009); [Gen
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050)) in her life-time, that is to
say, to marry two sisters at the same time, לצרר "to pack together, to
uncover this nakedness," i.e., to pack both together into one marriage
bond, and so place the sisters in carnal union through their common
husband, and disturb the sisterly relation, as the marriage with two
sisters that was forced upon Jacob had evidently done. No punishment is
fixed for the marriage with two sisters; and, of course, after the death
of the first wife a man was at liberty to marry her sister.

[Leviticus 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 18:19</span></span>

Prohibition of other kinds of unchastity and of unnatural crimes. - [Lev
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019) prohibits intercourse with a
woman during her uncleanness. טמאה נדּת signifies the uncleanness of a
woman's hemorrhage, whether menstruation or after childbirth, which is
called in [Lev 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#007); [Lev
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018), the fountain of bleeding. The
guilty persons were both of them to be cut off from their nation
according to [Lev 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018), i.e., to be
punished with death.

[Lev 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#020)

"To a neighbour's wife thou shalt not give שׁכבתּך thy pouring as seed"
(i.e., make her pregnant), "to defile thyself with her," viz., by the
emissio seminis ([Lev 15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#016)), a
defilement which was to be punished as adultery by the stoning to death
of both parties ([Lev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010); [Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022), cf. [Joh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005)).

[Lev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021)

To bodily unchastity there is appended a prohibition of spiritual
whoredom. "Thou shalt not give of thy seed to cause to pass through
(sc., the fire; [Deu 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010)) for
Moloch." המּלך is constantly written with the article: it is rendered by
the lxx ἄρχων both here and in [Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002)., but ὁ Μολόχ βασιλεύς in other
places ([Kg2 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010); [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035)). Moloch was an old Canaanitish
idol, called by the Phoenicians and Carthaginians Melkarth, Baal-melech,
Malcom, and other such names, and related to Baal, a sun-god worshipped,
like Kronos and Saturn, by the sacrifice of children. It was represented
by a brazen statue, which was hollow and capable of being heated, and
formed with a bull's head, and arms stretched out to receive the
children to be sacrificed. From the time of Ahaz children were slain at
Jerusalem in the valley of Ben-hinnom, and then sacrificed by being laid
in the heated arms and burned ([Eze
16:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020); [Eze
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031); [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035); [Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010); [Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003); [Kg2
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#017); [Kg2
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#006), cf. [Psa
106:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037)). Now although this offering
of children in the valley of Ben-hinnom is called a "slaughtering" by
Ezekiel ([Eze 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#021)), and a "burning
through (in the) fire" by Jeremiah ([Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031)), and although, in the times of
the later kings, children were actually given up to Moloch and burned as
slain-offerings, even among the Israelites; it by no means follows from
this, that "passing through to Moloch," or "passing through the fire,"
or "passing through the fire to Moloch" ([Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010)), signified slaughtering and
burning with fire, though this has been almost unanimously assumed since
the time of Clericus. But according to the unanimous explanation of the
Rabbins, fathers, and earlier theologians, "causing to pass through the
fire" denoted primarily going through the fire without burning, a
februation, or purification through fire, by which the children were
consecrated to Moloch; a kind of fire-baptism, which preceded the
sacrificing, and was performed, particularly in olden time, without
actual sacrificing, or slaying and burning. For februation was practised
among the most different nations without being connected with human
sacrifices; and, like most of the idolatrous rites of the heathen, no
doubt the worship of Moloch assumed different forms at different times
and among different nations. If the Israelites had really sacrificed
their children to Moloch, i.e., had slain and burned them, before the
time of Ahaz, the burning would certainly have been mentioned before;
for Solomon had built a high place upon the mountain to the east of
Jerusalem for Moloch, the abomination of the children of Ammon, to
please his foreign wives ([Kg1 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007) :
see the Art. Moloch in Herzog's Cycl.). This idolatrous worship was to
be punished with death by stoning, as a desecration of the name of
Jehovah, and a defiling of His sanctuary ([Lev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#003)), i.e., as a practical contempt
of the manifestations of the grace of the living God ([Lev
20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002)).

[Lev 18:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#022)

Lastly, it was forbidden to "lie with mankind as with womankind," i.e.,
to commit the crime of paederastia, that sin of Sodom ([Gen
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#005)), to which the whole of the
heathen were more or less addicted ([Rom
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027)), and from which even the
Israelites did not keep themselves free ([Jdg
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022).); or to "lie with any beast."
"Into no beast shalt thou give thine emission of seed,...and a woman
shall not place herself before a beast to lie down thereto." רבע = רבץ
"to lie," is the term used particularly to denote a crime of this
description ([Lev 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#013) and [Lev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#015), [Lev
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#016), cf. [Exo
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#018)). Lying with animals was
connected in Egypt with the worship of the goat; at Mendes especially,
where the women lay down before he-goats (Herodotus, 2, 46; Strabo, 17,
p. 802). Aelian (nat. an. vii. 19) relates an account of the crime being
also committed with a dog in Rome; and according to Sonnini, R. 11, p.
330, in modern Egypt men are said to lie even with female crocodiles.

[Leviticus 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 18:24</span></span>

In the concluding exhortation God pointed expressly to the fact, that
the nations which He was driving out before the Israelites (the
participle משׁלּח is used of that which is certainly and speedily coming
to pass) had defiled the land by such abominations as those, that He had
visited their iniquity and the land had spat out its inhabitants, and
warned the Israelites to beware of these abominations, that the land
might not spit them out as it had the Canaanites before them. The pret.
ותּקא ([Lev 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025)) and קאה ([Lev
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028)) are prophetic (cf. [Lev
20:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022)), and the expression is
poetical. The land is personified as a living creature, which violently
rejects food that it dislikes. "Hoc enim tropo vult significare
Scriptura enormitatem criminum, quod scilicet ipsae creaturae
irrationales suo creatori semper obedientes et pro illo pugnantes
detestentur peccatores tales eosque terra quasi evomat, cum illi
expelluntur ab ea" (C. a Lap.).
