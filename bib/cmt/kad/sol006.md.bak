### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 6:1</span></span>

The daughters of Jerusalem now offer to seek along with Shulamith for
her beloved, who had turned away and was gone.

1 Whither has thy beloved gone,

Thou fairest of women?

Whither has thy beloved turned,

That we may seek him with thee?

The longing remains with her even after she has wakened, as the after
effect of her dream. In the morning she goes forth and meets with the
daughters of Jerusalem. They cause Shulamith to describe her friend, and
they ask whither he has gone. They wish to know the direction in which
he disappeared from her, the way which he had probably taken (פנה, R. פן
.R, to drive, to urge forward, to turn from one to another), that with
her they might go to seek him (Vav of the consequence or the object, as
at [Psa 83:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#017).md). The answer she gives
proceeds on a conclusion which she draws from the inclination of her
beloved.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 6:2</span></span>

2 My beloved has gone down into the garden,

To the beds of sweet herbs,

To feed in the gardens

And gather lilies.

He is certainly, she means to say, there to be found where he delights
most to tarry. He will have gone down - viz. from the palace ([Sol
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011.md); cf. [Kg1
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#043.md) and [Est
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#007).md) - into his garden, to the
fragrant beds, there to feed in his garden and gather lilies (cf. Old
Germ. "to collect rsen"); he is fond of gardens and flowers. Shulamith
expresses this in her shepherd-dialect, as when Jesus says of His Father
([Joh 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001).md), "He is the husbandman."
Flowerbeds are the feeding place (vid., regarding לרעות under [Sol
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016).md) of her beloved. Solomon
certainly took great delight in gardens and parks, [Ecc
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md). But this historical fact is here
idealized; the natural flora which Solomon delighted in with intelligent
interest presents itself as a figure of a higher Loveliness which was
therein as it were typically manifest (cf. [Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md), where the "Lamb," "feeding," and
"fountains of water," are applied as anagogics, i.e.,
heavenward-pointing types). Otherwise it is not to be comprehended why
it is lilies that are named. Even if it were supposed to be implied that
lilies were Solomon's favourite flowers, we must assume that his taste
was determined by something more than by form and colour. The words of
Shulamith give us to understand that the inclination and the favourite
resort of her friend corresponded to his nature, which is altogether
thoughtfulness and depth of feeling (cf. under [Psa
92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md), the reference to Dante: the
beautiful women who gather flowers representing the paradisaical life);
lilies, the emblems of unapproachable grandeur, purity inspiring
reverence, high elevation above that which is common, bloom there
wherever the lily-like one wanders, whom the lily of the valley calls
her own. With the words:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 6:3</span></span>

3 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine,

Who feeds among the lilies,

Shulamith farther proceeds, followed by the daughters of Jerusalem, to
seek her friend lost through her own fault. She always says, not אישׁי,
but דּודי and רעי; for love, although a passion common to mind and body,
is in this Song of Songs viewed as much as possible apart from its basis
in the animal nature. Also, that the description hovers between that of
the clothed and the unclothed, gives to it an ideality favourable to the
mystical interpretation. Nakedness is ערוה. But at the cross nakedness
appears transported from the sphere of sense to that of the
supersensuous.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 6:4</span></span>

With [Sol 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md) Solomon's address is
resumed, and a new scene opens. Shulamith had found him again, and she
who is beautiful in herself appears now so much the more beautiful, when
the joy of seeing him again irradiates her whole being.

4 Beautiful art thou, my friend, as Tirzah,

Comely as Jerusalem,

Terrible as a battle-array.

In the praise of her beauty we hear the voice of the king. The cities
which are the highest ornament of his kingdom serve him as the measure
of her beauty, which is designated according to the root conceptions by
יפה, after the equality of completeness; by נאוה, after the quality of
that which is well-becoming, pleasing. It is concluded, from the
prominence given to Tirzah, that the Song was not composed till after
the division of the kingdom, and that its author was an inhabitant of
the northern kingdom; for Tirzah was the first royal city of this
kingdom till the time of Omri, the founder of Samaria. But since, at all
events, it is Solomon who here speaks, so great an historical judgment
ought surely to be ascribed to a later poet who has imagined himself in
the exact position of Solomon, that he would not represent the king of
the undivided Israel as speaking like a king of the separate kingdom of
Israel. The prominence given to Tirzah has another reason. Tirzah was
discovered by Robinson on his second journey, 1852, in which Van de
Velde accompanied him, on a height in the mountain range to the north of
Nabls, under the name Tullzah. Brocardus and Breydenback had already
pointed out a village called Thersa to the east of Samaria. This form of
the name corresponds to the Heb. better than that Arab. Tullûzah; but
the place is suitable, and if Tullzah lies high and beautiful in a
region of olive trees, then it still justifies its ancient name, which
means pleasantness or sweetness. But it cannot be sweetness on account
of which Tirzah is named before Jerusalem, for in the eye of the
Israelites Jerusalem was "the perfection of beauty" ([Psa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002.md); [Lam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015).md). That there is gradation from
Tirzah to Jerusalem (Hengst.) cannot be said; for נאוה (decora) and יפה
(pulchra) would be reversed if a climax were intended. The reason of it
is rather this, that Shulamith is from the higher region, and is not a
daughter of Jerusalem, and that therefore a beautiful city situated in
the north toward Sunem must serve as a comparison of her beauty. That
Shulamith is both beautiful and terrible (אימּה from אים) is not
contradiction: she is terrible in the irresistible power of the
impression of her personality, terrible as nîdgaloth, i.e., as troops
going forth with their banners unfurled (cf. the Kal of this v. denom.,
[Psa 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006).md). We do not need to supply
מצנות, which is sometimes fem., [Psa
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#003.md); [Gen
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md), although the attribute would
here be appropriate, [Num 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003.md), cf.
Song [Num 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#005.md); still less צבאות,
which occurs in the sense of military service, [Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002.md), and a war-expedition, [Dan
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012.md), but not in the sense of
war-host, as fem. Much rather nidgaloth, thus neut., is meant of
bannered hosts, as ארחות (not אר), [Isa
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md), of those that are marching.
War-hosts with their banners, their standards, go forth confident of
victory. Such is Shulamith's whole appearance, although she is
unconscious of it - a veni, vidi, vici. Solomon is completely vanquished
by her. But seeking to maintain himself in freedom over against her, he
cries out to her:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 6:5</span></span>

5a Turn away thine eyes from me,

For overpoweringly they assail me.

Dpke translates, ferocire me faciunt; Hengst.: they make me proud; but
although הרהיב, after [Psa 138:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#003.md), may
be thus used, yet that would be an effect produced by the eyes, which
certainly would suggest the very opposite of the request to turn them
away. The verb רהב means to be impetuous, and to press impetuously
against any one; the Hiph. is the intens. of this trans. signification
of the Kal: to press overpoweringly against one, to infuse terror,
terrorem incutere. The lxx translates it by ἀναπτεροῦν, which is also
used of the effect of terror ("to make to start up"), and the Syr. by
afred, to put to flight, because arheb signifies to put in fear, as also
arhab = khawwaf, terrefacere; but here the meaning of the verb
corresponds more with the sense of Arab. r''b, to be placed in the state
of ro'b, i.e., of paralyzing terror. If she directed her large, clear,
penetrating eyes to him, he must sink his own: their glance is
unbearable by him. This peculiar form the praise of her eyes here
assume; but then the description proceeds as at [Sol
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md), [Sol
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md). The words used there in praise of
her hair, her teeth, and her cheeks, are here repeated.

5b Thy hair is like a flock of goats

Which repose downwards on Giliad.

6 Thy teeth like a flock of lambs

Which come up from the washing,

All of them bearing twins,

And a bereaved one is not among them.

7 Like a piece of pomegranate thy temples

Behind thy veil.

The repetition is literal, but yet not without change in the expression,
- there, גל מהר, here, מן־הגּל; there, הקּץ, tonsarum, here, הרח,
agnarum (Symm., Venet. τῶν ἀμνάδων); for רחל, in its proper
signification, is like the Arab. rachil, richl, richleh, the female
lamb, and particularly the ewe. Hitzig imagines that Solomon here
repeats to Shulamith what he had said to another donna chosen for
marriage, and that the flattery becomes insipid by repetition to
Shulamith, as well as also to the reader. But the romance which he finds
in the Song is not this itself, but his own palimpsest, in the style of
Lucian's transformed ass. The repetition has a morally better reason,
and not one so subtle. Shulamith appears to Solomon yet more beautiful
than on the day when she was brought to him as his bride. His love is
still the same, unchanged; and this both she and the reader or hearer
must conclude from these words of praise, repeated now as they were
then. There is no one among the ladies of the court whom he prefers to
her, - these must themselves acknowledge her superiority.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 6:8</span></span>

8 There are sixty queens,

And eighty concubines,

And virgins without number.

9 One is my dove, my perfect one, -

The only one of her mother,

The choice one of her that bare her.

The daughters saw her and called her blessed, -

Queens and concubines, and they extolled her.

Even here, where, if anywhere, notice of the difference of gender was to
be expected, המּה stands instead of the more accurate הנּה (e.g., [Gen
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002).md). The number off the women of
Solomon's court, [Kg1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#003.md), is far
greater (700 wives and 300 concubines); and those who deny the Solomonic
authorship of the Song regard the poet, in this particular, as more
historical than the historian. On our part, holding as we do the
Solomonic authorship of the book, we conclude from these low numbers
that the Song celebrates a love-relation of Solomon's at the
commencement of his reign: his luxury had not then reached the enormous
height to which he, the same Solomon, looks back, and which he
designates, [Ecc 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md), as vanitas
vanitatum. At any rate, the number of 60 מלכות, i.e., legitimate wives
of equal rank with himself, is yet high enough; for, according to [Ch2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021.md), Rehoboam had 18 wives and 60
concubines. The 60 occurred before, at [Sol
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007.md). If it be a round number, as
sometimes, although rarely, sexaginta is thus used (Hitzig), it may be
reduced only to 51, but not further, especially here, where 80 stands
along with it. פילגשׁ (פּלּגשׁ), Gr. πάλλαξ παλλακή (Lat. pellex), which
in the form פּלּקתּא (פּלקתא) came back from the Greek to the Aramaic,
is a word as yet unexplained. According to the formation, it may be
compared to חרמשׁ, from חרם, to cut off; whence also the harem bears the
(Arab.) name ḥaram, or the separated synaeconitis, to which access is
denied. And ending in is (ש) is known to the Assyr., but only as an
adverbial ending, which, as 'istinis = לבדּו, alone, solus, shows is
connected with the pron. su. These two nouns appear as thus requiring to
be referred to quadrilitera, with the annexed שׁ; perhaps פלגשׁ, in the
sense of to break into splinters, from פּלג, to divide (whence a brook,
as dividing itself in its channels, has the name of פּלג), points to the
polygamous relation as a breaking up of the marriage of one; so that a
concubine has the name pillěgěsh, as a representant of polygamy in
contrast to monogamy.

In the first line of [Sol 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md) אחת is
subj. (one, who is my dove, my perfect one); in the second line, on the
contrary, it is pred. (one, unica, is she of her mother). That Shulamith
was her mother's only child does not, however, follow from this; אחת,
unica, is equivalent to unice dilecta, as יחיד, [Pro
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003.md), is equivalent to unice dilectus
(cf. Keil's [Zac 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#007).md). The parall.
בּרה has its nearest signification electa (lxx, Syr., Jerome), not pura
(Venet.); the fundamental idea of cutting and separating divides itself
into the ideas of choosing and purifying. The Aorists, [Sol
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md), are the only ones in this book;
they denote that Shulamith's look had, on the part of the women, this
immediate result, that they willingly assigned to her the good fortune
of being preferred to them all, - that to her the prize was due. The
words, as also at [Pro 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#028.md), are an
echo of [Gen 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#013.md), - the books of the
Chokma delight in references to Genesis, the book of pre-Israelitish
origin. Here, in [Sol 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008.md), [Sol
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md), the distinction between our
typical and the allegorical interpretation is correctly seen. The latter
is bound to explain what the 60 and the 80 mean, and how the wives,
concubines, and "virgins" of the harem are to be distinguished from each
other; but what till now has been attempted in this matter has, by
reason of its very absurdity or folly, become an easy subject of wanton
mockery. But the typical interpretation regards the 60 and the 80, and
the unreckoned number, as what their names denote, - viz. favourites,
concubines, and serving-maids. But to see an allegory of heavenly things
in such a herd of women - a kind of thing which the Book of Genesis
dates from the degradation of marriage in the line of Cain - is a
profanation of that which is holy. The fact is, that by a violation of
the law of God ([Deu 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017).md), Solomon
brings a cloud over the typical representation, which is not at all to
be thought of in connection with the Antitype. Solomon, as Jul Sturm
rightly remarks, is not to be considered by himself, but only in his
relation to Shulamith. In Christ, on the contrary, is no imperfection;
sin remains in the congregation. In the Song, the bride is purer than
the bridegroom; but in the fulfilling of the Song this relation is
reversed: the bridegroom is purer than the bride.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 6:10</span></span>

10 Who is this that looketh forth like the morning-red,

Beautiful as the moon, pure as the sun,

Terrible as a battle-host?

The question, "Who is this?" is the same as at [Sol
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006.md). There, it refers to her who was
brought to the king; here, it refers to her who moves in that which is
his as her own. There, the "this" is followed by עלה appositionally;
here, by הנּשׁ looking forth determ., and thus more closely connected
with it; but then indeterm., and thus apposit. predicates follow. The
verb שׁקף signifies to bend forward, to overhang; whence the Hiph.
השׁקיף and Niph. שׁקף, to look out, since in doing so one bends forward
(vid., under [Psa 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002).md). The lxx here
translates it by ἐκκύπτουσα, the Venet. by παρακύπτουσα, both of which
signify to look toward something with the head inclined forward. The
point of comparison is, the rising up from the background: Shulamith
breaks through the shades of the garden-grove like the morning-red, the
morning dawn; or, also: she comes nearer and nearer, as the morning-red
rises behind the mountains, and then fills always the more widely the
whole horizon. The Venet. translates ὡς ἑωσφόρος; but the morning star
is not שׁחר, but בּן־שׁחר, [Isa 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md);
shahhar, properly, the morning-dawn, means, in Heb., not only this, like
the Arab. shaḥar, but rather, like the Arab. fajr, the morning-red, -
i.e., the red tinge of the morning mist. From the morning-red the
description proceeds to the moon, yet visible in the morning sky, before
the sun has risen. It is usually called ירח, as being yellow; but here
it is called לבנה, as being white; as also the sun, which here is spoken
of as having risen ([Jdg 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#031).md), is
designated not by the word שׁמשׁ, as the unwearied ([Psa
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006.md), [Psa
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006).md), but, on account of the
intensity of its warming light ([Psa
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007).md), is called חמּה. These, in the
language of poetry, are favourite names of the moon and the sun, because
already the primitive meaning of the two other names had disappeared
from common use; but with these, definite attributive ideas are
immediately connected. Shulamith appears like the morning-red, which
breaks through the darkness; beautiful, like the silver moon, which in
soft still majesty shines in the heavens ([Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026).md); pure (vid., regarding בּר,
בּרוּר in this signification: smooth, bright, pure under Isa.[Isa
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002).md) as the sun, whose light (cf.
טהור with the Aram. מיהרא, mid-day brightness) is the purest of the
pure, imposing as war-hosts with their standards (vid., [Sol
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004).md). The answer of her who was
drawing near, to this exclamation, sounds homely and childlike:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 6:11</span></span>

11 To the nut garden I went down

To look at the shrubs of the valley,

To see whether the vine sprouted,

The pomegranates budded.

12 I knew it not that my soul lifted me up

To the royal chariots of my people, a noble (one).

In her loneliness she is happy; she finds her delight in quietly moving
about in the vegetable world; the vine and the pomegranate, brought from
her home, are her favourites. Her soul - viz. love for Solomon, which
fills her soul - raised her to the royal chariots of her people, the
royal chariots of a noble (one), where she sits besides the king, who
drives the chariot; she knew this, but she also knew it not for what she
had become without any cause of her own, that she is without
self-elation and without disavowal of her origin. These are Shulamith's
thoughts and feelings, which we think we derive from these two verses
without reading between the lines and without refining. It went down,
she says, viz., from the royal palace, cf. [Sol
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002.md). Then, further, she speaks of a
valley; and the whole sounds rural, so that we are led to think of Etam
as the scene. This Etam, romantically (vid., [Jdg
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#008) f..md) situated, was, as Josephus
(Antt. viii. 7. 3) credibly informs us, Solomon's Belvedere. "In the
royal stables," he says, "so great was the regard for beauty and
swiftness, that nowhere else could horses of greater beauty or greater
fleetness be found. All had to acknowledge that the appearance of the
king's horses was wonderfully pleasing, and that their swiftness was
incomparable. Their riders also served as an ornament to them. They were
young men in the flower of their age, and were distinguished by their
lofty stature and their flowing hair, and by their clothing, which was
of Tyrian purple. They every day sprinkled their hair with dust of gold,
so that their whole head sparkled when the sun shone upon it. In such
array, armed and bearing bows, they formed a body-guard around the king,
who was wont, clothed in a white garment, to go out of the city in the
morning, and even to drive his chariot. These morning excursions were
usually to a certain place which was about sixty stadia from Jerusalem,
and which was called Etam; gardens and brooks made it as pleasant as it
was fruitful." This Etam, from whence (the עין עיטם)

(Note: According to Sebachim 54b, one of the highest points of the Holy
Land.))

a watercourse, the ruins of which are still visible, supplied the temple
with water, has been identified by Robinson with a village called Artas
(by Lumley called Urtas), about a mile and a half to the south of
Bethlehem. At the upper end of the winding valley, at a considerable
height above the bottom, are three old Solomonic pools, - large, oblong
basins of considerable compass placed one behind the other in terraces.
Almost at an equal height with the highest pool, at a distance of
several hundred steps there is a strong fountain, which is carefully
built over, and to which there is a descent by means of stairs inside
the building. By it principally were the pools, which are just large
reservoirs, fed, and the water was conducted by a subterranean conduit
into the upper pool. Riding along the way close to the aqueduct, which
still exists, one sees even at the present day the valley below clothed
in rich vegetation; and it is easy to understand that here there may
have been rich gardens and pleasure-grounds (Moritz Lttke's
Mittheilung). A more suitable place for this first scene of the fifth
Act cannot be thought of; and what Josephus relates serves remarkably to
illustrate not only the description of [Sol
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011.md), but also that of [Sol
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012.md).

אגוז is the walnut, i.e., the Italian nut tree (Juglans regia L.),
originally brought from Persia; the Persian name is jeuz, Aethiop. gûz,
Arab. Syr. gauz (gôz), in Heb. with א prosth., like the Armen. engus.
גּנּת אגוז is a garden, the peculiar ornament of which is the fragrant
and shady walnut tree; גנת אגוזים would not be a nut garden, but a
garden of nuts, for the plur. signifies, Mishn. nuces (viz., juglandes =
Jovis glandes, Pliny, xvii. 136, ed. Jan.), as תּאנים, figs, in
contradistinction to תּאנה, a fig tree, only the Midrash uses אגוזה
here, elsewhere not occurring, of a tree. The object of her going down
was one, viz., to observe the state of the vegetation; but it was
manifold, as expressed in the manifold statements which follow ירדתּי.
The first object was the nut garden. Then her intention was to observe
the young shoots in the valley, which one has to think of as traversed
by a river or brook; for נחל, like Wady, signifies both a valley and a
valley-brook. The nut garden might lie in the valley, for the walnut
tree is fond of a moderately cool, damp soil (Joseph. Bell. iii. 10. 8).
But the אבּי are the young shoots with which the banks of a brook and
the damp valley are usually adorned in the spring-time. אב, shoot, in
the Heb. of budding and growth, in Aram. of the fruit-formation, comes
from R. אב, the weaker power of נב, which signifies to expand and spread
from within outward, and particularly to sprout up and to well forth. ב
ראה signifies here, as at [Gen 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#001.md),
attentively to observe something, looking to be fixed upon it, to sink
down into it. A further object was to observe whether the vine had
broken out, or had budded (this is the meaning of פּרח, breaking out, to
send forth, R. פר, to break),

(Note: Vid., Friedh. Delitzsch, Indo-Germ. Sem. Studien, p. 72.)

\- whether the pomegranate trees had gained flowers or flower-buds
הנצוּ, not as Gesen. in his Thes. and Heb. Lex. states, the Hiph. of
נוּץ, which would be הניצוּ, but from נצץ instead of הנצוּ, with the
same omission of Dagesh, after the forms הפרוּ, הרעוּ, cf. [Pro
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#013.md), R. נץ נס, to glance, bloom
(whence Nisan as the name of the flower-month, as Ab the name of the
fruit-month).

(Note: Cf. my Jesurun, p. 149.)

Why the pomegranate tree (Punica granatum L.), which derives this its
Latin name from its fruit being full of grains, bears the Semitic name
of רמּון, (Arab.) rummân, is yet unexplained; the Arabians are so little
acquainted with it, that they are uncertain whether ramm or raman
(which, however, is not proved to exist) is to be regarded as the
root-word. The question goes along with that regarding the origin and
signification of Rimmon, the name of the Syrian god, which appears to
denote

(Note: An old Chald. king is called Rim-Sin; rammu is common in proper
names, as Ab-rammu.)

"sublimity;" and it is possible that the pomegranate tree has its name
from this god as being consecrated to him.

(Note: The name scarcely harmonizes with רמּה, worm, although the
pomegranate suffers from worm-holes; the worm which pierces it bears the
strange name (דרימוני) הה, Shabbath 90a.)

In [Sol 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012.md), Shulamith adds that,
amid this her quiet delight in contemplating vegetable life, she had
almost forgotten the position to which she had been elevated. ידעתּי לא
may, according to the connection in which it is sued, mean, "I know
not," [Gen 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#009.md); [Gen
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#026.md), as well as "I knew not," [Gen
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016.md); [Pro
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#035.md); here the latter (lxx, Aquila,
Jerome, Venet., Luther), for the expression runs parallel to ירדתי, and
is related to it as verifying or circumstantiating it. The connection לא
יד נפשי, whether we take the word נפשי as permut. of the subject
(Luther: My soul knew it not) or as the accus. of the object: I knew not
myself (after [Job 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#021).md), is
objectionable, because it robs the following שׂמתני of its subject, and
makes the course of thought inappropriate. The accusative, without
doubt, hits on what is right, since it gives the Rebia, corresponding to
our colon, to יד; for that which follows with נפשׁי שׂם is just what she
acknowledges not to have known or considered. For the meaning cannot be
that her soul had placed or brought her in an unconscious way, i.e.,
involuntarily or unexpectedly, etc., for "I knew not,"as such a
declaration never forms the principal sentence, but, according to the
nature of the case, always a subordinate sentence, and that either as a
conditional clause with Vav, [Job 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#005.md),
or as a relative clause, [Isa 47:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#011.md);
cf. Ps. 49:21. Thus "I knew not" will be followed by what she was
unconscious of; it follows in oratio directa instead of obliqua, as also
elsewhere after ידע, כּי, elsewhere introducing the object of knowledge,
is omitted, Ps. 9:21; [Amo 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012.md). But
if it remains unknown to her, if it has escaped her consciousness that
her soul placed her, etc., then naphsi is here her own self, and that on
the side of desire ([Job 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013.md); [Deu
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015).md); thus, in contrast to external
constraint, her own most inward impulse, the leading of her heart.
Following this, she has been placed on the height on which she now finds
herself, without being always mindful of it. It would certainly now be
most natural to regard מרכּבות, after the usual constr. of the verb
שׂוּם with the double accus., e.g., [Gen
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022.md); [Isa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002.md); [Psa
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009.md), as pred. accus. (Venet. ἔθετό με
ὀχήματα), as e.g., Hengst.: I knew not, thus my soul brought me (i.e.,
brought me at unawares) to the chariots of my people, who are noble. But
what does this mean? He adds the remark: "Shulamith stands in the place
of the war-chariots of her people as their powerful protector, or by the
heroic spirit residing in her." But apart from the syntactically false
rendering of ידעתי לא, and the unwarrantable allegorizing, this
interpretation wrecks itself on this, that "chariots" in themselves are
not for protection, and thus without something further, especially in
this designation by the word מרכבות, and not by רכב ([Kg2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017.md); cf. [Kg2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012.md); [Kg2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014).md), are not war-chariots. מר will
thus be the accus of the object of motion. It is thus understood, e.g.,
by Ewald (sec. 281d): My soul brought me to the chariots, etc. The
shepherd-hypothesis finds here the seduction of Shulamith. Hollnder
translates: "I perceived it not; suddenly, it can scarcely be said
unconsciously, I was placed in the state-chariots of Amminidab." But the
Masora expressly remarks that עמי נדיב are not to be read as if forming
one, but as two words, תרין מלין.

(Note: עמּי־נדיב, thus in D F: עמּי, without the accent and connected
with נדיב by Makkeph. On the contrary, P has עמּינדיב as one word, as
also the Masora parva has here noted חדה מלה. Our Masora, however, notes
לית ותרתין כתיבין, and thus Rashi and Aben Ezra testify.)

Hitzig proportionally better, thus: without any apprehension of such a
coincidence, she saw herself carried to the chariots of her noble
people, i.e., as Gesen. in his Thes.: inter currus comitatus principis.
Any other explanation, says Hitzig, is not possible, since the accus.
מרך in itself signifies only in the direction wither, or in the
neighbourhood whence. And certainly it is generally used of the aim or
object toward which one directs himself or strives, e.g., [Isa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023.md). Koděsh, "toward the sanctuary,"
[Psa 134:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002.md); cf. hashshā'rā, "toward
the gate," [Isa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#007.md). But the accus.
mārom can also mean "on high," [Isa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#016.md), the accus. hashshāmaīm "in the
heavens," [Kg1 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#032.md); and as shalahh
hāārets of being sent into the land, [Num
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027.md), thus may also sīm měrkāvāh be
used for sim beměrkāvāh, [Sa1 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011.md),
according to which the Syr. (bemercabto) and the Quinta (εἰς ἃρματα)
translate; on the contrary, Symm. and Jerome destroy the meaning by
adopting the reading שׁמּתני (my soul placed me in confusion). The plur.
markevoth is thus meant amplifi., like richvē, [Sol
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md), and battēnu, [Sol
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#017.md).

As regards the subject, [Sa2 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md) is
to be compared; it is the king's chariot that is meant, yoked, according
to [Sol 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md), with Egypt. horses. It is
a question whether nadiv is related adject. to ammi: my people, a noble
(people), - a connection which gives prominence to the attribute
appositionally, [Gen 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#002.md); [Psa
143:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#010.md); [Eze
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md), - or permutat., so that the
first gen. is exchanged for one defining more closely: to the royal
chariot of my people, a prince. The latter has the preference, not
merely because (leaving out of view the proper name Amminidab) wherever
עם and נדיב are used together they are meant of those who stand
prominent above the people, [Num
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#018.md), Ps. 47:10; [Psa
113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008.md), but because this נדיב and
בּת־נדיב evidently stand in interchangeable relation. Yet, even though
we take נדיב and עמי together, the thought remains the same. Shulamith
is not one who is abducted, but, as we read at [Sol
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006.md) ff., one who is honourably brought
home; and she here expressly says that no kind of external force but her
own loving soul raised her to the royal chariots of her people and their
king. That she gives to the fact of her elevation just this expression,
arises from the circumstance that she places her joy in the loneliness
of nature, in contrast to her driving along in a splendid chariot.
Designating the chariot that of her noble people, or that of her people,
and, indeed, of a prince, she sees in both cases in Solomon the
concentration and climax of the people's glory.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 6:13</span></span>

Encouraged by Shulamith's unassuming answer, the daughters of Jerusalem
now give utterance to an entreaty which their astonishment at her beauty
suggests to them.

13 Come back, come back, O Shulamith!

Come back, come back, that we may look upon thee!

She is now ([Sol 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010)..md) on the way
from the garden to the palace. The fourfold "come back" entreats her
earnestly, yea, with tears, to return thither with them once more, and
for this purpose, that they might find delight in looking up her; for ב
חזה signifies to sink oneself into a thing, looking at it, to delight
(feast) one's eyes in looking on a thing. Here for the first time
Shulamith is addressed by name. But השּׁוּ cannot be a pure proper name,
for the art. is vocat., as e.g., הבּת ירו, "O daughter of Jerusalem!"
Pure proper names like שׁלמה are so determ. in themselves that they
exclude the article; only such as are at the same time also nouns, like
ירדּן and לבנון, are susceptible of the article, particularly also of
the vocat., [Psa 114:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#005.md); but cf. [Zac
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001.md) with [Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034.md). Thus השּׁוּ will be not so much
a proper name as a name of descent, as generally nouns in (with a few
exceptions, viz., of ordinal number, הררי, ימני, etc.) are all
gentilicia. The lxx render השׁו by ἡ Σουναμῖτις, and this is indeed but
another form for השּׁוּנמּית, i.e., she who is from Sunem. Thus also was
designated the exceedingly beautiful Abishag, [Kg1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#003.md), Elisha's excellent and pious
hostess, [Kg2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md) ff. Sunem was in the
tribe of Issachar ([Jos 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018).md), near
to Little Hermon, from which it was separated by a valley, to the
south-east of Carmel. This lower Galilean Sunem, which lies south from
Nain, south-east from Nazareth, south-west from Tabor, is also called
Shulem. Eusebius in his Onomasticon says regarding it: Σουβήμ (l.
Σουλήμ) κλήρου Ισσάχαρ καὶ νῦν ἐστὶ κώμη Σουλὴμ κ.τ.λ., i.e., as Jerome
translates it: Sunem in tribue Issachar. et usque hodie vicus ostenditur
nomine Sulem in quinto miliario montis Thabor contra australum plagam.
This place if found at the present day under the name of Suwlam (Slam),
at the west end of Jebel ed-Duhi (Little Hermon), not far from the great
plain (Jisre'el, now Zer'n), which forms a convenient way of
communication between Jordan and the sea-coast, but is yet so hidden in
the mountain range that the Talmud is silent concerning this Sulem, as
it is concerning Nazareth. Here was the home of the Shulamitess of the
Song. The ancients interpret the name by εἰρημεύουσα, or by ἐσκυλευμένη
(vid., Lagarde's Onomastica), the former after Aquila and the Quinta,
the latter after Symm. The Targum has the interpretation: השׁלמה באמונתה
עם ה (vid., Rashi). But the form of the name (the Syr. writes
שׁילוּמיתא) is opposed to these allegorical interpretations. Rather it
is to be assumed that the poet purposely used, not hshwb', but hshwl',
to assimilate her name to that of Solomon; and that it has the parallel
meaning of one devoted to Solomon, and thus, as it were, of a
passively-applied שׁלומית = Σαλόμη, is the more probable, as the
daughters of Jerusalem would scarcely venture thus to address her who
was raised to the rank of a princess unless this name accorded with that
of Solomon.

Not conscious of the greatness of her beauty, Shulamith asks -

1ba What do you see in Shulamith?

She is not aware that anything particular is to be seen in her; but the
daughters of Jerusalem are of a different opinion, and answer this
childlike, modest, but so much the more touching question -

1bb As the dance of Mahanaim!

They would thus see in her something like the dance of Manahaaοm. If
this be here the name of the Levitical town (now Mahneh) in the tribe of
Gad, north of Jabbok, where Ishbosheth resided for two years, and where
David was hospitably entertained on his flight from Absalom (Luthr.:
"the dance to Mahanaaοm"), then we must suppose in this trans-Jordanic
town such a popular festival as was kept in Shiloh, [Jdg
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019.md), and we may compare Abel-meholah
= meadow of dancing, the name of Elisha's birth-place (cf. also Herod.
i. 16: "To dance the dance of the Arcadian town of Tegea"). But the Song
delights in retrospective references to Genesis (cf. [Gen
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#011.md), [Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011).md). At [Gen
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#003.md), however, by Mahanaaοm

(Note: Bφttcher explains Mahanaaοm as a plur.; but the plur. of מצנה is
מצנות and מחנים; the plur. termination ajim is limited to מים and
שׁמים.)

is meant the double encampment of angels who protected Jacob's two
companies ([Gen 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#008).md). The town of
Mahanaam derives its name from this vision of Jacob's. The word, as the
name of a town, is always without the article; and here, where it has
the article, it is to be understood appellatively. The old translators,
in rendering by "the dances of the camps" (Syr., Jerome, choros
castrorum, Venet. θίασον στρατοπέδων), by which it remains uncertain
whether a war-dance or a parade is meant, overlook the dual, and by
exchanging מחנים with מצנות, they obtain a figure which in this
connection is incongruous and obscure. But, in truth, the figure is an
angelic one. The daughters of Jerusalem wish to see Shulamith dance, and
they designate that as an angelic sight. Mahanaam became in the
post-bibl. dialect a name directly for angels. The dance of angels is
only a step beyond the responsive song of the seraphim, [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md). Engelkoere angel-choir and
"heavenly host" are associated in the old German poetry.

(Note: Vid., Walther von der Vogelweide, 173. 28. The Indian mythology
goes farther, and transfers not only the original of the dance, but also
of the drama, to heaven; vid., Gtting. Anziegen, 1874, p. 106.)

The following description is undeniably that (let one only read how
Hitzig in vain seeks to resist this interpretation) of one dancing. In
this, according to biblical representation and ancient custom, there is
nothing repulsive. The women of the ransomed people, with Miriam at
their head, danced, as did also the women who celebrated David's victory
over Goliath ([Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md); [Sa1
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006)). David himself danced (2 Sam 6.md)
before the ark of the covenant. Joy and dancing are, according to Old
Testament conception, inseparable ([Ecc
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#004).md); and joy not only as the happy
feeling of youthful life, but also spiritual holy joy ([Psa
87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007).md). The dance which the ladies of
the court here desire to see, falls under the point of view of a play of
rival individual artistes reciprocally acting for the sake of amusement.
The play also is capable of moral nobility, if it is enacted within the
limits of propriety, at the right time, in the right manner, and if the
natural joyfulness, penetrated by intelligence, is consecrated by a
spiritual aim. Thus Shulamith, when she dances, does not then become a
Gaditanian (Martial, xiv. 203) or an Alma (the name given in Anterior
Asia to those women who go about making it their business to dance mimic
and partly lascivious dances); nor does she become a Bajadere ([Isa
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015) f..md),

(Note: Alma is the Arab. 'ualmah (one skilled, viz., in dancing and
jonglerie), and Bajadere is the Portug. softening of baladera, a dancer,
from balare (ballare), mediaev. Lat., and then Romanic: to move in a
circle, to dance.)

as also Miriam, [Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md), Jephthah's
daughter, [Jdg 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md), the "daughters
of Shiloh," [Jdg 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#021.md), and the woman
of Jerusalem, [Sa1 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006.md), did not
dishonour themselves by dancing; the dancing of virgins is even a
feature of the times after the restoration, [Jer
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#013.md). But that Shulamith actually
danced in compliance with the earnest entreaty of the daughters of
Jerusalem, is seen from the following description of her attractions,
which begins with her feet and the vibration of her thighs.

After throwing aside her upper garments, so that she had only the light
clothing of a shepherdess or vinedresser, Shulamith danced to and fro
before the daughters of Jerusalem, and displayed all her attractions
before them. Her feet, previously ([Sol
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#003).md) naked, or as yet only shod with
sandals, she sets forth with the deportment of a prince's daughter.
