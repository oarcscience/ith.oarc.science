### [Zechariah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 14:1</span></span>

All nations will be gathered together by the Lord against Jerusalem, and
will take the city and plunder it, and lead away the half of its
inhabitants into captivity ([Zac 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md),
[Zac 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md). The Lord will then take
charge of His people; He will appear upon the Mount of Olives, and by
splitting this mountain, prepare a safe way for the rescue of those that
remain, and come with all His saints ([Zac
14:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003).md) to complete His kingdom. From
Jerusalem a stream of salvation and blessing will pour over the whole
land ([Zac 14:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006).md); the enemies who
have come against Jerusalem will be miraculously smitten, and destroy
one another ([Zac 14:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012).md). The
remnant of the nations, however, will turn to the Lord, and come yearly
to Jerusalem, to keep the feast of Tabernacles ([Zac
14:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016).md); and Jerusalem will become
thoroughly holy ([Zac 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md), [Zac
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021).md). From this brief description of
the contents, it is perfectly obvious that our chapter contains simply a
further expansion of the summary announcement of the judgment upon
Israel, and its refinement ([Zac
13:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007).md). [Zac
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md), [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md) show how the flock is dispersed,
and for the most part perishes; [Zac
14:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md), how the Lord brings back His
hand over the small ones; vv. 6-21, how the rescued remnant of the
nation is endowed with salvation, and the kingdom of God completed by
the reception of the believers out of the heathen nations. There is no
essential difference in the fact that the nation of Israel is the object
of the prophecy in [Zac 13:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md), and
Jerusalem in ch. 14. Jerusalem, as the capital of the kingdom, is the
seat of Israel, the nation of God; what happens to it, happens to the
people and kingdom of God.

[Zac 14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md)

The judgment and the deliverance. - [Zac
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md). "Behold, a day cometh for
Jehovah, and thy spoil is divided in the midst of thee. [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md). And I will gather all nations
against Jerusalem to war, and the city will be taken, and the houses
plundered, and the women ravished, and half the city will go out into
captivity; but the remnant of the nation will not be cut off out of the
city." A day comes to the Lord, not inasmuch as He brings it to pass,
but rather because the day belongs to Him, since He will manifest His
glory upon it (cf. [Isa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012).md). This
day will at first bring calamity or destruction upon Israel; but this
calamity will furnish occasion to the Lord to display His divine might
and glory, by destroying the enemies of Israel and saving His people. In
the second hemistich of [Zac 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md),
Jerusalem is addressed. "Thy spoil" is the booty taken by the enemy in
Jerusalem. The prophet commences directly with the main fact, in a most
vivid description, and only gives the explanation afterwards in [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md). The Vav consec. attached to
ואספתּי is also a Vav explicativum. The Lord gathers all nations
together to war against Jerusalem, and gives up the city into their
power, that they may conquer it, and let loose all their barbarity upon
it, plundering the houses and ravishing the women (cf. [Isa
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016.md), where the same thing is
affirmed of Babylon). Just as in the Chaldaean conquest the people had
been obliged to wander into captivity, so will it be now, though not all
the people, but only the half of the city. The remaining portion will
not be cut off out of the city, i.e., be transported thence, as was the
case at that time, when even the remnant of the nation was carried into
exile ([Kg2 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022).md). It is obvious at
once from this, that the words do not refer to the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Romans, as Theodoret, Jerome, and others have supposed.

[Zac 14:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003.md)

This time the Lord will come to the help of His people. [Zac
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003.md). "And Jehovah will go forth and
fight against those nations, as in His day of battle, on the day of
slaughter. [Zac 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004.md). And His feet
will stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which lies to the east
before Jerusalem; and the Mount of Olives will split in the centre from
east to west into a very great valley, and half of the mountain will
remove to the north, and its (other) half to the south. [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md). And ye will flee into the valley
of my mountains, and the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel, and
ye will flee as ye fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king
of Judah. And Jehovah my God will come, all the saints with Thee."
Against those nations which have conquered Jerusalem the Lord will fight
כּיום וגו, as the day, i.e., as on the day, of His fighting, to which
there is added, for the purpose of strengthening the expression, "on the
day of the slaughter." The meaning is not "according to the day when He
fought in the day of the war," as Jerome and many others suppose, who
refer the words to the conflict between Jehovah and the Egyptians at the
Red Sea ([Exo 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#014).md); for there is
nothing to support this special allusion. According to the historical
accounts in the Old Testament, Jehovah went out more than once to fight
for His people (cf. [Jos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014.md), [Jos
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#042.md); [Jos
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#003.md); [Jdg
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015.md); [Sa1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010.md); [Ch2
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#015).md). The simile is therefore to be
taken in a more general sense, as signifying "as He is accustomed to
fight in the day of battle and slaughter," and to be understood as
referring to all the wars of the Lord on behalf of His people. In [Zac
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004.md) and [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md) we have first of all a
description of what the Lord will do to save the remnant of His people.
He appears upon the Mount of Olives, and as His feet touch the mountain
it splits in half, so that a large valley is formed. The splitting of
the mountain is the effect of the earthquake under the footsteps of
Jehovah, before whom the earth trembles when He touches it (cf. [Exo
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018.md); [Jdg
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#005.md); [Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008.md); [Nah
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005), etc..md). The more precise
definition of the situation of the Mount of Olives, viz., "before
Jerusalem eastwards," is not introduced with a geographical purpose -
namely, to distinguish it from other mountains upon which olives trees
grow - but is connected with the means employed by the Lord for the
salvation of His people, for whom He opens a way of escape by splitting
the mountain in two. The mountain is splitמחציו מזרחה וימּה, from the
half (i.e., the midst) of it to the east and to the west, i.e., so that
a chasm ensues, which runs from the centre of the mountain both
eastwards and westwards; so that the mountain is split latitudinally,
one half (as is added to make it still more clear) removing to the
south, the other to the north, and a great valley opening between them.

Into this valley the half of the nation that is still in Jerusalem will
flee. גּיא הרי is the accusative of direction (Luther and others render
it incorrectly, "before the valley of my mountains"). This valley is not
the valley of the Tyropaeon, or the valley between Moriah and Zion
(Jerome, Drus., Hofm.), but the valley which has been formed by the
splitting of the Mount of Olives; and Jehovah calls the two mountains
which have been formed through His power out of the Mount of Olives
hârai, "my mountains." Nor is it connected with the valley of
Jehoshaphat; for the opinion that the newly-formed valley is merely an
extension of the valley of Jehoshaphat has no foundation in the text,
and is not in harmony with the direction taken by the new valley -
namely, from east to west. The explanatory clause which follows, "for
the (newly-formed) valley of the mountains will reach אל אצל," shows
that the flight of the people into the valley is not to be understood as
signifying that the valley will merely furnish the fugitives with a
level road for escape, but that they will find a secure place of shelter
in the valley. 'El 'Atsal has been taken by different commentators,
after Symm. and Jerome, in an appellative sense, "to very near," which
Koehler interprets as signifying that the valley will reach to the place
where the fugitives are. This would be to Jerusalem, for that was where
the fugitives were then. But if Zechariah had meant to say this, he
could not have spoken more obscurely. 'Atsal, the form in pause for
'âtsēl, as we may see by comparing [Ch1
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#038.md) and [Ch1
9:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#044.md) with [Ch1
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#039.md) and [Ch1
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#043) (cf. Olsh. Gramm. 91, d.md), is only
met with elsewhere in the form אצל, not merely as a preposition, but
also in the name בּית־האצל, and is here a proper name, as most of the
ancient translators perceived, - namely, a contracted form of בּית־האצל,
since בּית is frequently omitted from names of places constructed with
it (see Ges. Thes. p. 193). This place is to be sought for, according to
[Mic 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#011.md), in the neighbourhood of
Jerusalem, and according to the passage before us to the east of the
Mount of Olives, as Cyril states, though from mere hearsay, κώμη δὲ αὕτη
πρὸς ἐσχατιαῖς, ὡς λόγος τοῦ ὄρους κειμένη. The fact that Jerome does
not mention the place is no proof that it did not exist. A small place
not far from Jerusalem, on the other side of the Mount of Olives, might
have vanished from the earth long before this father lived. The
comparison of the flight to the flight from the earthquake in the time
of king Uzziah, to which reference is made in [Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md), is intended to express not merely
the swiftness and universality of the flight, but also the cause of the
flight, - namely, that they do not merely fly from the enemy, but also
for fear of the earthquake which will attend the coming of the Lord. In
the last clause of [Zac 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md) the
object of the coming of the Lord is indicated. He has not only gone
forth to fight against the enemy in Jerusalem, and deliver His people;
but He comes with His holy angels, to perfect His kingdom by means of
the judgment, and to glorify Jerusalem. This coming is not materially
different from His going out to war ([Zac
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003).md); it is not another or a second
coming, but simply a visible manifestation. For this coming believers
wait, because it brings them redemption ([Luk
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028).md). This joyful waiting is
expressed in the address "my God." The holy ones are the angels (cf.
[Deu 33:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md); [Dan
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md); [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031).md), not believers, or believers as
well as the angels. In what follows, Zechariah depicts first of all the
completion secured by the coming of the Lord ([Zac
14:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006).md), and then the judgment upon
the enemy ([Zac 14:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012).md), with its
fruits and consequences ([Zac
14:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016).md).

[Zechariah 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 14:6</span></span>

Complete salvation. - [Zac 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006.md). "And
it will come to pass on that day, there will not be light, the glorious
ones will melt away. [Zac 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#007.md). And it
will be an only day, which will be known to Jehovah, not day nor night:
and it will come to pass, at evening time it will be light." The coming
of the Lord will produce a change on the earth. The light of the earth
will disappear. The way in which לא יהיה אור is to be understood is
indicated more precisely by יקרות יקפאון. These words have been
interpreted, however, from time immemorial in very different ways. The
difference of gender in the combination of the feminine יקרות with the
masculine verb יקפּאוּן, and the rarity with which the two words are met
with, have both contributed to produce the keri יקרות וקפּאון, in which
יקרות has either been taken as a substantive formation from קרר, or the
reading וקרות with Vav cop. has been adopted in the sense of cold, and
קפּאון (contraction, rigidity) taken to signify ice. The whole clause
has then been either regarded as an antithesis to the preceding one, "It
will not be light, but (sc., there will be) cold and ice" (thus Targ.,
Pesh., Symm., Itala, Luther, and many others); or taken in this sense,
"There will not be light, and cold, and ice, i.e., no alternation of
light, cold, and ice will occur" (Ewald, Umbr., Bunsen). But there is
intolerable harshness in both these views: in the first, on account of
the insertion of יהיה without a negation for the purpose of obtaining an
antithesis; in the second, because the combination of light, cold, and
ice is illogical and unparalleled in the Scriptures, and cannot be
justified even by an appeal to [Gen
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022.md), since light is no more
equivalent to day and night than cold and ice are to frost and heat, or
summer and winter. We must therefore follow Hengstenberg, Hofmann,
Koehler, and Kliefoth, who prefer the chethib יקפאון, and read it
יקפּאוּן, the imperf. kal of קפא. קפא signifies to congeal, or curdle,
and is applied in [Exo 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#008.md) to the
heaping up of the waters as it were in solid masses. יקרות, the costly
or splendid things are the stars, according to [Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md), where the moon is spoken of as
יקר הולך, walking in splendour. The words therefore describe the passing
away or vanishing of the brightness of the shining stars, answering to
the prophetic announcement, that on the day of judgment, sun, moon, and
stars will lose their brightness or be turned into darkness ([Joe
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015.md); [Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010.md); [Eze
32:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md), [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md); [Rev
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012).md). In [Zac
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#007.md) this day is still more clearly
described: first, as solitary in its kind; and secondly, as a marvellous
day, on which the light dawns at evening time. The four clauses of this
verse contain only two thoughts; each so expressed in two clauses that
the second explains the first. יום אחד, unus dies, is not equivalent to
tempus non longum (Cocceius, Hengst.), nor to "only one day, not two or
more" (Koehler), but solitary in its kind, unparalleled by any other,
because no second of the kind ever occurs (for the use of 'echâd in this
sense, compare [Zac 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009.md), [Eze
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#005.md), [Sol
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009).md). It is necessary to take the
words in this manner on account of the following clause, "it will be
known to the Lord;" i.e., not "it will be singled out by Jehovah in the
series of days as the appropriate one" (Hitzig and Koehler), nor "it
stands under the supervision and guidance of the Lord, so that it does
not come unexpectedly, or interfere with His plans" (Hengstenberg), for
neither of these is expressed in נודע; but simply, it is known to the
Lord according to its true nature, and therefore is distinguished above
all other days. The following definition, "not day and not night," does
not mean that "it will form a turbid mixture of day and night, in which
there will prevail a mongrel condition of mysterious, horrifying
twilight and gloom" (Koehler); but it will resemble neither day nor
night, because the lights of heaven, which regulate day and night, lose
their brightness, and at evening time there comes not darkness, but
light. The order of nature is reversed: the day resembles the night, and
the evening brings light. At the time when, according to the natural
course of events, the dark night should set in, a bright light will
dawn. The words do not actually affirm that the alternation of day and
night will cease (Jerome, Neumann, Kliefoth); but this may be inferred
from a comparison of [Rev 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023.md) and
[Rev 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#025.md).

[Zechariah 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 14:8</span></span>

[Zac 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md). "And it will come to pass
in that day, that living waters will go out from Jerusalem; by half into
the eastern sea, and by half into the western sea: in summer and in
winter will it be. [Zac 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009.md). And
Jehovah will be King over all the land; in that day will Jehovah be one,
and His name one. [Zac 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md). The
whole land will turn as the plain from Geba to Rimmon, south of
Jerusalem; and this will be high, and dwell in its place, from the gate
of Benjamin to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from
the tower of Chananeel to the king's wine-presses. [Zac
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#011.md). And men will dwell therein, and
there will be no more curse (ban); and Jerusalem will dwell securely."
The living water which issues from Jerusalem, and pours over the land on
both sides, flowing both into the eastern or Dead Sea, and into the
hinder (i.e., western) or Mediterranean Sea (see at [Joe
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020).md), is, according to [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018.md) and [Eze
47:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md), a figurative representation
of the salvation and blessing which will flow out of Jerusalem, the
centre of the kingdom of God, over the holy land, and produce vigorous
life on every hand. According to Joel and Ezekiel, the water issues from
the temple (see at [Joe 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018).md).
Zechariah adds, that this will take place in summer and winter, i.e.,
will proceed without interruption throughout the whole year, whereas
natural streams dry up in summer time in Palestine. To this blessing
there is added the higher spiritual blessing, that Jehovah will be King
over all the land, and His name alone will be mentioned and revered.
כּל־הארץ does not mean the whole earth, but, as in [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md) and [Zac
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md), the whole of the land of Canaan
or of Israel, which is bounded by the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean. It
by no means follows from this, however, that Zechariah is simply
speaking of a glorification of Palestine. For Canaan, or the land of
Israel, is a type of the kingdom of God in the full extent which it will
have on the earth in the last days depicted here. Jehovah's kingship
does not refer to the kingdom of nature, but to the kingdom of grace, -
namely, to the perfect realization of the sovereignty of God, for which
the old covenant prepared the way; whereas the old Israel continually
rebelled against Jehovah's being King, both by its sin and its idolatry.
This rebellion, i.e., the apostasy of the nation from its God, is to
cease, and the Lord alone will be King and God of the redeemed nation,
and be acknowledged by it; His name alone will be mentioned, and not the
names of idols as well.

The earthly soil of the kingdom of God will then experience a change.
The whole land will be levelled into a plain, and Jerusalem will be
elevated in consequence; and Jerusalem, when thus exalted, will be
restored in its fullest extent. יסּב (imperf. kal, not niphal; see Ges.
67, 5), to change like the plain, i.e., to change so as to become like
the plain. הערבה is not a plain generally, in which case the article
would be used generically, but the plain, so called κατ ̓ ἐξοχήν, the
plain of the Jordan, or the Ghor (see at [Deu
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001).md). The definition "from Geba to
Rimmon" does not belong to כּערבה (Umbreit, Neum., Klief.), but to
כּל־הארץ; for there was no plain between Geba and Rimmon, but only an
elevated, hilly country. Geba is the present Jeba, about three hours to
the north of Jerusalem (see at [Jos
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024).md), and was the northern frontier
city of the kingdom of Judah ([Kg2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008).md). Rimmon, which is distinguished
by the clause "to the south of Jerusalem" from the Rimmon in Galilee,
the present Rummaneh to the north of Nazareth (see at [Jos
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013).md), and from the rock of Rimmon,
the present village of Rummon, about fifteen Roman miles to the north of
Jerusalem (see [Jdg 20:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#045).md), is the
Rimmon situated on the border of Edom, which was given up by the tribe
of Judah to the Simeonites ([Jos
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md); [Jos
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007).md), probably on the site of the
present ruins of Um er Rummanim, four hours to the north of Beersheba
(see at [Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032).md). To וראמה וגו we
must supply as the subject Jerusalem, which has been mentioned just
before. ראמה is probably only an outwardly expanded form of רמה from
רוּם, like קאם in [Hos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md). The
whole land will be lowered, that Jerusalem alone may be high. This is,
of course, not to be understood as signifying a physical elevation
caused by the depression of the rest of the land; but the description is
a figurative one, like the exaltation of the temple mountain above all
the mountains in [Mic 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md). Jerusalem,
as the residence of the God-King, is the centre of the kingdom of God;
and in the future this is to tower high above all the earth. The
figurative description is attached to the natural situation of
Jerusalem, which stood upon a broad mountain ridge, and was surrounded
by mountains, which were loftier than the city (see Robinson,
Palestine). The exaltation is a figurative representation of the
spiritual elevation and glory which it is to receive. Moreover,
Jerusalem is to dwell on its ancient site (ישׁב תּחתּיה, as in [Zac
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006).md). The meaning of this is not that
the exaltation above the surrounding land will be the only alteration
that will take place in its situation (Koehler); but, as a comparison
with [Jer 31:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038.md) clearly shows, that
the city will be restored or rebuilt in its former extent, and therefore
is to be completely recovered from the ruin brought upon it by conquest
and plunder ([Zac 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001).md). The
boundaries of the city that are mentioned here cannot be determined with
perfect certainty. The first definitions relate to the extent of the
city from east to west. The starting-point (for the use of למן, see [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018).md) is Benjamin's gate, in the north
wall, through which the road to Benjamin and thence to Ephraim ran, so
that it was no doubt the same as Ephraim's gate mentioned in [Kg2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md) and [Neh
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#016.md). The terminus ad quem, on the
other hand, is doubtful, viz., "to the place of the first gate, to the
corner gate." According to the grammatical construction, עד־שׁער הפּנּים
is apparently in apposition to עד־מקום שׁער הר, or a more precise
description of the position of the first gate; and Hitzig and Kliefoth
have taken the words in this sense. Only we cannot see any reason why
the statement "to the place of the first gate" should be introduced at
all, if the other statement "to the corner gate" describes the very same
terminal point, and that in a clearer manner. We must therefore assume,
as the majority of commentators have done, that the two definitions
refer to two different terminal points; in other words, that they define
the extent both eastwards and westwards from the Benjamin's gate, which
stood near the centre of the north wall. The corner gate (sha‛ar
happinnı̄m is no doubt the same as sha‛ar happinnâh in [Kg2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md) and [Jer
31:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038).md) was at the western corner of
the north wall. "The first gate" is supposed to be identical with שׁער
היּשׁנה, the gate of the old (city), in [Neh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#006.md) and [Neh
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#039.md), and its place at the
north-eastern corner of the city. The definitions which follow give the
extent of the city from north to south. We must supply מן before מגדּל.
The tower of Hananeel ([Jer 31:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038.md);
[Neh 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md); [Neh
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#039).md) stood at the north-east corner
of the city (see at [Neh 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001).md). The
king's wine-presses were unquestionably in the king's gardens at the
south side of the city ([Neh 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015).md). In
the city so glorified the inhabitants dwell (ישׁבוּ in contrast to going
out as captives or as fugitives, [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md), [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005).md), and that as a holy nation, for
there will be no more any ban in the city. The ban presupposes sin, and
is followed by extermination as a judgment (cf. [Jos
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#018).md). The city and its inhabitants
will therefore be no more exposed to destruction, but will dwell safely,
and have no more hostile attacks to fear (cf. [Isa
65:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#018.md). and [Rev
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003).md).

Punishment of the hostile nations. - [Zac
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012.md). "And this will be the stroke
wherewith Jehovah will smite all the nations which have made war upon
Jerusalem: its flesh will rot while it stands upon its feet, and its
eyes will rot in their sockets, and its tongue will rot in their mouth.
[Zac 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#013.md). And it will come to pass
in that day, the confusion from Jehovah will be great among them, and
they will lay hold of one another's hand, and his hand will rise up
against the hand of his neighbour. [Zac
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#014.md). And Judah will also fight at
Jerusalem, and the riches of all nations will be gathered together round
about, gold and silver and clothes in great abundance. [Zac
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#015.md). And so will be the stroke of
the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the
cattle, that shall be in the same tents, like this stroke." To the
description of the salvation there is appended here as the obverse side
the execution of the punishment upon the foe, which was only indicated
in [Zac 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003.md). The nations which made
war against Jerusalem shall be destroyed partly by the rotting away of
their bodies even while they are alive ([Zac
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012).md), partly by mutual
destruction([Zac 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#013).md), and partly by
Judah's fighting against them ([Zac
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#014).md). To express the idea of their
utter destruction, all the different kinds of plagues and strokes by
which nations can be destroyed are grouped together. In the first rank
we have two extraordinary strokes inflicted upon them by God. Maggēphâh
always denotes a plague or punishment sent by God ([Exo
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#014.md); [Num
14:37](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#037.md); [Sa1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#004).md). המק, the inf. abs. hiphil in the
place of the finite verb: "He (Jehovah) makes its flesh rot while it
stands upon its feet," i.e., He causes putrefaction to take place even
while the body is alive. The singular suffixes are to be taken
distributively: the flesh of every nation or every foe. To strengthen
the threat there is added the rotting of the eyes which spied out the
nakednesses of the city of God, and of the tongue which blasphemed God
and His people (cf. [Isa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#006).md). The
other kind of destruction is effected by a panic terror, through which
the foes are thrown into confusion, so that they turn their weapons
against one another and destroy one another, - an occurrence of which
several examples are furnished by the Israelitish history (compare [Jdg
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022.md); [Sa1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#020.md), and especially that in [Ch2
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023.md), in the reign of Jehoshaphat, to
which the description given by our prophet refers). The grasp of the
other's hand is a hostile one in this case, the object being to seize
him, and, having lifted his hand, to strike him dead. [Zac
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#014.md) is translated by Luther and many
others, after the Targum and Vulgate, "Judah will fight against
Jerusalem," on the ground that נלחם ב generally signifies "to fight
against a person." But this by no means suits the context here, since
those who fight against Jerusalem are "all the heathen" ([Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md), and nothing is said about any
opposition between Jerusalem and Judah. ב is used here in a local sense,
as in [Exo 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md), with נלחם, and the
thought is this: Not only will Jehovah smite the enemies miraculously
with plagues and confusion, but Judah will also take part in the
conflict against them, and fight against them in Jerusalem, which they
have taken. Judah denotes the whole of the covenant nation, and not
merely the inhabitants of the country in distinction from the
inhabitants of the capital. Thus will Judah seize as booty the costly
possessions of the heathen, and thereby visit the heathen with ample
retribution for the plundering of Jerusalem ([Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md). And the destruction of the
enemy will be so complete, that even their beasts of burden, and those
used in warfare, and all their cattle, will be destroyed by the same
plague as the men; just as in the case of the ban, not only the men, but
also their cattle, were put to death (cf. [Jos
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#024).md). Moreover, there is hardly any
need for the express remark, that this description is only a
rhetorically individualizing amplification of the thought that the
enemies of the kingdom of God are to be utterly destroyed - namely,
those who do not give up their hostility and turn unto God. For the
verses which follow show very clearly that it is only to these that the
threat of punishment refers.

Conversion of the heathen. - [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md). "And it will come to pass, that
every remnant of all the nations which came against Jerusalem will go up
year by year to worship the King Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the feast
of tabernacles. [Zac 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017.md). And it
will come to pass, that whoever of the families of the earth does not go
up to Jerusalem to worship the King Jehovah of hosts, upon them there
will be no rain. [Zac 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#018.md). And if
the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, then also not upon them;
there will be (upon them) the plague with which Jehovah will plague all
nations which do not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles. [Zac
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#019.md). This will be the sin of Egypt,
and the sin of all the nations, which do not go up to keep the feast of
tabernacles." The heathen will not be all destroyed by the judgment; but
a portion of them will be converted. This portion is called "the whole
remnant of those who marched against Jerusalem" (בּוא על as in [Zac
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009).md). It will turn to the worship of
the Lord. The construction in [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md) is anacolouthic: כּל־הנּותר,
with its further definition, is placed at the head absolutely, whilst
the predicate is attached in the form of an apodosis with ועלוּ. The
entrance of the heathen into the kingdom of God is depicted under the
figure of the festal journeys to the sanctuary of Jehovah, which had to
be repeated year by year. Of the feasts which they will keep there every
year (on מדּי, see Delitzsch on [Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023).md), the feast of tabernacles is
mentioned, not because it occurred in the autumn, and the autumn was the
best time for travelling (Theod. Mops., Theodoret, Grot., Ros.), or
because it was the greatest feast of rejoicing kept by the Jews, or for
any other outward reason, but simply on account of its internal
significance, which we must not seek for, however, as Koehler does, in
its agrarian importance as a feast of thanksgiving for the termination
of the harvest, and of the gathering in of the fruit; but rather in its
historical allusion as a feast of thanksgiving for the gracious
protection of Israel in its wanderings through the desert, and its
introduction into the promised land with its abundance of glorious
blessings, whereby it foreshadowed the blessedness to be enjoyed in the
kingdom of God (see my bibl. Archologie, i. p. 414ff.). This feast will
be kept by the heathen who have come to believe in the living God, to
thank the Lord for His grace, that He has brought them out of the
wanderings of this life into the blessedness of His kingdom of peace.
With this view of the significance of the feast of tabernacles, it is
also possible to harmonize the punishment threatened in [Zac
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017.md) for neglecting to keep this
feast, - namely, that the rain will not be (come) upon the families of
the nations which absent themselves from this feast. For rain is an
individualizing expression denoting the blessing of God generally, and
is mentioned here with reference to the fact, that without rain the
fruits of the land, on the enjoyment of which our happiness depends,
will not flourish. The meaning of the threat is, therefore, that those
families which do not come to worship the Lord, will be punished by Him
with the withdrawal of the blessings of His grace. The Egyptians are
mentioned again, by way of example, as those upon whom the punishment
will fall. So far as the construction of this verse is concerned, ולע
באה is added to strengthen תעלה and לא עליהם contains the apodosis to
the conditional clause introduced with אם, to which יהיה הגּשׁם is
easily supplied from [Zac 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017.md). The
positive clause which follows is then appended as an asyndeton: It (the
fact that the rain does not come) will be the plague, etc. The prophet
mentions Egypt especially, not because of the fact in natural history,
that this land owes its fertility not to the rain, but to the
overflowing of the Nile, - a notion which has given rise to the most
forced interpretations; but as the nation which showed the greatest
hostility to Jehovah and His people in the olden time, and for the
purpose of showing that this nation was also to attain to a full
participation in the blessings of salvation bestowed upon Israel (cf.
[Isa 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#019)..md). In [Zac
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#019.md) this thought is rounded off by
way of conclusion. זאת, this, namely the fact that no rain falls, will
be the sin of Egypt, etc. חטּאת, the sin, including its consequences, or
in its effects, as in [Num 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#023.md), etc.
Moreover, we must not infer from the way in which this is carried out in
[Zac 14:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017.md), that at the time of the
completion of the kingdom of God there will still be heathen, who will
abstain from the worship of the true God; but the thought is simply
this: there will then be no more room for heathenism within the sphere
of the kingdom of God. To this there is appended the thought, in [Zac
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md), [Zac
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021.md), that everything unholy will
then be removed from that kingdom.

[Zechariah 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">zac 14:20</span></span>

[Zac 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md). "In that day there will
stand upon the bells of the horses, Holy to Jehovah; and the pots in the
house of Jehovah will be like the sacrificial bowls before the altar.
[Zac 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021.md). And every pot in Jerusalem
and Judah will be holy to Jehovah of hosts, and all who sacrifice will
come and take of them, and boil therein; and there will be no Canaanite
any more in the house of Jehovah of hosts in that day." The meaning of
[Zac 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md) is not exhausted by the
explanation given by Michaelis, Ewald, and others, that even the horses
will then be consecrated to the Lord. The words קדשׁ ליהוה were engraven
upon the gold plate on the tiara of the high priest, in the characters
used in engravings upon a seal ([Exo
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036).md). If, then, these words are
(i.e., are to stand) upon the bells of the horses, the meaning is, that
the bells of the horses will resemble the head-dress of the high priest
in holiness.

(Note: It follows from this passage, that it was an Israelitish custom
to hang bells upon the horses and mules as ornaments, and probably also
for other purposes, as with us. This custom was a very common one in
antiquity (see the proofs which have been so diligently collected in
Dougtaei Analecta sacr. p. 296ff.).)

This does not merely express the fact that the whole of the ceremonial
law will be abolished, but also that the distinction between holy and
profane will cease, inasmuch as even the most outward things, and things
having no connection whatever with worship, will be as holy as those
objects formerly were, which were dedicated to the service of Jehovah by
a special consecration. In [Zac 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md)
and [Zac 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021.md), the graduated
distinction between the things which were more or less holy is brought
prominently out. The pots in the sanctuary, which were used for boiling
the sacrificial flesh, were regarded as much less holy than the
sacrificial bowls in which the blood of the sacrificial animals was
received, and out of which it was sprinkled or poured upon the altar. In
the future these pots will be just as holy as the sacrificial bowls; and
indeed not merely the boiling pots in the temple, but all the boiling
pots in Jerusalem and Judah, which have hitherto been only clean and not
holy, so that men will use them at pleasure for boiling the sacrificial
flesh. In this priestly-levitical drapery the thought is expressed, that
in the perfected kingdom of God not only will everything without
exception be holy, but all will be equally holy. The distinction between
holy and profane can only cease, however, when the sin and moral
defilement which first evoked this distinction, and made it necessary
that the things intended for the service of God should be set apart, and
receive a special consecration, have been entirely removed and wiped
away. To remove this distinction, to prepare the way for the cleansing
away of sin, and to sanctify once more that which sin had desecrated,
was the object of the sacred institutions appointed by God. To this end
Israel was separated from the nations of the earth; and in order to
train it up as a holy nation, and to secure the object described, a law
was given to it, in which the distinction between holy and profane ran
through all the relations of life. And this goal will be eventually
reached by the people of God; and sin with all its consequences be
cleansed away by the judgment. In the perfected kingdom of God there
will be no more sinners, but only such as are righteous and holy. This
is affirmed in the last clause: there will be no Canaanite any more in
the house of Jehovah. The Canaanites are mentioned here, not as
merchants, as in [Zep 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#011.md); [Hos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008.md) (as Jonathan, Aquila, and others
suppose), but as a people laden with sin, and under the curse ([Gen
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025.md); [Lev
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024.md).; [Deu
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002.md); [Deu
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#004), etc..md), which has been
exterminated by the judgment. In this sense, as the expression לא עוד
implies, the term Canaanite is used to denote the godless members of the
covenant nation, who came to the temple with sacrifices, in outward
self-righteousness. As עוד presupposes that there were Canaanites in the
temple of Jehovah in the time of the prophet, the reference cannot be to
actual Canaanites, because they were prohibited by the law from entering
the temple, but only to Israelites, who were Canaanites in heart.
Compare [Isa 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010.md), where the princes
of Judah are called princes of Sodom ([Eze
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003.md); [Eze
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#009).md). The "house of Jehovah" is the
temple, as in the preceding verse, and not the church of Jehovah, as in
[Zac 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008.md), although at the time of the
completion of the kingdom of God the distinction between Jerusalem and
the temple will have ceased, and the whole of the holy city, yea, the
whole of the kingdom of God, will be transformed by the Lord into a holy
of holies (see [Rev 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022.md), [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027).md).

Thus does our prophecy close with a prospect of the completion of the
kingdom of God in glory. All believing commentators are agreed that the
final fulfilment of [Zac 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md) and
[Zac 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021.md) lies before us in [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md) and [Rev
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md), and that even [Zac
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md) neither refers to the
Chaldaean catastrophe nor to the Maccabaean wars, but to the Messianic
times, however they may differ from one another in relation to the
historical events which the prophecy foretels. Hofmann and Koehler, as
well as Ebrard and Kliefoth, start with the assumption, that the
prophecy in ch. 12-14 strikes in where the preceding one in ch. 9-11
terminates; that is to say, that it commences with the time when Israel
was given up to the power of the fourth empire, on account of its
rejection of the good shepherd, who appeared in Christ. Now since
Hofmann and Koehler understand by Israel only the chosen people of the
old covenant, or the Jewish nation, and by Jerusalem the capital of this
nation in Palestine, they find this prophecy in [Zac
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md), that when Jehovah shall
eventually bring to pass the punishment of the bad shepherd, i.e., of
the imperial power, with its hostility to God, it will assemble together
again in its members the nations of the earth, to make war upon the
material Jerusalem and Israel, which has returned again from its
dispersion in all the world into the possession of the holy land
(Palestine), and will besiege the holy city; but it will there be
smitten by Jehovah, and lose its power over Israel. At that time will
Jehovah also bring the previous hardening of Israel to an end, open its
eyes to its sin against the Saviour it has put to death, and effect its
conversion. But they differ in opinion as to ch. 14. According to
Koehler, this chapter refers to a future which is still in the distance
- to a siege and conquest of Jerusalem which are to take place after
Israel's conversion, through which the immediate personal appearance of
Jehovah will be brought to pass, and all the effects by which that
appearance is necessarily accompanied. According to Hofmann
(Schriftbeweis, ii. p. 610ff.), [Zac
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md). refers to the same occurrence as
[Zac 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md)., with this simple
difference, that in [Zac 12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md) the
prophet states what that day, in which the whole of the world of nations
attacks Jerusalem, will do with the people of God, and in ch. 14 to what
extremity it will be brought. Ebrard and Kliefoth, on the other hand,
understand by Israel, with its capital Jerusalem, and the house of David
(in Zechariah 12:1-13:6), rebellious Judaism after the rejection of the
Messiah; and by Judah with its princes, Christendom. Hence the prophecy
in this section announces what calamities will happen to Israel
according to the flesh - that has become rebellious through rejecting
the Messiah - from the first coming of Christ onwards, until its
ultimate conversion after the fulness of the Gentiles has come in.

(Note: Kliefoth accordingly finds the siege of Jerusalem, predicted in
[Zac 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md), fulfilled in the siege of
that city by Titus. The besieging nations then drank the reeling-cup;
for the subjection of Judah was the last act in the victory of the Roman
empire over the Macedonian. Rome was then at the summit of its imperial
greatness; and from that time forth it became reeling and weak. This
weakening was indeed prepared and effected through the Christina church;
but it was just the siege of Jerusalem which transferred the centre of
the Christian church from Jerusalem to the Roman empire. The fulfilment
of [Zac 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003.md) is to be found in the
Crusades, the Oriental question, the Haute Finance, and the Emancipation
of the Jews. Jerusalem has thus become a burden-stone for all nations,
etc.)

The section [Zac 13:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md) (the smiting
of the shepherd) does not refer to the crucifixion of Christ, because
this did not lead to the consequences indicated in [Zac
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008.md), so far as the whole earth was
concerned, but to the "cutting off of the Messiah" predicted in [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), the great apostasy which forms
the beginning of the end, according to [Luk
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#025.md); [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md); [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md), and [Ti1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002.md) Time. [Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md), and through which Christ in His
church is, according to the description in [Rev
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#017.md), so cut off from historical
life, that it cannot be anything on earth. Lastly, ch. 14 treats of the
end of the world and the general judgment.

Of these two views, we cannot look upon either as well founded. For, in
the first place, the assumption common to the two, and with which they
set out, is erroneous and untenable, - namely, that the prophecy in ch.
12ff. strikes in where the previous one in ch. 9-11 terminated, and
therefore that ch. 12-14 is a direct continuation of ch. 9-11. This
assumption is at variance not only with the relation in which the two
prophecies stand to one another, as indicated by the correspondence in
their headings, and as unfolded in [Zac
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md), [Zac
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md), but also with the essence of the
prophecy, inasmuch as it is not a historical prediction of the future
according to its successive development, but simply a spiritual
intuition effected by inspiration, in which only the leading features of
the form which the kingdom of God would hereafter assume are set forth,
and that in figures drawn from the circumstances of the present and the
past. Again, the two views can only be carried out by forcing the text.
If the prophecy in [Zac 12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md)
started with the period when Israel came into power of the Roman empire
after the rejection of the Messiah, it could not leap so abruptly to the
last days, as Hofmann and Koehler assume, and commence with the
description of a victorious conflict on the part of Israel against the
nations of the world that were besieging Jerusalem, but would certainly
first of all predict, if not the destruction of the Jewish nation by the
Romans (which is merely indicated in ch. 11), at all events the
gathering together of the Jews, who had been scattered by the Romans
over all the world, into Palestine and Jerusalem, before an attack of
the nations of the world upon Israel could possibly be spoken of.
Moreover, even the difference between Hofmann and Koehler with regard to
the relation between [Zac 12:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md) and
[Zac 14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md) shows that the
transference of the whole to the last times cannot be reconciled with
the words of these sections. The hypothesis of Koehler, that after the
gathering together of Israel out of its dispersion, the nations of the
world would make an attack upon Jerusalem in which they would be
defeated, and that this conflict would for the first time bring Israel
to the recognition of its guilt in putting Christ to death, is at
variance with the whole of the prophecy and teaching of both the Old and
New Testaments. For, according to these, Israel is not to be gathered
together from its dispersion among the nations till it shall return with
penitence to Jehovah, whom it has rejected. But Hofmann's statement as
to the relation between the two sections is so brief and obscure, that
it is more like a concealment than a clearing up of the difficulties
which it contains. Lastly, when Hofmann correctly observes, that "by the
Israel of the heading in [Zac 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md) we
can only understand the people of God, in contradistinction to the world
of nations, which is estranged from God," this cannot apply to the
unbelieving Jews, who have been given into the power of the last empire
on account of their rejection of Christ, or Israel according to the
flesh, for that Israel is rejected by God. The people of God exists,
since the rejection of Christ, only in Christendom, which has been
formed out of believing Jews and believing Gentiles, or the church of
the New Testament, the stem and kernel of which were that portion of
Israel which believingly accepted the Messiah when He appeared, and into
whose bosom the believing Gentile peoples were received. Ebrard and
Kliefoth are therefore perfectly right in their rejection of the Jewish
chiliasm of Hofmann and Koehler; but when they understand by the Israel
of the heading belonging to ch. 12-14, which we find in [Zac
12:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md), only the unbelieving carnal
Israel, and by that in ch. 14 the believing Israel which has been
converted to Christ, and also introduce into [Zac
12:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md) an antithesis between Israel
and Judah, and then understand by Jerusalem and the house of David in
[Zac 12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md) the hardened Jews, and by
Judah, Christendom; and, on the other hand, by Jerusalem and Judah in
ch. 14 the Christendom formed of believing Jews and believing Gentiles,
- we have already shown at [Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md)
that these distinctions are arbitrarily forced upon the text.

Our prophecy treats in both parts - Zechariah 12:1-13:6 and ch.
13:7-14:21 - of Israel, the people of God, and indeed the people of the
new covenant, which has grown out of the Israel that believed in Christ,
and believers of the heathen nations incorporated into it, and refers
not merely to the church of the new covenant in the last times, when all
the old Israel will be liberated by the grace of God from the hardening
inflicted upon it, and will be received again into the kingdom of God,
and form a central point thereof (Vitringa, C. B. Mich., etc.), but to
the whole development of the church of Christ from its first beginning
till its completion at the second coming of the Lord, as Hengstenberg
has in the main discovered and observed. As the Israel of the heading
([Zac 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001).md) denotes the people of God
in contradistinction to the peoples of the world, the inhabitants of
Jerusalem with the house of David, and Judah with its princes, as the
representatives of Israel, are typical epithets applied to the
representatives and members of the new covenant people, viz., the
Christian church; and Jerusalem and Judah, as the inheritance of Israel,
are types of the seats and territories of Christendom. The development
of the new covenant nation, however, in conflict with the heathen world,
and through the help of the Lord and His Spirit, until its glorious
completion, is predicted in our oracle, not according to its successive
historical course, but in such a manner that the first half announces
how the church of the Lord victoriously defeats the attacks of the
heathen world through the miraculous help of the Lord, and how in
consequence of this victory it is increased by the fact that the
hardened Israel comes more and more to the acknowledgment of its sin and
to belief in the Messiah, whom it has put to death, and is incorporated
into the church; whilst the second half, on the other hand, announces
how, in consequence of the slaying of the Messiah, there falls upon the
covenant nation a judgment through which two-thirds are exterminated,
and the remainder is tested and refined by the Lord, so that, although
many do indeed fall and perish in the conflicts with the nations of the
world, the remnant is preserved, and in the last conflict will be
miraculously delivered through the coming of the Lord, who will come
with His saints to complete His kingdom in glory by the destruction of
the enemies of His kingdom, and by the transformation and renewal of the
earth. As the believing penitential look at the pierced One ([Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md) will not take place for the
first time at the ultimate conversion of Israel at the end of the days,
but began on the day of Golgotha, and continues through all the
centuries of the Christian church, so did the siege of Jerusalem by all
nations ([Zac 12:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001).md), i.e., the
attack of the heathen nations upon the church of God, commence even in
the days of the apostles (cf. [Act
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025)..md), and continues through the
whole history of the Christina church to the last great conflict which
will immediately precede the return of our Lord to judgment. And again,
just as the dispersion of the flock after the slaying of the shepherd
commenced at the arrest and death of Christ, and the bringing back of
the hand of the Lord upon the small ones at the resurrection of Christ,
so have they both been repeated in every age of the Christian church,
inasmuch as with every fresh and powerful exaltation of antichristian
heathenism above the church of Christ, those who are weak in faith flee
and are scattered; but as soon as the Lord shows Himself alive in His
church again, they let Him gather them together once more. And this will
continue, according to the word of the Lord in [Mat
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#010.md)., till the end of the days, when
Satan will go out to deceive the nations in the four quarters of the
earth, and to gather together Gog and Magog to battle against the camp
of the saints and the holy city; whereupon the Lord from heaven will
destroy the enemy, and perfect His kingdom in the heavenly Jerusalem
(Rev).

So far as the relation between [Zac
12:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md) and [Zac
14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md) is concerned, it is evident
from the text of both these passages that they do not treat of two
different attacks upon the church of God by the imperial power,
occurring at different times; but that, whilst [Zac
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md) depicts the constantly
repeated attack in the light of its successful overthrow, ch. 14
describes the hostile attack according to its partial success and final
issue in the destruction of the powers that are hostile to God. This
issue takes place, no doubt, only at the end of the course of this
world, with the return of Christ to the last judgment; but the fact that
Jerusalem is conquered and plundered, and the half of its population led
away into captivity, proves indisputably that the siege of Jerusalem
predicted in ch. 14 must not be restricted to the last attack of
Antichrist upon the church of the Lord, but that all the hostile attacks
of the heathen world upon the city of God are embraced in the one
picture of a siege of Jerusalem. In the attack made upon Jerusalem by
Gog and Magog, the city is not conquered and plundered, either according
to Ezekiel 38 and 39, or according to [Rev
20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007.md); but the enemy is destroyed by
the immediate interposition of the Lord, without having got possession
of the holy city. But to this ideal summary of the conflicts and
victories of the nations of the world there is appended directly the
picture of the final destruction of the ungodly power of the world, and
the glorification of the kingdom of God; so that in Zechariah 14 (from
vv. 6-21) there is predicted in Old Testament form the completion of the
kingdom of God, which the Apostle John saw and described in Revelation
in New Testament mode under the figure of the heavenly Jerusalem.
