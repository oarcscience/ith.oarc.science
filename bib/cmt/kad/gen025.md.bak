### [Genesis Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 25:1</span></span>

Abraham's Marriage to Keturah is generally supposed to have taken place
after Sarah's death, and his power to beget six sons at so advanced an
age is attributed to the fact, that the Almighty had endowed him with
new vital and reproductive energy for begetting the son of the promise.
But there is no firm ground for this assumption; as it is not stated
anywhere, that Abraham did not take Keturah as his wife till after
Sarah's death. It is merely an inference drawn from the fact, that it is
not mentioned till afterwards; and it is taken for granted that the
history is written in strictly chronological order. But this supposition
is precarious, and is not in harmony with the statement, that Abraham
sent away the sons of the concubines with gifts during his own lifetime;
for in the case supposed, the youngest of Keturah's sons would not have
been more than twenty-five or thirty years old at Abraham's death; and
in those days, when marriages were not generally contracted before the
fortieth year, this seems too young for them to have been sent away from
their father's house. This difficulty, however, is not decisive. Nor
does the fact that Keturah is called a concubine in [Gen
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#006.md), and [Ch1
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#032.md), necessarily show that she was
contemporary with Sarah, but may be explained on the ground that Abraham
did not place her on the same footing as Sarah, his sole wife, the
mother of the promised seed. Of the sons and grandsons of Keturah, who
are mentioned in [Ch1 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#032.md) as well as
here, a few of the names may still be found among the Arabian tribes,
but in most instances the attempt to trace them is very questionable.
This remark applies to the identification of Zimran with Ζαββάμ (Ptol.
vi. 7, 5), the royal city of the Κιναιδοκολπῖται to the west of Mecca,
on the Red Sea; of Jokshan with the Κασσανῖται, on the Red Sea (Ptol.
vi. 7, 6), or with the Himyaritish tribe of Jakish in Southern Arabia;
of Ishbak with the name Shobek, a place in the Edomitish country first
mentioned by Abulfeda; of Shuah with the tribe Syayhe to the east of
Aila, or with Szyhhan in Northern Edom (Burckhardt, Syr. 692, 693, and
945), although the epithet the Shuhite, applied to Bildad, points to a
place in Northern Idumaea. There is more plausibility in the comparison
of Medan and Midian with Μοδιάνα on the eastern coast of the Elanitic
Gulf, and Μαδιάνα, a tract to the north of this (Ptol. vi. 7, 2, 27;
called by Arabian geographers Madyan, a city five days' journey to the
south of Aila). The relationship of these two tribes will explain the
fact, that the Midianim, [Gen 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#028.md),
are called Medanim in [Gen 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036.md).

[Genesis 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 25:3</span></span>

Of the sons of Jokshan, Sheba was probably connected with the Sabaeans,
who are associated in [Job 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019.md) with
Tema, are mentioned in [Job 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#015.md) as
having stolen Job's oxen and asses, and, according to Strabo (xvi. 779),
were neighbours of the Nabataeans in the vicinity of Syria. Dedan was
probably the trading people mentioned in [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md) along with Tema and Bus ([Isa
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md); [Jer
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008).md), in the neighbourhood of Edom
([Eze 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#015).md), with whom the tribe of
Banu Dudan, in Hejas, has been compared. On their relation to the
Cushites of the same name, vid., [Gen
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007.md) and [Gen
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#028.md), - Of the sons of Dedan, the
Asshurim have been associated with the warlike tribe of the Asir to the
south of Hejas, the Letushim with the Banu Leits in Hejas, and the
Leummim with the tribe of the Banu Lm, which extended even to Babylon
and Mesopotamia. Of the descendants of Midian, Ephah is mentioned in
[Isa 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006.md), in connection with Midian,
as a people trading in gold and incense. Epher has been compared with
the Banu Gifar in Hejas; Hanoch, with the place called Hanakye, three
days' journey to the north of Medinah; Abidah and el-daah, with the
tribes of Abide and Vadaa in the neighbourhood of Asir. But all this is
very uncertain.

[Genesis 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 25:5</span></span>

Before his death, Abraham made a final disposition of his property.
Isaac, the only son of his marriage with Sarah, received all his
possessions. The sons of the concubines (Hagar and Keturah) were sent
away with presents from their father's house into the east country,
i.e., Arabia in the widest sense, to the east and south-east of
Palestine.

[Genesis 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 25:7</span></span>

Abraham died at the good old age of 175, and was "gathered to his
people." This expression, which is synonymous with "going to his
fathers" ([Gen 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#015).md), or "being
gathered to his fathers" ([Jdg 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#010).md),
but is constantly distinguished from departing this life and being
buried, denotes the reunion in Sheol with friends who have gone before,
and therefore presupposes faith in the personal continuance of a man
after death, as a presentiment which the promises of God had exalted in
the case of the patriarchs into a firm assurance of faith ([Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013).md).

[Genesis 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 25:9</span></span>

The burial of the patriarch in the cave of Machpelah was attended to by
Isaac and Ishmael; since the latter, although excluded from the
blessings of the covenant, was acknowledged by God as the son of Abraham
by a distinct blessing ([Gen 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#020).md),
and was thus elevated above the sons of Keturah.

[Genesis 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 25:11</span></span>

After Abraham's death the blessing was transferred to Isaac, who took up
his abode by Hagar's well, because he had already been there, and had
dwelt in the south country ([Gen
24:62](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#062).md). The blessing of Isaac is
traced to Elohim, not to Jehovah; because it referred neither
exclusively nor pre-eminently to the gifts of grace connected with the
promises of salvation, but quite generally to the inheritance of earthly
possessions, which Isaac had received from his father.

[Genesis 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 25:12</span></span>

(Compare [Ch1 1:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#028).md)

To show that the promises of God, which had been made to Ishmael ([Gen
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#010.md). and [Gen
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#020).md), were fulfilled, a short
account is given of his descendants; and according to the settled plan
of Genesis, this account precedes the history of Isaac. This is
evidently the intention of the list which follows of the twelve sons of
Ishmael, who are given as princes of the tribes which sprang from them.
Nebajoth and Kedar are mentioned in [Isa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007.md) as rich possessors of flocks,
and, according to the current opinion which Wetzstein disputes, are the
Nabataei et Cedrei of Pliny (h. n. 5, 12). The Nabataeans held
possession of Arabia Petraea, with Petra as their capital, and
subsequently extended toward the south and north-east, probably as far
as Babylon; so that the name was afterwards transferred to all the
tribes to the east of the Jordan, and in the Nabataean writings became a
common name for Chaldeans (ancient Babylonians), Syrians, Canaanites,
and others. The Kedarenes are mentioned in [Isa
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#017.md) as good bowmen. They dwelt in
the desert between Arabia Petraea and Babylon ([Isa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011.md); [Psa
120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005).md). According to Wetzstein, they
are to be found in the nomad tribes of Arabia Petraea up to Harra. The
name Dumah, Δούμεθα Αουμαίθα (Ptol. v. 19, 7, Steph. Byz.), Domata
(Plin. 6, 32), has been retained in the modern Dumat el Jendel in Nejd,
the Arabian highland, four days' journey to the north of Taima. - Tema:
a trading people ([Job 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019.md); [Isa
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#014.md); mentioned in [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023), between Dedan and Bus.md) in the
land of Taima, on the border of Nejd and the Syrian desert. According to
Wetzstein, Dma and Tma are still two important places in Eastern Hauran,
three-quarters of an hour apart. Jetur and Naphish were neighbours of
the tribes of Israel to the east of the Jordan ([Ch1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#019).md), who made war upon them along
with the Hagrites, the Αγραῖοι of Ptol. and Strabo. From Jetur sprang
the Ituraeans, who lived, according to Strabo, near the Trachonians in
an almost inaccessible, mountainous, and cavernous country; according to
Wetzstein, in the mountains of the Druses in the centre of the Hauran,
possibly the forefathers of the modern Druses. The other names are not
yet satisfactorily determined. For Adbeel, Mibsam, and Kedma, the
Arabian legends give no corresponding names. Mishma is associated by
Knobel with the Μαισαιμανείς of Ptol. vi. 7, 21, to the N.E. of Medina;
Massa with the Μασανοί on the N.E. of Duma; Hadad (the proper reading
for Hadar, according to [Ch1 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#030.md), the
lxx, Sam., Masor., and most MSS) with the Arabian coast land, Chathth,
between Oman and Bahrein, a district renowned for its lancers (Χαττηνία,
Polyb.; Attene, Plin.).

[Gen 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#016.md)

These are the Ishmaelites "in their villages and encampments, twelve
princes according to their tribes." חצר: premises hedged round, then a
village without a wall in contrast with a walled town ([Lev
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#031).md). טירה: a circular encampment of
tents, the tent village of the Dur of the Bedouins. אמּות, here and [Num
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#015.md), is not used of nations, but of
the tribe-divisions or single tribes of the Ishmaelites and Midianites,
for which the word had apparently become a technical term among them.

[Gen 25:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#017.md)

Ishmael died at the age of 137, and his descendants dwelt in Havilah -
i.e., according to [Gen 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#029.md), the
country of the Chaulotaeans, on the borders of Arabia Petraea and Felix
- as far as Shur (the desert of Jifar, [Gen
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007).md) to the east of Egypt, "in the
direction of Assyria." Havilah and Shur therefore formed the
south-eastern and south-western boundaries of the territories of the
Ishmaelites, from which they extended their nomadic excursions towards
the N.E. as far as the districts under Assyrian rule, i.e., to the lands
of the Euphrates, traversing the whole of the desert of Arabia, or (as
Josephus says, Ant. i. 12, 4) dwelling from the Euphrates to the Red
Sea. Thus, according to the announcement of the angel, Ishmael "encamped
in the presence of all his brethren." נפל, to throw one's self, to
settle down, with the subordinate idea of keeping by force the place you
have taken ([Jdg 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#012).md). Luther wavers
between corruit, vel cecidit, vel fixit tabernaculum.

[Genesis 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 25:19</span></span>

According to the plan of Genesis, the history (tholedoth) of Isaac
commences with the birth of his sons. But to give it the character of
completeness in itself, Isaac's birth and marriage are mentioned again
in [Gen 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#019.md), [Gen
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020.md), as well as his age at the time
of his marriage. The name given to the country of Rebekah ([Gen
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020).md) and the abode of Laban in [Gen
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#002.md), [Gen
28:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#006.md); [Gen
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#018.md); [Gen
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018.md); [Gen
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#009.md), [Gen
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#026.md); [Gen
46:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#015.md), viz., Padan-Aram, or more
concisely Padan ([Gen 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007).md), "the
flat, or flat land of Aram," for which Hosea uses "the field of Aram"
([Hos 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012).md), is not a peculiar
expression employed by the Elohist, or in the so-called foundation-work,
for Aram Naharaim, Mesopotamia ([Gen
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010).md), but a more exact description
of one particular district of Mesopotamia, viz., of the large plain,
surrounded by mountains, in which the town of Haran was situated. The
name was apparently transferred to the town itself afterwards. The
history of Isaac consists of two stages: (1) the period of his active
life, from his marriage and the birth of his sons till the departure of
Jacob for Mesopotamia (Gen 25:20-28:9); and (2) the time of his
suffering endurance in the growing infirmity of age, when the events of
Jacob's life form the leading feature of the still further expanded
history of salvation (Gen 28:10-35:29). This suffering condition, which
lasted more than 40 years, reflected in a certain way the historical
position which Isaac held in the patriarchal triad, as a passive rather
than active link between Abraham and Jacob; and even in the active
period of his life many of the events of Abraham's history were repeated
in a modified form.

The name Jehovah prevails in the historical development of the tholedoth
of Isaac, in the same manner as in that of Terah; although, on closer
examination of the two, we find, first, that in this portion of Genesis
the references to God are less frequent than in the earlier one; and
secondly, that instead of the name Jehovah occurring more frequently
than Elohim, the name Elohim predominates in this second stage of the
history. The first difference arises from the fact, that the historical
matter furnishes less occasion for the introduction of the name of God,
just because the revelations of God are more rare, since the appearances
of Jehovah to Isaac and Jacob together are not so numerous as those to
Abraham alone. The second may be explained partly from the fact, that
Isaac and Jacob did not perpetually stand in such close and living faith
in Jehovah as Abraham, and partly also from the fact, that the previous
revelations of God gave rise to other titles for the covenant God, such
as "God of Abraham," "God of my father," etc., which could be used in
the place of the name Jehovah (cf. [Gen
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#024.md); [Gen
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#005.md), [Gen
31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042.md); [Gen
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001.md), [Gen
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#003.md), and the remarks on [Gen
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#009).md).

[Genesis 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 25:21</span></span>

Isaac's marriage, like Abraham's, was for a long time unfruitful; not to
extreme old age, however, but only for 20 years. The seed of the promise
was to be prayed for from the Lord, that it might not be regarded merely
as a fruit of nature, but be received and recognised as a gift of grace.
At the same time Isaac was to be exercised in the patience of faith in
the promise of God. After this lengthened test, Jehovah heard his prayer
in relation to his wife. לנוכח, [Gen
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#021.md) and [Gen
30:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#038.md), lit., opposite to, so that the
object is before the eyes, has been well explained by Luther thus: quod
toto pectore et intentus in calamitatem uxoris oraverit. Sicut quando
oro pro aliquo, propono illum mihi in conspectum cordis mei, et nihil
aliud video aut cogito; in eum solum animo intueor.

[Gen 25:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#022.md)

When Rebekah conceived, the children struggled together in her womb. In
this she saw an evil omen, that the pregnancy so long desired and
entreated of Jehovah would bring misfortune, and that the fruit of her
womb might not after all secure the blessing of the divine promise; so
that in intense excitement she cried out, "If it be so, wherefore am I?"
i.e., why am I alive? cf. [Gen 27:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#046.md).
But she sought counsel from God: she went to inquire of Jehovah. Where
and how she looked for a divine revelation in the matter, is not
recorded, and therefore cannot be determined with certainty. Some
suppose that it was by prayer and sacrifice at a place dedicated to
Jehovah. Others imagine that she applied to a prophet - to Abraham,
Melchizedek, or Shem (Luther); a frequent custom in Israel afterwards
([Sa1 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009).md), but not probable in the
patriarchal age. The divine answer, couched in the form of a prophetic
oracle, assured her that she carried two nations in her womb, one
stronger than the other; and that the greater (elder or first-born)
should serve the less (younger). הפּרד ממּעיך: "proceeding from thy
womb, are separated."

[Gen 25:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#024.md)

When she was delivered, there were twins; the first-born was reddish,
i.e., of a reddish-brown colour ([Sa1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012.md); [Sa1
17:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#042).md), and "all over like a hairy
cloak," i.e., his whole body as if covered with a fur, with an unusual
quantity of hair (hypertrichosis), which is sometimes the case with
new-born infants, but was a sign in this instance of excessive sensual
vigour and wildness. The second had laid hold of the heel of the first,
i.e., he came into the world with his hand projected and holding the
heel of the first-born, a sign of his future attitude towards his
brother. From these accidental circumstances the children received their
names. The elder they called Esau, the hairy one; the younger Jacob,
heel-holder: יעקב from עקב (denom. of עקב heel, [Hos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003).md), to hold the heel, then to
outwit ([Gen 27:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036).md), just as in
wrestling an attempt may be made to throw the opponent by grasping the
heel.

[Genesis 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 25:27</span></span>

Esau became "a cunning hunter, a man of the field," i.e., a man
wandering about in the fields. He was his father's favourite, for
"venison was in his mouth," i.e., he was fond of it. But Jacob was תּם
אישׁ, "a pious man" (Luther); תּם, integer, denotes here a disposition
that finds pleasure in the quiet life of home. אהלים ישׁב, not dwelling
in tents, but sitting in the tents, in contrast with the wild hunter's
life led by his brother; hence he was his mother's favourite.

[Genesis 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 25:29</span></span>

The difference in the characters of the two brothers was soon shown in a
singular circumstance, which was the turning-point in their lives. Esau
returned home one day from the field quite exhausted, and seeing Jacob
with a dish of lentils, still a favourite dish in Syria and Egypt, he
asked with passionate eagerness for some to eat: "Let me swallow some of
that red, that red there;" אדם, the brown-red lentil pottage. From this
he received the name Edom, just as among the ancient Arabians persons
received names from quite accidental circumstances, which entirely
obscured their proper names. Jacob made us of his brother's hunger to
get him to sell his birthright. The birthright consisted afterwards in a
double portion of the father's inheritance ([Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017).md); but with the patriarchs it
embraced the chieftainship, the rule over the brethren and the entire
family ([Gen 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029).md), and the title to
the blessing of the promise ([Gen
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#004.md), [Gen
27:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#027).md), which included the future
possession of Canaan and of covenant fellowship with Jehovah ([Gen
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#004).md). Jacob knew this, and it led him
to anticipate the purposes of God. Esau also knew it, but attached no
value to it. There is proof enough that he knew he was giving away,
along with the birthright, blessings which, because they were not of a
material but of a spiritual nature, had no particular value in his
estimation, in the words he made use of: "Behold I am going to die (to
meet death), and what is the birthright to me?" The only thing of value
to him was the sensual enjoyment of the present; the spiritual blessings
of the future his carnal mind was unable to estimate. In this he showed
himself to be βέβηλος ([Heb 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016).md), a
profane man, who cared for nothing but the momentary gratification of
sensual desires, who "did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way,
and so despised his birthright" ([Gen
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#034).md). With these words the
Scriptures judge and condemn the conduct of Esau. Just as Ishmael was
excluded from the promised blessing because he was begotten "according
to the flesh," so Esau lost it because his disposition was according to
the flesh. The frivolity with which he sold his birthright to his
brother for a dish of lentils, rendered him unfit to be the heir and
possessor of the promised grace. But this did not justify Jacob's
conduct in the matter. Though not condemned here, yet in the further
course of the history it is shown to have been wrong, by the simple fact
that he did not venture to make this transaction the basis of a claim.
