### [Exodus Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001)

[Exodus 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 29:1</span></span>

Consecration of Aaron and his Sons through the anointing of their
persons and the offering of sacrifices, the directions for which form
the subject of vv. 1-35. This can only be fully understood in connection
with the sacrificial law contained in Lev 1-7. It will be more advisable
therefore to defer the examination of this ceremony till we come to Lev
8, where the consecration itself is described. The same may also be said
of the expiation and anointing of the altar, which are commanded in [Exo
29:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#036) and [Exo
29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037), and carried out in [Lev
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#011).

[Exodus 29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">exo 29:38</span></span>

The Daily Burnt-Offering, Meat-Offering, and Drink-Offering. - The
directions concerning these are attached to the instructions for the
consecration of the priests, because these sacrifices commenced
immediately after the completion of the tabernacle, and, like the
shew-bread ([Exo 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030)), the daily
trimming of the lamps ([Exo 27:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020)),
and the daily incense-offering ([Exo
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007).), were most intimately connected
with the erection of the sanctuary.

[Exo 29:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038)

"And this is what thou shalt make (offer) upon the altar; yearling lambs
two a day continually," one in the morning, the other between the two
evenings (see at [Exo 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006)); to every
one a meat-offering (minchah) of a tenth of fine wheaten flour (soleth,
see at [Lev 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)), mixed with a quarter
of a hin of beaten oil (cathith, see at [Exo
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020)), and a drink-offering (nesek)
of a quarter of a hin of wine. עשּׂרן (a tenth) is equivalent to האיפה
עשׂירית, the tenth part of an ephah ([Num
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#005)), or 198-5 Parisian cubic inches
according to Bertheau's measurement. Thenius, however, sets it down at
101-4 inches, whilst the Rabbins reckon it as equivalent to 43 hen's
eggs of average size, i.e., somewhat more than 2 1/4 lbs. A hin (a word
of Egyptian origin) is 330-9 inches according to Bertheau, 168-9
according to Thenius, or 72 eggs, so that a quarter of a hin would be 18
eggs.

[Exo 29:41-46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#041)

להּ is to be understood ad sensum as referring to עולה. The daily
morning and evening sacrifices were to be "for a sweet savour, a firing
unto Jehovah" (see at [Lev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009)). In
these Israel was to consecrate its life daily unto the Lord (see at Lev
1 and 2). In order that the whole of the daily life might be included,
it was to be offered continually every morning and evening for all
future time ("throughout your generations" as at [Exo
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014)) at the door of the tabernacle,
i.e., upon the altar erected there, before Jehovah, who would meet with
the people and commune with them there (see [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022)). This promise is carried out
still further in [Exo 29:43-46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043). First
of all, for the purpose of elucidating and strengthening the words, "I
will meet with you there" ([Exo
29:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#042)), the presence and communion of
God, which are attached to the ark of the covenant in [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022), are ensured to the whole nation
in the words, "And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and it
(Israel) shall be sanctified through My glory." As the people were not
allowed to approach the ark of the covenant, but only to draw near to
the altar of burnt-offering in the sanctuary, it was important to
declare that the Lord would manifest Himself to them even there, and
sanctify them by His glory. Most of the commentators have taken the
altar to be the subject of "shall be sanctified;" but this is certainly
an error, not only because the altar is not mentioned in the previous
clause, and only slightly hinted at in the להּ in [Exo
29:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#041), but principally because the
sanctification of the altar is noticed by itself afterwards in [Exo
29:44](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#044). The correct exegesis is that
adopted by Baumgarten and others, who supply the word Israel (viz.,
regarded as a nation), which they take from the expression "children of
Israel" in the previous clause. In [Exo
29:44](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#044), the sanctification of the
tabernacle and altar on the part of God is promised, also that of His
servants, and finally, in [Exo 29:45](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#045),
[Exo 29:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#046), the abode of God in the
midst of the children of Israel, with an allusion to the blessings that
would follow from Jehovah's dwelling in the midst of them as their God
([Gen 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007)).
