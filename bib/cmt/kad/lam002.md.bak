Lamentation over the Judgment of Destruction That Has Come on Zion and
the Desolation of Judah

1 Alas! how the Lord envelopes the daughter of Zion in His wrath!

He hath cast down the glory of Israel from heaven to earth;

Nor hath He remembered His footstool in the day of His wrath.

2 The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, He hath not
spared:

He hath broken down, in His anger, the strongholds of the daughter of
Judah;

He hath smitten \[them\] down to the earth.

He hath profaned the kingdom and its princes.

3 He hath cut off, in the burning of wrath, every horn of Israel;

He hath drawn back His right hand from before the enemy,

And hath burned among Jacob like a flaming fire, \[which\] devours round
about.

4 He hath bent His bow like an enemy, standing \[with\] His right hand
like an adversary,

And He slew all the desires of the eye;

On the tent of the daughter of Zion hath He poured out His fury like
fire.

5 The Lord hath become like an enemy; He hath swallowed up Israel.

He hath swallowed up all her palaces, He hath destroyed his strongholds,

And hath increased on the daughter of Judah groaning and moaning.

6 And He hath violently treated His own enclosure, like a garden; He hat
destroyed His own place of meeting:

Jahveh hath caused to be forgotten in Zion the festival and the Sabbath,

And in the fierceness of His wrath He hath rejected king and priest.

7 The Lord hath spruned His own altar, He hath abhorred His own
sanctuary;

He hath delivered into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces;

They have made a noise in the house of Jahvey, as \[on\] the day of a
festival.

8 Jahveh hath purposed to destroy the walls of the daughter of Zion:

He hath stretched out a line, He hath not drawn back His hand from
demolishing;

And He hath made the rampart and the \[city\] wall to mourn; they sorrow
together.

9 Her gates have sunk into the earth; He hath destroyed and broken her
bars:

Her king and her princces are among the nations; there is no law.

Her prophets also find no vision from Jahveh.

10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they silent;

They have cast up dust upon their head, they have clothed themselves
with sackcloth garments:

The virgins of Jerusalem have brought down their head to the earth.

11 Mine eyes waste away with tears, My bowels glow,

My liver is poured out on the earth, because of the destruction of the
daughter of my people;

Because the young child and the suckling pine away in the streets of the
city.

12 They said to their mothers, Where is corn and wine?

When they were fainting like one wounded in the streets of the city,

When their soul was poured out into the bosom of their mothers.

13 What slall I testify against thee? what shall I compare to thee, O
daughter of Jerusalem?

What shall I liken to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter
of Zion?

For thy destruction is great, like the sea; who can heal thee?

14 Thy prophets have seen for thee vanity and absurdity,

And have not revealed thine iniquity, to turn thy captivity;

But they have seen for thee burdens of vanity, and expulsion.

15 All that pass by the way clap \[their\] hands against thee;

They hiss and shake their head against the daughter of Jerusalem
\[saying, "Is\] this the city that they call "The perfection of beauty,
a joy of the whole earth?'"

16 All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee:

They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, "We have swallowed \[her\];

Assuredly this is the day that we have expected; we have found \[it\],
we have seen \[it\]."

17 Jahveh hath done what He hath purposed:

He hath executed His word which He commanded from the days of yore: He
hath broken down, and hath not spared:

And He hath made the enemy rejoice over thee; He hath raised up the horn
of thine adversaries.

18 Their heart crieth out unto the Lord.

O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a stream by day
and by night:

Give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.

19 Arise, wail in the night; at the beginning of the watches,

Pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord:

Lift up thine hands to Him for the soul of thy young children,

That faint for hunger at the head of every street.

20 See, O Jahveh, and consider to whom Thou hast acted thus!

Shall women eat their \[body's\] fruit, the children of their care?

Or shall priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?

21 The boy and the old man lie without, on the ground;

My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword:

Thou hast slain in the day of Thy wrath, Thou hast slaughtered, Thou
hast not spared.

22 Thou summonest, as on a feast-day, my terrors round about;

And in the day of wrath of Jahveh there was no fugitive or survivor

Whom I would have nursed and brought up; mine enemy destroyed them.

This second poem contains a new and more bitter lamentation regarding
the fall of Jerusalem and the kingdom of Judah; and it is distinguished
from the first, partly by the bitterness of the complaint, but chiefly
by the fact that while, in the first, the oppressed, helpless, and
comfortless condition of Jerusalem is the main feature, - here, on the
other hand, it is the judgment which the Lord, in His wrath, has decreed
against Jerusalem and Judah, that forms the leading thought in the
complaint, as is shown by the prominence repeatedly given to the wrath,
rage, burning wrath, etc. ([Lam 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001)..md).
The description of this judgment occupies the first part of the poem
([Lam 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001).md); then follows, in the
second part ([Lam 2:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011).md), the
lamentation over the impotency of human consolation, and over the
scoffing of enemies at the misfortunes of Jerusalem ([Lam
2:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011).md). It was the Lord who sent
this judgment; and it is He alone who can give comfort and help in this
distress. To Him must the daughter of Zion betake herself with her
complaint ([Lam 2:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017).md); and this she
actually does in the concluding portion ([Lam
2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020).md).

Lamentations 2:1-22

Description of the judgment. - [Lam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md). The lamentation opens with signs
for the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. The first member of the
verse contains the general idea that the Lord (אדני, the Lord κατ ̓
ἐξοχὴν, very suitably used instead of יהוה) has, in His wrath, enveloped
Jerusalem with clouds. This thought is particularized in the two members
that follow, and is referred to the overthrow of Jerusalem and the
temple. יעיב, from עוּב (which is ἅπ. λεγ. as a verb, and is probably a
denominative from עב, a cloud), signifies to cover or surround with
clouds. בּאפּו does not mean "with His wrath" (Ewald, Thenius), but "in
His wrath," as is shown by [Lam 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003.md),
[Lam 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md), [Lam
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#021.md), [Lam
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022.md). "The daughter of Zion" here
means the city of Jerusalem, which in the second member is called "the
glory (or ornament) of Israel," by which we are to understand neither
res Judaeorum florentissimae in general (Rosenmller), nor the temple in
special, as the "splendid house," [Isa
64:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#010) (Michaelis, Vaihinger.md).
Jerusalem is called the glory or ornament of Israel, in the same way as
Babylon in [Isa 64:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#010.md) is called "the
glory of the splendour of the Chaldeans" (Thenius, Gerlach). In the
figurative expression, "He cast down from heaven to earth," we are not
to think there is any reference to a thunderbolt which knocks down an
object, such as a lofty tower that reaches to heaven (Thenius); "from
heaven" implies that what is to be thrown down was in heaven, as has
been already remarked by Raschi in his explanation, postquam sustulisset
eos (Judaeos) usque ad coelum, eosdem dejecit in terram, where we have
merely to substitute "Jerusalem," for eos, which is too vague. Gerlach
has rightly remarked that the expression "cast down from heaven" is to
be accounted for by the fact that, in the first member of the verse,
Jerusalem is compared to a star, in the same way as Babylon is expressly
called a tar in [Isa 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md); nay, what
is more, Jerusalem is here compared to a star that has fallen from
heaven; the reference to that passage thus becomes unmistakeable.
Moreover, the casting down from heaven means something more than
deprivation of the glory that had come on the city in consequence of
God's dwelling in the midst of it (Gerlach); it signifies, besides, the
destruction of the city, viz., that it would be laid in ashes. In all
this, the Lord has not been thinking of, i.e., paid any regard to, His
footstool, i.e., the ark of the covenant ([Ch1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md); [Psa
99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005)), - not the temple (Ewald.md),
although we cannot think of the ark without at the same thinking of the
temple as the house in which it was kept. The ark, and not the temple,
is named, because the temple became a habitation of the Lord, and a
place where He revealed Himself, only through the ark of the covenant,
with which the Lord had graciously connected His presence among His
people. It is further implied, in the fact that God does not think of
His footstool, that the ark itself was destroyed along with the temple
and the city.

[Lamentations 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 2:2</span></span>

The Lord has destroyed not merely Jerusalem, but the whole kingdom.
בּלּע, "to swallow up," involves the idea of utter annihilation, the
fury of destruction, just in the same way as it viz. the fury is
peculiar to עברה, the overflowing of anger. "He hath not spared" forms
an adverbial limitation of the previous statement, "unsparingly." The
Qeri ולא, instead of לא, is an unnecessary and unpoetic emendation.
כּל־נאות, all the pastures of Jacob. According to its etymology, נוה
means a place where shepherds or nomads rest, or stay, or live; here, it
is not to be understood specially of the dwellings as contrasted with,
or distinguished from the pasture-grounds, but denotes, in contrast with
the fortresses (מבצרים), the open, unfortified places of the country in
which men and cattle enjoy food and rest. "The strongholds of the
daughter of Judah" are not merely the fortifications of Jerusalem, but
the fortresses generally of the country and kingdom of Judah; cf. [Jer
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#017.md); [Jer
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007.md). הגּיע לארץ, "to cast down to the
ground" (used of the pulling down of walls, cf. [Isa
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#012).md), is an epexegesis of חרס, as in
[Exo 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#014.md), and is not to be joined
(in opposition to the accents) with what succeeds, and taken
figuratively. For neither does חלּל need any strengthening, nor does
הגּיע לארץ suitably apply to the kingdom and its princes. The
desecration of the kingdom consisted in its being dishonoured by the
disgraceful conduct of its rulers; cf. [Psa
89:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#040.md).

[Lamentations 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 2:3</span></span>

In [Lam 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003.md) and [Lam
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004.md), the writer describes the hostile
conduct of the Lord towards Israel, by which the kingdom of Judah was
destroyed. Thenius utterly mistakes the poetic character of the
description given, and evidently finds in it the several events that
occurred up to the taking of the city, all mentioned in their natural
order; according to this, the perfects would require to be translated as
preterites. But this view can be made out only by giving an arbitrary
meaning to the several figures used; e.g., it is alleged that "every
horn" means the frontier fortresses, that the expression "before the
enemy" refers to the time when the latter turned his face against
Jerusalem, and so on. The three members of [Lam
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003.md) contain a climax: deprivation of
the power to resist; the withdrawal of aid; the necessary consequence of
which was the burning like a flame of fire. "To cut down the horn" means
to take away offensive and defensive power; see on [Jer
48:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#025.md). "Every horn" is not the same as
"all horns," but means all that was a horn of Israel (Gerlach). This
included not merely the fortresses of Judah, but every means of defence
and offence belonging to the kingdom, including men fit for war, who are
neither to be excluded nor (with Le Clerc) to be all that is understood
by "every horn." In the expression ימינו...השׁיב, the suffix, as in
קשׁתּו, [Lam 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004.md), refers to Jahveh,
because the suffix joined to יד always points back to the subject of the
verb השׁיב; cf. [Psa 74:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#011.md). God drew
back His hand before the enemy, i.e., He withdrew from the people His
assistance in the struggle against the enemy. Such is the meaning given
long ago by the Chaldee: nec auxiliatus est populo suo coram hoste.
ויּבער בּיעקב does not mean "He consumed Jacob;" but He burned (i.e.,
made a conflagration) in Jacob; for, in every passage in which בּער is
construed with בּ, it does not mean to "burn something," but to burn in
or among, or to kindle a fire (cf. [Job
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016.md), where the burning up is only
expressed by ותּאכלם, [Num 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#003.md); [Psa
106:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#018).md), or to set something on fire,
[Isa 42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025.md). The burning represents
devastation; hence the comparison of יבער with "like fire of flame (=
flaming, brightly blazing fire, cf. [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md); [Psa
105:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#032).md) that devours round about." The
subject of יבער is Jahveh, not ira Jovae (Rosenmller), or להבה
(Neumann), or the enemy (Gerlach). The transition from the perfect with
ו consec. does not cause any change of the subject; this is shown by
[Lam 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004.md) and [Lam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005.md), where also the second clause is
connected with the first by means of ו consec. But the statement of
Gerlach - that if Jahveh and not the enemy be the subject, then the
consecutive sentence (the burning among Jacob as the result of the
withdrawal of Jahveh's hand before the enemy) would be inexplicable -
gives no evidence of its truth. The kindling or making of the fire in
Jacob is, of course, represented as a result of what is previously
stated, yet not as the consequence merely of the withdrawal of his hand,
but also of the cutting off of every horn. In both of these ways, God
has kindled in Jacob a fire which grows into a destructive
conflagration. - In [Lam 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004.md) the idea
is still further developed: God not merely delivered up His people to
the enemy, leaving them defenceless and helpless, but also came forward
Himself to fight against them as an enemy. He bent His bow like a
warrior, showing Himself, in reference to His claims, as an adversary or
oppressor. The specification "His right hand" is added, not so much for
the purpose of defining more exactly the activity of the right hand
(using it to shoot the arrows or wield the sword; cf. [Deu
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041.md)., [Psa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013)..md), as rather with the view of
expressing more precisely the hostile attitude of God, since the right
hand of God is at other times represented as the instrument of help. The
expression "and He slew," which follows, does not require us to think of
a sword in the right hand of God, since we can also kill with arrows.
God slew as an enemy; He destroyed everything that was precious in men's
sight, i.e., to merely omnes homines aetate, specie, dignitate
conspicuos (C. B. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Thenius); for, in [Psa
78:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#047.md), חרג is also used with reference
to the effect of hail on the vine; and the arrows shot from the bow are
merely named by synecdoche, and by way of specification, as instruments
of war for destruction. Still less can מחמדּי־עין signify omnia ea
templi ornamenta, quibus merito gloriabatur populus (Kalkschmidt), since
it is not till [Lam 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md). that the
temple is spoken of. "The word is to be taken in its widest generality,
which is indicated by 'all;' accordingly, it comprehends everything that
can be looked upon as dear," including children (cf. [Eze
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#025).md) and the sanctuary, though all
these do not exhaust the meaning of the word (Gerlach). Upon the tent of
the daughter of Zion He poured out His fury in fire. The daughter of
Zion means the inhabitants of Jerusalem: her tent is not the temple
(Kalkschmidt, Ewald), which is never called the tent of the daughter of
Zion, but only that of Jahveh ([Kg1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028), etc..md); but her house, i.e., the
city as a collection of dwellings. The figure of the outpouring of wrath
is often used, not only in [Jer 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011.md);
[Jer 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025.md); [Jer
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018.md), etc., but also in [Hos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010.md); [Zep
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md); [Psa
69:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#025.md); [Psa
76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006.md), etc.

[Lamentations 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 2:5</span></span>

The Lord has become like an enemy. כּאויב is not separated from היה by
the accents (Pesik and Mahpak before, and Kadma after); so that there
appears to be nothing to justify the remark of Gerlach, that, "as if the
prophet were hesitating whether he should state explicitly that the Lord
had become an enemy, he breaks off the sentence he had begun, 'The Lord
hath become...,' and continues, 'He hath destroyed like a mighty one.' "
As to בּלּע, cf. [Lam 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002.md). "Israel" is
the name of Judah viewed as the covenant people. The swallowing or
destruction of Israel is explained in the clauses which follow as a
destruction of the palaces and fortresses. The mention of the palaces
points to the destruction of Jerusalem, while the "fortresses" similarly
indicate the destruction of the strong cities in the country. The
interchange of the suffixes ־יה and ־יו is accounted for on the ground
that, when the writer was thinking of the citadels, the city hovered
before his mind; and when he regarded the fortresses, the people of
Israel similarly presented themselves. The same interchange is found in
[Hos 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md); the assumption of a textual
error, therefore, together with the conjectures based on that
assumption, is shown to be untenable. On the expression, "He hath
destroyed his strongholds," cf. [Jer
47:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md) :18; on תּאניּה ואניּה, [Isa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002.md) : in this latter case, two
word-forms derived from the same stem are combined for the sake of
emphasis. "Daughter of Judah," as in [Lam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002.md), cf. [Lam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015.md).

[Lamentations 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 2:6</span></span>

In [Lam 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md) and [Lam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md), mention is made of the
destruction of the temple and the cessation of public worship. "He
treated violently (cruelly)," i.e., laid waste, "like a garden, His
enclosure." שׂך (from שׂוּך = שׂכך, to intertwine, hedge round)
signifies a hedge or enclosure. The context unmistakeably shows that by
this we are to understand the temple, or the holy place of the temple;
hence שׂך is not the hedging, but what is hedged in. But the comparison
כּגּן has perplexed expositors, and given occasion for all kinds of
artificial and untenable explanations. We must not, of course, seek for
the point of the comparison in the ease with which a garden or
garden-fence may be destroyed, for this does not accord with the
employment of the verb חמס; but the garden is viewed as a
pleasure-ground, which its owner, if it does not suit its purpose,
destroys or gives up again, without much hesitation. The emphasis lies
on the suffix in שׂכּו, "His own enclosure," God's enclosure = the
sacred enclosure (Gerlach), the sanctuary protected by Himself,
protected by laws intended to keep the sanctity of the temple from
profanation. The second clause states the same thing, and merely brings
into prominence another aspect of the sanctity of the temple by the
employment of the word מועדו. This noun, as here used, does not mean the
"time," but the "place of meeting;" this is not, however, the place
where the people assemble, but the place of meeting of the Lord with His
people, where He shows Himself present, and grants His favour to the
congregation appearing before Him. Thus, like אהל מועד, the word
signifies the place where God reveals His gracious presence to His
people; cf. [Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md), and the
explanation of נועדתּי given in that passage. In the first member of the
verse, the temple is viewed as a place sacred to God; in the second, as
the place where He specially manifests His gracious presence in Israel.
With the destruction of the temple, Jahveh (the covenant God) caused
feast and Sabbath, i.e., all public festivals and divine service, to be
forgotten. The destruction of the sacred spots set apart for the worship
of the Lord was attended with the cessation of the sacred festivals.
Thereby it became evident that the Lord, in His fierce anger, had
rejected king and priest. The singulars, festival, Sabbath, king, and
priest, are used in unrestricted generality. King and priest are
regarded as the divinely chosen media of the covenant graces. The
abolition of public worship practically involved that of the priesthood,
for the service of the priests was connected with the temple. Expositors
are much divided in their views regarding the object for which the king
is here mentioned in connection with the priest. There is no special
need for refuting the opinion of Thenius, that king and priest are named
as the two main factors in the worship of God, because the seat of the
king was upon Zion as well as that of the priesthood; for the seat of
the priests was as little on Mount Zion as the king's palace was on the
temple mount. Moreover, the words do not treat of the destruction of the
royal palace and the dwellings of the priests, but declare that royalty
and the priesthood will be rejected. The mention of the king in
connection with the priests implies a close connection also of royalty
with the temple. Ngelsbach, accordingly, is of opinion that the kings
also belong to the number of those summoned to celebrate the feasts, and
were not merely Jehovah's substitutes before the people, but also
"representatives of the people before God;" for he adopts the remark of
Oehler (in Herzog's Real Enc. viii. S. 12), that "the Israelitish
kingdom (especially in David and Solomon) bears a certain sacerdotal
character, inasmuch as the king, at the head of the people and in their
name, pays homage to God, and brings back again to the people the
blessing of God ([Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md).; [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md); [Kg1
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014.md)., 55ff., 62ff., [Kg1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025.md); [Ch1
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#010.md).; [Ch2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#006.md), compared with [Eze
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#001)..md)." This sacerdotal character of
royalty, however, was but the outcome of the sacerdotal character of the
people of Israel. In view of this, the king, because of his position as
the head of the people in civil matters (for he was praecipuum ecclesiae
membrum), fully brought out the relation of the people to the Lord,
without, however, discharging any peculiarly sacerdotal function. The
complaint in the present verse, - that, with the destruction of the
temple, and the abolition of the service connected with it, Jahveh had
rejected king and priest, - implies that royalty in Israel stood in as
intimate connection with the temple as the priesthood did. This
connection, however, is not to be sought for so much in the fact that it
was the incumbent duty of the theocratic king, in the name and at the
head of the people, to pay homage to God, and to see that the public
worship of Jahve was upheld; we must rather seek for it in the intimate
relation instituted by God between the maintenance of the Davidic
monarchy and the building of the house of God. This connection is
exhibited in the promise made by God to David, when the latter had
resolved to build a house for the Lord to dwell in: He (Jahveh) shall
build a house to him (David), viz., raise up his seed after him, and
establish his kingdom for ever; and this seed of David shall build a
house to His name ([Sa2 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)..md). This
promise, in virtue of which Solomon built the temple as a dwelling for
the name of Jahveh, connected the building of the temple so closely with
the kingdom of David, that this continued existence of the temple might
be taken as a pledge of the continuance of David's house; while the
destruction of the temple, together with the abolition of the public
ministrations, might, on the other hand, serve as a sign of the
rejection of the Davidic monarchy. Viewing the matter in this light,
Jeremiah laments that, with the destruction of the temple and the
abolition of the public festivals, Jahveh has rejected king and priest,
i.e., the royal family of David as well as the Levitical priesthood.

In [Lam 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md), special mention is
further made of the rejection of the altar, and of the sanctuary as the
centre of divine worship. The verbs זנח and נאר are used in [Psa
89:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md), in connection with the
rejection of the Davidic monarchy. "The sanctuary," mentioned in
connection with "the altar," does not mean the temple in general, but
its inner sanctuary, - the holy place and the most holy place, as the
places of worship corresponding to the altar of the fore-court. The
temple-building is designated by "the walls of her palaces." For, that
by ארמנותיה we are to understand, not the palaces of the city of David,
the royal palaces, but the towering pile of the temple, is unmistakeably
evident from the fact that, both before and after, it is the temple that
is spoken of, - not its fortifications, the castles specially built for
its defence (Thenius); because ארמון does not mean a fortified building,
but (as derived from ארם, to be high) merely a lofty pile. Such were the
buildings of the temple in consequence of their lofty situation on
Moriah. In the house of Jahveh, the enemy raises a loud cry (נתן קול,
cf. [Jer 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020).md), as on a feast-day.
The cry is therefore not a war-cry (Pareau, Rosenmller), but one of
jubilee and triumph, as if they had come into the temple to a festival:
in [Psa 74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004.md), the word used is שׁאג,
to roar as a lion.

[Lamentations 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 2:8</span></span>

The lament over the destruction of the kingdom concludes, in [Lam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008.md), [Lam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009.md), by mentioning that the walls of
Jerusalem are destroyed; with this the Chaldeans ended the work of
demolition. The expression חשׁב יהוה represents this as the execution of
a divine decree, - a turn which forms an appropriate introduction to the
close of the work of destruction. "Raschi makes the following remark
concerning this: a longo inde tempore, in animum induxerat, hanc urbem
vastare secundum illud quod [Jer 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#031.md)
dixit. This intention He has now carried out. The words, "He stretched
out the measuring-line," are more exactly determined by what follows,
"He withdrew not His hand from destroying;" this shows the extent to
which the destruction was carried out. The measuring-line was drawn out
for the purpose of determining the situation and direction of buildings
([Job 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#005.md); [Zac
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015).md); but Jahveh applies it also for
the purpose of pulling down buildings ([Kg2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013.md); [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md); [Amo
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007).md), in order to indicate that He
carried out the destruction with the same precision as that of the
builder in finishing his work. The rampart and the wall sorrow over
this. חל (from חוּל) is the rampart, i.e., the low wall with the ditch,
surrounding the fortress outside the city wall; cf. [Sa2
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015.md); [Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md). The gates of the daughter of
Zion (i.e., of Jerusalem) are sunk into the earth, i.e., have been
completely buried under rubbish by the demolition, as if they had sunk
into the ground. The subject to אבּד ושׁבּר is Jahveh. The bars of the
daughter of Zion are those with which the city gates were closed, for
the protection of the inhabitants. With the destruction of Jerusalem the
kingdom of God is destroyed. King and princes are among the heathen, -
carried away into exile. It must, indeed, be allowed that אין תּורה is
connected by the accents with what precedes; and Gerlach defends the
construction, "they are among the heathen without law,", - not only
agreeing with Kalkschmidt in taking אין תּורה as a designation of the
גּוים as ethnici, - -ad gentes, quibus divina nulla erat revelatio, -
but also with Luther, who translates: "her king and her princes are
among the heathen, because they cannot administer the law," or
generally, have it not. But, on the other hand, the accents merely
indicate the stichometrical arrangement, not the relation of the words
according to their sense; and the remark, "that [Lam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009.md) sets forth the fate of the persons
who stood to the city in the relation of helpers and counsellors or
comforters (her king, her prophets), of whose help (counsel, or comfort)
the city was deprived, as well as of the external means of defending
her" (first member), proves nothing at all, for the simple reason that
the priests also belonged to the number of the helpers, counsellors, and
comforters of the city; hence, if this were the meaning, and the two
halves of the verse were meant to stand in this relation, then the
priests would certainly have been mentioned also. The second half of the
verse is not connected with the first in the manner supposed by Gerlach;
but, from the whole preceding description of the way in which the divine
wrath has been manifested against Jerusalem, it draws this conclusion:
"Judah has lost its king and its princes, who have been carried away
among the heathen: it has also lost the law and prophecy." "Law" and
"vision" are mentioned as both media of divine revelation. the law is
the summary of the rule of life given by God to His people: this exists
no more for Judah, because, with the destruction of Jerusalem and of the
temple, the divinely appointed constitution of Israel was abolished and
destroyed. Prophecy was the constant witness to the presence of God
among His people; by this means the Lord sought to conduct Israel to the
object of their election and calling, and to fit them for becoming a
holy nation and a kingdom of priests. The perf. מצאוּ is not a
preterite, but the expression of an accomplished fact. The prophets of
the daughter of Zion no longer obtain any vision or revelation from
Jahveh: the revelation of God by prophets has ceased for Zion. The words
imply that there are still prophets, and merely affirm that they do not
receive any revelation from God. This is not opposed to the fact that
Jeremiah, some months after the destruction of Jerusalem, again received
a revelation; cf. [Jer 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004.md) with [Lam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md). The meaning of the complaint is
simply that Jahveh no longer owns His people, no longer gives them a
token of His gracious presence, just as it is said in [Psa
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md), "There is no more any prophet."
But it is not thereby declared that prophecy has altogether and for ever
been silenced, but merely that, when Jerusalem was destroyed, Israel
received no prophetic communication, - that God the Lord did not then
send them a message to comfort and sustain them. The revelation which
Jeremiah ([Jer 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007).md) received
regarding the determination of the people who sought to flee to Egypt,
has no connection with this at all, for it does not contain a word as to
the future destiny of Jerusalem. Hence it cannot be inferred, with
Thenius, from the words now before us, that the present poem was
composed before that revelation given in [Jer
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007.md).; nor yet, with Ngelsbach, that
the writer had here before his mind the condition of the great mass of
the people who had been carried away into exile. Neither, indeed, were
the people in exile without prophetic communications; for, even so early
as six years before the overthrow of Jerusalem, God had raised up to the
exiles a prophet in the person of Ezekiel.

[Lamentations 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 2:10</span></span>

The whole of the people have sunk into deep sorrow over this misfortune.
The elders, as the counsellors of the city, sit on the ground in
silence, from deep sorrow; cf. [Job
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008.md), [Job
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md), and regarding the tokens of
sorrow, [Job 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012.md); [Jer
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008.md); [Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md), etc. the virgins of Jerusalem
have renounced their gaiety and bowed their head, sorrowing, to the
ground; cf. [Lam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md).

[Lamentations 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 2:11</span></span>

The impotence of human comfort, and the mockery of enemies. [Lam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md). The misery that has befallen the
people is so fearful, that sorrow over it wears out one's life. "Mine
eyes pine away because of tears," is the complaint of the prophet, not
merely for himself personally, but in the name of all the godly ones.
"Mine eyes pine" is the expression used in [Psa
69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004.md). On חמרמרוּ מעי, cf. [Lam
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020.md). The expression, "my liver is
poured out on the earth," occurs nowhere else, and is variously
explained. That the liver is fons sanguinis, and thus the seat of the
animal life (Rosenmller, Thenius), cannot be made out from [Pro
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#023.md). This passage rather forms a
proof that among the Hebrews, according to a view widely prevalent in
ancient times, the liver was considered the seat of sensual desire and
lust (cf. Delitzsch's Bib. Psychology, Clark's translation, p. 316). But
this view is insufficient as an explanation of the passage now before
us. Besides, there are no proofs to show that "liver" is used for
"heart," or even for "gall," although [Job
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013.md) is unwarrantably adduced in
support of this position. A closely related expression, certainly, is
found in [Job 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#016.md); [Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md), where the soul is said to be
poured out; but the liver is different from נפשׁ, the principle of the
corporeal life. If the liver was called כּבד because, according to
Galen, de usu partium, vi. 17 (in Gesen. Thes. p. 655), omnium viscerum
et densissimum et gravissimum est, then it may be regarded, instead of
מעים, as the chief bodily organ through which not merely lust, but also
pain, is felt; and the pouring out of the liver on the earth may thus
mean that the inner man is dissolved in pain and sorrow, - perishes, as
it were, through pain. For it is evident from the context, and
universally admitted, that it is the effect of pain in consuming the
bodily organs that is here meant to be expressed. שׁבר בּת עמּי is a
genuine Jeremianic expression (cf. [Jer
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md); [Jer
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011.md), [Jer
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#021), etc..md), which again occurs in
[Lam 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013.md), [Lam
3:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#047.md), and [Lam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010.md). In what follows, some harrowing
details are given regarding the destruction of the daughter of Zion.
בּעטף for בּהעטף, while (or because) children and sucklings were pining
away on the streets of the city. This figure of heartrending misery is
further carried out in [Lam 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012.md), for
the purpose of vividly setting forth the terrible distress. Gerlach is
wrong in thinking that the writer brings forward such sad scenes as
would be likely to present themselves in the period immediately after
the destruction of the city. For, the fact that, in [Lam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010.md), the eye of the mourner is
directed to the present, is far from being a proof that [Lam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md) and [Lam
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012.md) also treat of the present; and
the imperfect יאמרוּ, [Lam 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012.md), is
not parallel in time with ישׁבוּ, [Lam
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012.md), but designates the repetition of
the action in past time. "The children say to their mothers, Where is
corn and wine?" i.e., Give us bread and wine, or, Where can we eat and
drink? Corn and must (as in [Jer
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#012), etc..md) are mentioned as the
usual means of nourishment of the Israelites. דּגן, "corn," is used
poetically for bread (cf. [Psa 78:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#024).md),
- not pounded or roasted grain, which was used without further
preparation (Thenius), and which is called קלי, [Lev
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014.md); [Sa1
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#017.md); [Sa2
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#028.md). The sucklings poured out their
soul, i.e., breathed out their life, into the bosom of their mothers,
i.e., hugging their mothers, although these could not give them
nourishment; cf. [Lam 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004.md).

[Lamentations 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 2:13</span></span>

Against such terrible misery, human power can give neither comfort nor
help. "What shall I testify to you?" the Kethib אעודך is a mistake in
transcription for אעידך (Qeri), because עוּד is not commonly used in the
Kal. העיד, to bear witness, is mostly construed with בּ, against or for
any one, but also with acc., [Kg1
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#010.md), [Kg1
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#013.md), in malam, and [Job
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#011.md), in bonam partem. Here it is
used in the latter sense: "give testimony to thee" for the purpose of
instruction and comfort, - not of a calamity that has happened
elsewhere, as Calvin and Thenius explain, though against the
construction of the verb with the accus.; still less "to make one swear"
(Gesenius, Ewald). That the prophetic witness is meant here in the sense
of encouragement by instruction, warning, and comfort, is evident from
the mention of the testimony of the false prophets in [Lam
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014.md). "What shall I compare to thee?"
i.e., what kind of misfortune shall I mention as similar to yours? This
is required by the principle derived from experience: solamen miseris
socios habuisse malorum. ואנחמך, "that I may comfort thee." The reason
assigned, viz., "for thy destruction is great, like the sea" (i.e.,
immense), follows the answer, understood though not expressed, "I can
compare nothing to thee." The answer to the last question, "Who can heal
thee?" (רפא with ל) is, "no man;" cf. [Jer
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#012.md). Reasons are assigned for this
in [Lam 2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014.md).

[Lamentations 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 2:14</span></span>

From her prophets, Jerusalem can expect neither comfort nor healing. For
they have brought this calamity upon her through their careless and
foolish prophesyings. Those meant are the false prophets, whose conduct
Jeremiah frequently denounced; cf. [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008.md); [Jer
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012.md); [Jer
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013.md)., [Jer
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#010.md); [Jer
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#014.md)., [Jer
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017.md), [Jer
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#032.md); [Jer
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#010.md), [Jer
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#015.md). They prophesied vanity, - peace
when there was no peace, - and תפל, "absurdity," = תּפלה, [Jer
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013.md). They did not expose the sin and
guilt of the people with the view of their amendment and improvement,
and thereby removing the misery into which they had fallen by their sin;
nor did they endeavour to restore the people to their right relation
towards the Lord, upon which their welfare depended, or to avert their
being driven into exile. On השׁיב שׁבוּת, cf. [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044.md). The meaning of this expression,
as there unfolded, applies also to the passage now before us; and the
translation, captivitatem avertere (Michaelis, Ngelsbach), or to "ward
off thy captivity" (Luther, Thenius), is neither capable of vindication
nor required by the context. Instead of healing the injuries of the
people by discovering their sins, they have seen (prophesied) for them
משׂאות, "burdens," i.e., utterances of threatening import (not effata;
see on [Jer 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033).md), which contained
שׁוא, "emptiness," and מדּוּחים, "rejection." The combination of
"emptiness" with "burdens" does not prevent the latter word from being
applied to threatening oracles; for the threats of the false prophets
did not refer to Judah, but were directed against the enemies of Israel.
For instance, that they might promise the people speedy deliverance from
exile, they placed the downfall of the Chaldean power in immediate
prospect; cf. [Jer 28:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002.md), [Jer
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#011.md). מדּוּחים, is ἅπ. λεγ. as a
noun, and is also dependent on "burdens" (cf. Ewald, 289, c): it
signifies ejection from the land, not "persecution" (Rosenmller,
Gesenius, Ewald, etc.), for Jeremiah uses נדח (in Niph. and Hiph.)
always in the sense of rejection, expulsion from the country; and the
word has here an unmistakeable reference to [Jer
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#010.md), [Jer
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#015.md) : "They prophesy lies to you,
that they may eject you from your country."

Strangers and enemies have, for the misfortune of Jerusalem, only
expressions of scorn and delight over her loss. "Those who pass by the
way" are strangers who travel past Jerusalem. To clap the hands together
is not here a gesture betokening anger and disinclination ([Num
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010).md), but of delight over the injury
of others, as in [Job 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023.md). שׂרק, to
hiss, is an expression of scorn; see on [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md). The same is true as regards the
shaking of the head; cf. [Psa 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008.md);
[Psa 109:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#025.md), etc.: the expression for
this, in [Jer 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md), is הניד בּראשׁ.
The exclamation, "Is this the city which they call 'perfect in beauty'?"
is an expression of scornful astonishment. כּלילת יפי is substantially
the same as מכלל יפי, [Psa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002.md), where
the expression is applied to Zion; in [Eze
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#003.md) the same is said of Tyre. That
Jeremiah had [Psa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002.md) in his mind is
shown by the apposition, "a joy of the whole earth," which is taken from
[Psa 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003.md).

The enemy in triumph express their joy over the fall of Jerusalem. The
opening of the mouth (as in [Psa
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md); [Job
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010).md), taken in connection with what
follows, is also a gesture peculiar to scornful speech. The gnashing of
the teeth ([Psa 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016.md); [Psa
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012.md); [Job
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009).md) is here an expression of rage
that has burst out. The object of "we have swallowed" is to be derived
from the context ("against thee"), viz., the city of Jerusalem. Surely
this" is a strong asseveration - "this is the very day." The asyndetic
collection of the three verbs accords with the impassioned character of
the enemy's speech. "To see" is here equivalent to living to see.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 2:17</span></span>

In this calamity, which Jahveh has ordained, it is only He who can bring
comfort and help; \[and this He will do\], if earnest and incessant
complaint be made to Him regarding the misery. In order to turn the
thoughts of the people in this direction, the prophet lays emphasis on
the fact that God has now executed this destruction which He has
threatened long before, and has prepared for the triumph of the enemy.
"Jahveh hath done what He hath purposed," has now performed the word
which He has commanded all along from the days of yore. Zechariah ([Zac
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#006).md) also lays this truth before the
heart of his contemporaries. בּצּע, to cut off, is used metaphorically
in the sense of finishing, completing, as in [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md); [Zac
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#009.md). To fulfil a word that has been
ordered, signifies to execute it. צוּה does not mean to announce, but to
command, order; the word has been chosen, not merely with reference to
the fact that the threatened rejection of Israel was announced in the
law, but also with regard to the circumstance that the threat of
punishment for sins is an evidence of the moral government of the world,
and the holiness of the Lord and Ruler of the world demands the
punishment of every act of rebellion against the government and decrees
of God. "The days of old" are the times of Moses; for Jeremiah has
before his mind the threatenings of the law, [Lev
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#023.md)., [Deu
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015.md). "Without sparing," as Jeremiah
([Jer 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028).md) has announced to the
people. In the following clause, "He hath made thine enemy rejoice over
thee," thoughts are reproduced from [Psa
89:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#043.md). To "exalt the horn" means to
grant power and victory; cf. [Sa1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md); [Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005.md).

[Lam 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018.md)

When it is seen that the Lord has appointed the terrible calamity, the
people are driven to pray for mercy. Hence [Lam
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018.md) follows, yet not at once with the
summons to prayer, but with the assertion of the fact that this actually
takes place: "their heart cries out unto the Lord;" and it is not till
after this that there follows the summons to entreat Him incessantly
with tears. The perfect צעק represents the crying as already begun, and
reaching on to the present (cf. Ewald, 135, b), for which we use the
present in German \[and in English\]. That the suffix in "their heart"
does not point to the enemies mentioned at the close of [Lam
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017.md), but to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, is indubitably evident from what is substantially stated in
the clause, viz., that crying to the Lord merely indicates the crying to
God for help in distress. There is no sufficient reason for Ewald's
change of צעק ל into צעקי לבּך, "outcries of thine heart," i.e., let the
cry of thine heart sound forth; still less ground is there for the
conjecture of Thenius, that לבּם should be changed into חנּם, because
this is opposed to the following summons to implore help: other more
unnatural changes in the text it were needless to mention. The following
clauses, "O wall of the daughter of Zion," etc., do not state how her
heart has cried and still cries to the Lord, but bid her constantly go
on imploring. Several expositors have taken objection to the direct
address, "O wall of the daughter of Zion," and have sought to remove the
difficulty by making conjectures. Hence, e.g., Thenius still holds that
there is good ground for the objection, saying that there is a wide
difference between the poetic expression, "the wall mourns" ([Lam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008).md), and the summons, "O wall, let
tears run down." This difference cannot be denied, yet such
personification is not without analogy. A similar summons is found in
[Isa 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031) : "Howl, O gate" (porta.md).
It is self-evident that it is not the wall simply as such that is
considered, but everything besides connected with it, so that the wall
is named instead of the city with its inhabitants, just as in [Isa
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031.md) gate and city are synonymous.
Hence, also, all the faculties of those residing within the wall (eyes,
heart, hands) may be ascribed to it, inasmuch as the idea of the wall
easily and naturally glides over into that of the daughter of Zion. The
expression, "Let tears run down like a stream," is a hyperbole used to
indicate the exceeding greatness of the grief. "By day and night" is
intensified by the clauses which follow: "give not," i.e., grant not.
פּוּגת לך , "torpidity (stagnation) to thyself." The noun פּוּגה is ἅπ.
λεγ., like הפוּגה, [Lam 3:49](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#049.md); the verb
פּוּג, however, occurs in [Gen 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#026.md)
and [Psa 77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003.md), where it is used of the
torpidity of the vital spirits, stagnation of the heart. The expression
in the text is a poetic one for פּוּגתך: "do not permit thy numbness,"
i.e., let not thy flood of tears dry up; cf. Ewald, 289, b. בּת עין is
the eyeball, not the tears (Pareau); cf. [Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md). תּדּם comes from דּמם, to be
still, as in [Jer 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#006.md). On the thought
here presented, cf. [Jer 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017.md).

[Lam 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019.md)

רנן (prop. to raise a whining cry, but commonly "to shout for joy") here
means to weep aloud, lament. לראשׁ אשׁמרות, at the beginning of the
night-watches (cf. [Jdg 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#019).md); not "in
the first night-watch" (Kalkschmidt, following Bochart and Ngelsbach),
but at the beginning of each night-watch, i.e., throughout the night;
cf. [Psa 63:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#007.md). "Pour out thine heart
like water before the face of the Lord," i.e., utter the sorrow of thine
heart in tears to the Lord. The uplifting of the hands is a gesture
indicative of prayer and entreaty (cf. [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md); [Psa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005), etc..md), not "of the deepest
distress" (Thenius). על־נפשׁ does not mean pro vita parvulorum tuorum,
that God may at least preserve them (Rosenmller, Gerlach), but "on
account of the soul of thy children," which is more distinctly stated,
in the following relative sentence, to mean that they have breathed out
their soul through hunger. On this matter, cf. [Lam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md) and the exposition of that verse.
Ewald has placed the last member of the verse within parentheses, as an
interpolation, on the ground that a fourth member offends against the
law observed in these verses; on the other hand, Thenius is of opinion
that the words do not form a member of the verse by themselves, but are
a mere prolongation of the third, "because the conclusion of the
prophet's address, begun in [Lam 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019.md),
was certainly intended to be a complete finish." But the deviation from
the rule is not thereby accounted for. Inasmuch as the words are
essential to the expression of the thought, we must simply acknowledge
the irregularity, and not arbitrarily cast suspicion on the genuineness
of the words.

[Lamentations 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 2:20</span></span>

In [Lam 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md) follows the prayer which
the city has been commanded to make. The prayer sets before the mind of
the Lord the terrible misery under which Jerusalem suffers. The
question, "To whom hast Thou acted thus?" does not mean, "What innocent
and godly ones are being sacrificed?" (Thenius), but "to what nation?" -
not a heathen one, but the people of thy choice, to whom all Thy blessed
promises have been given (Ngelsbach). This is clear from the reasons
given in the question, in which the murder of the priests and prophets
in the sanctuary of the Lord is brought forward. But first there is
mentioned a case of inhuman conduct, prompted by necessity, viz., that
women, in the extreme destitution of hunger, have been constrained to
eat the fruit of their body, their beloved children. אם...אם does not,
in this case, introduce a disjunctive question, but merely an indirect
question in two parts. In view of such inhuman cruelties and such
desecration of His sanctuary, God cannot remain inactive. The meaning of
the question is not: estne hoc unquam fando auditum, quod apud nos
factum est, or, quod matres fame eo adactae fuerint, ut suos faetus
comederent (C. B. Michaelis, Rosenmller). For in this case, not the
imperfect, but the perfect, would be used. It is merely asked whether
something could happen in a certain way, while it is implied that it has
actually occurred already. פּרים has the masc. instead of the fem.
suffix, as pretty frequently happens. The fruit of their bodies is
meant, as the lxx have rightly rendered; but there is no reason for
making this the ground of alterations in the text. The expression "their
fruit," indefinite in itself, is immediately rendered definite by עללי
טפּחים. The last word is a verbal noun from טפּח ([Lam
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022).md), which again is a denominative
from טפח, and means to bear on the hands, to care for tenderly. Both
words occur only in this passage. The Israelites, moreover, had been
threatened with this inhuman outrage as the most extreme form of divine
chastisement, [Lev 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md); [Deu
28:56](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056.md); cf. [Jer
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009.md). While this abomination is
opposed to the moral order of the world instituted by God, the other
case (the murder of the priests and prophets in the sanctuary) is a
violation of the covenant-order which the Lord had given His people.
Neither of these arrangements can God consent to abolish. Therein is
implicitly contained the request that He would put an end to the misery
into which His people have fallen. This request, however, is not
expressly stated; there is merely complaint made to God regarding the
terrible misery. From the massacre in the temple, the lamentation passes
to the bloodshed on the streets of the city, in which neither age nor
sex was spared; cf. [Jer 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011.md). חוּצות
is a local accus., "through the streets," along the streets.

[Lamentations 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 2:22</span></span>

The imperf. תּקרא has perhaps bee chosen merely for the sake of the
alphabetic arrangement, because the description is still continued, and
the idea of custom (wont) or repetition is not very suitable in the
present instance. "Thou summonest, as for a feast-day (viz., for the
enemy, cf. [Lam 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015).md), all my terrors
round about." מגוּרי מסּביב is to be explained in conformity with the
formula מגור מסּביב, so frequent in Jeremiah ([Jer
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025.md); [Jer
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004.md), [Jer
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010), etc..md): מגוּרי is therefore to
be derived from מגור, but not to be confined in its reference to the
enemy (as in the Vulgate, qui terrent); it is rather to be understood as
applying to all the terrible powers that had come upon Judah, - sword,
famine, plagues (cf. [Lam 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020).md). On
the ground that מגוּרים elsewhere means wandering, pilgrimage, and that,
moreover, the sing. מגור in [Psa 55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016.md)
signifies a dwelling, Ewald translates the expression in the text, "my
hamlets round about," understanding by that the inhabitants of the
defenceless country towns and villages, which stand to the capital that
gave them its protection in the relation of settlers in its
neighbourhood (lxx πάροικοι). According to this view, the verse alludes
to an important event which took place in those days of the siege, when
all the inhabitants of the country towns fled to the capital, thinking
that a great festival was going to be held there, as on former
occasions; but this became at last for them the great festival of death,
when the city was taken. But the translation of the lxx is of no
authority, since they have given a false rendering of מגור מסּביב also;
and the whole explanation is so artificial and unnatural, that it needs
no further refutation. Raschi, indeed, had previously explained מגוּרי
to mean שכיני, vicinos meos, but added improbos, ut sese congregarent
adversus me ad perdendum. Notwithstanding this, מגוּרים, "wandering" and
"place of sojourn," cannot denote the country towns as distinguished
from the capital; nor can the flight of the inhabitants of the low-lying
regions into the capital be fitly called a summoning together of them by
the Lord. The combination פּליט ושׂריד is used as in [Jer
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#017.md); [Jer
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014.md). For טפּח, see on [Lam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md). With the complaint that no one
could escape the judgment, - that the enemy dared to murder even the
children whom she Jerusalem had carefully nourished and brought up, -
the poem concludes, like the first, with deep sorrow, regarding which
all attempts at comfort are quite unavailing (Gerlach).
