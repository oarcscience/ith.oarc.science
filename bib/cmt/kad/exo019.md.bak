### [Exodus Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 19:1</span></span>

In the third month after their departure from Egypt, the Israelites
arrived at Sinai, proceeding from Rephidim into the desert of Sinai, and
encamping there before the mountain. On what day of the month, the
received text does not state. The striking expression הזּה בּיּום ("the
same day"), without any previous notice of the day, cannot signify the
first day of the month; nor can השּׁלישׁי החדשׁ signify the third new
moon in the year, and be understood as referring to the first day of the
third month. For although, according to the etymology of חדשׁ (from חדשׁ
to be new), it might denote the new moon, yet in chronological data it
is never used in this sense; but the day of the month is invariably
appended after the month itself has been given (e.g., לחדשׁ אחד [Exo
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002.md), [Exo
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017.md); [Gen
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#005.md), [Gen
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#013.md); [Num
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md); [Num
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md); [Num
33:38](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#038), etc..md). Moreover, in the
Pentateuch the word חדשׁ never signifies new moon; but the new moons are
called חדשׁים ראשׁי ([Num 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010.md); [Num
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md), cf. Hengstenberg,
Dissertations, vol. ii. 297). And even in such passages as [Sa1
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#005.md); [Sa1
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#024.md); [Kg2
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023.md); [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md); [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013.md), etc., where חדשׁ is mentioned as
a feast along with the Sabbaths and other feasts, the meaning new moon
appears neither demonstrable nor necessary, as חדשׁ in this case denotes
the feast of the month, the celebration of the beginning of the month.
If, therefore, the text is genuine, and the date of the month has not
dropt out (and the agreement of the ancient versions with the Masoretic
text favours this conclusion), there is no other course open, than to
understand יום, as in [Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md) and
[Num 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md), and probably also in the
unusual expression החדשׁ יום, [Exo
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002.md), in the general sense of time; so
that here, and also in [Num 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001.md); [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md), the month only is given, and not
the day of the month, and it is altogether uncertain whether the arrival
in the desert of Sinai took place on one of the first, one of the
middle, or one of the last days of the month. The Jewish tradition,
which assigns the giving of the law to the fiftieth day after the
Passover, is of far too recent a date to pass for historical (see my
Archologie, 83, 6).

The desert of Sinai is not the plain of er Rahah to the north of Horeb,
but the desert in front (נגד) of the mountain, upon the summit of which
Jehovah came down, whilst Moses ascended it to receive the law ([Exo
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#020.md) and [Exo
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#002).md). This mountain is constantly
called Sinai so long as Israel stayed there ([Exo
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018.md), [Exo
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#020.md), [Exo
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#023.md), [Exo
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#016.md); [Exo
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#002.md), [Exo
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#004.md), [Exo
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029.md), [Exo
34:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#032.md); [Lev
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#038.md); [Lev
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#001.md); [Lev
26:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046.md); [Lev
27:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#034.md); [Num
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md); see also [Num
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#006.md) and [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002).md); and the place of their
encampment by the mountain is also called the "desert of Sinai," never
the desert of Horeb ([Lev 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#038.md); [Num
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md), [Num
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#019.md); [Num
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014.md); [Num
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001.md); [Num
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012.md); [Num
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064.md); [Num
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#015).md). But in [Exo
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#006.md) this spot is designated as "Mount
Horeb," and in Deuteronomy, as a rule, it is spoken of briefly as
"Horeb" ([Deu 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#002.md), [Deu
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#006.md), [Deu
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019.md); [Deu
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010.md), [Deu
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015.md); [Deu
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#002.md); [Deu
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#008.md); [Deu
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#016.md); [Deu
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001).md). And whilst the general identity
of Sinai and Horeb may be inferred from this; the fact, that wherever
the intention of the writer is to give a precise and geographical
description of the place where the law was given, the name Sinai is
employed, leads to the conclusion that the term Horeb was more general
and comprehensive than that of Sinai; in other words, that Horeb was the
range of which Sinai was one particular mountain, which only came
prominently out to view when Israel had arrived at the mount of
legislation. This distinction between the two names, which Hengstenberg
was the first to point out and establish (in his Dissertations, vol. ii.
p. 325), is now generally admitted; so that the only room that is left
for any difference of opinion is with reference to the extent of the
Horeb range. There is no ground for supposing that the name Horeb
includes the whole of the mountains in the Arabian peninsula. Sufficient
justice is done to all the statements in the Bible, if we restrict this
name to the southern and highest range of the central mountains-to the
exclusion, therefore, of the Serbal group.

(Note: This hypothesis advocated by Lepsius, that Sinai or Horeb is to
be sought for in Serbal, has very properly met with no favour. For the
objections to this, see Ritter, Erdkunde 14, pp. 738ff.; and Kurtz,
History of O.C., vol. iii. p. 94ff.)

This southern range, which Arabian geographers and the Bedouins call
Jebel Tur or Jebel Tur Sina, consists of three summits: (1) a central
one, called by the Arabs Jebel Musa (Moses' Mountain), and by Christians
either Horeb or else Horeb-Sinai, in which case the northern and lower
peak, or Ras es Sufsafeh, is called Horeb, and the southern and loftier
one Sinai; (2) a western one, called Jebel Humr, with Mount Catherine on
the south, the loftiest point in the whole range; and (3) an eastern
one, called Jebel el Deir (Convent Mountain) or Episteme (vide Ritter,
14, pp. 527ff.). - Near this range there are two plains, which furnish
space enough for a large encampment. One of these is the plain of er
Rahah, on the north and north-west of Horeb-Sinai, with a level space of
an English square mile, which is considerably enlarged by the Sheikh
valley that opens into it from the east. At its southern extremity
Horeb, with its granite rocks, runs almost precipitously to the height
of 1200 or 1500 feet; and towards the west it is also shut in as with a
wall by the equally precipitous spurs of Jebel Humr. The other plain,
which is called Sebayeh, lies to the south-east of Sinai, or Jebel Musa
in the more restricted sense; it is from 1400 to 1800 feet broad, 12,000
feet long, and is shut in towards the south and east by mountains, which
rise very gently, and do not reach any considerable height. There are
three wadys leading to this plain from er Rahah and the Sheikh valley.
The most westerly of these, which separates Horeb-Sinai from Jebel Humr
with Mount Catherine on the south, is called el Leja, and is a narrow
defile full of great blocks of stone, and shut in towards the south like
a cul de sac by Mount Catherine. The central one, which separates Horeb
from Jebel Deir, is Wady Shoeib (Jethro valley), with the convent of
Sinai in it, which is also called the Convent Valley in consequence.
This is less confined, and not so much strewed with stones; towards the
south it is not quite shut in, and yet not quite open, but bounded by a
steep pass and a grassy mountain-saddle, viz., the easily accessible
Jebel Sebayeh. The third and most easterly is the Wady es Sebayeh, which
is from 400 to 600 feet broad, and leads form the Sheikh valley, in a
southern and south-westerly direction, to the plain of the same name,
which stretches like an amphitheatre to the southern slope of Sinai, or
Jebel Musa, in the more restricted sense. When seen from this plain,
"Jebel Musa has the appearance of a lofty and splendid mountain cone,
towering far above the lower gravelly hills by which it is surrounded"
(Ritter, pp. 540, 541).

Since Robinson, who was the first to describe the plain of er Rahah, and
its fitness for the encampment of Israel, visited Sinai, this plain has
generally been regarded as the site where Israel encamped in the "desert
of Sinai." Robinson supposed that he had discovered the Sinai of the
Bible in the northern peak of Mount Horeb, viz., Ras es Sufsafeh. But
Ritter, Kurtz, and others have followed Laborde and Fa. A. Strauss, who
were the first to point out the suitableness of the plain of Sebayeh to
receive a great number of people, in fixing upon Jebel Musa in the
stricter sense, the southern peak of the central group, which tradition
had already indicated as the scene of the giving of the law, as the true
Mount Sinai, where Moses received the laws from God, and the plain of
Sebayeh as the spot to which Moses led the people (i.e., the men) on the
third day, out of the camp of God and through the Sebayeh valley ([Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016).md). For this plain is far better
adapted to be the scene of such a display of the nation, than the plain
of er Rahah: first, because the hills in the background slope gradually
upwards in the form of an amphitheatre, and could therefore hold a
larger number of people;

(Note: "Sinai falls towards the south for about 2000 feet into low
granite hills, and then into a large plain, which is about 1600 feet
broad and nearly five miles long, and rises like an amphitheatre
opposite to the mountain both on the south and east. It is a plain that
seems made to accommodate a large number gathered round the foot of the
mountain" (Strauss, p. 135).)

whereas the mountains which surround the plain of er Rahah are so steep
and rugged, that they could not be made use of in arranging the people:
- and secondly, because the gradual sloping of the plain upwards, both
on the east and south, would enable even the furthest rows to see Mount
Sinai in all its majestic grandeur; whereas the plain of er Rahah slopes
downwards towards the north, so that persons standing in the background
would be completely prevented by those in front from seeing Ras es
Sufsafeh. - If, however, the plain of es Sebayeh so entirely answers to
all the topographical data of the Bible, that we must undoubtedly regard
it as the spot where the people of God were led up to the foot of the
mountain, we cannot possibly fix upon the plain of er Rahah as the place
of encampment in the desert of Sinai. The very expression "desert of
Sinai," which is applied to the place of encampment, is hardly
reconcilable with this opinion. For example, if the Sinai of the Old
Testament is identical with the present Jebel Musa, and the whole group
of mountains bore the name of Horeb, the plain of er Rahah could not
with propriety be called the desert of Sinai, for Sinai cannot even be
seen from it, but is completely hidden by the Ras es Sufsafeh of Horeb.
Moreover, the road from the plain of er Rahah into the plain of es
Sebayeh through the Sebayeh valley is so long and so narrow, that the
people of Israel, who numbered more than 600,000 men, could not possibly
have been conducted from the camp in er Rahah into the Sebayeh plain,
and so up to Mount Sinai, and then, after being placed in order there,
and listening to the promulgation of the law, have returned to the camp
again, all in a single day. The Sebayeh valley, or the road from the
Sheikh valley to the commencement of the plain of Sebayeh, is, it is
true, only an hour long. But we have to add to this the distance from
the point at which the Sebayeh valley opens into the Sheikh valley to
the western end of the plain of er Rahah, viz., two hours' journey, and
the length of the plain of Sebayeh itself, which is more than five miles
long; so that the Israelites, at least those who were encamped in the
western part of the plain of er Rahah, would have to travel four or five
hours before they could be posted at the foot of Sinai.

(Note: Some Englishmen who accompanied F. A. Strauss "had taken
three-quarters of an hour for a fast walk from the Sebayeh plain to Wady
es Sheikh;" so that it is not too much to reckon an hour for ordinary
walking. Dbel tool quite six hours to go round Horeb-Sinai, which is
only a little larger than Jebel Deir; so that at least three hours must
be reckoned as necessary to accomplish the walk from the eastern end of
the plain of er Rahah through the Wady Sebayeh to the foot of Sinai. And
Robinson took fifty minutes to go with camels from the commencement of
the Sheikh valley, at the end of the Convent Valley, to the point at
which it is joined by the valley of Sebayeh (Palestine i. p. 215).)

Tischendorf calls this a narrow, bad road, which the Israelites were
obliged to pass through to Sinai, when they came out of the Sheikh
valley. At any rate, this is true of the southern end of the valley of
Sebayeh, from the point at which it enters the plain of Sebayeh, where
we can hardly picture it to ourselves as broad enough for two hundred
men to walk abreast in an orderly procession through the valley;

(Note: We are still in want of exact information from travellers as to
the breadth of the southern end of the valley of Sebayeh. Ritter merely
states, on the ground of MS notes in Strauss' diary, that "at first it
is somewhat contracted on account of projections in the heights by which
it is bounded towards the south, but it still remains more than 500 feet
broad." And "when it turns towards the north-west, the wady is
considerably widened; so that at the narrowest points it is more than
600 feet broad. And very frequently, at the different curves in the
valley, large basins are formed, which would hold a considerable number
of people.")

consequently, 600,000 men would have required two hours' time simply to
pass through the narrow southern end of the valley of Sebayeh. Now, it
is clear enough from the narrative itself that Moses did not take merely
the elders, as the representatives of the nation, from the camp to the
mountain to meet with God ([Exo
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#017).md), but took the whole nation,
that is to say, all the adult males of 20 years old and upwards; and
this is especially evident from the command so emphatically and
repeatedly given, that no one was to break through the hedge placed
round the mountain. It may also be inferred from the design of the
revelation itself, which was intended to make the deepest impression
upon the whole nation of that majesty of Jehovah and the holiness of His
law.

Under these circumstances, if the people had been encamped in the plain
of er Rahah and the Sheikh valley, they could not have been conducted to
the foot of Sinai and stationed in the plain of Sebayeh in the course of
six hours, and then, after hearing the revelation of the law, have
returned to their tents on the same day; even assuming, as Kurtz does
(iii. p. 117), that "the people were overpowered by the majesty of the
promulgation of the law, and fled away in panic;" for flight through so
narrow a valley would have caused inevitable confusion, and therefore
would have prevented rather than facilitated rapidity of movement. There
is not a word, however, in the original text about a panic, or about the
people flying (see [Exo 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018).md): it is
merely stated, that as soon as the people witnessed the alarming
phenomena connected with the descent of God upon the mountain, they
trembled in the camp ([Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016).md), and
that when they were conducted to the foot of the mountain, and "saw the
thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the
mountain smoking," and heard the solemn promulgation of the decalogue,
they trembled (ינעוּ, [Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016).md), and
said to Moses, through their elders and the heads of tribes, that they
did not wish God to speak directly to them any more, but wished Moses to
speak to God and listen to His words; whereupon, after God had expressed
His approval of these words of the people, Moses directed the people to
return to their tents ([Exo 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018.md).;
[Deu 5:23-30](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#023).md). If, again, we take into
consideration, that after Moses had stationed the people at the foot of
the mountain, he went up to God to the summit of Sinai, and came down
again at the command of God to repeat the charge to the people, not to
break through the hedge round the mountain ([Exo
19:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#020).md), and it was not till after
this, that God proclaimed the decalogue, and that this going up and down
must also have taken up time, it cannot have been for so very short a
time that the people continued standing round the bottom of the
mountain. But if all these difficulties be regarded as trivial, and we
include the evening and part of the night in order to afford time for
the people to return to their tents; not only is there nothing in the
biblical text to require the hypothesis which assigns the encampment to
the plain of er Rahah, and the posting of the people at Sinai to the
plain of Sebayeh, but there are various allusions which seem rather to
show that such a hypothesis is inadmissible. It is very obvious from
[Exo 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#017.md), that the glory of the Lord
upon the top of the mountain could be seen from the camp; and from [Exo
34:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001.md), that the camp, with both the
people and their cattle in it, was so immediately in the neighbourhood
of Sinai, that the people could easily have ascended the mountain, and
the cattle could have grazed upon it. Now this does not apply in the
least to the plain of er Rahah, from which not even the top of Jebel
Musa can be seen, and where the cattle could not possibly have grazed
upon it, but only to the plain of Sebayeh; and therefore proves that the
camp in "the desert of Sinai" is not to be sought for in the plain of er
Rahah, but in the plain of Sebayeh, which reaches to the foot of Sinai.
If it should be objected, on the other hand, that there is not room in
this plain for the camp of the whole nation, this objection is quite as
applicable to the plain of er Rahah, which is not large enough in itself
to take in the entire camp, without including a large portion of the
Sheikh valley; and it loses all its force from the fact, that the
mountains by which the plain of Sebayeh is bounded, both on the south
and east, rise so gently and gradually, that they could be made use of
for the camp, and on these sides therefore the space is altogether
unlimited, and would allow of the widest dispersion of the people and
their flocks.

[Exodus 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 19:3</span></span>

Moses had known from the time of his call that Israel would serve God on
this mountain ([Exo 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012).md); and as soon
as the people were encamped opposite to it, he went up to God, i.e., up
the mountain, to the top of which the cloud had probably withdrawn.
There God gave him the necessary instructions for preparing for the
covenant: first of all assuring him, that He had brought the Israelites
to Himself to make them His own nation, and that He would speak to them
from the mountain ([Exo 19:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004).md); and
then ordering him to sanctify the people for this revelation of the Lord
([Exo 19:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010).md). The promise precedes
the demand; for the grace of God always anticipates the wants of man,
and does not demand before it has given. Jehovah spoke to Moses "from
Mount Horeb." Moses had probably ascended one of the lower heights,
whilst Jehovah is to be regarded as on the summit of the mountain. The
words of God ([Exo 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004)..md) refer first
of all to what He had done for the Egyptians, and how He had borne the
Israelites on eagles' wings; manifesting in this way not only the
separation between Israel and the Egyptians, but the adoption of Israel
as the nation of His especial grace and favour. The "eagles' wings" are
figurative, and denote the strong and loving care of God. The eagle
watches over its young in the most careful manner, flying under them
when it leads them from the nest, least they should fall upon the rocks,
and be injured or destroyed (cf. [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md), and for proofs from profane
literature, Bochart, Hieroz, ii. pp. 762, 765ff.). "And brought you unto
Myself:" i.e., not "led you to the dwelling-place of God on Sinai," as
Knobel supposes; but took you into My protection and My especial care.

[Exodus 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 19:5</span></span>

This manifestation of the love of God to Israel formed only the prelude,
however, to that gracious union which Jehovah was now about to establish
between the Israelites and Himself. If they would hear His voice, and
keep the covenant which as about to be established with them, they
should be a costly possession to Him out of all nations (cf. [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md); [Deu
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002.md); [Deu
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#018).md). סגלּה does not signify
property in general, but valuable property, that which is laid by, or
put aside (סגל), hence a treasure of silver and gold ([Ch1
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003.md); [Ecc
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008).md). In the Sept. the expression is
rendered λαὸς περιούσιος, which the Scholiast in Octat. interprets
ἐξαίρετος, and in [Mal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017.md) εἰς
περιποίησιν: hence the two phrases in the New Testament, λαὸς περιούσιος
in [Tit 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md), and λαὸς εἰς περιποίησιν
in [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md). Jehovah had chosen Israel
as His costly possession out of all the nations of the earth, because
the whole earth was His possession, and all nations belonged to Him as
Creator and Preserver. The reason thus assigned for the selection of
Israel precludes at the very outset the exclusiveness which would regard
Jehovah as merely a national deity. The idea of the segullah is
explained in [Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md) : "Ye shall be
unto Me a kingdom of priests." ממלכה signifies both kingship, as the
embodiment of royal supremacy, exaltation, and dignity, and the kingdom,
or the union of both king and subjects, i.e., the land and nation,
together with its king. In the passage before us, the word has been
understood by most of the early commentators, both Jewish and Christian,
and also in the ancient versions,

(Note: lxx: βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα, a royal priesthood, i.e., a priestly
nation of royal power and glory. כּהנין מלכין: Kings-priests (Onkelos).
- "Eritis coram me reges coronati (כלילא קטירי vincti coronis) et
sacerdotes ministrantes" (Jonathan). - "Eritis meo nomini reges et
sacerdotes" (Jer. Targ.).)

in the first or active sense, so that the expression contains the idea,
"Ye shall be all priests and kings" (Luther); praeditos fore tam
sacerdotali quam regio honore (Calvin); quod reges et sacerdotes sunt in
republica, id vos eritis mihi (Drusius). This explanation is required by
both the passage itself and the context. For apart from the fact that
kingship is the primary and most general meaning of the word ממלכה (cf.
דּוד ממלכת, the kingship, or government of David), the other (passive)
meaning would not be at all suitable here; for a kingdom of priests
could never denote the fellowship existing in a kingdom between the king
and the priests, but only a kingdom or commonwealth consisting of
priests, i.e., a kingdom the members and citizens of which were priests,
and as priests constituted the ממלכה, in other words, were possessed of
royal dignity and power; for ממלכה, βασιλεία, always includes the idea
of מלך or ruling (βασιλεύειν). The lxx have quite hit the meaning in
their rendering: βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα. Israel was to be a regal body of
priests to Jehovah, and not merely a nation of priests governed by
Jehovah. The idea of the theocracy, or government of God, as founded by
the establishment of the Sinaitic covenant institution in Israel, is not
at all involved in the term "kingdom of priests." The theocracy
established by the conclusion of the covenant (Exo 24) was only the
means adopted by Jehovah for making His chosen people a royal body of
priests; and the maintenance of this covenant was the indispensable
subjective condition, upon which their attainment of this divinely
appointed destiny and glory depended. This promise of Jehovah expressed
the design of the call of Israel, to which it was to be fully conducted
by the covenant institution of the theocracy, if it maintained the
covenant with Jehovah. The object of Israel's kingship and priesthood
was to be found in the nations of the earth, out of which Jehovah had
chosen Israel as a costly possession. This great and glorious promise,
the fulfilment of which could not be attained till the completion of the
kingdom of God, when the Israel of God, the Church of the Lord, which
Jesus Christ, the first-begotten from the dead, and prince (ἄρχων,
ruler) of the kings of the earth, has made a "kingdom," "priests unto
God and His Father" ([Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md) and [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md), where the reading should be
βασιλεῖς καὶ ἱερεῖς), is exalted to glory with Christ as the first-born
among many brethren, and sits upon His throne and reigns, has not been
introduced abruptly here. On the contrary, the way was already prepared
by the promises made to the patriarchs, of the blessing which Abraham
would become to all the nations of the earth, and of the kings who were
to spring from him and come out of the loins of Israel ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md); [Gen
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#006.md); [Gen
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#011).md), and still more distinctly by
Jacob's prophecy of the sceptre of Judah, to whom, through Shiloh, the
willing submission of the nations should be made ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md). But these promises and
prophecies are outshone by the clearness, with which kingship and
priesthood over and for the nations are foretold of Israel here.

This kingship, however, is not merely of a spiritual kind, consisting,
as Luther supposes, in the fact, that believers "are lords over death,
the devil, hell, and all evil," but culminates in the universal sway
foretold by Balaam in [Num 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md) and
[Num 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md)., by Moses in his last
words ([Deu 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029).md), and still more
distinctly in [Dan 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027.md), to the people
of the saints of the Most High, as the ultimate end of their calling
from God. The spiritual attitude of Israel towards the nations was the
result of its priestly character. As the priest is a mediator between
God and man, so Israel was called to be the vehicle of the knowledge and
salvation of God to the nations of the earth. By this it unquestionably
acquired an intellectual and spiritual character; but this includes,
rather than excludes, the government of the world. For spiritual and
intellectual supremacy and rule must eventually ensure the government of
the world, as certainly as spirit is the power that overcomes the world.
And if the priesthood of Israel was the power which laid the foundation
for its kingship, - in other words, if Israel obtained the ממלכה or
government over the nations solely as a priestly nation, - the Apostle
Peter, when taking up this promise ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md), might without hesitation follow
the Septuagint rendering (βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα), and substitute in the
place of the "priestly kingdom," a "royal priesthood;" for there is no
essential difference between the two, the kingship being founded upon
the priesthood, and the priesthood completed by the kingship.

As a kingdom of priests, it was also necessary that Israel should be a
"holy nation." Gens sancta hic dicitur non respectu pietatis vel
sanctimoniae, sed quam Deus singulari privilegio ab aliis separavit.
Verum ab hac sanctificatione pendet altera, nempe ut sanctitatem colant,
qui Dei gratia eximii sunt, atque ita vicissim Deum sanctificent
(Calvin). This explanation is in general a correct one; for these words
indicate the dignity to which Israel was to be elevated by Jehovah, the
Holy One, through its separation from the nations of the earth. But it
cannot be shown that קדושׁ ever means "separated." Whether we suppose it
to be related to חדשׁ, and חדשׁ the newly shining moonlight, or compare
it with the Sanskrit dhûsch, to be splendid, or beautiful, in either
case the primary meaning of the word is, "to be splendid, pure,
untarnished." Diestel has correctly observed, that the holiness of God
and Israel is most closely connected with the covenant relationship; but
he is wrong in the conclusion which lie draws from this, namely, that
"holy" was originally only a "relative term," and that a thing was holy
"so far as it was the property of God." For the whole earth is Jehovah's
property ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005).md), but it is not
holy on that account. Jehovah is not holy only "so far as within the
covenant He is both possession and possessor, absolute life and the
source of life, and above all, both the chief good and the chief model
for His people" (Diestel), or "as the truly separate One, enclosed
within Himself, who is self-existent, in contrast with the world to
which He does not belong" (Hoffmann); but holiness pertains to God
alone, and to those who participate in the divine holiness-not, however,
to God as the Creator and Preserver of the world, but to God as the
Redeemer of man. Light is the earthly reflection of His holy nature: the
Holy One of Israel is the light of Israel ([Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017.md), cf. [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016).md). The light, with its purity and
splendour, is the most suitable earthly element to represent the
brilliant and spotless purity of the Holy One, in whom there is no
interchange of light and darkness ([Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017).md). God is called the Holy One,
because He is altogether pure, the clear and spotless light; so that in
the idea of the holiness of God there are embodied the absolute moral
purity and perfection of the divine nature, and His unclouded glory.
Holiness and glory are inseparable attributes in God; but in His
relation to the world they are so far distinguished, that the whole
earth is full of His glory, whilst it is to and in Israel that His
holiness is displayed ([Isa 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003).md); in
other words, the glory of God is manifested in the creation and
preservation of the world, and His holy name in the election and
guidance of Israel (compare Ps 104 with Ps 103). God has displayed the
glory of His name in the creation of the heavens and the earth ([Psa
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001).md); but His way in Israel ([Psa
77:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#014).md), i.e., the work of God in His
kingdom of grace, is holy; so that it might be said, that the glory of
God which streams forth in the material creation is manifested as
holiness in His saving work for a sinful world, to rescue it from the
φθορά of sin and death and restore it to the glory of eternal life, and
that it was manifested here in the fact, that by the counsels of His own
spontaneous love ([Deu 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037).md) He chose
Israel as His possession, to make of it a holy nation, if it hearkened
to His voice and kept His covenant. It was not made this, however, by
being separated from the other nations, for that was merely the means of
attaining the divine end, but by the fact, that God placed the chosen
people in the relation of covenant fellowship with Himself, founded His
kingdom in Israel, established in the covenant relationship an
institution of salvation, which furnished the covenant people with the
means of obtaining the expiation of their sins, and securing
righteousness before God and holiness of life with God, in order that by
the discipline of His holy commandments, under the guidance of His holy
arm, He might train and guide them to the holiness and glory of the
divine life. But as sin opposes holiness, and the sinner resists
sanctification, the work of the holiness of God reveals itself in His
kingdom of grace, not only positively in the sanctification of those who
suffer themselves to be sanctified and raised to newness of life, but
negatively also, in the destruction of all those who obstinately refuse
the guidance of His grace; so that the glory of the thrice Holy One
([Isa 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003).md) will be fully manifested
both in the glorification of His chosen people and the deliverance of
the whole creation from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
liberty of the children of God ([Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021).md), and also in the destruction of
hardened sinners, the annihilation of everything that is ungodly in this
world, the final overthrow of Satan and his kingdom, and the founding of
the new heaven and new earth. Hence not only is every person, whom God
receives into the sphere of His sin-destroying grace, קדושׁ, or holy;
but everything which is applied to the realization of the divine work of
salvation, or consecrated by God to this object. The opposite of קדושׁ,
holy, is הל, κοινός, profanus (from חלל, to be loose, lit., the
unbound), not devoted to holy purposes and uses (cf. [Lev
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010).md); and this term was applied, not
only to what was sinful and unclean (טמא), but to everything earthly in
its natural condition, because the whole earth, with all that is upon
it, has been involved in the consequences of sin.

[Exodus 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 19:7</span></span>

When Moses communicated to the people through their elders this
incomparable promise of the Lord, they promised unanimously (יחדּו) to
do all that Jehovah said; and when Moses reported to the Lord what the
people had answered, He said to Moses, "I will come to thee in the
darkness of the cloud, that the people may listen to My speaking to thee
(בּ שׁמע, as in [Gen 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#005), etc..md), and
also believe thee for ever." As God knew the weakness of the sinful
nation, and could not, as the Holy One, come into direct intercourse
with it on account of its unholiness, but was about to conclude the
covenant with it through the mediation of Moses, it was necessary, in
order to accomplish the design of God, that the chosen mediator should
receive special credentials; and these were to consists in the fact that
Jehovah spoke to Moses in the sight and hearing of the people, that is
to say, that He solemnly proclaimed the fundamental law of the covenant
in the presence of the whole nation (Ex 19:16-20:18), and showed by this
fact that Moses was the recipient and mediator of the revelation of God,
in order that the people might believe him "for ever," as the law was to
possess everlasting validity ([Mat
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018).md).

[Exodus 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 19:10</span></span>

God then commanded Moses to prepare the people for His appearing or
speaking to them: (1) by their sanctification, through the washing of
the body and clothes (see [Gen 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002).md),
and abstinence from conjugal intercourse ([Exo
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#015).md) on account of the defilement
connected therewith ([Lev 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#018).md); and
(2) by setting bounds round the people, that they might not ascend or
touch the mountain. The hedging or bounding (הגבּיל) of the people is
spoken of in [Exo 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#023.md) as setting
bounds about the mountain, and consisted therefore in the erection of a
barrier round the mountain, which was to prevent the people form
ascending or touching it. Any one who touched it (קצהוּ, "its end,"
i.e., the outermost or lowest part of the mountain) was to be put to
death, whether man or beast. "No hand shall touch him" (the individual
who passed the barrier and touched the mountain), i.e., no one was to
follow him within the appointed boundaries, but he was to be killed from
a distance either by stones or darts. (יּיּרה for יוּרה, see Gesenius,
69.) Not till "the drawing out of the trumpet blast," or, as Luther
renders it, "only when it sounded long," could they ascend the mountain
([Exo 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013).md). היּבל, from יבל to
stream violently with noise, is synonymous with היּבל קרן ([Jos
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005).md), and was really the same thing as
the שׁופר, i.e., a long wind instrument shaped like a horn. היּבל משׁך
is to draw the horn, i.e., to blow the horn with tones long drawn out.
This was done either to give a signal to summon the people to war ([Jdg
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#027.md); [Jdg
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034).md), or to call them to battle ([Jdg
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#018.md); [Job
39:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#024), etc..md), or for other public
proclamations. No one (this is the idea) was to ascend the mountain on
pain of death, or even to touch its outermost edge; but when the horn
was blown with a long blast, and the signal to approach was given
thereby, then they might ascend it (see [Exo
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#021).md), - of course not 600,000 men,
which would have been physically impossible, but the people in the
persons of their representatives the elders. בּהר עלות signifies to go
up the mountain in [Exo 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013.md) as well
as in [Exo 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#012.md), and not merely to
come to the foot of the mountain (see [Deu
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#005).md).

[Exodus 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 19:16</span></span>

After these preparations, on the morning of the third day (from the
issuing of this divine command), Jehovah came down upon the top of Mount
Sinai ([Exo 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#020).md), manifesting His
glory in fire as the mighty, jealous God, in the midst of thunders (קלת)
and lightnings, so that the mountain burned with fire ([Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011.md); [Deu
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#020).md), and the smoke of the burning
mountain ascended as the smoke (עשׁן for עשׁן), and the whole mountain
trembled ([Exo 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018).md), at the same
time veiling in a thick cloud the fire of His wrath and jealousy, by
which the unholy are consumed. Thunder and lightning bursting forth from
the thick cloud, and fire with smoke, were the elementary substrata,
which rendered the glory of the divine nature visible to men, though in
such a way that the eye of mortals beheld no form of the spiritual and
invisible Deity. These natural phenomena were accompanied by a loud
trumpet blast, which "blew long and waxed louder and louder" ([Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md) and [Exo
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#019.md); see [Gen
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#003).md), and was, as it were, the
herald's call, announcing to the people the appearance of the Lord, and
summoning them to assemble before Him and listen to His words, as they
sounded forth from the fire and cloudy darkness. The blast (קול) of the
shophar ([Exo 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#019).md), i.e., the
σάλπιγξ Θεοῦ, the trump of God, such a trumpet as is used in the service
of God (in heaven, [Th1 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md); see
Winer's Grammar), is not "the voice of Jehovah," but a sound resembling
a trumpet blast. Whether this sound was produced by natural means, or,
as some of the earlier commentators supposed, by angels, of whom myriads
surrounded Jehovah when He came down upon Sinai ([Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002).md), it is impossible to decide. At
this alarming phenomenon, "all the people that was in the camp trembled"
([Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016).md). For according to [Exo
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#020) (17.md), it was intended to inspire
them with a salutary fear of the majesty of God. Then Moses conducted
the people (i.e., the men) out of the camp of God, and stationed them at
the foot of the mountain outside the barrier ([Exo
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#017).md); and "Moses spake" ([Exo
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#019).md), i.e., asked the Lord for His
commands, "and God answered loud" (בּקול), and told him to come up to
the top of the mountain. He then commanded him to go down again, and
impress upon the people that no one was to break through to Jehovah to
see, i.e., to break down the barriers that were erected around the
mountain as the sacred place of God, and attempt to penetrate into the
presence of Jehovah. Even the priests, who were allowed to approach God
by virtue of their office, were to sanctify themselves, that Jehovah
might not break forth upon them (יפרץ), i.e., dash them to pieces. (On
the form העדתה for העידת, see Ewald, 199 a). The priests were neither
"the sons of Aaron," i.e., Levitical priest, nor the first-born or
principes populi, but "those who had hitherto discharged the duties of
the priestly office according to natural right and custom" (Baumgarten).
Even these priests were too unholy to be able to come into the presence
of the holy God. This repeated enforcement of the command not to touch
the mountain, and the special extension of it even to the priests, were
intended to awaken in the people a consciousness of their own unholiness
quite as much as of the unapproachable holiness of Jehovah. But this
separation from God, which arose from the unholiness of the nation, did
not extend to Moses and Aaron, who were to act as mediators, and were
permitted to ascend the mountain. Moreover, the prospect of ascending
the holy mountain "at the drawing of the blast" was still before the
people ([Exo 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013).md). And the strict
prohibition against breaking through the barrier, to come of their own
accord into the presence of Jehovah, is by no means at variance with
this. When God gave the sign to ascend the mountain, the people might
and were to draw near to Him. This sign, viz., the long-drawn trumpet
blast, was not to be given in any case till after the promulgation of
the ten words of the fundamental law. But it was not given even after
this promulgation; not, however, because "the development was altogether
an abnormal one, and not in accordance with the divine appointment in
[Exo 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013.md), inasmuch as at the
thunder, the lightning, and the sound of the trumpet, with which the
giving of the law was concluded, they lost all courage, and instead of
waiting for the promised signal, were overcome with fear, and ran from
the spot," for there is not a word in the text about running away; but
because the people were so terrified by the alarming phenomena which
accompanied the coming down of Jehovah upon the mountain, that they gave
up the right of speaking with God, and from a fear of death entreated
Moses to undertake the intercourse with God in their behalf ([Exo
20:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018).md). Moreover, we cannot speak
of an "abnormal development" of the drama, for the simple reason, that
God not only foresaw the course and issue of the affair, but at the very
outset only promised that He would come to Moses in a thick cloud ([Exo
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009).md), and merely announced and
carried out His own descent upon Mount Sinai before the eyes of the
people in the terrible glory of His sacred majesty ([Exo
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#011).md), for the purpose of proving the
people, that His fear might be before their eyes ([Exo
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#020.md); cf. [Deu
5:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#028).md). Consequently, apart from the
physical impossibility of 600,000 ascending the mountain, it never was
intended that all the people should do so.

(Note: The idea of the people fleeing and running away must have been
got by Kurtz from either Luther's or De Wette's translation. They have
both of them rendered וגו ויּנעוּ, "they fled and went far off," instead
of "they trembled and stood far off." And not only the supposed flight,
but his idea that "thunder, lightning, and the trumpet blast (which were
silent in any case during the utterance of the ten commandments),
concluded the promulgation of the law, as they had already introduced it
according to [Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md)," also rests
upon a misunderstanding of the text of the Bible. There is not a
syllable in [Exo 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018.md) about the
thunder, lightning, and trumpet blast bursting forth afresh after the
proclamation of the ten commandments. There is simply an account of the
impression, which the alarming phenomena, mentioned in [Exo
19:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md) as attending the descent of
Jehovah upon the mountain ([Exo
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#020).md), and preceding His speaking to
Moses and the people, made upon the people, who had been brought out of
the camp to meet with God.)

What God really intended, came to pass. After the people had been
received into fellowship with Jehovah through the atoning blood of the
sacrifice, they were permitted to ascend the mountain in the persons of
their representatives, and there to see God ([Exo
24:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009).md).
