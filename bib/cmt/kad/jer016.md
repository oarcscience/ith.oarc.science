### [Jeremiah Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 16:0</span></span>

Jeremiah 16:1-17:4

The Course to be Pursued by the Prophet in Reference to the Approaching
Overthrow of the Kingdom of Judah. - The ruin of Jerusalem and of Judah
will inevitably come. This the prophet must proclaim by word and deed.
To this end he is shown in [Jer 16:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001)
what relation he is to maintain towards the people, now grown ripe for
judgment, and next in [Jer 16:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010) he
is told the cause of this terrible judgment; then comes an account of
its fulfilment ([Jer 16:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016)); then
again, finally, we have the cause of it explained once more ([Jer
17:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 16:1</span></span>

The course to be pursued by the prophet with reference to the
approaching judgment. - [Jer 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001).
"And the word of Jahveh cam to me, saying: [Jer
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#002). Thou shalt not take thee a wife,
neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. [Jer
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#003). For thus hath Jahveh said
concerning the sons and the daughters that are born in this place, and
concerning their mothers that bear them, and concerning their fathers
that beget them in this land: [Jer
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004). By deadly suffering shall they
die, be neither lamented or buried; dung upon the field shall they
become; and by sword and by famine shall they be consumed, and their
carcases shall be meat for the fowls of the heavens and the beasts of
the field. [Jer 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005). For thus hath
Jahveh said: Come not into the house of mourning, and go not to lament,
and bemoan them not; for I have taken away my peace from this people,
saith Jahveh, grace and mercies. [Jer
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006). And great and small shall die in
this land, not be buried; they shall not lament them, nor cut
themselves, nor make themselves bald for them. [Jer
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007). And they shall not break bread
for them in their mourning, to comfort one for the dead; nor shall they
give to any the cup of comfort for his father and his mother. [Jer
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#008). And into the house of feasting
go not, to sit by them, to eat and to drink. [Jer
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009). For thus hath spoken Jahveh of
hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I cause to cease out of this place
before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride."

What the prophet is here bidden to do and to forbear is closely bound up
with the proclamation enjoined on him of judgment to come on sinful
Judah. This connection is brought prominently forward in the reasons
given for these commands. He is neither to take a wife nor to beget
children, because all the inhabitants of the land, sons and daughters,
mothers and fathers, are to perish by sickness, the sword, and famine
([Jer 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#003) and [Jer
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004)). He is both to abstain from the
customary usages of mourning for the dead, and to keep away from
mirthful feasts, in order to give the people to understand that, by
reason of the multitude of the dead, customary mourning will have to be
given up, and that all opportunity for merry-making will disappear ([Jer
16:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005)). Adapting thus his actions to
help to convey his message, he will approve himself to be the mouth of
the Lord, and then the promised divine protection will not fail. Thus
closely is this passage connected with the preceding complaint and
reproof of the prophet ([Jer
15:10-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010)), while it at the same time
further continues the threatening of judgment in [Jer
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001). - With the prohibition to take
a wife, cf. the apostle's counsel, [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026). "This place" alternates with
"this land," and so must not be limited to Jerusalem, but bears on Judah
at large. ילּדים, adject. verbale, as in Ex. 1:32. The form ממותי is
found, besides here, only in [Eze
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#008), where it takes the place of
מותי, [Jer 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010). תחלאים ממותי, lit.,
deaths of sicknesses or sufferings, i.e., deaths by all kinds of
sufferings, since תחלאים is not to be confined to disease, but in [Jer
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018) is used of pining away by
famine. With "they shall not be lamented," cf. [Jer
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#033); [Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002); [Jer
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#016); [Jer
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033).

[Jeremiah 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 16:5</span></span>

The command not to go into a house of mourning (מרזח, loud crying, cry
of lament for one dead, see on [Amo
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#007)), not to show sympathy with the
survivors, is explained by the Lord in the fearfully solemn saying: I
withdraw from this people my peace, grace, and mercy. שׁלום is not "the
inviolateness of the relation between me and my people" (Graf), but the
pace of God which rested on Judah, the source of its well-being, of its
life and prosperity, and which showed itself to the sinful race in the
extension to them of grace and mercy. The consequence of the withdrawal
of this peace is the death of great and small in such multitudes that
they can neither be buried nor mourned for ([Jer
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006)). התגּדד, but one's self, is used
in [Deu 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001) for נתן שׂרט, to make
cuts in the body, [Lev 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028); and קרח,
Niph., to crop one's self bald, acc. to [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001), to shave a bare place on the
front part of the head above the eyes. These are two modes of expressing
passionate mourning for the dead which were forbidden to the Israelites
in the law, yet which remained in use among the people, see on [Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028) and [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001). להם, for them, in honour of the
dead.

[Jeremiah 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 16:7</span></span>

פּרס, as in [Isa 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007), for פּרשׂ, [Lam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004), break, sc. the bread (cf. Isa.
l.c.) for mourning, and to give to drink the cup of comfort, does not
refer to the meals which were held in the house of mourning upon
occasion of a death after the interment, for this custom cannot be
proved of the Israelites in Old Testament times, and is not strictly
demanded by the words of the verse. To break bread to any one does not
mean to hold a feast with him, but to bestow a gift of bread upon him;
cf. [Isa 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007). Correspondingly, to
give to drink, does not here mean to drink to one's health at a feast,
but only to present with wine to drink. The words refer to the custom of
sending bread and wine for refreshment into the house of the surviving
relatives of one dead, to comfort them in their sorrow; cf. [Sa2
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#035); [Sa2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#016)., and the remarks on [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017). The singular suffixes on לנחמו,
אביו, and אמּו, alongside of the plurals להם and אותם, are to be taken
distributively of every one who is to be comforted upon occasion of a
death in his house; and להם is not to be changed, as by J. D. Mich. and
Hitz., into לחם.

[Jeremiah 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 16:8</span></span>

The prophet is to withdraw from all participation in mirthful meals and
feasts, in token that God will take away all joy from the people.
בּית־משׁתּה, house in which a feast is given. אותם, for אתּם, refers,
taken ad sensum, to the others who take part in the feast. On [Jer
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009), cf. [Jer
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034).

[Jeremiah 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 16:10</span></span>

"And when thou showest this people all these things, and they say unto
thee, Wherefore hath Jahveh pronounced all this great evil against us,
and what is our transgression, and what our sin that we have committed
against Jahveh our God? [Jer 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011).
Then say thou to them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith
Jahveh, and have walked after other gods, and served them, and
worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and not kept my law; [Jer
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#012). And ye did yet worse than your
fathers; and behold, ye walk each after the stubbornness of his evil
heart, hearkening not unto me. [Jer
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013). Therefore I cast you out of
this land into the land which he know not, neither ye nor your fathers,
and there may ye serve other gods day and night, because I will show you
no favour. [Jer 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014). Therefore,
behold, the days come, saith Jahveh, that it shall no more be said, By
the life of Jahveh, that brought up the sons of Israel out of the land
of Egypt, [Jer 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015). But, By the life
of Jahveh, that brought the sons of Israel out of the land of the north,
and out of all the lands whither I had driven them, and I bring them
again into their land that I gave to their fathers."

The turn of the discourse in [Jer
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010) and [Jer
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011) is like that in [Jer
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019). With [Jer
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011) cf. [Jer
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008), [Jer
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#010); [Jer
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#024); with "ye did yet worse," etc.,
cf. [Kg1 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#009); and on "after the
stubbornness," cf. on [Kg1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#017). The
apodosis begins with "therefore I cast you out." On this head cf. [Jer
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#015); [Jer
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015), and [Jer
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#026). The article in על־הארץ, Graf
quite unnecessarily insists on having cancelled, as out of place. It is
explained sufficiently by the fact, that the land, of which mention has
so often been made, is looked on as a specific one, and is characterized
by the following relative clause, as one unknown to the people. Besides,
the "ye know not" is not meant of geographical ignorance, but, as is
often the case with ידע, the knowledge is that obtained by direct
experience. They know not the land, because they have never been there.
"There ye may serve them," Ros. justly characterizes as concessio cum
ironia: there ye may serve, as long as ye will, the gods whom ye have so
longed after. The irony is especially marked in the "day and night."
Here Jeremiah has in mind [Deu 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#028);
[Deu 28:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036), [Deu
28:63](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063). אשׁר is causal, giving the
grounds of the threat, "I cast you out." The form חנינה is hap leg . -
In [Jer 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014) and [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015) the prophet opens to the people
a view of ultimate redemption from the affliction amidst the heathen,
into which, for their sin, they will be cast. By and by men will swear
no more by Jahveh who redeemed them out of Egypt, but by Jahveh who has
brought them again from the land of the north and the other lands into
which they have been thrust forth. In this is implied that this second
deliverance will be a blessing which shall outshine the former blessing
of redemption from Egypt. But just as this deliverance will excel the
earlier one, so much the greater will the affliction of Israel in the
northern land be than the Egyptian bondage had been. On this point Ros.
throws especial weight, remarking that the aim of these verses is not so
much to give promise of coming salvation, as to announce instare illis
atrocius malum, quam illud Aegyptiacum, eamque quam mox sint subituri
servitutem multo fore duriorem, quam olim Aegyptiaca fuerit. But though
this idea does lie implicite in the words, yet we must not fail to be
sure that the prospect held out of a future deliverance of Israel from
the lands into which it is soon to be scattered, and of its restoration
again to the land of its fathers, has, in the first and foremost place,
a comforting import, and that it is intended to preserve the godly from
despair under the catastrophe which is now awaiting them.

(Note: Calvin has excellently brought out both moments, and has thus
expounded the thought of the passage: "Scitis unde patres vestri
exierint, nempe e fornace aenea, quemadmodum alibi loquitur (xi. 4) et
quasi ex profunda morte; itaque redemptio illa debuit esse memorabilis
usque ad finem mundi. Sed jam Deus conjiciet vos in abyssum, quae longe
profundior erit illa Aegypti tyrannide, e qua erepti sunt patres vestri;
nam si inde vos redimat, erit miraculum longe excellentius ad posteros,
ut fere exstinguat vel saltem obscuret memoriam prioris illius
redemptionis.")

לכן is not nevertheless, but, as universally, therefore; and the train
of thought is as follows: Because the Lord will, for their idolatry,
cast forth His people into the lands of the heathen, just for that very
reason will their redemption from exile not fail to follow, and this
deliverance surpass in gloriousness the greatest of all former deeds of
blessing, the rescue of Israel from Egypt. The prospect of future
redemption given amidst announcements of judgment cannot be surprising
in Jeremiah, who elsewhere also interweaves the like happy forecastings
with his most solemn threatenings; cf. [Jer
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027); [Jer
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010), [Jer
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018), with [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014)., [Jer
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003)., etc. "This ray of light,
falling suddenly into the darkness, does not take us more by surprise
than 'I will not make a full end,' [Jer
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027). There is therefore no reason for
regarding these two verses as interpolations from [Jer
23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#007)" (Graf).

[Jeremiah 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 16:16</span></span>

Further account of the punishment foretold, with the reasons for the
same. - [Jer 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016). "Behold, I send
for many fishers, saith Jahve, who shall fish them, and after will I
send fore many hunters, who shall hunt them from every mountain and
every hill, and out of the clefts of the rock. [Jer
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#017). For mine eyes are upon all
their ways, they are not hidden from me, neither is their iniquity
concealed from mine eyes. [Jer 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018).
And first, I requite double their iniquity and their sin, because they
defiled my land with the carcases of their detestables, and with their
abominations they have filled mine inheritance. [Jer
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019). Jahveh, my strength and my
fortress, and my refuge in the day of trouble! Unto Thee shall the
peoples come from the ends of the earth and say: But lies have our
fathers inherited, vanity, and amidst them none profiteth at all. [Jer
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#020). Shall a man make gods to
himself, which are yet no gods? [Jer
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#021). Therefore, behold, I make them
to know this once, I make them to know my hand and my might, and they
shall know that my name is Jahveh."

[Jer 16:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016)

[Jer 16:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016) are a continuation of
the threatening in [Jer 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013), that
Judah is to be cast out, but are directly connected with [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015), and elucidate the expulsion
into many lands there foretold. The figures of the fishers and hunters
do not bespeak the gathering again and restoration of the scattered
people, as Ven. would make out, but the carrying of Judah captive out of
his land. This is clear from the second of the figures, for the hunter
does not gather the animals together, but kills them; and the reference
of the verses is put beyond a doubt by [Jer
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#017) and [Jer
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018), and is consequently admitted by
all other comm. The two figures signify various kinds of treatment at
the hands of enemies. The fishers represent the enemies that gather the
inhabitants of the land as in a net, and carry them wholesale into
captivity (cf. [Amo 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002); [Hab
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015)). The hunters, again, are those
who drive out from their hiding-places, and slay or carry captive such
as have escaped from the cities, and have taken refuge in the mountains
and ravines; cf. [Jer 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029), [Jdg
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002) [Sa1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006). In this the idea is visibly set
forth that none shall escape the enemy. שׁלה c. ל pers., send for one,
cause him to come, as in [Jer 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#003)
(send for water), so that there is no call to take ל according to the
Aram. usage as sign of the accusative, for which we can cite in Jeremiah
only the case in [Jer 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#002). The form
דּוּגים (Chet.) agrees with [Eze
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010), while the Keri, דּיּגים, is a
formation similar to ציּדים. In the second clause רבּים is, like the
numerals, made to precede the noun; cf. [Pro
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#029); [Psa
89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051). - For the Lord knows their
doings and dealings, and their transgressions are not hid from Him; cf.
[Jer 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#024); [Jer
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019). על for אל, indicating the
direction. Their ways are not the ways of flight, but their course of
action.

[Jer 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018)

The punishment foretold is but retribution for their sins. Because they
have defiled the land by idolatry, they shall be driven out of it.
ראשׁונה, first, is by Jerome, Hitz., Ew., Umbr. made to refer to the
salvation promised in [Jer 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015) :
first, i.e., before the restoration of my favour spoken of in [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015), I requite double. Against this
Graf has objected, that on this view "first" would appear somewhat
superfluous; and Ng., that the manifestly intended antithesis to משׁנה
is left out of account. There is little force in either objection. Even
Ng.'s paraphrase does not do full justice to the presumed antithesis;
for if we render: "For the first time the double shall be requited, in
the event of repetition a severer standard shall be used," then the
antithesis to "first" would not be "double," but the supplied repetition
of the offence. There is not the slightest hint in the context to lead
us to supply this idea; nor is there any antithesis between "first" and
"double." It is a mere assumption of the comm., which Rashi, Kimchi,
Ros., Maur., etc., have brought into the text by the interpolation of a
ו cop. before משׁנה: I requite the first of their transgressions and the
repetition of them, i.e., their earlier and their repeated sins, or the
sins committed by their fathers and by themselves, on a greater scale.
We therefore hold the reference to [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015) to be the only true one, and
regard it as corresponding both to the words before us and the context.
"The double of their iniquity," i.e., ample measure for their sins (cf.
[Isa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002); [Job
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006)) by way of the horrors of war and
the sufferings of the exile. The sins are more exactly defined by:
because they defiled my land by the carcases of their detestables, i.e.,
their dead detestable idols. שׁקּוּצים נבלת is formed according to פּגרי
, [Lev 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030), and it belongs to "they
defiled," not to "they filled," as the Masoretic accentuation puts it;
for מלא is construed, not with בּ of the thing, but with double accus.;
cf. [Eze 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017); [Eze
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#011), etc. So it is construed in the
last clause: With their abominations they have filled the inheritance of
Jahveh, i.e., the land of the Lord (cf. [Jer
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007)). The infin. חלּלם is continued by
מלאוּ in verbo fin., as usual.

In [Jer 16:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019) we have more as to
the necessity of the threatened punishment. The prophet turns to the
Lord as his defence and fortress in time of need, and utters the hope
that even the heathen may some time turn to the Lord and confess the
vanity of idolatry, since the gods which men make are no gods. To this
the Lord answers in [Jer 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#021), that
just therefore He must punish His idolatrous people, so that they shall
feel His power and learn to know His name.

[Jer 16:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019)

In his cry to the Lord: My strength...in the day of trouble, which
agrees closely with [Psa 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008); [Psa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#017); [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003), Jeremiah utters not merely his
own feelings, but those which would animate every member of his people.
In the time of need the powerlessness of the idols to help, and so their
vanity, becomes apparent. Trouble therefore drives to God, the Almighty
Lord and Ruler of the world, and forces to bend under His power. The
coming tribulation is to have this fruit not only in the case of the
Israelites, but also in that of the heathen nations, so that they shall
see the vanity of the idolatry they have inherited from their fathers,
and be converted to the Lord, the only true God. How this knowledge is
to be awakened in the heathen, Jeremiah does not disclose; but it may be
gathered from [Jer 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015), from the
deliverance of Israel, there announced, out of the heathen lands into
which they had been cast forth. By this deliverance the heathen will be
made aware both of the almighty power of the God of Israel and of the
nothingness of their own gods. On הבל cf. [Jer
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005); and with "none that profiteth,"
cf. [Jer 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008); [Jer
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022). In [Jer
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#020) the prophet confirms what the
heathen have been saying. The question has a negative force, as is clear
from the second clause. In [Jer 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#021)
we have the Lord's answer to the prophets' confession in [Jer
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019). Since the Jews are so blinded
that they prefer vain idols to the living God, He will this time so show
them His hand and His strength in that foretold chastisement, that they
shall know His name, i.e., know that He alone is God in deed and in
truth. Cf. [Eze 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#015); [Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014).
