### [Isaiah Chapter 58](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 58:1</span></span>

As the last prophecy of the second book contained all the three elements
of prophetic addresses - reproach, threat, and promise - so this, the
first prophecy of the third book, cannot open in any other way than with
a rehearsal of one of these. The prophet receives the commission to
appear as the preacher of condemnation; and whilst Jehovah is giving the
reason for this commission, the preaching itself commences. "Cry with
full throat, hold not back; lift up thy voice like a bugle, and proclaim
to my people their apostasy, and to the house of Jacob their sins. And
they seek me day by day, and desire to learn my ways, like a nation
which has done righteousness, and has not forsaken the right of their
God: they ask of me judgments of righteousness; they desire the drawing
near of Elohim." As the second prophecy of the first part takes as its
basis a text from Micah ([Mic 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001).md),
so have we here in [Isa 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md) the echo
of [Mic 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008.md). Not only with lisping
lips ([Sa1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#013).md), but with the throat
([Psa 115:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007.md); [Psa
149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006).md); that is to say, with all the
strength of the voice, lifting up the voice like the shōphâr (not a
trumpet, which is called חצצרה, nor in fact any metallic instrument, but
a bugle or signal horn, like that blown on new year's day: see at [Psa
81:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#004).md), i.e., in a shrill shouting
tone. With a loud voice that must be heard, with the most unsparing
publicity, the prophet is to point out to the people their deep moral
wounds, which they may indeed hide from themselves with hypocritical
opus operatum, but cannot conceal from the all-seeing God. The ו of
ואותי does not stand for an explanatory particle, but for an adversative
one: "their apostasy ... their sins; and yet (although they are to be
punished for these) they approach Jehovah every day" (יום יום with
mahpach under the first יום, and pasek after it, as is the general rule
between two like-sounding words), "that He would now speedily
interpose." They also desire to know the ways which He intends to take
for their deliverance, and by which He desires to lead them. This
reminds us of the occurrence between Ezekiel and the elders of Gola
([Eze 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001.md).; compare also [Eze
33:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#030)..md). As if they had been a people
whose rectitude of action and fidelity to the commands of God warranted
them in expecting nothing but what was good in the future, they ask God
(viz., in prayer and by inquiring of the prophet) for mishpetē tsedeq,
"righteous manifestations of judgment" i.e., such as will save them and
destroy their foes, and desire qirbath 'Elōhı̄m, the coming of God, i.e.,
His saving parousia. The energetic futures, with the tone upon the last
syllable, answer to their self-righteous presumption; and יחפצוּן is
repeated, according to Isaiah's most favourite oratorical figure, at the
close of the verse.

[Isaiah 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 58:3</span></span>

There follow now the words of the work-righteous themselves, who hold up
their fasting before the eyes of God, and complain that He takes no
notice of it. And how could He?! "'Wherefore do we fast and Thou seest
not, afflict our soul and Thou regardest not?' Behold, on the day of
your fasting ye carry on your business, and ye oppress all your
labourers. Behold, ye fast with strife and quarrelling, and with smiting
with the fist maliciously closed: ye do not fast now to make your voice
audible on high." By the side of צוּם (root צם, to press, tie up,
constrain) we have here the older expression found in the Pentateuch,
נפשׁ ענּה, to do violence to the natural life. In addition to the
fasting on the day of atonement (the tenth of the seventh month Tizri),
the only fast prescribed by the law, other fasts were observed according
to [Zac 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003.md); [Zac
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019.md), viz., fasts to commemorate the
commencement of the siege of Jerusalem (10th Tebeth), its capture (17th
Tammuz), its destruction (9th Aibb), and the murder of Gedaliah (3rd
Tizri). The exiles boast of this fasting here; but it is a heartless,
dead work, and therefore worthless in the sight of God. There is the
most glaring contrast between the object of the fast and their conduct
on the fast-day: for they carry on their work-day occupation; they are
then, more than at any other time, true taskmasters to their work-people
(lest the service of the master should suffer form the service of God);
and because when fasting they are doubly irritable and ill-tempered,
this leads to quarrelling and strife, and even to striking with angry
fist (בּאגרף, from גּרף, to collect together, make into a ball, clench).
Hence in their present state the true purpose of fasting is quite
unknown to them, viz., to enable them to draw near with importunate
prayer to God, who is enthroned on high ([Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015).md).

(Note: The ancient church called a fast statio, because he who fasted
had to wait in prayer day and night like a soldier at his post. See on
this and what follows, the Shepherd of Hermas, iii. Sim. 5, and the
Epistle of Barnabas, c. iii.)

The only difficulty here is the phrase חפץ מצא. In the face of [Isa
58:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013.md), this cannot have any other
meaning than to stretch one's hand after occupation, to carry on
business, to occupy one's self with it - חפץ combining the three
meanings, application or affairs, striving, and trade or occupation.
מצא, however, maintains its primary meaning, to lay hold of or grasp
(cf., [Isa 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#014.md); Targ. צרכיכון תּבעין
אתּוּן, ye seek your livelihood). This is sustained by what follows,
whether we derive עצּביכם (cf., חלּקי, [Isa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#006).md) from עצב (et omnes labores
vestros graves rigide exigitis), נגשׂ (from which we have here תּנגּשׂוּ
for תּגּשׂוּ, [Deu 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#003).md) being
construed as in [Kg2 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#035.md) with the
accusative of what is peremptorily demanded; or (what we certainly
prefer) from עצב; or better still from עצב morf ll (like עמל): omnes
operarios vestros adigitis (urgetis), נגשׂ being construed with the
accusative of the person oppressed, as in [Deu
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002.md), where it is applied to the
oppression of a debtor. Here, however, the reference is not to those who
owe money, but to those who owe labour, or to obligations to labour; and
עצב does not signify a debtor (an idea quite foreign to this verbal
root), but a labourer, one who eats the bread of sorrows, or of hard
toil ([Psa 127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002).md). The prophet paints
throughout from the life; and we cannot be persuaded by Stier's false
zeal for Isaiah's authorship to give up the opinion, that we have here a
figure drawn from the life of the exiles in Babylon.

[Isaiah 58:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 58:5</span></span>

Whilst the people on the fast-day are carrying on their worldly,
selfish, everyday business, the fasting is perverted from a means of
divine worship and absorption in the spiritual character of the day to
the most thoroughly selfish purposes: it is supposed to be of some worth
and to merit some reward. This work-holy delusion, behind which
self-righteousness and unrighteousness were concealed, is met thus by
Jehovah through His prophet: "Can such things as these pass for a fast
that I have pleasure in, as a day for a man to afflict his soul? To bow
down his head like a bulrush, and spread sackcloth and ashes under him -
dost thou call this a fast and an acceptable day for Jehovah? Is not
this a fast that I have pleasure in: To loose coils of wickedness, to
untie the bands of the yoke, and for sending away the oppressed as free,
and that ye break every kind of yoke? Is it not this, to break thy bread
to the hungry, and to take the poor and houseless to thy home; when thou
seest a naked man that thou clothest him, and dost not deny thyself
before thine own flesh?" The true worship, which consists in works of
merciful love to one's brethren, and its great promises are here placed
in contrast with the false worship just described. הכזה points
backwards: is such a fast as this a fast after Jehovah's mind, a day on
which it can be said in truth that a man afflicts his soul ([Lev
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029).md)? The ה of הלכף is resumed in
הלזה; the second ל is the object to תּקרא expressed as a dative. The
first ל answers to our preposition "to" with the infinitive, which
stands here at the beginning like a casus absol. (to hang down; for
which the inf. abs. הכפוף might also be used), and as in most other
cases passes over into the finite (et quod saccum et cinerem substernit,
viz., sibi: Ges. 132, Anm. 2). To hang down the head and sit in
sackcloth and ashes - this does not in itself deserve the name of
fasting and of a day of gracious reception ([Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md); [Isa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002).md) on the part of Jehovah (ליהוה
for a subjective genitive).

[Isa 58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md) and [Isa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007.md) affirm that the fasting which is
pleasant to Jehovah consists in something very different from this,
namely, in releasing the oppressed, and in kindness to the helpless; not
in abstinence form eating as such, but in sympathetic acts of that
self-denying love, which gives up bread or any other possession for the
sake of doing good to the needy.

(Note: The ancient church connected fasting with almsgiving by law.
Dressel, Patr. Ap. p. 493.)

There is a bitter irony in these words, just as when the ancients said,
"not eating is a natural fast, but abstaining form sin is a spiritual
fast." During the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans a general
emancipation of the slaves of Israelitish descent (who were to be set
free, according to the law, every three years) was resolved upon and
carried out; but as soon as the Chaldeans were gone, the masters fetched
their liberated slaves back into servitude again ([Jer
34:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008).md). And as [Isa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md) shows, they carried the same
selfish and despotic disposition with them into captivity. The זה which
points forwards is expanded into infin. absolutes, which are carried on
quite regularly in the finite tense. Mōtâh, which is repeated
palindromically, signifies in both cases a yoke, lit., vectis, the cross
wood which formed the most important part of the yoke, and which was
fastened to the animal's head, and so connected with the plough by means
of a cord or strap (Sir. 30:13; 33:27).

(Note: I have already observed at [Isa
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006.md), in vindication of what was
stated at [Isa 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027.md), that the yoke
was not in the form of a collar. I brought the subject under the notice
of Prof. Schegg, who wrote to me immediately after his return from his
journey to Palestine to the following effect: "I saw many oxen ploughing
in Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and the neighbourhood of Ephesus; and in
every case the yoke was a cross piece of wood laid upon the neck of the
animal, and fastened to the pole of the plough by a cord which passed
under the neck of the animal.")

It is to this that אגדּות, knots, refers. We cannot connect it with
mutteh, a state of perverted right ([Eze
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009).md), as Hitzig does. רצוּצים are
persons unjustly and forcibly oppressed even with cruelty; רצץ is a
stronger synonym to עשׂק (e.g., [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001).md). In [Isa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007.md) we have the same spirit of
general humanity as in [Job 31:13-23](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013.md);
[Eze 18:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#007.md) (compare what James
describes in [Jam 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md) as "pure
religion and undefiled"). לחם (פרשׂ) פרץ is the usual phrase for κλᾶν
(κλάζειν) ἄρτον. מרוּדים is the adjective to עניּים, and apparently
therefore must be derived from מרד: miserable men who have shown
themselves refractory towards despotic rulers. But the participle mârūd
cannot be found elsewhere; and the recommendation to receive political
fugitives has a modern look. The parallels in [Lam
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#007.md) and [Lam
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019.md) are conclusive evidence, that the
word is intended as a derivative of רוּד, to wander about, and it is so
rendered in the lxx, Targ., and Jerome (vagos). But מרוד, pl. מרוּדים,
is no adjective; and there is nothing to recommend the opinion, that by
"wanderers" we are to understand Israelitish men. Ewald supposes that
מרוּדים may be taken as a part. hoph. for מוּרדים, hunted away, like
הממותים in [Kg2 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#002) (Keri המּמתים.md);
but it cannot be shown that the language allowed of this shifting of a
vowel-sound. We prefer to assume that מרוּדים (persecuted) is regarded
as part. pass., even if only per metaplasmum, from מרד, a secondary form
of רוּד (cf., מכס, מלץ, מצח, makuna). [Isa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007.md) is still the virtual subject to
אבחרהוּ צום. The apodosis to the hypothetical כּי commences with a perf.
consec., which then passes into the pausal future תתעלּם. In
hsilgnE:egaugnaL\\&מבשׂרך (from thine own flesh) it is presupposed that
all men form one united whole as being of the same flesh and blood, and
that they form one family, owing to one another mutual love.

[Isaiah 58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 58:8</span></span>

The prophet now proceeds to point out the reward of divine grace, which
would follow such a fast as this, consisting of self-renouncing,
self-sacrificing love; and in the midst of the promise he once more
reminds of the fact, that this love is the condition of the promise.
This divides the promises into two. The middle promise is linked on to
the first; the morning dawn giving promise of the "perfect day" ([Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018).md). The first series of promises we
have in [Isa 58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008.md), [Isa
58:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#009.md). "Then will thy light break forth
as the morning dawn, and thy healing will sprout up speedily, and thy
righteousness will go before thee, the glory of Jehovah will follow
thee. Then wilt thou call and Jehovah will answer; thou wilt beseech,
and He will say, Here am I!" The love of God is called "light" in
contrast with His wrath; and a quiet cheerful life in God's love is so
called, in contrast with a wild troubled life spent in God's wrath. This
life in God's love has its dawn and its noon-day. When it is night both
within and around a man, and he suffers himself to be awakened by the
love of God to a reciprocity of love; then does the love of God, like
the rising sun, open for itself a way through the man's dark night and
overcome the darkness of wrath, but so gradually that the sky within is
at first only streaked as it were with the red of the morning dawn, the
herald of the sun. A second figure of a promising character follows. The
man is sick unto death; but when the love of God stimulates him to
reciprocal love, he is filled with new vigour, and his recovery springs
up suddenly; he feels within him a new life working through with
energetic force like a miraculous springing up of verdure from the
earth, or of growing and flowering plants. The only other passages in
which ארוּכה occurs are in the books of Jeremiah, Chronicles, and
Nehemiah. It signifies recovery (lxx here, τὰ ἰάματά σου ταχὺ ἀνατελεῖ,
an old mistake for ἱμάτια, vestimenta), and hence general prosperity
([Ch2 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#013).md). It always occurs with
the predicate עלתה (causative העלה, cf., Targ. [Psa
147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md), ארכא אסּק, another reading
ארוּכין), oritur (for which we have here poetically germinat) alicui
sanitas; hence Gesenius and others have inferred, that the word
originally meant the binding up of a wound, bandage (impontiru alicui
fascia). But the primary word is ארך = ארך, to set to rights, to restore
or put into the right condition (e.g., b. Sabbath 33b, "he cured his
wounded flesh"), connected with אריך, Arab. ârak, accommodatus; so that
ארוּכה, after the form מלוּכה, Arab. (though rarely) arika, signifies
properly, setting to rights, i.e., restoration.

The third promise is: "thy righteousness will go before thee, the glory
of Jehovah will gather thee, or keep thee together," i.e., be thy
rear-guard (lxx περιστελεῖ σε, enclose thee with its protection; אסף as
in מאסּף, [Isa 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012).md). The figure is a
significant one: the first of the mercies of God is δικαιοῦν, and the
last δοξάζειν. When Israel is diligent in the performance of works of
compassionate love, it is like an army on the march or a travelling
caravan, for which righteousness clear and shows the way as being the
most appropriate gift of God, and whose rear is closed by the glory of
God, which so conducts it to its goal that not one is left behind. The
fourth promise assures them of the immediate hearing of prayer, of every
appeal to God, every cry for help.

But before the prophet brings his promises up to their culminating
point, he once more lays down the condition upon which they rest. "If
thou put away from the midst of thee the yoke, the pointing of the
finger, and speaking of evil, and offerest up thy gluttony to the
hungry, and satisfiest the soul that is bowed down: thy light will
stream out in the darkness, and thy darkness become like the brightness
of noon-day. And Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy
soul in droughts, and refresh thy bones; and thou wilt become like a
well-watered garden, and like a fountain, whose waters never deceive.
And thy people will build ruins of the olden time, foundations of
earlier generations wilt thou erect; and men will call thee repairers of
breaches, restorers of habitable streets." מוטה, a yoke, is here
equivalent to yoking or oppression, as in [Isa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md), where it stands by the side of
רשׁע. שׁלח־אצבּא (only met with here, for שׁלח, Ges. 65, 1, a), the
stretching out of the finger, signifies a scornful pointing with the
fingers ([Pro 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013), δακτυλοδεικτεῖν.md)
at humbler men, and especially at such as are godly ([Isa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#004).md). דּבּר־און, the utterance of
things which are wicked in themselves and injurious to one's neighbour,
hence sinful conversation in general. The early commentators looked for
more under נפשׁך, than is really meant (and so does even Stier: "they
soul, thy heart, all thy sympathetic feelings," etc.). The name of the
soul, which is regarded here as greedily longing ([Isa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011).md), is used in [Deu
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006.md) for that which nourishes it, and
here for that which it longs for; the longing itself (appetitus) for the
object of the longing (Psychol. p. 204). We may see this very clearly
from the choice of the verb תּפק (a voluntative in a conditional clause,
Ges. 128, 2), which, starting from the primary meaning educere (related
to נפק, Arabic anfaqa, to give out, distribute, nafaqa, distribution,
especially of alms), signifies both to work out, acquire, carry off
([Pro 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013.md); [Pro
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#035), etc..md), and also to take out,
deliver, offer, expromere (as in this instance and [Psa
140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md); [Psa
144:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013).md). The soul "bowed down" is
bowed down in this instance through abstinence. The apodoses commence
with the perf. cons. וזרח. אפלה is the darkness caused by the utter
absence of light (Arab. afalat esh-shemsu, "the sun has become
invisible"); see at [Job 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022.md). This,
as the substantive clause affirms, is like the noon-day, which is called
צהרים, because at that point the daylight of both the forenoon and
afternoon, the rising and setting light, is divided as it were into two
by the climax which it has attained. A new promise points to the fat,
that such a man may enjoy without intermission the mild and safe
guidance of divine grace, for which נחה (הנחה, syn. נהל) is the word
commonly employed; and another to the communication of the most copious
supply of strength. The ἅπαξ γεγρ בצחצחות does not state with what God
will satisfy the soul, as Hahn supposes (after Jerome, "splendoribus"),
but according to צסהיחה ([Psa 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007).md)
and such promises as [Isa 43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md); [Isa
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#021.md); [Isa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010.md), the kind of satisfaction and
the circumstances under which it occurs, viz., in extreme droughts
(Targ. "years of drought"). In the place of the perf. cons. we have then
the future, which facilitates the elevation of the object: "and thy
bones will He make strong," יחליח, for which Hupfeld would read יחליף,
"will He rejuvenate." חחליץ is a denom. of חלוּץ, expeditus; it may,
however, be directly derived from a verb חלץ, presupposed by חלצים, not,
however, in the meaning "to be fat" (lxx πιανθήσεται, and so also
Kimchi), but "to be strong," lit., to be loose or ready for action; and
b. Jebamoth 102b has the very suitable gloss גרמי זרוזי (making the
bones strong). This idea of invigorating is then unfolded in two
different figures, of which that of a well-watered garden sets forth the
abundance received, that of a spring the abundance possessed. Natural
objects are promised, but as a gift of grace; for this is the difference
between the two testaments, that in the Old Testament the natural is
ever striving to reach the spiritual, whereas in the New Testament the
spiritual lifts up the natural to its own level. The Old Testament is
ever striving to give inwardness to what was outward; in the New
Testament this object is attained, and the further object now is to make
the outward conformed to the inward, the natural life to the spiritual.

The last promise (whether the seventh or eighth, depends upon whether we
include the growing of the morning light into the light of noon, or not)
takes its form from the pining of the exiles for their home: "and thy
people (ממּך) build" (Ewald, 295, c); and Bttcher would read ממך
וּבנּוּ; but מן with a passive, although more admissible in Hebrew than
in Arabic, is very rarely met with, and then more frequently in the
sense of ἀπό than in that of ὑπό, and בּנּוּ followed by a plural of the
thing would be more exact than customary. Moreover, there is no force in
the objection that ממּך with the active can only signify "some of thee,"
since it is equivalent to ממך אשׁר, those who sprang from thee and
belong to thee by kindred descent. The members born to the congregation
in exile will begin, as soon as they return to their home, to build up
again the ruins of olden time, the foundations of earlier generations,
i.e., houses and cities of which only the foundations are left ([Isa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004).md); therefore Israel restored to
its fatherland receives the honourable title of "builder of breaches,"
"restorer of streets (i.e., of places much frequented once) לשׁבת" (for
inhabiting), i.e., so that, although so desolate now ([Isa
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008).md), they become habitable and
populous once more.

[Isaiah 58:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 58:13</span></span>

The third part of the prophecy now adds to the duties of human love the
duty of keeping the Sabbath, together with equally great promises; i.e.,
it adds the duties of the first table to those of the second, for the
service of works is sanctified by the service of worship. "If thou hold
back thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy business on my holy day,
and callest the Sabbath a delight, the holy of Jehovah, reverer, and
honourest it, not doing thine own ways, not pursuing thy business and
speaking words: then wilt thou have delight in Jehovah, and I will cause
thee to ride upon the high places of the land, and make thee enjoy the
inheritance of Jacob thy forefather, for the mouth of Jehovah hath
spoken it." The duty of keeping the Sabbath is also enforced by Jeremiah
([Jer 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019)..md) and Ezekiel ([Eze
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#012.md)., [Eze
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#008.md), [Eze
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026).md), and the neglect of this duty
severely condemned. Chapter 56 has already shown the importance attached
to it by our prophet. The Sabbath, above all other institutions
appointed by the law, was the true means of uniting and sustaining
Israel as a religious community, more especially in exile, where a great
part of the worship necessarily feel into abeyance on account of its
intimate connection with Jerusalem and the holy land; but whilst it was
a Mosaic institution so far as its legal appointments were concerned, it
rested, in a way which reached even beyond the rite of circumcision,
upon a basis much older than that of the law, being a ceremonial copy of
the Sabbath of creation, which was the divine rest established by God as
the true object of all motion; for God entered into Himself again after
He had created the world out of Himself, that all created things might
enter into Him. In order that this, the great end set before all
creation, and especially before mankind, viz., entrance into the rest of
God, might be secured, the keeping of the Sabbath prescribed by the law
was a divine method of education, which put an end every week to the
ordinary avocations of the people, with their secular influence and
their tendency to fix the mind on outward things, and was designed by
the strict prohibition of all work to force them to enter into
themselves and occupy their minds with God and His word. The prophet
does not hedge round this commandment to keep the Sabbath with any new
precepts, but merely demands for its observance full truth answering to
the spirit of the letter. "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath"
is equivalent to, if thou do not tread upon its holy ground with a foot
occupied with its everyday work.

עשׂות which follows is not elliptical (= מעשׂות answering to משּׁבּת, an
unnecessary and mistaken assumption), but an explanatory permutative of
the object "thy foot:" "turn away thy foot," viz., from attending to thy
business (a defective plural) on my holy day. Again, if thou call (i.e.,
from inward contemplation and esteem) the Sabbath a pleasure (‛ōneg,
because it leads thee to God, and not a burden because it leads thee
away from thine everyday life; cf., [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005).md) and the holy one of Jehovah (on
this masculine personification of the Sabbath, see [Isa
56:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#002).md), "mekhubbâd," honoured =
honourable, honorandus, and if thou truly honourest him, whom Jehovah
has invested with the splendour of His own glory ([Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003) : "and sanctified it".md), "not" (מן
= ὥστε μὴ) "to perform thy ways" (the ordinary ways which relate to
self-preservation, not to God), "not to attend to thine own business'
(see at [Isa 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003).md) "and make words,"
viz., words of vain useless character and needless multitude
(דּבּר־דּברas in [Hos 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md), denoting
unspiritual gossip and boasting);

(Note: Hitzig observes, that "the law of the Sabbath has already
received the Jewish addition, 'speaking is work.' " But from the premiss
that the sabbatical rest of God was rest from speaking His creating word
([Psa 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006).md), all the conclusion that
tradition has ever drawn is, that on the Sabbath men must to a certain
extent rest מהדבור as well as ממעשׂה; and when R. Simon b. Jochai
exclaimed to his loquacious old mother on the Sabbath, "Keeping the
Sabbath means keeping silence," his meaning was not that talking in
itself was working and therefore all conversation was forbidden on the
Sabbath. Tradition never went as far as this. The rabbinical exposition
of the passage before us is the following: "Let not thy talking on the
Sabbath be the same as that on working days;" and when it is stated once
in the Jerusalem Talmud that the Rabbins could hardly bring themselves
to allow of friendly greetings on the Sabbath, it certainly follows from
this, that they did not forbid them. Even the author of the ש לה (הברית
לוחות שׂני) with its excessive ceremonial stringency goes no further
than this, that on the Sabbath men must abstain from חול דברי. And is it
possible that our prophet can have been more stringent than the
strictest traditionalists, and wished to make the keeper of the Sabbath
a Carthusian monk? There could not be a more thorough perversion of the
spirit of prophecy than this.)

then, just as the Sabbath is thy pleasure, so wilt thou have thy
pleasure in Jehovah, i.e., enjoy His delightful fellowship (על־ה
תּתענּג, a promise as in [Job 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#026).md),
and He will reward thee for thy renunciation of earthly advantages with
a victorious reign, with an unapproachable possession of the high places
of the land - i.e., chiefly, though not exclusively, of the promised
land, which shall then be restored to thee - and with the free and
undisputed usufruct of the inheritance promised to thy forefather Jacob
([Psa 105:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#010.md); [Deu
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013.md) and [Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029).md) - this will be thy glorious
reward, for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it. Thus does Isaiah
confirm the predictions of [Isa 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#020.md)
and [Isa 40:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#025.md) (compare [Isa
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#003).md).
