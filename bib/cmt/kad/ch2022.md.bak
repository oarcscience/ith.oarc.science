### [2 Chronicles Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 22:1</span></span>

Ahaziah's reign of a year, and his death. - The account of Ahaziah in
[Kg2 8:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026.md) agrees with our
narrative, except that there the reflections of the chronicler on the
spirit of his government are wanting; but, on the contrary, the account
of his death is very brief in the Chronicle ([Ch2
22:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#006).md), while in 2 Kings 9 and 10 the
extirpation of the Ahabic house by Jehu, in the course of which Ahaziah
was slain with his relatives, is narrated at length.

[Ch2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

Instead of the short stereotyped notice, "and Ahaziah his son was king
in his stead," with which [Kg2 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#024.md)
concludes the history of Joram, the Chronicle gives more exact
information as to Ahaziah's accession: "The inhabitants of Jerusalem
made Ahaziah, his youngest son (who is called in [Ch2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017) Jehoahaz.md), king in his stead;
for all the elder (sons), the band which had come among the Arabs to the
camp had slain." In ימליכוּ we have a hint that Ahaziah's succession was
disputed or doubtful; for where the son follows the father on the throne
without opposition, it is simply said in the Chronicle also, "and his
son was king in his stead." But the only person who could contest the
throne with Ahaziah, since all the other sons of Joram who would have
had claims upon it were not then alive, was his mother Athaliah, who
usurped the throne after his death. All the elder sons (הראשׁנים, the
earlier born) were slain by the troop which had come among (with) the
Arabians (see [Ch2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016)..md) into the
camp, - not of the Philistines (Cler.), but of the men of Judah; that
is, they were slain by a reconnoitring party, which, in the invasion of
Judah by the Philistines and Arabs, surprised the camp of the men of
Judah, and slew the elder sons of Joram, who had marched to the war.
Probably they did not cut them down on the spot, but (according to [Ch2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017).md) took them prisoners and slew
them afterwards.

[Ch2 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002.md)

The number 42 is an orthographical error for 22 (ב having been changed
into )מ, [Kg2 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026.md). As Joram was
thirty-two years of age at his accession, and reigned eight years ([Ch2
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020.md) and [Ch2
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#005).md), at his death his youngest son
could not be older than twenty-one or twenty-two years of age, and even
then Joram must have begotten him in his eighteenth or nineteenth year.
It is quite consistent with this that Joram had yet older sons; for in
the East marriages are entered upon at a very early age, and the royal
princes were wont to have several wives, or, besides their proper wives,
concubines also. Certainly, had Ahaziah had forty-two older brothers, as
Berth. and other critics conclude from [Kg2
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#013.md)., then he could not possibly
have been begotten, or been born, in his father's eighteenth year. But
that idea rests merely upon an erroneous interpretation of the passage
quoted; see on [Ch2 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#008.md). Ahaziah's
mother Athaliah is called the daughter, i.e., granddaughter, of Omri, as
in [Kg2 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026.md), because he was the
founder of the idolatrous dynasty of the kingdom of the ten tribes.

[Ch2 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#003.md)

He also (like his father Joram, [Ch2
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#006).md) walked in the ways of the house
of Ahab. This statement is accounted for by the clause: for his mother
(a daughter of Ahab and the godless Jezebel) was his counsellor to do
evil, i.e., led him to give himself up to the idolatry of the house of
Ahab.

[Ch2 22:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#004.md)

The further remark also, "he did that which was displeasing in the sight
of the Lord, like the house of Ahab," is similarly explained; for they
(the members of the house of Ahab related to him through his mother)
were counsellors to him after the death of his father to his
destruction, cf. [Ch2 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023.md); while in
[Kg2 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#027.md), the relationship alone is
spoken of as the reason of his evil-doing. How far this counsel led to
his destruction is narrated in [Ch2
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#005.md) and onwards, and the narrative is
introduced by the words, "He walked also in their counsel;" whence it is
clear beyond all doubt, that Ahaziah entered along with Joram, Ahab's
son, upon the war which was to bring about the destruction of Ahab's
house, and to cost him his life, on the advice of Ahab's relations.
There is no doubt that Joram, Ahab's son, had called upon Ahaziah to
take part in the war against the Syrians at Ramoth Gilead (see on [Ch2
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#028).md), and that Athaliah with her
party supported his proposal, so that Ahaziah complied. In the war the
Aramaeans (Syrians) smote Joram; i.e., according to [Ch2
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#006.md), they wounded him (הרמּים is a
contraction for הארמּים, [Kg2 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#028).md).
In consequence of this Joram returned to Jezreel, the summer residence
of the Ahabic royal house ([Kg1
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#045).md), the present Zerin; see on [Jos
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018.md). המּכּים כּי has no meaning, and
is merely an error for המּכּים מן, [Kg2
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#029.md), which indeed is the reading of
several Codd.: to let himself be cured of his strokes (wounds).
ועזריהוּ, too, is an orthographical error for ועחזיהוּ: and Ahaziah went
down to visit the wounded Joram, his brother-in-law. Whether he went
from Jerusalem or from the loftily-situated Ramah cannot be with
certainty determined, for we have no special account of the course of
the war, and from [Kg2 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#014.md). we only
learn that the Israelite army remained in Ramoth after the return of the
wounded Joram. It is therefore probable that Ahaziah went direct from
Ramoth to visit Joram, but it is not ascertained; for there is nothing
opposed to the supposition that, after Joram had been wounded in the
battle, and while the Israelite host remained to hold the city against
the Syrian king Hazael, Ahaziah had returned to his capital, and thence
went after some time to visit the wounded Joram in Jezreel.

[Ch2 22:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#007.md)

Without touching upon the conspiracy against Joram, narrated in 2 Kings
9, at the head of which was Jehu, the captain of the host, whom God
caused to be anointed king over Israel by a scholar of the prophets
deputed by Elisha, and whom he called upon to extirpate the idolatrous
family of Ahab, since it did not belong to the plan of the Chronicle to
narrate the history of Israel, our historian only briefly records the
slaughter of Ahaziah and his brother's sons by Jehu as being the result
of a divine dispensation.

[Ch2 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#007.md)

"And of God was (came) the destruction (תּבוּסה, a being trodden down, a
formation which occurs here only) of Ahaziah, that he went to Joram;"
i.e., under divine leading had Ahaziah come to Joram, there to find his
death. וגו וּבבאו, and when he was come, he went out with Joram against
Jehu (instead of אל־יהוּא, we have in [Kg2
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#021.md) the more distinct יהוּא לקראת,
towards Jehu) the son of Nimshi, whom God had anointed to extirpate the
house of Ahab ([Kg2 9:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#001).md).

[Ch2 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#008.md)

When Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab (נשׁפּט usually
construed with את, to be at law with any one, to administer justice; cf.
[Isa 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013.md), [Eze
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022).md), he found the princes of Judah,
and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, serving Ahaziah, and slew them.
משׁרתים, i.e., in the train of King Ahaziah as his servants. As to when
and where Jehu met the brothers' sons of Ahaziah and slew them, we have
no further statement, as the author of the Chronicle mentions that fact
only as a proof of the divinely directed extirpation of all the members
of the idolatrous royal house. In [Kg2
10:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#012.md) we read that Jehu, after he
had extirpated the whole Israelite royal house - Joram and Jezebel, and
the seventy sons of Ahab - went to Samaria, there to eradicate the
Baal-worship, and upon his way thither met the brothers of Ahaziah the
king of Judah, and caused them to be taken alive, and then slain, to the
number of forty-two. These עחזיהוּ אחי, forty-two men, cannot have been
actual brothers of Ahaziah, since all Ahaziah's brethren had, according
to [Ch2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md) and [Ch2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017.md), been slain in the reign of
Joram, in the invasion of the Philistines and Arabians. They must be
brothers only in the wider sense, i.e., cousins and nephews of Ahaziah,
as Movers (S. 258) and Ewald recognise, along with the older
commentators. The Chronicle, therefore, is quite correct in saying,
"sons of the brethren of Ahaziah," and along with these princes of
Judah, who, according to the context, can only be princes who held
offices at court, especially such as were entrusted with the education
and guardianship of the royal princes. Perhaps these are included in the
number forty-two (Kings). But even if this be not the case, we need not
suppose that there were forty-two brothers' sons, or nephews of Ahaziah,
since אחים includes cousins also, and in the text of the Chronicle no
number is stated, although forty-two nephews would not be an unheard-of
number; and we do not know how many elder brothers Ahaziah had.
Certainly the nephews or brothers' sons of Ahaziah cannot have been very
old, since Ahaziah's father Joram died at the age of forty, and Ahaziah,
who became king in his twenty-second year, reigned only one year. But
from the early development of posterity in southern lands, and the
polygamy practised by the royal princes, Joram might easily have had in
his fortieth year a considerable number of grandsons from five to eight
years old, and boys of from six to nine years might quite well make a
journey with their tutors to Jezreel to visit their relations. In this
way the divergent statements as to the slaughter of the brothers and
brothers' sons of Ahaziah, contained in 2 Kings 9 and in our [Ch2
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#008.md), may be reconciled, without our
being compelled, as Berth. thinks we are, to suppose that there were two
different traditions on this subject.

[Ch2 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009.md)

And he (Jehu) sought Ahaziah, and they (Jehu's body-guard or his
warriors) caught him while he was hiding in Samaria, and brought him to
Jehu, and slew him. Then they (his servants, [Kg2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027).md) buried him, for they said: He is
a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jahve with all his heart. We find more
exact information as to Ahaziah's death in [Kg2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027.md)., according to which Ahaziah,
overtaken by Jehu near Jibleam in his flight before him, and smitten,
i.e., wounded, fled to Megiddo, and there died, and was brought by his
servants to Jerusalem, and buried with his fathers in the city of David.
For the reconciliation of these statements, see on [Kg2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027.md). The circumstance that in our
account first the slaughter of the brothers' sons, then that of Ahaziah
is mentioned, while according to 2 Kings 9 and 10 the slaughter of
Ahaziah would seem to have preceded, does not make any essential
difference; for the short account in the Chronicle is not arranged
chronologically, but according to the subject, and the death of Ahaziah
is mentioned last only in order that it might be connected with the
further events which occurred in Judah. The last clause of [Ch2
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009.md), "and there was not to the house
of Ahab one who would have possessed power for the kingdom," i.e., there
was no successor on the throne to whom the government might straightway
be transferred, forms a transition to the succeeding account of
Athaliah's usurpation.

[2 Chronicles 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 22:10</span></span>

The six years' tyranny of Athaliah. - In regard to her, all that is
stated is, that after Ahaziah's death she ascended the throne, and
caused all the royal seed of the house of Judah, i.e., all the male
members of the royal house, to be murdered. From this slaughter only
Joash the son of Ahaziah, an infant a year old, was rescued, together
with his nurse, by the princess Jehoshabeath, who was married to the
high priest Jehoiada. He was hidden for six years, and during that time
Athaliah reigned. The same narrative, for the most part in the same
words, is found in [Kg2 11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001.md), and
has been already commented upon there.
