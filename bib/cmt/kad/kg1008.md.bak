### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 8:1</span></span>

This solemn transaction consisted of three parts, and the chapter
arranges itself in three sections accordingly: viz., (a) the conveyance
of the ark and the tabernacle, together with its vessels, into the
temple, with the words spoken by Solomon on the occasion (vv. 1-21); (b)
Solomon's dedicatory prayer (vv. 22-53); (c) the blessing of the
congregation, and the offering of sacrifice and observance of a feast
([Kg1 8:54-66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054).md). - The parallel account
to this in 2 Chron 5:2-7:10, in addition to certain minor alterations of
words and constructions, introduced for the most part merely for the
sake of elucidation, contains here and there, and more especially
towards the end, a few deviations of greater extent, partly omissions
and partly additions. But in other respects it agrees almost word for
word with our account.

With regard to the time of the dedication, it is merely stated in [Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md) that the heads of the nation
assembled at Jerusalem to this feast in the seventh month. The year in
which this took place is not given. But as the building of the temple
was finished, according to [Kg1 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038.md),
in the eighth month of the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, the
dedication which followed in the seventh month cannot have taken place
in the same year as the completion of the building. Ewald's opinion,
that Solomon dedicated the building a month before it was finished, is
not only extremely improbable in itself, but is directly at variance
with [Kg1 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051.md). If we add to this,
that according to [Kg1 9:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001.md) it was
not till after the lapse of twenty years, during which he had built the
two houses, the temple, and his palace, that the Lord appeared to
Solomon at the dedication of the temple and promised to answer his
prayer, we must decide in favour of the view held by Thenius, that the
dedication of the temple did not take place till twenty years after the
building of it was begun, or thirteen years after it was finished, and
when Solomon had also completed the building of the palace, which
occupied thirteen years, as the lxx have indicated at the commencement
of [Kg1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001.md) by the interpolation of
the words, καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς συνετέλεσε Σαλωμὼν τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον
Κυρίου καὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ μετὰ εἴκοσι ἔτη.

(Note: From the whole character of the Alexandrian version, there can be
no doubt that these words have been transferred by the lxx from [Kg1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001.md), and have not dropped out of the
Hebrew text, as Thenius supposes.)

1 Kings 8:1-21

The First Act of the solemnities consisted (1) in the removal of the ark
of the covenant into the Most Holy Place of the temple ([Kg1
8:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001)); and (2.md) in the words with
which Solomon celebrated the entrance of the Lord into the new temple
([Kg1 8:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012).md).

[Kg1 8:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001.md)

Removal of the ark of the covenant into the temple. - This solemn
transaction was founded entirely upon the solemnities with which the ark
was conveyed in the time of David from the house of Obed-edom into the
holy tent upon Zion ([Sa2 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012.md).; [Ch1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#002)..md). Solomon assembled the elders
of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers'
houses (האבות נשׂיאי, contracted from האבות בּית נשׂיאי) of the
Israelites, as representatives of the whole congregation, to himself at
Jerusalem, to bring the ark of the covenant out of the city of David,
i.e., from Mount Zion (see the Comm. on [Sa2
6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016).md), into the temple which he had
built upon Moriah. (On the use of the contracted form of the imperfect
יקהל after אז, see Ewald, 233, b.)

[Kg1 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md)

Accordingly "all the men of Israel (i.e., the heads of the tribes and
families mentioned in [Kg1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001).md)
assembled together to the king in the month Ethanim, i.e., the seventh
month, at the feast." Gesenius explains the name האתנים (in 55 codd.
האיתנים) as meaning "month of the flowing brooks," after איתן in [Pro
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#015.md); Bttcher, on the other hand,
supposes it to denote the equinox. But apart from other grounds, the
plural by no means favours this. Nor does the seventh month answer to
the period between the middle of our September and the middle of
October, as is supposed by Thenius, who founds upon this supposition the
explanation already rejected by Bttcher, viz., "month of gifts;" but it
corresponds to the period between the new moon of October and the new
moon of November, during which the rainy season commences in Palestine
(Rob. Pal. ii. p. 96ff.), so that this month may very well have received
its name from the constant flowing of the brooks. The explanation, "that
is the seventh month," is added, however (here as in [Kg1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md), [Kg1
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038).md), not because the arrangement of
the months was a different one before the captivity (Thenius), but
because different names came into use for the months during the
captivity. בּחג is construed with the article: "because the feast
intended was one that was well known, and had already been kept for a
long time (viz., the feast of tabernacles)." The article overthrows the
explanation given by Thenius, who supposes that the reference is to the
festivities connected with the dedication of the temple itself.

[Kg1 8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#003.md)

After the arrival of all the elders (i.e., of the representatives of the
nation, more particularly described in [Kg1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001).md), the priests carried the ark and
brought it up (sc., into the temple), with the tabernacle and all the
holy vessels in it. The expression אתם ויּעלוּ, which follows,
introduces as a supplementary notice, according to the general
diffuseness of the early Hebrew style of narrative, the more precise
statement that the priests and Levites brought up these sacred vessels.
מועד אהל is not the tent erected for the ark of the covenant upon Zion,
which can be proved to have been never so designated, and which is
expressly distinguished from the former in [Ch2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#004.md) as compared with [Kg1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#003.md), but is the Mosaic tabernacle at
Gibeon in front of which Solomon had offered sacrifice ([Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004).md). The tabernacle with the vessels
in it, to which, however, the ark of the covenant, that had long been
separated from it, did not belong, was probably preserved as a sacred
relic in the rooms above the Most Holy Place. The ark of the covenant
was carried by priests on all solemn occasions, according to the spirit
of the law, which enjoined, in [Num
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031.md) and [Num
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005.md)., that the ark of the covenant and
the rest of the sacred vessels should be carried by the Levites, after
the priests had carefully wrapped them up; and the Levites were
prohibited from directly touching them, on pain of death. When,
therefore, the ark of the covenant was carried in solemn procession, as
in the case before us, probably uncovered, this could only be done by
the priests, more especially as the Levites were not allowed to enter
the Most Holy Place. Consequently, by the statement in [Kg1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#003.md), that the priests and Levites
carried them (אתם), viz., the objects mentioned before, we are to
understand that the ark of the covenant was carried into the temple by
the priests, and the tabernacle with its vessels by the Levites.

(Note: Instead of כּהנים in [Kg1 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#003.md),
we have הלּויּם in [Ch2 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#004.md); and
instead of והלּויּם הכּהנים in [Kg1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#004.md), we have הלּויּם הכּהנים, "the
Levitical priests." These variations are to be attributed to inexactness
in expression. For it is obvious that Thenius is wrong in his notion
that the chronicler mentioned the Levites instead of the priests, from
the simple fact that he states in [Kg1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#007.md) that "the priests carried the
ark," etc., in exact agreement with our account.)

[Kg1 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#005.md)

"And king Solomon and the whole congregation, that had gathered round
him, were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen in
innumerable multitude." This took place while the ark of the covenant
was carried up, no doubt when it was brought into the court of the
temple, and was set down there for a time either within or in front of
the hall. Then was this magnificent sacrifice "offered" there "in front
of the ark" (הארון לפני).

[Kg1 8:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#006.md)

After this sacrificing was ended, the priests carried the ark to its
place, into the back-room of the house, into the Most Holy under the
wings of the cherubim (already described in [Kg1
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#023)..md). The latter statement is
explained in [Kg1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#007.md). "For the
cherubim were spreading out wings towards the place of the ark, and so
covered (lit., threw a shade) over the ark and over its poles from
above." If the outspread wings of the great cherubic figures threw a
shade not only over the ark of the covenant, but also over its poles,
the ark was probably so placed that the poles ran from north to south,
and not from east to west, as they are sketched in my Archologie.

[Kg1 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008.md)

"And the poles were long, and there were seen their heads (i.e., they
were so long that their heads were seen) from the Holy Place before the
hinder room; but on the outside (outside the Holy Place, say in the
porch) they were not seen." יאכוּ cannot be rendered: they had
lengthened the poles, from which Kimchi and others have inferred that
they had made new and longer carrying-poles, since the form of the tense
in this connection cannot be the pluperfect, and in that case, moreover
the object would be indicated by את as in [Kg1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014.md); but האריך is used
intransitively, "to be long," lit., to show length, as in [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md); [Deu
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#016.md), etc. The remark to the effect
that the poles were visible, indicates that the precept of the law in
[Exo 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015.md), according to which the
poles were to be left in the ark, was observed in Solomon's temple also.
Any one could convince himself of this, for the poles were there "to
this day." The author of our books has retained this chronological
allusion as he found it in his original sources; for when he composed
his work, the temple was no longer standing. It is impossible, however,
to ascertain from this statement how the heads of the poles could be
seen in the Holy Place, - whether from the fact that they reached the
curtain and formed elevations therein, if the poles ran from front to
back; or whether, if, as is more probable, they ran from south to north,
the front heads were to be seen, simply when the curtain was drawn back.

(Note: The proof which Thenius has endeavoured to give by means of a
drawing of the correctness of the latter view, is founded upon untenable
assumptions (see Bttcher, Aehrenl. ii. p. 69). It by no means follows
from the expression דביר על־פּני that the heads of the poles were
visible as far off as the door of the Holy Place, but simply that they
could be seen in the Holy Place, though not outside.)

[Kg1 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009.md)

"There was nothing in the ark but the two tables of stone, which Moses
had put there at Horeb, when Jehovah concluded the covenant with
Israel." The intention of this remark is also simply to show that the
law, which enjoined that the ark should merely preserve the stone tables
of the covenant ([Exo 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016.md); [Exo
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#020).md), had not been departed from in
the lapse of time. אשׁר before כּרת is not a pronoun, but a conjunction:
when, from the time that, as in [Deu
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006.md), etc. כּרת without בּרית,
signifying the conclusion of a covenant, as in [Sa1
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#016.md); [Sa1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#008.md), etc. Horeb, the general name for
the place where the law was given, instead of the more definite name
Sinai, as in Deuteronomy (see the Comm. on [Exo
19:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001).md).

(Note: The statement in [Heb 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004.md), to
the effect that the pot of manna and Aaron's rod that budded were also
to be found in the ark, which is at variance with this verse, and which
the earlier commentators endeavoured to bring into harmony with it by
forced methods of different kinds, simply rests upon an erroneous
interpretation of העדוּת לפני in [Exo
16:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#033.md), and [Num
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010.md), which had become traditional
among the Jews; since this merely affirms that the objects mentioned had
been deposited in front of the testimony, i.e., in front of the ark
which contained the testimony, and not within it, as the Jews supposed.
- Still less are De Wette and others warranted in deducing from this
verse an argument against the existence of the Mosaic book of the law in
the time of Solomon, inasmuch as, according to the precept in [Deu
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026.md), the book of the law was not to
be kept in the ark, but by the side of it, or near it.)

[Kg1 8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md)

At the dedication of the tabernacle the glory of Jehovah in the cloud
filled the sanctuary, so that Moses could not enter ([Exo
40:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034).md); and so was it now. When the
priests came out of the sanctuary, after putting the ark of the covenant
in its place, the cloud filled the house of Jehovah, so that the priests
could not stand to minister. The signification of this fact was the same
on both occasions. The cloud, as the visible symbol of the gracious
presence of God, filled the temple, as a sign that Jehovah the
covenant-God had entered into it, and had chosen it as the scene of His
gracious manifestation in Israel. By the inability of the priests to
stand, we are not to understand that the cloud drove them away; for it
was not till the priests had come out that it filled the temple. It
simply means that they could not remain in the Holy Place to perform
service, say to offer an incense-offering upon the altar to consecrate
it, just as sacrifices were offered upon the altar of burnt-offering
after the dedicatory prayer ([Kg1
8:62](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062.md), [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063).md).

(Note: Bertheau's opinion (on [Ch2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014).md), that the priests could not
remain in the hall and in front of it on account of the cloud, namely,
"the cloud of smoke, which, ascending from the sacrifices burned upon
the altar of burnt-offering, concealed the glory of the Lord," is
decidedly erroneous. For the cloud which hindered the priest from
performing the service was, according to the distinct words of the text,
the cloud which filled the house; and the explanatory clause, "for the
glory of the Lord filled the house of Jehovah," indicates in the most
unmistakeable terms that it was the vehicle of the glory of God, and
therefore was no a cloud of smoke formed by the burning sacrifices, but
the cloud in which God manifested His invisible being to His people, -
the very same cloud in which Jehovah was to appear above the Capporeth,
when the high priest entered the Most Holy Place on the day of
atonement, so that he was commanded not to enter it at all times, and,
when he entered, to cover the Capporeth with the cloud of the burning
incense ([Lev 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md), [Lev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#013).md).

The glory of the Lord, which is like a consuming fire ([Exo
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#017.md); [Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md); [Deu
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#003).md), before which unholy man cannot
stand, manifested itself in the cloud. This marvellous manifestation of
the glory of God took place only at the dedication; after that the cloud
was only visible in the Most Holy Place on the great day of atonement,
when the high priest entered it. - The Chronicles contain a long account
at this place of the playing and singing of the Levites at these
solemnities (vid., [Ch2 5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012).md).

[Kg1 8:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012.md)

Solomon extols this marvellous proof of the favour of the Lord. - [Kg1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012.md). Then spake Solomon, "Jehovah
hath spoken to dwell in the darkness." "Solomon saw that the temple was
filled with a cloud, and remembered that God had been pleased to appear
in a cloud in the tent of Moses also. Hence he assuredly believed that
God was in this cloud also, and that, as formerly He had filled the
tabernacle, so He would now fill the temple and dwell therein" (Seb.
Schmidt). וגו יהוה אמר, which Thenius still renders incorrectly, "the
Lord intends to dwell in the darkness," refers, as Rashi, C. a Lap., and
others have seen, to the utterances of God in the Pentateuch concerning
the manifestation of His gracious presence among His people, not merely
to [Lev 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md) (I will appear in the
cloud), but also to [Exo 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009.md), where
the Lord said to Moses, "I come to thee הענן בּעב," and still more to
[Exo 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#021.md) and [Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011.md); [Deu
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#019.md), according to which God came down
upon Sinai בּערפל. Solomon took the word ערפל from these passages. That
he meant by this the black, dark cloud which filled the temple, is
perfectly obvious from the combination והערפל הענן in [Deu
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#019.md) and [Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011.md).

(Note: Thenius, however, has built up all kinds of untenable conjectures
as to alterations of the text, upon the erroneous assumption that ענן
means the light and radiant cloud, and cannot be synonymous with ערפל.
Bttcher adopts the same opinion, without taking any notice of the
striking remarks of Bertheau on [Ch2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014)..md)

Solomon saw this word of Jehovah realized in the filling of the temple
with the cloud, and learned therefrom that the Lord would dwell in this
temple. Hence, being firmly convinced of the presence of Jehovah in the
cloud which filled the sanctuary, he adds in [Kg1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#013.md) : "I have built Thee a house to
dwell in, a place for Thy seat for ever." We are not to understand
עולמים as signifying that Solomon believed that the temple built by him
would stand for ever; but it is to be explained partly from the contrast
to the previous abode of God in the tabernacle, which from the very
nature of the case could only be a temporary one, inasmuch as a tent,
such as the tabernacle was, is not only a moveable and provisional
dwelling, but also a very perishable one, and partly from the promise
given to David in [Sa2 7:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md), that
the Lord would establish the throne of his kingdom for his seed for
ever. This promise involved the eternal duration of the gracious
connection between God and Israel, which was embodied in the dwelling of
God in the temple. This connection, from its very nature, was an eternal
one; even if the earthly form, from which Solomon at that moment
abstracted himself, was temporal and perishable. - Solomon had spoken
these words with his face turned to the Most Holy Place. He then ([Kg1
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014).md) turned his face to the
congregation, which was standing in the court, and blessed it. The word
"blessed" (יברך) denotes the wish for a blessing with which the king
greeted the assembled congregation, and introduced the praise of God
which follows. - In [Kg1 8:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#015.md) he
praises the Lord for having now fulfilled with His hand what He spake
with His mouth to his father David (2 Sam 7).

[Kg1 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#016.md)

The promise of God, to choose Jerusalem as the place for the temple and
David as prince, is taken freely from [Sa2
7:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#007.md). In [Ch2
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#006.md), before "I chose David," we find
"and I chose Jerusalem, that my name might be there;" so that the
affirmation answers more precisely to the preceding negation, whereas in
the account before us this middle term is omitted.

[Kg1 8:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#017.md)

David's intention to build the temple, and the answer of God that his
son was to execute this work, are so far copied from [Sa2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002.md), [Sa2
7:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md), that God approves the
intention of David as such. הטיבת, "Thou didst well that it was in thy
mind."

[Kg1 8:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#020.md)

"And Jehovah has set up His word." וגו ויּקם supplies the explanation of
בידו מלּא (hath fulfilled with his hand) in [Kg1
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#015.md). God had caused Solomon to take
possession of the throne of David; and Solomon had built the temple and
prepared a place there for the ark of the covenant. The ark is thereby
declared to be the kernel and star of the temple, because it was the
throne of the glory of God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 8:22</span></span>

Second Act of the feast of dedication: Solomon's dedicatory prayer (cf.
2 Chron 6:12-42). - [Kg1 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022.md). "Then
Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the assembly
of Israel, and stretched out his hands towards heaven." It is evident
from [Kg1 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054.md) that Solomon uttered
the prayer which follows upon his knees. The Chronicles contain the same
account as we have here, with this addition, that it is said to have
taken place on a "scaffold," or kind of pulpit (כּיּור) specially
erected for the purpose.

(Note: Bttcher is right in his assertion, that the opinion expressed by
Thenius and Cappellus, that this passage in the Chronicles has been
dropped out of our text through a copyist's oversight, is a very
improbable one; although the reasons he assigns are for the most part
untenable. The omission may be explained in a very simple manner, from
the fact that the introduction of this circumstance had no bearing upon
the design or contents of the dedicatory prayer.)

The altar, to the front of which Solomon went, was the altar of
burnt-offering in the court, where the congregation was gathered
together. The expression ישׂ כּל־קהל נגד favours the idea that Solomon
offered the prayer upon his knees with his face turned towards the
congregation, and not with his back to the people and his face turned
towards the temple, as Thenius supposes. - The substance of the prayer
is closely connected with the prayer of Moses, especially with the
blessings and curses therein (vid., Lev 26 and Deut 28). Commencing with
the praise of God, who "keepeth covenant and truth" towards His
servants, and has thus far performed to His servant David the promise
that He gave him ([Kg1 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#023.md), [Kg1
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#024).md), Solomon entreats the Lord still
further to fulfil this promise of His ([Kg1
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025.md), [Kg1
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#026).md), and to keep His eyes constantly
open over the temple, to hearken to the prayers of His people, and to
avert the curse threatened against sinners from all who shall call upon
Him in this temple (vv. 27-53).

[Kg1 8:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#023.md)

By granting the blessing promised to His people, the Lord has hitherto
proved Himself to be the true and only God in heaven and on earth, who
keepeth covenant and mercy with those who walk before Him with all their
heart. This acknowledgment provides the requisite confidence for
offering the prayer which is sure of an answer ([Mat
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#022.md); [Mar
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024.md); [Jam
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006).md). For אל אין־כּמוך, compare [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md) with [Deu
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#039.md); [Sa2
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#022.md); [Sa2
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#032.md); [Psa
86:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008.md). "Who keepeth covenant and
mercy," verbatim the same as in [Deu
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009.md). The promise given to His servant
David (2 Sam 7), the fulfilment of which the commencement now lay before
their eyes (cf. [Kg1 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#020.md), [Kg1
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#021).md), was an emanation from the
covenant faithfulness of God. "As it is this day," as in [Kg1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006.md).

[Kg1 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025.md)

The expression "and now" (ועתּה) introduces the prayer for the further
fulfilment of the promise, never to allow a successor upon the throne to
be wanting to David, in the same conditional form in which David had
uttered the hope in [Kg1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004.md), and in
which the Lord had renewed the promise to Solomon during the building of
the temple ([Kg1 6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#012).md). In על־כּסּא
ישׁב מלּפני, instead of כּסּא מעל in [Kg1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004.md), the divine rejection is more
distinctly indicated.

[Kg1 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#026.md)

[Kg1 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#026.md) is not merely a repetition
of the prayer in [Kg1 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025.md), as Thenius
supposes, but forms the introduction to the prayers which follow for the
hearing of all the prayer presented before the Lord in the temple. The
words, "let Thy words be verified, which Thou spakest unto Thy servant
David," contain something more than a prayer for the continual
preservation of the descendants of David upon the throne, for the
fulfilment of which Solomon prayed in [Kg1
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025.md). They refer to the whole of the
promise in [Sa2 7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md). The plural
דּבריך (Chethb) points back to כּל־הדּברים in [Sa2
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#017.md), and is not to be altered into
the singular after the Keri. The singular יאמן is used as it frequently
is with the subject in the plural, when the verb precedes (cf. Ewald.
316, a., 1). Solomon has here in mind one particular point in the
promise, viz., that God would not withdraw His mercy from the seed of
David, even when it sinned. This is evident from what follows, where he
mentions simply cases of transgression, and prays that they may be
forgiven.

[Kg1 8:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027.md)

[Kg1 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#026.md) are closely connected in
this sense: keep Thy words that were spoken to David; for although this
temple cannot hold Thine infinite divine nature, I know that Thou wilt
have respect to the prayer of Thy servant, to keep Thine eyes open over
this temple, to hear every prayer which Thy people shall bring before
Thee therein. וּפנית in [Kg1 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#028.md)
continues the optative נא יאמן in [Kg1
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#026.md); and [Kg1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027.md) contains an intermediate thought,
with which Solomon meets certain contracted ideas of the gracious
presence of God in the temple. כּי ([Kg1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027).md) signifies neither but,
nevertheless, atque (Bttcher), nor "as" (Thenius, Bertheau); and the
assertion that [Kg1 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027.md) is the
commencement of a new section is overthrown by the inadmissible
rendering of וּפנית, "but Thou turnest Thyself" (Thenius). - With the
words, "Should God really dwell upon the earth! behold, the heaven and
the heaven of heavens (i.e., the heavens in their widest extent, cf.
[Deu 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#014).md) cannot contain Thee, to
say nothing (כּי אף; cf. Ewald, 354, c.) of this house which I have
built," in which the infinitude of God and His exaltation above the
world are expressed as clearly and forcibly as possible, Solomon does
not intend to guard against the delusion that God really dwells in
temples (J. D. Mich.), but simply to meet the erroneous idea that He
dwells in the temple as men dwell in a house, namely, shut up within it,
and not also outside and above it, - a delusion which sometimes forced
its way into the unspiritual nation but which was always attacked by the
prophets (cf. [Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md); [Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004), etc..md). For it is evident that
Solomon did combine with his clear perception of the infinite exaltation
of God a firm belief in His real presence in the temple, and did not do
homage to the abstract idealism of the rationalists, not merely from his
declaration in [Kg1 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012.md). that he had
built this temple as a dwelling-place for God, but also from the
substance of all the following prayers, and primarily from the general
prayer in [Kg1 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#028.md), [Kg1
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029.md), that God would take this temple
under His special protection, and hearken to every prayer directed
towards it. The distinction between תּפלּה, תּחנּה, and רנּה is the
following: תּפלּה denotes prayer in general, praise, supplication, and
thanksgiving; תּחנּה, supplication or entreaty, prayer for help and
mercy; and רנּה, jubilation, prayer as the joyous utterance of praise
and thanksgiving.

[Kg1 8:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029.md)

"That Thine eyes may be open upon this house night and day." אל־הבּית,
speciali quadam providentia in hanc domum directi (Mich.). The following
clause, "upon the place of which Thou hast said, My name shall be there"
(namely, [Sa2 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013), implicite.md),
contains within itself the ground upon which the prayer rests. Because
the name of God will be in the temple, i.e., because God will manifest
His gracious presence there, He will also keep His eyes open upon it, so
as to hear the prayer of Solomon directed towards it. הזּה המּקום אל
(toward this place): because Solomon also was prayer in the court
towards the temple. - In [Kg1 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030.md),
"and hear the supplication of Thy servant and of Thy people Israel," he
begins by asking that those prayers may be heard which the king and
people shall henceforth bring before God in the temple. ושׁמעתּ
corresponds to וּפנית in [Kg1 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#028.md),
and is more precisely defined by the following תּשׁמע ואתּה (as for
these prayers), Thou wilt hear them up to the place of Thine abode, to
heaven. אל שׁמע is a pregnant expression: to hear the prayer, which
ascends to heaven. In the Chronicles we find throughout the explanatory
מן. The last words, "hear and forgive," must be left in their general
form, and not limited by anything to be supplied. Nothing but
forgiveness of sin can remove the curse by which transgression is
followed.

This general prayer is then particularized from [Kg1
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#031.md) onwards by the introduction of
seven special petitions for an answer in the different cases in which,
in future, prayers may be offered to God in the temple. The first prayer
([Kg1 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#031.md), [Kg1
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#032).md) has reference to the oaths sworn
in the temple, the sanctity of which God is asked to protect. "If a man
sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him, to cause him to
swear, and he come (and) swear before the altar in this house, then wilt
Thou hear," etc. אשׁר את does not mean either "granted that" (Thenius)
or "just when" (Ewald, 533, a.), although אם is used in the Chronicles,
and we might render it freely "when;" but את is simply an accusative
particle, serving to introduce the following clause, in the sense of "as
for," or "with regard to (such a case as) that a man sins" (vid., Ewald,
277, a.). אלה וּבא cannot be taken as anything but an asyndeton. For if
אלה were a substantive, it would have the article (האלה) provided it
were the subject, and the verb would be written בּאה; and if it were the
object, we should have בּאלה, as in [Neh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#030.md) (cf. [Eze
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013).md). The prayer refers to the cases
mentioned in [Exo 22:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#006.md) and [Lev
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#017.md), when property entrusted to any
one had been lost or injured, or when a thing had been found and the
finding was denied, or when an act of fraud had been committed; in which
cases the law required not only compensation with the addition of a
fifth of its value, but also a trespass-offering as an expiation of the
sin committed by taking a false oath. But as this punishment could only
be inflicted when the guilty person afterwards confessed his guilt, many
false oaths might have been sworn in the cases in question and have
remained unpunished, so far as men were concerned. Solomon therefore
prays that the Lord will hear every such oath that shall have been sworn
before the altar, and work (עשׂית), i.e., actively interpose, and judge
His servants, to punish the guilty and justify the innocent. The
construction השּׁמים תּשׁמע ([Kg1
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#032.md), [Kg1
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#034.md), [Kg1
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#036), etc..md) can be explained more
simply from the adverbial use of the accusative (Ewald, 300, b.), than
from השּׁמים אל in [Kg1 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030.md). בּראשׁו
דּרכּו תּת, to give (bring) his way upon his head, i.e., to cause the
merited punishment to fall upon him (cf. [Eze
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#010.md); [Eze
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#021), etc..md). רשׁע הרשׁרע and צדּיק
הצדּיק recall [Deu 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#002.md). For כּצדקתו
לו תּת compare [Sa2 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#021.md), [Sa2
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#025.md). - The following cases are all
taken from Lev 26 and Deut 28.

[Kg1 8:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#033.md)

The second petition, - "If Thy people Israel are smitten by the enemy,
because they have sinned against Thee, and they turn to Thee and confess
Thy name, ... then hear ... and bring them back into the land," - refers
to the threatenings in [Lev 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#017.md) and
[Deu 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025.md), where the nation is
threatened with defeat and subjugation on the part of enemies, who shall
invade the land, in which case prisoners of war are carried away into
foreign lands, but the mass of the people remain in the land, so that
they who are beaten can pray to the Lord in the temple, that He will
forgive them their sin, save them out of the power of the enemy, and
bring back the captives and fugitives into their fatherland.

[Kg1 8:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#035.md)

The third prayer refers to the remission of the punishment of drought
threatened against the land, when the heaven is shut up, according to
[Lev 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md); [Deu
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017.md); [Deu
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023.md). תענם כּי, because Thou humblest
them (lxx, Vulg.); not "that Thou hearest them" (Chald. and others).
תורם כּי, because Thou teachest them the good way. These words
correspond to כי תענם, and contain a motive for forgiveness. Because God
teaches His people and seeks by means of chastisements to bring them
back to the good way when they fail to keep His commandments, He must
forgive when they recognise the punishment as a divine chastisement and
come to Him with penitential prayer.

[Kg1 8:37-40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#037.md)

The fourth prayer relates to the removal of other land-plagues: famine
([Lev 26:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md), and [Lev
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md); [Deu
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023).md); pestilence ([Lev
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#025).md); blight and mildew in the corn
([Deu 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#022).md); locusts (חסיל, devourer,
is connected with ארבּה without a copula, - in the Chronicles by Vv, -
to depict the plague of locusts more vividly before their eyes after
[Deu 28:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#038).md); oppression by enemies in
their own land; lastly, plagues and diseases of all kinds, such as are
threatened against the rebellious in [Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md) and [Deu
28:59-61](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#059.md). יצר is not the imperfect Kal
of צוּר (Ges., Dietr., Frst, Olsh. Gramm. p. 524), but the imperfect
Hiphil of הצר in [Deu 28:52](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#052.md), as in
[Neh 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#027.md); and the difficult
expression שׁעריו בּארץ is probably to be altered into שׁ בּארץ, whilst
שׁעריו is either to be taken as a second object to יצר, as Luther
supposes, or as in apposition to בּארץ, in the land (in) his gates, as
Bertheau assumes. The assertion of Thenius, that all the versions except
the Vulgate are founded upon the reading עריו בּעחת, is incorrect. יהיה
כּי is omitted after kaal-machalaah, since Solomon dropped the
construction with which he commenced, and therefore briefly summed up
all the prayers, addressed to God under the various chastisements here
named, in the expression כּל־תּחנּה כּל־תּפלּה, which is placed
absolutely at the opening of [Kg1
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#038.md). וגו ידעוּן אשׁר, "when they
perceive each one the stroke of his heart," i.e., not dolor animi quem
quisque sentit (Vatab., C. a Lap.), but the plague regarded as a blow
falling upon the heart, in other words, as a chastisement inflicted upon
him by God. In all these cases may God hear his prayer, and do and give
to every one according to his way. תּדע אשׁר, "as Thou knowest his
heart," i.e., as is profitable for every one according to the state of
his heart of his disposition. God can do this, because He knows the
hearts of all men (cf. [Jer 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010).md).
The purpose assigned for all this hearing of prayer ([Kg1
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#040).md), viz., "that they may fear
Thee," etc., is the same as in [Deu
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010.md).

[Kg1 8:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#041.md)

The fifth prayer has reference to the hearing of the prayers of
foreigners, who shall pray in the temple. Solomon assumes as certain
that foreigners will come and worship before Jehovah in His temple; even
Moses himself had allowed the foreigners living among the Israelites to
offer sacrifice at the temple ([Num
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#014)..md), and the great name and the
arm of the Lord, that had manifested itself in deeds of omnipotence, had
become known in the times of Moses to the surrounding nations ([Exo
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014.md); [Exo
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001.md); [Jos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001).md), and the report of this had
reached Balaam even in Mesopotamia (see the Comm. on Num 22). הנּכרי אל
does not mean "as for the foreigners" (Thenius), for אל is never used in
this sense; but it is to be connected with תּשׁמע in [Kg1
8:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#043.md), as אל שׁמע frequently occurs
(Bertheau).

[Kg1 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#042.md)

[Kg1 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#042.md) is a parenthesis inserted in
explanation of שׁמך למען: "for they will hear," etc. The strong hand and
the outstretched arm are connected together as a standing expression for
the wondrous manifestations of the divine omnipotence in the guidance of
Israel, as in [Deu 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md); [Deu
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015.md), etc. With והתפּלּל וּבא the מארץ
וּבא in [Kg1 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#041.md) is resumed, and the
main thought continued.

[Kg1 8:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#043.md)

The reason for the hearing of the prayers of foreigners is "that all
nations may know Thy name to fear Thee," etc., as in [Deu
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#010.md). An examination of this original
passage, from which וגו על נקרא שׁמך כּי is taken and transferred to the
temple, shows that the common explanations of this phrase, viz., "that
this house is called after Thy name," or "that Thy name is invoked over
this temple (at its dedication)," are erroneous. The name of the Lord is
always used in the Scriptures to denote the working of God among His
people or in His kingdom (see at [Sa2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002).md). The naming of this name over the
nation, the temple, etc., presupposes the working of God within it, and
denotes the confession and acknowledgment of that working. This is
obvious from such passages as [Jer
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009.md), where the expression "Thy name
is called over us" is only a further explanation of the word "Thou art
in the midst of us;" and from [Isa
63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019.md), where "we are they over whom
Thou hast not ruled from eternity" is equivalent to "over whom Thy name
has not been called." The name of Jehovah will be named over the temple,
when Jehovah manifests His gracious presence within it in such a manner,
that the nations who pray towards it experience the working of the
living God within His sanctuary. It is in this sense that it is stated
in [Sa2 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md) that the name of Jehovah
is named above the ark of the covenant (see the Comm. in loc.). - There
are no cases on record of the worship of foreigners in connection with
Solomon's temple, though there are in connection with the temple built
after the captivity (vid., Josephus, Ant. xi. 8, 5, that of Alexander
the Great; xii. 2, 5ff., that of Ptolemaeus Philadelphus; and 2 Macc.
3:2, 3, that of Seleucus).

[Kg1 8:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#044.md)

Finally, in [Kg1 8:44-50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#044.md) Solomon also
asks, that when prayers are directed towards the temple by those who are
far away both from Jerusalem and the temple, they may be heard. The
sixth case, in [Kg1 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#044.md), [Kg1
8:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#045.md), is, if Israel should be engaged
in war with an enemy by the appointment of God; and the seventh, in [Kg1
8:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046.md), is, if it should be carried
away by enemies on account of its sins.

(Note: Bertheau (on Chron.) has already proved that there is no force in
the arguments by which Thenius attempts to show, on doctrinal grounds,
that [Kg1 8:44-51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#044.md) are an interpolated
addition. As he correctly observes, "it is, on the contrary, quite in
harmony with the original plan, that the two cases are also anticipated,
in which the prayers of Israelites who are at a distance from the seat
of the sanctuary are directed towards the temple, since it is perfectly
appropriate that the prayers of the Israelites at the place of the
sanctuary are mentioned first, then the prayers of foreigners at the
same place, and lastly the prayers of Israelites, who, because they are
not in Jerusalem, are obliged to content themselves with turning their
faces towards the temple. We might also point to the fact that it is
probably intentional that exactly seven cases are enumerated, inasmuch
as in enumerations of this kind, which are not restricted by the nature
of the case to any definite measure, such a number as seven easily
furnishes an outward limit," - or more correctly: because seven as a
sacred or covenant number was more appropriate than any other to embrace
all prayers addressed to God.)

By the expression in [Kg1 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#044.md), "in
the way which Thou sendest them," the war is described as one undertaken
by the direction of God, whether wages against an enemy who has invaded
the land, or outside the land of Canaan for the chastisement of the
heathen dwelling around them. "And shall pray וגו העיר דּרך:" i.e., in
the direction towards the chosen city and the temple, namely, in faith
in the actual presence of the covenant God in the temple. יהוה אל, "to
Jehovah," instead of "to Thee," is probably introduced for the sake of
greater clearness. משׁפּטם ועשׂית, and secure them justice (cf. [Deu
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018.md); [Psa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005), etc..md).

[Kg1 8:46-49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046.md)

In the seventh prayer, viz., if Israel should be given up to its enemies
on account of its sins and carried away into the land of the enemy,
Solomon had the threat in [Lev 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033.md),
[Lev 26:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#044.md) in his eye, though he does
not confine his prayer to the exile of the whole nation foretold in that
passage and in [Deu 28:45](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#045.md)., [Deu
28:64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064.md), and [Deu
30:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md), but extends it to every case
of transportation to an enemy's land. לבּם אל והשׁיבוּ, "and they take
it to heart," compare [Deu 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#039.md), and
without the object, [Deu 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md); not
"they feel remorse," as Thenius supposes, because the Hiphil cannot have
this reflective signification (Bttcher). The confession of sin in [Kg1
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#047.md), רשׁענוּ והעוינוּ חטאנוּ, was
adopted by the Jews when in captivity as the most exhaustive expression
of their deep consciousness of guilt ([Dan
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005.md); [Psa
106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006).md). חטא, to slip, labi, depicts
sin as a wandering from right; העוה, to act perversely, as a conscious
perversion of justice; and רשׁע as a passionate rebellion against God
(cf. [Isa 57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020).md).

[Kg1 8:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#050.md)

לרחמים וּנתתּם: literally, "and make (place) them for compassion before
their captors, that they may have compassion upon them," i.e., cause
them to meet with compassion from their enemies, who have carried them
away. - In [Kg1 8:51-53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#051.md) Solomon closes
with general reasons, which should secure the hearing of his prayer on
the part of God. Bertheau follows the earlier commentators in admitting
that these reasons refer not merely to the last petitions, but to all
the preceding ones.

(Note: Seb. Schmidt has already given the following explanation: "These
things which I have asked for myself and for my people do Thou, O Lord,
because it is for Thy people that I have prayed, and I am their king:
therefore hear Thou the prayers of Thy servant and Thy people. For in
[Kg1 8:52](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#052.md) he makes mention of his own
case and of the cases of all the rest, in which they would call upon the
Lord.)

The plea "for they are Thy people," etc. ([Kg1
8:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#051).md), is taken from [Deu
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010.md); and that in [Kg1
8:53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#053.md), "Thou didst separate them,"
etc., is taken from [Lev 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024.md), [Lev
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#026.md), compared with [Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md). וגו עיניך להיות, "that Thine
eyes may be opened," follows upon ושׁמעתּ ("then hear Thou") in [Kg1
8:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#049.md); just as [Kg1
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029.md) at the commencement of the prayer
follows upon וּפנית in [Kg1 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#028.md). The
recurrence of the same expression shows that the prayer is drawing to a
close, and is rounded off by a return to the thought with which it
opened. "As Thou spakest by Moses" points back to [Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md). - In [Ch2
6:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#040.md) the conclusion of the prayer
is somewhat altered, and closes with the appeal to the Lord to cause
salvation and grace to go forth from the temple over His people.

Concluding Act of the dedication of the temple. [Kg1
8:54-61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054.md). Blessing the congregation. -
After the conclusion of the prayer, Solomon rose up from his knees and
blessed all the assembled congregation. פּרוּשׂות וכפּיו is a
circumstantial clause, which must be connected with the previous words
and rendered thus: "from lying upon his knees with his hands spread out
towards heaven." "And he stood," i.e., he came from the altar and stood
nearer to the assembled congregation. The blessing begins with praise to
the Lord for the fulfilment of His promises ([Kg1
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#016).md), and consists in the petition
that the Lord will always fulfil his (Solomon's) prayers, and grant His
people the promised salvation.

(Note: This blessing is omitted from the Chronicles, because it is
simply a recapitulation of the longer prayer; but instead of it we have
a statement, in [Ch2 7:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md), to the
effect that fire fell from heaven and consumed the burnt-offering upon
the altar. This statement, which even Movers regards as a traditional,
i.e., a legendary addition, according to his erroneous view of the
sources of the Chronicles, is confirmed by the similar miracle which
occurred at the dedication of the temple. It is omitted, like so many
other things in the account before us, because all that was essential in
this occurrence was contained implicite in the filling of the temple
with the glory of the Lord. Just as at the consecration of the Mosaic
sanctuary the Lord did not merely manifest His gracious presence through
the cloud which filled the tent, but also kindled the first sacrifice
with fire from heaven ([Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024).md), to
sanctify the altar as the legitimate place of sacrifice; so also at the
temple the miraculous kindling of the first sacrifice with fire from
heaven was the immediate and even necessary consequence of the filling
of the temple with the cloud, in which the presence of Jehovah was
embodied.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">kg1 8:56</span></span>

The praise of Jehovah rests, so far as the first part is concerned, upon
the promise in [Deu 12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#009.md), and upon
its fulfilment in [Jos 21:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#044.md) and
[Jos 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#014.md); and the second part is
founded upon [Lev 26:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003.md) and [Deu
28:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001.md), where the "good word, which
the Lord spake by Moses," is more precisely described as the blessing
which the Lord had promised to His people and had hitherto bestowed upon
them. He had already given Israel rest by means of Joshua when the land
of Canaan was taken; but since many parts of the land still remained in
the hands of the Canaanites, this rest was only fully secured to them by
David's victories over all their enemies. This glorious fulfilment
warranted the hope that the Lord would also fulfil in the future what He
had promised His servant David ([Sa2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010).md), if the people themselves would
only faithfully adhere to their God. Solomon therefore sums up all his
wishes for the good of the kingdom in [Kg1
8:57-61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#057.md) in the words, "May Jehovah our
God be with us, as He was with our fathers; may He not leave us nor
forsake us, to incline our heart to Himself, that we may walk in all His
ways," etc. - that the evil words predicted by Moses in [Lev
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014.md)., [Deu
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015.md), may not fall upon us. For [Kg1
8:57](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#057.md) compare [Deu
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006.md), [Deu
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#008.md), and [Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005.md). יטּשׁנוּ אל corresponds to ירפּך
אל in these passages. In the Pentateuch נטשׁ is used but once of men who
forsake the Lord, viz., [Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md); in
other cases it is only used in the general sense of casting away,
letting alone, and other similar meanings. It is first used of God, in
the sense of forsaking His people, in [Psa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md) in connection with עזב; and it
frequently occurs afterwards in Jeremiah.

Sacrifices and feast. - [Kg1 8:62](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062.md),
[Kg1 8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md). The dedicatory prayer was
followed by a magnificent sacrifice offered by the king and all Israel.
The thank-offering (שׁלמים זבח) consisted, in accordance with the
magnitude of the manifestation of divine grace, of 22,000 oxen and
120,000 sheep. This enormous number of sacrificial animals, in which J.
D. Michaelis found serious difficulties, Thenius endeavours to set aside
as too large, by calculating that as these sacrifices were offered in
seven days, reckoning the sacrificial day at twelve full hours, there
must have been about five oxen and about twenty-five sheep slaughtered
and offered in sacrifice every minute for the king alone. This
calculation would be conclusive, if there were any foundation for the
three assumptions upon which it rests: namely, (1) that the number of
sacrifices mentioned was offered for the king alone; (2) that the
slaughtering and preparation of the sacrificial animals could only be
performed by the priests and Levites; and (3) that the whole of the
flesh of these sacrificial animals was to be consumed upon the altar.
But these three assumptions are all erroneous. There is nothing in the
account about their being "for the king alone." For it is obvious that
the words "and Solomon offered a sacrifice" are not to be understood as
signifying that the king had these sacrifices offered for himself alone,
but that the words refer to the sacrifices offered by the king and all
Israel for the consecration of the temple, from the simple fact that in
[Kg1 8:62](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062.md) "Solomon and all Israel" are
expressly mentioned as offering sacrifice, and that after the statement
of the number of the sacrifices we find these words in [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md) : "so the king and all the
children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah." Moreover it is very
evident from the law in Lev 1 and 3 that at the offering of sacrifice
the slaughtering, flaying, and preparation of the sacrificial animals
were performed by any Israelite, and that it was only the sprinkling of
the blood against the altar and the burning of the sacrificial portions
upon the altar which were the exclusive province of the priests. In
order to form a correct idea of the enormous number of sacrifices which
could be slaughtered on any one day we will refer again to the notice in
Josephus (Bell. Jud. vi. 9, 3) already mentioned in the Comm. on the
Pentateuch, p. 683 (translation), that in the reign of the emperor Nero
the procurator Cestius directed the priests to count the number of the
paschal lambs, and that they counted 250,000, which were slaughtered for
the passover between the ninth and eleventh hours of the day, and of
which the blood was sprinkled upon the altar. If then it was possible at
that time to slaughter more than 250,000 lambs in three hours of the
afternoon, and to sprinkle the blood upon the altar, there can have been
no difficulty in slaughtering and sacrificing 3000 oxen and 18,000 sheep
at the dedication of the temple on each of the seven days of the
festival. As all Israel from Hamath to the brook of Egypt came to
Jerusalem to this festival, we shall not be above the mark if we
estimate the number of the heads of houses present at 100,000. And with
very little trouble they could have slaughtered 3000 oxen and 18,000
sheep a day and prepared them for sacrificing. How many priests took an
active part in this, we do not indeed know, in fact we have no
information as to the number of the priests in Solomon's time; but we
know that in the time of David the number of Levites qualified for
service, reckoning from their thirtieth year, was 38,000, so that we may
certainly assume that there were two or three thousand priests. Now if
only the half of these Levites and priests had come to Jerusalem to the
dedication of the temple, they alone could have slaughtered 3000 oxen
and 18,000 sheep every day. And would not a thousand priests have been
sufficient to sprinkle the blood of so many animals upon the altar and
to turn the fat between the morning and evening sacrifice? If we divided
these sacrifices among a thousand priests, each one would only have had
to attend to the sprinkling of the blood and burning of the fat of three
oxen and eighteen sheep each day. - But the brazen altar of
burnt-offering might not have been large enough for the burning of so
many sacrifices, notwithstanding the fact that only the fat portions of
the thank-offerings were consumed, and they did not require much room;
since the morning and evening burnt-offerings were added daily, and as
festal offerings they would certainly not consist of a lamb only, but at
least of one bullock, and they were burned whole, although the altar of
burnt-offering with a surface of 144 square yards (see my bibl. Archol.
i. p. 127) would hold a very large quantity of sacrificial flesh at
once. In v. 64, however, it is expressly stated that Solomon sanctified
the middle of the court, which was before the house of Jehovah, to burn
the burnt-offering and meat-offering and the fat portions of the
thank-offerings there, because the brazen altar was too small to hold
these sacrifices. "The middle of the court" (החצר תּוך) is the whole of
the inner portion of the court of the priests, which was in front of the
temple-house and formed the centre of the court surrounding the temple.
Of course we have not to imagine that the sacrifices were offered upon
the stone pavement of the court, but must assume that there were
auxiliary altars erected in the inner court around the brazen altar. By
the burnt-offering and the meat-offering (belonging to it: ואת־המּנחה
את־העולה) we are not to understand certain burnt-offerings, which were
offered for a definite number of thank-offerings, as Thenius supposes.
The singular and the definite article are both at variance with this.
The reference is rather to the (well-known) daily morning and evening
burnt-offerings with their meat-offering, and in this case, no doubt, to
such a festal sacrifice as is prescribed in Num 28 for the great yearly
feasts.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">kg1 8:65</span></span>

Thus Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a
great assembly from the neighbourhood of Hamath to the brook of Egypt,
i.e., from the whole land in its fullest extent from north to south.
"The district of Hamath," i.e., Epiphania on the Orontes, is mentioned
as the northern boundary (cf. [Num
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008.md); [Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md); [Jos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005), etc..md); and "the brook of Egypt"
(מצרים נחל), Rhinocorura, as the southern boundary (cf. [Num
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008.md); [Jos
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#004)). "The feast" (החג.md), which
Solomon held with the people "seven days and seven days, fourteen days,"
is not the feast of the dedication, but, as in [Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md), the feast of tabernacles, which
fell in the seventh month; and the meaning of the verse is, that on that
occasion the feast of the seventh month was kept for fourteen days,
namely, seven days as the feast of the dedication, and seven days as the
feast of tabernacles. We are obliged to take the words in this way,
partly on account of the evident reference to בּחג (at the feast) in
[Kg1 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md) in the expression את־החג (the
feast) in this verse, and partly on account of the statement which
follows in [Kg1 8:66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066.md), "and on the
eighth day he sent the people away." The "eight day" is not the first
day of the feast of tabernacles (Thenius); but the eighth day, as the
conclusion of the feast of tabernacles, עצרת ([Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036).md). The correctness of this view
is placed beyond all doubt by the context in the Chronicles, which
states more clearly that, "Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all
Israel with him ... and they kept עצרת (the closing feast) on the eight
day; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast
seven days; and on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the
people away." The feast of tabernacles lasted seven days, from the 15th
to the 21st, with a closing festival on the eighth day, i.e., the 22nd
of the month ([Lev 23:33-39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#033).md). This
festival was preceded by the dedication of the temple from the 8th to
the 14th of the month. The statement in [Kg1
8:66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066.md), "on the eighth day he sent the
people away," if we take the words in their strict sense, is at variance
with the statement in the Chronicles, "on the 23rd day," since the
eighth day of the feast of tabernacles was the 22nd day of the month;
but it may easily be accounted for from want of precision in a
well-known matter. Solomon sent the people away on the eighth day, i.e.,
on the afternoon or evening of the atzereth of the feast of tabernacles,
so that on the morning of the next day, i.e., on the 23rd of the month,
the people took their journey home, "joyful and glad of heart for all
the goodness that the Lord had shown to His servant David and to the
people." David is mentioned, because the completion of the building of
the temple was the fulfilment of the divine promise given to him.
"Tents," for houses, as in [Sa2 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md);
[Jdg 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#008.md), and other passages.
