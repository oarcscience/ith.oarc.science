Destruction of the Ungodly World-Power - Habakkuk 2

After receiving an answer to this supplicatory cry, the prophet receives
a command from God: to write the oracle in plain characters, because it
is indeed certain, but will not be immediately fulfilled ([Hab
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001).md). Then follows the word of God,
that the just will live through his faith, but he that is proud and not
upright will not continue ([Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md),
[Hab 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005).md); accompanied by a fivefold
woe upon the Chaldaean, who gathers all nations to himself with
insatiable greediness ([Hab 2:6-20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006).md).

[Habakkuk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 2:1</span></span>

[Hab 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md) form the introduction to
the word of God, which the prophet receives in reply to his cry of
lamentation addressed to the Lord in [Hab
1:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md). [Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md). "I will stand upon my watchtower,
and station myself upon the fortress, and will watch to see what He will
say in me, and what I answer to my complaint. [Hab
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002.md). Then Jehovah answered me, and
said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon the tables, that he may
run who reads it. [Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md). For the
vision is yet fore the appointed end, and strives after the end, and
does not lie: if it tarry, wait for it; for it will come, it does not
fail." [Hab 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md) contains the prophet's
conversation with himself. After he has poured out his trouble at the
judgment announced, in a lamentation to the Lord ([Hab
1:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012).md), he encourages himself -
after a pause, which we have to imagine after [Hab
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017.md) - to wait for the answer from
God. He resolves to place himself upon his observatory, and look out for
the revelation which the Lord will give to his questions. Mishmereth, a
place of waiting or observing; mâtsōr, a fortress, i.e., a watch-tower
or spying-tower. Standing upon the watch, and stationing himself upon
the fortification, are not to be understood as something external, as
Hitzig supposes, implying that the prophet went up to a steep and lofty
place, or to an actual tower, that he might be far away from the noise
and bustle of men, and there turn his eyes towards heaven, and direct
his collected mind towards God, to look out for a revelation. For
nothing is known of any such custom as this, since the cases mentioned
in [Exo 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#021.md) and [Kg1
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011.md), as extraordinary preparations
for God to reveal Himself, are of a totally different kind from this;
and the fact that Balaam the soothsayer went up to the top of a bare
height, to look out for a revelation from God ([Num
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003).md), furnishes not proof that the
true prophets of Jehovah did the same, but is rather a heathenish
feature, which shows that it was because Balaam did not rejoice in the
possession of a firm prophetic word, that he looked out for revelations
from God in significant phenomena of nature (see at [Num
23:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003).md). The words of our verse are to
be taken figuratively, or internally, like the appointment of the
watchman in [Isa 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006.md). The figure is
taken from the custom of ascending high places for the purpose of
looking into the distance ([Kg2 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#017.md);
[Sa2 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#024).md), and simply expresses the
spiritual preparation of the prophet's soul for hearing the word of God
within, i.e., the collecting of his mind by quietly entering into
himself, and meditating upon the word and testimonies of God. Cyril and
Calvin bring out the first idea. Thus the latter observes, that "the
watch-tower is the recesses of the mind, where we withdraw ourselves
from the world;" and then adds by way of explanation, "The prophet,
under the name of the watch-tower, implies that he extricates himself as
it were from the thoughts of the flesh, because there would be no end or
measure, if he wished to judge according to his own perception;" whilst
others find in it nothing more than firm continuance in reliance upon
the word of God.

(Note: Theodoret very appropriately compares the words of Asaph in [Psa
73:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016.md)., "When I thought to know this,
it was too painful for me, until I entered into the sanctuaries of God,
and gave heed to their end;" and observes, "And there, says the prophet,
will I remain as appointed, and not leave my post, but, standing upon
such a rock as that upon which God placed great Moses, watch with a
prophet's eyes for the solution of the things that I seek.")

Tsippâh, to spy or watch, to wait for the answer from God. "This
watching was lively and assiduous diligence on the part of the prophet,
in carefully observing everything that took place in the spirit of his
mind, and presented itself either to be seen or heard" (Burk).
ידבּר־בּי, to speak in me, not merely to or with me; since the speaking
of God to the prophets was an internal speaking, and not one that was
perceptible from without. What I shall answer to my complaint (‛al
tōkhachtı̄), namely, first of all to myself and then to the rest.
Tōkhachath, lit., correction, contradiction. Habakkuk refers to the
complaint which he raised against God in [Hab
1:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013.md), namely, that He let the
wicked go on unpunished. He will wait for an answer from God to this
complaint, to quiet his own heart, which is dissatisfied with the divine
administration. Thus he draws a sharp distinction between his own
speaking and the speaking of the Spirit of God within him. Jehovah gives
the answer in what follows, first of all ([Hab
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002.md), [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003).md) commanding him to write the
vision (châzōn, the revelation from God to be received by inward
intuition) upon tables, so clearly, that men may be able to read it in
running, i.e., quite easily.

בּאר as in [Deu 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#008.md); see at [Deu
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#005.md). The article attached to הלּחות
does not point to the tables set up in the market-places for public
notices to be written upon (Ewald), but simply means, make it clear on
the tables on which thou shalt write it, referring to the noun implied
in כּתב (write), though not expressed (Delitzsch). קורא בו may be
explained from קרא בּספר in [Jer
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#013.md). The question is a disputed one,
whether this command is to be understood literally or merely
figuratively, "simply denoting the great importance of the prophecy, and
the consequent necessity for it to be made accessible to the whole
nation" (Hengstenberg, Dissertation, vol. i. p. 460). The passages
quoted in support of the literal view, i.e., of the actual writing of
the prophecy which follows upon tables, viz., [Isa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md); [Isa
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008.md), and [Jer
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#002.md), are not decisive. In [Jer
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#002.md) the prophet is commanded to write
all the words of the Lord in a book (sēpher); and so again in [Isa
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008.md), if כּתבהּ על־לוּח is synonymous
with על־ספר חקּהּ. But in [Isa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md)
there are only two significant words, which the prophet is to write upon
a large table after having taken witnesses. It does not follow from
either of these passages, that luchōth, tables, say wooden tables, had
been already bound together into books among the Hebrews, so that we
could be warranted in identifying the writing plainly upon tables with
writing in a book. We therefore prefer the figurative view, just as in
the case of the command issued to Daniel, to shut up his prophecy and
seal it ([Dan 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004).md), inasmuch as the
literal interpretation of the command, especially of the last words,
would require that the table should be set up or hung out in some public
place, and this cannot for a moment be thought of. The words simply
express the thought, that the prophecy is to be laid to heart by all the
people on account of its great importance, and that not merely in the
present, but in the future also. This no doubt involved the obligation
on the part of the prophet to take care, by committing it to writing,
that it did not fall into oblivion. The reason for the writing is given
in [Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md). The prophecy is למּועד,
for the appointed time; i.e., it relates to the period fixed by God for
its realization, which was then still (עוד) far off. ל denotes direction
towards a certain point either of place or time. The vision had a
direction towards a point, which, when looked at from the present, was
still in the future. This goal was the end (הקּץ towards which it
hastened, i.e., the "last time" (מועד קץ, [Dan
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019.md); and עת קץ, [Dan
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md); [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035).md), the Messianic times, in which
the judgment would fall upon the power of the world. יפח לקּץ, it pants
for the end, inhiat fini, i.e., it strives to reach the end, to which it
refers. "True prophecy is inspired, as it were, by an impulse to fulfil
itself" (Hitzig). יפח is not an adjective, as in [Psa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md), but the third pers. imperf.
hiphil of pūăch; and the contracted form (יפח for יפיח), without a
voluntative meaning, is the same as we frequently meet with in the
loftier style of composition. ולא יכזּב, "and does not deceive," i.e.,
will assuredly take place. If it (the vision) tarry, i.e., be not
fulfilled immediately, wait for it, for it will surely take place (the
inf. abs. בּוא to add force, and בּוא applying to the fulfilment of the
prophecy, as in [Sa1 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006.md) and [Jer
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009).md), will not fail; אחר, to remain
behind, not to arrive ([Jdg 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#028.md); [Sa2
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#005).md).

(Note: The lxx have rendered כּי בא יבא, ὅτι ἐρχόμενος ἥξει, which the
author of the Epistle to the Hebrews ([Heb
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037).md) has still further defined by
adding the article, and, connecting it with μικρὸν ὅσον ὅσον of [Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020) (lxx.md), has taken it as
Messianic, and applied to the speedy coming of the Messiah to judgment;
not, however, according to the exact meaning of the words, but according
to the fundamental idea of the prophetic announcement. For the vision,
the certain fulfilment of which is proclaimed by Habakkuk, predicts the
judgment upon the power of the world, which the Messiah will bring to
completion.)

[Habakkuk 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hab 2:4</span></span>

With these verses the prophecy itself commences; namely, with a
statement of the fundamental thought, that the presumptuous and proud
will not continue, but the just alone will live. [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md). "Behold, puffed up, his soul is
not straight within him: but the just, through his faith will he live.
[Hab 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md). And moreover, the wine is
treacherous: a boasting man, he continues not; he who has opened his
soul as wide as hell, and is like death, and is not satisfied, and
gathered all nations to himself, and collected all peoples to himself."
These verses, although they contain the fundamental thought, or so to
speak the heading of the following announcement of the judgment upon the
Chaldaeans, are nevertheless not to be regarded as the sum and substance
of what the prophet was to write upon the tables. For they do indeed
give one characteristic of two classes of men, with a brief intimation
of the fate of both, but they contain no formally rounded thought, which
could constitute the motto of the whole; on the contrary, the
description of the insatiable greediness of the Chaldaean is attached in
[Hab 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md) to the picture of the haughty
sinner, that the two cannot be separated. This picture is given in a
subjective clause, which is only completed by the filling up in [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md). The sentence pronounced upon the
Chaldaean in [Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md), [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), simply forms the preparatory
introduction to the real answer to the prophet's leading question. The
subject is not mentioned in [Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md),
but may be inferred from the prophet's question in [Hab
1:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md). The Chaldaean is meant. His
soul is puffed up. עפּלה, perf. pual of עפל, of which the hiphil only
occurs in [Num 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#044.md), and that as
synonymous with הזיד in [Deu 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#043.md).
From this, as well as from the noun עפל, a hill or swelling, we get the
meaning, to be swollen up, puffed up, proud; and in the hiphil, to act
haughtily or presumptuously. The thought is explained and strengthened
by לא ישׁרה, "his soul is not straight." ישׁר, to be straight, without
turning and trickery, i.e., to be upright. בּו does not belong to נפשׁו
(his soul in him, equivalent to his inmost soul), but to the verbs of
the sentence. The early translators and commentators have taken this
hemistich differently. They divide it into protasis and apodosis, and
take עפּלה either as the predicate or as the subject. Luther also takes
it in the latter sense: "He who is stiff-necked will have no rest in his
soul." Burk renders it still more faithfully: ecce quae effert se, non
recta est anima ejus in eo. In either case we must supply נפשׁ אשׁר
after עפּלה. But such an ellipsis as this, in which not only the
relative word, but also the noun supporting the relative clause, would
be omitted, is unparalleled and inadmissible, if only because of the
tautology which would arise from supplying nephesh. This also applies to
the hypothetical view of הנּה עפּלה, upon which the Septuagint
rendering, ἐὰν ὑποστείληται, οὐκ εὐδοκεῖ ψυχή μου ἐν αὐτῶ, is founded.
Even with this view nephesh could not be omitted as the subject of the
protasis, and בּו would have no noun to which to refer. This rendering
is altogether nothing more than a conjecture, עפל being confounded with
עלף, and נפשׁו altered into נפשׁי. Nor is it proved to be correct, by
the fact that the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews ([Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038).md) makes use of the words of our
verse, according to this rendering, to support his admonition is to
stedfastness. For he does not introduce the verse as a quotation to
prove his words, but simply clothes his own thoughts in these words of
the Bible which floated before his mind, and in so doing transposes the
two hemistichs, and thereby gives the words a meaning quite in
accordance with the Scriptures, which can hardly be obtained from the
Alexandrian version, since we have there to take the subject to
ὑποστείληται from the preceding ἐρχόμενος, which gives no sense, whereas
by transposing the clauses a very suitable subject can be supplied from
ὁ δίκαιος.

The following clause, וצדּיק וגו, is attached adversatively, and in form
is subordinate to the sentence in the first hemistich in this sense,
"whilst, on the contrary, the righteous lives through his faith,"
notwithstanding the fact that it contains a very important thought,
which intimates indirectly that pride and want of uprightness will bring
destruction upon the Chaldaean. בּאמוּנתו belongs to יחיה, not to צדּיק.
The tiphchah under the word does not show that it belongs to tsaddı̄q,
but simply that it has the leading tone of the sentence, because it is
placed with emphasis before the verb (Delitzsch). אמוּנה does not denote
"an honourable character, or fidelity to conviction" (Hitzig), but (from
'âman, to be firm, to last) firmness ([Exo
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012).md); then, as an attribute of God,
trustworthiness, unchangeable fidelity in the fulfilment of His promises
([Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md); [Psa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#004.md); [Psa
89:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034).md); and, as a personal attribute
of man, fidelity in word and deed ([Jer
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028.md); [Jer
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002.md); [Psa
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003).md); and, in his relation to God,
firm attachment to God, an undisturbed confidence in the divine promises
of grace, firma fiducia and fides, so that in 'ĕmūnâh the primary
meanings of ne'ĕmân and he'ĕmı̄n are combined. This is also apparent from
the fact that Abraham is called ne'ĕmân in [Neh
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#008.md), with reference to the fact that
it is affirmed of him in [Gen 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md)
that האמין בּיהוה, "he trusted, or believed, the Lord;" and still more
indisputably from the passage before us, since it is impossible to
mistake the reference in צדּיק בּאמוּנתו יחיה to [Gen
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006), "he believed (he'ĕmı̄n.md) in
Jehovah, and He reckoned it to him litsedâqâh." It is also indisputably
evident from the context that our passage treats of the relation between
man and God, since the words themselves speak of a waiting (chikkâh) for
the fulfilment of a promising oracle, which is to be preceded by a
period of severe suffering. "What is more natural than that life or
deliverance from destruction should be promised to that faith which
adheres faithfully to God, holds fast by the word of promise, and
confidently waits for its fulfilment in the midst of tribulation? It is
not the sincerity, trustworthiness, or integrity of the righteous man,
regarded as being virtues in themselves, which are in danger of being
shaken and giving way in such times of tribulation, but, as we may see
in the case of the prophet himself, his faith. To this, therefore, there
is appended the great promise expressed in the one word יחיה"
(Delitzsch). And in addition to this, 'ĕmūnâh is opposed to the pride of
the Chaldaean, to his exaltation of himself above God; and for that very
reason it cannot denote integrity in itself, but simply some quality
which has for its leading feature humble submission to God, that is to
say, faith, or firm reliance upon God. The Jewish expositors, therefore,
have unanimously retained this meaning here, and the lxx have rendered
the word quite correctly πίστις, although by changing the suffix, and
giving ἐκ πίστεώς μου instead of αὐτοῦ (or more properly ἑαυτοῦ: Aquila
and the other Greek versions), they have missed, or rather perverted,
the sense. The deep meaning of these words has been first fully brought
out by the Apostle Paul ([Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md);
[Gal 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md) : see also [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038).md), who omits the erroneous μου of
the lxx, and makes the declaration ὁ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται the
basis of the New Testament doctrine of justification by faith.

[Hab 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md)

[Hab 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md) is closely connected with
[Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md), not only developing still
further the thought which is there expressed, but applying it to the
Chaldaean. אף כּי does not mean "really if" (Hitzig and others), even in
[Job 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#014.md); [Job
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014.md); [Eze
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#005.md), or [Sa1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006.md) (see Delitzsch on [Job
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014).md), but always means "still
further," or "yea also, that;" and different applications are given to
it, so that, when used as an emphatic assurance, it signifies "to say
nothing of the fact that," or when it gives emphasis to the thing
itself, "all the more because," and in negative sentences "how much
less" (e.g., [Kg1 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027).md). In the
present instance it adds a new and important feature to what is stated
in [Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md), "And add to this that
wine is treacherous;" i.e., to those who are addicted to it, it does not
bring strength and life, but leads to the way to ruin (for the thought
itself, see [Pro 23:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031).md). The
application to the Chaldaean is evident from the context. The fact that
the Babylonians were very much addicted to wine is attested by ancient
writers. Curtius, for example ([Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001).md), says, "Babylonii maxime in vinum
et quae ebrietatem sequuntur effusi sunt;" and it is well known from
Daniel 5 that Babylon was conquered while Belshazzar and the great men
of his kingdom were feasting at a riotous banquet. The following words
גּבר יהיר are not the object to בּוגד, but form a fresh sentence,
parallel to the preceding one: a boasting man, he continueth not. ולא
introduces the apodosis to גבר יהיר, which is written absolutely. יהיר
only occurs again in [Pro 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024.md), and
is used there as a parallel to זד: ἀλαζών (lxx), swaggering, boasting.
The allusion to the Chaldaean is evident from the relative clause which
follows, and which Delitzsch very properly calls an individualizing
exegesis to גבר יהיר. But looking to what follows, this sentence forms a
protasis to [Hab 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md), being written
first in an absolute form, "He, the widely opened one, etc., upon him
will all take up," etc. Hirchı̄bh naphshō, to widen his soul, i.e., his
desire, parallel to pâ‛ar peh, to open the mouth ([Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014).md), is a figure used to denote
insatiable desire. כּשׁאול, like Hades, which swallows up every living
thing (see [Pro 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md); [Pro
30:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015).md). The comparison to death has
the same meaning. ולא ישׂבּע does not refer to מות, but to the
Chaldaean, who grasps to himself in an insatiable manner, as in [Hab
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006.md), and [Hab
1:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015.md). The imperff. consecc. express
the continued gathering up of the nations, which springs out of his
insatiable desire.

[Habakkuk 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hab 2:6</span></span>

In [Hab 2:6-20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md) the destruction of the
Chaldaean, which has been already intimated in [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md), [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), is announced in the form of a
song composed of threatening sentences, which utters woes in five
strophes consisting of three verses each: (1) upon the rapacity and
plundering of the Chaldaean ([Hab
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006)); (2.md) upon his attempt to
establish his dynasty firmly by means of force and cunning ([Hab
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009)); (3.md) upon his wicked ways of
building ([Hab 2:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012)); (4.md) upon his
base treatment of the subjugated nations ([Hab
2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015)); and (5.md) upon his idolatry
([Hab 2:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018).md). These five strophes
are connected together, so as to form two larger divisions, by a refrain
which closes the first and fourth, as well as by the promise explanatory
of the threat in which the third and fifth strophes terminate; of which
two divisions the first threatens the judgment of retribution upon the
insatiableness of the Chaldaean in three woes ([Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005).md), and the second in two woes the
judgment of retribution upon his pride. Throughout the whole of the
threatening prophecy the Chaldaean nation is embraced, as in [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md), [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), in the ideal person of its ruler.

(Note: The unity of the threatening prophecy, which is brought out in
the clearest manner in this formal arrangement, has been torn in pieces
in the most violent manner by Hitzig, through his assumption that the
oracle of God includes no more than [Hab
2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md), and that a second part is
appended to it in [Hab 2:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md), in
which the prophet expresses his own thoughts and feelings, first of all
concerning king Jehoiakim ([Hab
2:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009).md), and then concerning the
Egyptians ([Hab 2:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015).md). This
hypothesis, of which Maurer observes quite correctly, Qua nulla unquam
excogitata est infelicior, rests upon nothing more than the dogmatic
assumption, that there is no such thing as prophecy effected by
supernatural causality, and therefore Habakkuk cannot have spoken of
Nebuchadnezzar's buildings before they were finished, or at any rate in
progress. The two strophes in [Hab
2:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md) contain nothing whatever that
would not apply most perfectly to the Chaldaean, or that is not covered
by what precedes and follows (compare [Hab
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md) with 6b and 8a, and [Hab
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010) with 5b and 8a.md). "The strophe in
[Hab 2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md) contains the same
fundamental thought as that expressed by Isaiah in [Isa
14:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md) respecting the Chaldaean,
viz., the description of his pride, which manifests itself in ambitious
edifices founded upon the ruins of the prosperity of strangers"
(Delitzsch). The resemblance between the contents of this strophe and
the woe pronounced upon Jehoiakim by Jeremiah in [Jer
12:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#013.md) may be very simply explained
from the fact that Jehoiakim, like the Chaldaean, was a tyrant who
occupied himself with the erection of large state buildings and
fortifications, whereas the extermination of many nations does not apply
in any respect to Jehoiakim. Lastly, there is no plausible ground
whatever for referring the last two strophes ([Hab
2:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015).md) to the Egyptian, for the
assertion that Habakkuk could not pass over the Egyptian in silence,
unless he meant to confine himself to the Chaldaean, is a pure petitio
principii; and to any unprejudiced mind the allusion to the Chaldaean in
this verse is placed beyond all possible doubt by [Isa
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008.md), where the devastation of Lebanon
is also attributed to him, just as it is in [Hab
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#017) of our prophecy..md)

[Hab 2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md)

Introduction of the ode and first strophe. - [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md). "Will not all these lift up a
proverb upon him, and a song, a riddle upon him? And men will say, Woe
to him who increases what is not his own! For how long? and who loadeth
himself with the burden of pledges. [Hab
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#007.md). Will not thy biters rise up
suddenly, and thy destroyers wake up, and thou wilt become booty to
them? [Hab 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md). For thou hast
plundered many nations, all the rest of the nations will plunder thee,
for the blood of men and wickedness on the earth, the city, and all its
inhabitants." הלוא is here, as everywhere else, equivalent to a
confident assertion. "All these:" this evidently points back to "all
nations" and "all people." Nevertheless the nations as such, or in
pleno, are not meant, but simply the believers among them, who expect
Jehovah to inflict judgment upon the Chaldaeans, and look forward to
that judgment for the revelation of the glory of God. For the ode is
prophetical in its nature, and is applicable to all times and all
nations. Mâshâl is a sententious poem, as in [Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004.md) and [Isa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md), not a derisive song, for this
subordinate meaning could only be derived from the context, as in [Isa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md) for example; and there is nothing
to suggest it here. So, again, melı̄tsâh neither signifies a satirical
song, nor an obscure enigmatical discourse, but, as Delitzsch has shown,
from the first of the two primary meanings combined in the verb לוּץ,
lucere and lascivire, a brilliant oration, oratio splendida, from which
מליץ is used to denote an interpreter, so called, not from the obscurity
of the speaking, but from his making the speech clear or intelligible.
חידות לו is in apposition to מליצה and משׁל, adding the more precise
definition, that the sayings contain enigmas relating to him (the
Chaldaean). The enigmatical feature comes out more especially in the
double meaning of עבטיט in [Hab 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md),
נשׁכיך in [Hab 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#007.md), and קיקלון in [Hab
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016.md). לאמר serves, like לאמר
elsewhere, as a direct introduction to the speech. The first woe applies
to the insatiable rapacity of the Chaldaean. המּרבּה לא־לו, who
increases what does not belong to him, i.e., who seizes upon a large
amount of the possessions of others. עד־מתי, for how long, sc. will he
be able to do this with impunity; not "how long has he already done
this" (Hitzig), for the words do not express exultation at the
termination of the oppression, but are a sign appended to the woe, over
the apparently interminable plunderings on the part of the Chaldaean.
וּמכבּיד is also dependent upon hōi, since the defined participle which
stands at the head of the cry of woe is generally followed by
participles undefined, as though the former regulated the whole (cf.
[Isa 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020.md) and [Isa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001).md). At the same time, it might be
taken as a simple declaration in itself, though still standing under the
influence of the hōi; in which case הוּא would have to be supplied in
thought, like וחוטא in [Hab 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010.md). And
even in this instance the sentence is not subordinate to the preceding
one, as Luther follows Rashi in assuming ("and still only heaps much
slime upon himself"); but is co-ordinate, as the parallelism of the
clauses and the meaning of עבטיט require. The ἁπ. λεγ. עבטיט is probably
chosen on account of the resemblance in sound to מכבּיד, whilst it also
covers an enigma or double entendre. Being formed from עבט (to give a
pledge) by the repetition of the last radical, עבטיט signifies the mass
of pledges (pignorum captorum copia: Ges., Maurer, Delitzsch), not the
load of guilt, either in a literal or a tropico-moral sense. The
quantity of foreign property which the Chaldaean has accumulated is
represented as a heavy mass of pledges, which he has taken from the
nations like an unmerciful usurer ([Deu
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010).md), to point to the fact that he
will be compelled to disgorge them in due time. הכבּיד, to make heavy,
i.e., to lay a heavy load upon a person. The word עבטיט, however, might
form two words so far as the sound is concerned: עב טיט, cloud (i.e.,
mass) of dirt, which will cause his ruin as soon as it is discharged.
This is the sense in which the Syriac has taken the word; and Jerome
does the same, observing, considera quam eleganter multiplicatas
divitias densum appellaverit lutum, no doubt according to a Jewish
tradition, since Kimchi, Rashi, and Ab. Ezra take the word as a
composite one, and merely differ as to the explanation of עב.
Grammatically considered, this explanation is indeed untenable, since
the Hebrew language has formed no appellative nomina composita; but the
word is nevertheless enigmatical, because, when heard from the lips, it
might be taken as two words, and understood in the sense indicated.

In [Hab 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#007.md) the threatening hōi is
still further developed. Will not thy biters arise? נשׁכיך = נשׁכתם אתך,
those who bite thee. In the description here given of the enemy as
savage vipers (cf. [Jer 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#017).md) there is
also an enigmatical double entendre, which Delitzsch has admirably
interpreted thus: "המּרבּה," he says, "pointed to תּרבּית (interest).
The latter, favoured by the idea of the Chaldaean as an unmerciful
usurer, which is concentrated in עבטיט, points to נשׁך, which is
frequently connected with תּרבּית, and signifies usurious interest; and
this again to the striking epithet נשׁכתם, which is applied to those who
have to inflict the divine retribution upon the Chaldaean. The prophet
selected this to suggest the thought that there would come upon the
Chaldaean those who would demand back with interest (neshek) the capital
of which he had unrighteously taken possession, just as he had
unmercifully taken the goods of the nations from them by usury and
pawn." יקצוּ, from יקץ, they will awake, viz., מזעזעך, those who shake
or rouse thee up. זעזע, pilel of זוּע, σείω, is used in Arabic of the
wind (to shake the tree); hence, as in this case, it was employed to
denote shaking up or scaring away from a possession, as is often done,
for example, by a creditor (Hitzig, Delitzsch). משׁסּות is an intensive
plural.

So far as this threat applies to the Chaldaeans, it was executed by the
Medes and Persians, who destroyed the Chaldaean empire. But the threat
has a much more extensive application. This is evident, apart from other
proofs, from [Hab 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md) itself,
according to which the whole of the remnant of the nations is to inflict
the retribution. Gōyı̄m rabbı̄m, "many nations:" this is not to be taken
as an antithesis to kol-haggōyı̄m (all nations) in [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), since "all nations" are simply
many nations, as kol is not to be taken in its absolute sense, but
simply in a relative sense, as denoting all the nations that lie within
the prophet's horizon, as having entered the arena of history. Through
ישׁלּוּך, which is placed at the head of the concluding clause without a
copula, the antithesis to שׁלּות is sharply brought out, and the idea of
the righteous retaliation distinctly expressed. כּל־יתר עמּים, the whole
remnant of the nations, is not all the rest, with the exception of the
one Chaldaean, for yether always denotes the remnant which is left after
the deduction of a portion; nor does it mean all the rest of the
nations, who are spared and not subjugated, in distinction from the
plundered and subjugated nations, as Hitzig with many others imagine,
and in proof of which he adduces the fact that the overthrow of the
Chaldaeans was effected by nations that had not been subdued. But, as
Delitzsch has correctly observed, this view makes the prophet contradict
not only himself, but the whole of the prophetic view of the world-wide
dominion of Nebuchadnezzar. According to [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), the Chaldaean has grasped to
himself the dominion over all nations, and consequently there cannot be
any nations left that he has not plundered. Moreover, the Chaldaean, or
Nebuchadnezzar as the head of the Chaldaean kingdom, appears in prophecy
([Jer 27:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007).md), as he does in history
([Dan 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038.md); 3:31; [Dan
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#019).md) throughout, as the ruler of the
world in the highest sense, who has subjugated all nations and kingdoms
round about, and compelled them to serve him. These nations include the
Medes and Elamites (= Persians), to whom the future conquest of Babylon
is attributed in [Isa 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017.md); [Isa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002.md); [Jer
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011.md), [Jer
51:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#028.md). They are both mentioned in [Jer
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#025.md) among the nations, to whom the
prophet is to reach the cup of wrath from the hand of Jehovah; and the
kingdom of Elam especially is threatened in [Jer
49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md). with the destruction of its
power, and dispersion to all four winds. In these two prophecies,
indeed, Nebuchadnezzar is not expressly mentioned by name as the
executor of the judgment of wrath; but in Jeremiah 25 this may plainly
be inferred from the context, partly from the fact that, according to
[Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md), Judah with its inhabitants,
and all nations round about, are to be given into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar, and partly from the fact that in the list of the nations
enumerated in [Jer 25:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md) the king
of Sesach (i.e., Babel) is mentioned as he who is to drink the cup
"after them" ([Jer 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).md). The
expression 'achărēhem (after them) shows very clearly that the judgment
upon the nations previously mentioned, and therefore also upon the kings
of Elam and Media, is to occur while the Chaldaean rule continues, i.e.,
is to be executed by the Chaldaeans. This may, in fact, be inferred, so
far as the prophecy respecting Elam in [Jer
49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md). is concerned, from the
circumstance that Jeremiah's prophecies with regard to foreign nations
in Jeremiah 46-51 are merely expansions of the summary announcement in
[Jer 25:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#019.md), and is also confirmed
by [Eze 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md), inasmuch as Elam is
mentioned there immediately after Asshur in the list of kings and
nations that have sunk to the lower regions before Egypt. And if even
this prophecy has a much wider meaning, like that concerning Elam in
[Jer 49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md), and the elegy over Egypt,
which Ezekiel strikes up, is expanded into a threatening prophecy
concerning the heathen generally (see Kliefoth, Ezech. p. 303), this
further reference presupposes the historical fulfilment which the
threatening words of prophecy have received through the judgment
inflicted by the Chaldaeans upon all the nations mentioned, and has in
this its real foundation and soil.

History also harmonizes with this prophetic announcement. The arguments
adduced by Hvernick (Daniel, p. 547ff.) to prove that Nebuchadnezzar did
not extend his conquests to Elam, and neither subdued this province nor
Media, are not conclusive. The fact that after the fall of Nineveh the
conquerors, Nabopolassar of Babylonia, and Cyaxares the king of Media,
divided the fallen Assyrian kingdom between them, the former receiving
the western provinces, and the latter the eastern, does not preclude the
possibility of Nebuchadnezzar, the founder of the Chaldaean empire,
having made war upon the Median kingdom, and brought it into subjection.
There is no historical testimony, however, to the further assertion,
that Nebuchadnezzar was only concerned to extend his kingdom towards the
west, that his conquests were all of them in the lands situated there,
and gave him so much to do that he could not possibly think of extending
his eastern frontier. It is true that the opposite of this cannot be
inferred from Strabo, xvi. 1, 18;

(Note: This passage is quoted by Hitzig (Ezech. p. 251) as a proof that
Elam made war upon the Babylonians, and, indeed, judging from [Jer
49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md), an unsuccessful war. But Strabo
speaks of a war between the Elymaeans (Elamites) and the Babylonians and
Susians, which M. v. Niebuhr (p. 210) very properly assigns to the
period of the alliance between Media (as possessor of Susa) and
Babylon.)

but it may be inferred, as M. v. Niebuhr (Gesch. Assurs, pp. 211-12) has
said, from the fact that according to Jeremiah 27 and 28, at the
beginning of Zedekiah's reign, and therefore not very long after
Nebuchadnezzar had conquered Jerusalem in the time of Jehoiachin, and
restored order in southern Syria in the most energetic manner, the kings
of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, entered into negotiations with
Zedekiah for a joint expedition against Nebuchadnezzar. M. v. Niebuhr
infers from this that troublous times set in at that period for
Nebuchadnezzar, and that this sudden change in the situation of affairs
was connected with the death of Cyaxares, and leads to the conjecture
that Nebuchadnezzar, who had sworn fealty to Cyaxares, refused at his
death to do homage to his successor; for fidelity to a father-in-law,
with whose help the kingdom was founded, would assume a very different
character if it was renewed to his successor. Babel was too powerful to
accept any such enfeoffment as this. And even if Nebuchadnezzar was not
a vassal, there could not be a more suitable opportunity for war with
Media than that afforded by a change of government, since kingdoms in
the East are so easily shaken by the death of a great prince. And there
certainly was no lack of inducement to enter upon a war with Media.
Elam, for example, from its very situation, and on account of the
restlessness of its inhabitants, must have been a constant apple of
discord. This combination acquires extreme probability, partly from the
fact that Jeremiah's prophecy concerning Elam, in which that nation is
threatened with the destruction of its power and dispersion to all four
winds, was first uttered at the commencement of Zedekiah's reign ([Jer
49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034).md), whereas the rest of his
prophecies against foreign nations date from an earlier period, and that
against Babel is the only one which falls later, namely, in the fourth
year of Zedekiah ([Jer 51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059).md), which
appears to point to the fact that at the commencement of Zedekiah's
reign things were brewing in Elam which might lead to his ruin. And it
is favoured in part by the account in the book of Judith of a war
between Nabuchodonosor (Nebuchadnezzar) and Media, which terminated
victoriously according to the Rec. vulg. in the twelfth year of his
reign, since this account is hardly altogether a fictitious one. These
prophetic and historical testimonies may be regarded as quite
sufficient, considering the universally scanty accounts of the Chaldaean
monarchy given by the Greeks and Romans, to warrant us in assuming
without hesitation, as M. v. Niebuhr has done, that between the ninth
and twentieth years of Nebuchadnezzar's reign - namely, at the
commencement of Zedekiah's reign - the former had to make war not only
with Elam, but with Media also, and that it is to this eastern war that
we should have to attribute the commotion in Syria.

From all this we may see that there is no necessity to explain "all the
remnant of the nations" as relating to the remainder of the nations that
had not been subjugated, but that we may understand it as signifying the
remnant of the nations plundered and subjugated by the Chaldaeans (as is
done by the lxx, Theodoret, Delitzsch, and others), which is the only
explanation in harmony with the usage of the language. For in [Jos
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#012.md) yether haggōyı̄m denotes the
Canaanitish nations left after the war of extermination; and in [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md) yether hâ‛âm signifies the
remnant of the nation left after the previous conquest of the city, and
the carrying away of half its inhabitants. In [Zep
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009.md) yether gōi is synonymous with
שׁארית עמּי, and our יתר עמּים is equivalent to שׁארית הגּוים in [Eze
36:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003.md). מדּמי אדם: on account of the
human blood unjustly shed, and on account of the wickedness on the earth
(chămas with the Genesis obj. as in [Joe
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#019.md) and [Oba
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010).md). 'Erets without an article is
not the holy land, but the earth generally; and so the city (qiryâh,
which is still dependent upon chămas) is not Jerusalem, nor any one
particular city, but, with indefinite generality, "cities." The two
clauses are parallel, cities and their inhabitants corresponding to men
and the earth. The Chaldaean is depicted as one who gathers men and
nations in his net ([Hab 1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014).md). And
so in [Jer 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023.md) he is called a hammer
of the whole earth, in [Jer 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md) a cup
of reeling, and in [Jer 51:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025.md) the
destroyer of the whole earth.

[Habakkuk 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hab 2:9</span></span>

The second woe is pronounced upon the wickedness of the Chaldaean, in
establishing for himself a permanent settlement through godless gain.
[Hab 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md). "Woe to him who getteth a
godless gain for his house, to set his nest on high, to save himself
from the hand of calamity. [Hab 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010.md).
Thou hast consulted shame to thy house, destruction of many nations, and
involvest thy soul in guilt. [Hab
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011.md). For the stone out of the wall
will cry, and the spar out of the wood will answer it." To the
Chaldaean's thirst for robbery and plunder there is attached quite
simply the base avarice through which he seeks to procure strength and
durability for his house. בּצע בּצע, to get gain, has in itself the
subordinate idea of unrighteous gain or sinful covetousness, since בּצע
denotes cutting or breaking something off from another's property,
though here it is still further strengthened by the predicate רע, evil
(gain). בּיתו (his house) is not the palace, but the royal house of the
Chaldaean, his dynasty, as [Hab 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010.md)
clearly shows, where בּית evidently denotes the king's family, including
the king himself. How far he makes בּצע for his family, is more
precisely defined by לשׂוּם וגו. קנּו, his (the Chaldaean's) nest, is
neither his capital nor his palace or royal castle; but the setting up
of his nest on high is a figure denoting the founding of his government,
and securing it against attacks. As the eagle builds its nest on high,
to protect it from harm (cf. [Job
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#027).md), so does the Chaldaean seek to
elevate and strengthen his rule by robbery and plunder, that it may
never be wrested from his family again. We might here think of the
buildings erected by Nebuchadnezzar for the fortification of Babylon,
and also of the building of the royal palace (see Berosus in Hos. c. Ap.
i. 19). We must not limit the figurative expression to this, however,
but must rather refer it to all that the Chaldaean did to establish his
rule. This is called the setting on high of his nest, to characterize it
as an emanation from his pride, and the lofty thoughts of his heart. For
the figure of the nest, see [Num
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021.md); [Oba
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004.md); [Jer
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016.md). His intention in doing this is
to save himself from the hand of adversity. רע is not masculine, the
evil man; but neuter, adversity, or "the hostile fate, which, so far as
its ultimate cause is God ([Isa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007).md),
is inevitable and irreversible" (Delitzsch). In [Hab
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010.md) the result of his heaping up of
evil gain is announced: he has consulted shame to his house. יעץ, to
form a resolution. His determination to establish his house, and make it
firm and lofty by evil gain, will bring shame to his house, and instead
of honour and lasting glory, only shame and ruin. קצות, which has been
variously rendered, cannot be the plural of the noun קצה, "the ends of
many nations," since it is impossible to attach any intelligent meaning
to this. It is rather the infinitive of the verb קצה, the occurrence of
which Hitzig can only dispute by an arbitrary alteration of the text in
four different passages, and is equivalent to קצץ, to cut off, hew off,
which occurs in the piel in [Kg2 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md)
and [Pro 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#006.md), but in the kal only
here. The infinitive construct does not stand for the inf. abs., or for
לקצות, exscindendo, but is used substantively, and is governed by יעצתּ,
which still retains its force from the previous clause. Thou hast
consulted (resolved upon) the cutting off, or destruction, of many
nations. וחוטא, and sinnest against thy soul thereby, i.e., bringest
retribution upon thyself, throwest away thine own life. On the use of
the participle in the sense of the second person without אתּה, see at
[Hab 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005.md). חטא, with the accusative of
the person, as in [Pro 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002.md) and [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036.md), instead of חטא בנפשׁו. The
participle is used, because the reference is to a present, which will
only be completed in the future (Hitzig and Delitzsch). The reason for
this verdict, and also for the hōi which stands at the head of this
strophe, follows in [Hab 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011.md). The
stone out of the wall and the spar out of the woodwork will cry, sc.
because of the wickedness which thou hast practised in connected with
thy buildings ([Hab 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002).md), or for
vengeance ([Gen 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010).md), because they
have been stolen, or obtained from stolen property. The apparently
proverbial expression of the crying of stones is applied in a different
way in [Luk 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#040.md). קיר does not mean
the wall of a room here, but, as distinguished from עץ, the outside
wall, and עץ, the woodwork or beams of the buildings. The ἁπ. λεγ.
כּפיס, lit., that which binds, from כפס in the Syriac and Targum, to
bind, is, according to Jerome, "the beam which is placed in the middle
of any building to hold the walls together, and is generally called
ἱμάντωσις by the Greeks." The explanations given by Suidas is, δέσις
ξύλων ἐμβαλλομένων ἐν τοῖς οἰκοδομήσασι, hence rafters or beams. יעננּה,
will answer, sc. the stone, i.e., join in its crying (cf. [Isa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014).md).

[Habakkuk 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hab 2:12</span></span>

The third woe refers to the building of cities with the blood and
property of strangers. [Hab 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012.md). "Woe
to him who buildeth cities with blood, and foundeth castles with
injustice. [Hab 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014.md). For the earth
will be filled with knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters
cover the sea." The earnest endeavour of the Chaldaean to found his
dynasty in permanency through evil gain, manifested itself also in the
building of cities with the blood and sweat of the subjugated nations.
עיר and קריה are synonymous, and are used in the singular with
indefinite generality, like קריה in [Hab
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md). The preposition ב, attached to
דּמים and עולה, denotes the means employed to attain the end, as in [Mic
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010.md) and [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013.md). This was murder, bloodshed,
transportation, and tyranny of every kind. Kōnēn is not a participle
with the Mem dropped, but a perfect; the address, which was opened with
a participle, being continued in the finite tense (cf. Ewald, 350, a).
With [Hab 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013.md) the address takes a
different turn from that which it has in the preceding woes. Whereas
there the woe is always more fully expanded in the central verse by an
exposition of the wrong, we have here a statement that it is of Jehovah,
i.e., is ordered or inflicted by Him, that the nations weary themselves
for the fire. The ו before יינעוּ introduces the declaration of what it
is that comes from Jehovah. הלוא הנּה (is it not? behold!) are connected
together, as in [Ch2 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#026.md), to point
to what follows as something great that was floating before the mind of
the prophet. בּדי אשׁ, literally, for the need of the fire (compare [Nah
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013.md) and [Isa
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#016).md). They labour for the fire,
i.e., that the fire may devour the cities that have been built with
severe exertion, which exhausts the strength of the nations. So far they
weary themselves for vanity, since the buildings are one day to fall
into ruins, or be destroyed. Jeremiah ([Jer
51:58](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#058).md) has very suitably applied these
words to the destruction of Babylon. This wearying of themselves for
vanity is determined by Jehovah, for ([Hab
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014).md) the earth shall be filled with
the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah. That this may be the case, the
kingdom of the world, which is hostile to the Lord and His glory, must
be destroyed. This promise therefore involves a threat directed against
the Chaldaean. His usurped glory shall be destroyed, that the glory of
Jehovah of Sabaoth, i.e., of the God of the universe, may fill the whole
earth. The thought in [Hab 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014.md) is
formed after [Isa 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md), with trifling
alterations, partly substantial, partly only formal. The choice of the
niphal תּפּלא instead of the מלאה of Isaiah refers to the actual fact,
and is induced in both passages by the different turn given to the
thought. In Isaiah, for example, this thought closes the description of
the glory and blessedness of the Messianic kingdom in its perfected
state. The earth is then full of the knowledge of the Lord, and the
peace throughout all nature which has already been promised is one fruit
of that knowledge. In Habakkuk, on the other hand, this knowledge is
only secured through the overthrow of the kingdom of the world, and
consequently only thereby will the earth be filled with it, and that not
with the knowledge of Jehovah (as in Isaiah), but with the knowledge of
His glory (כּבוד יי), which is manifested in the judgment and overthrow
of all ungodly powers ([Isa 2:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012.md);
[Isa 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md), compared with the primary
passage, [Num 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021).md). כּבוד יי is "the
δόξα of Jehovah, which includes His right of majesty over the whole
earth" (Delitzsch). יכסּוּ על־ים is altered in form, but not in sense,
from the ליּם מכסּים of Isaiah; and יכסּוּ is to be taken relatively,
since כ is only used as a preposition before a noun or participle, and
not like a conjunction before a whole sentence (comp. Ewald, 360, a,
with 337, c). לדער is an infinitive, not a noun, with the preposition ל;
for מלא, ימּלא is construed with the accus. rei, lit., the earth will be
filled with the acknowledging. The water of the sea is a figure denoting
overflowing abundance.

[Habakkuk 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hab 2:15</span></span>

The fourth woe is an exclamation uttered concerning the cruelty of the
Chaldaean in the treatment of the conquered nations. [Hab
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015.md). "Woe to him that giveth his
neighbour to drink, mixing thy burning wrath, and also making drunk, to
look at their nakedness. [Hab 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016.md).
Thou hast satisfied thyself with shame instead of with honour; then
drink thou also, and show the foreskin. The cup of Jehovah's right hand
will turn to thee, and the vomiting of shame upon thy glory. [Hab
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#017.md). For the wickedness at Lebanon
will cover thee, and the dispersion of the animals which frightened
them; for the blood of the men and the wickedness on the earth, upon the
city and all its inhabitants." The description in [Hab
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015.md) and [Hab
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016.md) is figurative, and the figure is
taken from ordinary life, where one man gives another drink, so as to
intoxicate him, for the purpose of indulging his own wantonness at his
expense, or taking delight in his shame. This helps to explain the משׁקה
רעהוּ, who gives his neighbour to drink. The singular is used with
indefinite generality, or in a collective, or speaking more correctly, a
distributive sense. The next two circumstantial clauses are subordinate
to הוי משׁקה, defining more closely the mode of the drinking. ספּח does
not mean to pour in, after the Arabic sfḥ; for this, which is another
form for Arab. sfk, answers to the Hebrew שׁפך, to pour out (compare
שׁפך חמתו, to pour out, or empty out His wrath: [Psa
79:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md); [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025).md), but has merely the meaning to
add or associate, with the sole exception of [Job
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019.md), where it is apparently used to
answer to the Arabic sfḥ; consequently here, where drink is spoken of,
it means to mix wrath with the wine poured out. Through the suffix חמתך
the woe is addressed directly to the Chaldaean himself, - a change from
the third person to the second, which would be opposed to the genius of
our language. The thought is sharpened by ואף שׁכּר, "and also (in
addition) making drunk" (shakkēr, inf. abs.). To look upon their
nakednesses: the plural מעוריהם is used because רעהוּ has a collective
meaning. The prostrate condition of the drunken man is a figurative
representation of the overthrow of a conquered nation ([Nah
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#011).md), and the uncovering of the shame
a figure denoting the ignominy that has fallen upon it ([Nah
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005.md); [Isa
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003).md). This allegory, in which the
conquest and subjugation of the nations are represented as making them
drink of the cup of wrath, does not refer to the open violence with
which the Chaldaean enslaves the nations, but points to the artifices
with which he overpowers them, "the cunning with which he entices them
into his alliance, to put them to shame" (Delitzsch). But he has thereby
simply prepared shame for himself, which will fall back upon him ([Hab
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016).md). The perfect שׂבעתּ does not
apply prophetically to the certain future; but, as in the earlier
strophes ([Hab 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md) and [Hab
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010).md) which are formed in a similar
manner, to what the Chaldaean has done, to bring upon himself the
punishment mentioned in what follows. The shame with which he has
satisfied himself is the shamefulness of his conduct; and שׂבע, to
satisfy himself, is equivalent to revelling in shame. מכּבוד, far away
from honour, i.e., and not in honour. מן is the negative, as in [Psa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005.md), in the sense of ולא, with which
it alternates in [Hos 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md). For this he
is now also to drink the cup of wrath, so as to fall down intoxicated,
and show himself as having a foreskin, i.e., as uncircumcised ( הערל
from ערלה ). This goblet Jehovah will hand to him. Tissōbh, he will
turn. על (upon thee, or to thee). This is said, because the cup which
the Chaldaean had reached to other nations was also handed over to him
by Jehovah. The nations have hitherto been obliged to drink it out of
the hand of the Chaldaean. Now it is his turn, and he must drink it out
of the hand of Jehovah (see [Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).md). וקיקלון, and shameful
vomiting, (sc., יהיה) will be over thine honour, i.e., will cover over
thine honour or glory, i.e., will destroy thee. The ἁπ. λεγ. קיקלון is
formed from the pilpal קלקל from קלל, and softened down from קלקלון, and
signifies extreme or the greatest contempt. This form of the word,
however, is chosen for the sake of the play upon קיא קלון, vomiting of
shame, vomitus ignominiae (Vulg.; cf. קיא צאה in [Isa
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#008).md), and in order that, when the
word was heard, it should call up the subordinate meaning, which
suggests itself the more naturally, because excessive drinking is
followed by vomiting (cf. [Jer
25:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).md).

This threat is explained in [Hab 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#017.md),
in the statement that the wickedness practised by the Chaldaean on
Lebanon and its beasts will cover or fall back upon itself. Lebanon with
its beasts is taken by most commentators allegorically, as a figurative
representation of the holy land and its inhabitants. But although it may
be pleaded, in support of this view, that Lebanon, and indeed the summit
of its cedar forest, is used in [Jer
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#006.md) as a symbol of the royal family
of Judaea, and in [Jer 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023.md) as a
figure denoting Jerusalem, and that in [Isa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024.md), and probably also in [Zac
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001.md), the mountains of Lebanon, as the
northern frontier of the Israelitish land, are mentioned synecdochically
for the land itself, and the hewing of its cedars and cypresses may be a
figurative representation of the devastation of the land and its
inhabitants; these passages do not, for all that, furnish any conclusive
evidence of the correctness of this view, inasmuch as in [Isa
10:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033.md), Lebanon with its forest is
also a figure employed to denote the grand Assyrian army and its
leaders, and in [Isa 60:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#013.md) is a symbol
of the great men of the earth generally; whilst in the verse before us,
the allusion to the Israelitish land and nation is neither indicated,
nor even favoured, by the context of the words. Apart, for example, from
the fact that such a thought as this, "the wickedness committed upon the
holy land will cover thee, because of the wickedness committed upon the
earth," not only appears lame, but would be very difficult to sustain on
biblical grounds, inasmuch as the wickedness committed upon the earth
and its inhabitants would be declared to be a greater crime than that
committed upon the land and people of the Lord; this view does not
answer to the train of thought in the whole of the ode, since the
previous strophes do not contain any special allusion to the devastation
of the holy land, or the subjugation and ill-treatment of the holy
people, but simply to the plundering of many nations, and the gain
forced out of their sweat and blood, as being the great crime of the
Chaldaean (cf. [Hab 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md), [Hab
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010.md), [Hab
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013).md), for which he would be visited
with retribution and destruction. Consequently we must take the words
literally, as referring to the wickedness practised by the Chaldaean
upon nature and the animal world, as the glorious creation of God,
represented by the cedars and cypresses of Lebanon, and the animals
living in the forests upon those mountains. Not satisfied with robbing
men and nations, and with oppressing and ill-treating them, the
Chaldaean committed wickedness upon the cedars and cypresses also, and
the wild animals of Lebanon, cutting down the wood either for military
purposes or for state buildings, so that the wild animals were
unsparingly exterminated. There is a parallel to this in [Isa
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008.md), where the cypresses and cedars
of Lebanon rejoice at the fall of the Chaldaean, because they will be no
more hewn down. Shōd behēmōth, devastation upon (among) the animals
(with the gen. obj., as in [Isa 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004.md)
and [Psa 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006).md). יחיתן is a relative
clause, and the subject, shōd, the devastation which terrified the
animals. The form יחיתן for יחתּן, from יחת, hiphil of חתת, is
anomalous, the syllable with dagesh being resolved into an extended one,
like התימך for התמּך in [Isa 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md); and
the tsere of the final syllable is exchanged for pathach because of the
pause, as, for example, in התעלּם in [Psa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#002) (see Olshausen, Gramm. p. 576.md).
There is no necessity to alter it into יחיתך (Ewald and Olshausen after
the lxx, Syr., and Vulg.), and it only weakens the idea of the talio.
The second hemistich is repeated as a refrain from [Hab
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md).

[Habakkuk 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hab 2:18</span></span>

Fifth and last strophe. - [Hab 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018.md).
"What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath carved it;
the molten image and the teacher of lies, that the maker of his image
trusteth in him to make dumb idols? [Hab
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#019.md). Woe to him that saith to the
wood, Wake up; Awake, to the hard stone. Should it teach? Behold, it is
encased in gold and silver, and there is nothing of breath in its
inside. [Hab 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md). But Jehovah is in
His holy temple: let all the world be silent before Him." This
concluding strophe does not commence, like the preceding ones, with hōi,
but with the thought which prepares the way for the woe, and is attached
to what goes before to strengthen the threat, all hope of help being cut
off from the Chaldaean. Like all the rest of the heathen, the Chaldaean
also trusted in the power of his gods. This confidence the prophet
overthrows in [Hab 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018.md) : "What use is
it?" equivalent to "The idol is of no use" (cf. [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011.md); [Isa
44:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009).md). The force of this question
still continues in massēkhâh: "Of what use is the molten image?" Pesel
is an image carved out of wood or stone; massēkhâh an image cast in
metal. הועיל is the perfect, expressing a truth founded upon experience,
as a fact: What profit has it ever brought? Mōreh sheqer (the teacher of
lies) is not the priest or prophet of the idols, after the analogy of
[Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md) and [Isa
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#014.md); for that would not suit the
following explanatory clause, in which עליו (in him) points back to
mōreh sheqer: "that the maker of idols trusteth in him (the teacher of
lies)." Consequently the mōreh sheqer must be the idol itself; and it is
so designated in contrast with the true God, the teacher in the highest
sense (cf. [Job 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#022).md). The idol is a
teacher of lying, inasmuch as it sustains the delusion, partly by itself
and partly through its priests, that it is God, and can do what men
expect from God; whereas it is nothing more than a dumb nonentity ('elı̄l
'illēm: compare εἴδωλα ἄφωνα, [Co1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#002).md). Therefore woe be to him who
expects help from such lifeless wood or image of stone. עץ is the block
of wood shaped into an idol. Hâqı̄tsâh, awake! sc. to my help, as men
pray to the living God ([Psa 35:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#023.md);
[Psa 44:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#024.md); [Psa
59:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006.md); [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009).md). הוּא יורה is a question of
astonishment at such a delusion. This is required by the following
sentence: it is even encased in gold. Tâphas: generally to grasp; here
to set in gold, to encase in gold plate (zâhâbh is an accusative). כּל
אין: there is not at all. רוּח, breath, the spirit of life (cf. [Jer
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014).md). [Hab
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018.md) and [Hab
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#019.md) contain a concise summary of the
reproaches heaped upon idolatry in [Isa
44:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009.md); but they are formed quite
independently, without any evident allusions to that passage. In [Hab
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md) the contrast is drawn between the
dumb lifeless idols and the living God, who is enthroned in His holy
temple, i.e., not the earthly temple at Jerusalem, but the heavenly
temple, or the temple as the throne of the divine glory ([Isa
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001).md), as in [Mic
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#002.md), whence God will appear to judge
the world, and to manifest His holiness upon the earth, by the
destruction of the earthly powers that rise up against Him. This thought
is implied in the words, "He is in His holy temple," inasmuch as the
holy temple is the palace in which He is enthroned as Lord and Ruler of
the whole world, and from which He observes the conduct of men ([Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004).md). Therefore the whole earth,
i.e., all the population of the earth, is to be still before Him, i.e.,
to submit silently to Him, and wait for His judgment. Compare [Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md) and [Zac
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013.md), where the same command is
borrowed from this passage, and referred to the expectation of judgment.
חס is hardly an imper. apoc. of הסה, but an interjection, from which the
verb hâsâh is formed. But if the whole earth must keep silence when He
appears as Judge, it is all over with the Chaldaean also, with all his
glory and might.
