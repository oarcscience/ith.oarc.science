A Twenty-Two-Fold String of Aphorisms by One Who Is Persecuted for the
Sake of His Faith

To the Hodu Ps 118, written in gnome-like, wreathed style, is appended
the throughout gnomico-didactic Psalms 119, consisting of one hundred
and seventy-six Masoretic verses, or regarded in relation to the
strophe, distichs, which according to the twenty-two letters of the
alphabet fall into twenty-two groups (called by the old expositors the
ὀγδοάδες or octonarii of this Psalmus literatus s. alphabetites); for
each group contains eight verses (distichs), each of which begins with
the same consecutive letter (8 x 22 = 176). The Latin Psalters (as the
Psalterium Veronense, and originally perhaps all the old Greek Psalters)
have the name of the letter before each group; the Syriac has the signs
of the letters; and in the Complutensian Bible, as also elsewhere, a new
line begins with each group. The Talmud, B. Berachoth, says of this
Psalm: "it consists of eight Alephs," etc.; the Masora styles it אלפא
ביתא רבא; the Midrash on it is called מדרשׁ אלפא ביתא, and the Pesikta
פסיקתא דתמניא אפי. In our German version it has the appropriate
inscription, "The Christian's golden A B C of the praise, love, power,
and use of the word of God;" for here we have set forth in inexhaustible
fulness what the word of God is to a man, and how a man is to behave
himself in relation to it. The Masora observes that the Psalm contains
only the one [Psa 119:122](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122.md), in which
some reference or other to the word of revelation is not found as in all
the 175 others

(Note: "In every verse," this is the observation of the Masora on [Psa
119:122](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122.md), "v. 122 only excepted, we
find one of the ten (pointing to the ten fundamental words or decalogue
of the Sinaitic Law) expressions: word, saying, testimonies, way,
judgment, precept, commandment (צוּוּי), law, statute, truth" (according
to another reading, righteousness).)

\- a many-linked chain of synonyms which runs through the whole Psalm.
In connection with this ingenious arrangement, so artfully devised and
carried out, it may also not be merely accidental that the address Jahve
occurs twenty-two times, as Bengel has observed: bis et vicesies pro
numero octonariorum.

All kinds of erroneous views have, however, been put forth concerning
this Psalm. Kster, von Gerlach, Hengstenberg, and Hupfeld renounce all
attempts to show that there is any accordance whatever with a set plan,
and find here a series of maxims without any internal progression and
connection. Ewald begins at once with the error, that we have before us
the long prayer of an old experienced teacher. But from [Psa
119:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009.md). it is clear that the poet
himself is a "young man," a fact that is also corroborated by [Psa
119:99](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#099.md), [Psa
119:100](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#100.md). The poet is a young man, who
finds himself in a situation which is clearly described: he is derided,
oppressed, persecuted, and that by those who despise the divine word
(for apostasy encompasses him round about), and more particularly by a
government hostile to the true religion, [Psa
119:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#023.md), [Psa
119:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#046.md), [Psa
119:161](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#161.md). He is lying in bonds ([Psa
119:61](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#061.md), cf. [Psa
119:83](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#083).md), expecting death ([Psa
119:109](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#109).md), and recognises in his
affliction, it is true, God's salutary humbling, and in the midst of it
God's word is his comfort and his wisdom, but he also yearns for help,
and earnestly prays for it. - The whole Psalm is a prayer for
stedfastness in the midst of an ungodly, degenerate race, and in the
midst of great trouble, which is heightened by the pain he feels at the
prevailing apostasy, and a prayer for ultimate deliverance which rises
in group Kaph to an urgent how long! If this sharply-defined physiognomy
of the Psalm is recognised, then the internal progression will not fail
to be discerned.

After the poet has praised fidelity to the word of God (Aleph), and
described it as the virtue of all virtues which is of service to the
young man and to which he devotes himself (Beth), he prays, in the midst
of the scoffing and persecuting persons that surround him, for the grace
of enlightenment (Gimel), of strengthening (Daleth), of preservation
(He), of suitable and joyful confession (Vav); God's word is all his
thought and pursuit (Zajin), he cleaves to those who fear God (Ḥeth),
and recognises the salutary element of His humbling (Ṭeth), but is in
need of comfort (Jod) and signs: how long! (Kaph). Without the eternal,
sure, mighty word of God he would despair (Lamed); this is his wisdom in
difficult circumstances (Mem); he has sworn fidelity to it, and
maintains his fidelity as being one who is persecuted (Nun), and abhors
and despises the apostates (Samech). He is oppressed, but God will not
suffer him to be crushed (Ajin); He will not suffer the doings of the
ungodly, which wring from him floods of tears, to prevail over him (Phe)
- over him, the small (still youthful) and despised one whom zeal
concerning the prevailing godlessness is consuming away (Tsade). Oh that
God would hear his crying by day and by night (Ḳoph), would revive him
speedily with His helpful pity (Resh) - him, viz., who being persecuted
by princes clings fast to Him (Shin), and would seek him the isolated
and so sorely imperilled sheep! (Tav). This outline does not exhaust the
fundamental thoughts of the separate ogdoades, and they might surely be
still more aptly reproduced, but this is sufficient to show that the
Psalm is not wanting in coherence and progressive movement, and that it
is not an ideal situation and mood, but a situation and mood based upon
public relationships, from which this manifold celebration of the divine
word, as a fruit of its teaching, has sprung.

It is natural to suppose that the composition of the Psalm falls in
those times of the Greek domination in which the government was hostile,
and a large party from among the Jews themselves, that was friendly
towards the government, persecuted all decided confessors of the Tra.
Hitzig says, "It can be safely maintained that the Psalm was written in
the Maccabaean age by a renowned Israelite who was in imprisonment under
Gentile authorities." It is at least probable that the plaited work of
so long a Psalm, which, in connection with all that is artificial about
it, from beginning to end gives a glimpse of the subdued afflicted mien
of a confessor, is the work of one in prison, who whiled away his time
with this plaiting together of his complaints and his consolatry
thoughts.

[Psalms 119:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 119:1</span></span>

The eightfold Aleph. Blessed are those who act according to the word of
God; the poet wishes to be one of these. The alphabetical Psalm on the
largest scale begins appropriately, not merely with a simple ([Psa
112:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001).md), but with a twofold ashr. It
refers principally to those integri viae (vitae). In [Psa
119:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#003.md) the description of those who are
accounted blessed is carried further. Perfects,a s denoting that which
is habitual, alternate with futures used as presents. In [Psa
119:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#004.md) לשׁמר expresses the purpose of
the enjoining, as in [Psa 119:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#005.md) the
goal of the directing. אחלי (whence אחלי, [Kg2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#003).md) is compounded of אח (vid., supra,
p. 273) and לי (לוי), and consequently signifies o si. On יכּנוּ cf.
[Pro 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026) (lxx κατευθυνθείησαν.md). The
retrospective אז is expanded anew in [Psa
119:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#006.md): then, when I namely. "Judgment
of Thy righteousness" are the decisions concerning right and wrong which
give expression to and put in execution the righteousness of God.

(Note: The word "judgments" of our English authorized version is
retained in the text as being the most convenient word; it must,
however, be borne in mind that in this Psalm it belongs to the "chain of
synonyms," and does not mean God's acts of judgment, its more usual
meaning in the Old Testament Scriptures, but is used as defined above,
and is the equivalent here of the German Rechte, not Gerichte. - Tr.)

בּלמדי refers to Scripture in comparison with history.

[Psalms 119:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 119:9</span></span>

The eightfold Beth. Acting in accordance with the word of God, a young
man walks blamelessly; the poet desires this, and supplicates God's
gracious assistance in order to it. To purify or cleanse one's way or
walk (זכּה, cf. [Psa 73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013.md); [Pro
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009).md) signifies to maintain it pure
(זך, root זך, Arab. zk, to prick, to strike the eye, nitere;

(Note: The word receives the meaning of νικᾶν (vid., supra, p. 367),
like Arab. ḏhr and bhr, from the signification of outshining =
overpowering.)

vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chaldisches Wrterbuch, i. 424) from the
spotting of sin, or to free it from it. [Psa
119:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009.md) is the answer to the question in
[Psa 119:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009.md); לשׁמר signifies
custodiendo semetipsum, for שׁמר can also signify "to be on one's guard"
without נפשׁו ([Jos 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#018).md). The old
classic (e.g., [Psa 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031).md) אמרתך
alternates throughout with דּברך; both are intended collectively. One is
said to hide (צפן) the word in one's heart when one has it continually
present with him, not merely as an outward precept, but as an inward
motive power in opposition to selfish action ([Job
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012).md). In [Psa
119:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#012.md) the poet makes his way through
adoration to petition. ספּרתּי in [Psa
119:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#013.md) does not mean enumeration, but
recounting, as in [Deu 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md). עדות is
the plural to עדוּת; עדות, on the contrary, in [Psa
119:138](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#138.md) is the plural to עדה: both are
used of God's attestation of Himself and of His will in the word of
revelation. כּעל signifies, according to [Psa
119:162](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#162.md), "as over" (short for כּאשׁר
על), not: as it were more than (Olshausen); the כּ would only be
troublesome in connection with this interpretation. With reference to
הון, which has occurred already in [Psa
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013.md); [Psa
112:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#003.md) (from הון, Arab. hawn, to be
light, levem), aisance, ease, opulence, and concrete, goods, property,
vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chald. Wrterb. i. 423f. ארחתיך, [Psa
119:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#015.md), are the paths traced out in
the word of God; these he will studiously keep in his eye.

[Psalms 119:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 119:17</span></span>

The eightfold Gimel. This is his life's aim: he will do it under fear of
the curse of apostasy; he will do it also though he suffer persecution
on account of it. In [Psa 119:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#017.md) the
expression is only אחיה as [Psa
118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md), not ואחיה as in [Psa
119:77](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#077.md), [Psa
119:116](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#116.md), [Psa
119:144](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#144.md) : the apodosis imper. only
begins with ואשׁמרה, whereas אחיה is the good itself for the bestowment
of which the poet prays. גּל in [Psa
119:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018.md) is imper. apoc. Piel for גּלּה,
like גס in [Dan 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#012.md). נפלאות is the
expression for everything supernatural and mysterious which is
incomprehensible to the ordinary understanding and is left to the
perception of faith. The Tפra beneath the surface of its letter contains
an abundance of such "wondrous things," into which only eyes from which
God has removed the covering of natural short-sightedness penetrate;
hence the prayer in [Psa 119:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018.md). Upon
earth we have no abiding resting-place, we sojourn here as in a strange
land ([Psa 119:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#019.md), [Psa
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013.md); [Ch1
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015).md). Hence the poet prays in [Psa
119:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#019.md) that God would keep His
commandments, these rules of conduct for the journey of life, in living
consciousness for him. Towards this, according to [Psa
119:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#020.md), his longing tends. גּרס (Hiph.
in [Lam 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#016).md) signifies to crush in
pieces, Arab. jrš, and here, like the Aramaic גּרס, גּרס, to be crushed,
broken in pieces. לתאבה (from תּאב, [Psa
119:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#040.md), [Psa
119:174](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#174), a secondary form of אבה.md)
states the bias of mind in or at which the soul feels itself thus
overpowered even to being crushed: it is crushing form longing after
God's judgment, viz., after a more and more thorough knowledge of them.
In [Psa 119:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#021.md) the lxx has probably
caught the meaning of the poet better than the pointing has done,
inasmuch as it draws ἐπικατάρατοι to [Psa
119:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#021.md), so that [Psa
119:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#021.md) consists of two words, just
like [Psa 119:59](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#059.md), [Psa
119:89](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089.md); and Kamphausen also follows
this in his rendering. For ארוּרים as an attribute is unpoetical, and as
an accusative of the predicate far-fetched; whereas it comes in
naturally as a predicate before השּׁגים ממּצותיך: cursed (ארר = Arab.
harra, detestari), viz., by God. Instead of גּל, "roll" (from גּלל, [Jos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009).md), it is pointed in [Psa
119:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#022) (מעל.md) גּל, "uncover" = גּלּה,
as in [Psa 119:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018.md), reproach being
conceived of as a covering or veil (as e.g., in [Psa
69:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008).md), cf. [Isa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008.md) (perhaps also [Lam
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014.md); [Lam
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022.md), if גּלּה על there signifies "to
remove the covering upon anything"). גּם in [Psa
119:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#023.md), as in [Jer
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025.md), has the sense of גּם־כּי,
etiamsi; and גּם in [Psa 119:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#024.md) the
sense of nevertheless, ὅμως, Ew. 354, a. On נדבּר בּ (reciprocal), cf.
[Eze 33:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#030.md). As in a criminal tribunal,
princes sit and deliberate how they may be able to render him harmless.

[Psalms 119:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 119:25</span></span>

The eightfold Daleth. He is in deep trouble, and prays for consolation
and strengthening by means of God's word, to which he resigns himself.
His soul is fixed to the dust ([Psa
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#026).md) in connection with such
non-recognition and proscription, and is incapable of raising itself. In
[Psa 119:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025.md) he implores new strength
and spirits (חיּה as in [Psa 71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020.md);
[Psa 85:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#007).md) from God, in conformity
with and by reason of His word. He has rehearsed his walk in every
detail to God, and has not been left without an answer, which has
assured him of His good pleasure: may He then be pleased to advance him
ever further and further in the understanding of His word, in order
that, though men are against him, he may nevertheless have God on his
side, [Psa 119:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#026.md). The complaint
and request expressed in [Psa 119:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025.md)
are renewed in [Psa 119:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#028.md). דּלף
refers to the soul, which is as it were melting away in the trickling
down of tears; קיּם is a Piel of Aramaic formation belonging to the
later language. In [Psa 119:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#029.md) the
way of lies or of treachery, and the way of faithfulness or of
perseverance in the truth, stand in opposition to one another. חנן is
construed with a double accusative, inasmuch as תּורה has not the rigid
notion of a fixed teaching, but of living empirical instruction. שׁוּה
(short for שׁוה לנגד, [Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008).md)
signifies to put or set, viz., as a norma normans that stands before
one's eyes. He cleaves to the testimonies of God; may Jahve not
disappoint the hope which to him springs up out of them, according to
the promise, [Psa 119:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#031.md). He runs,
i.e., walks vigorously and cheerfully, in the way of God's commandments,
for He has widened his heart, by granting and preserving to the
persecuted one the joyfulness of confession and the confidence of hope.

[Psalms 119:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 119:33</span></span>

The eightfold He. He further prays for instruction and guidance that he
may escape the by-paths of selfishness and of disavowal. The noun עקב,
used also elsewhere as an accus. adverb., in the signification ad
extremum ([Psa 119:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#033.md) and [Psa
119:112](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#112).md) is peculiar to our poet.
אצּרנּה (with a Shebג which takes a colouring in accordance with the
principal form) refers back to דּרך. In the petition "give me
understanding" (which occurs six times in this Psalm) חבין is causative,
as in [Job 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md), and frequently in the
post-exilic writings. בּצע (from בּצע, abscindere, as κέρδος accords in
sound with κείρειν) signifies gain and acquisition by means of the
damage which one does to his neighbour by depreciating his property, by
robbery, deceit, and extortion ([Sa1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#003).md), and as a name of a vice,
covetousness, and in general selfishness. שׁוא is that which is without
real, i.e., without divine, contents or intrinsic worth, - God-opposed
teaching and life. בּדרכך

(Note: Heidenheim and Baer erroneously have בּדרכיך with Jod. plural.,
contrary to the Masora.)

is a defective plural; cf. חסדך, [Psa
119:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#041.md), וּמשׁפּטך, [Psa
119:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#043.md), and frequently. Establishing,
in [Psa 119:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#038.md), is equivalent to a
realizing of the divine word or promise. The relative clause אשׁר ליראתך
is not to be referred to לעבדּך according to [Psa
119:85](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#085.md) (where the expression is
different), but to אמרתך: fulfil to Thy servant Thy word or promise, as
that which (quippe quae) aims at men attaining the fear of Thee and
increasing therein (cf. [Psa 130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md);
[Psa 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004).md). The reproach which the
poet fears in [Psa 119:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#039.md) is not the
reproach of confessing, but of denying God. Accordingly משׁפּטיך are not
God's judgments i.e., acts of judgment, but revealed decisions or
judgments: these are good, inasmuch as it is well with him who keeps
them. He can appeal before God to the fact that he is set upon the
knowledge and experience of these with longing of heart; and he bases
his request upon the fact that God by virtue of His righteousness, i.e.,
the stringency with which He maintains His order of grace, both as to
its promises and its duties, would quicken him, who is at present as it
were dead with sorrow and weariness.

[Psalms 119:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">psa 119:41</span></span>

The eightfold Vav. He prays for the grace of true and fearlessly joyous
confession. The lxx renders [Psa
119:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#041.md): καὶ ἔλθοι ἐπ ̓ ἐμε ̓ τὸ ἔλεός
σου; but the Targum and Jerome rightly (cf. [Psa
119:77](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#077.md), [Isa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007).md) have the plural: God's proofs of
loving-kindness in accordance with His promises will put him in the
position that he will not be obliged to be dumb in the presence of him
who reproaches him (חרף, prop. a plucker, cf. Arab. charûf, a lamb = a
plucker of leaves or grass), but will be able to answer him on the
ground of his own experience. The verb ענה, which in itself has many
meanings, acquires the signification "to give an answer" through the
word, דּבר, that is added (synon. השׁיב דּבר). [Psa
119:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#043.md) also refers to the duty of
confessing God. The meaning of the prayer is, that God may not suffer
him to come to such a pass that he will be utterly unable to witness for
the truth; for language dies away in the mouth of him who is unworthy of
its before God. The writer has no fear of this for himself, for his hope
is set towards God's judgments (למשׁפּטך, defective plural, as also in
[Psa 119:149](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#149.md); in proof of which,
compare [Psa 119:156](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#156.md) and [Psa
119:175](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#175).md), his confidence takes its
stand upon them. The futures which follow from [Psa
119:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#044.md) to [Psa
119:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#048.md) declare that what he would
willingly do by the grace of God, and strives to do, is to walk בּרחבה,
in a broad space (elsewhere בּמּרחב), therefore unstraitened, which in
this instance is not equivalent to happily, but courageously and
unconstrainedly, without allowing myself to be intimidated, and said of
inward freedom which makes itself known outwardly. In [Psa
119:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#046.md) the Vulgate renders: Et
loquebar de (in) testimoniis tuis in conspectu regum et non confundebar
- the motto of the Augsburg Confession, to which it was adapted
especially in connection with this historical interpretation of the two
verbs, which does not correspond to the original text. The lifting up of
the hands in [Psa 119:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#048.md) is an
expression of fervent longing desire, as in connection with prayer, [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md); [Psa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005.md); [Psa
134:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002.md); [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md), and frequently. The second אשׁר
אהבתי is open to the suspicion of being an inadvertent repetition. שׂיח
בּ (synon. בּ הגה) signifies a still or audible meditating that is
absorbed in the object.

[Psalms 119:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">psa 119:49</span></span>

The eightfold Zajin. God's word is his hope and his trust amidst all
derision; and when he burns with indignation at the apostates, God's
word is his solace. Since in [Psa
119:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049.md) the expression is not דּברך but
דּבר, it is not to be interpreted according to [Psa
98:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003.md); [Psa
106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045.md), but: remember the word
addressed to Thy servant, because Thou hast made me hope (Piel causat.
as e.g., נשּׁה, to cause to forget, [Gen
41:51](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#051).md), i.e., hast comforted me by
promising me a blessed issue, and hast directed my expectation
thereunto. This is his comfort in his dejected condition, that God's
promissory declaration has quickened him and proved its reviving power
in his case. In הליצוּני (הליצוּני), ludificantur, it is implied that
the זדים eht taht d are just לצים, frivolous persons, libertines,
free-thinkers ([Pro 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024).md). משׁפּטיך,
[Psa 119:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#052.md), are the valid, verified
decisions (judgments) of God revealed from the veriest olden times. In
the remembrance of these, which determine the lot of a man according to
the relation he holds towards them, the poet found comfort. It can be
rendered: then I comforted myself; or according to a later usage of the
Hithpa.: I was comforted. Concerning זלעפה, aestus, vid., [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md), and on the subject-matter, [Psa
119:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#021.md), [Psa
119:104](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#104.md). The poet calls his earthly
life "the house of his pilgrimage;" for it is true the earth is man's
([Psa 115:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#016).md), but he has no abiding
resting-place there ([Ch1 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015).md), his
בּית עולם ([Ecc 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005).md) is elsewhere
(vid., supra, [Psa 119:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#019.md), [Psa
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013).md). God's statutes are here his
"songs," which give him spiritual refreshing, sweeten the hardships of
the pilgrimage, and measure and hasten his steps. The Name of God has
been in his mind hitherto, not merely by day, but also by night; and in
consequence of this he has kept God's law (ואשׁמרה, as five times
besides in this Psalm, cf. [Psa 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006.md),
and to be distinguished from ואשׁמרה, [Psa
119:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#044).md). Just this, that he keeps
(observat) God's precepts, has fallen to his lot. To others something
else is allotted ([Psa 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008).md), to him
this one most needful thing.

[Psalms 119:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">psa 119:57</span></span>

The eightfold Heth. To understand and to keep God's word is his portion,
the object of his incessant praying and thanksgiving, the highest grace
or favour that can come to him. According to [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md); [Psa
73:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026.md), the words חלקי ה belong
together. [Psa 119:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#057.md) is an inference
drawn from it (אמר ל as in [Exo 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014.md),
and frequently), and the existing division of the verse is verified.
חלּה פּני, as in [Psa 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013.md), is an
expression of caressing, flattering entreaty; in Latin, caput mulcere
(demulcere). His turning to the word of God the poet describes in [Psa
119:59](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#059.md) as a result of a careful trying
of his actions. After that he quickly and cheerfully, [Psa
119:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#060.md), determined to keep it without
any long deliberation with flesh and blood, although the snares of
wicked men surround him. The meaning of חבלי is determined according to
[Psa 119:110](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#110.md) : the pointing does not
distinguish so sharply as one might have expected between חבלי, ὠδῖνας,
and חבלי, snares, bonds (vid., [Psa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005)..md); but the plural nowhere,
according to the usage of the language as we now have it, signifies
bands (companies), from the singular in [Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005) (Bttcher, 800.md). Thankfulness
urges him to get up at midnight (acc. temp. as in [Job
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020).md) to prostrate himself before God
and to pray. Accordingly he is on friendly terms with, he is closely
connected with ([Pro 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#024).md), all who
fear God. Out of the fulness of the loving-kindness of God, which is
nowhere unattested upon earth ([Psa
119:64](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#064.md) = [Psa
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#005).md), he implores for himself the
inward teaching concerning His word as the highest and most cherished of
mercies.

[Psalms 119:65](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">psa 119:65</span></span>

The eightfold Teth. The good word of the gracious God is the fountain of
all good; and it is learned in the way of lowliness. He reviews his
life, and sees in everything that has befallen him the good and
well-meaning appointment of the God of salvation in accordance with the
plan and order of salvation of His word. The form עבדּך, which is the
form out of pause, is retained in [Psa
119:65](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#065.md) beside Athnach, although not
preceded by Olewejored (cf. [Psa
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md); [Psa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011.md); [Pro
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021).md). Clinging believingly to the
commandments of God, he is able confidently to pray that He would teach
him "good discernment" and "knowledge." טעם is ethically the capacity of
distinguishing between good and evil, and of discovering the latter as
it were by touch; טוּב טעם, good discernment, is a coupling of words
like טוּב לב, a happy disposition, cheerfulness. God has brought him
into this relationship to His word by humbling him, and thus setting him
right out of his having gone astray. אמרה in [Psa
119:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067.md), as in [Psa
119:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011.md), is not God's utterance
conveying a promise, but imposing a duty. God is called טּוב as He who
is graciously disposed towards man, and מתיב as He who acts out this
disposition; this loving and gracious God he implores to become his
Teacher. In his fidelity to God's word he does not allow himself to be
led astray by any of the lies which the proud try to impose upon him
(Bttcher), or better absolutely (cf. [Job
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004).md): to patch together over him,
making the true nature unrecognisable as it were by means of false
plaster or whitewash (טפל, to smear over, bedaub, as the Targumic,
Talmudic, and Syriac show). If the heart of these men, who by slander
make him into a caricature of himself, is covered as it were with thick
fat (a figure of insensibility and obduracy, [Psa
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md); [Psa
73:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#007.md); [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md), lxx ἐτυρώθη, Aquila ἐλιπάνθη,
Symmachus ἐμυαλώθη) against all the impressions of the word of God, he,
on the other hand, has his delight in the law of God (שׁעשׁע with an
accusative of the object, not of that which is delighted, [Psa
94:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#019), but of that which delights.md).
How beneficial has the school of affliction through which he has
attained to this, been to him! The word proceeding from the mouth of God
is now more precious to him than the greatest earthly riches.

[Psalms 119:73](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#073.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_073">psa 119:73</span></span>

The eightfold Jod. God humbles, but He also exalts again according to
His word; for this the poet prays in order that he may be a consolatory
example to the God-fearing, to the confusion of his enemies. It is
impossible that God should forsake man, who is His creature, and deny to
him that which makes him truly happy, viz., the understanding and
knowledge of His word. For this spiritual gift the poet prays in [Psa
119:73](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#073.md) (cf. on 73a, [Deu
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md); [Job
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008.md); [Job
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015).md); and he wishes in [Psa
119:74](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#074.md) that all who fear God may see
in him with joy an example of the way in which trust in the word of God
is rewarded (cf. [Psa 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#003.md); [Psa
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027.md); [Psa
69:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033.md); [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042), and other passages.md). He knows
that God's acts of judgment are pure righteousness, i.e., regulated by
God's holiness, out of which they spring, and by the salvation of men,
at which they aim; and he knows that God has humbled him אמוּנה (accus.
adverb. for בּאמוּנה), being faithful in His intentions towards him; for
it is just in the school of affliction that one first learns rightly to
estimate the worth of His word, and comes to feel its power. But
trouble, though sweetened by an insight into God's salutary design, is
nevertheless always bitter; hence the well-justified prayer of [Psa
119:76](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#076.md), that God's mercy may
notwithstanding be bestowed upon him for his consolation, in accordance
with the promise which is become his (ל as in [Psa
119:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049).md), His servant's. עוּת, [Psa
119:78](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#078.md), instead of being construed
with the accusative of the right, or of the cause, that is perverted, is
construed with the accusative of the person upon whom such perversion of
right, such oppression by means of misrepresentation, is inflicted, as
in [Job 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#006.md); [Lam
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#036.md). Chajug' reads עוּדוּני as in
[Psa 119:61](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#061.md). The wish expressed in
[Psa 119:79](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#079.md) is to be understood
according to [Psa 73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010.md); [Jer
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019.md), cf. [Pro
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004.md), [Pro
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016.md). If instead of וידעי (which is
favoured by [Psa 119:63](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#063).md), we read
according to the Chethb וידעוּ (cf. [Psa
119:125](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#125).md), then what is meant by
ישׁוּבוּ לּי is a turning towards him for the purpose of learning: may
their knowledge be enriched from his experience. For himself, however,
in [Psa 119:80](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#080.md) he desires unreserved,
faultless, unwavering adherence to God's word, for only thus is he
secure against being ignominiously undeceived.

[Psalms 119:81](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_081">psa 119:81</span></span>

The eightfold Kaph. This strengthening according to God's promise is his
earnest desire (כּלה) now, when within a very little his enemies have
compassed his ruin (כּלּה). His soul and eyes languish (כּלה as in [Psa
69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004.md); [Psa
84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md), cf. [Job
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#027).md) for God's salvation, that it
may be unto him according to God's word or promise, that this word may
be fulfilled. In [Psa 119:83](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#083.md) כּי is
hypothetical, as in [Psa 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012.md) and
frequently; here, as perhaps also in [Psa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md), in the sense of "although" (Ew.
֗362, b). He does not suffer anything to drive God's word out of his
mind, although he is already become like a leathern bottle blackened and
shrivelled up in the smoke. The custom of the ancients of placing jars
with wine over the smoke in order to make the wine prematurely old,
i.e., to mellow it (vid., Rosenm׬ller), does not yield anything towards
the understanding of this passage: the skin-bottle that is not intended
for present use is hung up on high; and the fact that it had to
withstand the upward ascending smoke is intelligible, notwithstanding
the absence of any mention of the chimney. The point of comparison, in
which we agree for the most part with Hitzig, is the removal of him who
in his dungeon is continually exposed to the drudgery of his
persecutors. כּמּה in [Psa 119:84](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#084.md) is
equivalent to "how few." Our life here below is short, so also is the
period within which the divine righteousness can reveal itself. שׁיחות
(instead of which the lxx erroneously reads שׂיחות), pits, is an old
word, [Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md). The relative clause,
[Psa 119:85](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#085.md), describes the "proud" as
being a contradiction to the revealed law; for there was no necessity
for saying that to dig a pit for others is not in accordance with this
law. All God's commandments are an emanation of His faithfulness, and
therefore too demand faithfulness; but it is just this faithfulness that
makes the poet an object of deadly hatred. They have already almost
destroyed him"in the land." It is generally rendered "on earth;" but "in
heaven" at the beginning of the following octonary is too far removed to
be an antithesis to it, nor does it sound like one (cf. on the other
hand ἐν τοῖς ouranoi's, [Mat 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012).md). It
is therefore: in the land (cf. [Psa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003.md); [Psa
73:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#009).md), where they think they are the
only ones who have any right there, they have almost destroyed him,
without shaking the constancy of his faith. But he stands in need of
fresh grace in order that he may not, however, at last succumb.

[Psalms 119:89](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_089">psa 119:89</span></span>

The eightfold Lamed. Eternal and imperishable in the constant verifying
of itself is the vigorous and consolatory word of God, to which the poet
will ever cling. It has heaven as its standing-place, and therefore it
also has the qualities of heaven, and before all others, heaven-like
stability. Ps 89 ([Psa 89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003).md) uses
similar language in reference to God's faithfulness, of which here [Psa
119:90](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#090.md) says that it endureth into all
generations. The earth hath He creatively set up, and it standeth, viz.,
as a practical proof and as a scene of His infinite, unchangeable
faithfulness. Heaven and earth are not the subjects of [Psa
119:91](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#091) (Hupfeld.md), for only the earth
is previously mentioned; the reference to the heavens in [Psa
119:89](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089.md) is of a very different
character. Hitzig and others see the subject in למשׁפּטיך: with respect
to Thy judgments, they stand fast unto this day; but the עבדיך which
follows requires another meaning to be assigned to עמדוּ: either of
taking up one's place ready for service, or, since עמד למשׁפט is a
current phrase in [Num 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#012.md); [Jos
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006.md); [Eze
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#024.md), of placing one's self ready to
obey (Bttcher). The subject of עמדוּ, as the following הכּל shows, is
meant to be thought of in the most general sense (cf. [Job
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#014).md): all beings are God's servants
(subjects), and have accordingly to be obedient and humble before His
judicial decisions - היּום, "even to this day," the poet adds, for these
judicial decisions are those which are formulated beforehand in the Tra.
Joy in this ever sure, all-conditioning word has upheld the poet in his
affliction, [Psa 119:92](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#092.md). He who has
been persecuted and cast down as it were to death, owes his reviving to
it, [Psa 119:93](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#093.md). From Him whose
possession or property he is in faith and love he also further looks for
his salvation, [Psa 119:94](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#094.md). Let
evil-doers lie in wait for him (קוּוּ in a hostile sense, as in [Psa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md), קוּה, cf. חכּה, going back to
קוה, Arab. qawiya, with the broad primary signification, to be tight,
firm, strong) to destroy him, he meditates on God's testimonies. He
knows from experience that all (earthly) perfection (תּכלה) has an end
(inasmuch as, having reached its height, it changes into its opposite);
God's commandment (singular as in [Deu
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#022).md), on the contrary, is exceeding
broad (cf. [Job 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#009).md), unlimited in
its duration and verification.

[Psalms 119:97](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#097.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_097">psa 119:97</span></span>

The eightfold Mem. The poet praises the practical wisdom which the word
of God, on this very account so sweet to him, teaches. God's precious
law, with which he unceasingly occupies himself, makes him superior in
wisdom ([Deu 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006).md), intelligence, and
judgment to his enemies, his teachers, and the aged ([Job
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#020).md). There were therefore at that
time teachers and elders (πρεσβύτεροι), who (like the Hellenizing
Sadducees) were not far from apostasy in their laxness, and hostilely
persecuted the young and strenuous zealot for God's law. The
construction of [Psa 119:98](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#098.md) is like
[Joe 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020.md); [Isa
59:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012.md), and frequently. היא refers to
the commandments in their unity: he has taken possession of them for
ever (cf. [Psa 119:111](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#111).md). The Mishna
(Aboth iv. 1) erroneously interprets: from all my teachers do I acquire
understanding. All three מן in [Psa
119:98-100](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#098) signify prae (lxx ὑπὲρ.md). In
כּלאתי, [Psa 119:101](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#101.md), from the mode of
writing we see the verb Lamed Aleph passing over into the verb Lamed He.
הורתני is, as in [Pro 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#011.md) (cf. [Exo
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#015).md), a defective mode of writing for
הוריתני. נמלצוּ, [Psa 119:103](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103.md), is not
equivalent to נמרצוּ, [Job 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025.md) (vid.,
Job, at [Job 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025.md); [Job
16:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002).md), but signifies, in consequence
of the dative of the object לחכּי, that which easily enters, or that
which tastes good (lxx ὡς gluke'a); therefore surely from מלץ = מלט, to
be smooth: how smooth, entering easily ([Pro
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031)), are Thy words (promises.md) to my
palate or taste! The collective singular אמרתך is construed with a
plural of the predicate (cf. [Exo
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#010).md). He has no taste for the
God-estranged present, but all the stronger taste for God's promised
future. From God's laws he acquires the capacity for proving the
spirits, therefore he hates every path of falsehood (= [Psa
119:128](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#128).md), i.e., all the heterodox
tendencies which agree with the spirit of the age.

[Psalms 119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_105">psa 119:105</span></span>

The eightfold Nun. The word of God is his constant guide, to which he
has entrusted himself for ever. The way here below is a way through
darkness, and leads close past abysses: in this danger of falling and of
going astray the word of God is a lamp to his feet, i.e., to his course,
and a light to his path ([Pro 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023).md);
his lamp or torch and his sun. That which he has sworn, viz., to keep
God's righteous requirements, he has also set up, i.e., brought to
fulfilment, but not without being bowed down under heavy afflictions in
confessing God; wherefore he prays (as in [Psa
119:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025).md) that God would revive him in
accordance with His word, which promises life to those who keep it. The
confessions of prayer coming from the inmost impulse of his whole heart,
in which he owns his indebtedness and gives himself up entirely to God's
mercy, he calls the free-will offerings of his mouth in [Psa
119:108](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#108.md) (cf. [Psa
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014); 19:15.md). He bases the prayer for
a gracious acceptance of these upon the fact of his being reduced to
extremity. "To have one's soul in one's hand" is the same as to be in
conscious peril of one's life, just as "to take one's soul into one's
hand" ([Jdg 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003.md); [Sa1
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#005.md); [Sa1
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#021.md); [Job
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014).md) is the same as to be ready to
give one's life for it, to risk one's life.

(Note: Cf. B. Taanth 8a: "The prayer of a man is not answered אלא אם כן
משׂים נפשׁו בכפו, i.e., if he is not ready to sacrifice his life.")

Although his life is threatened ([Psa
119:87](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#087).md), yet he does not waver and
depart from God's word; he has taken and obtained possession of God's
testimonies for ever (cf. [Psa
119:98](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#098).md); they are his "heritage," for
which he willingly gives up everything else, for they (המּה inexactly
for הנּה) it is which bless and entrance him in his inmost soul. In [Psa
119:112](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#112.md) it is not to be interpreted
after [Psa 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012.md) : eternal is the
reward (of the carrying out of Thy precepts), but in [Psa
119:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#033.md) עקב is equivalent to לעד, and
[Psa 119:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#044.md) proves that [Psa
119:112](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#112.md) need not be a thought that is
complete in itself.

[Psalms 119:113](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#113.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113">psa 119:113</span></span>

The eightfold Samech. His hope rests on God's word, without allowing
itself to be led astray by doubters and apostates. סעפים (the form of
nouns which indicate defects or failings) are those inwardly divided,
halting between two opinions (סעפּים), [Kg1
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md), who do homage partly to the
worship of Jahve, partly to heathenism, and therefore are trying to
combine faith and naturalism. In contrast to such, the poet's love,
faith, and hope are devoted entirely to the God of revelation; and to
all those who are desirous of drawing him away he addresses in [Psa
119:115](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#115.md) (cf. [Psa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#009).md) an indignant "depart." He,
however, stands in need of grace in order to persevere and to conquer.
For this he prays in [Psa 119:116-117](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#116.md).
The מן in משּׁברי is the same as in בּושׁ מן. The ah of ואשׁעה is the
intentional ah (Ew. 228, c), as in [Isa
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023.md). The statement of the ground of
the סלית, vilipendis, does not mean: unsuccessful is their deceit
(Hengstenberg, Olshausen), but falsehood without the consistency of
truth is their self-deceptive and seductive tendency. The lxx and Syriac
read תּרעיתם, "their sentiment;" but this is an Aramaic word that is
unintelligible in Hebrew, which the old translators have conjured into
the text only on account of an apparent tautology. The reading השּׁבתּ
or חשׁבתּ (Aquila, Symmachus, and Jerome; lxx ἐλογισάμην, therefore
חשׁבתי) instead of חשׁבתּ might more readily be justified in [Psa
119:119](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#119.md); but the former gives too
narrow a meaning, and the reading rests on a mistaking of the
construction of השׁבית with an accusative of the object and of the
effect: all the wicked, as many of them as are on the earth, dost Thou
put away as dross (סגים( ssor). Accordingly משׁפטיך in [Psa
119:120](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#120.md) are God's punitive judgments,
or rather (cf. [Psa 119:91](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#091).md) God's laws
(judgments) according to which He judges. What is meant are sentences of
punishment, as in Lev. 26, Deut. 28. Of these the poet is afraid, for
omnipotence can change words into deeds forthwith. In fear of the God
who has attested Himself in [Exo 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md)
and elsewhere, his skin shudders and his hair stands on end.

[Psalms 119:121](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#121.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_121">psa 119:121</span></span>

The eightfold Ajin. In the present time of apostasy and persecution he
keeps all the more strictly to the direction of the divine word, and
commends himself to the protection and teaching of God. In the
consciousness of his godly behaviour (elsewhere always צדק וּמשׁפּט,
here in one instance משׁפט וצדק) the poet hopes that God will surely not
(בּל) leave him to the arbitrary disposal of his oppressors. This hope
does not, however, raise him above the necessity and duty of constant
prayer that Jahve would place Himself between him and his enemies. ערב
seq. acc. signifies to stand in any one's place as furnishing a
guarantee, and in general as a mediator, [Job
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003.md); [Isa
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014.md); לטוב similar to לטובה, [Psa
86:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#017.md), [Neh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#019.md) : in my behalf, for my real
advantage. The expression of longing after redemption in [Psa
119:123](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#123.md) sounds like [Psa
119:81](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081.md). "The word of Thy
righteousness" is the promise which proceeds from God's "righteousness,"
and as surely as He is "righteous" cannot remain unfulfilled. The one
chief petition of the poet, however, to which he comes back in [Psa
119:124](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#124.md)., has reference to the ever
deeper knowledge of the word of God; for this knowledge is in itself at
once life and blessedness, and the present calls most urgently for it.
For the great multitude (which is the subject to הפרוּ) practically and
fundamentally break God's law; it is therefore time to act for Jahve
(עשׂה ל as in [Gen 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#030.md), [Isa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md), [Eze
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#020).md), and just in order to this
there is need of well-grounded, reliable knowledge. Therefore the poet
attaches himself with all his love to God's commandments; to him they
are above gold and fine gold ([Psa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011).md), which he might perhaps gain by
a disavowal of them. Therefore he is as strict as he possibly can be
with God's word, inasmuch as he acknowledges and observes all precepts
of all things (כּל־פּקּוּדי כל), i.e., all divine precepts, let them
have reference to whatsoever they will, as ישׁרים, right (ישּׁר, to
declare both in avowal and deed to be right); and every false (lying)
tendency, all pseudo-Judaism, he hates. It is true [Psa
119:126](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#126.md) may be also explained: it is
time that Jahve should act, i.e., interpose judicially; but this thought
is foreign to the context, and affords no equally close union for על־כן;
moreover it ought then to have been accented עת לעשׂות ליהוה. On
כּל־פּקּוּדי כל, "all commands of every purport," cf. [Isa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md), and more as to form, [Num
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#016.md); [Eze
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#030.md).

The expression is purposely thus heightened; and the correction
כל־פקודיך (Ewald, Olshausen, and Hupfeld) is also superfluous, because
the reference of what is said to the God of revelation is self-evident
in this connection.

[Psalms 119:129](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#129.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129">psa 119:129</span></span>

The eightfold Phe. The deeper his depression of spirit concerning those
who despise the word of God, the more ardently does he yearn after the
light and food of that word. The testimonies of God are פּלאות,
wonderful and strange (paradoxical) things, exalted above every-day life
and the common understanding. In this connection of the thoughts נצרתם
is not intended of careful observance, but of attentive contemplation
that is prolonged until a clear penetrating understanding of the matter
is attained. The opening, disclosure (פּתח, apertio, with Tsere in
distinction from פּתח, porta) of God's word giveth light, inasmuch as it
makes the simple (פּתיים as in [Pro
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003).md) wise or sagacious; in connection
with which it is assumed that it is God Himself who unfolds the
mysteries of His word to those who are anxious to learn. Such an one,
anxious to learn, is the poet: he pants with open mouth, viz., for the
heavenly fare of such disclosures (פּער like פּער פּה in [Job
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#023.md), cf. [Psa
81:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011).md). יאב is a hapaxlegomenon, just
as תּאב is also exclusively peculiar to the Psalm before us; both are
secondary forms of אבה. Love to God cannot indeed remain unresponded to.
The experience of helping grace is a right belonging to those who love
the God of revelation; love in return for love, salvation in return for
the longing for salvation, is their prerogative. On the ground of this
reciprocal relation the petitions in [Psa
119:133-135](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#133.md) are then put up, coming
back at last to the one chief prayer "teach me." אמרה, [Psa
119:133](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#133.md), is not merely a "promise" in
this instance, but the declared will of God in general. כּל־און refers
pre-eminently to all sin of disavowal (denying God), into which he might
fall under outward and inward pressure (עשׁק). For he has round about
him those who do not keep God's law. On account of these apostates (על
לא as in [Isa 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md), equivalent to
על־אשׁר לא) his eyes run down rivers of water (ירד as in [Lam
3:48](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#048.md), with an accusative of the
object). His mood is not that of unfeeling self-glorying, but of sorrow
like that of Jeremiah, because of the contempt of Jahve, and the
self-destruction of those who contemn Him.

[Psalms 119:137](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#137.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137">psa 119:137</span></span>

The eightfold Tsade. God rules righteously and faithfully according to
His word, for which the poet is accordingly zealous, although young and
despised. The predicate ישׂר in [Psa
119:137](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#137.md) precedes its subject משׁפּטיך
(God's decisions in word and in deed) in the primary form (after the
model of the verbal clause [Psa
124:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#005).md), just as in German \[and
English\] the predicative adjective remains undeclined. The accusatives
צדק and אמוּנה in [Psa 119:138](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#138.md) are not
predicative (Hitzig), to which the former ("as righteousness") - not the
latter however - is not suited, but adverbial accusatives (in
righteousness, in faithfulness), and מאד according to its position is
subordinate to ואמונה as a virtual adjective (cf. [Isa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009).md): the requirements of the
revealed law proceed from a disposition towards and mode of dealing with
men which is strictly determined by His holiness (צדק), and beyond
measure faithfully and honestly designs the well-being of men (אמונה
מאד). To see this good law of God despised by his persecutors stirs the
poet up with a zeal, which brings him, from their side, to the brink of
extreme destruction ([Psa 69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010.md), cf.
צמתּת, [Psa 88:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#017).md). God's own
utterance is indeed without spot, and therefore not to be carped at; it
is pure, fire-proved, noblest metal ([Psa
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md); [Psa
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#007).md), therefore he loves it, and does
not, though young (lxx νεώτερος, Vulgate adolescentulus) and lightly
esteemed, care for the remonstrances of his proud opponents who are old
and more learned than himself (the organization of [Psa
119:141](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#141.md) is like [Psa
119:95](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#095), and frequently.md). The
righteousness (צדקה) of the God of revelation becomes eternal
righteousness (צדק), and His law remains eternal truth (אמת). צדקה is
here the name of the attribute and of the action that is conditioned in
accordance with it; צדק the name of the state that thoroughly accords
with the idea of that which is right. So too in [Psa
119:144](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#144.md) : צדק are Jahve's testimonies
for ever, so that all creatures must give glory to their harmony with
that which is absolutely right. To look ever deeper and deeper into this
their perfection is the growing life of the spirit. The poet prays for
this vivifying insight.

[Psalms 119:145](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#145.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_145">psa 119:145</span></span>

The eightfold Koph. Fidelity to God's word, and deliverance according to
His promise, is the purport of his unceasing prayer. Even in the morning
twilight (נשׁף) he was awake praying. It is not הנּשׁף, I anticipated
the twilight; nor is קדּמתּי, according to [Psa
89:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#014.md), equivalent to קדמתיך, but
ואשׁוּע...קדּמתּי is the resolution of the otherwise customary
construction קדמתי לשׁוּע, [Jon 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002.md),
inasmuch as קדּם may signify "to go before" ([Psa
68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026).md), and also "to make haste (with
anything):" even early before the morning's dawn I cried. Instead of
לדבריך the Ker (Targum, Syriac, Jerome) more appropriately reads לדברך
after [Psa 119:74](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#074.md), [Psa
119:81](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081.md), [Psa
119:114](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#114.md). But his eyes also anticipated
the night-watches, inasmuch as they did not allow themselves to be
caught not sleeping by any of them at their beginning (cf. לראשׁ, [Lam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019).md). אמרה is here, as in [Psa
119:140](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#140.md), [Psa
119:158](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#158.md), and frequently, the whole
word of God, whether in its requirements or its promises. In [Psa
119:149](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#149.md) בּמשׁפּטך is a defective
plural as in [Psa 119:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#043.md) (vid., on
[Psa 119:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#037).md), according to [Psa
119:156](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#156.md), although according to [Psa
119:132](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#132.md) the singular (lxx, Targum,
Jerome) would also be admissible: what is meant is God's order of
salvation, or His appointments that relate thereto. The correlative
relation of [Psa 119:150](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#150.md) and [Psa
119:151](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#151.md) is rendered natural by the
position of the words. With קרבוּ (cf. קרב) is associated the idea of
rushing upon him with hostile purpose, and with קרוב, as in [Psa
69:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#019.md); [Isa
58:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#002.md), of hastening to his succour.
זמּה is infamy that is branded by the law: they go forth purposing this,
but God's law is altogether self-verifying truth. And the poet has long
gained the knowledge from it that it does not aim at merely temporary
recompense. The sophisms of the apostates cannot therefore lead him
astray. יסדתּם for יסדתּן, like המּה in [Psa
119:111](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#111.md).

[Psalms 119:153](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#153.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_153">psa 119:153</span></span>

The eightfold Resh. Because God cannot suffer those who are faithful to
His word to succumb, he supplicates His help against his persecutors.
ריבה is Milra before the initial (half-guttural) Resh, as in [Psa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md); [Psa
74:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022.md). The Lamed of לאמרתך is the
Lamed of reference (with respect to Thine utterance), whether the
reference be normative (= כאמרתך, [Psa
119:58](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#058).md), as in [Isa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003.md), or causal, [Isa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002.md), [Isa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005.md); [Job
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005.md). The predicate רחוק, like ישׂר in
[Psa 119:137](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#137.md), stands first in the
primary, as yet indefinite form. Concerning [Psa
119:156](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#156.md) vid., on [Psa
119:149](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#149.md). At the sight of the faithless
he felt a profound disgust; ואתקוטטה, pausal aorist, supply בּהם, [Psa
139:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#021.md). It is all the same in the end
whether we render אשׁר quippe qui or siquidem. ראשׁ in [Psa
119:160](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#160.md) signifies the head-number of
sum. If he reckons up the word of God in its separate parts and as a
whole, truth is the denominator of the whole, truth is the sum-total.
This supplicatory חיּני is repeated three times in this group. The
nearer it draws towards its end the more importunate does the Psalm
become.

[Psalms 119:161](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#161.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_161">psa 119:161</span></span>

The eightfold ש (both Shin and Sin)

(Note: Whilst even in the oldest alphabetical Pijutim the Sin perhaps
represents the Samech as well, but never the Shin, it is the reverse in
the Biblical alphabetical pieces. Here Sin and Shin coincide, and Samech
is specially represented.)).

In the midst of persecution God's word was still his fear, his joy, and
his love, the object of his thanksgiving, and the ground of his hope.
Princes persecute him without adequate cause, but his heart does not
fear before them, but before God's words (the Ker likes the singular, as
in [Psa 119:147](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#147).md), to deny which would
be to him the greatest possible evil. It is, however, a fear that is
associated with heartfelt joy ([Psa
119:111](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#111).md). It is the joy of a conflict
that is rewarded by rich spoil ([Jdg
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030.md), [Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003).md). Not merely morning and evening,
not merely three times a day ([Psa
55:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#018).md), but seven times (שׁבע as in
[Lev 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018.md); [Pro
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016).md), i.e., ever again and again,
availing himself of every prayerful impulse, he gives thanks to God for
His word, which so righteously decides and so correctly guides, is a
source of transcendent peace to all who love it, and beside which one is
not exposed to any danger of stumbling (מכשׁול, lxx σκάνδαλον, cf. [Jo1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#010).md) without some effectual
counter-working. In [Psa 119:166](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#166.md) he
speaks like Jacob in [Gen 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018.md), and
can speak thus, inasmuch as he has followed earnestly and untiringly
after sanctification. He endeavours to keep God's law most
conscientiously, in proof of which he is able to appeal to God the
Omniscient One. שׁמרה is here the 3rd praet., whereas in [Psa
86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002.md) it is imperat. The future of אהב
is both אהב and אהב, just as of אחז both אחז and אאחז.

[Psalms 119:169](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#169.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_169">psa 119:169</span></span>

The eightfold Tav. May God answer this his supplication as He has heard
his praise, and interest Himself on behalf of His servant, the sheep
that is exposed to great danger. The petitions "give me understanding"
and "deliver me" go hand-in-hand, because the poet is one who is
persecuted for the sake of his faith, and is just as much in need of the
fortifying of his faith as of deliverance from the outward restraint
that is put upon him. רנּה is a shrill audible prayer; תּחנּה, a fervent
and urgent prayer. ענה, prop. to answer, signifies in [Psa
119:172](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#172.md) to begin, strike up, attune
(as does ἀποκρίνεσθαι also sometimes). According to the rule in [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md) the poet bases his petition for
help upon the purpose of thankful praise of God and of His word. Knowing
how to value rightly what he possesses, he is warranted in further
supplicating and hoping for the good that he does not as yet possess.
The "salvation" for which he longs (תּאב as in [Psa
119:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#040.md), [Psa
119:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#020).md) is redemption from the evil
world, in which the life of his own soul is imperilled. May then God's
judgments (defective plural, as in [Psa
119:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#043.md), [Psa
119:149](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#149.md), which the Syriac only takes a
singular) succour him (יעזּרני, not יעזרני). God's hand, [Psa
119:173](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#173.md), and God's word afford him
succour; the two are involved in one another, the word is the medium of
His hand. After this relationship of the poet to God's word, which is
attested a hundredfold in the Psalm, it may seem strange that he can say
of himself תּעיתי כּשׂה אבד; and perhaps the accentuation is correct
when it does not allow itself to be determined by [Isa
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md), but interprets: If I have gone
astray - seek Thou like a lost sheep Thy servant. שׂה אבד is a sheep
that is lost (cf. אבדים as an appellation of the dispersion, [Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013).md) and in imminent danger of total
destruction (cf. [Psa 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#013.md) with [Lev
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#038).md). In connection with that
interpretation which is followed by the interpunction, [Psa
119:176](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#176.md) is also more easily connected
with what precedes: his going astray is no apostasy; his home, to which
he longs to return when he has been betrayed into by-ways, is beside the
Lord.
