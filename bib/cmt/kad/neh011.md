### [Nehemiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 11:1</span></span>

[Neh 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md) and [Neh
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#002.md) narrate the carrying out of
Nehemiah's resolution, [Neh 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#004.md), to
make Jerusalem more populous, and follow [Neh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md) as to matter, but the end of Neh
10 as to time. For while Nehemiah, after the completion of the wall, was
occupied with the thought of bringing into the thinly populated capital
a larger number of inhabitants, and had for this purpose convoked a
public assembly, that a list of the whole Israelite population of the
towns of Benjamin and Judah might be taken in hand, the seventh month of
the year arrived, in which all the people assembled at Jerusalem to
perform those acts of worship and solemnities (described Neh 8-10) in
which this month abounded. Hence it was not till after the termination
of these services that Nehemiah was able to carry out the measures he
had resolved on. For there can be no doubt that [Neh
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md) and [Neh
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#002.md) of the present chapter narrate
the execution of these measures. The statement that one in ten of all
the people was appointed by lot to dwell in Jerusalem, and the remaining
nine in other cities, and that the people blessed the men who showed
themselves willing to dwell at Jerusalem, can have no other meaning
than, that the inhabitants of Jerusalem were increased in this
proportion, and that this was consequently the measure which God had,
according to [Neh 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md), put it into
Nehemiah's heart to take. The statement taken by itself is indeed very
brief, and its connection with [Neh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md) not very evident. But the brevity
and abruptness do not justify Bertheau's view, that these two verses are
not the composition of Nehemiah himself, but only an extract from a
larger context, in which this circumstance was fully explained. For
Nehemiah's style not unfrequently exhibits a certain abruptness; comp.
e.g., the commencements of chs. 5 and 6, or the information [Neh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006.md), which are no less abrupt, and
which yet no one has conceived to be mere extracts from some other
document. Besides, as the connection between [Neh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md) and [Neh
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md) is interrupted by the relation of
the events of the seventh month, so, too, is the account of the building
of the wall, [Neh 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#017.md); [Neh
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#015.md)., and [Neh
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001.md), interrupted by the insertion of
occurrences which took place during its progress. The first sentence,
[Neh 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md), "And the rulers of the
people dwelt at Jerusalem," cannot be so closely connected with the
next, "and the rest of the people cast lots," etc., as to place the
rulers in direct contrast to the rest of the people, but must be
understood by its retrospect to [Neh
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#004.md), which gives the following
contrast: The rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem, but few of the
people dwelt there; to this is joined the next sentence: and the rest of
the people cast lots. The "rest of the people" does not mean the
assembled people with the exception of the rulers, but the people with
the exception of the few who dwelt at Jerusalem. These cast lots to
bring (להביא) one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem. The predicate, the holy
city, occurs here and [Neh 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#018.md) for
the first time. Jerusalem is so called, on the ground of the prophecies,
[Joe 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017.md) and [Isa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#002.md), because the sanctuary of God,
the temple, was there. בּערים means, in the other cities of Judah and
Benjamin. המּתנדּבים, those who showed themselves willing to dwell in
Jerusalem, is taken by most expositors in contrast to those who were
bound to do this in consequence of the decision of the lot; and it is
then further supposed that some first went to Jerusalem of their free
choice, and that the lot was then cast with respect to the rest. There
are not, however, sufficient grounds for this conclusion, nor yet for
the assumption that the decision of the lot was regarded as a
constraint. The disposal of the lot was accepted as a divine decision,
with which all had, whether willingly or unwillingly, to comply. All who
willingly acquiesced in this decision might be designated as מתנדּבים;
and these departed to Jerusalem accompanied by the blessings of the
people. Individuals are not so much meant, as chiefly fathers of
families, who went with their wives and children.

[Nehemiah 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 11:3</span></span>

The inhabitants of Jerusalem and the other cities. - [Neh
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#003.md) The title reads: "These are the
heads of the province who dwelt at Jerusalem; and in the cities of Judah
dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, Israel, the priests,
the Levites, the Nethinim, and the sons of Solomon's servants." המּדינה
is, as in [Ezr 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md), the land of Judah,
as a province of the Persian kingdom. The repetition of ישׁבוּ after
יהוּדה בּערי is not to be understood as contrasting those who dwelt in
the cities with the dwellers in Jerusalem in the sense of "but in the
cities of Judah dwelt," etc., but is here a mere pleonasm. Even the
enumeration of the different classes of inhabitants: Israel, the
priests, etc., clearly shows that no such contrast is intended; for
Israel, the priests, etc., dwelt not only in Jerusalem, but also,
according to [Neh 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#020.md), in the other
cities of Judah. And this is placed beyond all doubt by the contents of
the list following; the inhabitants of Jerusalem being enumerated vv.
4-24, and the inhabitants of the other cities of Judah and Benjamin,
[Neh 11:25-36](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025.md). If, however, this title
refers to the whole of the following list, it cannot, as Rambach and
others thought, contain only an enumeration of those who, in consequence
of the lot, had taken up their residence at Jerusalem, but must be
intended as a list of the population of the whole province of Judah in
the times of Ezra and Nehemiah. It seems strange that the title should
announce המּדינה ראשׁי, while in the list of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem are given, besides the heads, the numbers of their brethren,
i.e., of the individuals or fathers of families under these heads; and
that in the list of the inhabitants of the other cities, only
inhabitants of Judah and Benjamin are spoken of. Hence this statement
refers a potiori to the heads, including the houses and families
belonging to them, while in the case of the other cities it is assumed
that the inhabitants of each locality were under a head. With [Neh
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#004.md) begins the enumeration of the
heads dwelling in Jerusalem, with their houses; and the first clause
contains a special title, which affirms that (certain) of the children
of Judah and of the children of Benjamin dwelt at Jerusalem. On the
parallel list of the inhabitants of Jerusalem before the captivity, 1
Chron 9:2-34, and its relation to the present list, see the remarks on 1
Chron 9.

[Neh 11:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#004.md)

Of the children of Judah two heads: Athaiah of the children of Perez
(comp. [Ch1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#004).md), and Maaseiah of the
children of Shela. It has been already remarked on [Ch1
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#005.md), that השּׁלני is wrongly pointed,
and should be read השּׁלני. כּל־חזה is a proper name, as in [Neh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md). Athaiah and Maaseiah are not
further known. There were in all four hundred and sixty-eight
able-bodied men of the sons of Perez, i.e., four hundred and sixty-eight
fathers of families of the race of Perez, among whom are probably
included the fathers of families belonging to Shela, the younger brother
of Perez.

[Nehemiah 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 11:7</span></span>

Of the Benjamites there were two heads of houses: Sallu, and after him
Gabbai-Sallai, with nine hundred and twenty-eight fathers of families.
Their chief was Joel the son of Zichri, and Jehuda the son of Sennah
over the city as second (prefect).

[Nehemiah 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 11:10</span></span>

Of the priests: Jedaiah, Joiarib, and Jachin, three heads of houses,
therefore of orders of priests (for בּן before Joiarib probably crept
into the text by a clerical error; see rem. on [Ch1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010).md); Seraiah, a descendant of
Ahitub, as ruler of the house of God, and their brethren, i.e., the
eight hundred and twenty-two ministering priests belonging to these
three orders. Also Adaiah, of the house or order of Malchiah, and his
brethren, two hundred and forty-two fathers of families; and lastly,
Amashai, of the order of Immer, with one hundred and twenty-eight
brethren, i.e., priests. And their chief was Zabdiel ben Haggedolim (lxx
υἱὸς τῶν μεγάλων). עליהם refers to all the before-named priests. לעבות
ראשׁים heads of fathers, i.e., of families, [Neh
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#013.md), is striking, for the brethren
of Adaiah (אחיו), in number two hundred and forty-two, could not be
heads of houses, but only fathers of families. The words seem to have
come into the text only by comparing it with [Ch1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#013.md). If they were genuine, we should
be obliged to understand לעבות ראשׁים of fathers of families, contrary
to general usage.

[Nehemiah 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 11:15</span></span>

Of Levites, Shemaiah, a descendant of Bunni, with the members of his
house; Shabbethai and Jozabad, "of the heads of the Levites over the
outward business of the house of God," i.e., two heads of the Levites
who had the care of the outward business of the temple, probably charged
with the preservation of the building and furniture, and the office of
seeing that all things necessary for the temple worship were duly
delivered. The names Shabbethai and Jozabad have already occurred, [Neh
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#007.md), as those of two Levites, and are
here also personal names of heads of Levites, as the addition הלויּם
מראשׁי informs us. As the office of these two is stated, so also is that
of those next following in [Neh 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017.md);
whence it appears that Shemaiah, of whom no such particular is given,
was head of the Levites charged with attending on the priests at the
sacrificial worship (the האלהים בּית מלאכת, [Neh
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022).md). The three named in [Neh
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017.md), Mattaniah an Asaphite,
Bakbukiah, and Abda a Jeduthunite, are the chiefs of the three Levitical
orders of singers. Mattaniah is called התּחלּה ראשׁ, head of the
beginning, which gives no meaning; and should probably, as in the lxx
and Vulgate, be read התּהלּה ראשׁ: head of the songs of praise, - he
praised for who praised, i.e., sounded the Hodu for prayer; comp. [Ch1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005.md), where Asaph is called the chief
of the band of singers. He is followed by Bakbukiah as second, that is,
leader of the second band (מאחיו משׁנה like משׁנהוּ, [Ch1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005).md); and Abda the Jeduthunite, as
leader of the third. All the Levites in the holy city, i.e., all who
dwelt in Jerusalem, amounted to two hundred and eighty-four individuals
or fathers of families. The number refers only to the three classes
named [Neh 11:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#015.md). For the
gatekeepers are separately numbered in [Neh
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#019.md) as one hundred and seventy-two,
of the families of Akkub and Talmon.

[Nehemiah 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">neh 11:20</span></span>

Certain special remarks follow in [Neh
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#020.md). - [Neh
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#020.md) states that the rest of the
Israelites, priests, and Levites dwelt in all the (other) cities of
Judah, each in his inheritance. These cities are enumerated in [Neh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025.md).

[Neh 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#021.md)

The Nethinim dwelt in Ophel, the southern slope of Mount Moriah; see
rem. on [Neh 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#026.md). Their chiefs were
Zihah and Gispa. ציחה occurs [Ezr
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043.md), followed by חשׂוּפא, as head of
a division of Levites; whence Bertheau tries, but unsuccessfully, to
identify the latter name with גּשׁפּא. For it does not follow that,
because a division of Nethinim was descended from Hasupha, that Gishpa,
one of the chiefs of those Nethinim who dwelt on Ophel, must be the same
individual as this Hasupha.

[Neh 11:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022.md)

And the overseer (chief) of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi, the son
of Bani, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, in the business of the house
of God. The מלאכה of the house of God was the duty of the Levites of the
house of Shemaiah, [Neh 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#015.md). Hence
the remark in the present verse is supplementary to [Neh
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#015.md). The chiefs or presidents of the
two other divisions of Levites - of those to whom the outward business
was entrusted, and of the singers - are named in [Neh
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#016.md) and [Neh
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017.md); while, in the case of those
entrusted with the business of the house of God, [Neh
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#015.md), the chiefs are not named,
probably because they were over the singers, the sons of Asaph, who in
[Neh 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#015.md) had not as yet been named.
This is therefore done afterwards in [Neh
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022.md). מלאכת לנגד, coram opere, i.e.,
circa ea negotia, quae coram in templo exigenda erant (Burm. in Ramb.),
does not belong to המּשׁררים, but to הלויּם פּקיד: Uzzi was overseer of
the Levites in respect of their business in the house of God, i.e., of
those Levites who had the charge of this business. The reason of this is
thus given in [Neh 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#023.md) : "for a
command of the king was over them, and an ordinance was over the singers
concerning the matter of every day." עליהם refers to the Levites. "A
command of the king was over them" means: the king had commanded them.
This command was concerning בּיומו יום דּבר, the matter of every day.
The words stand at the end of the verse, because they refer to the two
subjects המּלך and אמנה. אמנה is an arrangement depending upon mutual
agreement, a treaty, an obligation entered into by agreement; comp. [Neh
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001.md). The meaning of the verse is: The
every-day matter was laid upon the Levites by the command of the king,
upon the singers by an agreement entered into. בּיומו יום דּבר, pensum
quotidianum, is correctly explained by Schmid: de rebus necessariis in
singulos dies. That we are not to understand thereby the contribution
for every day, the rations of food (Ramb., Berth.), but the duty to be
done on each day, is obvious from the context, in which not provisions,
but the business of the Levites, is spoken of; and Uzzi the Asaphite was
placed over the Levites in respect of their business in the house of
God, and not in respect of food and drink. The business of the Levites
in the house of God was determined by the command of the king; the
business of the singers, on the contrary, especially that one of the
singers should exercise a supervision over the services of the Levites
in worship, was made the matter of an אמנה, an agreement entered into
among themselves by the different divisions of Levites. The king is not
David, who once regulated the services of the Levites ([Ch1
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004)..md), but the Persian king
Artaxerxes, who is mentioned as המּלך in [Neh
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#024.md); and המּלך מצות undoubtedly
refers to the full power bestowed by Artaxerxes upon Ezra to order all
that concerned the worship of God at Jerusalem; [Ezr
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012.md).

[Neh 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#024.md)

Finally, the official is named who had to transact with the king the
affairs of the people, i.e., of the whole Jewish community in Judah and
Jerusalem. Pethahiah, a Jew of the descendants of Zerah, was at the
king's hand in all matters concerning the people. המּלך ליד can scarcely
be understood of a royal commissioner at Jerusalem, but certainly
designates an official transacting the affairs of the Jewish community
at the hand of the king, at his court.

[Nehemiah 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">neh 11:25</span></span>

The inhabitants of the towns of Judah and Benjamin. - The heads who,
with their houses, inhabited country districts are here no longer
enumerated, but only the towns, with their adjacent neighbourhoods,
which were inhabited by Jews and Benjamites; and even these are but
summarily mentioned.

[Neh 11:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025.md)

The districts inhabited by the children of Judah. "And with respect to
the towns in their fields, there dwelt of the sons of Judah in
Kirjath-arba and its daughters," etc. The use of אל as an introductory
or emphatic particle is peculiar to this passage, ל ,egassap being
elsewhere customary in this sense; comp. Ew. 310, a. אל denotes a
respect to something. חצרים, properly enclosures, signifies, according
to [Lev 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#031.md), villages, towns,
boroughs, without walls. שׂדות, fields, field boundaries. בּנותיה, the
villages and estates belonging to a town; as frequently in the lists of
towns in the book of Joshua. Kirjath-arba is Hebron, [Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002.md). Jekabzeel, like Kabzeel, [Jos
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021.md). חצריה, its enclosed places, the
estates belonging to a town, as in [Jos
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#045.md). Jeshua, mentioned only here,
and unknown. Moladah and Beth-phelet, [Jos
15:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#026.md). Hazar-shual, i.e.,
Fox-court, probably to be sought for in the ruins of Thaly; see rem. on
[Jos 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#028.md). Beersheba, now Bir es
Seba; see rem. on [Gen 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031.md). Ziklag,
at the ancient Asluj, see [Jos 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031.md).
Mekonah, mentioned only here, and unknown. En-rimmon; see rem. on [Ch1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#032.md). Zareah, Jarmuth, Zanoah, and
Adullam in the plains (see [Jos
15:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033).md), where were also Lachish and
Azekah; see on [Ch2 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#009.md). - In [Neh
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#030.md) the whole region then inhabited
by Jews is comprised in the words: "And they dwelt from Beer-sheba (the
south-western boundary of Canaan) to the valley of Hinnom, in
Jerusalem," through which ran the boundaries of the tribes of Benjamin
and Judah ([Jos 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008).md).

[Neh 11:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#031.md)

The dwellings of the Benjamites. [Neh
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#031.md) The children of Benjamin dwelt
from Geba to Michmash, Aija, etc. Geba, according to [Kg2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008.md) and [Jos
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#010.md), the northern boundary of the
kingdom of Judah, is the half-ruined village of Jibia in the Wady el
Jib, three leagues north of Jerusalem, and three-quarters of a league
north-east of Ramah (Er Ram); see on [Jos
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024). Michmash (מכמשׁ or מכמס.md), now
Mukhmas, sixty-three minutes north-east of Geba, and three and a half
leagues north of Jerusalem; see rem. on [Sa1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md). Aija (עיּא or עיּת, [Isa
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028).md), probably one with העי, [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md); [Jos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md)., the situation of which is still
a matter of dispute, Van de Velde supposing it to be the present Tell el
Hadshar, three-quarters of a league south-east of Beitin; while Schegg,
on the contrary, places it in the position of the present Tayibeh, six
leagues north of Jerusalem (see Delitzsch on Isa. at [Isa
10:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028), etc., translation.md), - a
position scarcely according with [Isa
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md)., the road from Tayibeh to
Michmash and Geba not leading past Migron (Makhrun), which is not far
from Beitin. We therefore abide by the view advocated by Krafft and
Strauss, that the ruins of Medinet Chai or Gai, east of Geba, point out
the situation of the ancient Ai or Ajja; see rem. on [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md). Bethel is the present Beitin; see
on [Jos 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md). The position of Nob is
not as yet certainly ascertained, important objections existing to its
identification with the village el-Isawije, between Anta and Jerusalem;
comp. Valentiner (in the Zeitschrift d. deutsch. morgld. Gesellsch. xii.
p. 169), who, on grounds worthy of consideration, transposes Nob to the
northern heights before Jerusalem, the road from which leads into the
valley of Kidron. Ananiah (ענניה), a place named only here, is
conjectured by Van de Velde (after R. Schwartz), Mem. p. 284, to be the
present Beit Hanina (Arab. hnı̂nâ), east of Nebi Samwil; against which
conjecture even the exchange of ע and ח raises objections; comp. Tobler,
Topographie, ii. p. 414. Hazor of Benjamin, supposed by Robinson
(Palestine) to be Tell 'Assur, north of Tayibeh, is much more probably
found by Tobler, Topographie, ii. p. 400, in Khirbet Arsr, perhaps
Assur, Arab. ‛ṣûr, eight minutes eastward of Bir Nebla (between Rama and
Gibeon); comp. Van de Velde, Mem. p. 319. Ramah, now er Rm, two leagues
north of Jerusalem; see rem. on [Jos
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025.md). Githaim, whither the
Beerothites fled, [Sa2 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#003.md), is not yet
discovered. Tobler (dritte Wand. p. 175) considers it very rash to
identify it with the village Katanneh in Wady Mansur. Hadid, Ἀδιδά, see
rem. on [Ezr 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#033.md). Zeboim, in a valley
of the same name ([Sa1 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#018).md), is not
yet discovered. Neballat, mentioned only here, is preserved in Beith
Nebala, about two leagues north-east of Ludd (Lydda); comp. Rob.
Palestine, and Van de Velde, Mem. p. 336. With respect to Lod and Ono,
see rem. on [Ch1 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012.md); and on the
valley of craftsmen, comp. [Ch1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#014.md).
The omission of Jericho, Gibeon, and Mizpah is the more remarkable,
inasmuch as inhabitants of these towns are mentioned as taking part in
the building of the wall ([Neh 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#002.md),
[Neh 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#007).md).

[Neh 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#036.md)

The enumeration concludes with the remark, "Of the Levites came
divisions of Judah to Benjamin," which can only signify that divisions
of Levites who, according to former arrangements, belonged to Judah, now
came to Benjamin, i.e., dwelt among the Benjamites.
