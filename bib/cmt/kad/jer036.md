### [Jeremiah Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 36:1</span></span>

In the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim the word of the Lord came
to Jeremiah, bidding him commit to writing all the addresses he had
previously delivered, that Judah might, if it were possible, still
regard the threatenings and return ([Jer
36:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001).md). In accordance with this
command, he got all the words of the Lord written down in a book by his
attendant Baruch, with the further instruction that this should be read
on the fast-day in the temple to the people who came out of the country
into Jerusalem ([Jer 36:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#004).md). When,
after this, in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim, a fast
was appointed, Baruch read the prophecies to the assembled people in the
chamber of Gemariah in the temple. Michaiah the son of Gemariah
mentioned the matter to the princes who were assembled in the royal
palace; these then sent for Baruch with the roll, and made him read it
to them. But they were so frightened by what was read to them that they
deemed it necessary to inform the king regarding it ([Jer
36:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009).md). At their advice, the king
had the roll brought and some of it read before him; but scarcely had
some few columns been read, when he cut the roll into pieces and threw
them into the pan of coals burning in the room, at the same time
commanding that Baruch and Jeremiah should be brought to him; but God
hid them ([Jer 36:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020).md). After this
roll had been burnt, the Lord commanded the prophet to get all his words
written on a new roll, and to predict an ignominious fate for King
Jehoiakim; whereupon Jeremiah once more dictated his addresses to Baruch
([Jer 36:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#027).md).

Since Jeremiah, according to [Jer
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#003.md), [Jer
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#006.md), [Jer
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md), is to get his addresses written
down that Baruch may be able to read them publicly on the fast-day, now
at hand, because he himself was prevented from getting to the temple,
the intention of the divine command was not to make the prophet put down
in writing and gather together all the addresses he had hitherto given,
but the writing down is merely to serve as a means of once more
presenting to the people the whole contents of his prophecies, in order
to induce them, wherever it was possible, to return to the Lord. In the
fourth year of Jehoiakim, Nebuchadnezzar, after vanquishing the
Egyptians at the Euphrates, advanced against Judah, took Jerusalem, and
made Jehoiakim tributary. In the same year, too, Jeremiah had delivered
the prophecy regarding the giving up of Judah and all nations for
seventy years into the power of the king of Babylon (Jer 25); this was
before he had been bidden write down all his addresses. For, that he did
not receive this command till towards the end of the fourth year, may be
gathered with certainty from the fact that the public reading of the
addresses, after they were written down, was to take place on the
fast-day, which, according to [Jer
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009.md), was not held till the ninth
month of the fifth year. The only doubtful point is, whether they were
written down and read before or after the first capture of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar. Most modern commentators take the former view; e.g.,
Hitzig says, briefly and decidedly, "According to [Jer
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029.md), the Chaldeans had not as yet
appeared in the country." But this is not mentioned in [Jer
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029.md). The threatening in this verse,
"The king of Babylon shall come and destroy this land, and exterminate
men and beasts from it," does not prove that the king of Babylon had not
yet come to Judah, but merely that the country had not yet been
destroyed, and men and cattle exterminated from it. When Jerusalem was
first taken, Nebuchadnezzar contented himself with subjecting Jehoiakim
under his supreme authority and requiring the payment of tribute, as
well as carrying away some of the vessels of the temple and some
hostages. The devastation of Judah and the extirpation of men and beasts
did not commence till the second subjugation of Jerusalem under
Jehoiakim, and was completed when the city was utterly destroyed, in
Zedekiah's time, on its third subjugation. The settlement of the
question that has been raised depends on the determination of the object
for which the special fast-day in the fifth year was appointed, whether
for averting the threatened invasion by the Chaldeans, or as a memorial
of the first capture of Jerusalem. This question we have already so far
decided in the Commentary on Daniel, at [Jer
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md), where it is stated that the fast
was held in remembrance of that day in the year when Jerusalem was taken
for the first time by Nebuchadnezzar; we have also remarked in the same
place, that Jehoiakim either appointed or permitted this special fast
"for the purpose of rousing the popular feeling against the Chaldeans,
to whom they were in subjection, - to evoke in the people a religious
enthusiasm in favour of resistance; for Jehoiakim keenly felt the
subjugation by the Chaldeans, and from the first thought of revolt."
However, every form of resistance to the king of Babylon could only
issue in the ruin of Judah. Accordingly, Jeremiah made Baruch read his
prophecies publicly to the people assembled in the temple on that day,
"by way of counterpoise to the king's desire;" the prophet also bade him
announce to the king that the king of Babylon would come, i.e., return,
to destroy the land, and to root out of it both men and beasts. These
circumstances give the first complete explanation of the terror of the
princes when they listened to the reading of the book ([Jer
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#016).md), as well as of the wrath of the
king, exhibited by his cutting the book in pieces and throwing it into
the fire: he saw that the addresses of the prophet were more calculated
to damp those religious aspirations of the people on which he based his
hopes, than to rouse the nation against continued submission to the
Chaldeans. Not till now, too, when the object of the appointment of the
fast-day was perceived, did the command given by God to the prophet to
write down his prophecies appear in its proper light. Shortly before,
and in the most earnest manner, Jeremiah had reminded the people of
their opposition to the word of God preached by him for twenty-three
years, and had announced to them, as a punishment, the seventy years'
subjugation to the Chaldeans and the desolation of the country; yet this
announcement of the fearful chastisement had made no deeper or more
lasting impression on the people. Hence, so long as the threatened
judgment was still in the distance, not much could be expected to result
from the reading of his addresses in the temple on the fast-day, so that
the command of God to do so should appear quite justified. But the
matter took a considerably different from when Nebuchadnezzar had
actually taken Jerusalem and Jehoiakim had submitted. The commencement
of the judgments which had been threatened by God was the proper moment
for laying before the hearts of the people, once more, the intense
earnestness of the divine message, and for urging them to deeper
penitence. Just at this point the reading of the whole contents of the
prophecies delivered by Jeremiah appears like a final attempt to
preserve the people, on whom judgment has fallen, from complete
destruction.

[Jeremiah 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 36:2</span></span>

The word of the Lord to Jeremiah was to this effect: "Take thee a
book-roll, and write on it (אליה for עליה) all the words that I have
spoken unto thee concerning Israel and Judah, and concerning all the
nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah till
this day. [Jer 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#003.md). Perhaps the house
of Judah will hear all the evil which I meditate doing to them, that
they may return every one from his evil way, and that I may forgive
their iniquity and their sin." ישׁמעוּ here means, to hear correctly and
lay to heart; cf. [Jer 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#003.md). Hitzig
views the command as meaning, not that Jeremiah is now for the first
time to write down his addresses (which would be an impossibility for
the most faithful memory), but that he is merely to write them down
together in one book, out of the several scattered leaves and scraps.
Graf has already refuted this view, though more fully than was
necessary. It is not a copying, word for word, of every separate address
that is meant, but merely a writing down of the essential contents of
all his oral discourses. This is quite clear, not merely from what is
stated in [Jer 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#003.md) as the object of
this command, but also from the character of these collected addresses,
as they are preserved to us. That the expression "all the words" is not
to be understood in the most rigid sense, follows from the very fact
that, when Jeremiah anew wrote down his prophecies, [Jer
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#032.md), he further added "many similar
words" to what had been contained in the first book-roll, which was
burned by Jehoiakim. But Jeremiah might perhaps be able to retain in his
memory the substance of all the addresses he had delivered during the
twenty-three years, since all of them treated of the same subjects -
reproof of prevailing sins, threat of punishment, and promises.

[Jeremiah 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 36:4</span></span>

Jeremiah carries out the divine command by making Baruch write down on a
book-roll all the words of the Lord, out of his mouth ('מפּי , i.e., at
the dictation of Jeremiah); and since he himself is prevented from
getting to the house of the Lord, he bids him read the words he had
written down in the ears of the people in the temple on the fast-day, at
the same time expressing the hope, [Jer
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md) : "Perhaps their supplication
will fall down before the Lord, and they will return each one from his
wicked way; for great is the wrath and the anger which the Lord hath
expressed concerning this people." Baruch, who is mentioned so early as
[Jer 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012.md). as the attendant of the
prophet, was, according to the passage now before us, his amanuensis,
and executed his commissions. אני עצוּר, according to [Jer
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001.md) and [Jer
39:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015.md), might mean, "I am in prison;"
but this does not accord with the request of the princes, [Jer
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#019.md), that Jeremiah should hide
himself. Moreover, עצוּר does not mean "seized, captus," but "stopped,
restrained, hindered;" see on [Neh
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#010.md). The cause of hindrance is not
mentioned, as being away from the purpose of the narrative. "To read in
the roll in the ears of the people," i.e., to read to the people out of
the book. בּיום צום does not mean "on any fast-day whatever," but, "on
the fast-day." The article is omitted because there was no need for
defining the fast-day more exactly. The special fast-day mentioned in
[Jer 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009.md) is intended. 'תּפּל תּחנּתם
וגו, "their supplication will fall down before the Lord," i.e., reach
unto God, as if it were laid before His feet. נפל is transferred from
the posture of the suppliant - his falling down before God - to his
supplication. Hence, in Hiphil, to make the supplication fall down
before the Lord is equivalent to laying the request at His feet; [Jer
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#026.md); [Jer
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#009.md); [Dan
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018.md), [Dan
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020.md). If the supplication actually
comes before God, it is also heard and finds success. This success is
pointed out in 'וישׁבוּ וגו, "that they may repent." If man, in a
repentant spirit, supplicates God for grace, God grants him power for
conversion. But the return of the people from their wicked way is
indispensable, because the wrath which God has expressed concerning it
is great, i.e., because God has threatened a heavy judgment of wrath.

[Jeremiah 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 36:8</span></span>

Baruch executes his commission.

[Jer 36:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009.md)

The reading of the book in the temple. - [Jer
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009.md). In the fifth year of Jehoiakim,
in the ninth month, "they proclaimed a fast before the Lord - all the
people in Jerusalem, and all the people who had come out of the cities
of the Judah to Jerusalem." קתא צום, to call, declare, appoint a fast;
cf. [Kg1 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#009.md), [Kg1
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#012.md); [Ch2
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003.md). From the tenor of the words, the
people who lived in Jerusalem and those who had come thither out of the
country might seem to have called the fast. But this is impossible; for
the people from the cities of Judah evidently came to Jerusalem only in
consequence of the fast being appointed. Hence Graf is of opinion that
קתא צום seems here used in a general way of the keeping of such a fast.
This view is not confirmed by any parallel instances. The expression is
inexact, and the inexactness has arisen from the effort to attain
greater conciseness of expression. The meaning is this: a fast was
proclaimed, and all the people in Jerusalem and out of the cities of
Judah came to worship the Lord in the temple. It remains doubtful with
whom the appointment originated, - whether with the king, or with the
high priest and the priesthood. The ninth month corresponds to our
December, and consequently came round with the cold season; cf. [Jer
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022.md). The fast-day was a special one;
for in the law only the day of atonement, in the seventh month, was
prescribed as a fast-day. On the object of this measure, see supra, p.
316f.

[Jer 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010.md)

On this day Baruch read the addresses of Jeremiah out of the book to the
people who had come to the temple, in the "chamber of Gemariah, the son
of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper forecourt, at the entrance of the
new gate of the house of the Lord." Gemariah the son of Shaphan was one
of the king's private scribes, a secretary of state. For, according to
[Jer 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#012.md), he belonged to the
princes, and was probably a brother of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, who
had already shown himself, before this, a protector of the prophet ([Jer
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024).md). The chamber which he had in
the temple was situated in the upper forecourt, at the entrance of the
new gate, whose position we cannot exactly determine (see on [Jer
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#010).md), but which led from the outer
to the inner court of the priests, which rose higher than the others.

[Jer 36:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#011.md)

Micaiah, a son of Gemariah, was also listening to the reading; and he it
was who brought the news into the palace. He made of the room, i.e., the
office, of Elishama, the secretary of state, where the princes, viz.,
Elishama, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor (cf.
[Jer 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#022).md), Gemariah the son of
Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, had just met for a
consultation; and he mentioned to them what he had heard.

[Jer 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#014.md)

On this information the princes sent Jehudi (perhaps one of the
under-officers of the secretary of state) to Baruch, to bring him, with
the book from which he had read. From the designation, "Jehudi son of
Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi," Hitzig and Graf conclude
that the first and last are not proper names, but appellatives, "the
Jew" and "the Cushite," and account for the use of them on the ground
that, through the application of the law given in [Deu
23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007.md) to Cushites as well as
Egyptians, the ancestor was a Cushite, and only his great-grandson
became a Jew, or Jewish citizen, and was called "Jehudi." But this view
is opposed (1) by the fact that the names of the father and the
grandfather are true proper names, and these, moreover, contain the name
Jah (Jahveh), - hence are genuine proper names of Israelites; moreover,
(2) even in olden times Jehudith occurs as a woman's name, [Gen
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034.md). According to this, Jehudi is a
true proper name, and at the most, Cushi is but a surname of the
great-grandfather, given him because of his descent from the Cushites.
Further, the law, [Deu 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007.md), applies
only to the posterity of the Edomites and Egyptians, that these should
not be received into the congregation of the Lord till the third
generation; this ordinance was based on grounds which did not permit of
its application to other nations. These might be naturalized even in the
first generation on undergoing circumcision, with the exception of
Canaanites, Ammonites, and Moabites, who were not to be admitted into
the Israelitish community even in the tenth generation, [Deu
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md).

[Jer 36:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#015.md)

When Baruch came, the princes, in token of friendly and respectful
treatment, bade him sit down and read to them out of the book he had
brought with him. [Jer 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#016.md). But when
they heard all the words read, "they were afraid one at another;" i.e.,
by looks, gestures, and words, they gave mutual expression of their
fear, partly because of the contents of what had been read. Although
they were generally acquainted with the sense and the spirit of
Jeremiah's addresses, yet what had now been read made a powerful
impression on them; for Baruch plainly had read, both to the people in
the temple and to the princes, not the whole book, but only the main
portions, containing the sternest denunciations of sin and the strongest
threats of punishment. The statement, "he read in (out of) the book the
words of Jeremiah" ([Jer 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010).md), does
not mean that he read the whole book; this would only have wearied the
people and weakened the impression made. But they were partly also
terrified, perhaps, by the boldness of a declaration which so decidedly
opposed the desires and hopes of the king; for the thought of the event
mentioned in [Jer 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#020.md). would at once
suggest to them the danger that might arise to the live of Jeremiah and
Baruch from the despotic character of the king. They said therefore to
Baruch, "We must tell the king all these things." For it was clear that
the matter could not long remain concealed from the king, after the
public reading in the temple. Hence they dared not, agreeably to their
official relation to the king, hide from him what had taken place.

[Jer 36:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#017.md)

Meanwhile, in order to inform themselves more exactly regarding what had
happened, they ask Baruch, "Tell us, how hast thou written all these
words at his mouth?" Thereupon Baruch replied, "He used to call aloud
these words to me," i.e., he used to dictate them to me by word of
mouth, "and I wrote them in the book with ink." The imperfect expresses
the repeated or continued doing of anything; hence יקרא here means to
dictate, which requires considerable time. In the following
circumstantial clause is found the participle ואני כתב, while I was
writing; and so I myself was doing nothing else all the time than
writing down what was dictated. Some commentators have found a
stumbling-block in מפּיו in the question of the princes ([Jer
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#017).md); the lxx and Ewald omit this
word, inasmuch as Baruch does not explain till afterwards that he had
written down the words from the mouth of Jeremiah. Others, like Venema,
take מפּיו as a question = המפּיו. Both explanations are arbitrary and
unnecessary. The princes knew quite well that the substance of the book
was from the mouth of Jeremiah, i.e., contained his addresses; but
Baruch, too, might have composed the book from the oral discourses of
the prophet without being commissioned by him, without his knowledge
also, and against his will. Accordingly, to attain certainty as to the
share of the prophet in this matter, they ask him, and Baruch answers
that Jeremiah had dictated it to him.

[Jer 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#019.md)

Thereupon the princes advised Baruch to hide himself and Jeremiah; for
they know beforehand that Jehoiakim would put to death the witnesses of
the truth.

[Jeremiah 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 36:20</span></span>

The reading of the book before the king. - [Jer
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020.md). The princes betook themselves
to the king חצרה, into the inner fore-court (leaving the book-roll in
the chamber of the secretary of state), and gave him an account of the
matter. חצר is the inner court of the palace, in which the royal
dwelling-apartments are situated. הפקיד, to entrust a thing or person to
any one ([Jer 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007).md), hence to deposit,
preserve, [Isa 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md).

[Jer 36:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#021.md)

Thereupon the king makes Jehudi fetch the book, and causes it to be read
before himself and the assembled princes. עמד מעל, to stand over, since
the one who is standing before his master, while the latter is sitting,
overtops him; cf. [Gen 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#008.md). The king
was sitting, as is stated in [Jer
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022.md) by way of preparation for what
follows, in the winter-house, i.e., in that portion of the palace which
was erected for a winter residence, in the ninth month, i.e., during the
winter, and the pot of coals was burning before him. The rooms of
eastern houses have no stoves, but in the middle of the floor there is a
depression, in which is placed a sort of basin with burning coals, for
the purpose of heating the apartment: cf. Keil's Bibl. Archol. ii. 95,
S. 7. For the expression ואת־האח, "and as for the fire-pot, it was
burning before him," cf. Ewald, 277, d.

[Jer 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#023.md)

Now, "when Jehudi had read three or four columns, he the king cut it the
book-roll with a pen-knife and threw the pieces into the fire, in the
pot of coals, till the whole roll was consumed on the fire in the pot of
coals." דּלתות, properly "doors," are not leaves, but divisions of a
book. The opinion of Hitzig, that leaves are to be understood, and that
the Megillah, therefore, was not a roll, properly speaking, but a book
with leaves, cannot be substantiated. In the synagogues, the Jews even
at the present day, according to the ancient custom, use real rolls,
which are rolled up on a stick. On these the Scripture text is written,
though not in lines which occupy the whole breadth of the roll; the
whole space is divided into parts. "Scribebatur," says Buxtorf in
Institutione epistolari Hebr. p. 4, "volumen lineis, non per
longitudinem totius chartae aut pergamenti deductis, sed in plures areas
divisis, quomodo sunt latera paginarum in libris complicatis. Istae
propterea voce metaphoric vocanturדּלתותjanuae valvae, quod figuram
januae referent." The subject of יקרעה is not Jehudi, as Hitzig thinks,
but the king, and the word does not signify "he cut it out," but "he cut
it in pieces" (the suffix refers to המּגלּה). We are not, with many
expositors, to view the conduct of the king in such a way as to think
that, whenever Jehudi had read some portions, he cut these off and threw
them into the fire, so that the book was, with these interruptions, read
through to the end, and at the same time gradually destroyed. Such
conduct Graf justly characterizes as trifling and silly, and not in
harmony with the anger of a king having a violent disposition. But we
cannot see how the imperfect יקרע (in Ngelsbach's opinion) proves that
Jehudi read the whole, when the text states that only three or four
columns were read. The meaning, peculiar to the imperfect, of the
continuation or repetition of an act, is fully made out by supposing
that the king cut down the roll bit by bit, and threw the pieces into
the fire one after the other. Neither does the expression עד־תּם
כּל־המּגלּה imply that the whole book was read; for תּמם does not denote
the completion of the reading, but the completion of the burning: hence
the words are to be translated, "till the whole roll had completely got
upon the fire," i.e., was completely burnt; cf. תּם אל־, [Gen
47:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#018.md). The inf. absol. והשׁלך is a
continuation of the finite verb, as frequently occurs, e.g., in [Jer
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#005.md); [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044.md).

[Jer 36:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#024.md)

In order to characterize the conduct of the king, the writer remarks,
"Yet the king and his servants who heard all these words (which Jehudi
had read) were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments (in token of
deep sorrow); and even when Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah addressed
the king, requesting him not to burn the roll, he did not listen to
them." So hardened was the king, that he and his servants neither were
terrified by the threatenings of the prophet, nor felt deep sorrow, as
Josiah did in a similar case ([Kg2
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#011.md), cf. [Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027).md), nor did they listen to the
earnest representations of the princes. עבדיו are the court-attendants
of the king in contrast with the princes, who, according to [Jer
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#016.md), had been alarmed by what they
heard read, and wished, by entreaties, to keep the king from the
commission of such a wicked act as the destruction of the book. Ewald,
on the contrary, has identified עבדיו with the princes, and thereby
marred the whole account, while he reproaches the princes with "acting
as the wretched instruments of what they knew to be the sentiments
prevailing at court."

[Jer 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026.md)

Not content with destroying the book, Jehoiakim also wished to get
Baruch and Jeremiah out of the way; for he ordered the king's son
Jerahmel and two other men to go for Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the
prophet; "but the Lord hid them," i.e., graciously kept them out of the
sight of the spies. בּן־המּלך is not the son of Jehoiakim, - if so, we
would find simply את־בּנו; but a royal prince is meant, cf. [Jer
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006.md); [Kg1
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026.md); [Kg2
11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001.md); [Zep
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#008.md).

The punishment which is to come on Jehoiakim for his wicked act. - [Jer
36:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#027.md). After the burning of the roll
by the king, Jeremiah received from the Lord the command to get all that
had been on the former roll written on another, and to announce the
following to Jehoiakim the king: [Jer
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029.md). "Thus saith Jahveh: Thou hast
burned this roll, whilst thou sayest, Why hast thou written thereon, The
king of Babylon shall surely come and destroy this land, and root out
man and beast from it? [Jer 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030.md).
Therefore thus saith Jahveh regarding Jehoiakim the king of Judah: He
shall not have one who sits upon the throne of David, and his corpse
shall be cast forth to the heat by day and to the frost by night. [Jer
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#031.md). And I shall punish him, his
servants, and his seed for their iniquity, and bring on them and on all
the inhabitants of Judah and all the men of Judah all the evil which I
have spoken to them; but they did not hear." On the meaning of [Jer
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029.md) see p. 316, supra. The
threatening expressed in [Jer 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030.md).
is really only a repetition of what is given in [Jer
22:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018.md), and has already been
explained there. "There shall not be to him one who sits upon the throne
of David," i.e., he is not to have a son that shall occupy the throne of
David after him. This does not contradict the fact that, after his
death, his son Jehoiachin ascended the throne. For this ascension could
not be called a sitting on the throne, a reign, inasmuch as he was
immediately besieged in Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and compelled to
surrender after three months, then go into exile to Babylon. On [Jer
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#031.md) cf. [Jer
35:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#017.md); [Jer
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015.md).

[Jer 36:22-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022.md)

Thereupon Jeremiah made his attendant Baruch write all the words of the
former roll on a new one, "out of his mouth," i.e., at his dictation;
and to these he added many other words like them. כּהמּה, i.e., of like
import with those on the previous roll. Hence we perceive that on the
first roll there were written down not all the several addresses fully,
but only the most important parts of his oral announcements.
