### [Ezekiel Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 30:0</span></span>

The Day of Judgment upon Egypt - Ezekiel 30:1-19

Commencing with a call to lamentation, the prophet announces that the
Lord's day of judgment upon the nations is near at hand, and will burst
upon Egypt, and the nations in alliance with it ([Eze
30:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#002)). He then depicts in three
strophes, with the introductory words 'כּה אמר , the execution for this
judgment, namely: (a) the destruction of the might of Egypt and the
devastation of the land ([Eze 30:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006));
(b) the enemy by whom the judgment will be accomplished ([Eze
30:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#010)); and (c) the extermination
of the idols of Egypt, the conquest and demolition of its fortresses,
the slaughter of its male population, and the captivity of the daughters
of the land ([Eze 30:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013)).

The heading does not contain any chronological information; and the
contents furnish no definite criteria for determining with precision the
date of the prophecy. Jerome assigns this oracle to the same period as
the prophecy in Ezekiel 29:1-16, whilst others connect it more closely
with [Eze 29:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017), and regard it as
the latest of all Ezekiel's prophecies. The latter is the conclusion
adopted by Rosenm׬ller, Hהvernick, Hitzig, Kliefoth, and some others.
The principal argument adduced for linking it on to [Eze
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017). is, that in [Eze
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#003) the day of judgment upon Egypt is
threatened as near at hand, and this did not apply to the tenth year
([Eze 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001)), though it was perfectly
applicable to the twenty-seventh ([Eze
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017)), when the siege of Tyre was
ended, and Nebuchadnezzar was on the point of attacking Egypt. But the
expression, "the day of the Lord is near at hand," is so relative a
chronological phrase, that nothing definite can be gathered from it as
to the date at which an oracle was composed. Nor does the fact that our
prophecy stands after the prophecy in [Eze
29:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017), which is furnished with a
date, prove anything; for the other prophecies which follow, and are
furnished with dates, all belong to a much earlier period. It is very
evident from this that [Eze 29:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017)
is inserted without regard to chronological sequence, and consequently
Ezekiel 30:1-19 may just as well belong to the period between the tenth
month of the tenth year ([Eze 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001))
and the first month of the eleventh year ([Eze
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020)), as to the twenty-seventh year
([Eze 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017)), since all the reasons
assigned for the closer connection of our prophecy with the one
immediately preceding ([Eze 29:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017)),
which is supposed to indicate similarity of date, are invalid; whilst,
on the other hand, the resemblance of [Eze
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006) and [Eze
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#017) to [Eze
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010) and [Eze
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#012) is not sufficient to warrant the
assumption of a contemporaneous origin.

[Ezekiel 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 30:1</span></span>

Announcement of the judgment upon Egypt and its allies. - [Eze
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001). And the word of Jehovah came to
me, saying, [Eze 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#002). Son of man,
prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Howl ye! Woe to the day!
[Eze 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#003). For the day is near, the
day of Jehovah near, a day of cloud, the time of the heathen will it be.
[Eze 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004). And the sword will come
upon Egypt, and there will be pangs in Ethiopia, when the slain fall in
Egypt, and they take her possessions, and her foundations are destroyed.
[Eze 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005). Ethiopians and Libyans and
Lydians, and all the rabble, and Chub, and the sons of the covenant
land, will fall by the sword with them. - In the announcement of the
judgment in [Eze 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#002) and [Eze
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#003), Ezekiel rests upon [Joe
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013), [Joe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015), and [Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002), where the designation already
applied to the judgment upon the heathen world by Obadiah, viz., "the
day of Jehovah" ([Oba 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#015)), is
followed by such a picture of the nearness and terrible nature of that
day, that even Isaiah ([Isa 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006), [Isa
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009)) and Zephaniah ([Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007), [Zep
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#014)) appropriate the words of Joel.
Ezekiel also does the same, with this exception, that he uses ההּ
instead of אההּ, and adds to the force of the expression by the
repetition of קרוב יום. In [Eze 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#003),
the words from יום ענן to יהיה are not to be taken together as forming
one sentence, "a day of cloud will the time of the nations be" (De
Wette), because the idea of a "time of the nations" has not been
mentioned before, so as to prepare the way for a description of its real
nature here. יום ענן and עת גּוים contain two co-ordinate affirmations
concerning the day of Jehovah. It will be a day of cloud, i.e., of great
calamity (as in [Joe 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002)), and a time
of the heathen, i.e., when heathen (גּוים without the article) are
judged, when their might is to be shattered (cf. [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022)). This day is coming upon Egypt,
which is to succumb to the sword. Ethiopia will be so terrified at this,
that it will writhe convulsively with anguish (חלחלה, as in [Nah
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011) and [Isa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003)). לקח המנהּ signifies the
plundering and removal of the possessions of the land, like נשׂא המנהּ
in [Eze 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#019). The subject to לקחוּ is
indefinite, "they," i.e., the enemy. The foundations of Egypt, which are
to be destroyed, are not the foundations of its buildings, but may be
understood in a figurative sense as relating to persons, after the
analogy of [Isa 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#010); but the notion
that Cush, Phut, etc. ([Eze 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009)),
i.e., the mercenary troops obtained from those places, which are called
the props of Egypt in [Eze 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006), are
intended, as Hitzig assumes, is not only extremely improbable, but
decidedly erroneous. The announcement in [Eze
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006), that Cush, Phut, etc., are to
fall by the sword along with the Egyptians (אתּם), is sufficient of
itself to show that these tribes, even if they were auxiliaries or
mercenaries of Egypt, did not constitute the foundations of the Egyptian
state and kingdom; but that, on the contrary, Egypt possessed a military
force composed of native troops, which was simply strengthened by
auxiliaries and allies. We there interpret יסדותיה, after the analogy of
[Psa 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003) and [Psa
82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005), as referring to the real
foundations of the state, the regulations and institutions on which the
stability and prosperity of the kingdom rest.

The neighbouring, friendly, and allied peoples will also be smitten by
the judgment together with the Egyptians. Cush, i.e., the Ethiopians,
Phut and Lud, i.e., the Libyans and African Lydians (see the comm. on
[Eze 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#010)), are mentioned here
primarily as auxiliaries of Egypt, because, according to [Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009), they served in Necho's army. By
כּל־הערב, the whole of the mixed crowd (see the comm. on [Kg1
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015) - πάντες οἱ ἐπίμικτοι, lxx), we
are then to understand the mercenary soldiers in the Egyptian army,
which were obtained from different nations (chiefly Greeks, Ionians, and
Carians, οἱ επίκουροι, as they are called by Herodotus, iii. 4, etc.).
In addition to these, כּוּב ,eseht (ἁπ λεγ.) is also mentioned. Hvernick
connects this name with the people of Kufa, so frequently met with on
the Egyptian monuments. But, according to Wilkinson (Manners, etc., I 1,
pp. 361ff.), they inhabited a portion of Asia farther north even than
Palestine; and he ranks them (p. 379) among the enemies of Egypt. Hitzig
therefore imagines that Kufa is probably to be found in Kohistan, a
district of Media, from which, however, the Egyptians can hardly have
obtained mercenary troops. And so long as nothing certain can be
gathered from the advancing Egyptological researches with regard to the
name Cub, the conjecture that כּוּב is a mis-spelling for לוּב is not to
be absolutely set aside, the more especially as this conjecture is
naturally suggested by the לוּבים of [Nah
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#009) and [Ch2
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#008), and the form לוּב by the side of
לוּבים is analogous to לוּד by the side of לוּדים in [Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009), whilst the Liby-Aegyptii of the
ancients, who are to be understood by the term לוּבים (see the comm. on
[Gen 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013)), would be quite in keeping
here. On the other hand, the conjecture offered by Gesenius (Thes. p.
664), viz., נוּב, Nubia, has but a very weak support in the Arabic
translator; and the supposition that לוּב may have been the earlier
Hebrew form for Nubia (Hitzig), is destitute of any solid foundation.
Maurer suggests Cob, a city (municipium) of Mauretania, in the Itiner.
Anton. p. 17, ed. Wessel. - The following expression, "sons of the
covenant land," is also obscure. Hitzig has correctly observed, that it
cannot be synonymous with בּעלי , their allies. But we certainly cannot
admit that the covenant land (made definite by the article) is Canaan,
the Holy Land (Hitzig and Kliefoth); although Jerome writes without
reserve, de filiis terrae foederis, i.e., de populo Judaeorum; and the
lxx in their translation, καὶ τῶν υιῶν τῆς διαθήκης μου, undoubtedly
thought of the Jews, who fled to Egypt, according to Theodoret's
exposition, along with Jeremiah after the destruction of Jerusalem and
the murder of the governor Gedaliah, for fear of the vengeance of the
Chaldeans (Jer 42-43, and 44). For the application of the expression
"land of the covenant" to the Holy Land is never met with either in the
Old or New Testament, and cannot be inferred, as Hitzig supposes, from
[Psa 74:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#020) and [Dan
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028), or supported in any way from
either the epithet "the land of promise" in [Heb
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009), or from [Act
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025), where Peter calls the Jews "the
children of the prophets and of the covenant." We therefore agree with
Schmieder in regarding ארץ as signifying a definite region, though one
unknown to us, in the vicinity of Egypt, which was inhabited by a tribe
that was independent of the Egyptians, yet bound to render help in time
of war.

[Ezekiel 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 30:6</span></span>

All the supports and helpers of Egypt will fall, and the whole land with
its cities will be laid waste. - [Eze
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006). Thus saith the Lord Jehovah,
Those who support Egypt will fall, and its proud might will sink; from
Migdol to Syene will they fall by the sword therein, is the saying of
the Lord Jehovah. [Eze 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#007). And they
will lie waste in the midst of waste lands, and its cities be in the
midst of desolate cities. [Eze 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#008).
They shall learn that I am Jehovah, when I bring fire into Egypt, and
all its helpers are shattered. [Eze
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009). In that day will messengers go
forth from me in ships to terrify the confident Ethiopia, and there will
be writing among them as in the day of Egypt; for, behold, it cometh. -
"Those who support Egypt" are not the auxiliary tribes and allies, for
they are included in the term עזריה in [Eze
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#008), but the idols and princes ([Eze
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013)), the fortified cities ([Eze
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#015)), and the warriors ([Eze
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#017)), who formed the foundation of
the might of the kingdom. גּאון , "the pride of its might," which is an
expression applied in [Eze 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021) to
the temple at Jerusalem, is to be taken here in a general sense, and
understood not merely of the temples and idols of Egypt, but as the sum
total of all the things on which the Egyptians rested the might of their
kingdom, and on the ground of which they regarded it as indestructible.
For 'ממּגדּל וגו, see the comm. on [Eze
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010). The subject to יפּלוּ בהּ is
the 'סמכי מצר. [Eze 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#007) is almost a
literal repetition of [Eze 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#012); and
the subject to נשׁמּוּ is מצרים regarded as a country, though the number
and gender of the verb have both been regulated by the form of the noun.
The fire which God will bring into Egypt ([Eze
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#008)) is the fire of war. [Eze
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009). The tidings of this judgment of
God will be carried by messengers to Ethiopia, and there awaken the most
terrible dread of a similar fate. In the first hemistich, the prophet
has [Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002) floating before his
mind. The messengers, who carry the tidings thither, are not the warlike
forces of Chaldea, who are sent thither by God; for they would not be
content with performing the service of messengers alone. We have rather
to think of Egyptians, who flee by ship to Ethiopia. The messengers go,
מלפני, from before Jehovah, who is regarded as being present in Egypt,
while executing judgment there (cf. [Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001)). צים, as in [Num
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024) = ציּים ([Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030)), ships, trieres, according to
the Rabbins, in Hieron. Symm. on [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021), and the Targum on Num. (cf.
Ges. Thes. p. 1156). בּטח is attached to כּוּשׁ, Cush secure or
confident, equivalent to the confident Cush (Ewald, 287c). 'והיתה חלח,
repeated from [Eze 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004). בּהם, among
the Ethiopians. 'כּיום מצר, as in the day of Egypt, i.e., not the
present day of Egypt's punishment, for the Ethiopians have only just
heard of this from the messengers; but the ancient, well-known day of
judgment upon Egypt ([Exo 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#012).).
Ewald and Hitzig follow the lxx in taking כּיום for בּיום; but this is
both incorrect and unsuitable, and reduces 'בּיום מצר into a tame
repetition of בּיּום החוּא. The subject to הנּה באה is to be taken from
the context, viz., that which is predicted in the preceding verses ([Eze
30:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 30:10</span></span>

The executors of the judgment. - [Eze
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#010). Thus saith the Lord Jehovah,
And I will put an end to the tumult of Egypt through Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon. [Eze 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#011). He and his
people with him, violent of the nations, will be brought to destroy the
land; they will draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with
slain. [Eze 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#012). And I will make the
rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of wicked men, and lay waste
the land and its fulness by the hand of foreigners; I Jehovah have
spoken it. - המון cannot be understood as signifying either the
multitude of people only, or the abundance of possessions alone; for
השׁבּית is not really applicable to either of these meanings. They are
evidently both included in the המון, which signifies the tumult of the
people in the possession and enjoyment of their property (cf. [Eze
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#013)). The expression is thus
specifically explained in [Eze 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#011)
and [Eze 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#012). Nebuchadnezzar will
destroy the land with his men of war, slaying the people with its
possessions. עריצי, as in [Eze 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#007).
מוּבאים, as in [Eze 23:42](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#042). 'הריק וגו,
cf. [Eze 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#014), [Eze
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#028); 7. חלל...מלאוּ, as in [Eze
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#006). יארים, the arms and canals of
the Nile, by which the land was watered, and on which the fertility and
prosperity of Egypt depended. The drying up of the arms of the Nile must
not be restricted, therefore, to the fact that God would clear away the
hindrances to the entrance of the Chaldeans into the land, but embraces
also the removal of the natural resources on which the country depended.
מכר, to sell a land or people into the hand of any one, i.e., to deliver
it into his power (cf. [Deu 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030);
[Jdg 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#014), etc.). For the fact itself,
see [Isa 19:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004). For 'השׁמּתי וגו, see
[Eze 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#007).

Further Description of the Judgment

[Eze 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013). Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, I will exterminate the idols and cut off the deities from Noph,
and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt; and I put
terror upon the land of Egypt. [Eze
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#014). And I lay Pathros waste, and
bring fire into Zoan, and execute judgments upon No; [Eze
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#015). And I pour out my fury upon
Sin, the stronghold of Egypt, and cut off the multitude of No; [Eze
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#016). And I put fire in Egypt; Sin
will writhe in pain, and No will be broken open, and Noph - enemies by
day. [Eze 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#017). The men of On and
Bubastus will fall by the sword, and they themselves will go into
captivity. [Eze 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018). At Tachpanches
the day will be darkened when I shatter the yokes of Egypt there, and an
end will be put to its proud haughtiness; cloud will cover it, and its
daughters till go into captivity. [Eze
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#019). And thus I execute judgments
upon Egypt, that they may know that I am Jehovah. - Egypt will lose its
idols and its princes (cf. [Jer
46:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#025)). גּלּוּלים and אלילים are
synonymous, signifying not the images, but the deities; the former being
the ordinary epithet applied to false deities by Ezekiel (see the comm.
on [Eze 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004)), the latter traceable to
the reading of [Isa 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001). נף,
contracted from מנף, Manoph or Menoph = מף in [Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006), is Memphis, the ancient capital
of Lower Egypt, with the celebrated temple of Ptah, one of the principal
seats of Egyptian idolatry (see the comm. on [Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006) and [Isa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013)). In [Eze
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013) מארץ מצר' belongs to נשׂיא,
there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt, i.e., a native
prince. נתן יראה, to put fear upon (cf. [Eze
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#017)). From Lower Egypt Ezekiel
passes in [Eze 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#014) to Upper Egypt
(Pathros, see the comm. on [Eze
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#014)), which is also to be laid
waste, and then names several more of the principal cities of Lower
Egypt along with the chief city of Upper Egypt. צען, Egypt. Zane, Copt.
Jane, is the Τανίς, Tanis, of the Greeks and Romans, on the Tanitic arm
of the Nile, an ancient city of Lower Egypt; see the comm. on [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022) and [Isa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011). נא = נא אמון in [Nah
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008), probably "abode of Amon," Egypt.
P-amen, i.e., house of Amon, the sacred name of Thebes, the celebrated
royal city of Upper Egypt, the Διὸς πόλις ἡ μεγάλη of the Greeks (see
the comm. on [Nah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008)). סין
(literally, mire; compare the Aram. סין) is Πηλούσιον, Pelusium, which
derives its name from πηλός (ὠνόμασται ἀπὸ τοῦ πηλοῦ πηλός, Strab. xvii.
p. 802), because there were swamps all round. It was situated on the
eastern arm of the Nile, to which it gave its name, at a distance of
twenty stadia from the sea. The Egyptian name Pehromi also signifies
dirty, or muddy. From this the Arabs have made Elfarama; and in the
vicinity of the few ruins of the ancient Pelusium there is still a
castle called Arab. t, Tineh (compare the Chaldee טינא, clay, in [Dan
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#041)). Ezekiel calls it the "fortress
or bulwark of Egypt," because, as Strabo (l.c.) observes, "Egypt is
difficult of access here from places in the East;" for which reason
Hirtius (de bell. Al. c. 27) calls it "the key of Egypt," and Suidas
(s.v.) "the key both of the entrance and exit of Egypt." On the history
of this city, see Leyrer in Herzog's Encyclopaedia. In המון נא many of
the commentators find a play upon the name of the god אמון ([Jer
46:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#025)), the chief deity of Thebes,
which is possible, but not very probable, as we should not expect to
find a god mentioned again here after [Eze
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013); and הכרתּי would be
inappropriate. - In [Eze 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#016) Sin (=
Pelusium) is mentioned again as the border fortress, No (= Memphis) as
the capital of Upper Egypt, as all falling within the range of the
judgment. The expression נף צרי יומם has caused some difficulty and
given occasion to various conjectures, none of which, however, commend
themselves as either simple or natural explanations.

(Note: Ewald proposes to alter צרי into צדי (after the Aramaean),
"rust," and renders it: "Memphis will be eternal rust." But to this
Hitzig has very properly objected that in [Eze
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006), [Eze
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#011), rust is called חלאה; and that
even in [Psa 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003) יומם does not mean
perpetual or eternal. Hvernick proposes to explain צרים, from the
Aramaean zer', to rend or tear in pieces, "Memphis shall become
perpetual rents." To this also it may be objected, that צרים in Hebrew
has the standing meaning of oppressors; and that יומם, interdiu, is not
equivalent to perpetual; and still further, that the preposition ל could
not be omitted before צרי.)

As Hitzig has correctly observed, צרי יומם is the same as שׁדד בּצּהרים
in [Jer 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008), and is the opposite of
שׁדדי לילה in [Oba 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#005). The enemy who
comes by day, not in the night, is the enemy who does not shun open
attack. The connection with נף is to be explained by the same rule as
[Jer 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002), "the one basket - very good
figs." Memphis will have enemies in broad daylight, i.e., will be filled
with them. און = און, אן, in [Gen
41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045), [Gen
41:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#050) (Egyptian An, or Anu), is the
popular name of Heliopolis in Lower Egypt (see the comm. on [Gen
41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045)); and the form און (a vain
thing, or idol) is probably selected intentionally in the sense of an
idol-city (see the comm. on [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015)), because On-Heliopolis
(בּית־שׁמשׁ in [Jer 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013)) was from
time immemorial one of the principal seats of the Egyptian worship of
the sun, and possessed a celebrated temple of the sun, with a numerous
and learned priesthood (see the comm. on [Gen
41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045), ed. 2). פּי־בסת, i.e.,
βουβαστός (lxx), or βουβαστίν (Herod. ii. 59), Egyptian Pi-Pasht, i.e.,
the place of Pasht, so called from the cat-headed Bubastis or Pasht, the
Egyptian Diana, which was worshipped there in a splendid temple. It was
situated on the royal canal leading to Suez, which was begun by Necho
and finished under Ptolemy II, not far from its junction with the
Pelusiac arm of the Nile. It was the chief seat of the Nomos Bubastites,
was destroyed by the Persians, who demolished its walls (Diod. Sic. xvi.
51), and has entirely disappeared, with the exception of some heaps of
ruins which still bear the name of Tel Bastah, about seven hours'
journey from the Nile (compare Ges. Thes. pp. 1101ff., and Leyrer in
Herzog's Encyclopaedia, s.v.). The Nomos of Bubastis, according to
Herod. ii. 166, was assigned to the warrior-caste of Calasirians. The
בּחוּרים, the young military men, will fall by the sword; and הנּה, not
αἱ γυναῖκες (lxx and others), but the cities themselves, i.e., their
civil population as distinguished from the military garrison, shall go
into exile. This explanation of הנּה is commended by בּנותיה in [Eze
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018). תּחפנחס or תּחפּנחס ([Jer
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007)., [Eze
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001); [Eze
46:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#014)), and תּחפנס in [Jer
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016) (Chetib), is Τάφναι, Τάφνη (lxx),
or Δάφναι (Herod. ii. 30. 107), a frontier city of Egypt in the vicinity
of Pelusium, after the time of Psammetichus a fortification with a
strong garrison, where a palace of Pharaoh was also to be found,
according to [Jer 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#009). After the
destruction of Jerusalem, a portion of the Jews took refuge there, and
to them Jeremiah predicted the punishment of God on the conquest of
Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007).,
[Eze 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001).). In the case of השך the
reading varies; the printed Masora at [Gen
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#003) giving חשׂך as the reading to be
found in all the codices examined by the author of the Masora; whereas
many of the codices and printed editions have חשׁך, and this is adopted
in all the ancient versions. This is evidently the correct reading, as
חשׂך does not furnish an appropriate meaning, and the parallel passages,
[Eze 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#008); [Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010); [Joe
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004); [Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009), all favour חשׁך. The darkening of
the day is the phenomenal prognostic of the dawning of the great day of
judgment upon the nations (cf. [Joe
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010); [Joe
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004), [Joe
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015); [Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010), etc.). This day is to dawn upon
Egypt at Tachpanches, the border fortress of the land towards Syria and
Palestine, when the Lord will break the yokes of Egypt. These words
point back to [Lev 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013), where the
deliverance of Israel from the bondage of Egypt is called the breaking
in pieces of its yokes (see also [Eze
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#027)). That which took place then is
to be repeated here. The yokes which Egypt put upon the nations are to
be broken; and all the proud might of that kingdom is to be brought to
an end (גּאון עזּהּ, as in [Eze 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006)).
In [Eze 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018), היא, which stands at
the head in an absolute form, points back to בּתּחפנחס. The city
(Daphne) will be covered with cloud, i.e., will be overthrown by the
judgment; and her daughters, i.e., the smaller cities and hamlets
dependent upon her (cf. [Eze 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#046) and
[Eze 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#006)), will go into captivity in
the persons of their inhabitants. It follows from this that Daphne was
the chief city of a Nomos in Lower Egypt; and this is confirmed by the
circumstance that there was a royal palace there. If we compare the
threat in this verse, that in Tachpanches an end is to be put to the
proud might of Pharaoh, with the threatening words of [Jer
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#009)., to the effect that
Nebuchadnezzar would set up his throne at Tachpanches and smite Egypt,
it is evident that the situation of Daphne must at that time have been
such that the war between Egypt and Babylonia would necessarily be
decided in or near this city. These prophetic utterances cannot be
explained, as Kliefoth supposes, from the fact that many Jews had
settled in Daphne; nor do the contents of this verse furnish any proof
that Ezekiel did not utter this prophecy of his till after the Jews had
settled there ([Jer 43:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001) and 44).
[Eze 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#019) serves to round off the
prophecy.

Destruction of the Might of Pharaoh by Nebuchadnezzar

According to the heading in [Eze
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020), "In the eleventh year, in the
first (month), on the seventh of the month, the word of Jehovah came to
me, saying," this short word of threatening against Egypt falls in the
second year of the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, and, as [Eze
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021) clearly shows, after the army of
Pharaoh Hophra, which marched to the relief of Jerusalem, had been
defeated by the Chaldeans who turned to meet it ([Jer
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005), [Jer
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007)). If we compare with this the
date of the first prophecy against Egypt in [Eze
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001), the prophecy before us was
separated from the former by an interval of three months. But as there
is no allusion whatever in Ezekiel 29 to Pharaoh's attempt to come to
the relief of the besieged city of Jerusalem, or to his repulse, the
arrival of the Egyptian army in Palestine, its defeat, and its repulse
by the Chaldeans, seems to have occurred in the interval between these
two prophecies, towards the close of the tenth year.

[Eze 30:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021)

[Eze 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021). son of man, the arm of
Pharaoh the king of Egypt have I broken; and, behold, it will no more be
bound up, to apply remedies, to put on a bandage to bind it up, that it
may grow strong to grasp the sword. [Eze
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#022). Therefore thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Behold, I will deal with Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and will
break both his arms, the strong one and the broken one, and will cause
the sword to fall out of his hand. [Eze
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#023). And I will scatter the
Egyptians among the nations and disperse them in the lands, [Eze
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#024). And will strengthen the arms of
the king of Babylon, and give my sword into his hand, and will break the
arms of Pharaoh, so that he shall groan the groanings of a pierced one
before him. [Eze 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#025). I will
strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will
fall; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I give my sword into
the hand of the king of Babylon, that he may stretch it against the land
of Egypt. [Eze 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#026). I will scatter
the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them in the lands; and
they shall know that I am Jehovah. - The perfect שׁברתּי in [Eze
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021) is not a prophetic utterance of
the certainty of the future, but a pure preterite. This may be seen
"both from the allusion in [Eze 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021)
to the condition resulting from the shbr שׁבר, and also to the obviously
antithetical relation of [Eze 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#022),
in which future events are predicted" (Hitzig). The arm is a figurative
expression for power, here for military power, as it wields the sword.
God broke the arm of Pharaoh by the defeat which the Chaldeans inflicted
upon Pharaoh Hophra, when he was marching to the relief of besieged
Jerusalem. חבּשׁה is a present, as is apparent from the infinitive
clauses ('לתת וגו) which follow, altogether apart from הנּה; and חבשׁ
signifies to bind up, for the purpose of healing a broken limb, that
remedies may be applied and a bandage put on. לחזקהּ, that it may become
strong or sound, is subordinate to the preceding clause, and governs the
infinitive which follows. The fact that the further judgment which is to
fall upon Pharaoh is introduced with לכן (therefore) here ([Eze
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#022)), notwithstanding the fact that
it has not been preceded by any enumeration of the guilt which
occasioned it, may be accounted for on the ground that the causal לכן
forms a link with the concluding clause of [Eze
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021) : the arm shall not be healed,
so as to be able to grasp or hold the sword. Because Pharaoh is not to
attain any more to victorious power, therefore God will shatter both of
his arms, the strong, i.e., the sound one and the broken one, that is to
say, will smite it so completely, that the sword will fall from his
hand. The Egyptians are to be scattered among the nations, as is
repeated in [Eze 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#023) verbatim from
[Eze 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#012). God will give the sword
into the hand of the king of Babylon, and equip and strengthen him to
destroy the might of Pharaoh, that the latter may groan before him like
one who is pierced with the sword. This thought is repeated in [Eze
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#025) and [Eze
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#026) with an intimation of the
purpose of this divine procedure. That purpose it: that men may come to
recognise Jehovah as God the Lord. The subject to וידעוּ is indefinite;
and the rendering of the lxx is a very good one, καὶ γνώσονται πάντες.
