Hymn in Honour of the God of the Seven Days

With Bless, O my soul, Jahve, as Ps 103, begins this anonymous Psalms
104 also, in which God's rule in the kingdom of nature, as there in the
kingdom of grace, is the theme of praise, and as there the angels are
associated with it. The poet sings the God-ordained present condition of
the world with respect to the creative beginnings recorded in [Gen
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md); and closes with the wish that
evil may be expelled from this good creation, which so thoroughly and
fully reveals God's power, and wisdom, and goodness. It is a Psalm of
nature, but such as not poet among the Gentiles could have written. The
Israelitish poet stands free and unfettered in the presence of nature as
his object, and all things appear to him as brought forth and sustained
by the creative might of the one God, brought into being and preserved
in existence on purpose that He, the self-sufficient One, may impart
Himself in free condescending love - as the creatures and orders of the
Holy One, in themselves good and pure, but spotted an disorganized only
by the self-corruption of man in sin and wickedness, which
self-corruption must be turned out in order that the joy of God in His
works and the joy of these works in their Creator may be perfected. The
Psalm is altogether an echo of the heptahemeron (or history of the seven
days of creation) in [Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md).
Corresponding toe the seven days it falls into seven groups, in which
the מאד הנה־טוב of [Gen 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031.md) is
expanded. It is not, however, so worked out that each single group
celebrates the work of a day of creation; the Psalm has the commingling
whole of the finished creation as its standpoint, and is therefore not
so conformed to any plan. Nevertheless it begins with the light and
closes with an allusion to the divine Sabbath. When it is considered
that [Psa 104:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#008.md) is only with violence
accommodated to the context, that [Psa
104:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#018.md) is forced in without any
connection and contrary to any plan, and that [Psa
104:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032.md) can only be made intelligible
in that position by means of an artificial combination of the thoughts,
then the supposition of Hitzig, ingeniously wrought out by him in his
own way, is forced upon one, viz., that this glorious hymn has decoyed
some later poet-hand into enlarging upon it.

[Psalms 104:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 104:1</span></span>

The first decastich begins the celebration with work of the first and
second days. הוד והדר here is not the doxa belonging to God πρὸ παντὸς
τοῦ αἰῶνος ([Jde 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025).md), but the doxa
which He has put on ([Job 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#010).md) since
He created the world, over against which He stands in kingly glory, or
rather in which He is immanent, and which reflects this kingly glory in
various gradations, yea, to a certain extent is this glory itself. For
inasmuch as God began the work of creation with the creation of light,
He has covered Himself with this created light itself as with a garment.
That which once happened in connection with the creation may, as in [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013.md); [Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024.md); [Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007.md); [Jer
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012.md), and frequently, be expressed by
participles of the present, because the original setting is continued in
the preservation of the world; and determinate participles alternate
with participles without the article, as in [Isa
44:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024.md), with no other difference
than that the former are more predicative and the latter more
attributive. With [Psa 104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002.md) the poet
comes upon the work of the second day: the creation of the expanse
(רקיע) which divides between the waters. God has spread this out (cf.
[Isa 40:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022).md) like a tent-cloth ([Isa
54:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002).md), of such light and of such fine
transparent work; נוטה here rhymes with עטה. In those waters which the
"expanse" holds aloft over the earth God lays the beams of His upper
chambers (עליּותתו, instead of which we find מעלותיו in [Amo
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006.md), from עליּה, ascent, elevation,
then an upper story, an upper chamber, which would be more accurately
עלּיּה after the Aramaic and Arabic); but not as though the waters were
the material for them, they are only the place for them, that is exalted
above the earth, and are able to be this because to the Immaterial One
even that which is fluid is solid, and that which is dense is
transparent. The reservoirs of the upper waters, the clouds, God makes,
as the lightning, thunder, and rain indicate, into His chariot (רכוּב),
upon which he rides along in order to make His power felt below upon the
earth judicially ([Isa 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001).md), or in
rescuing and blessing men. רכוּב (only here) accords in sound with
כּרוּב, [Psa 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md). For [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md) also recalls this primary
passage, where the wings of the wind take the place of the
cloud-chariot. In [Psa 104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004.md) the lxx
([Heb 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007).md) makes the first substantive
into an accusative of the object, and the second into an accusative of
the predicate: Ὁ ποιῶν τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ πνεῦματα καὶ τοὺς λειτουργοὺς
αὐτοῦ πυρὸς φλόγα. It is usually translated the reverse say: making the
winds into His angels, etc. This rendering is possible so far as the
language is concerned (cf. [Psa 100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003.md)
Chethb, and on the position of the worlds, [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013.md) with [Psa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008).md), and the plural משׁרתיו is
explicable in connection with this rendering from the force of the
parallelism, and the singular אשׁ from the fact that this word has no
plural. Since, however, עשׂה with two accusatives usually signifies to
produce something out of something, so that the second accusative (viz.,
the accusative of the predicate, which is logically the second, but
according to the position of the words may just as well be the first,
[Exo 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#039.md); [Exo
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025.md), as the second, [Exo
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#023.md); [Exo
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#003.md); [Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md); [Ch2
4:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#018).md) denotes the materia ex qua,
it may with equal right at least be interpreted: Who makes His
messengers out of the winds, His servants out of the flaming or
consuming (vid., on [Psa 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005).md) fire
(אשׁ, as in [Jer 48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045), masc..md). And
this may affirm either that God makes use of wind and fire for special
missions (cf. [Psa 148:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008).md), or (cf.
Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, i. 325f.) that He gives wind and fire to His
angels for the purpose of His operations in the world which are effected
through their agency, as the materials of their outward manifestation,
and as it were of their self-embodiment,

(Note: It is a Talmudic view that God really makes the angels out of
fire, B. Chagiga, 14a (cf. Koran, xxxviii. 77): Day by day are the
angels of the service created out of the stream of fire (נהר דינור), and
sing their song of praise and perish.)

as then in [Psa 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md) wind and cherub
are both to be associated together in thought as the vehicle of the
divine activity in the world, and in [Psa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md) the angel of Jahve represents the
energy of the wind.

[Psalms 104:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 104:5</span></span>

In a second decastich the poet speaks of the restraining of the lower
waters and the establishing of the land standing out of the water. The
suffix, referring back to ארץ, is intended to say that the earth hanging
free in space ([Job 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007).md) has its
internal supports. Its eternal stability is preserved even amidst the
judgment predicted in [Isa 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016.md).,
since it comes forth out of it, unremoved from its former station, as a
transformed, glorified earth. The deep (תּהום) with which God covers it
is that primordial mass of water in which it lay first of all as it were
in embryo, for it came into being ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ δι ̓ ὕδατος ([Pe2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005).md). כּסּיתו does not refer to תהום
(masc. as in [Job 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#014).md), because then
עליה would be required, but to ארץ, and the masculine is to be explained
either by attraction) according to the model of [Sa1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#004).md), or by a reversion to the
masculine ground-form as the discourse proceeds (cf. the same thing with
עיר [Sa2 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#013.md), צעקה [Exo
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#006.md), יד [Eze
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009).md). According to [Psa
104:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006.md), the earth thus overflowed with
water was already mountainous; the primal formation of the mountains is
therefore just as old as the תהום mentioned in direct succession to the
תהו ובהו. After this, [Psa 104:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007.md)
describe the subduing of the primordial waters by raising up the dry
land and the confining of these waters in basins surrounded by banks.
Terrified by the despotic command of God, they started asunder, and
mountains rose aloft, the dry land with its heights and its low grounds
appeared. The rendering that the waters, thrown into wild excitement,
rose up the mountains and descended again (Hengstenberg), does not
harmonize with the fact that they are represented in [Psa
104:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006.md) as standing above the mountains.
Accordingly, too, it is not to be interpreted after [Psa
107:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#026) : they (the waters.md) rose
mountain-high, they sunk down like valleys. The reference of the
description to the coming forth of the dry land on the third day of
creation requires that הרים should be taken as subject to יעלוּ. But
then, too, the בקעות are the subject to ירדוּ, as Hilary of Poictiers
renders it in his Genesis, 5:97, etc.: subsidunt valles, and not the
waters as subsiding into the valleys. Hupfeld is correct; [Psa
104:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#008.md) is a parenthesis which affirms
that, inasmuch as the waters retreating laid the solid land bare,
mountains and valleys as such came forth visibly; cf. Ovid, Metam. i.
344: Flumina subsidunt, montes exire videntur.

[Psalms 104:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 104:8</span></span>

[Psa 104:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#008.md) continues with the words
אל־מקום (cf. [Gen 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009), אחד אל־מקום.md):
the waters retreat to the place which (זה, cf. [Psa
104:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026.md), for אשׁר, [Gen
39:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#020).md) God has assigned to them as
that which should contain them. He hath set a bound (גּבוּל, synon. חק,
[Pro 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#029.md); [Jer
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022).md) for them beyond which they may
not flow forth again to cover the earth, as the primordial waters of
chaos have done.

[Psalms 104:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 104:10</span></span>

The third decastich, passing on to the third day of creation, sings the
benefit which the shore-surrounded waters are to the animal creation and
the growth of the plants out of the earth, which is irrigated from below
and moistened from above. God, the blessed One, being the principal
subject of the Psalm, the poet (in [Psa
104:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010) and further on.md) is able to go
on in attributive and predicative participles: Who sendeth springs
בּנּחלים, into the wads (not: בּנחלים, as brooks). נחל, as [Psa
104:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010.md) shows, is here a synonym of
בּקעה, and there is no need for saying that, flowing on in the plains,
they grow into rivers. The lxx has ἐν φάραγξιν. חיתו שׂדי is doubly
poetic for חיּת השּׂדה. God has also provided for all the beasts that
roam far from men; and the wild ass, swift as an arrow, difficult to be
hunted, and living in troops (פּרא, Arabic ferâ, root פר, Arab. fr, to
move quickly, to whiz, to flee; the wild ass, the onager, Arabic himr
el-wahs, whose home is on the steppes), is made prominent by way of
example. The phrase "to break the thirst" occurs only here. עליהם, [Psa
104:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#012.md), refers to the מעינים, which
are also still the subject in [Psa
104:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#011.md). The pointing עפאים needlessly
creates a hybrid form in addition to עפאים (like לבאים) and עפיים. From
the tangled branches by the springs the poet insensibly reaches the
second half of the third day. The vegetable kingdom at the same time
reminds him of the rain which, descending out of the upper chambers of
the heavens, waters the waterless mountain-tops. Like the Talmud (B.
Ta‛anı̂th, 10a), by the "fruit of Thy work" (מעשׂיך as singular) Hitzig
understands the rain; but rain is rather that which fertilizes; and why
might not the fruit be meant which God's works (מעשׂיך, plural) here
below ([Psa 104:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024).md), viz., the
vegetable creations, bear, and from which the earth, i.e., its
population, is satisfied, inasmuch as vegetable food springs up as much
for the beasts as for man? In connection with עשׂב the poet is thinking
of cultivated plants, more especially wheat; לעבדת, however, does not
signify: for cultivation by man, since, according to Hitzig's correct
remonstrance, they do not say עבד העשׂב, and להוציא has not man, but
rather God, as its subject, but as in [Ch1
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#030), for the service (use.md) of man.

[Psalms 104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 104:14</span></span>

In the fourth decastich the poet goes further among the creatures of the
field and of the forest. The subject to להוציא is מצמיח. The clause
expressing the purpose, which twice begins with an infinitive, is
continued in both instances, as in [Isa
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009.md), but with a change of subject
(cf. e.g., [Amo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md); [Amo
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004).md), in the finite verb. On what is
said of wine we may compare [Ecc
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#019.md), Sir. 40:20, and more especially
Isaiah, who frequently mentions wine as a representative of all the
natural sources of joy. The assertion that משּׁמן signifies "before oil
= brighter than oil," is an error that is rightly combated by Bttcher in
his Proben and two of his "Gleanings,"

(Note: Proben, i.e., Specimens of Old Testament interpretation, Leipzig
1833, and Aehrenlese (Gleanings), referred to in the preface of these
volumes. - Tr.)

which imputes to the poet a mention of oil that is contrary to his
purpose in this connection wand inappropriate. Corn, wine, and oil are
mentioned as the three chief products of the vegetable kingdom (Luther,
Calvin, Grotius, Dathe, and Hupfeld), and are assumed under עשׂב in [Psa
104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md), as is also the case in other
instances where distinction would be superfluous, e.g., in [Exo
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#022.md). With oil God makes the
countenance shining, or bright and cheerful, not by means of
anointing-since it was not the face but the head that was anointed ([Mat
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#017).md), - but by the fact of its
increasing the savouriness and nutritiveness of the food. להצהיל is
chosen with reference to יצהר. In [Psa
104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md) לבב־אנושׁ does not stand after,
as in [Psa 104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md) (where it is לבב־
with Gaja on account of the distinctive), but before the verb, because
לבב as that which is inward stands in antithesis to פנים as that which
is outside. Since the fertilization of the earth by the rain is the
chief subject of the predication in [Psa
104:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#013.md), [Psa
104:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#016.md) is naturally attached to what
precedes without arousing critical suspicion. That which satisfies is
here the rain itself, and not, as in [Psa
104:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#013.md), that which the rain matures.
The "trees of Jahve" are those which before all others proclaim the
greatness of their Creator. אשׁר־שׁם refers to these trees, of which the
cedars and then the cypresses (ברושׁים, root בר, to cut) are mentioned.
They are places where small and large birds build their nests and lodge,
more particularly the stork, which is called the חסידה as being πτηνῶν
εὐσεβέστατον ζώων (Barbrius, Fab. xiii.), as avis pia (pietaticultrix in
Petronius, lv. 6), i.e., on account of its love of family life, on
account of which it is also regarded as bringing good fortune to a
house.

(Note: In the Merg& district, where the stork is not called leklek as it
is elsewhere, but charnuk\[ on account of its bill like a long horn
(Arab. chrn) standing out in front, the women and children call it Arab.
'bû sa‛d, "bringer of good luck." Like the חסידה, the long-legged
carrion-vulture (Vultur percnopterus) or mountain-stork, ὀρειπελαργός,
is called רחם (Arab. rḥm) on account of its στοργή.)

The care of God for the lodging of His creatures leads the poet from the
trees to the heights of the mountains and the hiding-places of the
rocks, in a manner that is certainly abrupt and that disturbs the sketch
taken from the account of the creation. הגּבהים is an apposition. יעל
(Arabic wa‛il) is the steinboc, wild-goat, as being an inhabitant of יעל
(wa‛l, wa‛la), i.e., the high places of the rocks, as יען, [Lam
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md), according to Wetzstein, is the
ostrich as being an inhabitant of the wa‛na, i.e., the sterile desert;
and שׁפן is the rock-badger, which dwells in the clefts of the rocks
([Pro 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#026).md), and resembles the marmot
- South Arabic Arab. tufun, Hyrax Syriacus (distinct from the African).
By שׁפן the Jewish tradition understand the coney, after which the
Peshto here renders it לחגסא (חגס, cuniculus). Both animals, the coney
and the rock-badger, may be meant in [Lev
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#005.md); [Deu
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#007.md); for the sign of the cloven hoof
(פּרסה שׁסוּעה) is wanting in both. The coney has four toes, and the
hyrax has a peculiar formation of hoof, not cloven, but divided into
several parts.

[Psalms 104:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 104:19</span></span>

The fifth decastich, in which the poet passes over from the third to the
fourth day, shows that he has the order of the days of creation before
his mind. The moon is mentioned first of all, because the poet wishes to
make the picture of the day follow that of the night. He describes it in
[Psa 104:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#019.md) as the calendarial
principal star. מועדים are points and divisions of time (epochs), and
the principal measurer of these for civil and ecclesiastical life is the
moon (cf. Sir. 43:7, ἀπὸ σελήνης σημεῖον ἑορτῆς), just as the sun,
knowing when he is to set, is the infallible measurer of the day. In
[Psa 104:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#020.md) the description, which
throughout is drawn in the presence of God in His honour, passes over
into direct address: jussives (תּשׁת, ויהי) stand in the hypothetical
protasis and in its apodosis (EW. 357, b). It depends upon God's willing
only, and it is night, and the wakeful life of the wild beasts begins to
be astir. The young lions then roar after their prey, and flagitaturi
sunt a Deo cibum suum. The infinitive with Lamed is an elliptical
expression of a conjugatio periphrastica (vid., on [Hab
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017).md), and becomes a varying
expression of the future in general in the later language in
approximation to the Aramaic. The roar of the lions and their going
forth in quest of prey is an asking of God which He Himself has
implanted in their nature. With the rising of the sun the aspect of
things becomes very different. שׁמשׁ is feminine here, where the poet
drops the personification (cf. [Psa
19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001).md). The day which dawns with
sunrise is the time for man. Both as to matter and style, [Psa
104:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021.md) call to mind [Job
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005.md); [Job
37:8](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#008.md); [Job
38:40](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#040.md).

[Psalms 104:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 104:24</span></span>

Fixing his eye upon the sea with its small and great creatures, and the
care of God for all self-living beings, the poet passes over to the
fifth and sixth days of creation. The rich contents of this sixth group
flow over and exceed the decastich. With מה־רבּוּ (not מה־גּדלוּ, [Psa
92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006).md) the poet expresses his wonder at
the great number of God's works, each one at the same time having its
adjustment in accordance with its design, and all, mutually serving one
another, co-operating one with another. קנין, which signifies both
bringing forth and acquiring, has the former meaning here according to
the predicate: full of creatures, which bear in themselves the traces of
the Name of their Creator (קנה). Beside קיניך, however, we also find the
reading קנינך, which is adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer,
represented by the versions (lxx, Vulgate, and Jerome), by expositors
(Rashi: קנין שׁלּך), by the majority of the MSS (according to Norzi) and
old printed copies, which would signify τῆς κτίσεώς σου, or according to
the Latin versions κτήσεώς σου (possessione tua, Luther "they
possessions"), but is inferior to the plural ktisma'toon σου, as an
accusative of the object to מלאה. The sea more particularly is a world
of moving creatures innumerable ([Psa
69:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#035).md). זה היּם does not properly
signify this sea, but that sea, yonder sea (cf. [Psa
68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009.md), [Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013.md); [Jos
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#013).md). The attributes follow in an
appositional relation, the looseness of which admits of the
non-determination (cf. [Psa 68:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028.md);
[Jer 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md); [Gen
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014.md), and the reverse case above in
[Psa 104:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#018)). אניּה ..md) in relation to
אני is a nomen unitatis (the single ship). It is an old word, which is
also Egyptian in the form hani and ana.

(Note: Vide Chabas, Le papyrus magique Harris, p. 246, No. 826: HANI
(אני), vaisseau, navire, and the Book of the Dead 1. 10, where hani
occurs with the determinative picture of a ship. As to the form ana,
vid., Chabas loc. cit. p. 33.)

Leviathan, in the Book of Job, the crocodile, is in this passage the
name of the whale (vid., Lewysohn, Zoologie des Talmuds, 178-180, 505).
Ewald and Hitzig, with the Jewish tradition, understand בּו in [Psa
104:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026.md) according to [Job
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#005.md) : in order to play with him,
which, however, gives no idea that is worthy of God. It may be taken as
an alternative word for שׁם (cf. בּו in [Psa
104:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#020.md), [Job
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#020).md): to play therein, viz., in the
sea (Saadia). In כּלּם, [Psa 104:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027.md),
the range of vision is widened from the creatures of the sea to all the
living things of the earth; cf. the borrowed passages [Psa
145:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015.md)., [Psa
147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md). כּלּם, by an obliteration of
the suffix, signifies directly "altogether," and בּעתּו (cf. [Job
38:32](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#032).md): when it is time for it. With
reference to the change of the subject in the principal and in the
infinitival clause, vid., Ew. 338, a. The existence, passing away, and
origin of all beings is conditioned by God. His hand provides
everything; the turning of His countenance towards them upholds
everything; and His breath, the creative breath, animates and renews all
things. The spirit of life of every creature is the disposing of the
divine Spirit, which hovered over the primordial waters and transformed
the chaos into the cosmos. תּסף in [Psa
104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029.md) is equivalent to תּאסף, as in
[Sa1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md), and frequently. The full
future forms accented on the ultima, from [Psa
104:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027.md) onwards, give emphasis to the
statements. [Job 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014.md). may be
compared with [Psa 104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029.md).

[Psalms 104:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 104:31</span></span>

The poet has now come to an end with the review of the wonders of the
creation, and closes in this seventh group, which is again substantially
decastichic, with a sabbatic meditation, inasmuch as he wishes that the
glory of God, which He has put upon His creatures, and which is
reflected and echoed back by them to Him, may continue for ever, and
that His works may ever be so constituted that He who was satisfied at
the completion of His six days' work may be able to rejoice in them. For
if they cease to give Him pleasure, He can indeed blot them out as He
did at the time of the Flood, since He is always able by a look to put
the earth in a tremble, and by a touch to set the mountains on fire
(ותּרעד of the result of the looking, as in [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md); [Amo
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006.md), and ויעשׁנוּ of that which takes
place simultaneously with the touching, as in [Psa
144:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md), [Zac
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#005.md), cf. on [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010).md). The poet, however, on his part,
will not suffer there to be any lack of the glorifying of Jahve,
inasmuch as he makes it his life's work to praise his God with music and
song (בּחיּי as in [Psa 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005.md), cf. Bar.
4:20, ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις μου). Oh that this his quiet and his audible
meditation upon the honour of God may be pleasing to Him (ערב על
synonymous with טּוב על, but also שׁפר על, [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006).md)! Oh that Jahve may be able to
rejoice in him, as he himself will rejoice in his God! Between "I will
rejoice," [Psa 104:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#034.md), and "He shall
rejoice," [Psa 104:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#031.md), there exists a
reciprocal relation, as between the Sabbath of the creature in God and
the Sabbath of God in the creature. When the Psalmist wishes that God
may have joy in His works of creation, and seeks on his part to please
God and to have his joy in God, he is also warranted in wishing that
those who take pleasure in wickedness, and instead of giving God joy
excite His wrath, may be removed from the earth (יתּמּוּ, cf. [Num
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#035).md); for they are contrary to the
purpose of the good creation of God, they imperil its continuance, and
mar the joy of His creatures. The expression is not: may sins (חטּאים,
as it is meant to be read in B. Berachoth, 10a, and as some editions,
e.g., Bomberg's of 1521, actually have it), but: may sinners, be no
more, for there is no other existence of sin than the personal one.

With the words Bless, O my soul, Jahve, the Psalm recurs to its
introduction, and to this call upon himself is appended the Hallelujah
which summons all creatures to the praise of God - a call of devotion
which occurs nowhere out of the Psalter, and within the Psalter is found
here for the first time, and consequently was only coined in the alter
age. In modern printed copies it is sometimes written הללוּ־יהּ,
sometimes הללוּ יהּ, but in the earlier copies (e.g., Venice 1521,
Wittenberg 1566) mostly as one word הללוּיהּ.

(Note: More accurately הללוּיהּ with Chateph, as Jekuthil ha-Nakdan
expressly demands. Moreover the mode of writing it as one word is the
rule, since the Masora notes the הללוּ־יהּ, occurring only once, in [Psa
135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003.md), with לית בטעם as being the only
instance of the kind.)

In the majority of MSS it is also found thus as one word,

(Note: Yet even in the Talmud (J. Megilla i. 9, Sofrim v. 10) it is a
matter of controversy concerning the mode of writing this word, whether
it is to be separate or combined; and in B. Pesachim 117a Rab appeals to
a Psalter of the school of Chabibi (תילי דבי חביבי) that he has seen, in
which הללו stood in one line and יה in the other. In the same place Rab
Chasda appeals to a תילי דבי רב חנין that he has seen, in which the
Hallelujah standing between two Psalms, which might be regarded as the
close of the Psalm preceding it or as the beginning of the Psalm
following it, as written in the middle between the two (בעמצע פירקא). In
the הלליה written as one word, יה is not regarded as strictly the divine
name, only as an addition strengthening the notion of the הללו, as in
במרחביה [Psa 118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md); with reference to
this, vide Geiger, Urschrift, S. 275.)

and that always with הּ, except the first הללוּיהּ which occurs here at
the end of Ps 104, which has ה raphe in good MSS and old printed copies.
This mode of writing is that attested by the Masora (vid., Baer's
Psalterium, p. 132). The Talmud and Midrash observe this first
Hallelujah is connected in a significant manner with the prospect of the
final overthrow of the wicked. Ben-Pazzi (B. Berachoth 10a) counts 103
פרשׁיות up to this Hallelujah, reckoning [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) and [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md) as one פרשׁת'.
