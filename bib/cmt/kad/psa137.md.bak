By the Rivers of Babylon

The Hallelujah Ps 135 and the Hodu Ps 136 are followed by a Psalm which
glances back into the time of the Exile, when such cheerful songs as
they once sang to the accompaniment of the music of the Levites at the
worship of God on Mount Zion were obliged to be silent. It is anonymous.
The inscription Τῷ Δαυίδ (διὰ) Ἱιερεμίου found in codices of the lxx,
which is meant to say that it is a Davidic song coming from the heart of
Jeremiah,

(Note: Reversely Ellies du Pin (in the preface of his Bibliotque des
Auteurs Ecclsiastiques) says: Le Pseaume 136 porte le nom de David et de
Jeremie, ce qu'il faut apparement entendre ainsi: Pseaume de Jeremie
fait l'imitation de David.)

is all the more erroneous as Jeremiah never was one of the Babylonian
exiles.

The שׁ, which is repeated three times in [Psa
136:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#008.md)., corresponds to the time of the
composition of the Psalm which is required by its contents. It is just
the same with the paragogic i in the future in [Psa
136:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#006.md). But in other respects the
language is classic; and the rhythm, at the beginning softly elegiac,
then more and more excited, and abounding in guttural and sibilant
sounds, is so expressive that scarcely any Psalm is so easily impressed
on the memory as this, which is so pictorial even in sound.

The metre resembles the elegiac as it appears in the so-called caesura
schema of the Lamentations and in the cadence of [Isa
16:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md), which is like the Sapphic
strophe. Every second lien corresponds to the pentameter of the elegiac
metre.

[Psalms 137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 137:1</span></span>

Beginning with perfects, the Psalm has the appearance of being a Psalm
not belonging to the Exile, but written in memory of the Exile. The bank
of a river, like the seashore, is a favourite place of sojourn of those
whom deep grief drives forth from the bustle of men into solitude. The
boundary line of the river gives to solitude a safe back; the monotonous
splashing of the waves keeps up the dull, melancholy alternation of
thoughts and feelings; and at the same time the sight of the cool, fresh
water exercises a soothing influence upon the consuming fever within the
heart. The rivers of Babylon are here those of the Babylonian empire:
not merely the Euphrates with its canals, and the Tigris, but also the
Chaboras (Chebar) and Eulaeos ('Ulai), on whose lonesome banks Ezekiel
([Eze 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003).md) and Daniel (ch. [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002).md) beheld divine visions. The שׁם is
important: there, in a strange land, as captives under the dominion of
the power of the world. And גּם is purposely chosen instead of ו: with
the sitting down in the solitude of the river's banks weeping
immediately came on; when the natural scenery around contrasted so
strongly with that of their native land, the remembrance of Zion only
forced itself upon them all the more powerfully, and the pain at the
isolation from their home would have all the freer course where no
hostilely observant eyes were present to suppress it. The willow (צפצפה)
and viburnum, those trees which are associated with flowing water in hot
low-lying districts, are indigenous in the richly watered lowlands of
Babylonia. ערב (ערבה), if one and the same with Arab. grb, is not the
willow, least of all the weeping-willow, which is called ṣafsâf mustahı̂
in Arabic, "the bending-down willow," but the viburnum with dentate
leaves, described by Wetzstein on [Isa
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004.md). The Talmud even distinguishes
between tsaph-tsapha and ‛araba, but without our being able to obtain
any sure botanic picture from it. The ערבה, whose branches belong to the
constituents of the lulab of the Feast of Tabernacles ([Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040).md), is understood of the
crack-willow \[Salix fragilis\], and even in the passage before us is
surely not distinguished with such botanical precision but that the
gharab and willow together with the weeping-willow (Salix Babylonica)
might be comprehended under the word ערבה. On these trees of the country
abounding in streams the exiles hung their citherns. The time to take
delight in music was past, for μουσικὰ ἐν πένθει ἄκαιρος διήγησις, Sir.
22:6. Joyous songs, as the word שׁיר designates them, were ill suited to
their situation.

In order to understand the כּי in [Psa
137:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#003.md), [Psa
137:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#003.md) and [Psa
137:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#004.md) must be taken together. They
hung up their citherns; for though their lords called upon them to sing
in order that they might divert themselves with their national songs,
they did not feel themselves in the mind for singing songs as they once
resounded at the divine services of their native land. The lxx, Targum,
and Syriac take תּוללינוּ as a synonym of שׁובינוּ, synonymous with
שׁוללינוּ, and so, in fact, that it signifies not, like שׁולל, the
spoiled and captive one, but the spoiler and he who takes other
prisoners. But there is no Aramaic תּלל = שׁלל. It might more readily be
referred back to a Poel תּולל (= התל), to disappoint, deride (Hitzig);
but the usage of the language does not favour this, and a stronger
meaning for the word would be welcome. Either תּולל = תּהולל, like
מהולל, [Psa 102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md), signifies the
raving one, i.e., a bloodthirsty man or a tyrant, or from ילל, ejulare,
one who causes the cry of woe or a tormentor, - a signification which
commends itself in view of the words תּושׁב and תּלמיד, which are
likewise formed with the preformative ת. According to the sense the word
ranks itself with an Hiph. הוליל, like תּועלת, תּוכחה, with הועיל and
הוכיח, in a mainly abstract signification (Dietrich, Abhandlungen, S.
160f.). The דּברי beside שׁיר is used as in [Psa
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020.md); [Psa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004.md); [Psa
105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027.md); [Psa
145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005.md), viz., partitively, dividing up
the genitival notion of the species: words of songs as being parts or
fragments of the national treasury of song, similar to משּׁיר a little
further on, on which Rosenmller correctly says: sacrum aliquod carmen ex
veteribus illis suis Sionicis. With the expression "song of Zion"
alternates in [Psa 137:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#004.md) "song of
Jahve," which, as in [Ch2 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#027.md), cf.
[Ch1 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#007.md), denotes sacred or
liturgical songs, that is to say, songs belonging to Psalm poesy
(including the Cantica).

Before [Psa 137:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#004.md) we have to imagine
that they answered the request of the Babylonians at that time in the
language that follows, or thought thus within themselves when they
withdrew themselves from them. The meaning of the interrogatory
exclamation is not that the singing of sacred songs in a foreign land
(חוצה לארץ) is contrary to the law, for the Psalms continued to be sung
even during the Exile, and were also enriched by new ones. But the shir
had an end during the Exile, in so far as that it was obliged to retire
from publicity into the quiet of the family worship and of the houses of
prayer, in order that that which is holy might not be profaned; and
since it was not, as at home, accompanied by the trumpets of the priests
and the music of the Levites, it became more recitative than singing
properly so called, and therefore could not afford any idea of the
singing of their native land in connection with the worship of God on
Zion. From the striking contrast between the present and the former
times the people of the Exile had in fact to come to the knowledge of
their sins, in order that they might get back by the way of penitence
and earnest longing to that which they had lost Penitence and
home-sickness were at that time inseparable; for all those in whom the
remembrance of Zion was lost gave themselves over to heathenism and were
excluded from the redemption. The poet, translated into the situation of
the exiles, and arming himself against the temptation to apostasy and
the danger of denying God, therefore says: If I forget thee, O
Jerusalem, ימיני תּשׁכּח. תּשׁכּח has been taken as an address to Jahve:
obliviscaris dexterae meae (e.g., Wolfgang Dachstein in his song "An
Wasserflssen Babylon"), but it is far from natural that Jerusalem and
Jahve should be addressed in one clause. Others take ימיני as the
subject and תּשׁכּח transitively: obliviscatur dextera mea, scil. artem
psallendi (Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, Pagninus, Grotius, Hengstenberg, and
others); but this ellipsis is arbitrary, and the interpolation of מנּי
after ימיני (von Ortenberg, following Olshausen) produces an inelegant
cadence. Others again assign a passive sense to תשׁכח: oblivioni detur
(lxx, Italic, Vulgate, and Luther), or a half-passive sense, in
oblivione sit (Jerome); but the thought: let my right hand be forgotten,
is awkward and tame. Obliviscatur me (Syriac, Saadia, and the Psalterium
Romanum) comes nearer to the true meaning. תּשׁכּח is to be taken
reflexively: obliviscatur sui ipsius, let it forget itself, or its
service (Amyraldus, Schultens, Ewald, and Hitzig), which is equivalent
to let it refuse or fail, become lame, become benumbed, much the same as
we say of the arms of legs that they "go to sleep," and just as the
Arabic nasiya signifies both to forget and to become lame (cf. Gesenius,
Thesaurus, p. 921b). La Harpe correctly renders: O Jerusalem! si je
t'oublie jamais, que ma main oublie aussi le mouvement! Thus there is a
correspondence between [Psa 137:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#005.md) and
[Psa 137:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#006.md) : My tongue shall cleave to
my palate if I do not remember thee, if I do not raise Jerusalem above
the sum of my joy. אזכּרכי has the affixed Chirek, with which these
later Psalms are so fond of adorning themselves. ראשׁ is apparently used
as in [Psa 119:160](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#160.md) : supra summam (the
totality) laetitiae meae, as Coccejus explains, h.e. supra omnem
laetitiam meam. But why not then more simply על כּל, above the totality?
ראשׁ here signifies not κεφάλαιον, but κεφαλή: if I do not place
Jerusalem upon the summit of my joy, i.e., my highest joy; therefore, if
I do not cause Jerusalem to be my very highest joy. His spiritual joy
over the city of God is to soar above all earthly joys.

[Psalms 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 137:7</span></span>

The second part of the Psalm supplicates vengeance upon Edom and
Babylon. We see from Obadiah's prophecy, which is taken up again by
Jeremiah, how shamefully the Edomites, that brother-people related by
descent to Israel and yet pre-eminently hostile to it, behaved in
connection with the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans as their
malignant, rapacious, and inhuman helpers. The repeated imper. Piel
ערוּ, from ערה (not imper. Kal from ערר, which would be ערוּ), ought to
have been accented on the ult.; it is, however, in both cases accented
on the first syllable, the pausal ערוּ (cf. כּלוּ in [Psa
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md), and also הסּוּ, [Neh
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#011).md) giving rise to the same
accentuation of the other (in order that two tone-syllables might not
come together). The Pasek also stands between the two repeated words in
order that they may be duly separated, and secures, moreover, to the
guttural initial of the second ערוּ its distinct pronunciation (cf. [Gen
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#028.md); [Num
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016).md). It is to be construed: lay
bare, lay bare (as in [Hab 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013.md), cf.
גּלּה in [Mic 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006).md) in it (Beth of the
place), of in respect of it (Beth of the object), even to the
foundation, i.e., raze it even to the ground, leave not one stone upon
another. From the false brethren the imprecation turns to Babylon, the
city of the imperial power of the world. The daughter, i.e., the
population, of Babylon is addressed as השּׁדוּדה. It certainly seems the
most natural to take this epithet as a designation of its doings which
cry for vengeance. But it cannot in any case be translated: thou
plunderer (Syriac like the Targum: bozuzto; Symmachus ἡ λῃστρίς), for
שׁדד does not mean to rob and plunder, but to offer violence and to
devastate. Therefore: thou devastator; but the word so pointed as we
have it before us cannot have this signification: it ought to be
השּׁדודה, like בּגודה in [Jer 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#007.md),
[Jer 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010.md), or השּׁדוּדה (with an
unchangeable ā), corresponding to the Syriac active intensive form
ālûṣo, oppressor, gōdûfo, slanderer, and the Arabic likewise active
intensive form Arab. fâ‛ûl, e.g., fâshûs, a boaster, and also as an
adjective: ǵôz fâshûs, empty nuts, cf. יקוּשׁ = יקושׁ, a fowler, like
nâṭûr (נאטור), a field-watcher. The form as it stands is part. pass.,
and signifies προνενομευμένη (Aquila), vastata (Jerome). It is possible
that this may be said in the sense of vastanda, although in this sense
of a part. fut. pass. the participles of the Niphal (e.g., Ps 22:32;
[Psa 102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019).md) and of the Pual ([Psa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004).md) are more commonly used. It
cannot at any rate signify vastata in an historical sense, with
reference to the destruction of Babylon by Darius Hystaspes
(Hengstenberg); for [Psa 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md) only
prays that the retribution may come: it cannot therefore as yet have
been executed; but if השׁדודה signified the already devastated one, it
must (at least in the main) have been executed already. It might be more
readily understood as a prophetical representation of the executed
judgment of devastation; but this prophetic rendering coincides with the
imprecative: the imagination of the Semite when he utters a curse sees
the future as a realized fact. "Didst thou see the smitten one
(maḍrûb)," i.e., he whom God must smite? Thus the Arab inquires for a
person who is detested. "Pursue him who is seized (ilḥaḳ el̇ma'chûdh),"
i.e., him whom God must allow thee to seize! Thy speak thus inasmuch as
the imagination at once anticipates the seizure at the same time with
the pursuit. Just as here both maḍrûb and ma'chûdh are participles of
Kasl, so therefore השּׁדוּודה may also have the sense of vastanda (which
must be laid waste!). That which is then further desired for Babylon is
the requital of that which it has done to Israel, [Isa
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006.md). It is the same penal destiny,
comprehending the children also, which is predicted against it in [Isa
13:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016.md), as that which was to be
executed by the Medes. The young children (with reference to עולל, עולל,
vid., on [Psa 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003).md) are to be dashed to
pieces in order that a new generation may not raise up again the
world-wide dominion that has been overthrown, [Isa
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#021.md). It is zeal for God that puts
such harsh words into the mouth of the poet. "That which is Israel's
excellency and special good fortune the believing Israelite desires to
have bestowed upon the whole world, but for this very reason he desires
to see the hostility of the present world of nations against the church
of God broken" (Hofmann). On the other hand, it cannot be denied that
the "blessed" of this Psalm is not suited to the mouth of the New
Testament church. In the Old Testament the church as yet had the form of
a nation, and the longing for the revelation of divine righteousness
clothed itself accordingly in a warlike garb.
