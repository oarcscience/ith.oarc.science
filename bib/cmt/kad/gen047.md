### [Genesis Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 47:1</span></span>

When Joseph had announced to Pharaoh the arrival of his relations in
Goshen, he presented five out of the whole number of his brethren (אחיו
מקצה; on קצה see [Gen 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#004).md) to the
king.

[Genesis 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 47:3</span></span>

Pharaoh asked them about their occupation, and according to Joseph's
instructions they replied that they were herdsmen (צאן רעה, the singular
of the predicate, see Ges. 147c), who had come to sojourn in the land
(גּוּר, i.e., to stay for a time), because the pasture for their flocks
had failed in the land of Canaan on account of the famine. The king then
empowered Joseph to give his father and his brethren a dwelling (הושׁיב)
in the best part of the land, in the land of Goshen, and, if he knew any
brave men among them, to make them rulers over the royal herds, which
were kept, as we may infer, in the land of Goshen, as being the best
pasture-land.

[Genesis 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 47:7</span></span>

Joseph then presented his father to Pharaoh, but not till after the
audience of his brothers had been followed by the royal permission to
settle, for which the old man, who was bowed down with age, was not in a
condition to sue. The patriarch saluted the king with a blessing, and
replied to his inquiry as to his age, "The days of the years of my
pilgrimage are 130 years; few and sorrowful are the days of my life's
years, and have not reached (the perfect in the presentiment of his
approaching end) the days of the life's years of my fathers in the days
of their pilgrimage." Jacob called his own life and that of his fathers
a pilgrimage (מגוּרים), because they had not come into actual possession
of the promised land, but had been obliged all their life long to wander
about, unsettled and homeless, in the land promised to them for an
inheritance, as in a strange land. This pilgrimage was at the same time
a figurative representation of the inconstancy and weariness of the
earthly life, in which man does not attain to that true rest of peace
with God and blessedness in His fellowship, for which he was created,
and for which therefore his soul is continually longing (cf. [Psa
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013.md); [Psa
119:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#019.md), [Psa
119:54](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#054.md); [Ch1
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015).md). The apostle, therefore, could
justly regard these words as a declaration of the longing of the
patriarchs for the eternal rest of their heavenly fatherland ([Heb
11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013).md). So also Jacob's life was
little (מעט) and evil (i.e., full of toil and trouble) in comparison
with the life of his fathers. For Abraham lived to be 175 years old, and
Isaac 180; and neither of them had led a life so agitated, so full of
distress and dangers, of tribulation and anguish, as Jacob had from his
first flight to Haran up to the time of his removal to Egypt.

[Genesis 47:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 47:10</span></span>

After this probably short interview, of which, however, only the leading
incidents are given, Jacob left the king with a blessing.

[Genesis 47:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 47:11</span></span>

Joseph assigned to his father and his brethren, according to Pharaoh's
command, a possession (אחזּה) for a dwelling-place in the best part of
Egypt, the land of Ramses, and provided them with bread, "according to
the mouth of the little ones," i.e., according to the necessities of
each family, answering to the larger or smaller number of their
children. כּלכּל with a double accusative (Ges. 139). The settlement of
the Israelites is called the land of Ramses (רעמסס, in pause רעמסס [Exo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011).md), instead of Goshen, either
because the province of Goshen (Γεσέμ, lxx) is indicated by the name of
its former capital Ramses (i.e., Heroopolis, on the site or in the
immediate neighbourhood of the modern Abu Keisheib, in Wady Tumilat
(vid., [Exo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011).md), or because Israel
settled in the vicinity of Ramses. The district of Goshen is to be
sought in the modern province of el Sharkiyeh (i.e., the eastern), on
the east side of the Nile, towards Arabia, still the most fertile and
productive province of Egypt (cf. Robinson, Pal. i. 78, 79). For Goshen
was bounded on the east by the desert of Arabia Petraea, which stretches
away to Philistia ([Exo 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017.md), cf.
[Ch1 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021).md) and is called Γεσέμ Ἀραβίας
in the Septuagint in consequence ([Gen
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#010.md); [Gen
46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034).md), and must have extended
westwards to the Nile, since the Israelites had an abundance of fish
([Num 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#005).md). It probably skirted the
Tanitic arm of the Nile, as the fields of Zoan, i.e., Tanis, are said to
have been the scene of the mighty acts of God in Egypt ([Psa
78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012.md), [Psa
78:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#043.md), cf. [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022).md). In this province Joseph
assigned his relations settlements near to himself ([Gen
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#010).md), from which they could quickly
and easily communicate with one another ([Gen
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#028.md); [Gen
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001)..md). Whether he lived at Ramses or
not, cannot be determined, just because the residence of the Pharaoh of
that time is not known, and the notion that it was at Memphis is only
based upon utterly uncertain combinations relating to the Hyksos.

[Genesis 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 47:13</span></span>

To make the extent of the benefit conferred by Joseph upon his family,
in providing them with the necessary supplies during the years of
famine, all the more apparent, a description is given of the distress
into which the inhabitants of Egypt and Canaan were plunged by the
continuance of the famine.

[Gen 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#013.md)

The land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted with hunger. -
ותּלהּ: from להה = לאה, to languish, to be exhausted, only occurring
again in [Pro 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#018.md), Hithp. in a
secondary sense.

[Gen 47:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#014.md)

All the money in both countries was paid in to Joseph for the purchase
of corn, and deposited by him in Pharaoh's house, i.e., the royal
treasury.

[Gen 47:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#015.md)

When the money was exhausted, the Egyptians all came to Joseph with the
petition: "Give us bread, why should we die before thee" (i.e., so that
thou shouldst see us die, when in reality thou canst support us)? Joseph
then offered to accept their cattle in payment; and they brought him
near their herds, in return for which he provided them that year with
bread. נהל: Piel to lead, with the secondary meaning, to care for ([Psa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002.md); [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011), etc..md); hence the signification
here, "to maintain."

[Gen 47:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#018.md)

When that year had passed (תּתּם, as in [Psa
102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md), to denote the termination of
the year), they came again "the second year" (i.e., after the money was
gone, not the second of the seven years of famine) and said: "We cannot
hide it from my lord (אדוני, a title similar to your majesty), but the
money is all gone, and the cattle have come to my lord; we have nothing
left to offer to my lord but our bodies and our land." אם כּי is an
intensified כּי following a negation ("but," as in [Gen
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#029), etc..md), and is to be understood
elliptically; lit., "for if," sc., we would speak openly; not "that
because," for the causal signification of אם is not established. תּם
with אל is constructio praegnans: "completed to my lord," i.e.,
completely handed over to my lord. לפני נשׁאר is the same: "left before
my lord," i.e., for us to lay before, or offer to my lord. "Why should
we die before thine eyes, we and our land! Buy us and our land for
bread, that we may be, we and our land, servants (subject) to Pharaoh;
and give seed, that we may live and not die, and the land become not
desolate." In the first clause נמוּת is transferred per zeugma to the
land; in the last, the word תּשׁם is used to describe the destruction of
the land. The form תּשׁם is the same as תּקל in [Gen
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#004.md).

[Gen 47:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#020.md)

Thus Joseph secured the possession of the whole land to Pharaoh by
purchase, and "the people he removed to cities, from one end of the land
of Egypt to the other." לערים, not from one city to another, but
"according to (= κατά) the cities;" so that he distributed the
population of the whole land according to the cities in which the corn
was housed, placing them partly in the cities themselves, and partly in
the immediate neighbourhood.

[Gen 47:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#022.md)

The lands of the priests Joseph did not buy, "for the priests had an
allowance from Pharaoh, and ate their allowance, which Pharaoh gave
them; therefore they sold not their lands." חק a fixed allowance of
food, as in [Pro 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008.md); [Eze
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#027.md). This allowance was granted by
Pharaoh probably only during the years of famine; in any case it was an
arrangement which ceased when the possessions of the priests sufficed
for their need, since, according to Diod. Sic. i. 73, the priests
provided the sacrifices and the support of both themselves and their
servants from the revenue of their lands; and with this Herodotus also
agrees (2, 37).

[Gen 47:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#023.md)

Then Joseph said to the people: "Behold I have bought you this day and
your land for Pharaoh; there have ye (הא only found in [Eze
16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043.md) and [Dan
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#043).md) seed, and sow the land; and of
the produce ye shall give the fifth for Pharaoh, and four parts (ידת, as
in [Gen 43:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034).md) shall belong to you for
seed, and for the support of yourselves, your families and children."
The people agreed to this; and the writer adds ([Gen
47:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#026).md), it became a law, in existence
to this day (his own time), "with regard to the land of Egypt for
Pharaoh with reference to the fifth," i.e., that the fifth of the
produce of the land should be paid to Pharaoh.

Profane writers have given at least an indirect support to the reality
of this political reform of Joseph's. Herodotus, for example (2, 109),
states that king Sesostris divided the land among the Egyptians, giving
every one a square piece of the same size as his hereditary possession
(κλῆρον), and derived his own revenue from a yearly tax upon them. Diod.
Sic. (1, 73), again, says that all the land in Egypt belonged either to
the priests, to the king, or to the warriors; and Strabo (xvii. p. 787),
that the farmers and traders held rateable land, so that the peasants
were not landowners. On the monuments, too, the kings, priests, and
warriors only are represented as having landed property (cf. Wilkinson,
Manners and Customs, i. 263). The biblical account says nothing about
the exemption of the warriors from taxation and their possession of
land, for that was a later arrangement. According to Herod. 2, 168,
every warrior had received from former kings, as an honourable payment,
twelve choice fields (ἄρουραι) free from taxation, but they were taken
away by the Hephaesto-priest Sethos, a contemporary of Hezekiah, when he
ascended the throne (Herod. 2, 141). But when Herodotus and Diodorus
Sic. attribute to Sesostris the division of the land into 36 νομοί, and
the letting of these for a yearly payment; these comparatively recent
accounts simply transfer the arrangement, which was actually made by
Joseph, to a half-mythical king, to whom the later legends ascribed all
the greater deeds and more important measures of the early Pharaohs. And
so far as Joseph's arrangement itself was concerned, not only had he the
good of the people and the interests of the king in view, but the people
themselves accepted it as a favour, inasmuch as in a land where the
produce was regularly thirty-fold, the cession of a fifth could not be
an oppressive burden. And it is probable that Joseph not only turned the
temporary distress to account by raising the king into the position of
sole possessor of the land, with the exception of that of the priests,
and bringing the people into a condition of feudal dependence upon him,
but had also a still more comprehensive object in view; viz., to secure
the population against the danger of starvation in case the crops should
fail at any future time, not only by dividing the arable land in equal
proportions among the people generally, but, as has been conjectured, by
laying the foundation for a system of cultivation regulated by laws and
watched over by the state, and possibly also by commencing a system of
artificial irrigation by means of canals, for the purpose of conveying
the fertilizing water of the Nile as uniformly as possible to all parts
of the land. (An explanation of this system is given by Hengstenberg in
his Dissertations, from the Correspondance d'Orient par Michaud, etc.)
To mention either these or any other plans of a similar kind, did not
come within the scope of the book of Genesis, which restricts itself, in
accordance with its purely religious intention, to a description of the
way in which, during the years of famine, Joseph proved himself to both
the king and people of Egypt to be the true support of the land, so that
in him Israel already became a saviour of the Gentiles. The measures
taken by Joseph are thus circumstantially described, partly because the
relation into which the Egyptians were brought to their visible king
bore a typical resemblance to the relation in which the Israelites were
placed by the Mosaic constitution to Jehovah, their God-King, since they
also had to give a double tenth, i.e., the fifth of the produce of their
lands, and were in reality only farmers of the soil which Jehovah had
given them in Canaan for a possession, so that they could not part with
their hereditary possessions in perpetuity ([Lev
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023).md); and partly also because
Joseph's conduct exhibited in type how God entrusts His servants with
the good things of this earth, in order that they may use them not only
for the preservation of the lives of individuals and nations, but also
for the promotion of the purposes of His kingdom. For, as is stated in
conclusion in [Gen 47:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#027.md), not only did
Joseph preserve the lives of the Egyptians, for which they expressed
their acknowledgements ([Gen 47:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#025).md),
but under his administration the house of Israel was able, without
suffering any privations, or being brought into a relation of dependence
towards Pharaoh, to dwell in the land of Goshen, to establish itself
there (נאחז as in [Gen 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#010).md), and to
become fruitful and multiply.

[Genesis 47:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 47:28</span></span>

Jacob lived in Egypt for 17 years. He then sent for Joseph, as he felt
that his death was approaching; and having requested him, as a mark of
love and faithfulness, not to bury him in Egypt, but near his fathers in
Canaan, he made him assure him on oath (by putting his hand under his
hip, vid., p. 164) that his wishes should be fulfilled. When Joseph had
taken this oath, "Israel bowed (in worship) upon the bed's head." He had
talked with Joseph while sitting upon the bed; and when Joseph had
promised to fulfil his wish, he turned towards the head of the bed, so
as to lie with his face upon the bed, and thus worshipped God, thanking
Him for granting his wish, which sprang from living faith in the
promises of God; just as David also worshipped upon his bed ([Kg1
1:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#047).md). The Vulgate rendering is
correct: adoravit Deum conversus ad lectuli caput. That of the lxx, on
the contrary, is προσεκύνησεν Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄδρον τῆς ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ
(i.e., המּטּה); and the Syriac and Itala have the same (cf. [Heb
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#021).md). But no fitting sense can be
obtained from this rendering, unless we think of the staff with which
Jacob had gone through life, and, taking αὐτου therefore in the sense of
αὑτοῦ, assume that Jacob made use of the staff to enable him to sit
upright in bed, and so prayed, bent upon or over it, though even then
the expression המטה ראשׁ remains a strange one; so that unquestionably
this rendering arose from a false reading of המטה, and is not proved to
be correct by the quotation in [Heb
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#021.md). "Adduxit enim lxx Interpr.
versionem Apostolus, quod ea tum usitata esset, non quod lectionem illam
praeferendam judicaret (Calovii Bibl. illustr. ad h. l.).
