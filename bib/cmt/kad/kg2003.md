### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 3:1</span></span>

Reign of Joram of Israel. - For the chronological statement in [Kg2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001.md), see at [Kg2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#017.md). Joram or Jehoram was not so
ungodly as his father Ahab and his Mother Jezebel. He had the statue or
pillar of Baal, which his father had erected in Samaria, removed; and it
was only to the sin of Jeroboam, i.e., the calf-worship, that he
adhered. Joram therefore wished to abolish the worship of Baal and
elevate the worship of Jehovah, under the image of the calf (ox), into
the region of his kingdom once more. For the singular suffix ממּנּה see
Ewald, 317, a. He did not succeed, however, in exterminating the worship
of Baal. It not only continued in Samaria, but appears to have been
carried on again in the most shameless manner (cf. [Kg2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#018)..md); at which we cannot be
surprised, since his mother Jezebel, that fanatical worshipper of Baal,
was living throughout the whole of his reign ([Kg2
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 3:4</span></span>

War of Joram, in Alliance with Jehoshaphat, against the Moabites. - [Kg2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md), [Kg2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#005.md). The occasion of this war was the
rebellion of the Moabites, i.e., the refusal to pay tribute to Israel
since the death of Ahab. Mesha the (vassal-) king of Moab was a
possessor of flocks, and paid to the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and
100,000 rams; not merely at the commencement of each new reign (Cler.),
but as a yearly tribute (השׁיב, to bring again = to bring repeatedly, as
in [Num 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#009), etc..md). This yearly
tribute could not be exorbitant for the land of the Moabites, which
abounded in good pasture, and was specially adapted for the rearing of
flocks. The payment of tribute in natural objects and in the produce of
the land was very customary in ancient times, and is still usual among
the tribes of Asia.

(Note: Pecunia ipsa a pecore appellabatur. Etiam nunc in tabulis
Censoriis pascua dicuntur omnia, ex quibus populus reditus habet, quia
diu hoc solum vectigal fuit. Mulctatio quoque nonnisi ovium boumque
impendio dicebatur. - Plinii h. nat. xviii. 3.)

נוקד signifies both a shepherd ([Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001).md) and also a possessor of flocks.
In Arabic it is properly the possessor of a superior kind of sheep and
goats (vid., Boch. Hieroz. i. p. 483f. ed. Ros.). צמר may either be
taken as a second object to השׁיב, or be connected with אילים htiw as an
accusative of looser government (Ewald, 287, h.). In the first case the
tribute would consist of the wool (the fleeces) of 100,000 lambs and
100,000 rams; in the second, of 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000
rams. In support of the latter we may quote [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md), where lambs are mentioned as
tribute.

[Kg2 3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#005.md)

The statement concerning the rebellion of the Moabites, which has
already been mentioned in [Kg2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md), is
repeated here, because it furnished the occasion for the expedition
about to be described. Ahaziah had been unable to do anything during his
short reign to renew the subjugation of Moab; Joram was therefore
anxious to overtake what had been neglected immediately after his ascent
of the throne. He went to Samaria ההוּא בּיּום, at that time, namely,
when he renewed his demand for the tribute and it was refused (Thenius),
and mustered all Israel, i.e., raised an army out of the whole kingdom,
and asked Jehoshaphat to join in the war, which he willingly promised to
do (as in [Kg1 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#004).md), notwithstanding
the fact that he had been blamed by prophets for his alliance with Ahab
and Ahaziah ([Ch2 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002.md) and [Ch2
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#037).md). He probably wished to chastise
the Moabites still further on this occasion for their invasion of Judah
(2 Chron 20), and to do his part by bringing them once more under the
yoke of Israel, to put it out of their power to make fresh incursions
into Judah.

[Kg2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#008.md)

In reply to Joram's question, "By which way shall we advance (against
Moab)?" Jehoshaphat decided in favour of "the way through the desert of
Edom." There were two ways by which it was possible to enter the land of
the Moabites; namely, either by going above the Dead Sea, and crossing
the Jordan and the boundary river Arnon, and so entering it from the
north, or by going round the southern point of the Dead Sea, and
advancing through the northern portion of the mountains of Edom, and
thus entering it from the south. The latter way was the longer of the
two, and the one attended with the greatest difficulties and dangers,
because the army would have to cross mountains which were very difficult
to ascend. Nevertheless Jehoshaphat decided in its favour, partly
because, if they took the northern route, they would have the Syrians at
Ramoth in Gilead to fear, partly also because the Moabites, from their
very confidence in the inaccessibility of their southern boundary, would
hardly expect any attack from that side, and might therefore, if
assailed at that point, be taken off their guard and easily defeated,
and probably also from a regard to the king of Edom, whom they could
induce to join them with his troops if they took that route, not so much
perhaps for the purpose of strengthening their own army as to make sure
of his forces, namely, that he would not make a fresh attempt at
rebellion by a second invasion of the kingdom of Judah while Jehoshaphat
was taking the field against the Moabites.

[Kg2 3:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#009.md)

But however cleverly this plan may have been contrived, when the united
army had been marching round for seven days and was passing through the
deep rocky valley of the Ahsy,

(Note: The usual route from southern Judaea to the land of the Moabites,
which even the Crusaders and more recent travellers took, runs round the
Dead Sea up to the mouth of the Wady ed Deraah or Kerak, and then up
this wady to Kerak (vid., Rob. ii. p. 231). The allied kings did not
take this route however, but went through the Wady el Kurahy or
es-Safieh, which opens into the southern end of the Dead Sea, and which
is called the Wady el Ahsy farther up in the mountains, by Seetzen (R.
ii. pp. 355,356) erroneously the Wady el Hssa (Rob. ii. p. 488), a
ravine through which Burckhardt passed with the greatest difficulty
(Syrien, ii. p. 673). That they advanced by this route is a necessary
inference from the fact, that when they first suffered from want of
water they were on the border of the Moabitish territory, of which this
very wady forms the boundary ([Kg2
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#021.md); see Burckh. p. 674, and Rob.
Pal. ii. p. 555), and the water came flowing from Edom ([Kg2
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#020).md). Neither of these circumstances
is applicable to the Wady el Kerak. - Still less can we assume, with O.
v. Gerlach, that they chose the route through the Arabah that they might
approach Moab from the south, as the Israelites under Moses had done.
For it would have been impossible for them to reach the border of Moab
by this circuitous route. And why should they go so far round, with the
way through Edom open to them?)

which divided the territories of Edom and Moab, it was in the greatest
danger of perishing from want of water for men and cattle, as the river
which flows through this valley, and in which they probably hoped to
find a sufficient supply of water, since according to Robinson (Pal. ii.
pp. 476 and 488) it is a stream which never fails, was at that time
perfectly dry.

In this distress the hearts of the two kings were manifested. - [Kg2
3:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#010.md). Joram cried out in his
despair: "Woe, that Jehovah has called these three kings, to give them
into the hand of Moab!" (כּי, that, serves to give emphasis to the
assurance; see Ewald, 330, b.) Jehoshaphat, on the other hand, had
confidence in the Lord, and inquired whether there was no prophet there,
through whom they could seek counsel of the Lord (as in [Kg1
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#007).md); whereupon one of the servants
of the Israelitish king answered that Elisha was there, who had poured
water upon the hands of Elijah, i.e., had been with him daily as his
servant, and therefore could probably obtain and give a revelation from
god. Elisha may perhaps have come to the neighbourhood of the army at
the instigation of the Spirit of God, because the distress of the kings
was to be one means in the hand of the Lord, not only of distinguishing
the prophet in the eyes of Joram, but also of pointing Joram to the Lord
as the only true God. The three kings, humbled by the calamity, went in
person to Elisha, instead of sending for him.

[Kg2 3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#013.md)

In order still further to humble the king of Israel, who was already
bowed down by the trouble, and to produce some salutary fruit of
repentance in his heart, Elisha addressed him in these words: "What have
I to do with thee? Go to the (Baal-) prophets of thy father and thy
mother! Let them help thee." When Joram replied to this in a
supplicatory tone: על, no, pray (as in [Rut
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#013).md), i.e., speak not in this
refusing way, for the Lord has brought these three kings - not me alone,
but Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom also - into this trouble; Elisha
said to him with a solemn oath (cf. [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001).md): "If I did not regard
Jehoshaphat, I should not look at thee and have respect to thee," i.e.,
I should not deign to look at thee, much less to help thee.

[Kg2 3:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#015.md)

He then sent for a minstrel, to collect his mind from the impressions of
the outer world by the soft tones of the instrument, and by subduing the
self-life and life in the external world to become absorbed in the
intuition of divine things. On this influence of music upon the state of
the mind, see the remark on [Sa1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#016.md), and Passavant's Untersuchungen
ber den Lebens-magnetismus, p. 207 (ed. 2). - As the minstrel was
playing, the hand of the Lord came upon him (והיה according to the later
usage for ויהי, as in [Sa1 17:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#048.md),
etc.; compare Ewald, 345, b., and יהוה יד as in [Kg1
18:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#046).md), so that he said in the name of
the Lord: "Make this valley full of trenches (עשׂה, inf. abs. for the
imperative; for גּבים גּבים see Ges. 108, 4); for thus saith the Lord,
ye will see neither wind nor rain, and this valley will be filled with
water, that ye may be able to drink, and your flocks and your cattle."
גּבים are trenches for collecting water (vid., [Jer
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#003).md), which would suddenly flow down
through the brook-valley. This large quantity of water came on the
(following) morning "by the way of Edom" ([Kg2
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#020).md), a heavy fall of rain or violent
storm having taken place, as is evident from the context, in the eastern
mountains of Edom, at a great distance from the Israelitish camp, the
water of which filled the brook-valley, i.e., the Wady el Kurahy and el
Ahsy (see at [Kg2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#009).md) at once,
without the Israelites observing anything either of the wind, which
always precedes rain in the East (Harmar, Beobb. i. pp. 51, 52), or of
the rain itself. מקניכם are the flocks intended for slaughtering,
בּהמתּכם the beasts of burden.

[Kg2 3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#018.md)

Elisha continued: "and this is too little for Jehovah (the comparative
force of נקל is implied in the context, especially in the alternating
combination of the two clauses, which is indicated by ו...ו, see Ewald,
360, c.): He will also give Moab into your hand, and ye will smite all
the fortified and choice cities, fell all the good trees (fruit-trees),
stop up all the springs of water, and spoil all the good fields with
stones." מבצר and מבחור are intended to produce a play upon words,
through the resemblance in their sound and meaning (Ewald, 160, c.). In
the announcement of the devastation of the land there is an allusion to
[Deu 20:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#019.md), according to which the
Israelites were ordered to spare the fruit-trees when Canaan was taken.
These instructions were not to apply to Moab, because the Moabites
themselves as the arch-foes of Israel would not act in any other way
with the land of Israel if they should gain the victory. הכאב, to add
pain, is a poetical expression for spoiling a field or rendering it
infertile through the heaping up of stones.

[Kg2 3:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#020.md)

The water came in the morning at the time of the morning sacrifice (see
[Kg1 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#036).md), to indicate that the Lord
was once more restoring His favour to the people on account of the
sacrifice presented to Him in His temple.

The help of God, which preserved the Israelitish army from destruction,
also prepared destruction for the Moabites. [Kg2
3:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#021.md). On hearing the report of the
march of the allied kings, Moab had raised all the men that were capable
of bearing arms, and stationed them on the frontier. In the morning,
when the sun had risen above the water, the Moabites saw the water
opposite to them like blood, and said: "That is blood: the (allied)
kings have destroyed themselves and smitten one another; and now to the
spoil, Moab!" Coming with this expectation to the Israelitish camp, they
were received by the allies, who were ready for battle, and put to
flight. The divine help consisted, therefore, not in a miracle which
surpassed the laws of nature, but simply in the fact that the Lord God,
as He had predicted through His prophet, caused the forces of nature
ordained by Him to work in the predetermined manner. As the sudden
supply of an abundance of water was caused in a natural way by a heavy
fall of rain, so the illusion, which was so fatal to the Moabites, is
also to be explained in the natural manner indicated in the text. From
the reddish earth of the freshly dug trenches the water collected in
them had acquired a reddish colour, which was considerably intensified
by the rays of the rising sun, so that when seen from a distance it
resembled blood. The Moabites, however, were the less likely to
entertain the thought of an optical delusion, from the fact that with
their accurate acquaintance with the country they knew very well that
there was no water in the wady at that time, and they had neither seen
nor heard anything of the rain which had fallen at a great distance off
in the Edomitish mountains. The thought was therefore a natural one,
that the water was blood, and that the cause of the blood could only
have been that their enemies had massacred one another, more especially
as the jealousy between Israel and Judah was not unknown to them, and
they could have no doubt that Edom had only come with them as a forced
ally after the unsuccessful attempt at rebellion which it had made a
short time before; and, lastly, they cannot quite have forgotten their
own last expedition against Judah in alliance with the Edomites and
Ammonites, which had completely failed, because the men composing their
own army had destroyed one another. But if they came into collision with
the allied army of the Israelites under such a delusion as this, the
battle could only end in defeat and in a general flight so far as they
were concerned.

[Kg2 3:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#024.md)

The Israelites followed the fugitives into their own land and laid it
waste, as Elisha had prophesied ([Kg2
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025.md) compared with [Kg2
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#019).md). The Chethb ויבו־בהּ is to be
read בהּ ויּבו (for ויּבוא as in [Kg1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#012)): and (Israel.md) came into the
land and smote Moab. The Keri ויּכּוּ is a bad emendation. הכּות is
either the infinitive construct used instead of the infin. absolute
(Ewald, 351, c.), or an unusual form of the inf. absol. (Ewald, 240,
b.). עד־השׁאיר, till one (= so that one only) left its stones in
Kir-chareseth. On the infinitive form השׁאיר see at [Jos
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#022.md). The suffix in אבניה probably
points forward to the following noun (Ewald, 309, c.). The city called
חרשׂת קיר here and [Isa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md), and חרשׂ
קיר in [Isa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011.md) and [Jer
48:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#031.md), [Jer
48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md), i.e., probably city of
potsherds, is called elsewhere מואב קיר, the citadel of Moab ([Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001).md), as the principal fortress of
the land (in the Chaldee Vers. דמואב כרכּא), and still exists under the
name of Kerak, with a strong castle build by the Crusaders, upon a lofty
and steep chalk rock, surrounded by a deep and narrow valley, which runs
westward under the name of Wady Kerak and falls into the Dead Sea (vid.,
Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 643ff., C. v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 271,272). This
fortress the allied kings besieged. "The slingers surrounded and smote
it," i.e., bombarded it.

[Kg2 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#026.md)

When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too strong for him, he
attempted to fight a way through the besiegers with 700 men with drawn
swords (להבקיע, lit., to split them) to the king of Edom, i.e., on the
side which was held by this king, from whom he probably hoped that he
should meet with the weakest resistance.

[Kg2 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027.md)

But when this attempt failed, in his desperation he took his first-born
son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice upon
the wall, i.e., in the sight of the besiegers, not to the God of Israel
(Joseph. Ephr. Syr., etc.), but to his own god Camos (see at [Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007).md), to procure help from him by
appeasing his wrath; just as the heathen constantly sought to appease
the wrath of their gods by human sacrifices on the occasion of great
calamities (vid., Euseb. praepar. ev. iv. 16, and E. v. Lasaulx, die
Shnopfer der Griechen und Rmer, pp. 8ff.). - "And there was (came) great
wrath upon Israel, and they departed from him (the king of Moab) and
returned into their land." As על קצף היה is used of the divine wrath or
judgment, which a man brings upon himself by sinning, in every other
case in which the phrase occurs, we cannot understand it here as
signifying the "human indignation," or ill-will, which broke out among
the besieged (Budd., Schulz, and others). The meaning is: this act of
abomination, to which the king of the Moabites had been impelled by the
extremity of his distress, brought a severe judgment from God upon
Israel. The besiegers, that is to say, felt the wrath of God, which they
had brought upon themselves by occasioning human sacrifice, which is
strictly forbidden in the law ([Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md); [Lev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#003).md), either inwardly in their
conscience or in some outwardly visible signs, so that they gave up the
further prosecution of the siege and the conquest of the city, without
having attained the object of the expedition, namely, to renew the
subjugation of Moab under the power of Israel.
