Renewal and Completion of the Covenant of Grace - Zechariah 8

In this chapter we have the second half of the Lord's answer to the
question concerning the last-days, which promises to the people the
restitution of the former relation of grace, and the future
glorification of Israel, on the simple condition of their observing the
moral precepts of the law. This double promise is contained in two words
of God, each of which is divided into a number of separate sayings,
containing the separate details of the salvation bestowed by the formula
כּה אמר יי צ (thus saith Jehovah of hosts): the first into seven ([Zac
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#002.md), [Zac
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#003.md), [Zac
8:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#004.md), [Zac
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006.md), [Zac
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007.md), [Zac
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#009.md), [Zac
8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#014).md), the second into three ([Zac
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019.md), [Zac
8:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020.md), and [Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023).md). Jerome observes, with reference
to this: "By the separate words and sentences, in which Israel is
promised not only prosperity, but things almost incredible in their
magnitude, the prophet declares, 'Thus saith the Almighty God;' saying,
in other words, Do not imagine that the things which I promise are my
own, and so disbelieve me as only a man; they are the promises of God
which I unfold."

[Zechariah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 8:1</span></span>

Restoration and completion of the covenant relation. - [Zac
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#001.md). "And the word of Jehovah of hosts
came, saying, [Zac 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#002.md). Thus saith
Jehovah of hosts, I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and with
great fury I am jealous for her." The promise commences with the
declaration of the Lord, that He has resolved to give active expression
once more to the warmth of His love to Zion. The perfects are used
prophetically of that which God had resolved to do, and was now about to
accomplish. For the fact itself, compare [Zac
1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014.md). This warmth of the love of
God towards Zion, and of His wrath towards the nations that were hostile
to Zion, will manifest itself in the facts described in [Zac
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#003.md) : "Thus saith Jehovah, I return to
Zion, and shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be
called city of truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts the holy
mountain." When Jerusalem was given up into the power of its foes, the
Lord had forsaken His dwelling-place in the temple. Ezekiel saw the
glory of the Lord depart from the temple (Ezeliel [Eze
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003.md); [Eze
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004.md), [Eze
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018.md); [Eze
11:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#022).md). Now He is about to resume
His abode in Jerusalem once more. The difference between this promise
and the similar promise in [Zac
2:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010.md), is not that in the latter
passage Jehovah's dwelling in the midst of His people is to be
understood in an ideal and absolute sense, whereas here it simply
denotes such a dwelling as had taken place before, as Koehler supposes.
This is not implied in שׁבתּי, nor is it in harmony with the statement
that Jerusalem is to be called a city of truth, and the temple hill the
holy mountain. ‛Ir 'ĕmeth does not mean "city of security," but city of
truth or fidelity, i.e., in which truth and fidelity towards the Lord
have their home. The temple mountain will be called the holy mountain,
i.e., will be so, and will be recognised and known as being so, from the
fact that Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, will sanctify it by His
dwelling there. Jerusalem did not acquire this character in the period
after the captivity, in which, though not defiled by gross idolatry, as
in the times before the captivity, it was polluted by other moral
abominations no less than it had been before. Jerusalem becomes a
faithful city for the first time through the Messiah, and it is through
Him that the temple mountain first really becomes the holy mountain. The
opinion, that there is nothing in the promises in [Zac
8:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#003.md) that did not really happen to
Israel in the period from Zerubbabel to Christ (Kliefoth, Koehler,
etc.), is proved to be incorrect by the very words, both of this verse
and also of [Zac 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006.md), [Zac
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007.md), [Zac
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#008.md), which follow. How could the
simple restoration of the previous covenant relation be described in
[Zac 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006.md) as something that appeared
miraculous and incredible to the nation? There is only so much
correctness in the view in question, that the promise does not refer
exclusively to the Messianic times, but that feeble commencements of its
fulfilment accompanied the completion of the work of building the
temple, and the restoration of Jerusalem by Nehemiah. But the saying
which follows proves that these commencements do not exhaust the meaning
of the words.

[Zechariah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 8:4</span></span>

[Zac 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#004.md). "Thus saith Jehovah of
hosts, Yet will there sit old men and women in the streets of Jerusalem,
every one with his staff in his hand, for the multitude of the days of
his life. [Zac 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#005.md). And the streets of
the city will be full of boys and girls playing in their streets." Long
life, to an extreme old age, and a plentiful number of blooming
children, were theocratic blessings, which the Lord had already promised
in the law to His people, so far as they were faithful to the covenant.
Consequently there does not appear to be any Messianic element in this
promise. But if we compare this fourth verse with [Isa
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020.md), we shall see that extreme old
age also belonged to the blessings of the Messianic times. And as Israel
had almost always to suffer most grievously from wars and other
calamities, which swept off the people at an untimely age, during the
time which extended from Zerubbabel to Christ; it must be admitted,
notwithstanding the description of the prosperous times which Israel
enjoyed under the government of Simon (1 Maccabees 14:4-15), that this
promise also was only fulfilled in a very meagre measure, so far as
Jerusalem was concerned, before the coming of Christ.

[Zechariah 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 8:6</span></span>

"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, If it be marvellous in the eyes of the
remnant of this nation in those days, will it also be marvellous in my
eyes? is the saying of Jehovah of hosts." The second clause of this
verse is to be taken as a question with a negative answer, גּם for הגם,
as in [Sa1 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#007.md), and the meaning is
the following: If this (what is promised in [Zac
8:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#003).md) should appear marvellous, i.e.,
incredible, to the people in those days when it shall arrive, it will
not on that account appear marvellous to Jehovah Himself, i.e., Jehovah
will for all that cause what has been promised actually to occur. This
contains an assurance not only of the greatness of the salvation set
before them, but also of the certainty of its realization. "The remnant
of the nation," as in [Hag 1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012.md).

[Zechariah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 8:7</span></span>

[Zac 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007.md). "Thus saith Jehovah of
hosts, Behold, I save my people out of the land of the rising and out of
the land of the setting of the sun. [Zac
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#008.md). And I bring them hither, and they
will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and will be my people, and I shall
be their God, in truth and righteousness." The deliverance of the people
of God out of the heathen lands did indeed commence with the return of a
body of exiles from Babylon under the guidance of Zerubbabel, but their
deliverance out of all the countries of the earth is still in the
future. Instead of all countries, the land of the rising (the east) and
the land of the setting (the west) are individualized (cf. [Psa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md); [Psa
113:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#003.md); [Isa
59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md); [Mal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011).md). This deliverance is first
effected through the Messiah. This is indisputably evident from the
words, "I bring them to Jerusalem," by which of course we cannot
understand the earthly Jerusalem, since that would not furnish space
enough for the Jews scattered throughout all the world, but the open and
enlarged Jerusalem mentioned in [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008.md), i.e., the Messianic kingdom of
God. Then will those who have been gathered together out of all the
countries of the earth become in truth God's nation. Israel was the
nation of Jehovah, and Jehovah was also Israel's God from the time of
the establishment of the old covenant at Sinai (Exodus 24). This
relation is to be restored in the future, "in truth and righteousness."
This is the new feature by which the future is to be distinguished from
the present and the past. The words "in truth and righteousness" belong
to the two clauses, "they shall be" and "I will be." For the fact
itself, compare [Hos 2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#021.md); and for
the expression, [Isa 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md) and [Kg1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006.md).

[Zechariah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 8:9</span></span>

After these promises the prophet admonishes the people to be of good
courage, because the Lord will from henceforth bestow His blessing upon
them. [Zac 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#009.md). "Thus saith Jehovah of
hosts, Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words
from the mouth of the prophets, on the day that the foundation of the
house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, the temple, that it may be built.
[Zac 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010.md). For before those days there
were no wages for the men, and no wages of cattle; and whoever went out
and in had no peace because of the oppressor: and I drove all men, one
against the other. [Zac 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#011.md). But now
I am not as in the former days to the remnant of this people, is the
saying of Jehovah of hosts. [Zac 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#012.md).
But the seed of peace, the vine, shall yield its fruit, and the land
shall yield its produce, and the heaven give its dew; and to the remnant
of this people will I give all this for an inheritance." Having the
hands strong, is the same as taking good courage for any enterprise
(thus in [Jdg 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#011.md); [Sa2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#007.md), and [Eze
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#014).md). This phrase does not refer
specially to their courageous continuation of the building of the
temple, but has the more general meaning of taking courage to accomplish
what the calling of each required, as [Zac
8:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010.md) show. The persons addressed
are those who hear the words of the prophets in these days. This
suggests a motive for taking courage. Because they hear these words,
they are to look forward with comfort to the future, and do what their
calling requires. The words of the prophets are the promises which
Zechariah announced in [Zac 8:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#002.md), and
his contemporary Haggai in ch. 2. It will not do to take the plural
נביאים in a general sense, as referring to Zechariah alone. For if there
had been no prophet at that time beside Zechariah, he could not have
spoken in general terms of prophets. By the defining phrase, who are or
who rose up at the time when the foundation of the temple was laid,
these prophets are distinguished from the earlier ones before the
captivity ([Zac 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007.md), [Zac
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012.md); [Zac
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#004).md), and their words are thereby
limited to what Haggai and Zechariah prophesied from that time
downwards. בּיום does not stand for מיּום (Hitzig), but yōm is used in
the general sense of the time at which anything does occur or has
occurred. As a more precise definition of יום יסּד the word להבּנות is
added, to show that the time referred to is that in which the laying of
the foundation of the temple in the time of Cyrus became an eventful
fact through the continuation of the building. In [Zac
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010.md). a reason is assigned for the
admonition to work with good courage, by an exhibition of the contrast
between the present and the former times. Before those days, sc. when
the building of the temple was resumed and continued, a man received no
wages for his work, and even the cattle received none, namely, because
the labour of man and beast, i.e., agricultural pursuits, yielded no
result, or at any rate a most meagre result, by no means corresponding
to the labour (cf. [Hag 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md), [Hag
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md); [Hag
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016.md), [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019).md). The feminine suffix attached to
איננּה refers with inexactness to the nearest word הבּהמה, instead of
the more remote שׂכר (cf. Ewald, 317, c). In addition to this, on going
out and coming in, i.e., when pursuing their ordinary avocations, men
came everywhere upon enemies or adversaries, and therefore there was an
entire absence of civil peace. הצּר is not an abstract noun,
"oppression" (lxx, Chald., Vulg.), but a concrete, "adversary,"
oppressor, though not the heathen foe merely, but, as the last clause of
[Zac 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010.md) shows, the adversaries in
their own nation also. In ואשׁלּח the ו is not a simple copula, but the
ו consec. with the compensation wanting, like wa'agaareesh in [Jdg
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#009) (cf. Ewald, 232, h.md); and שׁלּח, to
send, used of a hostile nation, is here transferred to personal attacks
on the part of individuals.

[Zechariah 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 8:11</span></span>

But now the Lord will act differently to His remaining people, and bless
it again with a fruitful harvest of the fruits of the field and soil.
כּי in [Zac 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#012.md), "for," after a
negative clause, "but." זרע השּׁלום, not the seed will be secure
(Chald., Pesh.), but the seed of peace, viz., the vine. This is so
designated, not because there is a berâkhâh in the grape ([Isa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008).md); but because the vine can only
flourish in peaceful times, and not when the land is laid waste by
enemies (Koehler). On the words which follow, compare [Lev
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004.md)., [Psa
67:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#007.md); [Hag
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#010.md); [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md). "Future abundance will
compensate for the drought and scarcity of the past" (Jerome).

[Zechariah 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 8:13</span></span>

The whole blessing is finally summed up in one expression in [Zac
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013.md) : "And it will come to pass, as
ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel,
so will I endow you with salvation, that ye may be a blessing. Fear not,
let your hands be strong." The formula, to be a curse among the nations,
is to be interpreted according to [Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md); [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md); [Jer
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018.md); [Kg2
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#019.md), as equivalent to being the
object of a curse, i.e., so smitten by God as to serve as the object of
curses. In harmony with this, the phrase to "become a blessing" is
equivalent to being so blessed as to be used as a benedictory formula
(cf. [Gen 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022.md); [Jer
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022).md). This promise is made to the
remnant of Judah and Israel, and therefore of all the twelve tribes, who
are to become partakers of the future salvation in undivided unity (cf.
[Zac 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010.md), [Zac
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013.md); [Zac
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006.md); [Zac
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#014).md). Israel is therefore to look
forward to the future without alarm.

[Zechariah 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 8:14</span></span>

The ground upon which this promise rests is given in [Zac
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#014.md) and [Zac
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#015.md), and it is closed in [Zac
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016.md) and [Zac
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#017.md) by the addition of the condition
upon which it is to be fulfilled. [Zac
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#014.md). "For thus saith Jehovah of
hosts: As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers were angry with
me, saith Jehovah of hosts, and repented not; [Zac
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#015.md). So have I purposed again in
these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Fear ye
not. [Zac 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016.md). These are the words
that ye are to do: speak truth every one to his neighbour; truth and
judgment of peace judge ye in your gates. [Zac
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#017.md). And let not one devise the evil
of his neighbour, and love not the oath of deceit: for all this, I hate
it, is the saying of Jehovah." As the time of punishment by exile came
upon Israel through the decree of God, so is it now a decree of the Lord
to show good to Judah. In שׁבתּי זממתּי the שׁבתּי takes the place of
the adverbial idea "again." The people have therefore no need to fear,
if they are only diligent in practising truth, righteousness, and love
to their neighbour. God required the same of the fathers ([Zac
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009).md). Mishpat shâlōm is such an
administration of justice as tends to promote peace and establish
concord between those who are at strife. "In your gates," where courts
of justice were held (cf. [Deu 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#019.md);
[Deu 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#015), etc..md). The את before
כּל־אלּה in [Zac 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#017.md) may be accounted
for from a kind of attraction, inasmuch as by the insertion of אשׁר the
object "all this" is separated from the verb, to bring it out with
emphasis: "As for all this, it is what I hate." Compare the similar use
of 'ēth in [Hag 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005.md), and Ewald, 277,
d.

[Zechariah 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zac 8:18</span></span>

The last word of God gives, in connection with what precedes, the direct
answer to the inquiry concerning the fast-days, and consists of three
sayings, [Zac 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019.md), [Zac
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020.md), and [Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023.md), of which the second and third
explain the contents of the first more clearly. [Zac
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#018.md) is the same as [Zac
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#001.md) and [Zac
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007.md) and [Zac
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#008.md). [Zac
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019.md). "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts:
The fasting of the fourth, and the fasting of the fifth, and the fasting
of the seventh, and the fasting of the tenth (months), will become
pleasure and joy to the house of Judah, and good feasts. But truth and
peace ye should love." On the fast-days mentioned, compare the
exposition of [Zac 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003.md). These
fast-days the Lord will turn into days of joy and cheerful feast-days -
namely, by bestowing upon them such a fulness of salvation, that Judah
will forget to commemorate the former mournful events, and will only
have occasion to rejoice in the blessings of grace bestowed upon it by
God; though only when the condition mentioned in [Zac
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016.md) and [Zac
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#017.md) has been fulfilled.

(Note: Luther aptly observes: "Keep only what I command, and let fasting
alone. Yea, if ye keep my commandments, not only shall such fasts be
over and come to an end; but because I will do so much good to
Jerusalem, all the affliction, for which ye have chosen and kept such
fasting, shall be so forgotten, that ye will be transported with joy
when ye think of your fasting, and of the heart's grief on account of
which ye fasted for the time," etc.)

[Zechariah 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">zac 8:20</span></span>

[Zac 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020.md). "Thus saith Jehovah of
hosts: Yet will nations come, and inhabitants of many cities. [Zac
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021.md). And the inhabitants of one
(city) will go to another, and say, 'We will go, go away, to supplicate
the face of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of hosts.' 'I will also go.'
[Zac 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#022.md). And many peoples and strong
nations will come, to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to
supplicate the face of Jehovah." These verses do not announce a further
or second glorification, which God has designed for His people, but
simply indicate the nature and magnitude of the salvation appointed for
Israel, through which its fast-days will be turned into days of joy.
Hitherto Israel had kept days of mourning and fasting on account of the
destruction of Jerusalem and the temple; but in the future the Lord will
so glorify His city and His house, that not only will Israel keep joyful
feasts there, but many and strong heathen nations will go to the house
of God, to seek and worship the God of hosts. עד is used with emphasis,
so that it resembles a sentence: "It will still come to pass, that,"
etc. This is how אשׁר in [Zac 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021.md) and
[Zac 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023.md) is to be taken, and not as
the introduction to the saying preceded energetically by עד, for which
Hitzig is wrong in referring to [Mic
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md). For the fact itself, compare
[Mic 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)., [Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md)., [Jer
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019.md). In [Zac
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021.md) the thought is individualized.
The inhabitants of one city call upon those of another. נלכה הלוך, "we
will go to supplicate," etc.; and the population of the other city
responds to the summons by saying, "I also will go." חלּות את־פּני, as
in [Zac 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002.md).

[Zechariah 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023.md)

"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days ten men out of all languages
of the nations take hold; they will take hold of the skirt of a Jewish
man, saying, We will go with you; for we have heard God is with you."
Not only will the heathen then flow to Jerusalem to seek the God of
Israel, but they will crowd together to Israel and Judah to be received
into fellowship with them as a nation. Ten men from the heathen nations
to one Jewish man: so great will be the pressure of the heathen. Ten is
used as an indefinite number, denoting a great and complete multitude,
as in [Gen 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#007.md); [Lev
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md); [Num
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022.md), and [Sa1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#008.md). For the figure, compare [Isa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md). והחזיקוּ is a resumption of
יחזיקוּ in the form of an apodosis. The unusual combination כּל לשׁנות
הגּוים, "all the tongues of the nations," is formed after [Isa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018.md) (הגּוים והלּשׁנות, "all nations
and tongues," i.e., nations of all languages), and on the basis of [Gen
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#020.md) and [Gen
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#031.md). For נלכה עמּכם, compare [Rut
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#016.md); and for אלהים עמּכם, [Ch2
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009.md).

The promise, that the Lord would change the fast-days in the future into
days of rejoicing and cheerful feasts, if Israel only loved truth and
peace ([Zac 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020).md), when taken in
connection with what is said in [Zac
7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005.md) concerning fasting, left the
decision of the question, whether the fast-days were to be given up or
to be still observed, in the hands of the people. We have no historical
information as to the course adopted by the inhabitants of Judah in
consequence of the divine answer. All that we know is, that even to the
present day the Jews observe the four disastrous days as days of
national mourning. The talmudic tradition in Rosh-hashana (f. 18, a, b),
that the four fast-days were abolished in consequence of the answer of
Jehovah, and were not restored again till after the destruction of the
second temple, is not only very improbable, but is no doubt erroneous,
inasmuch as, although the restoration of the days for commemorating the
destruction of Jerusalem and the burning of the temple could easily be
explained, on the supposition that the second destruction occurred at
the same time as the first, it is not so easy to explain the restoration
of the fast-days in commemoration of events for which there was no link
of connection whatever in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. In
all probability, the matter stands rather thus: that after the receipt
of this verbal answer, the people did not venture formally to abolish
the fast-days before the appearance of the promised salvation, but let
them remain, even if they were not always strictly observed; and that at
a later period the Jews, who rejected the Messiah, began again to
observe them with greater stringency after the second destruction of
Jerusalem, and continue to do so to the present time, not because "the
prophecy of the glory intended for Israel ([Zac
8:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#018).md) is still unfulfilled"
(Koehler), but because "blindness in part is happened to Israel," so
that it has not discerned the fulfilment, which commenced with the
appearance of Christ upon earth.
