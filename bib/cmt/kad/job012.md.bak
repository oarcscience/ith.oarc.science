### [Job Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#001.md)

[Job 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 12:1</span></span>

1 The Job began, and said:

2 Truly then ye are the people,

And wisdom shall die with you!

3 I also have a heart as well as you;

I do not stand behind you;

And to whom should not such things be known?

The admission, which is strengthened by כּי אמנם, truly then (distinct
from אמנם כּי, for truly, [Job 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#004.md),
similar to כּי הנּה, behold indeed, [Psa
128:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#004).md), is intended as irony: ye are
not merely single individuals, but the people = race of men (עם, as [Isa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007.md); [Isa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005).md), so that all human understanding
is confined to you, and there is none other to be found; and when once
you die, it will seem to have died out. The lxx correctly renders: μὴ
ὑμεῖς ἐστὲ ἄνθρωποι μόνοι (according to the reading of the Cod. Alex.);
he also has a heart like them, he is therefore not empty, נבוב, [Job
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012.md). Heart is, like [Job
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md), comp. נלבב, [Job
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012.md), equivalent to νοῦς διάνοια;
Ewald's translation, "I also have a head even as you" ("brains" would
better accord with the connection), is a western form of expression, and
modern and unbiblical (vid., Division "Herz und Haupt," Psychol. iv.
12). He is not second to them; מן נפל, like [Job
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#002.md), properly to slip from, to be
below any one; מן is not the comparative (Ewald). Oetinger's translation
is not bad: I cannot slink away at your presence. Who has not a
knowledge of such things as those which they, by setting themselves up
as defenders of God, have presented to him! אתּי היה is equivalent to
ידעתּי, σύνοιδα, [Isa 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012.md).

[Job 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 12:4</span></span>

4 I must be a mockery to my own friend,

I who called on Eloah and He heard me;

A mockery - the just, the godly man.

5 Contempt belongs to misfortune, according to the ideas of the
prosperous;

It awaits those who are ready to slip.

6 Tents of the destroyer remain in peace,

And those that defy God are prosperous,

Who taketh Eloah into his hand.

The synallage of לרעהוּ for לרעי is not nearly so difficult as many
others: a laughing-stock to his own friend; comp. [Isa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#008.md), they worship the work of their
(his) own hands (ידיו). "One who called on Eloah (לאלוהּ, for which
לאלוהּ is found in lxx at [Job 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#002).md)
and He heard him" is in apposition to the subject; likewise תמים צדיק,
which is to be explained according to [Pro
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005.md), צדיק (from צדק, Arab. ṣdq, to be
hard, firm, stiff, straight), is one who in his conduct rules himself
strictly according to the will of God; תמים, one whose thoughts are in
all respects and without disguise what they should be-in one word: pure.
Most old translators (Targ., Vulg., Luther) give לפּיד the
signification, a torch. Thus e.g., Levi v. Gerson explains: "According
to the view of the prosperous and carnally secure, he who is ready for
falterings of the feet, i.e., likely to fall, is like a lighted torch
which burns away and destroys whatever comes in contact with it, and
therefore one keeps aloof from him; but it is also more than this: he is
an object of contempt in their eyes." Job might not inappropriately say,
that in the eyes of the prosperous he is like a despised, cast-away
torch (comp. the similar figure, [Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019.md), like a branch that is rejected
with contempt); and [Job 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#005.md) would be
suitably connected with this if למועדי could be derived from a
substantive מעד, vacillatio, but neither the usage of the language nor
the scriptio plena (after which Jerome translates tempus statutum, and
consequently has in mind the מועדים, times of festal pilgrimages, which
are also called ררלים in later times), nor the vowel pointing (instead
of which מעדי would be expected), is favourable to this. רגל מועדי
signifies vacillantes pede, those whose prosperity is shaken, and who
are in danger of destruction that is near at hand. We therefore, like
Abenezra and modern expositors, who are here happily agreed, take לפיד
as composed of ל and פּיד, a word common to the books of Job ([Job
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024.md); [Job
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#029).md) and Proverbs (ch. [Pro
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#022).md), which is compared by the
Jewish lexicographers, according both to form and meaning, to כּיד ([Job
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#020).md) and איד, and perhaps signifies
originally dissolution (comp. פדה), decease (Syr. f'jodo, escape; Arab.
faid, dying), fall, then generally calamity, misfortune: contempt
(befits) misfortune, according to the thoughts (or thinking), idea of
the prosperous. The pointing wavers between לעשׁתּות and the more
authorized לעשׁתּוּת, with which Parchon compares the nouns עבדוּת and
מרדּוּת; the ת, like ד in the latter word, has Dag. lene, since the
punctuation is in this respect not quite consistent, or follows laws at
present unknown (comp. Ges. 21, rem. 2). [Job
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#005.md) is now suitably connected: ready
(with reference to בוז) for those who stumble, i.e., contempt certainly
awaits such, it is ready and waiting for them, נכון, ἕτοιμος, like [Exo
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#002.md).

While the unfortunate, in spite of his innocence, has thus only to
expect contempt, the tents, i.e., dwellings and possessions, of the
oppressor and the marauder remain in prosperity; ישׁליוּ for ישׁלוּ, an
intensive form used not only in pause ([Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md); comp. [Deu
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037).md) and with greater distinctives
([Num 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#006.md); [Psa
122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006).md), but also in passages where it
receives no such accent ([Psa 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md);
[Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md); [Psa
73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002).md). On אהלים, instead of אהלים,
vid., Ges. 93, 6, 3. The verbal clause ([Job
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006).md) is followed by a substantival
clause ([Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006).md). בּטּחות is an
abstract plural from בּטּוּח, perfectly secure; therefore: the most
care-less security is the portion of those who provoke God (lxx
περοργίζουσι);

(Note: Luther takes בטחות as the adverb to מרגיזי: und toben wider Gott
thrstiglich (vid., Vilmar, Pastoraltheolog. Bltter, 1861, S. 110-112);
according to the Vulg., et audacter provocant Deum.)

and this is continued in an individualizing form: him who causes Eloah
to go into his hand. Seb. Schmid explains this passage in the main
correctly: qui Deum in manu fert h.e. qui manum aut potentiam suam pro
Deo habet et licitum sibi putat quodlibet; comp. [Hab
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011.md) : "this his strength becomes God
to him," i.e., he deifies his own power, and puts it in the place of
God. But הביא signifies, in this connection with לידו (not בידו),
neither to carry, nor to lead (Gesenius, who compares [Psa
74:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005.md), where, however, it signifies to
cause to go into = to strike into); it must be translated: he who causes
Eloah to enter into his hand; from which translation it is clear that
not the deification of the hand, but of that which is taken into the
hand, is meant. This which is taken into the hand is not, however, an
idol (Abenezra), but the sword; therefore: him who thinks after the
manner of Lamech,

(Note: \[Comp Pentateuch, at [Gen
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025.md), Clark's Foreign Theological
Library. - Tr.\])

as he takes the iron weapon of attack and defence into his hand, that he
needs no other God.

[Job 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 12:7</span></span>

7 But ask now even the beasts - they shall teach it thee;

And the birds of heaven - they shall declare it to thee:

8 Or look thoughtfully to the ground - it shall teach it thee;

And the fish of the sea shall tell it thee.

9 Who would not recognise in all this

That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this,

10 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,

And the breath of all mankind?!

The meaning of the whole strophe is perverted if זאת ([Job
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009).md), is, with Ewald, referred to
"the destiny of severe suffering and pain," and if that which precedes
is accordingly referred to the testimony of creation to God as its
author. Since, as a glance at what follows shows, Job further on praises
God as the governor of the universe, it may be expected that the
reference is here to God as the creator and preserver of the world,
which seems to be the meaning of the words. Job himself expresses the
purpose of this hymn of confession, [Job
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#002.md)., [Job
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001.md).: he will show the friends that
the majesty of God, before which he ought, according to their demands,
to humble himself in penitence, is not less known to him than to them;
and with ואולם, verum enim vero, he passes over to this subject when he
begins his third answer with the following thought: The perception in
which you pride yourselves I also possess; true, I am an object of
scornful contempt to you, who are as little able to understand the
suffering of the godly as the prosperity of the godless, nevertheless
what you know I also know: ask now, etc. Bildad had appealed to the
sayings of the ancients, which have the long experience of the past in
their favour, to support the justice of the divine government; Job here
appeals to the absoluteness of the divine rule over creation. In form,
this strophe is the counterpart of [Job
8:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008.md) in the speech of Bildad, and
somewhat also of [Job 11:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md) in that
of Zophar. The working of God, which infinitely transcends human power
and knowledge, is the sermon which is continuously preached by all
created things; they all proclaim the omnipotence and wisdom of the
Creator.

The plural בּהמות is followed by the verb that refers to it, in the
singular, in favour of which [Gen
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022.md) is the favourite example among
old expositors (Ges. 146, 3). On the other hand, the verb might follow
the collective עוף in the plural, according to Ges. 146, 1. The plural,
however, is used only in [Job 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#008.md),
because there the verb precedes instead of following its subject.
According to the rule Ges. 128, 2, the jussive form of the fut. follows
the imperative. In the midst of this enumeration of created things,
שׂיח, as a substantive, seems to signify the plants - and especially as
Arab. šı̂h even now, in the neighbourhood of Job's ancient habitation, is
the name of a well-known mountain-plant - under whose shade a meagre
vegetation is preserved even in the hot season (vid., on [Job
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#004).). But (1.md) שׂיח as subst. is gen.
masc. [Gen 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005)); (2.md) instead of לערץ,
in order to describe a plant that is found on the ground, or one rooted
in the ground, it must be על־הארץ or בארץ; (3) the mention of plants
between the birds and fishes would be strange. It may therefore be taken
as the imperative: speak to the earth (lxx, Targ., Vulg., and most
others); or, which I prefer, since the Aramaic construction לו סח,
narravit ei, does not occur elsewhere in Hebrew (although perhaps
implicite, [Pro 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#022.md), תשׂיחך = לך
תשׂיח, favulabitur, or confabulabitur tibi), as a pregnant expression:
think, i.e., look meditatively to the earth (Ewald), since שׂוּח (שׂיח),
like הגה, combines the significations of quiet or articulate meditation
on a subject. The exhortation directs attention not to the earth in
itself, but to the small living things which move about on the ground,
comprehended in the collective name רמשׂ, syn. שׁרץ (creeping things),
in the record of creation. All these creatures, though without reason
and speech, still utter a language which is heard by every intelligent
man. Renan, after Ewald, translates erroneously: qui ne sait parmi tous
ces tres. They do not even possess knowledge, but they offer
instruction, and are a means of knowledge; בּ with ידע, like [Gen
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008.md); [Gen
42:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#033.md), and freq. All the creatures
named declare that the hand of Jehovah has made "this," whatever we see
around us, τὸ βλεπόμενον, [Heb 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003.md).
In the same manner in [Isa 66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md); [Jer
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022.md), כּל־אלּה is used of the world
around us. In the hand of God, i.e., in His power, because His
workmanship, are the souls of all living things, and the spirit (that
which came direct from God) of all men; every order of life, high and
low, owes its origin and continuance to Him. אישׁ is the individual, and
in this connection, in which נפשׁ and רוּח (= נשׁמה) are certainly not
unintentionally thus separated, the individual man. Creation is the
school of knowledge, and man is the learner. And this knowledge forces
itself upon one's attention: quis non cognoverit? The perf. has this
subjunctive force also elsewhere in interrogative clauses, e.g., [Psa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003.md) (vid., on [Gen
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007).md). That the name of God, JEHOVAH,
for once escapes the poet here, is to be explained from the phrase "the
hand of Jehovah hath made this," being a somewhat proverbial expression
(comp. [Isa 41:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#020.md); [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002).md).

Job now refers to the sayings of the fathers, the authority of which, as
being handed down from past generations, Bildad had maintained in his
opposition to Job.

[Job 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 12:11</span></span>

11 Shall not the ear try sayings,

As the palate tasteth food?

12 Among the ancients is wisdom,

And long life is understanding.

13 With Him is wisdom and strength;

Counsel and understanding are His.

The meaning of [Job 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011.md) is, that the
sayings (מלּין, [Job 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#010.md), comp. [Job
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#027).md) of the ancients are not to be
accepted without being proved; the waw in וחך is waw adaequationis, as
[Job 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007.md); [Job
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012.md), therefore equivalent to
quemadmodum; it places together for comparison things that are
analogous: The ear, which is used here like αἰθητήριον ([Heb
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014).md), has the task of searching out
and testing weighty sayings, as the palate by tasting has to find out
delicious and suitable food; this is indicated by לו, the dat. commodi.
So far Job recognises the authority of these traditional sayings. At any
rate, he adds ([Job 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012).md): wisdom is
to be expected from the hoary-headed, and length of life is
understanding, i.e., it accompanies length of life. "Length of days" may
thus be taken as the subject (Ewald, Olsh.); but בּ may also, with the
old translations and expositors, be carried forward from the preceding
clause: ἐν δὲ πολλῷ βίῳ ἐπιστήμη (lxx). We prefer, as the most natural:
long life is a school of understanding. But - such is the antithesis in
[Job 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#013.md) which belongs to this
strophe - the highest possessor of wisdom, as of might, is God. Ewald
inserts two self-made couplets before [Job
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012.md), which in his opinion are
required both by the connection and "the structure of the strophe;" we
see as little need for this interpolation here as before, [Job
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014.md). עמּו and לו, which are placed
first for the sake of emphasis, manifestly introduce an antithesis; and
it is evident from the antithesis, that the One who is placed in
contrast to the many men of experience is God. Wisdom is found among the
ancients, although their sayings are not to be always implicitly
accepted; but wisdom belongs to God as an attribute of His nature, and
indeed absolutely, i.e., on every side, and without measure, as the
piling up of synonymous expressions implies: חכמה, which perceives the
reason of the nature, and the reality of the existence, of things; עצה,
which is never perplexed as to the best way of attaining its purpose;
תּבוּנה, which can penetrate to the bottom of what is true and false,
sound and corrupt (comp. [Kg1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009).md);
and also גּבוּרה, which is able to carry out the plans, purposes, and
decisions of this wisdom against all hindrance and opposition.

In the strophe which follows, from his own observation and from
traditional knowledge ([Job 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001).md), Job
describes the working of God, as the unsearchably wise and the
irresistibly mighty One, both among men and in nature.

[Job 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 12:14</span></span>

14 Behold, He breaketh down and it cannot be built again,

He shutteth up, and it cannot be opened.

15 Behold, He restraineth the waters and they dry up,

And He letteth them out and they overturn the earth.

16 With Him is might and existence,

The erring and the deceiver are His.

God is almighty, and everything in opposition to Him powerless. If He
break down (any structure whatever), it can never be rebuilt; should He
close upon any one (i.e., the dungeon, as perhaps a cistern covered with
a stone, [Lam 3:53](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#053.md), comp. [Jer
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006.md); על with reference to the depth
of the dungeon, instead of the usual בּעד), it (that which is closed
from above) cannot be opened again. In like manner, when He desires to
punish a land, He disposes the elements according to His will and
pleasure, by bringing upon it drought or flood. יעצר, coercet, according
to the correct Masoretic mode of writing יעצר with dagesh in the Ssade,
in order clearly to distinguish in the pronunciation between the forms
j'a-ssor and jaa'ssor (יעצר);

(Note: Vid., my notice of Br's Psalter-Ausgabe, Luth. Zeitschr. 1863, 3;
and comp. Keil on [Lev 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md) (Comm on
Pent., Clark's transl.).)

ויבשׁוּ (for which Abulwalid writes ויבשׁוּ) is a defective form of
writing according to Ges. 69, 3, 3; the form ויהפכוּ with the similarly
pointed fut. consec., [Sa1 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#012.md), form
a pair (zuwg) noted by the Masora. By תּוּשׁיּה, which is ascribed to
God, is here to be understood that which really exists, the real, the
objective, knowledge resting on an objective actual basis, in contrast
with what only appears to be; so that consequently the idea of [Job
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#016.md) and [Job
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#013.md) is somewhat veiled; for the
primary notion of חכמה is thickness, solidity, purity, like πυκνότης.

(Note: The primary notion of חכם, Arab. hkm, is, to be thick, firm,
solid, as the prim. notion of Arab. sachfa (to be foolish, silly) is to
be thin, loose, not holding together (as a bad texture). The same
fundamental notions are represented in the expression of moral qualities
(in distinction from intellectual) by צדק, Arab. sdq, and רשׁע, (Arab.
rs', rsg).)

This strophe closes like the preceding, which favours our division. The
line with עמּו is followed by one with לו, which affirms that, in the
supremacy of His rule and the wisdom of His counsels, God makes evil in
every form subservient to His designs.

[Job 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 12:17</span></span>

17 He leadeth away counsellors stripped of their robes,

And maketh judges fools.

18 The authority of kings He looseth,

And bindeth their loins with bands.

19 He leadeth away priests stripped of their robes,

And overthroweth those who are firmly established.

20 He removeth the speech of the eloquent,

And taketh away the judgment of the aged.

21 He poureth contempt upon princes,

And maketh loose the girdle of the mighty.

In [Job 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#017.md), [Job
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#019.md), שׁולל is added to מוליך as a
conditional accusative; the old expositors vary in the rendering of this
word; at any rate it does not mean: chained (Targ. on [Job
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#017)), from שׁלל (שׁרר.md), which is
reduplicated in the word שׁלשׁלת, a chain, a word used in later Hebrew
than the language of the Old Testament (שׁרשׁרה is the Old Testament
word); nor is it: taken as booty, made captive (lxx αἰχμαλώτους; Targ.
on [Job 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#019.md), בּבזתא, in the quality
of spoil) = משׁולל; but it is a neuter adjective closely allied to the
idea of the verb, exutus, not however mente (deprived of sense), but
vestibus; not merely barefooted (Hirz., Oehler, with lxx, [Mic
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008), ἀνυπόδετος.md), which is the meaning
of יחף, but: stripped of their clothes with violence (vid., [Isa
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004).md), stripped in particular of the
insignia of their power. He leads them half-naked into captivity, and
takes away the judges as fools (יהולל, vid., Psychol. S. 292), by
destroying not only their power, but the prestige of their position
also. We find echoes of this utterance respecting God's paradoxical rule
in the world in [Isa 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#023.md); [Isa
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#025.md); and Isaiah's oracle on Egypt,
[Job 19:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#011.md), furnishes an
illustration in the reality.

It is but too natural to translate [Job
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#018.md) : the bands of kings He looses
(after [Psa 116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016.md), למוסרי פתחת, Thou
hast loosed my bands); but the relation of the two parts of the verse
can then not be this: He unchains and chains kings (Hirz., Ew.,
Heiligst. Schlottm.), for the fut. consec. ויּאסר requires a contrast
that is intimately connected with the context, and not of mere outward
form: fetters in which kings have bound others (מלכים, gen. subjectivus)
He looses, and binds them in fetters (Raschi), - an explanation which
much commends itself, if מוּסר could only be justified as the construct
of מוּסר by the remark that "the o sinks into u" (Ewald, 213, c). מוּסר
does not once occur in the signification vinculum; but only the plur.
מוסרים and מוסרות, vincula, accord with the usage of the language, so
that even the pointing מוסר proposed by Hirzel is a venture. מוּסר,
however, as constr. of מוּסר, correction, discipline, rule (i.e., as the
domination of punishment, from יסר, castigare), is an equally suitable
sense, and is probably connected by the poet with פּתּח (a word very
familiar to him, [Job 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#011.md); [Job
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005.md); [Job
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#006).md) on account of its relation both
in sound and sense to מוסרים (comp. [Psa
105:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#022).md). The English translation is
correct: He looseth the authority of kings. The antithesis is certainly
lost, but the thoughts here moreover flow on in synonymous parallelism.

[Job 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#019.md)

It is unnecessary to understand כהנים, after [Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018.md), of high officers of state,
perhaps privy councillors; such priest-princes as Melchizedek of Salem
and Jethro of Midian are meant. איטנים, which denotes inexhaustible,
perennis, when used of waters, is descriptive of nations as invincible
in might, [Jer 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015.md), and of persons as
firmly-rooted and stedfast. נאמנים, such as are tested, who are able to
speak and counsel what is right at the fitting season, consequently the
ready in speech and counsel. The derivation, proposed by Kimchi, from
נאם, in the sense of diserti, would require the pointing נאמנים. טעם is
taste, judgment, tact, which knows what is right and appropriate under
the different circumstances of life, [Sa1
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#033.md). יקּח is used exactly as in [Hos
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md). [Job
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#021.md) is repeated verbatim, [Psa
107:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040.md); the trilogy, Ps 105-107,
particularly Ps 107, is full of passages similar to the second part of
Isaiah and the book of Job (vid., Psalter, ii. 117). אפיקים (only here
and [Job 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#007).md) are the strong, from
אפק, to hold together, especially to concentrate strength on anything.
מזיח (only here, instead of מזח, not from מזח, which is an imaginary
root, but from זחח, according to Frst equivalent to זקק, to lace, bind)
is the girdle with which the garments were fastened and girded up for
any great exertion, especially for desperate conflict ([Isa
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027).md). To make him weak or relaxed, is
the same as to deprive of the ability of vigorous, powerful action.
Every word is here appropriately used. This tottering relaxed condition
is the very opposite of the intensity and energy which belongs to "the
strong." All temporal and spiritual power is subject to God: He gives or
takes it away according to His supreme will and pleasure.

[Job 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 12:22</span></span>

22 He discovereth deep things out of darkness,

And bringeth out to light the shadow of death;

23 He giveth prosperity to nations and then destroyeth them,

Increase of territory to nations and then carrieth them away;

24 He taketh away the understanding of the chief people of the land,

And maketh them to wander in a trackless wilderness;

25 They grope in darkness without light,

He maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.

The meaning of [Job 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#022.md) in this
connection can only be, that there is nothing so finely spun out that
God cannot make it visible. All secret plans of the wicked, all secret
sins, and the deeds of the evil-doer though veiled in deep darkness, He
bringeth before the tribunal of the world. The form of writing given by
the Masora is עמוּקות with koph raphatum, consequently plur. from עמוּק,
like ערוּמים, עצוּמים from ערוּם, עצוּם, not from עמק.

(Note: Kimchi in his Wrterbuch adopts the form עמקּות, but gives
Abulwalid as an authority for the lengthened form, which, according to
the Masora on [Lev 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#003.md), [Lev
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#025.md), is the traditional. The two
exceptions where the form occurs with a long vowel are [Pro
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#027) and this passage..md)

The lxx translates משגיא πλανῶν, as it is also explained in several
Midrash-passages, but only by a few Jewish expositors (Jachja, Alschech)
by מטעה. The word, however, is not משׁגּיא, but משׂגּיא with ש
sinistrum, after which in Midrash Esther it is explained by מגדיל; and
Hirzel correctly interprets it of upward growth (Jerome after the Targ.
unsuitably, multiplicat), and שׁטח, on the other hand, of growth in
extent. The latter word is falsely explained by the Targ. in the sense
of expandere rete, and Abenezra also falsely explains: He scatters
nations, and brings them to their original peace. The verb שׁטח is here
connected with ל, as הפתּה ([Gen
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027).md); both signify to make a wider
and longer space for any one, used here of the ground where they dwell
and rule. The opposite, in an unpropitious sense, is הנחה, which is used
here, as [Kg2 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011.md), in a similar
sense with הגלה (abducere, i.e., in servitutem). We have intentionally
translated גוים nations, עם people; for גּוי, as we shall show
elsewhere, is the mass held together by the ties of a common origin,
language, and country; (עם) עם, the people bound together by unity of
government, whose membra praecipua are consequently called העם ראשׁי.
הארץ is, in this connection, the country, although elsewhere, as [Isa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004.md), comp. [Job
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005.md), הארץ עם signifies also the
people of the earth or mankind; for the Hebrew language expresses a
country as a portion of the earth, and the earth as a whole, by the same
name. Job dwells longer on this tragic picture, how God makes the star
of the prosperity of these chiefs to set in mad and blind
self-destruction, according to the proverb, quem Deus perdere vult prius
dementat. This description seems to be echoed in many points in Isaiah,
especially in the oracle on Egypt, Job 19 (e.g., כּשּׁכּור, [Job
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#014).md). The connection ברך לא בתהו is
not genitival; but דרך לא is either an adverbial clause appended to the
verb, as חקר לא, [Job 34:24](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024.md), בנים לא,
[Ch1 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#030.md), [Ch1
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#032.md), or, which we prefer as being
more natural, and on account of the position of the words, a virtual
adjective: in a trackless waste, as אישׁ לא, [Job
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#026.md); עבות לא, [Sa2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004) (Olsh..md).

Job here takes up the tone of Eliphaz (comp. [Job
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013)..md). Intentionally he is made to
excel the friends in a recognition of the absolute majesty of God. He is
not less cognizant of it than they.
