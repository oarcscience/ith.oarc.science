### [Isaiah Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

The Fourfold Melodious Echo - Isaiah 25-26

A. First Echo - [Isa 25:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md)

Salvation of the Nations after the Fall of the Imperial City

There is not merely reflected glory, but reflected sound as well. The
melodious echoes commence with [Isa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md). The prophet, transported to the
end of the days, commemorates what he has seen in psalms and songs.
These psalms and songs not only repeat what has already been predicted;
but, sinking into it, and drawing out of it, they partly expand it
themselves, and partly prepare the way for its further extension.

[Isaiah 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 25:1</span></span>

The first echo is [Isa 25:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md), or more
precisely [Isa 25:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md). The prophet,
whom we already know as a psalmist from [Isa
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md), now acts as choral leader of
the church of the future, and praises Jehovah for having destroyed the
mighty imperial city, and proved Himself a defence and shield against
its tyranny towards His oppressed church. "Jehovah, Thou art my God; I
will exalt Thee, I will praise Thy name, that Thou hast wrought wonders,
counsels from afar, sincerity, truth. For Thou hast turned it from a
city into a heap of stones, the steep castle into a ruin; the palace of
the barbarians from being a city, to be rebuilt no more for ever.
Therefore a wild people will honour Thee, cities of violent nations fear
Thee. For Thou provedst Thyself a stronghold to the lowly, a stronghold
to the poor in his distress, as a shelter from the storm of rain, as a
shadow from the burning of the sun; for the blast of violent ones was
like a storm of rain against a wall. Like the burning of the sun in a
parched land, Thou subduest the noise of the barbarians; (like) the
burning of the sun through the shadow of a cloud, the triumphal song of
violent ones was brought low." The introductory clause is to be
understood as in [Psa 118:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#028.md) : Jehovah
(voc.), my God art Thou. "Thou hast wrought wonders:" this is taken from
[Exo 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md) (as in [Psa
77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015.md); [Psa
78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012.md); like [Isa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002.md), from [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002).md). The wonders which are now
actually wrought are "counsels from afar" (mērâcōk), counsels already
adopted afar off, i.e., long before, thoughts of God belonging to the
olden time; the same ideal view as in [Isa
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011.md); [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026.md) (a parallel which coincides with
our passage on every side), and, in fact, throughout the whole of the
second part. It is the manifold "counsel" of the Holy One of Israel
([Isa 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md); [Isa
14:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024.md); [Isa
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#012.md), [Isa
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#017.md); [Isa
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md); [Isa
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029).md) which displays its wonders in
the events of time. To the verb עשׂית we have also a second and third
object, viz., אמן אמוּנה. It is a common custom with Isaiah to place
derivatives of the same word side by side, for the purpose of giving the
greatest possible emphasis to the idea ([Isa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md); [Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006).md). אמוּנה indicates a quality, אמן
in actual fact. What He has executed is the realization of His
faithfulness, and the reality of His promises. The imperial city is
destroyed. Jehovah, as the first clause which is defined by tzakeph
affirms, has removed it away from the nature of a city into the
condition of a heap of stones. The sentence has its object within
itself, and merely gives prominence to the change that has been
effected; the Lamed is used in the same sense as in [Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013.md) (cf., [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026).md); the min, as in [Isa
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md); [Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md); [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md); [Isa
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#010.md). Mappēlâh, with kametz or tzere
before the tone, is a word that can only be accredited from the book of
Isaiah ([Isa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md); [Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013).md). עיר, קריה, and אמרון are
common parallel words in Isaiah ([Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md); [Isa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002.md); [Isa
32:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013).md); and zârim, as in [Isa
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007.md) and [Isa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md), is the most general epithet for
the enemies of the people of God. The fall of the imperial kingdom is
followed by the conversion of the heathen; the songs proceed from the
mouths of the remotest nations. [Isa
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#003.md) runs parallel with [Rev
15:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md). Nations hitherto rude and
passionate now submit to Jehovah with decorous reverence, and those that
were previously oppressive (‛arı̄tzim, as in [Isa
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011.md), in form like pârı̄tzim,
shâlı̄shı̄m) with humble fear. The cause of this conversion of the heathen
is the one thus briefly indicated in the Apocalypse, "for thy judgments
are made manifest" ([Rev 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004).md). דּל
and אביון (cf., [Isa 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030.md); [Isa
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#019).md) are names well known from the
Psalms, as applying to the church when oppressed. To this church, in the
distress which she had endured (לו בּצּר, as in [Isa
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md); [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md), cf., [Isa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002).md), Jehovah had proved Himself a
strong castle (mâ'ōz; on the expression, compare [Isa
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#003).md), a shelter from storm and a
shade from heat (for the figures, compare [Isa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006.md); [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md); [Isa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#003).md), so that the blast of the
tyrants (compare ruach on [Isa 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#028.md);
[Isa 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011), Ps. 76:13.md) was like a
wall-storm, i.e., a storm striking against a wall (compare [Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003.md), a shoulder-stick, i.e., a stick
which strikes the shoulder), sounding against it and bursting upon it
without being able to wash it away ([Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017.md); [Psa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004).md), because it was the wall of a
strong castle, and this strong castle was Jehovah Himself. As Jehovah
can suddenly subdue the heat of the sun in dryness (tzâyōn, abstract for
concrete, as in [Isa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md), equivalent
to dry land, [Isa 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018).md), and it must
give way when He brings up a shady thicket ([Jer
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029).md), namely of clouds ([Exo
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009.md); [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012).md), so did He suddenly subdue the
thundering (shâ'on, as in [Isa 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012).md)
of the hordes that stormed against His people; and the song of triumph
(zâmı̄r, only met with again in [Sol
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012).md) of the tyrants, which passed
over the world like a scorching heat, was soon "brought low" (‛ânâh, in
its neuter radical signification "to bend," related to כּנע, as in [Isa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 25:6</span></span>

Thus the first hymnic echo dies away; and the eschatological prophecy,
coming back to [Isa 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md), but with
deeper prayerlike penetration, proceeds thus in [Isa
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md) : "And Jehovah of hosts prepares
for all nations upon this mountain a feast of fat things, a feast of
wines on the lees, of fat things rich in marrow, of wines on the lees
thoroughly strained." "This mountain" is Zion, the seat of God's
presence, and the place of His church's worship. The feast is therefore
a spiritual one. The figure is taken, as in [Psa
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027.md)., from the sacrificial meals
connected with the shelâmim (the peace-offerings). Shemârim mezukkâkim
are wines which have been left to stand upon their lees after the first
fermentation is over, which have thus thoroughly fermented, and have
been kept a long time (from shâmar, to keep, spec. to allow to ferment),
and which are then filtered before drinking (Gr. οἶνος σακκίας, i.e.,
διΰλισμένος or διηθικὸς, from διηθεῖν, percolare), hence wine both
strong and clear. Memuchâyı̄m might mean emedullatae ("with the marrow
taken out;" compare, perhaps, [Pro
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#003).md), but this could only apply to
the bones, not to the fat meat itself; the meaning is therefore "mixed
with marrow," made marrowy, medullosae. The thing symbolized in this way
is the full enjoyment of blessedness in the perfected kingdom of God.
The heathen are not only humbled so that they submit to Jehovah, but
they also take part in the blessedness of His church, and are abundantly
satisfied with the good things of His house, and made to drink of
pleasure as from a river ([Psa 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009).md).
The ring of the v. is inimitably pictorial. It is like joyful music to
the heavenly feast. The more flexible form ממחיים (from the original,
ממחי = ממחה) is intentionally chosen in the place of ממּסהים. It is as
if we heard stringed instruments played with the most rapid movement of
the bow.

[Isaiah 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 25:7</span></span>

Although the feast is one earth, it is on an earth which has been
transformed into heaven; for the party-wall between God and the world
has fallen down: death is no more, and all tears are for ever wiped
away. "And He casts away upon this mountain the veil that veiled over
all peoples, and the covering that covered over all nations. He puts
away death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah wipes the tear from every
face; and He removes the shame of His people from the whole earth: for
Jehovah hath spoken it." What Jehovah bestows is followed by what He
puts away. The "veil" and "covering" (massēcâh, from nâsac = mâsâc, [Isa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008.md), from sâcac, to weave, twist, and
twist over = to cover) are not symbols of mourning and affliction, but
of spiritual blindness, like the "veil" upon the heart of Israel
mentioned in [Co2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#015.md). The penē
hallōt (cf., [Job 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#005).md) is the upper
side of the veil, the side turned towards you, by which Jehovah takes
hold of the veil to lift it up. The second hallōt stands for הלּט (Ges.
71, Anm. 1), and is written in this form, according to Isaiah's peculiar
style (vid., [Isa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006.md); [Isa
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#011.md); [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md); [Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013).md), merely for the sake of the
sound, like the obscurer niphal forms in [Isa
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#003.md). The only difference between the
two nouns is this: in lōt the leading idea is that of the completeness
of the covering, and in massēcâh that of its thickness. The removing of
the veil, as well as of death, is called בּלּע, which we find applied to
God in other passages, viz., [Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003.md); [Psa
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md); [Psa
55:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#010.md). Swallowing up is used elsewhere
as equivalent to making a thing disappear, by taking it into one's self;
but here, as in many other instances, the notion of receiving into one's
self is dropped, and nothing remains but the idea of taking away,
unless, indeed, abolishing of death may perhaps be regarded as taking it
back into what hell shows to be the eternal principle of wrath out of
which God called it forth. God will abolish death, so that there shall
be no trace left of its former sway. Paul gives a free rendering of this
passage in [Co1 15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md), κατεπόθη ὁ
θάνατος εἰς νῖκος (after the Aramaean netzach, vincere). The Syriac
combines both ideas, that of the Targum and that of Paul: absorpta est
mors per victoriam in sempiternum. But the abolition of death is not in
itself the perfection of blessedness. There are sufferings which force
out a sigh, even after death has come as a deliverance. But all these
sufferings, whose ultimate ground is sin, Jehovah sweeps away. There is
something very significant in the use of the expression דּמעה (a tear),
which the Apocalypse renders πᾶν δάκρυον ([Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004).md). Wherever there is a tear on any
face whatever, Jehovah wipes it away; and if Jehovah wipes away, this
must be done most thoroughly: He removes the cause with the outward
symptom, the sin as well as the tear. It is self-evident that this
applies to the church triumphant. The world has been judged, and what
was salvable has been saved. There is therefore no more shame for the
people of God. Over the whole earth there is no further place to be
found for this; Jehovah has taken it away. The earth is therefore a holy
dwelling-place for blessed men. The new Jerusalem is Jehovah's throne,
but the whole earth is Jehovah's glorious kingdom. The prophet is here
looking from just the same point of view as Paul in [Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028.md), and John in the last page of
the Apocalypse.

[Isaiah 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 25:9</span></span>

After this prophetic section, which follows the first melodious echo
like an interpolated recitative, the song of praise begins again; but it
is soon deflected into the tone of prophecy. The shame of the people of
God, mentioned in [Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md), recals to
mind the special enemies of the church in its immediate neighbourhood,
who could not tyrannize over it indeed, like the empire of the world,
but who nevertheless scoffed at it and persecuted it. The representative
and emblem of these foes are the proud and boasting Moab ([Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006.md); [Jer
48:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029).md). All such attempts as that of
Knobel to turn this into history are but so much lost trouble. Moab is a
mystic name. It is the prediction of the humiliation of Moab in this
spiritual sense, for which the second echo opens the way by celebrating
Jehovah's appearing. Jehovah is now in His manifested presence the
conqueror of death, the drier of tears, the saviour of the honour of His
oppressed church. "And they say in that day, Behold our God, for whom we
waited to help us: this is Jehovah, for whom we waited; let us be glad
and rejoice in His salvation." The undefined but self-evident subject to
v'âmar ("they say") is the church of the last days. "Behold:" hinnēh and
zeh belong to one another, as in [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md). The waiting may be understood as
implying a retrospective glance at all the remote past, even as far back
as Jacob's saying, "I wait for Thy salvation, O Jehovah" ([Gen
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018).md). The appeal, "Let us be glad,"
etc., has passed over into the grand hodu of [Psa
118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024.md).

[Isaiah 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 25:10</span></span>

In the land of promise there is rejoicing, but on the other side of the
Jordan there is fear of ruin. Two contrasted pictures are placed here
side by side. The Jordan is the same as the "great gulf" in the parable
of the rich man. Upon Zion Jehovah descends in mercy, but upon the
highlands of Moab in His wrath. "For the hand of Jehovah will sink down
upon this mountain, and Moab is trodden down there where it is, as straw
is trodden down in the water of the dung-pit. And he spreadeth out his
hands in the pool therein, as the swimmer spreadeth them out to swim;
but Jehovah forceth down the pride of Moab in spite of the artifices of
his hands. Yea, thy steep, towering walls He bows down, forces under,
and casts earthwards into dust." Jehovah brings down His hand upon Zion
(nūach, as in [Isa 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#002.md); [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md), not only to shelter, but also
to avenge. Israel, that has been despised, He now makes glorious, and
for contemptuous Moab He prepares a shameful end. In the place where it
now is תּחתּיו, as in [Sa2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010.md); [Hab
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016.md), "in its own place," its own
land) it is threshed down, stamped or trodden down, as straw is trodden
down into a dung-pit to turn it into manure: hiddūsh, the inf. constr.,
with the vowel sound u, possibly to distinguish it from the inf. absol.
hiddosh (Ewald, 240, b). Instead of בּמו (as in [Isa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002).md), the chethib has בּמי (cf., [Job
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030).md); and this is probably the more
correct reading, since madmēnâh, by itself, means the dunghill, and not
the tank of dung water. At the same time, it is quite possible that b'mo
is intended as a play upon the name Moab, just as the word madmēnâh may
possibly have been chosen with a play upon the Moabitish Madmēn ([Jer
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002).md). In [Isa
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#011.md) Jehovah would be the subject, if
b'kirbo (in the midst of it) referred back to Moab; but although the
figure of Jehovah pressing down the pride of Moab, by spreading out His
hands within it like a swimmer, might produce the impression of boldness
and dignity in a different connection, yet here, where Moab has just
been described as forced down into the manure-pit, the comparison of
Jehovah to a swimmer would be a very offensive one. The swimmer is Moab
itself, as Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, and in fact the majority of
commentators suppose. "In the midst of it:" b'kirbo points back in a
neuter sense to the place into which Moab had been violently plunged,
and which was so little adapted for swimming. A man cannot swim in a
manure pond; but Moab attempts it, though without success, for Jehovah
presses down the pride of Moab in spite of its artifices עם, as in [Neh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#018.md); ארבּות, written with dagesh
(according to the majority of MSS, from ארבּה, like the Arabic urbe,
irbe, cleverness, wit, sharpness), i.e., the skilful and cunning
movement of its hands. Saad. gives it correctly, as muchâtale, wiles and
stratagems; Hitzig also renders it "machinations," i.e., twistings and
turnings, which Moab makes with its arms, for the purpose of keeping
itself up in the water. What [Isa
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#011.md) affirms in figure, [Isa
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#012.md) illustrates without any figure.
If the reading were מבצרך חומות משׂגּב, the reference would be to
Kir-Moab ([Isa 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md); [Isa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007).md). But as the text stands, we are
evidently to understand by it the strong and lofty walls of the cities
of Moab in general.
