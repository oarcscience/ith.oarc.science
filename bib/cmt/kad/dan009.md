The Seventy Weeks

In the first year of Darius the Median, Daniel, by a diligent study of
the prophecies of Jeremiah as to the number of years during which
Jerusalem must lie desolate ([Dan 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001.md),
[Dan 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002).md), was led to pour forth a
penitential prayer, in which he acknowledges the justice of the divine
chastisement which hung over Israel on account of their sins, and
entreats the mercy of God in behalf of his people (vv. 3-19). In
consequence of this prayer, the angel Gabriel ([Dan
9:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020).md) must pass over his people and
the holy city before the consummation of the kingdom of God.

[Daniel 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 9:1</span></span>

[Dan 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001.md) and [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md) mention the occasion on which the
penitential prayer (vv. 3-19) was offered, and the divine revelation
following thereupon regarding the time and the course of the oppression
of the people of God by the world-power till the completion of God's
plan of salvation.

Regarding Darius, the son of Ahasverosch, of the race of the Medes, see
under [Dan 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001.md). In the word המלך the
Hophal is to be noticed: rex constitutus, factus est. It shows that
Darius did not become king over the Chaldean kingdom by virtue of a
hereditary right to it, nor that he gained the kingdom by means of
conquest, but that he received it (קבּל, [Dan
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001).md) from the conqueror of Babylon,
Cyrus, the general of the army. The first year of the reign of Darius
the Mede over the Chaldean kingdom is the year 538 b.c., since Babylon
was taken by the Medes and Persians under Cyrus in the year 539-538 b.c.
According to Ptolemy, Cyrus the Persian reigned nine years after
Nabonadius. But the death of Cyrus, as is acknowledged, occurred in the
year 529 b.c. From the nine years of the reign of Cyrus, according to
our exposition, two years are to be deducted for Darius the Mede, so
that the reign of Cyrus by himself over the kingdom which he founded
begins in the year 536, in which year the seventy years of the
Babylonish exile of the Jews were completed; cf. The exposition under
[Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md) with the chronological survey
in the Com. on the Books of the Kings.

The statement as to the time, [Dan
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001.md), is again repeated in the
beginning of [Dan 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md), on account of
the relative sentence coming between, so as to connect that which
follows with it. We translate (in [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002).md), with Hgstb., Maur., Hitzig, "I
marked, or gave heed, in the Scriptures to the number of the years," so
that מספּר (number) forms the object to בּינתי (I understood); cf. [Pro
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#007.md). Neither the placing of בּספרים
(by books) first nor the Atnach under this word controvert this view;
for the object is placed after "by books" because a further definition
is annexed to it; and the separation of the object from the verb by the
Atnach is justified by this consideration, that the passage contains two
statements, viz., that Daniel studied the Scriptures, and that his study
was directed to the number of the years, etc. בּספרים, with the definite
article, does not denote a collection of known sacred writings in which
the writings of Jeremiah were included, so that, seeing the collection
of the prophets cannot be thought of without the Pentateuch, by this
word we are to understand (with Bleek, Gesenius, v. Leng., Hitzig) the
recognised collection of the O.T. writings, the Law and the Prophets.
For הסּפרים, τὰ βιβλιά, is not synonymous with הכּתוּבים, αἱ γραφαί, but
denotes only writings in the plural, but does not say that these
writings formed already a recognised collection; so that from this
expression nothing can be concluded regarding the formation of the O.T.
canon. As little can בּספרים refer, with Hv. and Kran., to the letter of
Jeremiah to the exiles (Jer 29), for this reason, that not in Jer 29,
but in [Jer 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md)., the seventy years
of the desolation of the land of Judah, and implic. of Jerusalem, are
mentioned. The plur. ספרים also can be understood of a single letter,
only if the context demands or makes appropriate this narrower
application of the word, as e.g., [Kg2
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#014.md). But here this is not the case,
since Jeremiah in two separate prophecies speaks of the seventy years,
and not in the letter of Jer. 29, but only in Jer. 25, has he spoken of
the seventy years' desolation of the land. In בּספרים lies nothing
further than that writings existed, among which were to be found the
prophecies of Jeremiah; and the article, the writings, is used, because
in the following passage something definite is said of these writings.

In these writings Daniel considered the number of the years of which
Jeremiah had prophesied. אשׁר, as [Dan
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026.md), with respect to which, relates
not to השׁנים, but to השׁנים מספּר (number of the years). It is no
objection against this that the repetition of the words "seventy years"
stands opposed to this connection (Klief.), for this repetition does not
exist, since מספּר does not declare the number of the years. With למלּאת
(to fulfil) the contents of the word of Jehovah, as given by Jeremiah,
are introduced. לחרבות does not stand for the accusative: to cause to be
complete the desolation of Jerusalem (Hitzig), but ל signifies in
respect of, with regard to. This expression does not lean on [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010) (Kran..md), but on [Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md) ("when seventy years are
accomplished"). חרבות, properly, desolated places, ruins, here a
desolated condition. Jerusalem did not certainly lie in ruins for
seventy years; the word is not thus to be interpreted, but is chosen
partly with regard to the existing state of Jerusalem, and partly with
reference to the words of [Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md),
[Jer 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md). Yet the desolation began
with the first taking of Jerusalem, and the deportation of Daniel and
his companions and a part of the sacred vessels of the temple, in the
fourth years of Jehoiakim (606 b.c.).

(Note: Thus also the seventy years of the Exile are reckoned in [Ch2
36:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021.md); [Ezr
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md). This Ewald also recognises
(Proph. iii. p. 430), but thinks that it is not an exact reckoning of
the times, but rather, according to [Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md) and [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), that the destruction of
Jerusalem forms the date of the commencement of the desolation and of
the seventy years. But [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md)
contains no expression, or even intimation, regarding the commencement
of the Exile; and in the words of [Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md), "against which Thou hast had
indignation these threescore and ten years," there does not lie the idea
that the seventy years prophesied of by Jeremiah came to an end in the
second year of Darius Hystaspes. See under this passage.)

Consequently, in the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede over the
kingdom of the Chaldeans the seventy years prophesied of by Jeremiah
were now full, the period of the desolation of Jerusalem determined by
God was almost expired. What was it that moved Daniel at this time to
pour forth a penitential prayer in behalf of Jerusalem and the desolated
sanctuary? Did he doubt the truth of the promise, that God, after
seventy years of exile in Babylon, would visit His people and fulfil the
good word He had spoken, that He would again bring back His people to
Judea ([Jer 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md)? Certainly not,
since neither the matter of his prayer, nor the divine revelation which
was vouchsafed to him in answer to his prayer, indicated any doubt on
his part regarding the divine promise.

According to the opinion of Bleek and Ewald, it was Daniel's uncertainty
regarding the termination of the seventy years which moved him to prayer
Bleek (Jahrbb.f. D. Theol. v. p. 71) thus expresses himself on the
subject: "This prophecy of Jeremiah might be regarded as fulfilled in
the overthrow of the Babylonian kingdom and the termination of the
Exile, when the Jews obtained from Cyrus permission to return to their
native land and to rebuild their city and temple, but yet not perfectly,
so far as with the hope of the return of the people from exile there was
united the expectation that they would then turn in truth to their God,
and that Jehovah would fulfil all His good promises to them to make them
partakers of the Messianic redemption (cf. [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md)., also other prophecies of
Jeremiah and of other prophets regarding the return of the people from
exile, such as Isa. 40ff.); but this result was not connected in such
extent and fulness with the return of the people and the restoration of
the state." On the supposition of the absolute inspiration of the
prophets, it appeared therefore appropriate "to regard Jeremiah's
prophecy of the seventy years, after the expiry of which God will fulfil
His good promises to His people, as stretching out into a later period
beyond that to which the seventy years would extend, and on that account
to inquire how it was to be properly interpreted." Ewald (Proph. iii. p.
421ff.) is of opinion that these seventy years of Jeremiah did not pass
by without the fulfilment of his prophecy, that the ruins of Jerusalem
would not continue for ever. Already forty-nine years after its
destruction a new city of Jerusalem took the place of the old as the
centre of the congregation of the true religion, but the stronger hopes
regarding the Messianic consummation which connected itself herewith
were neither then, nor in all the long times following, down to that
moment in which our author (in the age of the Maccabees) lived and
wrote, ever fulfilled. Then the faithful were everywhere again exposed
to the severest sufferings, such as they had not experienced since the
old days of the destruction of Jerusalem. Therefore the anxious question
as to the duration of such persecution and the actual beginning of the
Messianic time, which Daniel, on the ground of the mysterious intimation
in [Dan 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#012.md), [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md) and [Dan
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md)., regarding the period of the
sufferings of the time of the end, sought here to solve, is agitated
anew; for he shows how the number of the seventy years of Jeremiah,
which had long ago become sacred, yet accorded with these late times
without losing its original truth. Thus Ewald argues.

These two critics in their reasoning proceed on the dogmatic ground,
which they regard as firmly established, that the book of Daniel is a
product of the age of the Maccabees. All who oppose the genuineness of
this book agree with them in the view that this chapter contains an
attempt, clothed in the form of a divine revelation communicated to the
prophet in answer to his prayer, to solve the mystery how Jeremiah's
prophecy of the beginning of the Messianic salvation after the seventy
years of exile is to be harmonized with the fact that this salvation,
centuries after the fall of the Babylonish kingdom and the return of the
Jews from the Babylonish exile, had not yet come, but that instead of
it, under Antiochus Epiphanes, a time of the severest oppression had
come. How does this opinion stand related to the matter of this chapter,
leaving out of view all other grounds for the genuineness of the book of
Daniel? Does the prayer of Daniel, or the divine revelation communicated
to him by means of Gabriel regarding the seventy weeks, contain elements
which attest its correctness or probability?

The prayer of Daniel goes forth in the earnest entreaty that the Lord
would turn away His anger from the city Jerusalem and His holy mountain,
and cause His face to shine on the desolation and on the city that was
called by His name ([Dan 9:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015).md). If
this prayer is connected with the statement in [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md), that Daniel was moved thereto by
the consideration of the words of Jeremiah regarding the desolation of
Jerusalem, we can understand by the ruins, for the removal of which
Daniel prayed, only the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple which
was brought about by the Chaldeans. Consequently the prayer indicates
that the desolation of Jerusalem predicted by Jeremiah and accomplished
by Nebuchadnezzar still continued, and that the city and the temple had
not yet been rebuilt. This, therefore, must have been in the time of the
Exile, and not in the time of Antiochus, who, it is true, desolated the
sanctuary by putting an end to the worship of Jehovah and establishing
the worship of idols, but did not lay in ruins either the temple or the
city.

In his message ([Dan 9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md) the
angel speaks only of the going forth of the word to restore and rebuild
Jerusalem, and present the going forth of this word as the beginning of
the seventy weeks of Daniel determined upon the people and the holy city
within which Jerusalem must be built, and thus distinguishes the seventy
weeks as distinctly as possible from Jeremiah's seventy years during
which Jerusalem and Judah should lie desolate. Thus is set aside the
opinion that the author of this chapter sought to interpret the seventy
years of Jeremiah by the seventy weeks; and it shows itself to be only
the pure product of the dogmatic supposition, that this book does not
contain prophecies of the prophet Daniel living in the time of the
Exile, but only apocalyptic dreams of a Maccabean Jew.

(Note: The supposition that the seventy weeks, [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), are an interpretation of the
seventy years of Jeremiah, is the basis on which Hitzig rests the
assertion that the passage does not well adjust itself to the standpoint
of the pretended Daniel, but is in harmony with the time of the
Maccabees. The other arguments which Hitzig and others bring forth
against this chapter as the production of Daniel, consist partly in vain
historical or dogmatic assertions, such as that there are doubts
regarding the existence of Darius of Media, - partly in
misinterpretations, such as that Daniel wholly distinguishes himself,
[Dan 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#006.md), [Dan
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#010.md), from the prophets, and presents
himself as a reader of their writings (Hitz.), - opinions which are no
better founded than the conclusions of Berth., v. Leng., and Staeh.,
drawn from the mention of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, [Dan
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007.md), and of the holy city, [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), that Jerusalem was then still
inhabited and the temple still standing. To this it is added, that the
prayer of Daniel is an imitation of the prayers of [Ezr
9:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md) and Neh 9, or, as Ewald thinks,
an extract from the prayer of Baruch (Bar. 1 and 2).)

Moreover, it is certainly true that in the Exile the expectation that
the perfection and glory of the kingdom of God by the Messiah would
appear along with the liberation of the Jews from Babylon was founded on
the predictions of the earlier prophets, but that Daniel shared this
expectation the book presents no trace whatever. Jeremiah also, neither
in Jer. 25 nor in Jer. 29, where he speaks of the seventy years of the
domination of Babylon, announces that the Messianic salvation would
begin immediately with the downfall of the Babylonian kingdom. In Jer.
25 he treats only of the judgment, first over Judah, and then over
Babylon and all the kingdoms around; and in Jer. 29 he speaks, it is
true, of the fulfilling of the good word of the return of the Jews to
their fatherland when seventy years shall be fulfilled for Babylon ([Dan
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#010).md), and of the counsel of Jehovah,
which is formed not for the destruction but for the salvation of His
people, of the restoration of the gracious relation between Jehovah and
His people, and the gathering together and the bringing back of the
prisoners from among all nations whither they had been scattered ([Dan
9:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011).md), but he says not a word to
lead to the idea that all this would take place immediately after these
seventy years.

Now if Daniel, in the first year of Darius the Mede, i.e., in the
sixty-ninth year of the Exile, prayed thus earnestly for the restoration
of Jerusalem and the sanctuary, he must have been led to do so from a
contemplation of the then existing state of things. The political aspect
of the world-kingdom could scarcely have furnished to him such a motive.
The circumstance that Darius did not immediately after the fall of
Babylon grant permission to the Jews to return to their fatherland and
rebuild Jerusalem and the temple, could not make him doubt the certainty
of the fulfilment of the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah regarding
the duration of the Exile, since the prophecy of Isaiah, [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028), that Coresch (Cyrus.md) should
build Jerusalem and lay the foundation of the temple was beyond question
known to him, and Darius had in a certain sense reached the sovereignty
over the Chaldean kingdom, and was of such an age ([Dan
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001).md) that now his reign must be near
its end, and Cyrus would soon mount his throne as his successor. That
which moved Daniel to prayer was rather the religious condition of his
own people, among whom the chastisement of the Exile had not produced
the expected fruits of repentance; so that, though he did not doubt
regarding the speedy liberation of his people from Babylonish exile, he
might still hope for the early fulfilment of the deliverance prophesied
of after the destruction of Babylon and the return of the Jews to
Canaan. This appears from the contents of the prayer. From the beginning
to the close it is pervaded by sorrow on account of the great sinfulness
of the people, among whom also there were no signs of repentance. The
prayer for the turning away of the divine wrath Daniel grounds solely on
the mercy of God, and upon that which the Lord had already done for His
people by virtue of His covenant faithfulness, the צדקות (righteousness)
of the Lord, not the "righteousness" of the people. This confession of
sin, and this entreaty for mercy, show that the people, as a whole, were
not yet in that spiritual condition in which they might expect the
fulfilment of that promise of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah ([Jer
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012)..md): "Ye shall seek me and find
me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart; and I will be found
of you, and will turn away your captivity," etc.

With this view of the contents of the prayer corresponds the divine
answer which Gabriel brings to the prophet, the substance of which is to
this effect, that till the accomplishment of God's plan of salvation in
behalf of His people, yet seventy weeks are appointed, and that during
this time great and severe tribulations would fall upon the people and
the city.

[Daniel 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 9:3</span></span>

Daniel's prayer. This prayer has been judged very severely by modern
critics. According to Berth., v. Leng., Hitzig, Staeh., and Ewald, its
matter and its whole design are constructed according to older patterns,
in particular according to the prayers of Neh 9 and [Ezr
9:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md), since [Dan
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004.md) is borrowed from [Neh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#005.md); [Neh
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032.md); [Dan
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#008.md) from [Neh
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#034.md); [Dan
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#014.md) from [Neh
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#033.md); [Dan
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015.md) from [Neh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#010.md); [Neh
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#010.md); and, finally, [Dan
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007.md), [Dan
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#008.md) from [Ezr
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007.md). But if we consider this
dependence more closely, we shall, it is true, find the expression הפנים
בּשׁת (confusion of faces, [Ezr 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007.md),
[Ezr 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008).md) in [Ezr
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007.md), but we also find it in [Ch2
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021.md); [Jer
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#019.md), and also in [Psa
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#016.md); סלחות (forgivenesses, [Dan
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#009).md) we find in [Neh
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017.md), but also in [Psa
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md); and על תּתּך (is poured upon,
spoken of the anger of God, [Dan 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011).md)
is found not only in [Ch2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#007.md); [Ch2
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#021.md), [Ch2
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#025.md), but also [Jer
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018.md); [Jer
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#006.md), and [Nah
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006.md). We have only to examine the other
parallel common thoughts and words adduced in order at once to perceive
that, without exception, they all have their roots in the Pentateuch,
and afford not the slightest proof of the dependence of this chapter on
Neh 9.

The thought, "great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy,"
etc., which is found in [Dan 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004.md) and
in [Neh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#005.md), has its roots in [Deu
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021.md) and [Dan
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#009.md), cf. [Exo
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006.md); [Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md), and in the form found in [Neh
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032.md), in [Deu
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017.md); the expression ([Dan
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015).md), "Thou hast brought Thy people
forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand," has its origin in
[Deu 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008.md); [Deu
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#026.md), etc. But in those verses where
single thoughts or words of this prayer so accord with Neh 9 or [Ezr
9:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md) as to show a dependence, a
closer comparison will prove, not that Daniel borrows from Ezra or
Nehemiah, but that they borrow from Daniel. This is put beyond a doubt
by placing together the phrases: "our kings, our princes, our fathers"
([Dan 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005.md), [Dan
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#008).md), compared with these: "our kings,
our princes, our priests, and our fathers" ([Neh
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#034.md), [Neh
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032).md), and "our kings and our priests"
([Ezr 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007).md). For here the naming of the
"priests" along with the "kings and princes" is just as characteristic
of the age of Ezra and Nehemiah as the omission of the "priests" is of
the time of the Exile, in which, in consequence of the cessation of
worship, the office of the priest was suspended. This circumstance tends
to refute the argument of Sthelin (Einl. p. 349), that since the prayers
in Chron., Ezra, and Nehem. greatly resemble each other, and probably
proceed from one author, it is more likely that the author of Daniel 9
depended on the most recent historical writings, than that Daniel 9 was
always before the eyes of the author of Chron. - a supposition the
probability of which is not manifest.

If, without any preconceived opinion that this book is a product of the
times of the Maccabees, the contents and the course of thought found in
the prayer, Daniel 9, are compared with the prayers in [Ezr
9:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md) and Neh 9, we will not easily
suppose it possible that Daniel depends on Ezra and Nehemiah. The prayer
of [Ezr 9:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#006.md) is a confession of the
sins of the congregation from the days of the fathers down to the time
of Ezra, in which Ezra scarcely ventures to raise his countenance to
God, because as a member of the congregation he is borne down by the
thought of their guilt; and therefore he does not pray for pardon,
because his design is only "to show to the congregation how greatly they
had gone astray, and to induce them on their part to do all to atone for
their guilt, and to turn away the anger of God" (Bertheau).

The prayer, Neh 9:6-37, is, after the manner of Ps 105 and 106, an
extended offering of praise for all the good which the Lord had
manifested toward His people, notwithstanding that they had continually
hardened their necks and revolted from His from the time of the call of
Abraham down to the time of the exile, expressing itself in the
confession, "God is righteous, but we are guilty," never rising to a
prayer for deliverance from bondage, under which the people even then
languished.

The prayer of Daniel 9, on the contrary, by its contents and form, not
only creates the impression "of a fresh production adapted to the
occasion," and also of great depth of thought and of earnest power in
prayer, but it presents itself specially as the prayer of a man, a
prophet, standing in a near relation to God, so that we perceive that
the suppliant probably utters the confession of sin and of guilt in the
name of the congregation in which he is included; but in the prayer for
the turning away of God's anger his special relation to the Lord is
seen, and is pleaded as a reason for his being heard, in the words,
"Hear the prayer of Thy servant and his supplication ([Dan
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017).md); O my God, incline Thine ear"
([Dan 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018).md).

(Note: After the above remarks, Ewald's opinion, that this prayer is
only an epitome of the prayer of Baruch (1:16-3:8), scarcely needs any
special refutation. It is open before our eyes, and has been long known,
that the prayer of Baruch in the whole course of its thoughts, and in
many of the expressions found in it, fits closely to the prayer of
Daniel; but also all interpreters not blinded by prejudice have long ago
acknowledged that from the resemblances of this apocryphal product not
merely to Daniel 9, but also much more to Jeremiah, nothing further
follows than that the author of this late copy of ancient prophetic
writings knew and used the book of Daniel, and was familiar with the
writings of Daniel and Jeremiah, and of other prophets, so that he
imitated them. This statement, that the pseudo-Baruch in ch. 1:15-3:8
presents an extended imitation of Daniel's prayer, Ewald has not
refuted, and he has brought forward nothing more in support of his view
than the assertion, resting on the groundless supposition that the
mention of the "judges" in [Dan 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#012.md)
is derived from Bar. 2:1, and on the remark that the author of the book
of Baruch would have nothing at all peculiar if he had formed that long
prayer out of the book of Daniel, or had only wrought after this pattern
- a remark which bears witness, indeed, of a compassionate concern for
his protge, but manifestly says nothing for the critic.)

The prayer is divided into two parts. [Dan
9:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004.md) contain the confession of sin
and guilt; [Dan 9:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015.md) the
supplication for mercy, and the restoration of the holy city and its
sanctuary lying in ruins.

The confession of sin divides itself into two strophes. [Dan
9:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004.md) state the transgression and the
guilt, while [Dan 9:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011.md) refer to the
punishment from God for this guilt. [Dan
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003.md) forms the introduction. The words,
"Then I directed my face to the Lord," are commonly understood, after
[Dan 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#011.md), as meaning that Daniel
turned his face toward the place of the temple, toward Jerusalem. This
is possible. The words themselves, however, only say that he turned his
face to God the Lord in heaven, to האלהים אדני, the Lord of the whole
world, the true God, not to יהוה, although he meant the covenant God.
"To seek prayer in (with) fasting," etc. "Fasting in sackcloth
(penitential garment made of hair) and ashes," i.e., sprinkling the head
with ashes as an outward sign of true humility and penitence, comes into
consideration as a means of preparation for prayer, in order that one
might place himself in the right frame of mind for prayer, which is an
indispensable condition for the hearing of it - a result which is the
aim in the seeking. In regard to this matter Jerome makes these
excellent remarks: "In cinere igitur et sacco postulat impleri quod Deus
promiserat, non quod esset incredulus futurorum, sed ne securitas
negligentiam et negligentia pareret offensam." תּפלּה and תּחנוּנים =
תּחנּה, cf. [Kg1 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#038.md), [Kg1
8:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#045.md), [Kg1
8:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#049.md); [Ch2
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#029.md), [Ch2
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#035.md). תּפלּה is prayer in general;
תּחנוּנים, prayer for mercy and compassion, as also a petition for
something, such as the turning away of misfortune or evil (deprecari).
The design of the prayer lying before us is to entreat God that He would
look with pity on the desolation of the holy city and the temple,and
fulfil His promise of their restoration. This prayer is found in [Dan
9:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015.md).

[Dan 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004.md)

Since the desolation of the holy land and the exile of the people was a
well-deserved punishment for their sins, and a removal of the punishment
could not be hoped for without genuine humiliation under the righteous
judgment of God, Daniel begins with a confession of the great
transgression of the people, and of the righteousness of the divine
dealings with them, that on the ground of this confession he might
entreat of the divine compassion the fulfilment of the promised
restoration of Jerusalem and Israel. He prays to Jehovah אלהי, my God.
If we wish our prayers to be heard, then God, to whom we pray, must
become our God. To אתודּה (I made confession) M. Geier applies
Augustine's beautiful remark on [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md) : "Confession gemina est, aut
peccati aut laudis. Quando nobis male est in tribulationibus,
confiteamur peccata nostra; quando nobis bene est in exultatione
justitiae, confiteamur laudem Deo: sine confessione tamen non simus."
The address, "Thou great and dreadful God, who keepest the covenant,"
etc., points in its first part to the mighty acts of God in destroying
His enemies (cf. [Deu 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021).md), and in
the second part to the faithfulness of God toward those that fear Him in
fulfilling His promises (cf. [Deu
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009).md). While the greatness and the
terribleness of God, which Israel had now experienced, wrought
repentance and sorrow, the reference to the covenant faithfulness of God
served to awaken and strengthen their confidence in the help of the
Almighty.

[Dan 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005.md)

God is righteous and faithful, but Israel is unrighteous and faithless.
The confession of the great guilt of Israel in [Dan
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005.md) connects itself with the praise of
God. This guilt Daniel confesses in the strongest words. חטא, to make a
false step, designates sin as an erring from the right; עוה, to be
perverse, as unrighteousness; רשׁע, to do wrong, as a passionate
rebellion against God. To these three words, which Solomon ([Kg1
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#047).md) had already used as an
exhaustive expression of a consciousness of sin and guilt, and the
Psalmist ([Psa 106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006).md) had repeated as
the confession of the people in exile, Daniel yet further adds the
expression מרדנוּ, we have rebelled against God, and סור, are departed,
fallen away from His commandments; this latter word being in the inf.
absol., thereby denotes that the action is presented with emphasis.

[Dan 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#006.md)

The guilt becomes the greater from the fact that God failed not to warn
them, and that Israel would not hear the words of the prophets, who in
His name spoke to high and low, - to kings and princes, i.e., the heads
of tribes and families, and to the great men of the kingdom and to the
fathers, i.e., to their ancestors, in this connection with the exclusion
of kings and chiefs of the people, who are specially named, as [Jer
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017.md), cf. [Neh
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032.md), [Neh
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#034.md); not perhaps the elders, heads of
families (Cocceius, J. D. Michaelis, and others), or merely teachers
(Ewald). To illustrate the meaning, there is added the expression "the
whole people of the land," not merely the common people, so that no one
might regard himself as exempted. Compare כּל־עמך, [Neh
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032.md). This expression, comprehending
all, is omitted when the thought is repeated in [Dan
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#008.md).

[Dan 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007.md)

Thus to God belongeth righteousness, but to the sinful people only
shame. הצדקה לך does not mean: Thine was the righteous cause (Hitzig).
The interpolation of the was is arbitrary, and צדקה predicated of God is
not righteous cause, but righteousness as a perfection which is
manifested in His operations on the earth, or specially in His dealings
toward Israel. הפנים בּשׁת, shame which reflects itself in the
countenance, not because of disgraceful circumstances, [Ezr
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007) (Kranichfeld.md), but in the
consciousness of well-deserved suffering. הזּה כּיום does not mean: at
this time, to-day, now (Hv., v. Leng., and others); the interpretation
of כ in the sense of circa stands opposed to the definite הזּה. In the
formula הזּה כּיום the כ has always the meaning of a comparison; also in
[Jer 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#006.md), [Jer
44:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#022.md); [Sa1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#008.md), and everywhere the expression
has this meaning: as it happened this day, as experience has now shown
or shows. See under [Deu 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030.md). Here it
relates merely to הף/ ot yl בּשׁת לנוּ (to us shame, etc.), not also the
first part of the verse. The לנוּ is particularized by the words, "the
men of Judah" (אישׁ collectively, since the plur. אישׁים in this
connection cannot be used; it occurs only three times in the O.T.), "and
the inhabitants of Jerusalem." Both together are the citizens of the
kingdom of Judah. ישׂראל, the whole of the rest of Israel, the members
of the kingdom of the ten tribes. To both of these the further
definition relates: "those that are near, and those that are far off,
etc." With m' אשׁר בּמעלם (because of their trespass which," etc.), cf.
[Lev 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md).

[Dan 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#008.md)

In this verse Daniel repeats the thoughts of [Dan
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007.md) in order to place the sin and
shame of the people opposite to the divine compassion, and then to pass
from confession of sin to supplication for the sin-forgiving grace of
the covenant-keeping God.

[Dan 9:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#009.md)

Compassion and forgiveness are with the Lord our God; and these we need,
for we have rebelled against Him. This thought is expanded in [Dan
9:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#010.md). The rebellion against God,
the refusing to hear the voice of the Lord through the prophets, the
transgression of His law, of which all Israel of the twelve tribes were
guilty, has brought the punishment on the whole people which the law of
Moses threatened against transgressors.

[Dan 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011.md)

ותּתּך with ו consec.: therefore has the curse poured itself out, and
the oath, i.e., the curse strengthened with an oath. נתך, to pour forth,
of storms of rain and hail ([Exo
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#033).md), but especially of the
destroying fire-rain of the divine wrath, cf. [Nah
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006.md) with [Gen
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md), and [Jer
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#020.md); [Jer
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018.md); [Jer
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#006.md). האלה is used, [Deu
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md)., of the threatenings against
the transgressors of the law in [Lev
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014.md)., [Deu
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015.md)., to which Daniel here makes
reference. To strengthen the expression, he has added השּׁבעה (and the
oath) to האלה, after [Num 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#021.md); cf.
also [Neh 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#030.md).

[Dan 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#012.md)

In this verse the Kethiv דּבריו, in harmony with the ancient versions,
is to be maintained, and the Keri only as an explanation inferred from
the thought of a definite curse. "Our judges" is an expression
comprehending the chiefs of the people, kings and princes, as in Ps.
20:10; [Psa 148:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#011.md).

[Dan 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#013.md)

The thought of [Dan 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011.md) is again
taken up once more to declare that God, by virtue of His righteousness,
must carry out against the people the threatening contained in His law.
את before כּל־הרעה is not, with Kranichfeld, to be explained from the
construction of the passive כּתוּב with the accusative, for it does not
depend on כּתוּב no, but serves to introduce the subject absolutely
stated: as concerns all this evil, thus it has come upon us, as [Eze
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#003.md); [Jer
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#004.md); cf. Ewald's Lehrb. 277d.
Regarding את־פּני חלּינוּ (we entreated the face, etc.), cf. [Zac
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002.md); [Zac
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021.md). להשׂכּיל בּאמתּך is not to be
translated: to comprehend Thy faithfulness (Hitzig), for the
construction with ב does not agree with this, and then אמת does not mean
faithfulness (Treue), but truth (Warheit). The truth of God is His plan
of salvation revealed in His word, according to which the sinner can
only attain to happiness and salvation by turning to God and obeying His
commands.

[Dan 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#014.md)

Because Israel did not do this, therefore the Lord watched upon the
evil, i.e., continually thought thereon - an idea very frequently found
in Jeremiah; cf. [Jer 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#012.md); [Jer
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028.md); [Jer
44:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#027.md). צדּיק with על following,
righteous on the ground of all His works - a testimony from experience;
cf. [Neh 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#033) (Kranichfeld.md).

[Dan 9:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015.md)

After this confession, there now follows the prayer for the turning away
of the wrath ([Dan 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015.md) and [Dan
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#016).md) of God, and for the
manifestation of His grace toward His suppliant people ([Dan
9:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017).md).

[Dan 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015.md)

This prayer Daniel founds on the great fact of the deliverance of Israel
out of Egypt, by which the Lord made for Himself a name among the
nations. Jerome has here rightly remarked, not exhausting the thought
however: "memor est antiqui beneficii, ut ad similem Dei clementiam
provocet." For Daniel does not view the deliverance of Israel out of
Egypt merely as a good deed, but as an act of salvation by which God
fulfilled His promise He had given to the patriarchs, ratified the
covenant He made with Abraham, and by the miracles accompanying the
exodus of the tribes of Israel from the land of Egypt, glorified His
name before all nations (cf. Isa. 63:32, 13), so that Moses could appeal
to this glorious revelation of God among the heathen as an argument, in
his prayer for pardon to Israel, to mitigate the anger of God which
burned against the apostasy and the rebellion of the people, and to turn
away the threatened destruction, [Exo
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md)., [Num
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md). Jeremiah, and also Isaiah, in
like manner ground their prayer for mercy to Israel on the name of the
Lord, [Jer 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#020.md)., [Isa
63:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011.md). Nehemiah ([Neh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#010.md) and [Neh
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#010).md) in this agrees with Jeremiah and
Daniel. הזּה כּיום, in the same connection in Jer 50, does not mean,
then, at that time, but, as this day still: (hast gotten Thee) a name as
Thou hast it still. In order to rest the prayer alone on the honour of
the Lord, on the honour of His name, Daniel again repeats the
confession, we have sinned, we have done wickedly; cf. [Dan
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005.md).

[Dan 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#016.md)

The prayer for the turning away of God's anger follows, and is
introduced by a repetition of the address, "O Lord," and by a brief
condensation of the motive developed in [Dan
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015.md), by the words כּכל־צדקתיך. צדקות
does not mean in a gracious manner, and צדק is not grace, but proofs of
the divine righteousness. The meaning of the words כּכל־צדקתיך is not:
as all proofs of Thy righteousness have hitherto been always intimately
connected with a return of Thy grace, so may it also now be (Kran.);
but, according to all the proofs of Thy righteousness, i.e., to all that
Thou hitherto, by virtue of Thy covenant faithfulness, hast done for
Israel. צדקות means the great deeds done by the Lord for His people,
among which the signs and wonders accompanying their exodus from Egypt
take the first place, so far as therein Jehovah gave proof of the
righteousness of His covenant promise. According to these, may God also
now turn away His anger from His city of Jerusalem! The words in
apposition, "Thy holy mountain," refer especially to the temple
mountain, or Mount Zion, as the centre of the kingdom of God. The prayer
is enforced not only by כּל־צדקריך, but also by the plea that Jerusalem
is the city of God (Thy city). Compare [Psa
79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004.md) and [Psa
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#014.md).

[Dan 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017.md)

In this verse the prayer is repeated in more earnest words. With פּניך
האר (cause Thy face to shine) compare [Psa
80:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#004.md) and [Num
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025.md). אדני למען, because Thou art
Lord, is stronger than למענך. As the Lord κατ ̓ἐχοχήν, God cannot let
the desolation of His sanctuary continue without doing injury to His
honour; cf. [Isa 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md).

[Dan 9:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018.md)

The argument by which the prayer is urged, derived from a reference to
the desolations, is strengthened by the words in apposition: and the
city over which Thy name is named; i.e., not which is named after Thy
name, by which the meaning of this form of expression is enfeebled. The
name of God is the revelation of His being. It is named over Jerusalem
in so far as Jehovah gloriously revealed Himself in it; He has raised
it, by choosing it as the place of His throne in Israel, to the glory of
a city of God; cf. [Psa 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002.md)., and
regarding this form of expression, the remarks under [Deu
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#010.md).

The expression: and laying down my supplication before God (cf. [Dan
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020).md), is derived from the custom of
falling down before God in prayer, and is often met with in Jeremiah;
cf. [Jer 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#026.md); [Jer
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#009.md), and [Jer
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md). The Kethiv פּקחה ([Dan
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018), open.md) is to be preferred to the
Keri פּקח, because it is conformed to the imperative forms in [Dan
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019.md), and is in accordance with the
energy of the prayer. This energy shows itself in the number of words
used in [Dan 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018.md) and [Dan
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019.md). Chr. B. Mich., under [Dan
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019.md), has well remarked: "Fervorem
precantis cognoscere licet cum ex anaphora, seu terna et mysterii plena
nominis Adonai repetitione, tum ex eo, quod singulis hisce imperativis
He paragogicum ad intensiorem adfectum significandum superaddidit, tum
ex congerie illa verborum: Audi, Condona, Attende, reliqua."

[Daniel 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 9:20</span></span>

The granting of the prayer. - While Daniel was yet engaged in prayer (הר
ק על, on account of the holy mountain, i.e., for it, see under [Dan
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#016).md), an answer was already
communicated to him; for the angel Gabriel came to him, and brought to
him an explanation of the seventy years of Jeremiah, i.e., not as to
their expiry, but what would happen after their completion for the city
and the people of God. האישׁ , the man Gabriel, refers, by the use of
the definite article, back to [Dan
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#015.md), where Gabriel appeared to him in
the form of a man. This is expressly observed in the relative clause,
"whom I saw," etc. Regarding בּתּחלּה (at the first, [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021).md) see under [Dan
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001.md). The differently interpreted
words, מעף בּיעף, belong, from their position, to the relative clause,
or specially to ראיתי (I had seen), not to נגע, since no ground can be
perceived for the placing of the adverbial idea before the verb. The
translation of מעף בּיעף by τάχει φερόμενος (lxx), πετόμενος (Theodot.),
cito volans (Vulg.), from which the church fathers concluded that the
angels were winged, notwithstanding the fact that rabbis, as e.g., Jos.
Jacchiades, and modern interpreters (Hv., v. Leng., Hitz.) maintain it,
is without any foundation in the words, and was probably derived by the
old translators from a confounding of יעף with עוּף. יעף means only
wearied, to become tired, to weary oneself by exertion, in certain
places, as e.g., [Jer 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024.md), by a long
journey or course, but nowhere to run or to flee. יעף, weariness -
wearied in weariness, i.e., very wearied or tired. According to this
interpretation, which the words alone admit of, the expression is
applicable, not to the angel, whom as an unearthly being, we cannot
speak of as being wearied, although, with Kranichfeld, one may think of
the way from the dwelling-place of God, removed far from His sinful
people, to this earth as very long. On the contrary, the words perfectly
agree with the condition of Daniel described in [Dan
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md)., 27, and Daniel mentions this
circumstance, because Gabriel, at his former coming to him, not only
helped to strengthen him, but also gave him understanding of the vision,
which was to him hidden in darkness, so that his appearing again at once
awakened joyful hope. אלי נגע, not he touched me, but he reached me,
came forward to me. For this meaning of נגע cf. [Sa2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008.md); [Jon
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006.md). "About the time of the evening
sacrifice." מנחה, properly meat-offering, here comprehending the
sacrifice, as is often its meaning in the later Scriptures; cf. [Mal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013.md); [Mal
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#013.md); [Mal
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#004.md). The time of the evening oblation
was the time of evening prayer for the congregation.

[Daniel 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 9:22</span></span>

ויּבן, he gave understanding, insight, as [Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016.md). The words point back to [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md). First of all Gabriel speaks of
the design and the circumstances of his coming. עתּה יצאתי, now, viz.,
in consequence of thy morning prayer, I am come, sc. from the throne of
God. להשׂכּילך בינה, to instruct thee in knowledge. This is more
particularly declared in [Dan 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023.md). At
the beginning of Daniel's prayer a word, i.e., a communication from God,
came forth, which he brought. דּבר, not a commandment, or the divine
commandment to Gabriel to go to Daniel, but a word of God, and
particularly the word which he announced to Daniel, [Dan
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md). The sentence, "for thou art a
man greatly beloved" (חמוּדות = חמוּדות אישׁ, [Dan
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#011.md), [Dan
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#019.md), vir desideriorum,
desideratissimus), does not contain the reason for Gabriel's coming in
haste, but for the principal thought of the verse, the going forth of
the word of God immediately at the beginning of Daniel's prayer. המּראה
stands not for revelation, but is the vision, the appearance of the
angel by whom the word of God was communicated to the prophet. מראה is
accordingly not the contents of the word spoken, but the form for its
communication to Daniel. To both - the word and the form of its
revelation - Daniel must give heed. This revelation was, moreover, not
communicated to him in a vision, but while in the state of natural
consciousness.

[Daniel 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 9:24</span></span>

The divine revelation regarding the seventy weeks. - This message of the
angel relates to the most important revelations regarding the future
development of the kingdom of God. From the brevity and measured form of
the expression, which Auberlen designates "the lapidary style of the
upper sanctuary," and from the difficulty of calculating the period
named, this verse has been very variously interpreted. The
interpretations may be divided into three principal classes. 1. Most of
the church fathers and the older orthodox interpreters find prophesied
here the appearance of Christ in the flesh, His death, and the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. 2. The majority of the modern
interpreters, on the other hand, refer the whole passage to the time of
Antiochus Epiphanes. 3. Finally, some of the church fathers and several
modern theologians have interpreted the prophecy eschatologically, as an
announcement of the development of the kingdom of God from the end of
the Exile on to the perfecting of the kingdom by the second coming of
Christ at the end of the days.

(Note: The first of these views is in our time fully and at length
defended by Hvernick (Comm.), Hengstenberg (Christol. iii. 1, p. 19ff.,
2nd ed.), and Auberlen (Der Proph. Daniel, u.s.w., p. 103ff., 3rd ed.),
and is adopted also by the Catholic theologian Laur. Reinke (die
messian. Weissag. bei den gr. u. kl. Proph. des A.T. iv. 1, p. 206ff.),
and by Dr. Pusey of England. The second view presents itself in the
Alexandrine translation of the prophecy, more distinctly in Julius
Hilarianus (about a.d. 400) (Chronologia s. libellus de mundi duratione,
in Migne's Biblioth. cler. univ. t. 13, 1098), and in several rabbinical
interpreters, but was first brought into special notice by the
rationalistic interpreters Eichhorn, Bertholdt. v. Leng., Maurer, Ewald,
Hitzig, and the mediating theologians Bleek, Wieseler (Die 70 Wochen u.
die 63 Jahrwochen des Proph. Daniel, Gtt. 1839, with which compare the
Retractation in the Gttinger gel. Anzeigen, 1846, p. 113ff.), who are
followed by Lcke, Hilgenfeld, Kranichfeld, and others. This view has
also been defended by Hofmann (die 70 Jahre des Jer. u. die 70
Jahrwochen des Daniel, Nrnb. 1836, and Weissag. u. Erfllung, as also in
the Schriftbew.), Delitzsch (Art. Daniel in Herz.'s Realenc. Bd. iii.),
and Zndel (in the Kritischen Uterss.), but with this essential
modification, that Hofmann and Delitzsch have united an eschatological
reference with the primary historical reference of [Dan
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) to Antiochus Epiphanes, in
consequence of which the prophecy will be perfectly accomplished only in
the appearance of Antichrist and the final completion of the kingdom of
God at the end of the days. Of the third view we have the first germs in
Hoppolytus and Apollinaris of Laodicea, who, having regard to the
prophecy of Antichrist, [Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md),
refer the statement of [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) of
this chapter, regarding the last week, to the end of the world; and the
first half of this week they regard as the time of the return of Elias,
the second half as the time of Antichrist. This view is for the first
time definitely stated in the Berleburg Bible. But Kliefoth, in his
Comm. on Daniel, was the first who sought to investigate and establish
this opinion exegetically, and Leyrer (in Herz.'s Realenc. xviii. p.
383) has thus briefly stated it: - "The seventy שׁבעים, i.e., the καιροὶ
of Daniel ([Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)..md) measured by
sevens, within which the whole of God's plan of salvation in the world
will be completed, are a symbolical period with reference to the seventy
years of exile prophesied by Jeremiah, and with the accessory notion of
oecumenicity. The 70 is again divided into three periods: into 7 (till
Christ), 62 (till the apostasy of Antichrist), and one שׁבוּע, the last
world - ἑπτά, divided into 2 x 3 1/2 times, the rise and the fall of
Antichrist."

For the history of the interpretation, compare for the patristic period
the treatise of Professor Reusch of Bonn, entitled "Die Patrist.
Berechnung der 70 Jahrwochen Daniels," in the Tb. Theol. Quart. 1868, p.
535ff.; for the period of the middle ages and of more modern times, Abr.
Calovii Εξετασις theologica de septuaginta septimanis Danielis, in the
Biblia illustr. ad Daniel. ix., and Hvernick's History of the
Interpretation in his Comm. p. 386ff.; and for the most recent period,
R. Baxmann on the Book of Daniel in the Theolog. Studien u. Kritiken,
1863, iii. p. 497ff.)

In the great multiplicity of opinions, in order to give clearness to the
interpretation, we shall endeavour first of all to ascertain the meaning
of the words of each clause and verse, and then, after determining
exegetically the import of the words, take into consideration the
historical references and calculations of the periods of time named, and
thus further to establish our view.

The revelation begins, [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), with
a general exhibition of the divine counsel regarding the city and the
people of God; and then there follows, [Dan
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), the further unfolding of the
execution of this counsel in its principal parts. On this all
interpreters are agreed, that the seventy weeks which are determined
upon the people and the city are in [Dan
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) divided into three periods,
and are closely defined according to their duration and their contents.

Seventy weeks are determined. - שׁבעים from שׁבוּע, properly, the time
divided into sevenths, signifies commonly the period of seven days, the
week, as [Gen 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#027). (in the sing..md),
and [Dan 10:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#002.md), in the plur., which
is usually in the form שׁבעות; cf. [Deu
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009.md)., [Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022.md), etc. In the form שׁבעים there
thus lies no intimation that it is not common weeks that are meant. As
little does it lie in the numeral being placed after it, for it also
sometimes is found before it, where, as here, the noun as the weightier
idea must be emphasized, and that not by later authors merely, but also
in [Gen 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#015.md)., [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md); cf. Gesen. Lehrgeb. p. 698. What
period of time is here denoted by שׁבעים can be determined neither from
the word itself and its form, nor from the comparison with ימים שׁבעים,
[Dan 10:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#002.md), since ימים is in these
verses added to שׁבעים, not for the purpose of designating these as
day-weeks, but simply as full weeks (three weeks long). The reasons for
the opinion that common (i.e., seven-day) weeks are not intended, lie
partly in the contents of [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md),
[Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), which undoubtedly teach
that that which came to pass in the sixty-two weeks and in the one week
could not take place in common weeks, partly in the reference of the
seventy שׁבעים to the seventy years of Jeremiah, [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md). According to a prophecy of
Jeremiah - so e.g., Hitzig reasons - Jerusalem must lie desolate for
seventy years, and now, in the sixty-ninth year, the city and the temple
are as yet lying waste ([Dan 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017)..md),
and as yet nowhere are there symptoms of any change. Then, in answer to
his supplication, Daniel received the answer, seventy שׁבעים must pass
before the full working out of the deliverance. "If the deliverance was
not yet in seventy years, then still less was it in seventy weeks. With
seventy times seven months we are also still inside of seventy years,
and we are directed therefore to year-weeks, so that each week shall
consist of seven years. The special account of the contents of the weeks
can be adjusted with the year-weeks alone; and the half-week, [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), particularly appears to be
identical in actual time with these three and a half times (years), [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md)." This latter element is by
others much more definitely affirmed. Thus e.g., Kranichfeld says that
Daniel had no doubt about the definite extent of the expression שׁבוּע,
but gave an altogether unambiguous interpretation of it when he combined
the last half-week essentially with the known and definite three and a
half years of the time of the end. But - we must, on the contrary, ask -
where does Daniel speak of the three and a half years of the time of the
end? He does not use the word year in any of the passages that fall to
be here considered, but only עדּן or מועד, time, definite time. That by
this word common years are to be understood, is indeed taken for granted
by many interpreters, but a satisfactory proof of such a meaning has not
been adduced. Moreover, in favour of year-weeks (periods of seven years)
it has been argued that such an interpretation was very natural, since
they hold so prominent a place in the law of Moses; and the Exile had
brought them anew very distinctly into remembrance, inasmuch as the
seventy years' desolation of the land was viewed as a punishment for the
interrupted festival of the sabbatical years: [Ch2
36:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021) (Hgstb., Kran., and others.md). But
since these periods of seven years, as Hengstenberg himself confesses,
are not called in the law שׁבעים or שׁבעות, therefore, from the repeated
designation of the seventh year as that of the great Sabbath merely
([Lev 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#002.md), [Lev
25:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#004.md); [Lev
26:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md), [Lev
26:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#043.md); [Ch2
36:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021).md), the idea of year-weeks in no
way follows. The law makes mention not only of the Sabbath-year, but
also of periods of seven times seven years, after the expiry of which a
year of jubilee was always to be celebrated ([Lev
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008)..md). These, as well as the
Sabbath-years, might be called שׁבעים. Thus the idea of year-weeks has
no exegetical foundation. Hofmann and Kliefoth are in the right when
they remark that שׁבעים does not necessarily mean year-weeks, but an
intentionally indefinite designation of a period of time measured by the
number seven, whose chronological duration must be determined on other
grounds. The ἁπ. λεγ. חתך means in Chald. to cut off, to cut up into
pieces, then to decide, to determine closely, e.g., Targ. [Est
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#005.md); cf. Buxtorf, Lex. talm., and
Levy, Chald. Wrterb. s.v. The meaning for נחתּך, abbreviatae sunt (Vulg.
for ἐκολοβώθησαν, [Mat 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022).md), which
Wieseler has brought forward, is not proved, and it is unsuitable,
because if one cuts off a piece from a whole, the whole is diminished on
account of the piece cut off, but not the piece itself. For the
explanation of the sing. נחתּך we need neither the supposition that a
definite noun, as עת (time), was before the prophet's mind (Hgstb.), nor
the appeal to the inexact manner of writing of the later authors
(Ewald). The sing. is simply explained by this, that שׁבעים שׁבעים is
conceived of as the absolute idea, and then is taken up by the passive
verb impersonal, to mark that the seventy sevenths are to be viewed as a
whole, as a continued period of seventy seven times following each
other.

Upon thy people and upon thy holy city. In the על there does not lie the
conception of that which is burdensome, or that this period would be a
time of suffering like the seventy years of exile (v. Lengerke). The
word only indicates that such a period of time was determined upon the
people. The people and the city of Daniel are called the people and the
city of God, because Daniel has just represented them before God as His
(Hvernick, v. Lengerke, Kliefoth). But Jerusalem, even when in ruins, is
called the holy city by virtue of its past and its future history; cf.
[Dan 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020.md). This predicate does not
point, as Wieseler and Hitzig have rightly acknowledged, to a time when
the temple stood, as Sthelin and v. Lengerke suppose. Only this lies in
it, Kliefoth has justly added, - not, however, in the predicate of
holiness, but rather in the whole expression, - that the people and city
of God shall not remain in the state of desolation in which they then
were, but shall at some time be again restored, and shall continue
during the time mentioned. One must not, however, at once conclude that
this promise of continuance referred only to the people of the Jews and
their earthly Jerusalem. Certainly it refers first to Israel after the
flesh, and to the geographical Jerusalem, because these were then the
people and the city of God; but these ideas are not exhausted in this
reference, but at the same time embrace the New Testament church and the
church of God on earth.

The following infinitive clauses present the object for which the
seventy weeks are determined, i.e., they intimate what shall happen
till, or with the expiry of, the time determined. Although ל before the
infinitive does not mean till or during, yet it is also not correct to
say that ל can point out only the issue which the period of time finally
reaches, only its result. Whether that which is stated in the infinitive
clauses shall for the first time take place after the expiry of, or at
the end of the time named, or shall develope itself gradually in the
course of it, and only be completed at the end of it, cannot be
concluded from the final ל, but only from the material contents of the
final clauses. The six statements are divided by Maurer, Hitzig,
Kranichfeld, and others into three passages of two members each, thus:
After the expiry of seventy weeks, there shall (1) be completed the
measure of sin; (2) the sin shall be covered and righteousness brought
in; (3) the prophecy shall be fulfilled, and the temple, which was
desecrated by Antiochus, shall be again consecrated. The masoretes seem,
however, to have already conceived of this threefold division by placing
the Atnach under עלמים צדק (the fourth clause); but it rests on a false
construction of the individual members especially of the first two
passages. Rather we have two three-membered sentences before us. This
appears evident from the arrangement of the six statements; i.e., that
the first three statements treat of the taking away of sin, and thus of
the negative side of the deliverance; the three last treat of the
bringing in of everlasting righteousness with its consequences, and thus
of the positive deliverance, and in such a manner that in both classes
the three members stand in reciprocal relation to each other: the fourth
statement corresponds to the first, the fifth to the second, the sixth
to the third - the second and the fifth present even the same verb חתם.

In the first and second statements the reading is doubtful. Instead of
לחתּם (Keth.), to seal, the Keri has להתם, to end (R. תּמם, to
complete). In לכלּא a double reading is combined, for the vowel-points
do not belong to the Keth., which rather has לכלא, since כּלא is nowhere
found in the Piel, but to the Keri, for the Masoretes hold כלא to be of
the same meaning as כלה, to be ended. Thus the ancient translators
interpreted it: lxx, τὰς ἀδικίας σπανίσαι; Theod., συντελεσθῆναι, al.
συντελέσαι; Aquil., συντελέσαι τὴν ἀθεσίαν; Vulg., ut consummetur
praevaricatio. Bertholdt, Rosenmller, Gesenius, Winer, Ewald, Hitzig,
Maurer, have followed them in supposing a passing of הinto .א But since
כּלה occurs frequently in Daniel, always with ה htiw(cf. v. 27; [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md); [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007).md), and generally the roots with
הtake the form of those with אmuch seldomer than the reverse, on these
grounds the reading לכלא thus deserves the preference, apart from the
consideration that almost all the Keris are valueless emendations of the
Masoretes; and the parallel להתם, decidedly erroneous, is obviously
derived from [Dan 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023.md). Thus the Keri
does not give in the two passages a suitable meaning. The explanation:
to finish the transgression and to make full the measure of sin, does
not accord with what follows: to pardon the iniquity; and the thought
that the Jews would fill up the measure of their transgression in the
seventy year-weeks, and that as a punishment they would pass through a
period of suffering from Antiochus and afterwards be pardoned, is
untenable, because the punishment by Antiochus for their sins brought to
their full measure is arbitrarily interpolated; but without this
interpolation the pardon of the sins stands in contradiction to the
filling up of their measure. Besides, this explanation is further
opposed by the fact, that in the first two statements there must be a
different subject from that which is in the third. For to fill up the
measure of sin is the work of God. Accordingly the Kethiv alone is to be
adopted as correct, and the first passage to be translated thus: to shut
up the transgression. כּלא means to hold back, to hold in, to arrest, to
hold in prison, to shut in or shut up; henceכּלא, a prison, jail. To
arrest the wickedness or shut it up does not mean to pardon it, but to
hem it in, to hinder it so that it can no longer spread about (Hofm.);
cf. [Zac 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008.md) and [Rev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#003.md).

In the second passage, "to seal up sin," the חטּאות are the several
proofs of the transgression. חתם, to seal, does not denote the finishing
or ending of the sins (Theodrt. and others). Like the Arab. chtm, it may
occur in the sense of "to end," and this meaning may have originated
from the circumstance that one is wont at the end of a letter or
document to affix the impress of a seal; yet this meaning is nowhere
found in Hebr.: see under [Exo 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#012.md).
The figure of the sealing stands here in connection with the shutting up
in prison. Cf. [Dan 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#018.md), the king for
greater security sealed up the den into which Daniel was cast. Thus also
God seals the hand of man that it cannot move, [Job
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#007.md), and the stars that they cannot
give light, [Job 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#007.md). But in this
figure to seal is not = to take away, according to which Hgstb. and many
others explain it thus: the sins are here described as sealed, because
they are altogether removed out of the sight of God, altogether set
aside; for "that which is shut up and sealed is not merely taken away,
entirely set aside, but guarded, held under lock and seal" (Kliefoth).
Hence more correctly Hofmann and Kliefoth say, "If the sins are sealed,
they are on the one side laid under custody, so that they cannot any
more be active or increase, but that they may thus be guarded and held,
so that they can no longer be pardoned and blotted out;" cf. [Rev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#003.md).

The third statement is, "to make reconciliation for iniquity." כּפּר is
terminus techn., to pardon, to blot out by means of a sin-offering,
i.e., to forgive.

These three passages thus treat of the setting aside of sin and its
blotting out; but they neither form a climax nor a mere συναθροισμός, a
multiplying of synonymous expressions for the pardoning of sins, ut tota
peccatorum humani generis colluvies eo melius comprehenderetur (M.
Geier). Against the idea of a climax it is justly objected, that in that
case the strongest designation of sin, הפּשׁע, which designates sin as a
falling away from God, a rebelling against Him, should stand last,
whereas it occurs in the first sentence. Against the idea of a
συναθροισμός it is objected, that the words "to shut up" and "to seal"
are not synonymous with "to make reconciliation for," i.e., "to
forgive." The three expressions, it is true, all treat alike of the
setting aside of sin, but in different ways. The first presents the
general thought, that the falling away shall be shut up, the progress
and the spreading of the sin shall be prevented. The other two
expressions define more closely how the source whence arises the
apostasy shall be shut up, the going forth and the continued operation
of the sin prevented. This happens in one way with unbelievers, and in a
different way with believers. The sins of unbelievers are sealed, are
guarded securely under a seal, so that they may no more spread about and
increase, nor any longer be active and operative; but the sins of
believers are forgiven through a reconciliation. The former idea is
stated in the second member, and the latter in the third, as Hofmann and
Kliefoth have rightly remarked.

There follows the second group of three statements, which treat of the
positive unfolding of salvation accompanying the taking away and the
setting aside of sin. The first expression of this group, or the fourth
in the whole number, is "to bring in everlasting righteousness." After
the entire setting aside of sin must come a righteousness which shall
never cease. That צדק does not mean "happiness of the olden time"
(Bertholdt, Rsch), nor "innocence of the former better times" (J. D.
Michaelis), but "righteousness," requires at present no further proof.
Righteousness comes from heaven as the gift of God (Ps. 85:11-14; [Isa
51:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005).md), rises as a sun upon them that
fear God (Mal. 3:20), and is here called everlasting, corresponding to
the eternity of the Messianic kingdom (cf. [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md); [Dan
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018.md), [Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027).md). צדק comprehends the internal
and the external righteousness of the new heavens and the new earth,
[Pe2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md). This fourth expression
forms the positive supplement of the first: in the place of the
absolutely removed transgression is the perfected righteousness.

In the fifth passage, to seal up the vision and prophecy, the word חתם,
used in the second passage of sin, is here used of righteousness. The
figure of sealing is regarded by many interpreters in the sense of
confirming, and that by filling up, with reference to the custom of
impressing a seal on a writing for the confirmation of its contents; and
in illustration these references are given: [Kg1
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008.md), and [Jer
32:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010.md), [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044.md) (Hvernick, v. Lengerke, Ewald,
Hitzig, and others). But for this figurative use of the word to seal, no
proof-passages are adduced from the O.T. Add to this that the word
cannot be used here in a different sense from that in which it is used
in the second passage. The sealing of the prophecy corresponds to the
sealing of the transgression, and must be similarly understood. The
prophecy is sealed when it is laid under a seal, so that it can no
longer actively show itself.

The interpretation of the object ונביא חזון is also disputed. Berth.,
Ros., Bleek, Ewald, Hitzig, Wieseler, refer it to the prophecy of the
seventy weeks (Jer 25 and 29), mentioned in [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md). But against this view stands the
fact of the absence of the article; for if by חזון that prophecy is
intended, an intimation of this would have been expected at least by the
definite article, and here particularly would have been altogether
indispensable. It is also condemned by the word נביא added, which shows
that both words are used in comprehensive generality for all existing
prophecies and prophets. Not only the prophecy, but the prophet who
gives it, i.e., not merely the prophecy, but also the calling of the
prophet, must be sealed. Prophecies and prophets are sealed, when by the
full realization of all prophecies prophecy ceases, no prophets any more
appear. The extinction of prophecy in consequence of its fulfilment is
not, however (with Hengstenberg), to be sought in the time of the
manifestation of Christ in the flesh; for then only the prophecy of the
Old Covenant reached its end (cf. [Mat
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#013.md); [Luk
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#037.md); [Joh
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046).md), and its place is occupied by
the prophecy of the N.T., the fulfilling of which is still in the
future, and which will not come to an end and terminate (καταργηθήσεται,
[Co1 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008).md) till the kingdom of God is
perfected in glory at the termination of the present course of the
world's history, at the same time with the full conclusive fulfilment of
the O.T. prophecy; cf. [Act 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021.md). This
fifth member stands over against the second, as the fourth does over
against the first. "When the sins are sealed, the prophecy is also
sealed, for prophecy is needed in the war against sin; when sin is thus
so placed that it can no longer operate, then prophecy also may come to
a state of rest; when sin comes to an end in its place, prophecy can
come to an end also by its fulfilment, there being no place for it after
the setting aside of sin. And when the apostasy is shut up, so that it
can no more spread about, then righteousness will be brought, that it
may possess the earth, now freed from sin, shut up in its own place"
(Kliefoth).

The sixth and last clause, to anoint a most holy, is very differently
interpreted. Those interpreters who seek the fulfilment of this word of
revelation in the time following nearest the close of the Exile, or in
the time of the Maccabees, refer this clause either to the consecration
of the altar of burnt-offering (Wieseler), which was restored by
Zerubbabel and Joshua ([Ezr 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002)..md), or
to the consecration of the temple of Zerubbabel (J. D. Michaelis, Jahn,
Steudel), or to the consecration of the altar of burnt-offering which
was desecrated by Antiochus Epiphanes, 1 Macc. 4:54 (Hitzig,
Kranichfeld, and others). But none of these interpretations can be
justified. It is opposed by the actual fact, that neither in the
consecration of Zerubbabel's temple, nor at the re-consecration of the
altar of burnt-offering desecrated by Antiochus, is mention made of any
anointing. According to the definite, uniform tradition of the Jews, the
holy anointing oil did not exist during the time of the second temple.
Only the Mosaic sanctuary of the tabernacle, with its altars and
vessels, were consecrated by anointing. [Exo
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022.md)., 40:1-16; [Lev
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010.md). There is no mention of anointing
even at the consecration of Solomon's temple, 1 Kings 8 and 2 Chron 5-7,
because that temple only raised the tabernacle to a fixed dwelling, and
the ark of the covenant as the throne of God, which was the most holy
furniture thereof, was brought from the tabernacle to the temple. Even
the altar of burnt-offering of the new temple ([Eze
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#020.md),[Eze
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#026).md) was not consecrated by
anointing, but only by the offering of blood. Then the special fact of
the consecration of the altar of burnt-offering, or of the temple, does
not accord with the general expressions of the other members of this
verse, and was on the whole not so significant and important an event as
that one might expect it to be noticed after the foregoing expressions.
What Kranichfeld says in confirmation of this interpretation is very
far-fetched and weak. He remarks, that "as in this verse the prophetic
statements relate to a taking away and כּפּר of sins, in the place of
which righteousness is restored, accordingly the anointing will also
stand in relation to this sacred action of the כפר, which primarily and
above all conducts to the significance of the altar of Israel, that,
viz., which stood in the outer court." But, even granting this to be
correct, it proves nothing as to the anointing even of the altar of
burnt-offering. For the preceding clauses speak not only of the כפר of
transgression, but also of the taking away (closing and sealing) of the
apostasy and of sin, and thus of a setting aside of sin, which did not
take place by means of a sacrifice. The fullest expiation also for the
sins of Israel which the O.T. knew, viz., that on the great day of
atonement, was not made on the altar of burnt-offering, but by the
sprinkling of the blood of the offering on the ark of the covenant in
the holy of holies, and on the altar of incense in the most holy place.
If משׁח is to be explained later the כּפּר, then by "holy of holies" we
would have to understand not "primarily" the altar of burnt-offering,
but above all the holy vessels of the inner sanctuary, because here it
is not an atonement needing to be repeated that is spoken of, but one
that avails for ever.

In addition to this, there is the verbal argument that the words קדשׁים
קדשׁ are not used of a single holy vessel which alone could be thought
of. Not only the altar of burnt-offering is so named, [Exo
29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037.md); [Exo
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#010.md), but also the altar of incense,
[Exo 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010.md), and the two altars with
all the vessels of the sanctuary, the ark of the covenant, shew-bread,
candlesticks, basins, and the other vessels belonging thereto, [Exo
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#029.md), also the holy material for
incense, [Exo 30:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#036.md), the shew-bread,
[Lev 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#009.md), the meat-offering, [Lev
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md), [Lev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#010.md); [Lev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#010.md); [Lev
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md), the flesh of the sin-offering
and of the expiatory sacrifice, [Lev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#010.md),[Lev
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#018.md); [Lev
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017.md); [Lev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md), [Lev
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006.md); [Lev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#013.md); [Num
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#009.md), and that which was sanctified to
the Lord, [Lev 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028.md). Finally, the
whole surroundings of the hill on which the temple stood, [Eze
43:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#012.md), and the whole new temple, [Eze
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#003.md), is named a "most holy;" and
according to [Ch1 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#013.md), Aaron and his
sons are sanctified as קדשׁים קדשׁ.

Thus there is no good ground for referring this expression to the
consecration of the altar of burnt-offering. Such a reference is wholly
excluded by the fact that the consecration of Zerubbabel's temple and
altar, as well as of that which was desecrated by Antiochus, was a work
of man, while the anointing of a "most holy" in the verse before us must
be regarded as a divine act, because the three preceding expressions
beyond controversy announce divine actions. Every anointing, indeed, of
persons or of things was performed by men, but it becomes a work of God
when it is performed with the divinely ordained holy anointing oil by
priests or prophets according to God's command, and then it is the means
and the symbol of the endowment of equipment with the Spirit of God.
When Saul was anointed by Samuel, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him,
[Sa1 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#009.md). The same thing was denoted
by the anointing of David, [Sa1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md).
The anointing also of the tabernacle and its vessels served the same
object, consecrating them as the place and the means of carrying on the
gracious operations of the Spirit of God. As an evidence of this, the
glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle after it was set up and
consecrated. At the dedication of the sanctuary after the Exile, under
Zerubbabel and in the Maccabean age, the anointing was wanting, and
there was no entrance into it also of the glory of the Lord. Therefore
these consecrations cannot be designated as anointings and as the works
of God, and the angel cannot mean these works of men by the "anointing
of a most holy."

Much older, more general, and also nearer the truth, is the explanation
which refers these words to the anointing of the Messiah, an explanation
which is established by various arguments. The translation of the lxx,
καὶ εὐφράναι ἅγιον ἁγίων, and of Theod., τοῦ χρῖσαι ἅγιον ἁγίων, the
meaning of which is controverted, is generally understood by the church
Fathers as referring to the Messiah. Theodoret sets it forth as
undoubtedly correct, and as accepted even by the Jews; and the old
Syriac translator has introduced into the text the words, "till the
Messiah, the Most Holy."

(Note: Eusebius, Demonstr. Ev. viii. 2, p. 387, ed. Colon., opposes the
opinion that the translation of Aquila, καὶ ἀλεῖψαι ἡγιασμένον
ἡγιασμένων, may be understood of the Jewish high priest. Cf. Raymundis
Martini, Pugio fidei, p. 285, ed. Carpz., and Edzard ad Abodah Sara, p.
246f., for evidences of the diffusion of this interpretation among the
Jews.)

But this interpretation is set aside by the absence of the article.
Without taking into view [Ch1 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#013.md),
the words קדשׁים קדשׁ are nowhere used of persons, but only of things.
This meaning lies at the foundation of the passage in the book of
Chronicles referred to, "that he should sanctify a קדשׁים קדשׁ קד,
anoint him (Aaron) to be a most holy thing." Following Hvernick,
therefore, Hengstenberg (2nd ed. of his Christol. iii. p. 54) seeks to
make this meaning applicable also for the Messianic interpretation, for
he thinks that Christ is here designated as a most holy thing. But
neither in the fact that the high priest bore on his brow the
inscription ליהוה קדשׁ, nor in the declaration regarding Jehovah, "He
shall be למקדּשׁ," [Isa 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md), cf. [Eze
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016.md), is there any ground for the
conclusion that the Messiah could simply be designated as a most holy
thing. In [Luk 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md) Christ is spoken
of by the simple neuter ἅγιον, but not by the word "object;" and the
passages in which Jesus is described as ὁ ἅγιος, [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md); [Act
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#030.md); [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md); [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md), prove nothing whatever as to this
use of קדשׁ of Christ. Nothing to the purpose also can be gathered from
the connection of the sentence. If in what follows the person of the
Messiah comes forward to view, it cannot be thence concluded that He
must also be mentioned in this verse.

Much more satisfactory is the thought, that in the words "to anoint a
קדשׁים קדשׁ" the reference is to the anointing of a new sanctuary,
temple, or most holy place. The absence of the article forbids us,
indeed, from thinking of the most holy place of the earthly temple which
was rebuilt by Zerubbabel, since the most holy place of the tabernacle
as well as of the temple is constantly called הקדשׁים קדשׁ. But it is
not this definite holy of holies that is intended, but a new holy of
holies which should be in the place of the holy of holies of the
tabernacle and the temple of Solomon. Now, since the new temple of the
future seen by Ezekiel, with all its surroundings, is called ([Eze
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#003).md) קדשׁים קדשׁ, Hofmann (de 70
Jahre, p. 65) thinks that the holy of holies is the whole temple, and
its anointing with oil a figure of the sanctification of the church by
the Holy Ghost, but that this shall not be in the conspicuousness in
which it is here represented till the time of the end, when the
perfected church shall possess the conspicuousness of a visible
sanctuary. But, on the contrary, Kliefoth (p. 307) has with perfect
justice replied, that "the most holy, and the temple, so far as it has a
most holy place, is not the place of the congregation where it comes to
God and is with God, but, on the contrary, is the place where God is
present for the congregation, and manifests Himself to it." The words
under examination say nothing of the people and the congregation which
God will gather around the place of His gracious presence, but of the
objective place where God seeks to dwell among His people and reveal
Himself to them. The anointing is the act by which the place is
consecrated to be a holy place of the gracious presence and revelation
of God. If thus the anointing of a most holy is here announced, then by
it there is given the promise, not of the renewal of the place already
existing from of old, but of the appointment of a new place of God's
gracious presence among His people, a new sanctuary. This, as Kliefoth
further justly observes, apart from the connection, might refer to the
work of redemption perfected by the coming of Christ, which has indeed
created in him a new place of the gracious presence of God, a new way of
God's dwelling among men. But since this statement is closely connected
with those going before, and they speak of the perfect setting aside of
transgression and of sin, of the appearance of everlasting
righteousness, and the shutting up of all prophecy by its fulfilment,
thus of things for which the work of redemption completed by the first
appearance of Christ has, it is true, laid the everlasting foundation,
but which first reach their completion in the full carrying through of
this work of salvation in the return of the Lord by the final judgment,
and the establishment of the kingdom of glory under the new heavens and
on the new earth, - since this is the case, we must refer this sixth
statement also to that time of the consummation, and understand it of
the establishment of the new holy of holies which was shown to the holy
seer on Patmos as ἡ σκηνὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ μετὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, in which God will
dwell with them, and they shall become His people, and He shall be their
God with them ([Rev 21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001).md). In this
holy city there will be no temple, for the Lord, the Almighty God, and
the Lamb is its temple, and the glory of God will lighten it ([Rev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022).md). Into it nothing shall enter
that defileth or worketh abomination ([Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027).md), for sin shall then be closed
and sealed up; there shall righteousness dwell ([Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013).md), and prophecy shall cease ([Co1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008).md) by its fulfilment.

From the contents of these six statements it thus appears that the
termination of the seventy weeks coincides with the end of the present
course of the world. But [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)
says nothing as to the commencement of this period. Nor can this be
determined, as many interpreters think, from the relation in which the
revelation of the seventy weeks stands to the prayer of Daniel,
occasioned by Jeremiah's prophecy of the seventy years of the desolation
of Jerusalem. If Daniel, in the sixty-ninth year of the desolation, made
supplication to the Lord for mercy in behalf of Jerusalem and Israel,
and on the occasion of this prayer God caused Gabriel to lay open to him
that seventy weeks were determined upon the city and the people of God,
it by no means thence follows that seventy year-weeks must be
substituted in place of the seventy years prophesied of, that both
commence simultaneously, and thus that the seventy years of the Exile
shall be prolonged to a period of oppression for Israel lasting for
seventy year-weeks. Such a supposition is warranted neither by the
contents of the prophecy of Jeremiah, nor by the message of the angel to
Daniel. Jeremiah, it is true, prophesied not merely of seventy years of
the desolation of Jerusalem and Judah, but also of the judgment upon
Babylon after the expiry of these years, and the collecting together and
bringing back of Israel from all the countries whither they were
scattered into their own land ([Jer
25:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md); [Jer
29:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md); but in his supplication
Daniel had in his eye only the desolation of the land of Jeremiah's
prophecy, and prayed for the turning away of the divine anger from
Jerusalem, and for the pardon of Israel's sins. Now if the words of the
angel had been, "not seventy years, but seventy year-weeks, are
determined over Israel," this would have been no answer to Daniel's
supplication, at least no comforting answer, to bring which to him the
angel was commanded to go forth in haste. Then the angel announces in
[Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md) much more than the return of
Israel from the Exile to their own land. But this is decided by the
contents of the following verses, in which the space of seventy weeks is
divided into three periods, and at the same time the commencement of the
period is determined in a way which excludes its connection with the
beginning of the seventy years of the Exile.

[Daniel 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 9:25</span></span>

The detailed statement of the 70 שׁבעים in 7 + 62 + 1 ([Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md), with the fuller description of
that which was to happen in the course of these three periods of time,
incontrovertibly shows that these three verses are a further explication
of the contents of [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md). This
explication is introduced by the words: "Know therefore, and
understand," which do not announce a new prophecy, as Wieseler and
Hofmann suppose, but only point to the importance of the further opening
up of the contents of [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), since
ותשׂכּל (and thou wilt understand) stands in distinct relation to בינה
להשׂכּלך (to give thee skill and understanding, [Dan
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#022).md). The two parts of [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) contain the statements regarding
the first two portions of the whole period, the seven and the sixty-two
שׁבעים, and are rightly separated by the Masoretes by placing the Atnach
under שׁבעה. The first statement is: "from the going forth of the
command to restore and to build Jerusalem unto a Messiah (Gesalbten), a
prince, shall be seven weeks." דּבר מצא (from the going forth of the
commandment) formally corresponds, indeed, to דּבר יצא (the commandment
came forth), [Dan 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023.md), emphatically
expressing a decision on the part of God, but the two expressions are
not actually to be identified; for the commandment, [Dan
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023.md), is the divine revelation
communicated in [Dan 9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), which
the angel brings to Daniel; the commandment in [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) is, on the contrary, more fully
determined by the words, "to restore and to build, etc. להשׁיב is not to
be joined adverbially with ולבנות so as to form one idea: to build
again; for, though שׁוּב may be thus used adverbially in Kal, yet the
Hiphil השׁיב is not so used. השׁיב means to lead back, to bring again,
then to restore; cf. for this last meaning [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md), [Psa
80:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#004.md), [Psa
80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md),20. The object to להשׁיב follows
immediately after the word ולבנות, namely, Jerusalem. The supplementing
of עם, people (Wieseler, Kliefoth, and others), is arbitrary, and is not
warranted by [Jer 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md). To bring
back, to restore a city, means to raise it to its former state; denotes
the restitutio, but not necessarily the full restitutio in integrum
(against Hengstenberg). Here לבנות is added, as in the second half of
the verse to תּשׁוּב, yet not so as to make one idea with it, restoring
to build, or building to restore, i.e., to build up again to the old
extent. בּנה as distinguished from השׁיב denotes the building after
restoring, and includes the constant preservation in good building
condition, as well as the carrying forward of the edifice beyond its
former state.

But if we ask when this commandment went forth, in order that we may
thereby determine the beginning of the seven weeks, and, since they form
the first period of the seventy, at the same time determine the
beginning of the seventy weeks, the words and the context only supply
this much, that by the "commandment" is meant neither the word of God
which is mentioned in [Dan 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023.md),
because it says nothing about the restoration of Jerusalem, but speaks
only of the whole message of the angel. Nor yet is it the word of God
which is mentioned in [Dan 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md), the
prophecies given in Jer 25 and 29, as Hitzig, Kranichfeld, and others
suppose. For although from these prophecies it conclusively follows,
that after the expiry of the seventy years with the return of Israel
into their own land, Jerusalem shall again be built up, yet they do not
speak of that which shall happen after the seventy years, but only of
that which shall happen within that period, namely, that Jerusalem shall
for so long a time lie desolate, as [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md) expressly affirms. The prophecy of
the seventy years' duration of the desolation of Jerusalem ([Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002).md) cannot possibly be regarded as
the commandment (in [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025).md) to
restore Jerusalem (Kliefoth). As little can we, with Hitzig, think on
Jer 30 and 31, because this prophecy contains nothing whatever of a
period of time, and in this verse before us there is no reference to
this prophecy. The restoration of Israel and of Jerusalem has indeed
been prophesied of in general, not merely by Jeremiah, but also long
before him by Isaiah (Daniel 40-56). With as much justice may we think
on Isa 40ff. as on Jer 30 and 31; but all such references are excluded
by this fact, that the angel names the commandment for the restoration
of Jerusalem as the terminus a quo for the seventy weeks, and thus could
mean only a word of God whose going forth was somewhere determined, or
could be determined, just as the appearance of the נגיד משׁיח is named
as the termination of the seven weeks. Accordingly "the going forth of
the commandment to restore," etc., must be a factum coming into
visibility, the time of which could without difficulty be known - a word
from God regarding the restoration of Jerusalem which went forth by
means of a man at a definite time, and received an observable historical
execution.

Now, with Calvin, Oecolampadius, Kleinert, Ngelsbach, Ebrard, and
Kliefoth, we can think of nothing more appropriate than the edict of
Cyrus ([Ezr 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md) which permitted
the Jews to return, from which the termination of the Exile is
constantly dated, and from the time off which this return, together with
the building up of Jerusalem, began, and was carried forward, though
slowly (Klief.). The prophecy of [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md), that God would by means of
Cyrus speak to cause Jerusalem to be built, and the foundation of the
temple to be laid, directs us to this edict. With reference to this
prophecy, it is said in [Ezr 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014.md),
"They builded according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and
according to the commandment of the king of Persia." This is
acknowledged even by Hengstenberg, who yet opposes this reference; for
he remarks (Christol. iii. p. 142), "If the statement were merely of the
commencement of the building, then they would undoubtedly be justified
who place the starting-point in the first year of Cyrus. Isaiah ([Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013).md) commends Cyrus as the builder
of the city; and all the sacred writings which relate to the period from
the time of Cyrus to Nehemiah distinctly state the actual existence of a
Jerusalem during this period." But according to his explanation, the
words of the angel do not announce the beginning of the building of the
city, but much rather the beginning of its "completed restoration
according to its ancient extent and its ancient glory." But that this is
not contained in the words ולבנות להשׁיב we have already remarked, to
which is to be added, that the placing in opposition the commencement of
the building and the commencement of its completed restoration is quite
arbitrary and vain, since certainly the commencement of the restoration
at the same time includes in it the commencement of the completed
restoration. In favour of interpreting להשׁיב of the completed
restoration, Hengstenberg remarks that "in the announcement the temple
is named along with the city in [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) as well as in [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md). That with the announcement of
the building the temple is not named here, that mention is made only of
the building of the streets of the city, presupposes the sanctuary as
already built up at the commencement of the building which is here
spoken of; and the existence of the temple again requires that a
commencement of the rebuilding of the city had also been already made,
since it is not probable that the angel should have omitted just that
which was the weightiest matter, that for which Daniel was most grieved,
and about which he had prayed (cf. [Dan
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017.md), [Dan
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020).md) with the greatest solicitude."
But the validity of this conclusion is not obvious. In [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) the naming of the temple along
with the city is required by the facts of the case, and this verse
treats of what shall happen after the sixty-two weeks. How, then, shall
it be thence inferred that the temple should also be mentioned along
with the city in [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), where the
subject is that which forms the beginning of the seven or of the seventy
weeks, and that, since this was not done, the temple must have been then
already built? The non-mention of the temple in [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), as in [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), is fully and simply explained by
this, that the word of the angel stands in definite relation to the
prayer of Daniel, but that Daniel was moved by Jeremiah's prophecy of
the seventy years' duration of the חרבות of Jerusalem to pray for the
turning away of the divine wrath from the city. As Jeremiah, in the
announcement of the seventy years' desolation of the land, did not
specially mention the destruction of the temple, so also the angel, in
the decree regarding the seventy weeks which are determined upon the
people of Israel and the holy city, makes no special mention of the
temple; as, however, in Jeremiah's prophecy regarding the desolation of
the land, the destruction not only of Jerusalem, but also of the temple,
is included, so also in the building of the holy city is included that
of the temple, by which Jerusalem was made a holy city. Although thus
the angel, in the passage before us, does not expressly speak of the
building of the temple, but only of the holy city, we can maintain the
reference of the דּבר מצא to the edict of Cyrus, which constituted an
epoch in the history of Israel, and consider this edict as the beginning
of the termination of the seven resp. seventy weeks.

The words נגיד משׁיח עד show the termination of the seven weeks. The
words נגיד משׁיח are not to be translated an anointed prince
(Bertholdt); for משׁיח cannot be an adjective to נגיד, because in Hebr.
The adjective is always placed after the substantive, with few
exceptions, which are inapplicable to this case; cf. Ewald's Lehrb.
293b. Nor can משׁיח be a participle: till a prince is anointed
(Steudel), but it is a noun, and נגיד is connected with it by
apposition: an anointed one, who at the same time is a prince. According
to the O.T., kings and priests, and only these, were anointed. Since,
then, משׁיח is brought forward as the principal designation, we may not
by נגיד think of a priest-prince, but only of a prince of the people,
nor by משׁיח of a king, but only of a priest; and by נגיד משׁיח we must
understand a person who first and specially is a priest, and in addition
is a prince of the people, a king. The separation of the two words in
[Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), where נגיד is acknowledged
as meaning a prince of the people, leads to the same conclusion. This
priest-king can neither be Zerubbabel (according to many old
interpreters), nor Ezra (Steudel), nor Onias III (Wieseler); for
Zerubbabel the prince was not anointed, and the priest Ezra and the high
priest Onias were not princes of the people. Nor can Cyrus be meant
here, as Saad., Gaon., Bertholdt, v. Lengerke, Maurer, Ewald, Hitzig,
Kranichfeld, and others think, by a reference to [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md); for, supposing it to be the case
that Daniel had reason from [Isa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md)
to call Cyrus משׁיח - which is to be doubted, since from this epithet
משׁיחו, His (Jehovah's) anointed, which Isaiah uses of Cyrus, it does
not follow as of course that he should be named משׁיח - the title ought
at least to have been משׁיח נגיד, the משׁיח being an adjective following
נגיד, because there is no evident reason for the express precedence of
the adjectival definition.

(Note: "It is an unjustifiable assertion that every heathen king may
also bear the name משׁיח, anointed. In all the books of the O.T. There
is but a single heathen king, Cyrus, who is named משׁיח ([Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md), and he not simply as such, but
because of the remarkable and altogether singular relation in which he
stood to the church, because of the gifts with which God endowed him for
her deliverance, ... and because of the typical relation in which he
stood to the author of the higher deliverance, the Messiah. Cyrus could
in a certain measure be regarded as a theocratic ruler, and as such he
is described by Isaiah." - Hengstenberg.)

The O.T. knows only One who shall be both priest and king in one person
([Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md); [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013).md), Christ, the Messias ([Joh
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#025).md), whom, with Hvernick,
Hengstenberg, Hofmann, Auberlen, Delitzsch, and Kliefoth, we here
understand by the נגיד משׁיח, because in Him the two essential
requisites of the theocratic king, the anointing and the appointment to
be the נגיד of the people of God (cf. [Sa1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001.md); [Sa1
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014.md); [Sa1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md); [Sa1
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#030.md); [Sa2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004.md); [Sa2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002)..md), are found in the most perfect
manner. These requisites are here attributed to Him as predicates, and
in such a manner that the being anointed goes before the being a prince,
in order to make prominent the spiritual, priestly character of His
royalty, and to designate Him, on the ground of the prophecies, [Isa
61:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md) and [Isa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md), as the person by whom "the sure
mercies of David" ([Isa 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003).md) shall be
realized by the covenant people.

(Note: In the נגיד משׁיח it is natural to suppose there is a reference
to the passages in Isaiah referred to; yet one must not, with Hofmann
and Auberlen, hence conclude that Christ is as King of Israel named
משׁיח, and as King of the heathen נגיד, for in the frequent use of the
word נגיד of the king of Israel in the books of Samuel it is much more
natural to regard it as the reference to David.)

The absence of the definite article is not to be explained by saying
that משׁיח, somewhat as צמח, [Zac 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md);
[Zac 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012.md), is used κατ ̓ἑχ. as a nomen
propr. of the Messiah, the Anointed; for in this case נגיד ought to have
the article, since in Hebrew we cannot say מלך דּוד, but only המּלך
דּוד. Much rather the article is wanting, because it shall not be said:
till the Messiah, who is prince, but only: till one comes who is
anointed and at the same time prince, because He that is to come is not
definitely designated as the expected Messiah, but must be made
prominent by the predicates ascribed to Him only as a personage
altogether singular.

Thus the first half of [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md)
states that the first seven of the seventy weeks begin with the edict
(of Cyrus) permitting the return of Israel from exile and the
restoration of Jerusalem, and extend from that time till the appearance
of an anointed one who at the same time is prince, i.e., till Christ.
With that view the supposition that שׁבעים are year-weeks, periods of
seven years, is irreconcilable. Therefore most interpreters who
understand Christ as the נגיד משׁיח, have referred the following number,
and sixty-two weeks, to the first clause - "from the going forth of the
command ... seven weeks and sixty-two weeks." Thus Theodotion: ἕως
Χριστοῦ ἡγουμένου ἑβδομάδες ἑπτὰ καὶ ἑβδομάδες ἑξηκονταδύο; and the
Vulgate: usque ad Christum ducem hebdomades septem et hebdomades
sexaginta duae erunt. The text of the lxx is here, however, completely
in error, and is useless. This interpretation, in recent times,
Hvernick, Hengstenberg, and Auberlen have sought to justify in different
ways, but without having succeeded in invalidating the reasons which
stand opposite to them. First of all the Atnach forbids this
interpretation, for by it the seven שׁבעים are separated from the
sixty-two. This circumstance, however, in and of itself decides nothing,
since the Atnach does not always separate clauses, but frequently also
shows only the point of rest within a clause; besides, it first was
adopted by the Masoretes, and only shows the interpretation of these
men, without at all furnishing any guarantee for its correctness. But
yet this view is not to be overlooked, as Hgstb. himself acknowledges in
the remark: "Here the separation of the two periods of time was of great
consequence, in order to show that the seven and the sixty-two weeks are
not a mere arbitrary dividing into two of one whole period, but that to
each of these two periods its own characteristic mark belongs." With
this remark, Hvernick's assertion, that the dividing of the sixty-nine
שׁבעים into seven and sixty-two is made only on account of the solemnity
of the whole passage, is set aside as altogether vain, and the question
as to the ground of the division presses itself on our earnest
attention.

If this division must indicate that to each of the two periods its own
distinctive characteristic belongs, an unprejudiced consideration of the
words shows that the characteristic mark of the "seven weeks" lies in
this, that this period extends from the going forth of the word to
restore Jerusalem till the appearance of an Anointed one, a Prince, thus
terminating with the appearance of this Prince, and that the
characteristic mark for the "sixty-two weeks" consists in that which the
words immediately connected therewith affirm, וגו ונבנתה תּשׁוּב, and
thus that the "sixty-two weeks" belong indeed to the following clause.
But according to Hengstenberg the words ought not to be so understood,
but thus: "sixty-nine weeks must pass away, seven till the completed
restoration of the city, sixty-two from that time till the Anointed, the
Prince." But it is clearly impossible to find this meaning in the words
of the text, and it is quite superfluous to use any further words in
proof of this.

(Note: Hengstenberg, as Kliefoth has remarked, has taken as the first
terminus ad quem the words "to restore and to build Jerusalem," till the
rebuilding of Jerusalem, till its completed rebuilding, till that
Jerusalem is again built; and then the further words, "unto the Messiah
the Prince," as the second terminus ad quem; and, finally, he assigns
the seven weeks to the first terminus ad quem, and the sixty-two weeks
is the second; as if the text comprehended two clauses, and declared
that from the going forth of the commandment till that Jerusalem was
rebuilt are seven heptades, and from that time till a Messiah, a Prince,
are sixty-two heptades.)

By the remark, "If the second designation of time is attributed to that
which follows, then we cannot otherwise explain it than that during
sixty-two weeks the streets will be restored and built up; but this
presents a very inappropriate meaning," - by this remark the
interpretation in question is neither shown to be possible, nor is it
made evident. For the meaning would be inappropriate only if by the
building up of Jerusalem we were to understand merely the rebuilding of
the city which was laid in ruins by the Chaldeans. If we attribute the
expression "and sixty-two weeks" to the first half of the verse, then
the division of the sixty-nine weeks into seven weeks and sixty-two
weeks is unaccountable; for in [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) we must then read, "after
sixty-nine weeks," and not, as we find it in the text, "after sixty-two
weeks." The substitution, again \[in [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md)\], of only this second
designation of time (sixty-two weeks) is also intelligible only if the
sixty-two weeks in [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) belong to
the second half of the verse, and are to be separated from the seven
weeks. The bringing together of the seven and of the sixty-two week
stands thus opposed to the context, and is maintained merely on the
supposition that the שׁבעים are year-weeks, or periods of time
consisting of seven years, in order that sixty-nine year-weeks, i.e.,
483 years, might be gained for the time from the rebuilding of Jerusalem
to Christ. But since there is in the word itself no foundation for
attaching to it this meaning, we have no right to distort the language
of the text according to it, but it is our duty to let this
interpretation fall aside as untenable, in order that we may do justice
to the words of the prophecy. The words here used demand that we connect
the period "and sixty-two weeks" with the second half of the verse, "and
during sixty-two weeks shall the street be built again," etc. The
"sixty-two weeks" are not united antithetically to the "seven weeks" by
the copula ,ו as Hofmann would have it, but are connected simply as
following the seven; so that that which is named as the contents of the
"sixty-two weeks" is to be interpreted as happening first after the
appearance of the Maschiach Nagid, or, more distinctly, that the
appearance of the Messias forming the terminus ad quem of the seven
weeks, forms at the same time the terminus a quo of the sixty-two weeks.
That event which brings the close of the sixty-two weeks is spoken of in
[Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) in the words משׁיח יכּרת,
Messiah shall be cut off. The words "and sixty-two שׁבעים owt-ytx" may
be taken grammatically either as the absolute nominative or as the
accusative of duration. The words ונבנתה תּשׁוּב refer undoubtedly to
the expression ולבנות להשׁיב (to restore and to build), according to
which תּשׁוּב is not to be joined adverbially to ונבנתה (according to
Hvernick, Hofmann, and Wieseler), but is to be rendered intransitively,
corresponding to השׁיב: shall be restored, as [Eze
16:55](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#055.md); [Kg1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#006.md); [Kg2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#010.md),[Kg2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014.md); [Exo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#007.md). The subject to both verbs is not
(Rosenmller, Gesenius, v. Leng., Hgstb.) רחוב, but Jerusalem, as is
manifest from the circumstance that the verbs refer to the restoration
and the building of Jerusalem, and is placed beyond a doubt by this,
that in [Zac 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#005.md) רחוב is construed as
masculine; and the opinion that it is generis faem. rests only on this
passage before us. There is no substantial reason for interpreting (with
Klief.) the verbs impersonally.

The words וחרוּץ רחוב are difficult, and many interpretations have been
given of them. There can be no doubt that they contain together one
definition, and that רחוב is to be taken as the adverbial accusative.
רחוב means the street and the wide space before the gate of the temple.
Accordingly, to חרוּץ have been given the meanings ditch, wall, aqueduct
(Ges., Steud., Znd., etc.), pond (Ewald), confined space (Hofmann),
court (Hitzig); but all these meanings are only hit upon from the
connection, as are also the renderings of the lxx εἰς πλάτος καὶ μῆκος,
of Theod. πλατεῖα καὶ τεῖχος, and of the Vulg. platea et muri. חרץ means
to cut, then to decide, to determine, to conclude irrevocably; hence
חרוּץ, decision, judgment, [Joe 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#014.md).
This meaning is maintained by Hv., Hgstb., v. Leng., Wies., and Kran.,
and וחרוּץ is interpreted as a participle: "and it is determined." This
shall form a contrast to the words, "but in the oppression of the times"
- and it is determined, namely, that Jerusalem shall be built in its
streets, but the building shall be accomplished in troublous times. But
although this interpretation be well founded as regards the words
themselves, it does not harmonize with the connection. The words וחרוּץ
רחוב plainly go together, as the old translators have interpreted them.
Now רחוב does not mean properly street, but a wide, free space, as [Ezr
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#009.md), the open place before the
temple, and is applied to streets only in so far as they are free,
unoccupied spaces in cities. חרוּץ, that which is cut off, limited,
forms a contrast to this, not, however, as that we may interpret the
words, as Hofm. does, in the sense of width, and space cut off, not
capable of extension, or free space and limited quarter (Hitzig), an
interpretation which is too far removed from the primary import of the
two words. It is better to interpret them, with Kliefoth, as "wide
space, and yet also limited," according to which we have the meaning,
"Jerusalem shall be built so that the city takes in a wide space, has
wide, free places, but not, however, unlimited in width, but such that
their compass is measured off, is fixed and bounded."

The last words, העתּים וּבצוק, point to the circumstances under which
the building proceeds: in the difficulty, the oppression of the times.
The book of Nehemiah, 3:33; [Neh 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md).,
[Dan 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001.md)., 9:36, 37, furnishes a
historical exposition of them, although the words do not refer to the
building of the walls and bulwarks of the earthly Jerusalem which was
accomplished by Nehemiah, but are to be understood, according to Ps.
51:20, of the spiritual building of the City of God.

[Daniel 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 9:26</span></span>

After the threescore and two weeks, i.e., in the seventieth שׁבוּע,
shall the Messiah be cut off. - From the אחרי (after) it does not with
certainty follow that the "cutting off" of the Maschiach falls wholly in
the beginning of the seventieth week, but only that the "cutting off"
shall constitute the first great event of this week, and that those
things which are mentioned in the remaining part of the verse shall then
follow. The complete designation of the time of the "cutting off" can
only be found from the whole contents of [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md). נכרת, from כּרּת, to hew down,
to fell, to cut to pieces, signifies to be rooted up, destroyed,
annihilated, and denotes generally a violent kind of death, though not
always, but only the uprooting from among the living, or from the
congregation, and is therefore the usual expression for the destruction
of the ungodly - e.g., [Psa 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#009.md); [Pro
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#022.md) - without particularly
designating the manner in which this is done. From יכּרת it cannot thus
be strictly proved that this part of the verse announces the putting to
death of an anointed one, or of the Messiah. Of the word Maschiach three
possible interpretations have been given: 1. That the Maschiach Nagid of
[Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), the Maschiach of [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), and the Nagid of [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), are three different persons; 2.
that all the three expressions denote one and the same person; and 3.
that the Maschiach Nagid of [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md)
and the Maschiach of [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) are the
same person, and that the Nagid of [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) is another and a different
person. The first of these has been maintained by J. D. Michaelis, Jahn.
Ebrard understands by all the three expressions the Messiah, and
supposes that he is styled fully Maschiach Nagid in [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) in order that His calling and His
dignity (משׁיח), as well as His power and strength (נגיד), might be
designated; in [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), משׁיח, the
anointed, where mention is made of His sufferings and His rejection; in
[Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), נגיד, the prince, where
reference is made to the judgment which He sends (by the Romans on
apostate Jerusalem). But this view is refuted by the circumstance that
הבּא (that is to come) follows נגיד, whereby the prince is represented
as first coming, as well as by the circumstance that הבּא נגיד, who
destroys the city and the sanctuary, whose end shall be with a flood,
consequently cannot be the Messiah, but is the enemy of the people and
kingdom of God, who shall arise ([Dan
7:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024).md) in the last time. But if in
[Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) the Nagid is different from
the Maschiach, then both also appear to be different from the Maschiach
Nagid of [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md). The circumstance
that in [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) משׁיח has neither
the article nor the addition נגיד following it, appears to be in favour
of this opinion. The absence of the one as well as the other denotes
that משׁיח, after that which is said of Him, in consideration of the
connection of the words, needs no more special description. If we
observe that the destruction of the city and the sanctuary is so
connected with the Maschiach that we must consider this as the immediate
or first consequence of the cutting off of the Maschiach, and that the
destruction shall be brought about by a Nagid, then by Maschiach we can
understand neither a secular prince or king nor simply a high priest,
but only an anointed one who stands in such a relation to the city and
sanctuary, that with his being "cut off" the city and the sanctuary lose
not only their protection and their protector, but the sanctuary also
loses, at the same time, its character as the sanctuary, which the
Maschiach had given to it. This is suitable to no Jewish high priest,
but only to the Messias whom Jehovah anointed to be a Priest-King after
the order of Melchizedek, and placed as Lord over Zion, His holy hill.
We agree therefore with Hvernick, Hengstenberg, Auberlen, and Kliefoth,
who regard the Maschiach of this verse as identical with the Maschiach
Nagid of [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), as Christ, who in
the fullest sense of the word is the Anointed; and we hope to establish
this view more fully in the following exposition of the historical
reference of this word of the angel.

But by this explanation of the משׁיח we are not authorized to regard the
word יכּרת as necessarily pointing to the death of the Messias, the
crucifixion of Christ, since יכּרת, as above shown, does not necessarily
denote a violent death. The right interpretation of this word depends on
the explanation of the words לו ואין which follow - words which are very
differently interpreted by critics. The supposition is grammatically
inadmissible that לו אין = איננּוּ (Michaelis, Hitzig), although the lxx
in the Codex Chisianus have translated them by καὶ οὐκ ἔσται; and in
general all those interpretations which identify אין with לא, as e.g.,
et non sibi, and not for himself (Vitringa, Rosenmller, Hvernick, and
others). For אין is never interchanged with לא, but is so distinguished
from it that לא, non, is negation purely, while אין, "it is not," denies
the existence of the thing; cf. Hengstenberg's Christol. iii. p. 81f.,
where all the passages which Gesenius refers to as exemplifying this
exchange are examined and rightly explained, proving that אין is never
used in the sense of לא. Still less is לו to be taken in the sense of לו
(&lt;) אשׁר, "there shall not then be one who (belongs) to him;" for
although the pronomen relat. may be wanting in short sentences, yet that
can be only in such as contain a subject to which it can refer. But in
the אין no subject is contained, but only the non-existence is declared;
it cannot be said: no one is, or nothing is. In all passages where it is
thus rightly translated a participle follows, in which the personal or
actual subject is contained, of which the non-existence is predicated.
לו (&lt;) אין without anything following is elliptical, and the subject
which is not, which will not be, is to be learned from the context or
from the matter itself. The missing subject here cannot be משׁיח,
because לו points back to משׁיח; nor can it be עם, people (Vulg.,
Grotius), or a descendant (Wieseler), or a follower (Auberlen), because
all these words are destitute of any support from the context, and are
brought forward arbitrarily. Since that which "is not to Him" is not
named, we must thus read the expression in its undefined universality:
it is not to Him, viz., that which He must have, to be the Maschiach. We
are not by this to think merely of dominion, people, sanctuary, but
generally of the place which He as Maschiach has had, or should have,
among His people and in the sanctuary, but, by His being "cut off," is
lost. This interpretation is of great importance in guiding to a correct
rendering of יכּרת; for it shows that יכּרת does not denote the putting
to death, or cutting off of existence, but only the annihilation of His
place as Maschiach among His people and in His kingdom. For if after His
"cutting off" He has not what He should have, it is clear that
annihilation does not apply to Him personally, but only that He has lost
His place and function as the Maschiach.

(Note: Kranichfeld quite appropriately compares the strong expression
יכּרת with "the equally strong יבלּא (shall wear out) in [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md), spoken of that which shall
befall the saints on the part of the enemy of God in the last great war.
As by this latter expression destruction in the sense of complete
annihilation cannot be meant, since the saints personally exist after
the catastrophe (cf. [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), [Dan
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#022.md), [Dan
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018).md), so also by this expression here
(יכּרת) we are not to understand annihilation.")

In consequence of the cutting off of the משׁיח destruction falls upon
the city and the sanctuary. This proceeds from the people of the prince
who comes. ישׁחית, to destroy, to ruin, is used, it is true, of the
desolating of countries, but predicated of a city and sanctuary it means
to overthrow; cf. e.g., [Gen 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#013.md).,
where it is used of the destruction of Sodom; and even in the case of
countries the השׁחית consists in the destruction of men and cattle; cf.
[Jer 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029.md).

The meaning of הבּא נגיד עם depends chiefly on the interpretation of the
הבּא. This we cannot, with Ebrard, refer to עם. Naturally it is
connected with נגיד, not only according to the order of the words, but
in reality, since in the following verse ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md) the people are no longer spoken
of, but only the actions and proceedings of the prince are described.
הבּא does not mean qui succedit (Roesch, Maurer), but is frequently used
by Daniel of a hostile coming; cf. [Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md); [Dan
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010.md),[Dan
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013.md), [Dan
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#015.md). But in this sense הבּא appears
to be superfluous, since it is self-evident that the prince, if he will
destroy Jerusalem, must come or draw near. One also must not say that
הבּא designates the prince as one who was to come (ἐρχόμενος), since
from the expression "coming days," as meaning "future days," it does not
follow that a "coming prince" is a "future prince." The הבּא with the
article: "he who comes, or will come," denotes much rather the נגיד
(which is without the article) as such an one whose coming is known, of
whom Daniel has heard that he will come to destroy the people of God.
But in the earlier revelations Daniel heard of two princes who shall
bring destruction on his people: in [Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md), [Dan
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024.md)., of Antichrist; and in [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md)., 23ff., of Antiochus. To one of
these the הבּא points. Which of the two is meant must be gathered from
the connection, and this excludes the reference to Antiochus, and
necessitates our thinking of the Antichrist.

In the following clause: "and his end with the flood," the suffix refers
simply to the hostile Nagid, whose end is here emphatically placed over
against his coming (Kran., Hofm., Kliefoth). Preconceived views as to
the historical interpretation of the prophecy lie at the foundation of
all other references. The Messianic interpreters, who find in the words
a prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and thus
understand by the Nagid Titus, cannot apply the suffix to Nagid. M.
Geier, Hvernick, and others, therefore, refer it (the suffix) to the
city and the sanctuary; but that is grammatically inadmissible, since
העיר (the city) is gen faem. Aub. and others refer it, therefore, merely
to the sanctuary; but the separation of the city from the sanctuary is
quite arbitrary. Vitringa, C. B. Michaelis, Hgstb., interpret the suffix
as neuter, and refer it to ישׁחית (shall destroy), or, more correctly,
to the idea of destroying comprehended in it, for they understand שׁטף
of a warlike overflowing flood: "and the end of it shall be (or: it
shall end) in the flood." On the other hand, v. Lengerke and Kliefoth
have rightly objected to this view. "This reference of the suffix," they
say, "is inadmissibly harsh; the author must have written erroneously,
since he suggested the reference of the suffix to עם or to נגיד. One
cannot think of what is meant by the end of the destruction, since the
destruction itself is the end; a flood may, it is true, be an emblem of
a warlike invasion of a country, but it never signifies the warlike
march, the expedition." There thus remains nothing else than to apply
the suffix to the Nagid, the prince. קץ can accordingly only denote the
destruction of the prince. Hitzig's interpretation, that קצּו is the
result of his coming, refutes itself.

In בּשׁטף the article is to be observed, by which alone such
interpretations as "in an overflowing" (Ros., Roed., and others), "vi
quadam ineluctabili oppressus" (Steudel, Maurer), "like an overflowing,"
and the like, are proved to be verbally inadmissible. The article shows
that a definite and well-known overflowing is meant. שׁטף,
"overflowing," may be the emblem of an army spreading itself over the
land, as in [Dan 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010.md),[Dan
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022.md), [Dan
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#026.md); [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md), or the emblem of a judgment
desolating or destroying a city, country, or people; cf. [Psa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md); [Nah
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md); [Pro
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#004.md); [Psa
90:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005.md). The first of these
interpretations would give this meaning: The prince shall find his end
in his warlike expedition; and the article in בּשׁטף would refer back to
הבּא. This interpretation is indeed quite possible, but not very
probable, because שׁטף would then be the overflowing which was caused by
the hostile prince or his coming, and the thought would be this, that he
should perish in it. But this agrees neither with the following clause,
that war should be to the end, nor with [Dan
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#021.md), [Dan
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026.md), according to which the enemy of
God holds the superiority till he is destroyed by the judgment of God.
Accordingly, we agree with Wieseler, Hofmann, Kranichfeld, and Kliefoth
in adopting the other interpretation of שׁטף, flood, as the figure of
the desolating judgment of God, and explain the article as an allusion
to the flood which overwhelmed Pharaoh and his host. Besides, the whole
passage is, with Maurer and Klief., to be regarded as a relative clause,
and to be connected with הבּא: the people of a prince who shall come and
find his destruction in the flood.

This verse ([Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md) contains a
third statement, which adds a new element to the preceding. Rosenmller,
Ewald, Hofm., and others connect these into one passage, thus: and to
the end of the war a decree of desolations continues. But although קץ,
grammatically considered, is the stat. constr., and might be connected
with מלחמה (war), yet this is opposed by the circumstance, that in the
preceding sentence no mention is expressly made of war; and that if the
war which consisted in the destruction of the city should be meant, then
מלחמה ought to have the article. From these reasons we agree with the
majority of interpreters in regarding מלחמה as the predicate of the
passage: "and to the end is war;" but we cannot refer קץ, with Wieseler,
to the end of the prince, or, with Hv. and Aub., to the end of the city,
because קץ has neither a suffix nor an article. According to the just
remark of Hitzig, קץ without any limitation is the end generally, the
end of the period in progress, the seventy שׁבעים, and corresponds to
סופא עד in [Dan 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026.md), to the end of
all things, [Dan 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013) (Klief..md). To
the end war shall be = war shall continue during the whole of the last
שׁבוּע.

The remaining words, שׁממות נחרצת, form an apposition to מלחמה,
notwithstanding the objection by Kliefoth, that since desolations are a
consequence of the war, the words cannot be regarded as in apposition.
For we do not understand why in abbreviated statements the effect cannot
be placed in the form of an apposition to the cause. The objection also
overlooks the word נחרצת. If desolations are the effect of the war, yet
not the decree of the desolations, which can go before the war or can be
formed during the war. שׁממות denotes desolation not in an active, but
in a passive sense: laid waste, desolated. נחרצת, that which is
determined, the irrevocably decreed; therefore used of divine decrees,
and that of decrees with reference to the infliction of punishment; cf.
[Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md); [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md); [Isa
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md); [Isa
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022.md). Ewald is quite in error when he
says that it means "the decision regarding the fearful deeds, the divine
decision as it embodies itself in the judgments ([Dan
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#011)..md) on the world on account of such
fearful actions and desolations," because שׁממות has not the active
meaning. Auberlen weakens its force when he renders it "decreed
desolations." "That which is decreed of desolations" is also not a
fixed, limited, measured degree of desolations (Hofm., Klief.); for in
the word there does not lie so much the idea of limitation to a definite
degree, as much rather the idea of the absolute decision, as the
connection with כלה in [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), as
well as in the two passages from Isaiah above referred to, shows. The
thought is therefore this: "Till the end war will be, for desolations
are irrevocably determined by God." Since שׁממות has nothing qualifying
it, we may not limit the "decree of desolations" to the laying waste of
the city and the sanctuary, but under it there are to be included the
desolations which the fall of the prince who destroys the city and the
sanctuary shall bring along with it.

[Daniel 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 9:27</span></span>

This verse contains four statements. - The first is: "He shall confirm
the covenant to many for one week." Following the example of Theodotion,
many (Hv., Hgstb., Aub., v. Leng., Hitzig, Hofm.) regard אחד שׁבוּע אח
as the subject: one week shall confirm the covenant to many. But this
poetic mode of expression is only admissible where the subject treated
of in the statement of the speaker comes after the action, and therefore
does not agree with בּרית הגבּיר, where the confirming of the covenant
is not the work of time, but the deed of a definite person. To this is
to be added the circumstance that the definitions of time in this verse
are connected with those in [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md),
and are analogous to them, and must therefore be alike interpreted in
both passages. But if, notwithstanding these considerations, we make אחד
שׁבוּע the subject, the question then presses itself upon us, Who
effects the confirming of the covenant? Hvernick, Hengstenberg, and
Auberlen regard the Messias as the subject, and understand by the
confirming of the covenant, the confirming of the New Covenant by the
death of Christ. Ewald, v. Lengerke, and others think of Antiochus and
the many covenants which, according to 1 Macc. 1:12, he established
between the apostate Jews and the heathen Greeks. Hitzig understands by
the "covenant" the O.T. Covenant, and gives to הגבּיר the meaning to
make grievous: The one week shall make the covenant grievous to many,
for they shall have to bear oppression on account of their faith. On the
other hand, Hofmann (Schriftbew.) renders it: The one week shall confirm
many in their fidelity to the faith. But none of these interpretations
can be justified. The reasons which Hengstenberg adduces in support of
his view that the Messias is the subject, are destitute of validity. The
assertion that the Messias is the chief person spoken of in the whole of
this passage, rests on the supposition, already proved to be untenable,
that the prince who was to come ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md) was the instrument of the
Anointed, and on the passages in [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md); [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006.md), which are not parallel to that
under consideration. The connection much more indicates that Nagid is
the subject to הגבּיר, since the prince who was to come is named last,
and is also the subject in the suffix of קצּו (his end), the last clause
of [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) having only the
significance of an explanatory subordinate clause. Also "the taking away
of the daily sacrifice combines itself in a natural way with the
destruction ([Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md) of the city
and the temple brought about by the הבּא נגיד;" - further, "he who here
is represented as 'causing the sacrifice and oblation to cease' is
obviously identical with him who changes ([Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025).md) the times and usages of worship
(more correctly: times and law)" (Kran.). "The reference of הגבּיר to
the ungodly leader of an army, is therefore according to the context and
the parallel passages of this book which have been mentioned, as well as
in harmony with the natural grammatical arrangement of the passage," and
it gives also a congruous sense, although by the Nagid Titus cannot
naturally be understood. בּרית הגבּיר means to strengthen a covenant,
i.e., to make a covenant strong (Hitzig has not established the
rendering: to make grievous). "Covenant" does not necessarily mean the
covenant of God (Old Testament or New Testament Covenant), since the
assertion that this word occurs only in this book with reference to the
covenant of God with Israel (Hgstb.) does not also prove that it must
here have this meaning; and with expression בּרית הגבּיר with ל is
analogous to בּרית כּרּת \[icere faedus\] with ל; and the construction
with ל signifies that as in the forming of a covenant, so in the
confirming of a covenant, the two contracting parties are not viewed as
standing on an equality, but he who concludes or who confirms the
covenant prevails, and imposes or forces the covenant on the other
party. The reference to the covenant of God with man is thus indeed
suggested, yet it is not rendered necessary, but only points to a
relation analogous to the concluding of a covenant emanating from God.
לרבּים with the article signifies the many, i.e., the great mass of the
people in contrast with the few, who remain faithful to God; cf. [Mat
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012.md). Therefore the thought is this:
That ungodly prince shall impose on the mass of the people a strong
covenant that they should follow him and give themselves to him as their
God.

While the first clause of this verse announces what shall happen during
the whole of the last week, the second treats only of the half of this
period. השׁבוּע חצי we cannot grammatically otherwise interpret than the
definition of time mentioned immediately before, and thus, for reasons
give above, cannot take it as the subject of the clause, but only as the
accusative of the duration of time, consequently not in the sense of the
ablative: in the midst of the week. The controversy whether חצי here
means half, or midst, has no bearing on the matter, and acquires
significance only if we interpret חצי, in opposition to the context, as
synonymous with בּחצי, or with Klief., which is equally untenable and
impossible in this context, regard השׁבוּע חצי as an absolute
definition. חצי signifies only half, not midst. Only where the
representation of an extent of space or period of time prevails can we
render it, without a change of its meaning, by the word midst. In the
half of the night is the same as in the middle of the night, at
midnight, [Exo 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md); in the half of
the firmament, [Jos 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md), is the same
as in the middle of the space of the heavens across which the sun moves
during day; in the half of the day of life is the same as in the middle
of the period of life, [Psa 102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md).
But during the half of the week is not the same as: in the middle of the
week. And the objection, that if we here take חצי in the sense of half,
then the heptad or cycle of seven would be divided into two halves
(Klief.), and yet of only one of them was anything said, is without
significance, because it would touch also the explanation "and in the
midst of the heptad," since in this case of the first, before the middle
of the expiring half of the week, nothing also is said of what shall be
done in it. If Kliefoth answers this objection by saying that we must
conceive of this from the connection, namely, that which brings the
power of Antichrist to its height, then we shall be able also, in the
verbally correct interpretation of השׁבוּע חצי, to conceive from the
connection what shall happen in the remaining period of the שׁבוּע. Yet
weaker is the further objection: "that which is mentioned as coming to
pass השׁבוּע חצי, the causing of the offering of sacrifice to cease, is
something which takes place not during a period of time, but at a
terminus" (Kliefoth); for since השׁבּית does not properly mean to
remove, but to make to rest, to make quiet, it is thus not conceivable
why we should not be able to say: The sacrifice shall be made to rest,
or made still, during half a week.

In the verbally correct interpretation of השׁבוּע חצי, the supposition
that the second half of the heptad is meant loses its support, for the
terminus a quo of this half remains undefined if it cannot be determined
from the subject itself. But this determination depends on whether the
taking away of the sacrifice is to be regarded as the putting a complete
termination to it, or only the causing of a temporary cessation to the
service of sacrifice, which can be answered only by our first
determining the question regarding the historical reference of this
divine revelation. וּמנחה זבח, bloody and unbloody sacrifice, the two
chief parts of the service of sacrifice, represent the whole of worship
by sacrifice. The expression is more comprehensive than התּמיד, [Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md), the continuance in worship, the
daily morning and evening sacrifice, the cessation of which does not
necessarily involve the putting an end to the service of sacrifice.

The third clause of this verse, משׁמם שׁקּוּצים כּנף ועל, is difficult,
and its interpretation has been disputed. The lxx have rendered it: καὶ
ἐπὶ τὸ ἱερὸν βδέλυγμα τῶν ἐρημώσεων ἔσται. Theodotion has given the same
rendering, only omitting ἔσται. The Vulgate has: et erit in templo
abominatio desolationis. The church interpreters have explained the
words in accordance with these translations, understanding by שׁקּוּצים
כּנף the abomination of idols in the temple, or the temple desecrated by
the abomination of idols. Hvernick explains the words of the extreme
height of abomination, i.e., of the highest place that can be reached
where the abominations would be committed, i.e., the temple as the
highest point in Jerusalem; Hengstenberg, on the contrary, regards the
"wing of the abominations" as the pinnacle of the temple so desecrated
by the abomination that it no longer deserved the name of a temple of
the Lord, but the name of an idol-temple. Auberlen translates it "on
account of the desolating summit of abominations," and understands by it
the summit of the abominations committed by Israel, which draws down the
desolation, because it is the desolation itself, and which reached its
acme in the desecration of the temple by the Zealots shortly before the
destruction of Jerusalem. But no one of these interpretations is
justified by the language here used, because כּנף does not signify
summit, highest point. This word, it is true, is often used figuratively
of the extremity or skirt of the upper garment or cloak ([Sa1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#027.md); [Sa1
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#005.md); [Hag
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#012).md), of the uttermost part, end, of
the earth, [Isa 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016.md), and frequently
in the plur. of the borders of the earth, in the rabbin. also of the
lobes of the lungs, but demonstrably never of the summit as the highest
point or peak of an object; and thus can mean neither the temple as the
highest point in Jerusalem, nor the pinnacle of the temple desecrated by
the abomination, nor the summit of the abomination committed by Israel.
"It is used indeed," as Bleek (Jahrbb. v. p. 93) also remarks, "of the
extreme point of an object, but only of that which is extended
horizontally (for end, or extremity), but never of that which is
extended perpendicularly (for peak)." The use of it in the latter sense
cannot also be proved from the πτερύγιον τοῦ ἱεροῦ, [Mat
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md); [Luk
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#009.md). Here the genitive τοῦ ἱεροῦ, not
τοῦ ναοῦ, shows that not the pinnacle, i.e., the summit of the temple
itself, is meant, but a wing or adjoining building of the sanctuary; and
if Suidas and Hesychius explain πτερύγιον by ἀκρωτήριον, this
explanation is constructed only from the passages of the N.T. referred
to, and is not confirmed by the Greek classics.

But though πτερύγιον may have the meaning of summit, yet this can by no
means be proved to be the meaning of כּנף. Accordingly שׁקּוּצים כּנף
cannot on verbal grounds be referred to the temple. This argument from
the words used is not set aside by other arguments which Hengstenberg
brings forward, neither by the remark that this explanation harmonizes
well with the other parts of the prophecy, especially the removal of the
sacrifice and the destruction of the temple, nor by the reference to the
testimony of tradition and to the authority of the Lord. For, with
reference to that remark, we have already shown in the explanation of
the preceding verses that they do not refer to the destruction of
Jerusalem by Titus, and thus are not reconcilable with this
interpretation of שׁקּוּצים כּנף. But the testimony of tradition for
this interpretation in Josephus, De bello Jud. iv. 6. 3, that by the
desecration of the temple on the part of the Zealots an old prophecy
regarding the destruction of the temple was fulfilled, itself
demonstrates (under the supposition that no other passage occur in the
book of Daniel in which Josephus would be able to find the announcement
of bloody abomination in the temple which proceeded even from the
members of the covenant people) nothing further than that Josephus, with
many of his contemporaries, found such a prophecy in this verse in the
Alexandrine translation, but it does not warrant the correctness of this
interpretation of the passage. This warrant would certainly be afforded
by the words of our Lord regarding "the abomination of desolation spoken
of by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place" ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md).; [Mar
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014).md), if it were decided that the
Lord had this passage ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md)
alone before His mind, and that He regarded the "abomination of
desolation" as a sign announcing the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Romans. But neither of these conditions is established. The expression
βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως is found not only in [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) (where the lxx and Theod. have
the plur. ἐρημώσεων), but also in [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031) (βδ. ἐρημώσεως.md) and [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011) (τὸ βδ. τῆς ἐρημώσεως.md), and thus
may refer to one of these passages. The possibility of this reference is
not weakened by the objection, "that the prophecy Daniel 11 and [Dan
12:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) was generally regarded as
fulfilled in the Maccabean times, and that the fulfilling of Daniel 9
was placed forward into the future in the time of Christ" (Hgstb.),
because the Lord can have a deeper and more correct apprehension of the
prophecies of Daniel than the Jewish writers of His time;
because,moreover, the first historical fulfilling of Daniel 11 in the
Maccabean times does not exclude a further and a fuller accomplishment
in the future, and the rage of Antiochus Epiphanes against the Jewish
temple and the worship of God can be a type of the assault of Antichrist
against the sanctuary and the church of God in the time of the end.
Still less from the words, "whoso readeth, let him understand" ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).md), can it be proved that Christ
had only [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), and not also [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md) or [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), before His view. The remark
that these words refer to בּדּבר בּין (understand the matter), [Dan
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023.md), and to ותשׂכּל ותדע (know, and
understand), does not avail for this purpose, because this reference is
not certain, and בּין את־הדּבר dna ,n (and he understood the thing) is
used ([Dan 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001).md) also of the prophecy
in Daniel 10 and 11. But though it were beyond a doubt that Christ had,
in the words quoted, only [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md)
before His view, yet would the reference of this prophecy to the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans not be thereby proved, because in
His discourse Christ spake not only of this destruction of the ancient
Jerusalem, but generally of His παρουσία and the συντέλεια τοῦ αἰῶνος
([Mat 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003).md), and referred the words of
Daniel of the βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως to the παρουσία τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ
ἀνθρώπου.

On these grounds we must affirm that the reference of the words under
consideration to the desecration of the temple before the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Romans is untenable.

But also the reference of these words, as maintained by other
interpreters, to the desecration of the temple by the βδέλυγμα ἐρημώσεως
(1 Macc. 1:54), built on the altar of burnt-offering by Antiochus
Epiphanes, is disproved on the verbal ground that כּנף cannot designate
the surface of the altar. In favour of this view the משׁמם השּׁקּוּץ,
[Dan 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md) (the abomination that
maketh desolate), is principally relied on, in order to establish the
connection of משׁמם with שׁקּוּצים; but that passage is of a different
character, and the difference of number between them opposes the
connecting together of these two words. The singular משׁמם cannot be
connected as an adjective with שׁקּוּצים. But the uniting of משׁמם with
the noun כּנף gives no meaning, and besides has the parallels [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md) and [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md) against it. In this passage
before us משׁמם can only be the subject; and the clause is neither to be
connected with the preceding nor with the following, but is to be
interpreted as containing an independent statement. Since in the
preceding context mention is made of a Nagid who shall make desolate the
city and the sanctuary, and shall take away the bloody and the unbloody
sacrifice, it is natural to regard the משׁמם, desolater, as the Nagid,
and to identify the two. The circumstance that it does not refer to it
by the article (המּשׁמם) is no valid objection, because the article is
in no way necessary, as משׁמם is a participle, and can be rendered as
such: "on the wings of abomination he comes desolating." כּנף על can,
without ingenuity, be rendered in no other way than on wings. שׁקּוּצים
signifies not acts of abomination, but objects of abomination, things
causing abomination, and is constantly used of the heathen gods,
idol-images, sacrifices to the gods, and other heathen abominations. The
connection of שׁקּוּצים permits us, however, with Reichel, Ebrard,
Kliefoth, and Kranichfeld, to think on nothing else than that wings
(כּנף) are attributed to the שׁקּוּצים. The sing. כּנף does not oppose
this, since it is often used collectively in a peculiar and figurative
meaning; cf. e.g., כּנף בּעל, [Pro
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017.md), with כּנפים בּעל, [Ecc
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md), the winged, the bird; and הארץ
dna ;drib כּנף (from the uttermost part of the earth), [Isa
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016.md), is not different from הארץ
כּנפות, [Job 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#003.md); [Job
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#013.md), just as אברה, wing, plumage,
[Psa 91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004.md); [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011), is found for אברות (wings.md),
[Psa 68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014.md). But from such passages as
[Deu 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md); [Exo
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004.md), and [Psa
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md), we perceive the sense in which
wings are attributed to the שׁקּוּצים, the idolatrous objects.

(Note: The interpretation of J. D. Michaelis, which has been revived by
Hofmann, needs no serious refutation. They hold that שׁקּוּצים כּנף
signifies an idol-bird, and denotes the eagle of Jupiter of Zeus. Hofm.
repeats this interpretation in his Schriftbew. ii. 2, p. 592, after he
had abandoned it.)

In the first of these passages ([Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011).md), wings, the wings of an eagle,
are attributed to God, because He is the power which raises up Israel,
and lifting it up, and carrying it throughout its history, guides it
over the earth. In P. 18 wings are attributed to the wind, because the
wind is contemplated as the power which carries out the will of God
throughout the kingdom of nature. "Thus in this passage wings are
attributed to the שׁקּוּצים, idol-objects, and to idolatry with its
abominations, because that shall be the power which lifts upwards the
destroyer and desolater, carries him, and moves with him over the earth
to lay waste" (Klief.).

(Note: Similarly, and independently of Kliefoth, Kranichfeld also
explains the words: "The powerful heathen enemy of God is here conceived
of as carried on (על) these wings of the idol-abomination, like as the
God of the theocracy is borne on the wings of the clouds, and on
cherubim, who are His servants; cf. [Psa
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md); [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003).".md)

The last clause, וגו ועד־כּלה, is differently construed, according as
the subject to תּתּך, which is wanting, or appears to be wanting, is
sought to be supplied from the context. Against the supposition of
Hvernick and Ebrard, who take תּתּך as impersonal: "it pours down," it
is rightly objected that this word is never so found, and can so much
the less be so interpreted here, since in [Dan
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011.md) it is preceded by a definite
subject. Others supply a subject, such as anger (Berth.), or curse and
oath from [Dan 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011.md); the former is
quite arbitrary, the latter is too far-fetched. Others, again
(Hengstenberg, Maurer), take ונחרצה כלה (the consummation and that
determined) as the subject. This is correct according to the matter. We
cannot, however, so justify the regarding of ועד as a conjunction: till
that; for, though עד is so used, ועד is not; nor, once more, can we
justify the taking of ונחרצה כלה as a whole as the subject (Hofmann), or
of ונחרצה alone as the subject (v. Leng., Hitzig, Kliefoth), since ועד
is not repeated before ונחרצה on account of the ו(with v. Leng.), nor is
ונחרצה alone supplied (with Hitz.), nor is the וbefore נחרצה to be
regarded (with Klief.) as a sign of the conclusion. Where וintroduces
the conclusion, as e.g., [Dan 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md), it
is there united with the verb, and thus the expression here should in
that case be נחרצה ותּתּך. The relative interpretation of תּתּך is the
only one which is verbally admissible, whereby the words, "and till the
consummation and that determined," are epexegetically connected to the
foregoing clause: "and till the consummation and that determined which
shall pour down upon the desolater." The words ונחרצה כלה remind us of
[Isa 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md) and [Isa
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022.md), and signify that which is
completed = altogether and irrevocably concluded, i.e., substantially
the inflexibly decreed judgment of destruction. The words have here this
meaning, as is clear from the circumstance that נחרצה points back to
שׁממות נחרצת ([Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), desolations
are determined), and כלה עד corresponds to קץ עד ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md). In [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md) משׁמם is not in a similar manner
to be identified with שׁמם, but has the active signification: "laying
waste," while שׁמם has the passive: "laid waste." Both words refer to
the Nagid, but with this difference, that this ungodly prince who comes
as the desolater of the city and the sanctuary will on that account
become desolate, that the destruction irrevocably decreed by God shall
pour down upon him as a flood.

Let us now, after explaining the separate clauses, present briefly the
substance of this divine revelation. We find that the [Dan
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) contain the following
announcement: From the going forth of the word to restore and build
Jerusalem to the appearance of the Messias seven weeks shall pass away;
after that, during threescore and two weeks the city shall be restored
and built up amid the oppressions of the times; but after the sixty-two
weeks the Messias shall be cut off, so that to Him nothing remains, and
the city, together with the sanctuary, shall be destroyed by the people
of a prince who shall come, who shall find his end in the flood; but the
war shall continue to the end, since destruction is irrevocably decreed.
That prince shall force a strong covenant for one week on the mass of
the people, and during half a week shall take away the service of
sacrifice, and, borne on the wings of idol-abominations, shall carry on
a desolating rule, till the firmly decreed judgment shall pour itself
upon him as one desolated. - According to this, the first seven weeks
are determined merely according to their beginning and their end, and
nothing further is said as to their contents than may be concluded from
the definition of its terminus a quo, "to restore and to build
Jerusalem," namely, that the restoring and the building of this city
shall proceed during the period of time indicated. The sixty-two weeks
which follow these seven weeks, ending with the coming of the Messias,
have the same contents, only with the more special definition, that the
restoration and the building in the broad open place and in the limited
place shall be carried on in oppressive times. Hence it is clear that
this restoration and building cannot denote the rebuilding of the city
which was destroyed by the Chaldeans, but refers to the preservation and
extension of Jerusalem to the measure and compass determined by God in
the Messianic time, or under the dominion of the Messias, since He shall
come at the end of the seven weeks, and after the expiry of the
sixty-two weeks connected therewith shall be cut off, so that nothing
remains to Him.

The statements of the angel ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md) regarding the one week, which,
because of the connection, can only be the seventieth, or the last of
the seventy, are more ample. The cutting off of the Messias forms the
beginning of this week; then follows the destruction of the city and of
the sanctuary by the people of the coming prince, who shall find his end
in the flood, not immediately after his coming, but at the end of this
week; for the war shall continue to the end, and the prince shall take
away the service of sacrifice during half a week, till the desolation
determined as a flood shall pour down upon him, and make the desolater
desolated. If we compare with this the contents of [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), according to which seventy weeks
are determined to restrain transgression, to make an end of sin and
iniquity, partly by atonement and partly by shutting up, to bring in
everlasting righteousness, to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to
consecrate a new most holy, we shall find that the reciprocal statements
are so related to each other, that [Dan
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) present what shall be done in
the course of the seventy weeks, which are divided into three periods,
but [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md) what shall be the result
of all these things. The seventieth week ends, according to [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), with the judgment on the
destroyer of the city and the sanctuary of God; but with this judgment
shall be the conclusion of the divine counsel of salvation, or the
kingdom of God shall be consummated. This was revealed to the prophet in
Daniel 7, and thus does not need to be here expressly repeated. If that
which, according to [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), shall
happen with the expiry of the seventy appointed weeks stood after [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), then would the connection of the
judgment on the last enemy of God with the consummation of the kingdom
of God appear here also distinctly to view. But it was not necessary
after Daniel 7 to give express prominence to this connection here; and
Gabriel here first mentions the positive aim and end of the divine plan
of salvation with Israel, because he gives to the prophet a comforting
answer to remove his deep distress on account of his own sins, and the
sin and guilt of his people, and therein cannot conceal the severe
affliction which the future would bring, because he will announce to him
that by the sins of the people the working out of the deliverance
designed by God for them shall not be frustrated, but that in spite of
the great guilt of Israel the kingdom of God shall be perfected in
glory, sin and iniquity blotted out, everlasting righteousness restored,
the prophecy of the judgment and of salvation completed, and the
sanctuary where God shall in truth dwell among His people erected. In
order to establish this promise, so rich in comfort, and firmly to
ratify it to Daniel he unveils to him ([Dan
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025).md), in its great outlines, the
progress of the development of the kingdom of God, first from the end of
the Exile to the coming of the Messias; then from the appearance of
Christ to the time far in the future, when Christ shall be cut off, so
that nothing remains to Him; and finally, the time of the supremacy and
of the victory of the destroyer of the church of God, the Antichrist,
and the destruction of this enemy by the irrevocably determined final
judgment. If, now, in this he says nothing particular regarding the
first period of this development, regarding the time from the Exile to
Christ, the reason is, that he had already said all that was necessary
regarding the development of the world-kingdom, and its relation to the
kingdom and people of God, in the preceding revelation in Daniel 8. It
is the same angel Gabriel who (Daniel 8) comforted Daniel, and
interpreted to him the vision of the second and third world-kingdom, and
who here brings to him further revelations in answer to his prayer
regarding the restoration of the holy city, which was lying in ruins, as
is expressly remarked in [Dan 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021.md). -
Also regarding the second long period which passes from the appearance
of the Messias to His annihilation (Vernichtung), i.e., the destruction
of His kingdom on the earth, little is apparently said, but in reality
in the few words very much is said: that during this whole period the
restoration and building shall proceed amid the oppressions of the
times, namely, that the kingdom of God shall be built up to the extent
determined by God in this long period, although amid severe persecution.
this persecution shall during the last week mount up to the height of
the cutting off of Christ and the destruction of His kingdom on the
earth; but then with the extermination of the prince, the enemy of God,
it shall reach its end.

But if, according to what has been said, this revelation presents the
principal outlines of the development of the kingdom of God from the
time of Daniel to its consummation at the end of this epoch of the
world, the seventy שׁבעים which are appointed for it cannot be
year-weeks, or cycles of seven years, but only symbolically defined
periods of measured duration. This result of our exposition contradicts,
however, the usual interpretations of this prophecy so completely, that
in order to confirm our exposition, we must put thoroughly to the test
the two classes of opposing interpretations - which, however, agree in
this, that the definitions of time are to be understood chronologically,
and that under the שׁבעים year - weeks are to be understood-and examine
whether a chronological reckoning is in all respects tenable.

The first class of expositors who find the appearance of Christ in the
flesh and His crucifixion, as well as the destruction of Jerusalem by
the Romans, prophesied of in this passage, adduce in support of their
view, partly the agreement of the chronological periods, partly the
testimony of Christ, who referred [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) to the destruction of Jerusalem
by the Romans. How does it now stand with these two arguments?

The first Hengstenberg (Christol. iii. 1, p. 137) introduces with the
remark, "The predominant view in the synagogue and in the church has
always been, that the seventy weeks, as well as the shorter periods into
which the whole period is divided, are closely fixed and limited. The
opposite supposition becomes very suspicious by this, that it is
maintained only by such as come into conflict with the chronology by
their hypotheses, or take no interest in chronological investigations."
He then seeks first to confute the arguments brought forward in favour
of the supposition that the chronological definitions are only given in
the lump (in Bausch und Bogen), and then to present the positive
arguments for the definiteness of the chronological statements. But he
has in this identified the definiteness of the prophecy in general with
its chronological definiteness, while there is between these two ideas a
noticeable difference. Of the positive arguments adduced, the first is,
that the seventy weeks stand in closer relation to the seventy years of
Jeremiah, in so far as regards chronological definiteness, when the
seventy years of Jeremiah are understood as strictly chronological and
as chronologically fulfilled. But the force of this argument is
neutralized by the fact, that in Jeremiah a chronologically described
period, "years," is in this prophecy, on the contrary, designated by a
name the meaning of which is disputed, at all events is chronologically
indefinite, since weeks, if seven-day periods are excluded by the
contents off the prophecy, can as well signify Sabbath or jubilee
periods, seven-year or seven times seven-years epochs. Still weaker is
the second argument, that all the other designations of time with
reference to the future in the book of Daniel are definite; for this is
applicable only to the designations in [Dan
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md) and [Dan
12:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), in which evening-mornings
and days are named, but not to the passages [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md); [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md), and [Dan
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#013) (16.md), where the chronologically
indefinite expression, time, times, occurs, which are arbitrarily
identified with years.

There remains thus, for the determination of the time spoken of in this
prophecy, only the argument from its fulfilment, which should give the
decision for the chronological definiteness. But, on the contrary, there
arises a grave doubt, from the circumstance that among the advocates of
the so-called "church Messianic interpretation" the terminus a quo of
the prophecy is disputed; for some of these interpreters take the edict
of Cyrus (b.c. 536) as such, while, on the other hand, others take the
edict which Artaxerxes issued on the return of Ezra to Jerusalem for the
restoration of the service of God according to the law, in the
seventeenth year of his reign, i.e., in the year b.c. 457, and others,
again, among whom is Hengstenberg, take the journey of Nehemiah to
Jerusalem with the permission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, in the
twentieth year of Artaxerxes, i.e., b.c. 445, or according to
Hengstenberg, b.c. 455, as the terminus a quo of the seventy weeks - a
difference of eighty-one years, which in chronological reckoning is very
noticeable.

In our interpretation of [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), we
have given our decided opinion that the וגו להשׁיב דּבר, from the going
forth of which seventy years are to be reckoned, refers to the edict of
Cyrus permitting the Jews to return to their fatherland, and the
arguments in favour of that opinion are given above. Against this
reference to the edict of Cyrus, Hvernick, Hengstenberg, and Auberlen
have objected that in that edict there is nothing said of building up
the city, and that under Cyrus, as well as under the succeeding kings,
Cambyses, Darius Hystaspes, and Xerxes, nothing also is done for the
building of the city. We find it still unbuilt in the times of Ezra and
Nehemiah ([Ezr 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008.md); [Ezr
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#013.md); [Neh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md); [Neh
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003.md); 5:34; [Neh
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md); [Neh
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#004).md). Although from the nature of the
case the building of the temple supposes the existence also of houses in
Jerusalem (cf. [Hag 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004).md), yet there is
not a single trace of any royal permission for the restoration of the
people and the rebuilding of the city. Much rather this was expressly
forbidden (Ezra 4:7-23) by the same Artaxerxes Longimanus (who at a
later period gave the permission however), in consequence of the
slanderous reports of the Samaritans. "There was granted to the Jews a
religious, but not a political restoration." For the first time in the
seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus the affairs of Israel took a
favourable turn. In that year Artaxerxes granted to Ezra permission to
go to Jerusalem, entrusting him with royal letters of great importance
(Ezra 7:11-26, particularly [Ezr 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#018.md),
[Ezr 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#025)..md); in his twentieth year he
gave to Nehemiah express permission to rebuild the city (Neh 2).
Following the example of the old chronologist Julius Africanus in Jerome
and many others, Hv., Hgstb., Reinke, Reusch, and others regard the
twentieth year of Artaxerxes, while Auberlen, with Valovius, Newton, M.
Geier, Gaussen, Pusey, and others, regard the seventy years, as the
terminus a quo of the seventy weeks. But that the arguments derived from
the absence of any mention being made in the edict of Cyrus of the
building of Jerusalem against the reference of וגו דּבר מצא to that
edict are not very strong, at least are not decisive, is manifest from
what Auberlen has advanced for the seventh and against the twentieth
year. Proceeding from the proposition, correct in itself, that the time
of Ezra and that of Nehemiah form one connected period of blessing for
Israel, Auberlen thence shows that the edict relating to Nehemiah had
only a secondary importance, as the sacred narrative itself indicates by
the circumstance that it does not mention the edict at all ([Neh
2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#007).md), while the royal letters to
Ezra (Ezra 7) are given at large. Since it was the same king Artaxerxes
who sent away Ezra as well as Nehemiah, his heart must have been
favourably inclined toward Israel in his seventh year. "Then must the
word for the restoration and building of Jerusalem have gone forth from
God." The consciousness of this is expressed by Ezra himself, when,
after recording the royal edict ([Ezr
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#027).md), he continues: "Blessed be
Jehovah, the God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in
the king's heart, to beautify the house of the Lord which is in
Jerusalem; and hath extended mercy to me before the king and his
counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes."

But, we must reply, wherein does the mercy extended to Ezra before the
king consist? Is it in the permission to build up Jerusalem? Certainly
not, but in the beautifying the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem. And to
that alone the royal authority granted to Ezra (Ezra 7) refers. Of the
building of the city there is not a word said. Only the means, as it
appears, of restoring the temple-worship, which had fallen into great
decay, and of re-establishing the law of God corresponding thereto, were
granted to him in the long edict issued by the king.

(Note: Auberlen, it is true, remarks (p. 138): - "The authority given to
Ezra is so extensive that it essentially includes the rebuilding of the
city. It refers certainly, for the most part \[rather wholly,\] to the
service of the sanctuary; but not only must Ezra set up judges ([Ezr
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#025).md), he is also expressly permitted
by the king to expend as it seems good to him the rest of the silver and
gold ([Ezr 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#018).md). How he then
understood the commission, Ezra himself says clearly and distinctly in
his prayer of repentance: 'Our Lord hath extended mercy unto us in the
sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house
of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof (of our God), and to
give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.' The argument from this passage
lies not merely in the גּדר (encircling wall), but especially in this,
'to repair the desolations thereof.' This could not be the desolations
of the temple, which had been long before this rebuilt, and therefore we
may understand by it the desolations of Jerusalem." But the strength of
this argumentation rests merely on a verbally free rendering of the
verse referred to ([Ezr 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#009).md). The
circumstance that Ezra speaks of the kings (in the plur.) of Persia, who
showed favour to the Jews, indicates that he meant not merely that which
Artaxerxes had done and would yet do in the future, but that he refers
also to the manifestation of favour on the part of kings Cyrus, Darius
Hystaspes, and Artaxerxes; thus also the expression, "to give us a
wall," cannot refer to the permission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,
which Artaxerxes some years later first granted to Nehemiah. Moreover,
the expression, "to give us a גּדר in Judah and Jerusalem," shows that
by גּדר cannot be understood the fortified walls of Jerusalem; for גּדר
never denotes the walls of a city or fortress as such, but always only
the encompassing wall of a vineyard, which meaning is found in [Mic
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011.md); [Eze
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005.md). גּדר is therefore to be
understood here figuratively: encompassing wall in the sense of divine
protection; and the meaning is not this: "that the place protected by
the wall lies in Judah and Jerusalem; but in Judah and Jerusalem the
Persian kings have given to the new congregation of the people a secure
dwelling-place, because the power of the Persian kings secured to the
Israelites who had returned from captivity the undisturbed and continued
possession of their land" (Bertheau). The objection also, that חרבתיו
cannot be the ruins of the temple, because it was already built, is set
aside as soon as we express the infinitive להעמיד, as it is rightly
done, by the praeterite, whereby this word refers to the completed
building of the temple. Cf. with this Hengstenberg's extended refutation
of this argument of Auberlen's (Christol. iii. 1, p. 144).)

If the clause, "from the going forth of the commandment," etc., cannot
refer to the edict of Cyrus, because in it there is no express mention
made of the rebuilding of Jerusalem, so also, for the same reason, it
cannot refer to that which was issued by Artaxerxes in favour of Ezra.
Auberlen's remark, however, is correct, when he says that the edict
relating to Nehemiah is of secondary importance when compared with that
relating to Ezra. Strictly speaking, there is no mention made of an
edict relating to Nehemiah. Nehemiah, as cup-bearer of Artaxerxes,
entreated of the king the favour of being sent to Judah, to the city of
his fathers' sepulchres, that he might build it; and the king (the queen
also sitting by him) granted him this request, and gave him letters to
all the governors on this side the Euphrates, that they should permit
him undisturbed to prosecute his journey, and to the overseers of the
royal forests, that they should give him wood "for the gates of the
palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city"
([Neh 2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#004).md). However important this
royal favour was in its consequences for Jerusalem, - for Nehemiah built
the walls of the city, and thereby raised Jerusalem to a fortified city
guarded against hostile assaults, - yet the royal favour for this
undertaking was not such as to entitle it to be designated as 'מצא דצר
וגו, a going forth of a commandment of God. But if, in favour of the
reference of דּבר מצא to the edict of Ezra, Auberlen (p. 128ff.)
attaches special importance to the circumstance that in the books of
Ezra and Nehemiah are recorded two periods of post-exilian history, the
first of which - namely, the time of Zerubbabel and of the high priest
Joshua under Cyrus and Darius Hystaspes - we may designate the period of
the building of the temple, the second - namely, the time of Ezra the
priest, and Nehemiah the Tirshatha, under Artaxerxes Longimanus - we may
designate the period of the restoration of the people and the building
of the city, - the former the time of the religious, and the latter that
of the political restoration; and, in seeking to establish this view, he
interprets the first part of the book of Ezra as a whole in itself, and
the second as a whole taken in combination with the book of Nehemiah; -
if this is his position, then Hengstenberg has already (Christol. iii.
p. 149) shown the incorrectness of this division of the book of Ezra,
and well remarks that the whole book of Ezra has the temple as its
central-point, and views with reference to it the mission of Ezra as
well as that of Zerubbabel and Joshua. There is certainly an inner
connection of the mission of Ezra with that of Nehemiah, but it consists
only in this, that Ezra's religious reformation was secured by
Nehemiah's political reform. From the special design of the work of
Ezra, to describe the restoration of the temple and of the service of
God, we must also explain the circumstance that nothing is said in it of
the building of the city of Jerusalem. Besides, this building, before
Nehemiah's arrival in Judah, had not further advanced than to the
re-erection of houses for the returned exiles who had settled in
Jerusalem. Every attempt to restore the walls was hindered and
frustrated by the enemies of Judah, so that the gates and the walls were
yet lying burnt and in ruins on Nehemiah's arrival ([Neh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md); [Neh
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003.md), [Neh
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#005).md). Therefore neither the absence of
any mention in the decree of Cyrus of the building of the city, nor the
fact that the rebuilding of the city walls was first effected by
Nehemiah, forms a decisive argument against the reference of וגו דּבר
מצא to this edict; and we must maintain this reference as the only
correct one, because this edict only, but not that which gave permission
to Ezra or that which gave authority to Nehemiah to build the city
walls, formed an epoch marking a crisis in the development of the
theocracy, as this is connected in the announcement of Gabriel with the
going forth of the word to restore Jerusalem.

Not less doubtful is the matter of the definition of the terminus ad
quem of the seventy שׁבעים, and of the chronological reckoning of the
whole period. As for the terminus ad quem, a sharply defined factum must
form the conclusion of the sixty-ninth week; for at this point the
public appearance of Christ, His being anointed with the Holy Ghost, is
named as the end of the prophecy. If this factum occurred, according to
[Luk 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md), in the year of Rome 782, the
twentieth year of Artaxerxes - i.e., the year 455 b.c., according to the
usual chronology - would be the year 299 A.U.C.; if we add to that
sixty-nine weeks = 483 years, then it gives the year 782 A.U.C. In the
middle of this last week, beginning with the appearance of the Anointed,
occurred His death, while the confirming of the covenant extends through
the whole of it. With reference to the death of Christ, the prophecy and
its fulfilment closely agree, since that event took place three and a
half years after His baptism. But the terminus ad quem of the confirming
of the covenant, as one more or less moveable, is capable of no definite
chronological determination. It is sufficient to remark, that in the
first years after the death of Christ the ἐκλογή of the Old Covenant
people was gathered together, and then the message of Christ was brought
also to the heathen, so that the prophet might rightly represent the
salvation as both subjectively and objectively consummated at the end of
the seventy weeks for the covenant people, of whom alone he speaks
(Hgst. pp. 163f., 180). Thus also Auberlen, who, however, places the end
of the seventy weeks in the factum of the stoning of Stephen, with which
the Jews pressed, shook down, and made full to the overflowing the
measure of their sins, already filled by the murder of the Messias; so
that now the period of grace yet given to them after the work of Christ
had come to an end, and the judgment fell upon Israel.

We will not urge against the precise accuracy of the fulfilment arrived
at by this calculation, that the terminus a quo adopted by Hengstenberg,
viz., The twentieth year of Artaxerxes, coincides with the 455th year
b.c. only on the supposition that Xerxes reigned but eleven years, and
that Artaxerxes came to the throne ten years earlier than the common
reckoning, according to which Xerxes reigned twenty-one years, and that
the correctness of this view is opposed by Hofm., Kleinert, Wieseler,
and others, because the arguments for and against it are evenly
balanced; but with Preiswerk, whose words Auberlen (p. 144) quotes with
approbation, considering the uncertainty of ancient chronology on many
points, we shall not lay much stress on calculating the exact year, but
shall regard the approximate coincidence of the prophetical with the
historical time as a sufficient proof that there may possibly have been
an exact correspondence in the number of years, and that no one, at all
events, can prove the contrary. But we must attach importance to this,
that in this calculation a part of the communication of the angel is
left wholly out of view. The angel announces not merely the cutting off
of the Messias after seven and sixty-two weeks, but also the coming of
the people of a prince who shall lay waste the city and the sanctuary,
which all interpreters who understand משׁיח יכּרת of the death of Christ
refer to the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple by the Romans;
he also says that this war shall last till the end of the seventy weeks.
The destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans followed the death of Christ,
not after an interval of only three and a half years, but of thirty
years. Accordingly, the seventy weeks must extend to the year 70 a.d.,
whereby the whole calculation is shown to be inaccurate. If we yet
further remark, that the advocates of this exposition of the prophecy
are in a position to give no sufficient reason for the dividing of the
sixty-nine weeks into seven and sixty-two, and that their reference of
the seven weeks to the time of the rebuilding of Jerusalem under
Nehemiah, and of the sixty-two weeks to the period from the completion
of this building to the appearance of Christ in the flesh, stands in
open contradiction to the words of the text; finally, that the placing
of the twentieth year of Artaxerxes as the terminus a quo of the
reckoning of the דּבר מצא cannot be correct, - then may we also regard
the much commended exact concord of the prophecy with the actual events
of history derived from this interpretation of the verse as only an
illusion, since from the "going forth of the word" to restore Jerusalem
to the destruction of that city by Titus, not seventy weeks or 490 years
elapsed, but, according as we date the going forth of this word in the
year 536 or 455 b.c., 606 or 525 years, i.e., more than eighty-six, or
at least seventy-five, year-weeks, passed. This great gulf, which thus
shows itself in the calculation of the שׁבעים as year-weeks, between the
prophecy and its chronological fulfilment, is not bridged over by the
remark with which Auberlen (p. 141) has sought to justify his
supposition that Ezra's return to Judah in the year 457 b.c. formed the
terminus a quo of the seventy weeks, while yet the word of the angel
announcing the restoration and the building up of Jerusalem first finds
its actual accomplishment in the building of the city walls on
Nehemiah's return - the remark, namely, that the external building up of
the city had the same relation to the terminus a quo of Daniel's seventy
year-weeks as the external destruction of Jerusalem to that of
Jeremiah's seventy years. "The latter begin as early as the year 606
b.c., and therefore eighteen years before the destruction of Jerusalem,
for at that time the kingdom of Judah ceased to exist as an independent
theocracy; the former begin thirteen years before the rebuilding of the
city, because then the re-establishment of the theocracy began." We find
a repetition of the same phenomenon at the end of the seventy weeks.
"These extend to the year 33 a.d. From this date Israel was at an end,
though the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans did not take place
till the year 70 a.d." For Jeremiah did not prophesy that the
destruction of Jerusalem should last for seventy years, but only that
the land of Judah would be desolate seventy years, and that for so long
a time its inhabitants would serve the king of Babylon. The desolating
of the land and Judah's subjugation to the king of Babylon did not begin
with the destruction of Jerusalem, but with the first siege of the city
by Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, i.e., in the year 606
b.c., and continued till the liberation of the Jews from Babylonian
bondage by Cyrus in the first year of his reign, in the year 536 b.c.,
and thus after seventy years were fully accomplished. Jeremiah's
chronologically definite prophecy is thus accurately fulfilled; but
Daniel's prophecy of the seventy weeks is neither chronologically
defined by years, nor has it been altogether so fulfilled as that the
70, 7, 52, and 1 week can be reckoned by year-weeks.

The New Testament also does not necessitate our seeking the end of the
seventy weeks in the judgment the Romans were the means of executing
against the ancient Jerusalem, which had rejected and crucified the
Saviour. Nowhere in the N.T. is this prophecy, particularly the משׁיח
יכּרת, referred to the crucifixion of our Lord; nor has Christ or the
apostles interpreted these verses, 26, 27 of this chapter, of the
desolation and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. However
general the opinion may be that Christ, in speaking of His παρουσία,
Matt 24; [Mar 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md), and Luke 21, in
the words ὅταν ἴδητε τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως τὸ ῥηθὲν Δανιὴλ τοῦ
προφήτου κ.τ.λ. ([Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md), cf. [Mar
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014).md), had before His eyes this
prophecy ([Dan 9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md), yet that
opinion is without foundation, and is not established by the arguments
which Hvernick (Daniel p. 383f.), Wieseler (die 70 Wochen, p. 173ff.),
Hengstenberg (Beitr. i. p. 258f., and Christol. iii. 1, p. 113f.), and
Auberlen (Daniel p. 120f.) have brought forward for that purpose. We
have already, in explaining the words שׁקּוּצים כּנף על, [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), shown that the βδέλυγμα τῆς
ἐρημώσεως, found in the discourse of Christ, is not derived from [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), but from [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md) or [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), where the lxx have rendered
משׁמם שׁקּוּץ by τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως. For the further confirmation
of the arguments in behalf of this view there presented, we wish to add
the following considerations. The appeal to the fact that Josephus, in
the words (Antt. x. 11. 7) Δανιῆλος καὶ περὶ τὴς τῶν ̔Ρηωμαίων ἡγεμονίας
ἀνέγραψε καὶ ὅτι ὑπ ̓αὐτῶν ἐρημωθήσεται, referred to the prophecy Daniel
9, and gave this interpretation not only as a private view of his own,
but as (cf. De Bell. Jud. iv. 6. 3) παλαιὸς λόγος ἀνδρῶν, i.e.,
represented the view of his people, as commonly received, even by the
Zealots, - this would form a valid proof that Daniel 9 was at that time
commonly referred to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, only,
however, if besides this no other prophecy of the book of Daniel could
be apparently referred to the destruction of the Jewish state by the
Romans. But this is not the case. Josephus and his contemporaries could
find such a prophecy in that of the great enemy ([Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025).md) who would arise out of the
fourth or Roman world-kingdom, and would persecute and destroy the
saints of the Most High. What Josephus adduces as the contents of the
παλαιὸς λόγος ἀνδρῶν, namely, τότε τῆν πόλιν ἁλώσεσθαι καὶ
καταφλεγήσεσθαι τὰ ἅγια νόμῳ πολέμου, occurs neither in Daniel 9 nor in
any other part of the book of Daniel, and was not so defined till after
the historical fulfilment. Wieseler, indeed, thinks (p. 154) that the
words τὴν πόλιν καταφλεγήσεσθαι κ.τ.λ., perfectly correspond with the
words of Daniel, ישׁחית והקּדשׁ והעיר, [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) (shall destroy the city and the
sanctuary, E. V.); but he also concedes that Josephus interpreted the
kind of desolation, perhaps with reference to [Dan
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033) (? 31.md), after the result, as a
total desolation. It is thus granted that not only in Daniel 9, but also
in Daniel 11, Daniel predicted a desolation of the city and the
sanctuary which could be interpreted of their destruction by the Romans,
and the opinion, that besides Daniel 9, no other part of Daniel can be
found, is abandoned as incorrect. But the other circumstances which
Josephus brings forward in the passage quoted, particularly that the
Zealots by the desecration of the temple contributed to the fulfilling
of that παλαιὸς λόγος, are much more distinctly contained in [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md) than in [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), where we must first introduce
this sense in the words ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md) כּ
נף שׁקּוּצים משׁמם על (on the wing of abominations one causing
desolation). Similarly the other passages are constituted in which
Josephus speaks of ancient prophecies which have been fulfilled in the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. No one specially points to
Daniel 9.

But if the proof from Josephus could be made more valid than has yet
been done, that the Jews of his time referred Daniel 9 to the overthrow
of the Jewish commonwealth by the Romans, yet thereby it would not be
proved that Christ also shared this Jewish opinion, and set it forth in
His discourse, Matt 24, as an undoubted truth. In favour of this view it
has indeed been argued, "that the ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ fully corresponds to ἐπὶ
τὸ ἱερὸν βδέλυγμα τῶν ἐρημώσεων ἔσται (lxx, [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md):" Hengstenberg, Christol. p.
117. But it is still more inconsistent with the proof from the
Alexandrian translation of the verses before us than it is with that
from Josephus. In the form of the lxx text that has come down to us
there are undoubtedly two different paraphrases or interpretations of
the Hebrew text off [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) penetrating each other, and
therein the obscure words of Daniel (after [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md) and [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011).md) are so interpreted that they
contain a reference to the desolation of the sanctuary by Antiochus.

(Note: That the Septuagint version ([Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md); [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md); [Dan
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md) is not in reality a
translation, but rather an explanation of the passage as the lxx
understood it, is manifest. "They regard," as Klief. rightly judges,
"[Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md) and the first half of [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) as teaching that it was
prophesied to Daniel that Israel would soon return from exile, that
Daniel also would return, and Jerusalem be built. The rest they treat
very freely. They take the second half of [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) out of its place, and insert it
after the first clause of [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md);
they also take the closing words of [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) out of their place, and insert
them after the second clause of [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md). The passage thus arranged they
then interpret of Antiochus Epiphanes. They add together call the
numbers they find in the text (70 + 7 + 62 = 139), and understand by
them years, the years of the Seleucidan aera, so that they descend to
the second year of Antiochus Epiphanes. Then they interpret all the
separate statements of the times and actions of Antiochus Epiphanes in a
similar manner as do the modern interpreters. C. Wieseler, p. 200 .")

The על כנף , incomprehensible to the translators, they interpreted after
the חלּלוּ, [Dan 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md), and derived
from it the ἐπὶ τὸ ἱερὸν. But Christ derived the expression τὸ βδέλυγμα
τῆς ἐρημώσεως as well as the ἐστὼς ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ from [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md), cf. with [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), but not from [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), where neither the original text,
"on the wings of abomination shall the desolater come," nor the lxx
translation, ἐπὶ τὸ ἱερὸν βδέλυγμα τῶν ἐρημώσεων ἔσται - "over the
sanctuary shall the abomination of the desolations come," leads to the
idea of a "standing," or a "being placed," of the abomination of
desolation. The standing (ἐστώς) without doubt supposes the placing,
which corresponds to the ונתנוּ (δώσουσι, lxx), and the ולתת (ἑτοιμασθῇ
δοθῆναι, lxx), and the ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ points to המקדּשׁ, [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md), since by the setting up of the
abomination of desolation, the sanctuary, or the holy place of the
temple, was indeed desecrated.

The prophecy in Daniel 11 treats, as is acknowledged, of the desolation
of the sanctuary by Antiochus Epiphanes. If thus the Lord, in His
discourse, had spoken of the βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρ. ἑστὼς ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίω

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

as a sign of the approaching destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, it would
not remotely follow that He referred this prophecy (Daniel 9) to that
catastrophe. Much more would He then, as Kliefoth (p. 412) has well
remarked, "represent that which Antiochus Epiphanes did against
Jerusalem as an historical type of that which the Romans would do." He
would only say, "As once was done to Jerusalem by Antiochus, according
to the word of Daniel, so shall it again soon be done; and therefore, it
ye see repeating themselves the events which occurred under Antiochus in
the fulfilment of Daniel's word, then know ye that it is the time for
light." But regarding the meaning which Christ found in [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) and [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), not the least intimation would
follow therefrom.

But in the discourse in question the Lord prophesied nothing whatever
primarily or immediately of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans,
but treated in it, as we have already remarked, generally of His
παρουσία and the συντέλεια τοῦ αἰῶνος, which He places only in
connection with the destruction of the temple. The occasion of the
discourse, as well as its contents, show this. After He had let the
temple, never to enter it again, shortly before His last sufferings,
while standing on the Mount of Olives, He announces to His disciples,
who pointed to the temple, the entire destruction of that building;
whereupon they say to Him, "Tell us πότε ταῦτα ἔσται καὶ τί τὸ σημεῖον
τῆς σῆς παρουσίας καὶ συντελείας τοῦ αἰῶνος?" for they believe that this
destruction and His παρουσία take place together at the end of the
world. This question the Lord replies to in a long discourse, in which
He gives them the wished-for information regarding the sign (σημεῖον,
Matt 24:4-31), and regarding the time (πότε) of His παρουσία and the end
of the world ([Mat 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032).md). The
information concerning the sign begins with a warning to take heed and
beware of being deceived; for that false messiahs would appear, and wars
and tumults of nations rising up one against another, and other plagues,
would come ([Mat 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#004).md). All this would
be only the beginning of the woes, i.e., of the affliction which then
would come upon the confessors of His name; but the end would not come
till the gospel was first preached in all the world as a testimony to
all nations ([Mat 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#008).md). Then He
speaks of the signs which immediately precede the end, namely, of the
abomination of desolation in the holy place of which Daniel prophesied.
With this a period of tribulation would commence such as never yet had
been, so that if these days should not be shortened for the elect's
sake, no one would be saved ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).md). To this He adds, in
conclusion, the description of His own παρουσία, which would immediately
(εὐθέως) follow this great tribulation ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md). He connects with the
description of His return ([Mat 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032).md)
a similitude, with which He answers the question concerning its time,
and thus continues: "When ye see all these things, know that it is near,
even at the doors. Verily I say unto you, this γενεά shall not pass till
all these things be fulfilled. But of that day and hour knoweth no man,
no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only" ([Mat
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#033.md), [Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034.md), [Mat
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036).md).

From this brief sketch of the course of the thought it clearly appears
that the Lord speaks expressly neither of the destruction of Jerusalem,
nor yet of the time of that event. What is to be understood by βδέλυγμα
τ. ἐρ He supposes to be known to the disciples from the book of Daniel,
and only says to them that they must flee when they see this standing in
the holy place, so that they may escape destruction ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).md). Only in Luke is there distinct
reference to the destruction of Jerusalem; for there we find, instead of
the reference to the abomination of desolation, the words, "And when ye
shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that its ἐρήμωσις
is nigh" ([Luk 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020).md). According to
the record of all the three evangelists, however, the Lord not only
connects in the closest manner the tribulation commencing with the
appearance of the βδέλυγμα τ. ἐρ, or with the siege of Jerusalem, with
the last great tribulation which opens the way for His return, but He
also expressly says, that immediately after the tribulation of those
days ([Mat 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md), or in those days of
that tribulation ([Mar 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024).md), or then
(τότε, [Luk 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#027).md), the Son of man
shall come in the clouds in great power and glory. From this close
connection of His visible παρουσία with the desolation of the holy place
or the siege of Jerusalem, it does not, it is true, follow that "by the
oppression of Jerusalem connected with the παρουσία, and placed
immediately before it, the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans cannot
possibly be meant;" much rather that the discourse is "of a desecration
and an oppression by Antichrist which would come upon the τόπος ἅγιος
and Jerusalem in the then future time, immediately before the return of
the Lord, in the days of the θλῖπσις μεγάλη" (Kliefoth). But just as
little does it follow from that close connection - as the eschatological
discourse, Matt 24, is understood by most interpreters - that the Lord
Himself, as well as His disciples, regarded as contemporaneous the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans and His visible return in the
last days, or saw as in prophetic perspective His παρουσία behind the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and thus, without regard to the
sequence of time, spoke first of the one event and then of the other.
The first conclusion is inadmissible for this reason, that the disciples
had made inquiry regarding the time of the destruction of the temple
then visibly before them. If the Lord, in His answer to this question,
by making mention of the βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρ. ἑστὼς ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίω, had no
thought of this temple, but only of the τόπος ἅγιος of the future, the
temple of the Christian church, then by the use of words which the
disciples could not otherwise understand than of the laying waste and
the desolation of the earthly sanctuary He would have confirmed them in
their error. The second conclusion is out of harmony with the whole
course of thought in the discourse. Besides, both of them are decidedly
opposed by this, that the Lord, after setting forth all the events which
precede and open the way for His παρουσία and the end of the world, says
to the disciples, "When ye see all these things, know that it is near,
even at the doors" ([Mat 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#033).md), and
solemnly adds, "This γενεά," i.e., the generation then living, "shall
not pass till all these things be fulfilled" ([Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034).md). Since the πάντα ταῦτα in [Mat
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#033.md) comprehends all that goes before
the παρουσία, all the events mentioned in [Mat
24:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md), or rather in Matt 24:5-28,
it must be taken also in the same sense in [Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034.md). If, therefore, the
contemporaries of Jesus and His disciples - for we can understand
nothing else by ἡ γενεὰ αὕτη - must live to see all these events, then
must they have had a commencement before the destruction of Jerusalem,
and though not perfectly, yet in the small beginnings, which like a germ
comprehended in them the completion. Hence it is beyond a doubt that the
Lord speaks of the judgment upon Jerusalem and the Jewish temple as the
beginning of His παρουσία and of the συντέλεια τοῦ αἰῶνος, not merely as
a pre-intimation of them, but as an actual commencement of His coming to
judgment, which continues during the centuries of the spread of the
gospel over the earth; and when the gospel shall be preached to all
nations, then the season and the hour kept in His own power by the
Father shall reach its completion in the ἐπιφανείᾳ τῆς παρουσίας αὐτοῦ
([Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008).md) to judge the world.

(Note: This view of the parousia of Christ has been controverted by Dr.
A. Christiani in his Bemerkungen zur Auslegung der Apocalypse mit
besonderer Rcksicht auf die chiliastische Frage (Riga 1868, p. 21), -
only, however, thus, that notwithstanding the remark, "Since the words
πάντα ταῦτα, [Mat 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034.md), plainly refer
back to [Mat 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#033.md), they cannot in the
one place signify more than in the other," he yet refers these words in
[Mat 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034.md) to the event of the
destruction of Jerusalem, because the contemporaries of Jesus in reality
lived to see it; thus giving to them, as they occur in [Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034.md), a much more limited sense than
that which they have in [Mat 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#033)..md)

According to this view, Christ, in His discourse, interpreted the
prophecy of Daniel, Daniel 11, of the abomination of desolation which
should come, and had come, upon Jerusalem and Judah by Antiochus
Epiphanes, as a type of the desolation of the sanctuary and of the
people of God in the last time, wholly in the sense of the prophecy,
which in [Mat 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036.md) passes over from
the typical enemy of the saints to the enemy of the people of God in the
time of the end.

Thus the supposition that Christ referred [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) and [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) to the overthrow of Jerusalem by
the Romans loses all support; and for the chronological reckoning of the
seventy weeks of Daniel, no help is obtained from the New Testament.

We have now to take into consideration the second view regarding the
historical reference of the seventy weeks prevailing in our time. The
opponents of the genuineness of the book of Daniel generally are agreed
in this (resting on the supposition that the prophecies of Daniel do not
extend beyond the death of Antiochus Epiphanes), that the destruction of
this enemy of the Jews (Ant. Ep.), or the purification of the temple
occurring a few years earlier, forms the terminus ad quem of the seventy
weeks, and that their duration is to be reckoned from the year 168 or
172 b.c. back either to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans,
or to the beginning of the Exile. Since now the seventy year-weeks or
490 years, reckoned from the year 168 or 172 b.c., would bring us to the
year 658 or 662 b.c., i.e., fifty-two or fifty-six years before the
commencement of the Exile, and the terminus a quo of Jeremiah's prophecy
of seventy years, a date from which cannot be reckoned any commencing
period, they have for this reason sought to shorten the seventy weeks.
Hitzig, Ewald, Wieseler, and others suppose that the first seven
year-weeks (= forty-nine years) are not to be taken into the reckoning
along with the sixty-two weeks, and that only sixty-two weeks = 434
years are to be counted to the year 175 (Ewald), or 172 (Hitzig), as the
beginning of the last week filled up by the assault of Antiochus against
Judaism. But this reckoning also brings us to the year 609 or 606 b.c.,
the beginning of the Exile, or three years further back. To date the
sixty-two year-weeks from the commencement of the Exile, agrees
altogether too little with the announcement that from the going forth of
the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem during sixty-two weeks
it shall be built, so that, of the most recent representatives of this
view, no one any longer consents to hold the seventy years of the exile
for a time of the restoring and the building of Jerusalem. Thus Hitzig
and Ewald openly declare that the reckoning is not correct, that the
pseudo-Daniel has erred, and has assumed ten weeks, i.e., seventy years,
too many, either from ignorance of chronology, "or from a defect in
thought, from an interpretation of a word of sacred Scripture, springing
from certain conditions received as holy and necessary, but not
otherwise demonstrable" (Ewald, p. 425). By this change of the sixty-two
weeks = 434 years into fifty-two weeks or 364 years, they reach from the
year 174 to 538 b.c., the year of the overthrow of Babylon by Cyrus, by
whom the word "to restore Jerusalem" was promulgated. To this the seven
weeks (= forty-nine years) are again added in order to reach the year
588 or 587 b.c., the year of the destruction of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar, from which the year-weeks, shortened from seventy to
sixty, are to be reckoned.

This hypothesis needs no serious refutation. For a reckoning which
places the first 7 weeks = 49 years aside, and then shortens the 62
weeks by 10 in order afterwards again to bring in the 7 weeks, can make
no pretence to the name of a "scientific explanation." When Hitzig
remarks (p. 170) "that the 7 weeks form the πρῶτον ψεῦδος in the
(Daniel's) reckoning, which the author must bring in; the whole theory
of the 70 year-weeks demands the earlier commencement in the year 606
b.c." - we may, indeed, with greater accuracy say that the πρῶτον ψεῦδος
of the modern interpretation, which needs such exegetical art and
critical violence in order to change the 70 and the 62 weeks into 60 and
52, arises out of the dogmatic supposition that the 70 weeks must end
with the consecration of the temple under Antiochus, or with the death
of this enemy of God.

Among the opponents of the genuineness of the book this supposition is a
dogmatic axiom, to the force of which the words of Scripture must yield.
But this supposition is adopted also by interpreters such as Hofmann,
Reichel (die 70 Jahreswochen [Dan
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), in the Theol. Stud. u. Krit.
1858, p. 735ff.), Fries, and others, who recognise the genuineness of
the book of Daniel, and hold the announcement of the angel in these
verses to be a divine revelation. These interpreters have adopted this
view for this reason, that in the description of the hostile prince who
shall persecute Israel and desecrate the sanctuary, and then come to his
end with terror ([Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md), they believe that they
recognise again the image of Antiochus Epiphanes, whose enmity against
the people and the sanctuary of God is described, [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md)., 23f. It cannot, it is true, be
denied that there is a certain degree of similarity between the two. If
in [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) it is said of the hostile prince
that he shall destroy the city and the sanctuary, and put an end to the
sacrifice and the meat-offering for half a week, then it is natural to
think of the enemy of whom it is said: he "shall destroy the mighty and
the holy people" (E. V. [Dan 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024).md),
"and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away" ([Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011).md), "and he shall take away the
daily sacrifice" ([Dan 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031).md),
especially if, with Hofmann, we adopt the view (Schriftbew. ii. 2, p.
592) that between the expressions "take away the daily sacrifice"
(התּמיד \[הסיר, remove\] הרים), and "he shall cause the sacrifice and
the oblation to cease" (וּמנחה זבח ישׁבית), there "is no particular
distinction."

(Note: We confine ourselves here to what Hofm. in his Schriftbew. has
brought forward in favour of this view, without going into the points
which he has stated in his die 70 Wochen, u. s. w. p. 97, but has
omitted in the Schriftbew., and can with reference to that earlier
argumentation only refer for its refutation to Kliefoth's Daniel, p.
417ff.)

But the predicate "particular" shows that Hofmann does not reject every
distinction; and, indeed, there exists a not inconsiderable distinction;
for, as we have already remarked, התּמיד denotes only that which is
permanent in worship, as e.g., the daily morning and evening sacrifice;
while, on the other hand, זבה וּמנחה denotes the whole series of
sacrifices together. The making to cease of the bloody and the unbloody
sacrifices expresses an altogether greater wickedness than the taking
away of the daily sacrifice. This distinction is not set aside by a
reference to the clause משׁמם שׁקּוּצים כּנף ועל ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md) compared with משׁמם השּׁקּוּץ
ונתנוּ ([Dan 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031).md). For the assertion
that the article in משׁמם השּׁקּוּץ ([Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md), "the abomination that maketh
desolate") denotes something of which Daniel had before this already
heard, supplies no proof of this; but the article is simply to be
accounted for from the placing over against one another of התּמיד and
השּׁקּוּץ. Moreover the משׁמם השּׁקּוּץ is very different from the משׁמם
שׁקּוּצים כּנף על. The being carried on the wings of idol-abominations
is a much more comprehensive expression for the might and dominion of
idol-abominations than the setting up of an idol-altar on Jehovah's
altar of burnt-offering.

As little can we (with Hofm., p. 590) perceive in the הבּא, closely
connecting itself with בּשׁטף וקצּו ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md), a reference to the divine
judgment described in Daniel 8, because the reference to the enemy of
God spoken of in [Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md), [Dan
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024.md) is as natural, yea, even more so,
when we observe that the enemy of God in Daniel 7 is destroyed by a
solemn judgment of God - a circumstance which harmonizes much more with
קצּו בשּׁטף than with ישּׁבר יד בּאפס, which is said of the enemy
described in Daniel 8. Add to this that the half-week during which the
adversary shall ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md) carry on
his work corresponds not to the 2300 evening-mornings ([Dan
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013).md), but, as Delitzsch acknowledges,
to the 3 1/2 times, [Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md) and [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md), which 3 1/2 times, however,
refer not to the period of persecution under Antiochus, but to that of
Antichrist.

From all this it therefore follows, not that the prince who shall come,
whose people shall destroy the city and the sanctuary, and who shall
cause the sacrifice to cease, is Antiochus, who shall raise himself
against the people of the saints, take away the "continuance" (= daily
sacrifice), and cast down the place of the sanctuary ([Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011).md), but only that this wickedness
of Antiochus shall constitute a type for the abomination of desolation
which the hostile prince mentioned in this prophecy shall set up, till,
like Pharaoh, he find his overthrow in the flood, and the desolation
which he causes shall pour itself upon him like a flood.

This interpretation of [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) is not made doubtful also by
referring to the words of 1 Macc. 1:54, ᾠκοδόμησαν βδέλυγμα ἐρημώσεως
ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, as an evidence that at that time [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) was regarded as a prophecy of the
events then taking place (Hofm. Weiss. i. p. 309). For these words refer
not to [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), where the lxx have
βδέλυγμα ἐρημώσεων, but to [Dan 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#011.md),
where the singular βδέλυγμα ἐρημώσεως stands with the verb καὶ δώσουσι
(lxx for ונתנוּ), to which the ᾠκοδομήσεται visibly refers.

If, therefore, the reference of [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) to the period of Antiochus'
persecution is exegetically untenable, then also, finally, it is
completely disproved in the chronological reckoning of the 70 weeks.
Proceeding from the right supposition, that after the 70 weeks, the
fulfilling of all that was promised, the expiating and putting away of
sin, and, along with that, the perfect working out of the divine plan of
salvation for eternity, shall begin - thus, that in [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md) the perfecting of the kingdom of
God in glory is prophesied of, - Hofmann and his followers do not
interpret the 7, 62, and 1 week which are mentioned in [Dan
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md) as a division of the 70 weeks,
but they misplace the first-mentioned 7 weeks at that end of the period
consisting of 70 such weeks, and the following 62 + 1 in the time
reaching from the beginning of the Chaldean supremacy in the year 605 to
the death of Antiochus Epiphanes in the year 164, which makes 441 years
= 63 year-weeks; according to which, not only the end of the 62 + 1
weeks does not coincide with the end of the 70 weeks, but also the 7 +
62 + 1 are to be regarded neither as identical with the 70 nor as
following one another continuously in their order, - much more between
the 63 and the 7 weeks a wide blank space, which before the coming of
the end cannot be measured, must lie, which is not even properly covered
up, much less filled up, by the remark that "the unfolding of the 70
proceeds backwards." For by this reckoning 7 + 62 + 1 are not an
unfolding of the 70, and are not equal to 70, but would be equal to 62 +
1 + some unknown intervening period + 7 weeks. This were an
impossibility which the representatives of this interpretation of the
angel's communication do not, it is true, accept, but seek to set aside,
by explaining the 7 weeks as periods formed of 7 times 7, or
jubilee-year periods, and, on the contrary, the 62 + 1 of seven-year
times of Sabbath-periods.

This strange interpretation of the angel's words, according to which not
only must the succession of the periods given in the text be transposed,
the first 7 weeks being placed last, but also the word שׁבעים in the
passages immediately following one another must first denote jubilee (49
year) periods, then also Sabbath-year (7 year) periods, is not made
plain by saying that "the end of the 62 + 1 week is the judgment of
wrath against the persecutor, thus only the remote making possible the
salvation; but the end of the 70 weeks is, according to [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), the final salvation, and
fulfilling of the prophecy and consecration of the Most Holy - thus the
end of the 62 + 1 and of the 70 does not take place at the same time;"
and - "if the end of the two took place at the same time, what kind of
miserable consolation would this be for Daniel, in answer to his prayer,
to be told that Jerusalem within the 70 weeks would in troublous times
again arise, thus only arise amid destitution!"' (Del. p. 284). For the
prophecy would furnish but miserable consolation only in this case, if
it consisted merely of the contents of [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), and [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), - if it said nothing more than
this, that Jerusalem should be built again within the 70 weeks in
troublous times, and then finally would again be laid waste. But the
other remark, that the judgment of wrath against the destroyer forms
only the remote making possible of the salvation, and is separated from
the final deliverance or the completion of salvation by a long
intervening period, stands in contradiction to the prophecy in Daniel 7
and to the whole teaching of Scripture, according to which the
destruction of the arch-enemy (Antichrist) and the setting up of the
kingdom of glory are brought about by one act of judgment.

In the most recent discussion of this prophecy, Hofmann (Schriftbew. ii.
2, p. 585ff., 2 Aufl.) has presented the following positive arguments
for the interpretation and reckoning of the period of time in question.
The message of the angel in [Dan
7:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025) consists of three parts: (1.md) A
statement of how many heptades shall be between the going forth of the
command to rebuild Jerusalem and a Maschiach Nagid; (2) the mentioning
of that which constitutes the contents of sixty-two of these periods;
(3) the prediction of what shall happen with the close of the latter of
these times. In the first of these parts, דּבר with the following
infinitive, which denotes a human action, is to be taken in the sense of
commandment, as that word of Cyrus prophesied of [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md), and the rebuilding of Jerusalem
is to be interpreted as in this passage of Isaiah, or in Jeremiah's
prophecy to the same import, and not as if afterwards a second
rebuilding of Jerusalem amid the difficulty and oppression of the times
is predicted; then will the sixty-two heptades remain separated from the
seven, and not sixty-nine of these, but only seven, be reckoned between
the going forth of the command to build Jerusalem again and the
Maschiach Nagid, since in [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md)
mention is made not of that which is to be expected on the other side of
the sixty-nine, but of the sixty-two times; finally, the contents of the
seven times are sufficiently denoted by their commencement and their
termination, and will remain without being confounded with the building
up of Jerusalem in troublous times, afterwards described.

All these statements of Hofmann are correct, and they agree with our
interpretation of these verses, but they contain no proof that the
sixty-two weeks are to be placed after the seven, and that they are of a
different extent from these. The proof for this is first presented in
the conclusion derived from these statements (on the ground of the
correct supposition that by Maschiach Nagid not Cyrus, but the Messias,
is to be understood), that because the first of these passages ([Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025).md) does not say of a part of these
times what may be its contents, but much rather points out which part of
them lies between the two events in the great future of Israel, and
consequently separates them from one another, that on this account these
events belong to the end of the present course of the world, in which
Israel hoped, and obviously the seven times shall constitute the end of
the period consisting of seven such times. This argument thus founds
itself on the circumstance that the appearing of the Maschiach Nagid
which concludes the seven weeks, and separates them from the sixty-two
weeks which follow, is not to be understood of the appearance of Christ
in the flesh, but of His return in glory for the completion of the
kingdom which was hoped for in consequence of the restoration of
Jerusalem, prophesied of by Isaiah (e.g., [Isa
55:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003).md) and Jeremiah (e.g., [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009).md). But we could speak of these
deductions as valid only if Isaiah and Jeremiah had prophesied only of
the appearance of the Messias in glory, with the exclusion of His coming
in the flesh. But since this is not the case - much rather, on the one
side, Hofmann himself says the וגו להשׁיב דּבר may be taken for a
prediction, as that [Isa 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md), of
Cyrus - but Cyrus shall not build the Jerusalem of the millennial
kingdom, but the Jerusalem with its temple which was destroyed by the
Chaldeans - and, on the other hand, here first, if not alone, in the
prophecies Jer. 25 and 29, by which Daniel was led to pray, Jeremiah has
predicted the return of Israel from exile after the expiry of the
seventy years as the beginning of the working out of the divine counsel
of salvation towards Israel, - therefore Daniel also could not
understand the וגו להשׁיב דּבר otherwise than of the restoration of
Jerusalem after the seventy years of the Babylonish exile. The remark
also, that nothing is said of the contents of the seven weeks, warrants
us in no respect to seek their contents in the time of the millennial
kingdom. The absence of any mention of the contents of the seven weeks
is simply and sufficiently accounted for from the circumstance, as we
have already shown, that Daniel had already given the needed information
(Daniel 8) regarding this time, regarding the time from the end of the
Exile to the appearance of Christ. Still less can the conclusion be
drawn, from the circumstance that the building in the sixty-two weeks is
designated as one falling in troublous times, that the restoration and
the building of Jerusalem in the seven weeks shall be a building in
glory. The ולבנות להשׁיב (to restore and to build, [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025).md) does not form a contrast to the
העתּים וּבצוק ונבנתה תּשׁוּב (= E.V. shall be built again, and the wall
even in troublous times, [Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025).md),
but it is only more indefinite, for the circumstances of the building
are not particularly stated. Finally, the circumstance also, that after
the sixty-two heptades a new devastation of the holy city is placed in
view, cannot influence us to escape from the idea of the second coming
of Christ in the last time along with the building of Jerusalem during
the seven heptades, since it was even revealed to the prophet that not
merely would a cruel enemy of the saints of God (in Antiochus Epiphanes)
arise out of the third world-kingdom, but also that a yet greater enemy
would arise out of the fourth, an enemy who would perish in the burning
fire ([Dan 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#012.md), [Dan
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026)..md) in the judgment of the world
immediately before the setting up of the kingdom of glory.

Thus neither the placing of the contents of the seven weeks in the
eschatological future, nor yet the placing of these weeks at the
beginning instead of at the end of the three periods of time which are
distinguished in [Dan 9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), is
established by these arguments. This Fries (Jahrb.f. deutsche Theol. iv.
p. 254ff.) has observed, and rightly remarked, that the effort to
interpret the events announced in [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md). of the tyranny of Antiochus, and
to make this epoch coincide with the close of the sixty-two year-weeks
in the chronological reckoning, cannot but lead to the mistake of
including the years of Babylon in the seventy year-weeks - a mistake
which is met by three rocks, against which every attempt of this kind
must be shattered. (1) There is the objection that it is impossible that
the times of the destruction and the desolation of Jerusalem could be
conceived of under the same character as the times of its restoration,
and be represented from the same point of view; (2) the inexplicable
inconsequence which immediately arises, if in the seventy year-weeks,
including the last restoration of Israel, the Babylonish but not also
the Romish exile were comprehended; (3) the scarcely credible
supposition that the message of the angel sent to Daniel was to correct
that earlier divine word which was given by Jeremiah, and to make known
that not simply seventy years, but rather seventy year-weeks, are meant.
Of this latter supposition we have already shown that it has not a
single point of support in the text.

In order to avoid these three rocks, Fries advances the opinion that the
three portions into which the seventy year-weeks are divided, are each
by itself separately to be reckoned chronologically, and that they form
a connected whole, not in a chronological, but in a
historico-pragmatical sense, "as the whole of all the times of the
positive continuance of the theocracy in the Holy Land lying between the
liberation from Babylonish exile and the completion of the historical
kingdom of Israel"; and, indeed, so that the seven year-weeks, [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), form the last part of the
seventy year-weeks, or, what is the same, the jubilee-period of the
millennial kingdom, and the sixty-two year-weeks, [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), represent the period of the
restoration of Israel after its liberation from Babylon and before its
overthrow by the Romans - reckoned according to the average of the
points of commencement and termination, according to which, from the
reckoning 536 (edict of Cyrus), 457 (return of Ezra), and 410
(termination by the restoration), we obtain for the epoch of the
restoration the mean year 467 b.c.; and for the crisis of subjection to
the Roman power A.U.C. 691 (the overthrow of Jerusalem by Pompey), 714
(the appointment of Herod as king of the Jews), and 759 (the first Roman
procurator in Palestine), we obtain the mean year 721 A.U.C. = 33 b.c.,
and the difference of these mean numbers, 467 and 33, amounts exactly to
434 years = 62 year-weeks. The period described in v. 26 thus reaches
from the beginnings of the subjection of Israel under the Roman
world-kingdom to the expiry of the time of the diaspora of Israel, and
the separate year-week, v. 27, comprehends the period of the final trial
of the people of God, and reaches from the bringing back of Israel to
the destruction of Antichrist (pp. 261-2;66).

Against this new attempt to solve the mystery of the seventy weeks,
Hofmann, in Schriftbew. ii. 2, p. 594, raises the objection, "that in
[Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) a period must be described
which belongs to the past, and in [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), on the contrary, another which
belongs to the time of the end; this makes the indissoluble connection
which exists between the contents of the two verses absolutely
impossible." In this he is perfectly right. The close connection between
these two verses makes it certainly impossible to interpose an empty
space of time between the cutting off of the Anointed, by which Fries
understands the dispersion of Israel among the heathen in the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and the coming of Antichrist, a
space which would amount to 1800 years. But in opposition to this
hypothesis we must also further remark, (1) that Fries had not justified
the placing of the first portion of the seventy year-weeks (i.e., the
seven weeks) at the end, - he has not removed the obstacles standing
against this arbitrary supposition, for his interpretation of the words
נגיד משׁיח עד, "till Messias the prince shall be," is verbally
impossible, since, if Nagid is a predicate, then the verb יהיה could not
be wanting; (2) that the interpretation of the משׁיח יכּרת of the
abolition of the old theocracy, and of the dispersion of the Jews
abandoned by God among the heathen, needs no serious refutation, but
with this interpretation the whole hypothesis stands or falls. Finally,
(3) the supposition requires that the sixty-two weeks must be
chronologically reckoned as year-weeks; the seven weeks, on the
contrary, must be interpreted mystically as jubilee-periods, and the one
week as a period of time of indefinite duration; a freak of
arbitrariness exceeding all measure, which can on longer be spoken of as
scripture interpretation.

Over against such arbitrary hypotheses, we can regard it as only an
advance on the way toward a right understanding of this prophecy, that
Hofmann (p. 594) closes his most recent investigations into this
question with the following remarks: - "On the contrary, I always find
that the indefiniteness of the expression שׁבוּע, which denotes a period
in some way divided into sevens, leaves room for the possibility of
comprehending together the sixty-three and the seven weeks, in one
period of seventy, as its beginning and its end .... What was the extent
of the units of which the seventy times consist, the expression שׁבוּע
did not inform Daniel: he could only conjecture it." This facilitates
the adoption of the symbolical interpretation of the numbers, which,
after the example of Leyrer and Kliefoth, we regard as the only possible
one, because it does not necessitate our changing the seventy years of
the exile into years of the restoration oaf Jerusalem, and placing the
even weeks, which the text presents as the first period of the seventy
weeks, last.

The symbolical interpretation of the seventy שׁבעים and their divisions
is supported by the following considerations: - (1) By the double
circumstance, that on the one side all the explanations of them as
year-weeks necessitate an explanation of the angel's message which is
justified neither by the words nor by the succession of the statements,
and do violence to the text, without obtaining a natural progress of
thought, and on the other side all attempts to reckon these year-weeks
chronologically show themselves to be insufficient and impossible. (2)
The same conclusion is sustained by the choice of the word שׁבוּע for
the definition of the whole epoch and its separate periods; for this
word only denotes a space of time measured by sevens, but indicates
nothing as to the duration of these sevens. Since Daniel in [Dan
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md) and [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md) uses a chronologically definite
measure of time (evening-mornings, days), we must conclude from the
choice of the expressions, seven, seven times (as in [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md) and [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007) of the like expression, times.md),
which cannot be reckoned chronologically, that the period for the
perfecting of the people and the kingdom of God was not to be
chronologically defined, but only noted as a divinely appointed period
measured by sevens. "They are sevens, of that there is no doubt; but the
measure of the unit is not given:" thus Lmmert remarks (Zur Revision der
bibl. Zahlensymb. in den Jahrbb.f. D. Theol. ix. 1). He further says:
"If the great difficulty of taking these numbers chronologically does
not of itself urge to their symbolical interpretation, then we should be
led to this by the disagreement existing between Gabriel's answer ([Dan
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#022).md) and Daniel's question ([Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002).md). To his human inquiries regarding
the end of the Babylonish exile, Daniel receives not a human but a
divine answer, in which the seventy years of Jeremiah are reckoned as
sevens, and it is indicated that the full close of the history of
redemption shall only be reached after a long succession of periods of
development."

By the definition of these periods according to a symbolical measure of
time, the reckoning of the actual duration of the periods named is
withdrawn beyond the reach of our human research, and the definition of
the days and hours of the development of the kingdom of God down to its
consummation is reserved for God, the Governor of the world and the
Ruler of human history; yet by the announcement of the development in
its principal stadia, according to a measure fixed by God, the strong
consolation is afforded of knowing that the fortunes of His people are
in His hands, and that no hostile power will rule over them one hour
longer than God the Lord thinks fit to afford time and space, in regard
to the enemy for his unfolding and ripening for the judgment, and in
regard to the saints for the purifying and the confirmation of their
faith for the eternal life in His kingdom according to His wisdom and
righteousness.

The prophecy, in that it thus announces the times of the development of
the future consummation of the kingdom of God and of this world
according to a measure that is symbolical and not chronological, does
not in the least degree lose its character as a revelation, but thereby
first rightly proves its high origin as divine, and beyond the reach of
human thought. For, as Leyrer (Herz.'s Realenc. xviii. p. 387) rightly
remarks, "should not He who as Creator has ordained all things according
to measure and number, also as Governor of the world set higher measures
and bounds to the developments of history? which are to be taken at one
time as identical with earthly measures of time, which indeed the
eventus often first teaches (e.g., the seventy years of the Babylonish
exile, [Dan 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002).md), but at another time
as symbolical, but yet so that the historical course holds and moves
itself within the divinely measured sphere, as with the seventy weeks of
Daniel, wherein, for the establishing of the faith of individuals and of
the church, there lies the consolation, that all events even to the
minutest, particularly also the times of war and of oppression, are
graciously measured by God ([Jer 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022.md);
[Job 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011.md); [Psa
93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003)..md)."

(Note: Auberlen, notwithstanding that he interprets the seventy שׁבעים
chronologically as year-weeks, does not yet altogether misapprehend the
symbolical character of this definition of time, but rightly remarks (p.
133f.), "The history of redemption is governed by these sacred numbers;
they are like the simple foundation of the building, the skeleton in its
organism. These are not only outward indications of time, but also
indications of nature and essence." What he indeed says regarding the
symbolical meaning of the seventy weeks and their divisions, depends on
his erroneous interpretation of the prophecy of the appearance of Christ
in the flesh, and is not consistent with itself.)

To give this consolation to the faithful is the object of this
revelation, and that object it fully accomplishes. For the time and the
hour of the consummation of the kingdom of God it belongs not to us to
know. What the Lord said to His disciples ([Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007).md) before His ascension, in answer
to their question as to the time of the setting up of the kingdom of
Israel - "It belongs not to you to know χρόνους ἤ καιροὺς οὕς ὁ πατὴρ
ἔθετο ἐν τῇ Ἰδίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ "that He says not only to the twelve apostles,
but to the whole Christian world. That the reason for this answer is to
be sought not merely in the existing condition of the disciples at the
time He uttered it, but in this, that the time and the hour of the
appearance of the Lord for the judgment of the world and the completion
of His kingdom in glory are not to be announced beforehand to men, is
clear from the circumstance that Christ in the eschatological discourse
([Mat 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036.md); [Mar
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032).md) declares generally, "Of that
day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father
only." According to this, God, the Creator and Ruler of the world, has
kept in His own power the determination of the time and the hour of the
consummation of the world, so that we may not expect an announcement of
it beforehand in the Scripture. What has been advanced in opposition to
this view for the justifying of the chronological interpretation of
Daniel's prophecy of seventy weeks, and similar prophecies (cf. e.g.,
Hengstb. Christol. iii. 1, p. 202ff.), cannot be regarded as valid
proof. If Bengel, in Ordo Temporum, p. 259, 2nd ed., remarks with
reference to [Mar 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md) : "Negatur
praevia scientia, pro ipso duntaxat praesenti sermonis tempore, ante
passionem et glorificationem Jesu. Non dixit, nemo sciet, sed: nemo
scit. Ipse jam, jamque, sciturus erat: et quum scientiam diei et horae
nactus fuit, ipsius erat, scientiam dare, cui vellet et quando vellet,"
- so no one can certainly dispute a priori the conclusion "Ipse jam,"
etc., drawn from the correct statements preceding, but also every one
will confess that the statement "Ipsius erat," etc., cannot prove it to
be a fact that Jesus, after His glorification, revealed to John in
Patmos the time and the hour of His return for the final judgment.
Bengel's attempt to interpret the prophetical numbers of the Apocalypse
chronologically, and accordingly to reckon the year of the coming again
of our Lord, has altogether failed, as all modern scientific
interpreters have acknowledged. So also fails the attempt which has been
made to conclude from what Christ has said regarding the day of His
παρουσία, that the Scripture can have no chronologically defined
prophecies, while yet Christ Himself prophesied His resurrection after
three days.
