### [Leviticus Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001)

[Leviticus 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 23:1</span></span>

This chapter does not contain a "calendar of feasts," or a summary and
completion of the directions previously given in a scattered form
concerning the festal times of Israel, but simply a list of those festal
days and periods of the year at which holy meetings were to be held.
This is most clearly stated in the heading ([Lev
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002)): "the festal times of Jehovah,
which ye shall call out as holy meetings, these are they, My feasts,"
i.e., those which are to be regarded as My feasts, sanctified to Me. The
festal seasons and days were called "feasts of Jehovah," times appointed
and fixed by Jehovah (see [Gen 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014)),
not because the feasts belonged to fixed times regulated by the course
of the moon (Knobel), but because Jehovah had appointed them as days, or
times, which were to be sanctified to Him. Hence the expression is not
only used with reference to the Sabbath, the new moon, and the other
yearly feasts; but in [Num 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#002) and
[Num 29:39](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#039) it is extended so as to
include the times of the daily morning and evening sacrifice. (On the
"holy convocation" see [Exo 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016).)

[Leviticus 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 23:3</span></span>

At the head of these moadim stood the Sabbath, as the day which God had
already sanctified as a day of rest for His people, by His own rest on
the seventh creation-day ([Gen 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003),
cf. [Exo 20:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008)). On שׁבּתון שׁבּת,
see at [Exo 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#015) and [Exo
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#033). As a weekly returning day of
rest, the observance of which had its foundation in the creative work of
God, the Sabbath was distinguished from the yearly feasts, in which
Israel commemorated the facts connected with its elevation into a people
of God, and which were generally called "feasts of Jehovah" in the
stricter sense, and as such were distinguished from the Sabbath ([Lev
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#037), [Lev
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#038); [Isa
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013); [Ch1
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#031); [Ch2
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#003); [Neh
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#034)). This distinction is pointed
out in the heading, "these are the feasts of Jehovah" ([Lev
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004)).

(Note: Partly on account of his repetition, and partly because of the
supposed discrepancy observable in the fact, that holy meetings are not
prescribed for the Sabbath in the list of festal sacrifices in Num 28
and 29, Hupfield and Knobel maintain that the words of [Lev
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002) and [Lev
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003), from יהוה to מושׁבתיכם,
notwithstanding their Elohistic expression, were not written by the
Elohist, but are an interpolation of the later editor. The repetition of
the heading, however, cannot prove anything at all with the constant
repetitions that occur in the so-called Elohistic groundwork, especially
as it can be fully explained by the reason mentioned in the text. And
the pretended discrepancy rests upon the perfectly arbitrary assumption,
that Num 28 and 29 contain a complete codex of all the laws relating to
all the feasts. How totally this assumption is at variance with the
calendar of feasts, is clear enough from the fact, that no rule is laid
down there for the observance of the Sabbath, with the exception of the
sacrifices to be offered upon it, and that even rest from labour is not
commanded. Moreover Knobel is wrong in identifying the "holy
convocation" with a journey to the sanctuary, whereas appearance at the
tabernacle to hold the holy convocations (for worship) was not regarded
as necessary either in the law itself or according to the later orthodox
custom, but, on the contrary, holy meetings for edification were held on
the Sabbath in every place in the land, and it was out of this that the
synagogues arose.)

In [Num 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011) the feast of new moon
follows the Sabbath; but this is passed over here, because the new moon
was not to be observed either with sabbatical rest or a holy meeting.

[Leviticus 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 23:4</span></span>

[Lev 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004) contains the special heading
for the yearly feasts. בּמועדם at their appointed time.

[Lev 23:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005)

The leading directions for the Passover and feast of Mazzoth are
repeated from [Exo 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006), [Exo
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011), [Exo
12:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015). עבדה מלאכת, occupation of a
work, signifies labour at some definite occupation, e.g., the building
of the tabernacle, [Exo 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#024); [Exo
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001), [Exo
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#003); hence occupation in connection
with trade or one's social calling, such as agriculture, handicraft, and
so forth; whilst מלאכה is the performance of any kind of work, e.g.,
kindling fire for cooking food ([Exo
35:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#002)). On the Sabbath and the day of
atonement every kind of civil work was prohibited, even to the kindling
of fire for the purpose of cooking ([Lev
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003), [Lev
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#030), [Lev
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#031), cf. [Exo
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010); [Exo
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014); [Exo
35:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#002); [Deu
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#014) and [Lev
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029); [Num
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007)); on the other feast-days with a
holy convocation, only servile work ([Lev
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007), [Lev
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#008), [Lev
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#021), [Lev
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#025), [Lev
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#035), [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036), cf. [Exo
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016), and the explanation on [Lev
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001) :15ff., and [Num
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#018), [Num
28:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#025); [Num
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001), [Num
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012), [Num
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035)). To this there is appended a
fresh regulation in [Lev 23:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#009), with
the repetition of the introductory clause, "And the Lord spake," etc.
When the Israelites had come into the land to be given them by the Lord,
and had reaped the harvest, they were to bring a sheaf as first-fruits
of their harvest to the priest, that he might wave it before Jehovah on
the day after the Sabbath, i.e., after the first day of Mazzoth.
According to Josephus and Philo, it was a sheaf of barley; but this is
not expressly commanded, because it would be taken for granted in
Canaan, where the harvest began with the barley. In the warmer parts of
Palestine the barley ripens about the middle of April, and is reaped in
April or the beginning of May, whereas the wheat ripens two or three
weeks later (Seetzen; Robinson's Pal. ii. 263, 278). The priest was to
wave the sheaf before Jehovah, i.e., to present it symbolically to
Jehovah by the ceremony of waving, without burning any of it upon the
altar. The rabbinical rule, viz., to dry a portion of the ears by the
fire, and then, after rubbing them out, to burn them on the altar, was
an ordinance of the later scribes, who knew not the law, and was based
upon [Lev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014). For the law in [Lev
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014) refers to the offerings of
first-fruits made by private persons, which are treated of in [Num
18:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012), and [Deu
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002). The sheaf of first-fruits, on
the other hand, which was to be offered before Jehovah as a
wave-offering in the name of the congregation, corresponded to the two
wave-loaves which were leavened and then baked, and were to be presented
to the Lord as first-fruits ([Lev
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017)). As no portion of these
wave-loaves was burned upon the altar, because nothing leavened was to
be placed upon it ([Lev 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011)), but
they were assigned entirely to the priests, we have only to assume that
the same application was intended by the law in the case of the sheaf of
first-fruits, since the text only prescribes the waving, and does not
contain a word about roasting, rubbing, or burning the grains upon the
altar. השּׁבּת מחרת (the morrow after the Sabbath) signifies the next
day after the first day of the feast of Mazzoth, i.e., the 16th Abib
(Nisan), not the day of the Sabbath which fell in the seven days' feast
of Mazzoth, as the Baethoseans supposed, still less the 22nd of Nisan,
or the day after the conclusion of the seven days' feast, which always
closed with a Sabbath, as Hitzig imagines.

(Note: The view advocated by the Baethoseans, which has been lately
supported by W. Schultz, is refuted not only by [Jos
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#011), but by the definite article
used, השּׁבּת, which points back to one of the feast-days already
mentioned, and still more decisively by the circumstance, that according
to [Lev 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015) the seven weeks, at the
close of which the feast of Pentecost was to be kept, were to be
reckoned from this Sabbath; and if the Sabbath was not fixed, but might
fall upon any day of the seven days' feast of Mazzoth, and therefore as
much as give or six days after the Passover, the feast of Passover
itself would be forced out of the fundamental position which it occupied
in the series of annual festivals (cf. Ranke, Pentateuch ii. 108).
Hitzig's hypothesis has been revived by Hupfeld and Knobel, without any
notice of the conclusive refutation given to it by Bהhr and Wieseler;
only Knobel makes "the Sabbath" not the concluding but the opening
Sabbath of the feast of Passover, on the ground that "otherwise the
festal sheaf would not have been offered till the 22nd of the month, and
therefore would have come post festum." But this hypothesis, which
renders it necessary that the commencement of the ecclesiastical year
should always be assigned to a Saturday (Sabbath), in order to gain
weekly Sabbaths for the 14th and 21st of the month, as the opening and
close of the feast of Passover, gives such a form to the Jewish year as
would involve its invariably closing with a broken week; a hypothesis
which is not only incapable of demonstration, but, from the holiness
attached to the Jewish division of weeks, is a priori improbable, and in
fact inconceivable. The Mosaic law, which gave such sanctity to the
division of time into weeks, as founded upon the history of creation, by
the institution of the observance of the Sabbath, that it raised the
Sabbath into the groundwork of a magnificent festal cycle, could not
possibly have made such an arrangement with regard to the time for the
observance of the Passover, as would involve almost invariably the
mutilation of the last week of the year, and an interruption of the old
and sacred weekly cycle with the Sabbath festival at its close. The
arguments by which so forced a hypothesis is defended, must be very
conclusive indeed, to meet with any acceptance. But neither Hitzig nor
his followers have been able to adduce any such arguments as these.
Besides the word "Sabbath" and [Jos
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#011), which prove nothing at all, the
only other argument adduced by Knobel is, that "it is impossible to see
why precisely the second day of the azyma, when the people went about
their ordinary duties, and there was no meeting at the sanctuary, should
have been distinguished by the sacrificial gift which was the peculiar
characteristic of the feast," - an argument based upon the fallacious
principle, that anything for which I can see no reason, cannot possibly
have occurred.)

The "Sabbath" does not mean the seventh day of the week, but the day of
rest, although the weekly Sabbath was always the seventh or last day of
the week; hence not only the seventh day of the week ([Exo
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#015), etc.), but the day of atonement
(the tenth of the seventh month), is called "Sabbath," and "Shabbath
shabbathon" ([Lev 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#032); [Lev
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#031)). As a day of rest, on which no
laborious work was to be performed ([Lev
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#008)), the first day of the feast of
Mazzoth is called "Sabbath," irrespectively of the day of the week upon
which it fell; and "the morrow after the Sabbath" is equivalent to "the
morrow after the Passover" mentioned in [Jos
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#011), where "Passover" signifies the
day at the beginning of which the paschal meal was held, i.e., the first
day of unleavened bread, which commenced on the evening of the 14th, in
other words, the 15th Abib. By offering the sheaf of first-fruits of the
harvest, the Israelites were to consecrate their daily bread to the Lord
their God, and practically to acknowledge that they owed the blessing of
the harvest to the grace of God. They were not to eat any bread or
roasted grains of the new corn till they had presented the offering of
their God ([Lev 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014)). This offering
was fixed for the second day of the feast of the Passover, that the
connection between the harvest and the Passover might be kept in
subordination to the leading idea of the Passover itself (see at [Exo
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015).). But as the sheaf was not
burned upon the altar, but only presented symbolically to the Lord by
waving, and then handed over to the priests, an altar-gift had to be
connected with it, - namely, a yearling sheep as a burnt-offering, a
meat-offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil,
and a drink-offering of a quarter of a hin of wine, - to give expression
to the obligation and willingness of the congregation not only to enjoy
their earthly food, but to strengthen all the members of their body for
growth in holiness and diligence in good works. The burnt-offering, for
which a yearling lamb was prescribed, as in fact for all the regular
festal sacrifices, was of course in addition to the burnt-offerings
prescribed in [Num 28:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019), for every
feast-day. The meat-offering, however, was not to consist of one-tenth
of an ephah of fine flour, as on other occasions ([Exo
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040); [Num
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009), [Num
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#013), etc.), but of two-tenths, that
the offering of corn at the harvest-feast might be a more plentiful one
than usual.

[Leviticus 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 23:15</span></span>

The law for the special observance of the feast of Harvest ([Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016)) is added here without any fresh
introductory formula, to show at the very outset the close connection
between the two feasts. Seven whole weeks, or fifty days, were to be
reckoned from the day of the offering of the sheaf, and then the day of
first-fruits ([Num 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026)) or feast of
Weeks ([Exo 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022); [Deu
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#010)) was to be celebrated. From this
reckoning the feast received the name of Pentecost (ἡ πεντηκοστή, [Act
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001)). That שׁבּתות ([Lev
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015)) signifies weeks, like שׁבעות in
[Deu 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009), and τὰ σάββατα in the
Gospels (e.g., [Mat 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001)), is evident
from the predicate תּמימת, "complete," which would be quite unsuitable
if Sabbath-days were intended, as a long period might be reckoned by
half weeks instead of whole, but certainly not by half Sabbath-days.
Consequently "the morrow after the seventh Sabbath" ([Lev
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#016)) is the day after the seventh
week, not after the seventh Sabbath. On this day, i.e., fifty days after
the first day of Mazzoth, Israel was to offer a new meat-offering to the
Lord, i.e., made of the fruit of the new harvest ([Lev
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#010)), "wave-loaves" from its
dwellings, two of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour baked leavened,
like the bread which served for their daily food, "as first-fruits unto
the Lord," and of the wheat-harvest ([Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022)), which fell in the second half
of May and the first weeks of June (Robinson, Palestine), and therefore
was finished as a whole by the feast of Weeks. The loaves differed from
all the other meat-offerings, being made of leavened dough, because in
them their daily bread was offered to the Lord, who had blessed the
harvest, as a thank-offering for His blessing. They were therefore only
given to the Lord symbolically by waving, and were then to belong to the
priests ([Lev 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#020)). The injunction
"out of your habitations" is not to be understood, as Calvin and others
suppose, as signifying that every householder was to present two such
loaves; it simply expresses the idea, that they were to be loaves made
for the daily food of a household, and not prepared expressly for holy
purposes.

[Leviticus 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 23:18</span></span>

In addition to the loaves, they were to offer seven yearling lambs, one
young bullock, and two rams, as burnt-offerings, together with their
(the appropriate) meat and drink-offerings, one he-goat as a
sin-offering, and two yearling lambs as peace-offerings.

[Leviticus 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 23:20</span></span>

"The priest shall wave them (the two lambs of the peace-offerings),
together with the loaves of the first-fruits, as a wave-offering before
Jehovah; with the two lambs (the two just mentioned), they (the loaves)
shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest." In the case of the
peace-offerings of private individuals, the flesh belonged for the most
part to the offerer; but here, in the case of a thank-offering presented
by the congregation, it was set apart for the priest. The circumstance,
that not only was a much more bountiful burnt-offering prescribed than
in the offerings of the dedicatory sheaf at the commencement of harvest
([Lev 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#012)), but a sin-offering and
peace-offering also, is to be attributed to the meaning of the festival
itself, as a feast of thanksgiving for the rich blessing of God that had
just been gathered in. The sin-offering was to excite the feeling and
consciousness of sin on the part of the congregation of Israel, that
whilst eating their daily leavened bread they might not serve the leaven
of their old nature, but seek and implore from the Lord their God the
forgiveness and cleansing away of their sin. Through the increased
burnt-offering they were to give practical expression to their gratitude
for the blessing of harvest, by a strengthened consecration and
sanctification of all the members of the whole man to the service of the
Lord; whilst through the peace-offering they entered into that
fellowship of peace with the Lord to which they were called, and which
they were eventually to enjoy through His blessing in their promised
inheritance. In this way the whole of the year's harvest was placed
under the gracious blessing of the Lord by the sanctification of its
commencement and its close; and the enjoyment of their daily food was
also sanctified thereby. For the sake of this inward connection, the
laws concerning the wave-sheaf and wave-loaves are bound together into
one whole; and by this connection, which was established by reckoning
the time for the feast of Weeks from the day of the dedication of the
sheaf, the two feasts were linked together into an internal unity. The
Jews recognised this unity from the very earliest times, and called the
feast of Pentecost Azqereth (Greek, Ἀσαρθά), because it was the close of
the seven weeks (see at [Lev 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036);
Josephus, Ant. iii. 10).

(Note: A connection between the feast of Pentecost and the giving of the
law, which Maimonides (a.d. † 1205) was the first to discover, is not
only foreign to the Mosaic law, but to the whole of the Jewish
antiquity; and even Abarbanel expressly denies it.)

[Leviticus 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 23:21</span></span>

On this day a holy meeting was to be held, and laborious work to be
suspended, just as on the first and seventh days of Mazzoth. This was to
be maintained as a statute for ever (see [Lev
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014)). It was not sufficient,
however, to thank the Lord for the blessing of harvest by a feast of
thanksgiving to the Lord, but they were not to forget the poor and
distressed when gathering in their harvest. To indicate this, the law
laid down in [Lev 19:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#009) is repeated
in [Lev 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#022).

[Leviticus 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 23:23</span></span>

On the first day of the seventh month there was to be shabbathon, rest,
i.e., a day of rest (see [Exo 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#023)),
a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation, the suspension of
laborious work, and the offering of a firing for Jehovah, which are
still more minutely described in the calendar of festal sacrifices in
[Num 29:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#002). תּרוּעה, a joyful noise,
from רוּע to make a noise, is used in [Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024) for שׁופר תּרוּעה, a blast of
trumpets. On this day the shophar was to be blown, a blast of trumpets
to be appointed for a memorial before Jehovah ([Num
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010)), i.e., to call the congregation
into remembrance before Jehovah, that He might turn towards it His
favour and grace (see at [Exo 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#012),
[Exo 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#029); [Exo
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#016)); and from this the feast-day is
called the day of the trumpet-blast ([Num
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001)). Shophar, a trumpet, was a large
horn which produced a dull, far-reaching tone. Buccina pastoralis est et
cornu recurvo efficitur, unde et proprie hebraice sophar, graece
κερατίνη appellatur (Jerome on Hos. [Lev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#008)).

(Note: The word תּרוּעה is also used in [Num
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#005) to denote the blowing with the
silver trumpets; but there seems to be no ground for supposing these
trumpets to be intended here, not only because of the analogy between
the seventh day of the new moon as a jubilee day and the jubilee year
([Lev 25:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009)), but also because the
silver trumpets are assigned to a different purpose in [Num
10:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002), and their use is restricted
to the blowing at the offering of the burnt-offerings on the feast-days
and new moons. To this we have to add the Jewish tradition, which
favours with perfect unanimity the practice of blowing with horns (the
horns of animals).)

The seventh month of the year, like the seventh day of the week, was
consecrated as a Sabbath or sabbatical month, by a holy convocation and
the suspension of labour, which were to distinguish the first day of the
seventh month from the beginning of the other months or the other new
moon days throughout the year. For the whole month was sanctified in the
first day, as the beginning or head of the month; and by the sabbatical
observance of the commencement, the whole course of the month was raised
to a Sabbath. This was enjoined, not merely because it was the seventh
month, but because the seventh month was to secure to the congregation
the complete atonement for all its sins, and the wiping away of all the
uncleannesses which separated it from its God, viz., on the day of
atonement, which fell within this month, and to bring it a foretaste of
the blessedness of life in fellowship with the Lord, viz., in the feast
of Tabernacles, which commenced five days afterwards. This significant
character of the seventh month was indicated by the trumpet-blast, by
which the congregation presented the memorial of itself loudly and
strongly before Jehovah on the first day of the month, that He might
bestow upon them the promised blessings of His grace, for the
realization of His covenant. The trumpet-blast on this day was a prelude
of the trumpet-blast with which the commencement of the year of jubilee
was proclaimed to the whole nation, on the day of atonement of every
seventh sabbatical year, that great year of grace under the old covenant
([Lev 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009)); just as the seventh month
in general formed the link between the weekly Sabbath and the sabbatical
and jubilee years, and corresponded as a Sabbath month to the year of
jubilee rather than the sabbatical year, which had its prelude in the
weekly Sabbath-day.

[Leviticus 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 23:26</span></span>

On the tenth day of the seventh month the day of atonement was to be
observed by a holy meeting, by fasting from the evening of the ninth
till the evening of the tenth, by resting from all work on pain of
death, and with sacrifices, of which the great expiatory sacrifice
peculiar to this day had already been appointed in ch. 16, and the
general festal sacrifices are described in [Num
29:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#008). (For fuller particulars, see
at ch. 16.) By the restrictive אך, the observance of the day of
atonement is represented a priori as a peculiar one. The אך refers less
to "the tenth day," than to the leading directions respecting this
feast: "only on the tenth of this seventh month...there shall be a holy
meeting to you, and ye shall afflict your souls," etc.

[Leviticus 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 23:32</span></span>

"Ye shall rest your rest," i.e., observe the rest that is binding upon
you from all laborious work.

[Leviticus 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 23:33</span></span>

On the fifteenth of the same month the feast of Tabernacles was to be
kept to the Lord for seven days: on the first day with a holy meeting
and rest from all laborious work, and for seven days with sacrifices, as
appointed for every day in Num 29:13-33. Moreover, on the eighth day,
i.e., the 22nd of the month, the closing feast was to be observed in the
same manner as on the first day ([Lev
23:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034)). The name, "feast of
Tabernacles" (booths), is to be explained from the fact, that the
Israelites were to dwell in booths made of boughs for the seven days
that this festival lasted ([Lev
23:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042)). עצרת, which is used in [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036) and [Num
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035) for the eighth day, which
terminated the feast of Tabernacles, and in [Deu
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#008) for the seventh day of the feast
of Mazzoth, signifies the solemn close of a feast of several days,
clausula festi, from עצר to shut in, or close ([Gen
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#002); [Deu
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017), etc.), not a coagendo,
congregando populo ad festum, nor a cohibitione laboris, ab interdicto
opere, because the word is only applied to the last day of the feasts of
Mazzoth and Tabernacles, and not to the first, although this was also
kept with a national assembly and suspension of work. But as these
clausaulae festi were holidays with a holy convocation and suspension of
work, it was very natural that the word should be transferred at a later
period to feasts generally, on which the people suspended work and met
for worship and edification ([Joe
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014); [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013); [Kg2
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#020)). The azareth, as the eighth
day, did not strictly belong to the feast of Tabernacles, which was only
to last seven days; and it was distinguished, moreover, from these seven
days by a smaller number of offerings ([Num
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035).). The eighth day was rather the
solemn close of the whole circle of yearly feasts, and therefore was
appended to the close of the last of these feasts as the eighth day of
the feast itself (see at Num 28 seq.). - With [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036) the enumeration of all the
yearly feasts on which holy meetings were to be convened is brought to
an end. This is stated in the concluding formula ([Lev
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#037), [Lev
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#038)), which answers to the heading
in [Lev 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004), in which the Sabbaths
are excepted, as they simply belonged to the moadim in the more general
sense of the word. In this concluding formula, therefore, there is no
indication that [Lev 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002) and [Lev
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003) and [Lev
23:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039) are later additions to the
original list of feasts which were to be kept with a meeting for
worship. וגו להקריב (to offer, etc.) is not dependent upon "holy
convocations," but upon the main idea, "feasts of Jehovah." Jehovah had
appointed moadim, fixed periods in the year, for His congregation to
offer sacrifices; not as if no sacrifices could be or were to be offered
except at these feasts, but to remind His people, through these fixed
days, of their duty to approach the Lord with sacrifices. אשּׁה is
defined by the enumeration of four principal kinds of
sacrifice-burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, slain (i.e., peace-)
offerings, and drink-offerings. בּ יום דּבר: "every day those appointed
for it," as in [Exo 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#013).

[Leviticus 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">lev 23:38</span></span>

"Beside the Sabbaths:" i.e., the Sabbath sacrifices (see [Num
28:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009)), and the gifts and offerings,
which formed no integral part of the keeping of the feasts and Sabbaths,
but might be offered on those days. מתּנות, gifts, include all the
dedicatory offerings, which were presented to the Lord without being
intended to be burned upon the altar; such, for example, as the
dedicatory gifts of the tribe-princes (Num 7), the firstlings and
tithes, and other so-called heave-offerings ([Num
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#011), [Num
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#029)). By the "vows" and נדבות,
"freewill-offerings," we are to understand not only the votive and
freewill slain or peace-offerings, but burnt-offerings also, and
meat-offerings, which were offered in consequence of a vow, or from
spontaneous impulse (see [Jdg 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#031),
where Jephthah vows a burnt-offering). - In [Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039). there follows a fuller
description of the observance of the last feast of the year, for which
the title, "feast of Tabernacles" ([Lev
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034)), had prepared the way, as the
feast had already been mentioned briefly in [Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016) and [Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022) as "feast of Ingathering,"
though hitherto no rule had been laid down concerning the peculiar
manner in which it was to be observed. In connection with this epithet
in Exodus, it is described again in [Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039), as in [Lev
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#035), [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036), as a seven days' feast, with
sabbatical rest on the first and eighth day; and in [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040). the following rule is given for
its observance: "Take to you fruit of ornamental trees, palm-branches,
and boughs of trees with thick foliage, and willows of the brook, and
rejoice before the Lord your God seven days, every native in Israel." If
we observe that there are only three kinds of boughs that are connected
together by the copula (vav) in [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040), and that it is wanting before
תם כּפּת, there can hardly be any doubt that הדר עץ פּרי is the generic
term, and that the three names which follow specify the particular kinds
of boughs. By "the fruits," therefore, we understand the shoots and
branches of the trees, as well as the blossom and fruit that grew out of
them. הדר עץ, "trees of ornament:" we are not to understand by these
only such trees as the orange and citron, which were placed in gardens
for ornament rather than use, as the Chald. and Syr. indicate, although
these trees grow in the gardens of Palestine (Rob., Pal. i. 327, iii.
420). The expression is a more general one, and includes myrtles, which
were great favourites with the ancients, on account of their beauty and
the fragrant odour which they diffused, olive-trees, palms, and other
trees, which were used as booths in Ezra's time ([Neh
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#015)). In the words, "Take fruit of
ornamental trees," it is not expressly stated, it is true, that this
fruit was to be used, like the palm-branches, for constructing booths;
but this is certainly implied in the context: "Take...and rejoice...and
keep a feast...in the booths shall he dwell." בּסּכּת with the article
is equivalent to "in the booths which ye have constructed from the
branches mentioned" (cf. Ges. 109, 3). It was in this sense that the law
was understood and carried out in the time of Ezra ([Neh
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#015).).

(Note: Even in the time of the Maccabees, on the other hand (cf. 2 Macc.
10:6, 7), the feast of the Purification of the Temple was celebrated by
the Jews after the manner of the Tabernacles (κατὰ σκηνωμάτων τρόπον);
so that they offered songs of praise, holding (ἔχοντες, carrying?) leafy
poles (θύρσους, not branches of ivy, cf. Grimm. ad l.c.) and beautiful
branches, also palms; in the time of Christ it was the custom to have
sticks or poles (staves) of palm-trees and citron-trees (θύρσους ἐκ
φοινίκων καὶ κιτρέων: Josephus, Ant. xiii. 13, 5), or to carry in the
hand a branch of myrtle and willow bound round with wool, with palms at
the top and an apple of the περσέα (peach or pomegranate?) upon it
(εἰρεσιώνην μυρσίνης καὶ ἰτέας σὺν κράδῃ φοίνικος πεποιημένην τοῦ μήλου
τοῦ τῆς Περσέας προσόντος). This custom, which was still further
developed in the Talmud, where a bunch made of palm, myrtle, and willow
boughs is ordered to be carried in the right hand, and a citron or
orange in the left, has no foundation in the law: it sprang rather out
of an imitation of the Greek harvest-feast of the Pyanepsia and Bacchus
festivals, from which the words θύρσοι and εἰρεσιώνη were borrowed by
Josephus, and had been tacked on by the scribes to the text of the Bible
(v. 40) in the best way they could. See Bδhr, Symbol. ii. p. 625, and
the innumerable trivial laws in Mishna Succa and Succa Codex talm.
babyl. sive de tabernaculorum festo ed. Dachs. Utr. 1726, 4.)

The leading character of the feast of Tabernacles, which is indicated at
the outset by the emphatic אך ([Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039), see at [Lev
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027)), was to consist in "joy before
the Lord." As a "feast," i.e., a feast of joy (חג, from חגג = חוּג,
denoting the circular motion of the dance, [Sa1
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#016)), it was to be kept for seven
days; so that Israel "should be only rejoicing," and give itself up
entirely to joy ([Deu 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#015)). Now,
although the motive assigned in Deut. is this: "for God will bless thee
(Israel) in all thine increase, and in all the work of thine hands;" and
although the feast, as a "feast of ingathering," was a feast of
thanksgiving for the gathering in of the produce of the land, "the
produce of the floor and wine-press;" and the blessing they had received
in the harvested fruits, the oil and wine, which contributed even more
to the enjoyment of life than the bread that was needed for daily food,
furnished in a very high degree the occasion and stimulus to the
utterance of grateful joy: the origin and true signification of the
feast of Tabernacles are not to be sought for in this natural allusion
to the blessing of the harvest, but the dwelling in booths was the
principal point in the feast; and this was instituted as a law for all
future time ([Lev 23:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#041)), that
succeeding generations might know that Jehovah had caused the children
of Israel to dwell in booths when He led them out of Egypt ([Lev
23:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#043)). סכּה, a booth or hut, is not
to be confounded with אחל a tent, but comes from סכך texuit, and
signifies casa, umbraculum ex frondibus ramisque consertum (Ges. thes.
s. v.), serving as a defence both against the heat of the sun, and also
against wind and rain ([Psa 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021);
[Isa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006); [Jon
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005)). Their dwelling in booths was by
no means intended, as Bhr supposes, to bring before the minds of the
people the unsettled wandering life of the desert, and remind them of
the trouble endured there, for the recollection of privation and want
can never be an occasion of joy; but it was to place vividly before the
eyes of the future generations of Israel a memorial of the grace, care,
and protection which God afforded to His people in the great and
terrible wilderness ([Deu 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015)).
Whether the Israelites, in their journey through the wilderness, not
only used the tents which they had taken with them (cf. [Lev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#008); [Exo
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001); [Exo
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#007); [Exo
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#008).; [Num
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#026)., [Lev
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005), etc.), but erected booths of
branches and bushes in those places of encampment where they remained
for a considerable time, as the Bedouins still do sometimes in the
peninsula of Sinai (Burckhardt, Syrien, p. 858), or not; at all events,
the shielding and protecting presence of the Lord in the pillar of cloud
and fire was, in the words of the prophet, "a booth (tabernacle) for a
shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for
a covert from storm and from rain" ([Isa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006)) in the barren wilderness, to
those who had just been redeemed out of Egypt. Moreover, the booths used
at this feast were not made of miserable shrubs of the desert, but of
branches of fruit-trees, palms and thickly covered trees, the produce of
the good and glorious land into which God had brought them ([Deu
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007).); and in this respect they
presented a living picture of the plenteous fulness of blessing with
which the Lord had enriched His people. This fulness of blessing was to
be called to mind by their dwelling in booths; in order that, in the
land "wherein they ate bread without scarceness and lacked nothing,
where they built goodly houses and dwelt therein; where their herds and
flocks, their silver and their gold, and all that they had, multiplied"
([Deu 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#009), [Deu
8:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#012)), they might not say in their
hearts, "My power, and the might of mine hand, hath gotten me this
wealth," but might remember that Jehovah was their God, who gave them
power to get wealth ([Lev 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017), [Lev
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#018)), that so their heart might not
"be lifted up and forget Jehovah their God, who had led them out of the
land of Egypt, the house of bondage." If, therefore, the foliage of the
booths pointed to the glorious possessions of the inheritance, which the
Lord had prepared for His redeemed people in Canaan, yet the natural
allusion of the feast, which was superadded to the historical, and
subordinate to it, - viz., to the plentiful harvest of rich and
beautiful fruits, which they had gathered in from this inheritance, and
could now enjoy in peace after the toil of cultivating the land was
over, - would necessarily raise their hearts to still higher joy through
their gratitude to the Lord and Giver of all, and make this feats a
striking figure of the blessedness of the people of God when resting
from their labours.
