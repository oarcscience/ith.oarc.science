### [Proverbs Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 30:1</span></span>

The title of this first appendix, according to the text lying before us,
is:

"The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the utterance."

This title of the following collection of proverbs is limited by
Olewejored; and המּשּׂא, separated from the author's name by Rebia, is
interpreted as a second inscription, standing on one line with דּברי, as
particularizing that first. The old synagogue tradition which, on the
ground of the general title [Pro 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md),
regarded the whole Book of Proverbs as the work of Solomon, interpreted
the words, "Agur the son of Jakeh," as an allegorical designation of
Solomon, who appropriated the words of the Tôra to the king, [Deu
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017.md), and again rejected them, for he
said: God is with me, and I shall not do it (viz., take many wives,
without thereby suffering injury), Schemth rabba, c. 6. The translation
of Jerome: Verba congregantis filii Vomentis, is the echo of this Jewish
interpretation. One would suppose that if "Agur" were Solomon's name,
"Jakeh" must be that of David; but another interpretation in Midrash
Mishle renders בן ("son") as the designation of the bearer of a quality,
and sees in "Agur" one who girded (אגר = חגר) his loins for wisdom; and
in "son of Jakeh" one free from sin (חטא ועון נקי מכל). In the Middle
Ages this mode of interpretation, which is historically and
linguistically absurd, first began to prevail; for then the view was
expressed by several (Aben Ezra, and Meri the Spaniard) that Agur ben
Jakeh was a wise man of the time of Solomon. That of Solomon's time,
they thence conclude (blind to [Pro
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001).md) that Solomon collected together
these proverbs of the otherwise unknown wise man. In truth, the age of
the man must remain undecided; and at all events, the time of Hezekiah
is the fixed period from which, where possible, it is to be sought. The
name "Agur" means the gathered ([Pro
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#008.md); [Pro
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005).md), or, after the predominant
meaning of the Arab. âjar, the bribed, mercede conductum; also the
collector (cf. יקוּשׁ, fowler); or the word might mean, perhaps,
industrious in collecting (cf. 'alwaḳ, attached to, and other examples
in Mhlau, p. 36). Regarding בּן = binj (usual in בּן־נּוּן), and its
relation to the Arab. ibn, vid., Genesis, p. 555. The name Jakeh is more
transparent. The noun יקהה, [Pro
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017.md); [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), means the obedient, from the
verb יקהּ; but, formed from this verbal stem, the form of the word would
be יקהּ (not יקה). The form יקה is the participial adj. from יקה, like
יפה from יפה; and the Arab. waḳay, corresponding to this יקה, viii.
ittaḳay, to be on one's guard, particularly before God; the usual word
fore piety regarded as εὐλάβεια. Mhlau (p. 37) rightly sees in the
proper names Eltekeh \[[Jos 19:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#044.md)\]
and Eltekon \[[Jos 15:59](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#059.md)\] the
secondary verbal stem תּקה, which, like e.g., תּוה (תּאה), תּאב, עתד,
has originated from the reflexive, which in these proper names,
supposing that אל is subj., means to take under protection; not: to give
heed = cavere. All these meanings are closely connected. In all these
three forms - יקהּ, יקה, תּקה - the verb is a synonym of שׁמר; so that
יקה denotes

(Note: According to the Lex. 'Gezer (from the Mesopotamian town of
'Geziret ibn 'Amr), the word wakihon is, in the Mesopotamian language,
"the overseer of the house in which is the cross of the Christians;" and
accordingly, in Muhammed's letter to the Christians of Negran, after
they became subject to him, "a monk shall not be removed from his
monastery, nor a presbyter from his presbyterate, (waḳâhtah) wala watah
wakahyttah" (this will be the correct phrase), "nor an overseer from his
office." The verbal stem waḳ-ah (יקהּ) is, as it appears, Northern
Semitic; the South Arabian lexicographer Neshwan ignores it (Wetzstein
in Mhlau).)

the pious, either as taking care, εὐλαβής, or as keeping, i.e.,
observing, viz., that which is commanded by God.

In consequence of the accentuation, המשּׂא is the second designation of
this string of proverbs, and is parallel with דברי. But that is
absolutely impossible. משּׂא (from נשׂא, to raise, viz., the voice, to
begin to express) denotes the utterance, and according to the usage of
the words before us, the divine utterance, the message of God revealed
to the prophet and announced by him, for the most part, if not always
(vid., at [Isa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001).md), the message of
God as the avenger. Accordingly Jewish interpreters (e.g., Meri and
Arama) remark that משׂא designates what follows, as דבר נבוּאיּי, i.e.,
an utterance of the prophetic spirit. But, on the other hand, what
follows begins with the confession of human weakness and
short-sightedness; and, moreover, we read proverbs not of a divine but
altogether of a human and even of a decaying spiritual stamp, besides
distinguished from the Solomonic proverbs by this, that the I of the
poet, which remains in the background, here comes to the front. This
משׂא of prophetic utterances does not at all harmonize with the
following string of proverbs. It does not so harmonize on this account,
because one theme does not run through these proverbs which the sing.
משׂא requires. It comes to this, that משׂא never occurs by itself in the
sense of a divine, a solemn utterance, without having some more clearly
defining addition, though it should be only a demonstrative הזּה ([Isa
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028).md). But what author, whether poet
or prophet, would give to his work the title of משׂא, which in itself
means everything, and thus nothing! And now: the utterance - what can
the article at all mean here? This question has remained unanswered by
every interpreter. Ewald also sees himself constrained to clothe the
naked word; he does it by reading together המשׂא נאם, and translating
the "sublime saying which he spoke." But apart from the consideration
that [Jer 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#031.md) proves nothing for the
use of this use of נאם, the form (הגבר) נאם is supported by [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md) (cf. [Pro
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md) with [Sa2
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#031).md); and besides, the omission of
the אשׁר, and in addition of the relative pronoun (נאמו), would be an
inaccuracy not at all to be expected on the brow of this gnomology
(vid., Hitzig). If we leave the altogether unsuspected נאם undisturbed,
המשׂא will be a nearer definition of the name of the author. The Midrash
has a right suspicion, for it takes together Hamassa and Agur ben Jakeh,
and explains: of Agur the son of Jakeh, who took upon himself the yoke
of the most blessed. The Graecus Venetus comes nearer what is correct,
for it translates: λόγοι Ἀγούρου υἱέως Ἰακέως τοῦ Μασάου. We connect
[Pro 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md), where למוּאל מלך, "Lemuel
(the) king," is a linguistic impossibility, and thus, according to the
accentuation lying before us, מלך משּׂא also are to be connected
together; thus it appears that משׂא must be the name of a country and a
people. It was Hitzig who first made this Columbus-egg to stand. But
this is the case only so far as he recognised in למואל מלך משׂא a
Lemuel, the king of Massa, and recognised this Massa also in [Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md) (vid., his dissertation: Das
Knigreich Massa \[the kingdom of Massa\], in Zeller's Theolog. Jahrbb.
1844, and his Comm.), viz., the Israelitish Massa named in [Gen
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#014.md) (= [Ch1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#030).md) along with Dumah and Tema. But
he proceeds in a hair-splitting way, and with ingenious hypothesis,
without any valid foundation. That this Dumah is the Dumat el-jendel
(cf. under [Isa 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011).md) lying in the
north of Nejed, near the southern frontiers of Syria, the name and the
founding of which is referred by the Arabians to Dm the son of Ishmael,
must be regarded as possible, and consequently Massa is certainly to be
sought in Northern Arabia. But if, on the ground of [Ch1
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#042.md)., he finds there a Simeonitic
kingdom, and finds its origin in this, that the tribe of Simeon
originally belonging to the ten tribes, and thus coming from the north
settled in the south of Judah, and from thence in the days of Hezekiah,
fleeing before the Assyrians, were driven farther and farther in a
south-east direction towards Northern Arabia; on the contrary, it has
been shown by Graf (The Tribe of Simeon, a contribution to the history
of Israel, 1866) that Simeon never settled in the north of the Holy
Land, and according to existing evidences extended their settlement from
Negeb partly into the Idumean highlands, but not into the highlands of
North Arabia. Hitzig thinks that there are found traces of the Massa of
Agur and Lemuel in the Jewish town

(Note: Cf. Blau's Arab. im sechsten Jahrh. in the Deutsch. Morgl. Zeits.
xxxiii. 590, and also p. 573 of the same, regarding a family of
proselytes among the Jews in Taima.)

of טילמאס, of Benjamin of Tudela, lying three days' journey from Chebar,
and in the proper name (Arab.) Malsā (smooth), which is given to a rock
between Tema and Wady el-Kora (vid., Kosegarten's Chestom. p. 143); but
how notched his ingenuity here is need scarcely be shown. By means of
more cautious combinations Mhlau has placed the residence of Agur and
Lemuel in the Hauran mountain range, near which there is a Dumah,
likewise a Tm; and in the name of the town Mismje, lying in the Lej, is
probably found the Mishma which is named along with Massa, [Gen
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#014.md); and from this that is related
in [Ch1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009.md)., [Ch1
5:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018.md), of warlike expeditions on the
part of the tribes lying on the east of the Jordan against the Hagarenes
and their allies Jetur, Nephish, and Nodab,

(Note: Mhlau combines Nodab with Nudbe to the south-east of Bosra; Blau
(Deut. Morg. Zeit. xxv. 566), with the Ναβδαῖοι of Eupolemos named along
with the Ναβατοῖοι. The Kams has Nadab as the name of a tribe.)

it is with certainty concluded that in the Hauran, and in the wilderness
which stretches behind the Euphrates towards it, Israelitish tribes have
had their abode, whose territory had been early seized by the
trans-Jordanic tribes, and was held "until the captivity," [Ch1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022.md), i.e., till the Assyrian
deportation. This designation of time is almost as unfavourable to
Mhlau's theory of a Massa in the Hauran, inhabited by Israelitish tribes
from the other side, as the expression "to Mount Seir" ([Ch1
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#042).md) is to Hitzig's North Arabian
Massa inhabited by Simeonites. We must leave it undecided whether Dumah
and Tm, which the Toledoth of Ismael name in the neighbourhood of Massa,
are the east Hauran districts now existing; or as Blau (Deut. Morgl.
Zeit. xxv. 539), with Hitzig, supposes, North Arabian districts (cf.
Genesis. p. 377, 4th ed.).

(Note: Dozy (Israeliten in Mecca, p. 89f.) connects Massa with Mansh, a
pretended old name of Mecca.)

"Be it as it may, the contents and the language of this difficult piece
almost necessarily point to a region bordering on the Syro-Arabian
waste. Ziegler's view (Neue Uebers. der Denksprche Salomo's, 1791, p.
29), that Lemuel was probably an emir of an Arabian tribe in the east of
Jordan, and that a wise Hebrew translated those proverbs of the emir
into Hebrew, is certainly untenable, but does not depart so far from the
end as may appear at the first glance" (Mhlau).

(Note: These German quotations with the name of Mhlau are taken from the
additions to his book, which he placed at my disposal.)

If the text-punctuation lying before us rests on the false supposition
that Massa, [Pro 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md); [Pro
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md), is a generic name, and not a
proper name, then certainly the question arises whether משׂא should not
be used instead of משּׂא, much more משׂא, which is suggested as possible
in the article "Sprche," in Herzog's Encycl. xiv. 694. Were משׁא, [Gen
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#030.md), the region Μεσήνη, on the
northern border of the Persian Gulf, in which Apamea lay, then it might
be said in favour of this, that as the histories of Muhammed and of
Benjamin of Tudela prove the existence of an old Jewish occupation of
North Arabia, but without anything being heard of a משּׂא, the Talmud
bears testimony

(Note: Vid., Neubauer's Le Gographie du Talmud, pp. 325, 329, 382.)

to a Jewish occupation of Mesene, and particularly of Apamea; and by the
mother of Lemuel, the king of Mesha, one may think

(Note: Derenbourg's Essai sur l'Hist. et la Gog. de la Palestine, i. p.
224.)

of Helena, celebrated in Jewish writings, queen of Adiabene, the mother
of Monabaz and Izates. But the identity of the Mesha of the catalogue of
nations with Μεσήνη is uncertain, and the Jewish population of that
place dates at least from the time of the Sassanides to the period of
the Babylonian exile. We therefore hold by the Ishmaelite Massa, whether
North Arabian or Hauranian; but we by no means subscribe Mhlau's non
possumus non negare, Agurum et Lemulem proseytos e paganis, non
Israelitas fuisse. The religion of the tribes descended from Abraham, so
far as it had not degenerated, was not to be regarded as idolatrous. It
was the religion which exists to the present day among the great
Ishmaelite tribes of the Syrian desert as the true tradition of their
fathers under the name of Dn Ibrhm (Abraham's religion); which, as from
Wetzstein, we have noted in the Commentary on Job (p. 387 and
elsewhere), continues along with Mosaism among the nomadic tribes of the
wilderness; which shortly before the appearance of Christianity in the
country beyond the Jordan, produced doctrines coming into contact with
the teachings of the gospel; which at that very time, according to
historic evidences (e.g., Mjsin's chronicles of the Ka'be), was dominant
even in the towns of Higz; and in the second century after Christ, was
for the first time during the repeated migration of the South Arabians
again oppressed by Greek idolatry, and was confined to the wilderness;
which gave the mightiest impulse to the rise of Islam, and furnished its
best component part; and which towards the end of the last century, in
the country of Neged, pressed to a reform of Islam, and had as a result
the Wahabite doctrine. If we except [Pro
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md)., the proverbs of Agur and Lemuel
contain nothing which may not be conceived from a non-Israelitish
standpoint on which the author of the Book of Job placed himself. Even
[Job 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#005.md). is not there (cf. [Job
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#010.md); [Job
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012).md) without parallels. When one
compares [Deu 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002.md); [Deu
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md), and [Sa2
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#031.md) = [Psa
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md) (from which [Pro
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md) of the proverbs of Agur is
derived, with the change of יהוה into אלוהּ), Agur certainly appears as
one intimately acquainted with the revealed religion of Israel, and with
their literature. But must we take the two Massites therefore, with
Hitzig, Mhlau, and Zckler, as born Israelites? Since the Bible history
knows no Israelitish king outside of the Holy Land, we regard it as more
probable that King Lemuel and his countryman Agur were Ishmaelites who
had raised themselves above the religion of Abraham, and recognised the
religion of Israel as its completion.

If we now return to the words of [Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md), Hitzig makes Agur Lemuel's
brother, for he vocalizes אגוּר בּן־יקההּ משּׂא, i.e., Agur the son of
her whom Massa obeys. Ripa and Bjrck of Sweden, and Stuart of America,
adopt this view. But supposing that יקהּ is connected with the
accusative of him who is obeyed, בן, as the representative of such an
attributive clause, as of its virtual genitive, is elsewhere without
example; and besides, it is unadvisable to explain away the proper name
יקה, which speaks for itself. There are two other possibilities of
comprehending המּשּׁא, without the change, or with the change of a
single letter. Wetzstein, on [Pro
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md), has said regarding Mhlau's
translation "King of Massa:" "I would more cautiously translate, 'King
of the Massans,' since this interpretation is unobjectionable; while, on
the contrary, this is not terra Massa, nor urbs Massa. It is true that
the inhabitants of Massa were not pure nomads, after 30 and 31, but
probably, like the other tribes of Israel, they were half nomads, who
possessed no great land as exclusive property, and whose chief place did
not perhaps bear their name. The latter may then have been as rare in
ancient times as it is in the present day. Neither the Sammar, the Harb,
the Muntefik, nor other half nomads whom I know in the southern parts of
the Syrian desert, have any place which bears their name. So also, it
appears, the people of Uz (עוץ), which we were constrained to think of
as a dominant, firmly-settled race, since it had so great a husbandman
as Job, possessed no קרית עוּץ. Only in certain cases, where a tribe
resided for many centuries in and around a place, does the name of this
tribe appear to have remained attached to it. Thus from גוּף דּוּמה,
'the low-country of the Dumahns,' or קרית דּוּמה, 'the city of Dumahns,'
as also from קרית תּימא, 'the city of the Temans,' gradually there arose
(probably not till the decline and fall of this tribe) a city of Dumah,
a haven of Midian, and the like, so that the primary meaning of the name
came to be lost." It is clear that, from the existence of an Ishmaelite
tribe משּׂא, there does not necessarily follow a similar name given to a
region. The conj. ממּשּׂא, for המשּׂא (vid., Herzog's Encycl. xiv. 702),
has this against it, that although it is good Heb., it directly leads to
this conclusion (e.g., [Sa2 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020.md),
[Sa2 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#029.md), cf. [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001).md). Less objectionable is Bunsen's
and Bttcher's המּשּׂאי. But perhaps המשׂא may also have the same
signification; far rather at least this than that which Malbim, after
השּׂר המשּׂא, [Ch1 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027.md), introduced
with the lxx ἄρχων τῶν ᾠδῶν: "We ought then to compare [Sa2
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#024.md), דודו בּית לחם, a connection in
which, after the analogy of such Arabic connections as ḳaysu'aylana,
Kais of the tribe of 'Ailn (Ibn Coteiba, 13 and 83), or Ma'nu Ṭayyin,
Ma'n of the tribe of Tay, i.e., Ma'n belonging to this tribe, as
distinguished from other men and families of this name (Schol. Hamasae
144. 3), בית לחם is thought of as genit"

(Note: In 'העם וגו, [Jer 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#005.md), 'ירושׁ
is though of as genit., although it may be also nom., after the scheme
of apposition instead of annexion. That it is genit., cf. Philippi's St.
Const. pp. 192-195.)

(Mhlau). That בית לחם (instead of בּית הלּחמי) is easily changed, with
Thenius and Wellhausen, after [Ch1
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#026.md), into מבּית לחם, and in itself
it is not altogether homogeneous, because without the article. Yet it
may be supposed that instead of משׂא, on account of the appelat. of the
proper name (the lifting up, elatio), the word המשׂא might be also
employed. And since בן־יקה, along with אגור, forms, as it were, one
compositum, and does not at all destroy

(Note: We say, in Arab., without any anomaly, e.g., Alı̂ju-bnu-Muḥammadin
Tajjin, i.e., the Ali son of Muhammed, of the tribe (from the tribe) of
Tay; cf. [Jos 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#011.md); [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md); [Isa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011.md); and [Deu
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013)..md)

the regulating force of אגור, the expression is certainly, after the
Arabic usus loq., to be thus explained: The words of Agur the son of
Jakeh, of the tribe (the country) of Massa.

The second line of this verse, as it is punctuated, is to be rendered:

The saying of the man to Ithel, to Ithel and Uchal,

not Ukkal; for, since Athias and van der Hooght, the incorrect form
ואכּל has become current. J. H. Michaelis has the right form of the word
ואכל. Thus, with כ raphatum, it is to be read after the Masora, for it
adds to this word the remark לית וחסר, and counts it among the
forty-eight words sometimes written defectively without ו (vid., this
list in the Masora finalis, 27b, Col); and since it only remarks the
absence of the letter lengthening the word where no dagesh follows the
vocal, it thus supposes that the כ has no dagesh, as it is also found in
Codd. (also Jaman.) written with the Raphe. לאיתיאל is doubly
accentuated; the Tarcha represents the Metheg, after the rule Thorath
Emeth, p. 11. The ל after נאם is, in the sense of the punctuation, the
same dat. as in לאדני, [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), and
has an apparent right in him who asks כּי תדע in the 4th verse. Ithel
and Uchal must be, after an old opinion, sons, or disciples, or
contemporaries, of Agur. Thus, e.g., Gesenius, in his Lex. under איתיאל,
where as yet his reference to [Neh
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#007.md) is wanting. איתיאל is rendered by
Jefet and other Karaites, "there is a God" = איתי אל; but it is perhaps
equivalent to אתּי אל, "God is with me;" as for אתּי rof sa ";e, the
form איתי is also found. אכל (אכל) nowhere occurs as a proper name; but
in the region of proper names, everything, or almost everything, is
possible.

(Note: Vid., Wetzstein's Inschriften aus den Trachonen und dem
Haurangebirge (1864), p. 336f.)

Ewald sees in 1b-14 a dialogue: in [Pro
30:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#002.md) the הגּבר, i.e., as the word
appears to him, the rich, haughty mocker, who has worn out his life,
speaks; and in [Pro 30:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md) the
"Mitmirgott" \[= God with me\], or, more fully,
"Mitmirgott-sobinichstark" \[= God with me, so am I strong\], i.e., the
pious, humble man answers. "The whole," he remarks, "is nothing but
poetical; and it is poetical also that this discourse of mockery is
called an elevated strain." But (1) גּבר is a harmless word; and in נאם
הגּבר, [Num 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md), [Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md); [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001), it is a solemn, earnest one; (2.md)
a proper name, consisting of two clauses connected by Vav, no matter
whether it be an actual or a symbolical name, is not capable of being
authenticated; Ewald, 274b, recognises in 'גּדּלתּי וגו, [Ch1
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md), the naming, not of one son of
Heman, but of two; and (3) it would be a very forced, inferior poetry if
the poet placed one half of the name in one line, and then, as if
constrained to take a new breath, gave the other half of it in a second
line. But, on the other hand, that איתיאל and אכל are the names of two
different persons, to whom the address of the man is directed, is
attested by the, in this case aimless, anadiplosis, the here unpoetical
parallelism with reservation. The repetition, as Fleischer remarks, of
the name Ithel, which may rank with Uchal, as the son or disciple of
Agur, has probably its reason only as this, that one placed a second
more extended phrase simply along with the shorter. The case is
different; but Fleischer's supposition, that the poet himself cannot
have thus written, is correct. We must not strike out either of the two
לאיתיאל; but the supposed proper names must be changed as to their
vocalization into a declaratory clause. A principal argument lies in
[Pro 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#002.md), beginning with כּי: this כי
supposes a clause which it established; for, with right, Mhlau maintains
that כי, in the affirmative sense, which, by means of aposiopesis,
proceeds from the confirmative, may open the conclusion and enter as
confirmatory into the middle of the discourse (e.g., [Isa
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013).md), but cannot stand abruptly at
the commencement of a discourse (cf. under [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md) and [Isa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009).md). But if we now ask how it is to
be vocalized, there comes at the same time into the sphere of
investigation the striking phrase נאם הגּבר. This phrase all the Greek
interpreters attest by their rendering, τάδε λέγει ὁ ἀνήρ (Venet. φησὶν
ἀνήρ); besides, this is to be brought forward from the wilderness of the
old attempts at a translation, that the feeling of the translators
strives against the recognition in ואכל of a second personal name: the
Peshito omits it; the Targ. translates it, after the Midrash, by ואוּכל
(I may do it); as Theodotion, καὶ δυνήσομαι, which is probably also
meant by the καὶ συνήσομαι (from συνείναι, to be acquainted with) of the
Venet.; the lxx with καὶ παύομαι; and Aquila, καὶ τέλεσον (both from the
verb כלה). As an objection to נאם הגבר is this, that it is so bald
without being followed, as at [Num
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md), [Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md); [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md), with the attributive description
of the man. Luther was determined thereby to translate: discourse of the
man Leithiel.... And why could not לאיתיאל be a proper-name connection
like שׁאלתּיאל (שׁלתּיאל)? Interpreted in the sense of "I am troubled
concerning God," is might be a symbolical name of the φιλόσοφος, as of
one who strives after the knowledge of divine things with all his
strength. But (1) לאה, with the accus. obj., is not established, and one
is rather inclined to think of a name such as כּליתיאל, after [Psa
84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003); (2.md) moreover, לאיתיאל cannot be
at one time a personal name, and at another time a declarative sentence
- one must both times transform it into לאיתי אל; but אל has to be taken
as a vocative, not as accus., as is done by J. D. Michaelis, Hitzig,
Bunsen, Zckler, and others, thus: I have wearied myself, O God!... The
nakedness of הגבר is accordingly not covered by the first Leithiel.
Mhlau, in his work, seeks to introduce המשׂא changed into ממשׂא: "The
man from Massa," and prefers to interpret הגבר generically:

(Note: Thus, viz., that הגבר denotes, not the man as he ought to be, but
the man as he usually is (the article, as the Arabic grammarians say,
"not for the exhaustion of the characteristic marks of the genus," but
for the expression of "the quality mhje of the genus").)

"proverb (confession) of the man (i.e., the man must confess): I have
wearied myself, O God!..." Nothing else in reality remains. The article
may also be retrospective: the man just now named, whose "words" are
announced, viz., Agur. But why was not the expression נאם אגור then
used? Because it is not poetical to say: "the (previously named) man."
On the other hand, what follows applies so that one may understand,
under הגבר, any man you choose. There are certainly among men more than
too many who inquire not after God ([Psa
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002)..md). But there are also not wanting
those who feel sorrowfully the distance between them and God. Agur
introduces such a man as speaking, for he generalizes his own
experience. [Psa 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002.md) (vid., under
this passage) shows that a proper name does not necessarily follow נאם.
With נאם הגבר Agur then introduces what the man has to confess - viz. a
man earnestly devoted to God; for with נאם the ideas of that which comes
from the heart and the solemnly earnest are connected. If Agur so far
generalizes his own experience, the passionate anadiplosis does not
disturb this. After long contemplation of the man, he must finally
confess: I have troubled myself, O God! I have troubled myself, O
God!... That the trouble was directed toward God is perhaps denoted by
the alliteration of לאיתי with אל. But what now, further? ואכל is read
as ואכל, ואכל, ואכל, ואכל, ואכל, and it has also been read as ואכל. The
reading ואכל no one advocates; this that follows says the direct
contrary, et potui (pollui). Geiger (Urschrift, p. 61) supports the
reading ואכל, for he renders it interrogatively: "I wearied myself in
vain about God, I wearied myself in vain about God; why should I be able
to do it?" But since one may twist any affirmative clause in this way,
and from a yes make a no, one should only, in cases of extreme
necessity, consent to such a question in the absence of an interrogative
word. Bttcher's לאיתי אל, I have wearied myself out in vain, is not
Hebrew. But at any rate the expression might be אל־אכל, if only the Vav
did not stand between the words! If one might transpose the letters,
then we might gain ולא אכל, according to which the lxx translates: οὐ
δυνήσομαι. At all events, this despairing as to the consequence of
further trouble, "I shall be able to do nothing (shall bring it to
nothing)," would be better than ואכל (and I shall withdraw - become
faint), for which, besides, ואכלה should be used (cf. [Pro
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008.md) with [Job
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#021).md). One expects, after לאיתי, the
expression of that which is the consequence of earnest and
long-continued endeavour. Accordingly Hitzig reads ואכל, and I have
become dull - suitable to the sense, but unsatisfactory on this account,
because כּלל, in the sense of the Arab. kall, hebescere, is foreign to
the Heb. usus loq. Thus ואכל will be a fut. consec. of כלה. J. D.
Michaelis, and finally Bttcher, read it as fut. consec. Piel ואכל or
ואכל (vid., regarding this form in pause under [Pro
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#009).md), "and I have made an end;" but
it is not appropriate to the inquirer here complaining, when
dissatisfaction with his results had determined him to abandon his
research, and let himself be no more troubled. We therefore prefer to
read with Dahler, and, finally, with Mhlau and Zckler, ואכל, and I have
withdrawn. The form understood by Hitzig as a pausal form is, in the
unchangeableness of its vocals, as accordant with rule as those of יחד,
[Pro 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#017.md), which lengthen the a of
their first syllables in pause. And if Hitzig objects that too much is
said, for one of such meditation does not depart, we answer, that if the
inquiry of the man who speaks here has completed itself by the longing
of his spirit and his soul ([Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md);
[Psa 143:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#007).md), he might also say of
himself, in person, כליתי or ואכל. An inquiry proceeding not merely from
intellectual, but, before all, from practical necessity, is meant - the
doubled לאיתי means that he applied thereto the whole strength of his
inner and his outer man; and ואכל, that he nevertheless did not reach
his end, but wearied himself in vain. By this explanation which we give
to 1a, no change of its accents is required; but 1b has to be written:

נאם הגּבר לאיתי אל

לאיתי אל ואכל

(Note: The Munach is the transformation of Mugrash, and this sequence of
accents - Tarcha, Munach, Silluk - remains the same, whether we regard
אל as the accusative or as the vocative.)

[Proverbs 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 30:2</span></span>

The כי now following confirms the fruitlessness of the long zealous
search:

2 For I am without reason for a man,

And a man's understanding I have not.

3 And I have not learned wisdom,

That I may possess the knowledge of the All-Holy.

He who cannot come to any fixed state of consecration, inasmuch as he is
always driven more and more back from the goal he aims at, thereby
brings guilt upon himself as a sinner so great, that every other man
stands above him, and he is deep under them all. So here Agur finds the
reason why in divine things he has failed to attain unto satisfying
intelligence, not in the ignorance and inability common to all men - he
appears to himself as not a man at all, but as an irrational beast, and
he misses in himself the understanding which a man properly might have
and ought to have. The מן of מאישׁ is not the partitive, like [Isa
44:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#011.md), not the usual comparative: than
any one (Bttcher), which ought to be expressed by מכּל־אישׁ, but it is
the negative, as [Isa 52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014.md);
Fleischer: rudior ego sum quam ut homo appeller, or: brutus ego, hominis
non similis. Regarding בּער, vid., under [Pro
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#001.md).

(Note: According to the Arab. בעיר is not a beast as grazing, but as
dropping stercus (ba'r, camel's or sheep's droppings); to the R. בר,
Mhlau rightly gives the meanings of separating, whence are derived the
meanings of grazing as well as of removing (cleansing) (cf. Pers. thak
karadn, to make clean = to make clean house, tabula rasa).)

[Pro 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#003.md) now says that he went into
no school of wisdom, and for that reason in his wrestling after
knowledge could attain to nothing, because the necessary conditions to
this were wanting to him. But then the question arises: Why this
complaint? He must first go to school in order to obtain, according to
the word "To him who hath is given," that for which he strove. Thus
למדתּי refers to learning in the midst of wrestling; but למד,
spiritually understood, signifies the acquiring of a kennens
\[knowledge\] or knnens \[knowledge = ability\]: he has not brought it
out from the deep point of his condition of knowledge to make wisdom his
own, so that he cannot adjudge to himself knowledge of the all-holy God
(for this knowledge is the kernel and the star of true wisdom). If we
read 3b לא אדע, this would be synchronistic, nesciebam, with למדתי
standing on the same line. On the contrary, the positive אדע
subordinates itself to ולא־למדתי, as the Arab. fâa' lama, in the sense
of (ita) ut scirem scientiam Sanctissimi, thus of a conclusion, like
[Lam 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019.md), a clause expressive of the
intention, Ewald, 347a. קדשׁים is, as at [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md), the name of God in a superlative
sense, like the Arab. el-kuddûs.

[Proverbs 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 30:4</span></span>

4 Who hath ascended to the heavens and descended?

Who hath grasped the wind in his fists?

Who hath bound up the waters in a garment?

Who hath set right all the ends of the earth?

What is his name, and what his son's name, if thou knowest?

The first question here, 'מי וגו, is limited by Pazer; עלה־שׁמים has
Metheg in the third syllable before the tone. The second question is at
least shut off by Pazer, but, contrary to the rule, that Pazer does not
repeat itself in a verse; Cod. Erfurt. 2, and several older editions,
have for בחפניו more correctly בחפניו with Rebia. So much for the
interpunction. חפנים are properly not the two fists, for the fist - that
is, the hand gathered into a ball, pugnus - is called אגרף; while, on
the contrary, חפן (in all the three dialects) denotes the palm of the
hand, vola (vid., [Lev 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012).md); yet
here the hands are represented after they have seized the thing as shut,
and thus certainly as fists. The dual points to the dualism of the
streams of air produced by the disturbance of the equilibrium; he who
rules this movement has, as it were, the north or east wind in one
first, and the south or west wind in the other, to let it forth
according to his pleasure from this prison ([Isa
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#022).md). The third question is
explained by [Job 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#008.md); the שׂמלה
(from שׂמל, comprehendere) is a figure of the clouds which contain the
upper waters, as [Job 38:37](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#037.md), the
bottles of heaven. "All the ends of the earth" are as at five other
places, e.g., [Psa 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#028.md), the most
distant, most remote parts of the earth; the setting up of all these
most remote boundaries (margines) of the earth is equivalent to the
making fast and forming the limits to which the earth extends ([Psa
74:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#017).md), the determining of the compass
of the earth and the form of its figures. כּי תדע is in symphony with
[Job 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#005.md), cf. [Job
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#018.md). The question is here formed as
it is there, when Jahve brings home to the consciousness of Job human
weakness and ignorance. But there are here two possible significations
of the fourfold question. Either it aims at the answer: No man, but a
Being highly exalted above all creatures, so that the question מה־שּׁמו
\[what his name?\] refers to the name of this Being. Or the question is
primarily meant of men: What man has the ability? - if there is one,
then name him! In both cases מי עלה is not meant, after [Pro
24:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#028.md), in the modal sense, quis
ascenderit, but as the following ויּרד requires, in the nearest
indicative sense, quis ascendit. But the choice between these two
possible interpretations is very difficult. The first question is
historical: Who has gone to heaven and (as a consequence, then) come
down from it again? It lies nearest thus to interpret it according to
the consecutio temporum. By this interpretation, and this representation
of the going up before the descending again, the interrogator does not
appear to think of God, but in contrast to himself, to whom the divine
is transcendent, of some other man of whom the contrary is true. Is
there at all, he asks, a man who can comprehend and penetrate by his
power and his knowledge the heavens and the earth, the air and the
water, i.e., the nature and the inner condition of the visible and
invisible world, the quantity and extent of the elements, and the like?
Name to me this man, if thou knowest one, by his name, and designate him
to me exactly by his family - I would turn to him to learn from him what
I have hitherto striven in vain to find. But there is not such an one.
Thus: as I fell myself limited in my knowledge, so there is not at all
any man who can claim limitless knnen and kennen ability and knowledge.
Thus casually Aben Ezra explains, and also Rashi, Arama, and others, but
without holding fast to this in its purity; for in the interpretation of
the question, "Who hath ascended?" the reference to Moses is mixed up
with it, after the Midrash and Sohar (Parasha, ויקהל, to [Exo
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001).md), to pass by other obscurities
and difficulties introduced. Among the moderns, this explanation,
according to which all aims at the answer, "there is no man to whom this
appertains," has no exponent worth naming. And, indeed, as favourable as
is the quis ascendit in coelos ac rursus descendit, so unfavourable is
the quis constituit omnes terminos terrae, for this question appears not
as implying that it asks after the man who has accomplished this; but
the thought, according to all appearance, underlies it, that such an one
must be a being without an equal, after whose name inquiry is made. One
will then have to judge עלה and וירד after [Gen
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012.md); the ascending and descending
are compared to our German "auf und neider" up and down, for which we do
not use the phrase "nieder und auf," and is the expression of free,
expanded, unrestrained presence in both regions; perhaps, since וירד is
historical, as [Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md), the speaker
has the traditional origin of the creation in mind, according to which
the earth arose into being earlier than the starry heavens above. Thus
the four questions refer (as e.g., also [Isa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012).md) to Him who has done and who
does all that, to Him who is not Himself to be comprehended as His works
are, and as He shows Himself in the greatness and wonderfulness of
these, must be exalted above them all, and mysterious. If the inhabitant
of the earth looks up to the blue heavens streaming in the golden
sunlight, or sown with the stars of night; if he considers the
interchange of the seasons, and feels the sudden rising of the wind; if
he sees the upper waters clothed in fleecy clouds, and yet held fast
within them floating over him; if he lets his eye sweep the horizon all
around him to the ends of the earth, built up upon nothing in the open
world-space ([Job 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007).md): the
conclusion comes to him that he has before him in the whole the work of
an everywhere present Being, of an all-wise omnipotent Worker - it is
the Being whom he has just named as אל, the absolute Power, and as the
קדשׁים, exalted above all created beings, with their troubles and
limitations; but this knowledge gained vi causalitatis, vi eminentiae,
and vi negationis, does not satisfy yet his spirit, and does not bring
him so near to this Being as is to him a personal necessity, so that if
he can in some measure answer the fourfold מי, yet there always presses
upon him the question מה־שׁמו, what is his name, i.e., the name which
dissolves the secret of this Being above all beings, and unfolds the
mystery of the wonder above all wonders. That this Being must be a
person the fourfold מי presupposes; but the question, "What is his
name?" expresses the longing to know the name of this supernatural
personality, not any kind of name which is given to him by men, but the
name which covers him, which is the appropriate personal immediate
expression of his being. The further question, "And what the name of his
son?" denotes, according to Hitzig, that the inquirer strives after an
adequate knowledge, such as one may have of a human being. But he would
not have ventured this question if he did not suppose that God was not a
monas unity who was without manifoldness in Himself. The lxx translates:
ἣ τί ὄνομα τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτοῦ (בּנו), perhaps not without the influence
of the old synagogue reference testified to in the Midrash and Sohar of
בנו to Israel, God's first-born; but this interpretation is opposed to
the spirit of this חידה (intricate speech, enigma). Also in general the
interrogator cannot seek to know what man stands in this relation of a
son to the Creator of all things, for that would be an ethical question
which does not accord with this metaphysical one. Geier has combined
this ומה־שׁם־בנו with viii.; and that the interrogator, if he meant the
חכמה, ought to have used the phrase ומה־שׁם־בּתּו, says nothing against
this, for also in אמון, [Pro 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030.md),
whether it means foster-child or artifex, workmaster, the feminine
determination disappears. Not Ewald alone finds here the idea of the
Logos, as the first-born Son of God, revealing itself, on which at a
later time the Palestinian doctrine of מימרא דיהוה imprinted itself in
Alexandria;

(Note: Vid., Apologetik (1869), p. 432ff.)

but also J. D. Michaelis felt himself constrained to recognise here the
N.T. doctrine of the Son of God announcing itself from afar. And why
might not this be possible? The Rig-Veda contains two similar questions,
x. 81, 4: "Which was the primeval forest, or what the tree from which
one framed the heavens and the earth? Surely, ye wise men, ye ought in
your souls to make inquiry whereon he stood when he raised the wind!"
And i. 164, 4: "Who has seen the first-born? Where was the life, the
blood, the soul of the world? Who came thither to ask this from any one
who knew it?"

(Note: Cited by Lyra in Beweis des Glaubens Jahrg. 1869, p. 230. The
second of these passages is thus translated by Wilson (Rig-Veda-Sanhit,
London, 1854, vol. ii. p. 127): "Who has seen the primeval (being) at
the time of his being born? What is that endowed with substance which
the unsubstantial sustains? From earth are the breath and blood, but
where is the soul? Who may repair to the sage to ask this?")

Jewish interpreters also interpret בנו of the causa media of the
creation of the world. Arama, in his work עקדת יצחק, sect. xvi.,
suggests that by בנו we are to understand the primordial element, as the
Sankhya-philosophy understands by the first-born there in the Rig, the
Prakṛiti, i.e., the primeval material. R. Levi b. Gerson (Ralbag) comes
nearer to the truth when he explains בנו as meaning the cause caused by
the supreme cause, in other words: the principium principaiatum of the
creation of the world. We say: the inquirer meant the demiurgic might
which went forth from God, and which waited on the Son of God as a
servant in the creation of the world; the same might which in chap. 8 is
called Wisdom, and is described as God's beloved Son. But with the name
after which inquiry is made, the relation is as with the "more excellent
name than the angels," [Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md).

(Note: The Comm. there remarks: It is the heavenly whole name of the
highly exalted One, the שׁם המפורשׁ, nomen explicitum, which here on
this side has entered into no human heart, and can be uttered by no
human tongue, the ὄνομα ὁ οὑδεὶς οῖδεν εἰ μὴ ὁ αὐτός, [Rev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012)..md)

It is manifestly not the name בן, since the inquiry is made after the
name of the בן; but the same is the case also with the name חכמה, or,
since this does not harmonize, according to its grammatical gender, with
the form of the question, the name דבר (מימר); but it is the name which
belongs to the first and only-begotten Son of God, not merely according
to creative analogies, but according to His true being. The inquirer
would know God, the creator of the world, and His Son, the mediator in
the creation of the world, according to their natures. If thou knowest,
says he, turning himself to man, his equal, what the essential names of
both are, tell them to me! But who can name them! The nature of the
Godhead is hidden, as from the inquirer, so from every one else. On this
side of eternity it is beyond the reach of human knowledge.

The solemn confession introduced by נאם is now closed. Ewald sees herein
the discourse of a sceptical mocker at religion; and Elster, the
discourse of a meditating doubter; in [Pro
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md), and on, the answer ought then to
follow, which is given to one thus speaking: his withdrawal from the
standpoint of faith in the revelation of God, and the challenge to
subordinate his own speculative thinking to the authority of the word of
God. But this interpretation of the statement depends on the symbolical
rendering of the supposed personal names איתיאל and אכל, and, besides,
the dialogue is indicated by nothing; the beginning of the answer ought
to have been marked, like the beginning of that to which it is a reply.
The confession, 1b-4, is not that of a man who does not find himself in
the right condition, but such as one who is thirsting after God must
renounce: the thought of a man does not penetrate to the essence of God
([Job 11:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007).md); even the ways of God
remain inscrutable to man (Sir. 18:3; [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033).md); the Godhead remains, for our
thought, in immeasurable height and depth; and though a relative
knowledge of God is possible, yet the dogmatic thesis, Deum quidem
cognoscimus, sed non comprehendimus, i.e., non perfecte cognoscimus quia
est infinitus,

(Note: Vid., Luthardt's Kimpendium der Dogmatik, 27.)

even over against the positive revelation, remains unchanged. Thus
nothing is wanting to make [Pro 30:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md)
a complete whole; and what follows does not belong to that section as an
organic part of it.

[Proverbs 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 30:5</span></span>

5 Every word of Eloah is pure;

A shield is He for those who hide themselves in Him.

6 Add thou not to His words,

Lest He convict thee and thou becomest a liar.

Although the tetrastich is an independent proverb, yet it is connected
to the foregoing Neûm \[utterance, [Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md)\]. The more limited a man is in
his knowledge of God - viz. in that which presents itself to him lumine
naturae, - so much the more thankful must he be that God has revealed
Himself in history, and so much the more firmly has he to hold fast by
the pure word of the divine revelation. In the dependent relation of
[Pro 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md) to [Psa
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md) ([Sa2
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#031).md), and of [Pro
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006.md) to [Deu
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002.md), there is no doubt the
self-testimony of God given to Israel, and recorded in the book of the
Tôra, is here meant. כּל־אמרת is to be judged after πᾶσα γραφή, [Ti2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md), not: every declaration of God,
wherever promulgated, but: every declaration within the revelation lying
before us. The primary passage [Psa
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md) has not כל here, but, instead of
it, לכל החסים, and instead of אמרת אלוהּ it has יהוה 'אם; his change of
the name of Jahve is also not favourable to the opinion that [Pro
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md). is a part of the Neûm, viz.,
that it is the answer thereto. The proverb in this contains traces of
the Book of Job, with which in many respects that Neûm harmonizes; in
the Book of Job, אלוהּ (with שׁדּי) is the prevailing name of God;
whereas in the Book of Proverbs it occurs only in the passage before us.
Mhlau, p. 41, notes it as an Arabism. צרף (Arab. ṣaraf, to turn, to
change) is the usual word for the changing process of smelting; צרוּף
signifies solid, pure, i.e., purified by separating: God's word is,
without exception, like pure, massive gold. Regarding חסה, to hide
oneself, vid., under [Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md);: God
is a shield for those who make Him, as revealed in His word, their
refuge. The part. חסה occurs, according to the Masora, three times
written defectively, - [Pro 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#032.md);
[Sa2 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#031.md); [Neh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#007.md); in the passage before us it is to
be written לחוסים; the proverbs of Agur and Lemuel have frequently the
plena scriptio of the part. act. Kal, as well as of the fut. Kal, common
to the Book of Job (vid., Mhlau, p. 65).

In 6a, after Aben Ezra's Moznajim 2b (11b of Heidenheim's edition), and
Zachoth 53a (cf. Lipmann's ed.), and other witnesses (vid., Norzi), t sp
(the ף with dagesh) is to be written, - the Cod. Jaman. and others
defect. without ו, - not tôsf; for, since תּוסף ([Exo
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#028).md) is yet further abbreviated in
this way, it necessarily loses

(Note: That both Shevas in tôsp are quiesc., vid., Kimchi, Michlol 155 a
b, who is finally decided as to this. That the word should be read
tôspe'al is the opinion of Chagg in הנוח 'ס (regarding the quiesc.
letters), p. 6 of the Ed. by Dukes-Ewald.)

the aspiration of the tenuis, as in ילדתּ (= ילדת). The words of God are
the announcements of His holy will, measured by His wisdom; they are
then to be accepted as they are, and to be recognised and obeyed. He who
adds anything to them, either by an overstraining of them or by
repressing them, will not escape the righteous judgment of God: God will
convict him of falsifying His word (הוכיח, [Psa
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021); only here with ב of the obj..md),
and expose him as a liar - viz. by the dispensations which unmask the
falsifier as such, and make manifest the falsehood of his doctrines as
dangerous to souls and destructive to society. An example of this is
found in the kingdom of Israel, in the destruction of which the curse of
the human institution of its state religion, set up by Jeroboam, had no
little share. Also the Jewish traditional law, although in itself
necessary for the carrying over of the law into the praxis of private
and public life, falls under the Deuteron. prohibition - which the poet
here repeats - so far as it claimed for itself the same divine authority
as that of the written law, and so far as it hindered obedience to the
law - by the straining-at-a-gnat policy - and was hostile to piety. Or,
to adduce an example of an addition more dogmatic than legal, what a
fearful impulse was given to fleshly security by that overstraining of
the promises in Gen 17, which were connected with circumcision by the
tradition, "the circumcised come not into hell," or by the overstraining
of the prerogative attributed by Paul, [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md)., to his people according to the
Scriptures, in the principle, "All Israelites have a part in the future
world!" Regarding the accentuation of the perf. consec. after פּן, vid.,
at [Psa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md). The penultima accent is
always in pausa (cf. [Pro 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md) and
[Pro 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010).md).

[Proverbs 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 30:7</span></span>

In what now follows, the key-note struck in [Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md) is continued. There follows a
prayer to be kept in the truth, and to be preserved in the middle state,
between poverty and riches. It is a Mashal-ode, vid., vol. i. p. 12. By
the first prayer, "vanity and lies keep far from me," it is connected
with the warning of [Pro 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006.md).

7 Two things I entreat from Thee,

Refuse them not to me before I die.

8 Vanity and lies keep far away from me

Poverty and riches give me not:

Cause me to eat the bread which is allotted to me,

9 Lest in satiety I deny,

And say: Who is Jahve?

And lest, in becoming poor, I steal,

And profane the name of my God.

We begin with the settlement and explanation of the traditional
punctuation. A monosyllable like שׁוא receives, if Legarmeh, always
Mehuppach Legarmeh, while, on the contrary, the poly-syllable אשׂבּע has
Asla Legarmeh. אל־תּתּן־לי, with double Makkeph and with Gaja in the
third syllable before the tone (after the Metheg-Setzung, 28), is
Ben-Asher's; whereas Ben-Naphtali prefers the punctuation אל־תּתּן לי
(vid., Baer's Genesis, p. 79, note 3). Also פּן־אשׂבּע has (cf.
פּן־ישׁתּה, [Pro 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#005).md) Makkeph, and on
the antepenultima Gaja (vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 32). The perf. consec.
וכחשׁתּי has on the ult. the disjunctive Zinnor (Sarka), which always
stands over the final letter; but that the ult. is also to be accented,
is shown by the counter-tone Metheg, which is to be given to the first
syllable. Also ואמרתּי has in correct Codd., e.g., Cod. 1294, the
correct ultima toning of a perf. consec.; Kimchi in the Michlol 6b, as
well as Aben Ezra in both of his Grammars, quotes only וגנבתּי ותפשׂתּי
as toned on the penult. That וגנבתּי cannot be otherwise toned on
account of the pausal accent, has been already remarked under 6b; the
word, besides, belongs to the סף''פתתין בא, i.e., to those which
preserve their Pathach unlengthened by one of the greater disjunctives;
the Athnach has certainly in the three so-called metrical books only the
disjunctive form of the Zakeph of the prose books. So much as to the
form of the text.

As to its artistic form, this prayer presents itself to us as the first
of the numerical proverbs, under the "Words" of Agur, who delighted in
this form of proverb. The numerical proverb is a brief discourse, having
a didactic end complete in itself, which by means of numerals gives
prominence to that which it seeks to bring forward. There are two kinds
of these. The more simple form places in the first place only one
numeral, which is the sum of that which is to be brought forth
separately: the numerical proverb of one cipher; to this class belong,
keeping out of view the above prayer, which if it did not commence a
series of numerical proverbs does not deserve this technical name on
account of the low ciphers: [Pro
30:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024.md), with the cipher 4; Sir. 25:1
and 2, with the cipher 3. Similar to the above prayer are [Job
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#020.md)., [Isa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019.md); but these are not numerical
proverbs, for they are not proverbs. The more artistic kind of numerical
proverb has two ciphers: the two-ciphered numerical proverb we call the
sharpened (pointed) proverb. Of such two-ciphered numerical proverbs the
"words" of Agur contain four, and the whole Book of Proverbs, reckoning
[Pro 6:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016.md), five - this ascending
numerical character belongs to the popular saying, [Kg2
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#032.md); [Job
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029.md); [Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006.md), and is found bearing the stamp
of the artistic distich outside of the Book of Proverbs, [Psa
62:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#012.md); [Job
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014.md); [Job
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#005.md); [Job
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md), and particularly Amos 1:3-2:6.
According to this scheme, the introduction of Agur's prayer should be:

אחת שׁאלתּי מאתּך

וּשׁתּים אל־תּמנע ממּנּי בּטרם אמוּת

and it could take this form, for the prayer expresses two requests, but
dwells exclusively on the second. A twofold request he presents to God,
these two things he wishes to be assured of on this side of death; for
of these he stands in need, so as to be able when he dies to look back
on the life he has spent, without the reproaches of an accusing
conscience. The first thing he asks is that God would keep far from him
vanity and lying words. שׁוא (= שׁוא, from שׁוא = שׁאה, to be waste,
after the form מות) is either that which is confused, worthless, untrue,
which comes to us from without (e.g., [Job
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#005).md), or dissoluteness, hollowness,
untruthfulness of disposition (e.g., [Psa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004).md); it is not to be decided whether
the suppliant is influenced by the conception thus from within or from
without, since דבר־כּזב \[a word of falsehood\] may be said by himself
as well as to him, a falsehood can intrude itself upon him. It is almost
more probable that by שׁוא he thought of the misleading power of
God-estranged, idolatrous thought and action; and by דבר־כזב, of lying
words, with which he might be brought into sympathy, and by which he
might ruin himself and others. The second petition is that God would
give him neither poverty (ראשׁ, vid., [Pro
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004).md) nor riches, but grant him for
his sustenance only the bread of the portion destined for him. The Hiph.
הטריף (from טרף, to grind, viz., the bread with the teeth) means to give

(Note: The Venet. translates, according to Villoison, θέρψον με; but the
MS has, according to Gebhardt, θρέψον.)

anything, as טרף, with which, 31:15, נתן חק is parallel: to present a
fixed piece, a definite portion of sustenance. חק, [Gen
47:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#022.md), the portion assigned as
nourishment; cf. [Job 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014.md) חקּי, the
decree determined regarding me. Accordingly, חקּי לחם does not mean the
bread appropriately measured out for me (like ἄρτος ἐπιούσιος, that
which is required for οὐσία, subsistence), but the bread appropriate for
me, determined for me according to the divine plan. Fleischer compares
(Arab.) ratab and marsaum, which both in a similar way designate a fixed
sustentation portion. And why does he wish to be neither poor nor rich?
Because in both extremes lie moral dangers: in riches, the temptation to
deny God (which 'כּחשׁ בּה signifies, in the later Heb. כּפר בּעקּר, to
deny the fundamental truth; cf. (Arab.) kafar, unbelieving), whom one
flowing in superabundance forgets, and of whom one in his
self-indulgence desires to know nothing ([Job
21:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#014.md); [Job
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#016)..md); in poverty, the temptation is
to steal and to blaspheme the name of God, viz., by murmuring and
disputing, or even by words of blasphemy; for one who is in despair
directs the outbreaks of his anger against God ([Isa
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#021).md), and curses Him as the cause of
His misfortune ([Rev 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#011.md), [Rev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021).md). The question of godless
haughtiness, מי יהוח, the lxx improperly change into מי יראה, τίς με
ὁρᾶ. Regarding נורשׁ, to grow poor, or rather, since only the fut. Niph.
occurs in this sense, regarding יוּרשׁ, vid., at [Pro
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#013.md).

That the author here, by blaspheming (grasping at) the name of God,
especially thinks on that which the Tôra calls "cursing (קלּל) God," and
particularly "blaspheming the name of the Lord," [Lev
24:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#015.md), is to be concluded from the
two following proverbs, which begin with the catchword קלל:

[Proverbs 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 30:10</span></span>

10 Calumniate not a servant with his master,

Lest he curse thee, and thou must atone for it.

Incorrectly Ewald: entice not a servant to slander against his master;
and Hitzig: "Make not a servant tattle regarding his master." It is true
that the Poel לושׁן (to pierce with the tongue, lingu petere) occurs
twice in the sense of to calumniate; but that הלשׁין means nothing else,
is attested by the post-bibl. Hebrew; the proverb regarding schismatics
(בּרכּת המּינים) in the Jewish Schemone-Esre (prayer of the eighteen
benedictions) began with ולמלשינים, "and to the calumniators"
(delatoribus). Also in the Arab. âlsana signifies pertulit verba
alicujus ad alterum, to make a babbler, rapporteur (Fleischer). That the
word also here is not to be otherwise interpreted, is to be concluded
from אל with the causative rendering. Rightly Symmachus, μὴ διαβάλῃς;
Theodotion, μὴ καταλαλήσῃς; and according to the sense also, Jerome, ne
accuses; the Venet. μὴ καταμηνύσῃς (give not him); on the contrary,
Luther, verrate nicht \[betray not\], renders הלשׁין with the lxx, Syr.
in the sense of the Aram. אשׁלם and the Arab. âslam (tradere, prodere).
One should not secretly accuse ([Psa
101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005).md) a servant with his master, and
in that lies the character of slander (לשׁון הרע) when one puts
suspicion upon him, or exaggerates the actual facts, and generally makes
the person suspected - one thereby makes a man, whose lot in itself is
not a happy one, at length and perhaps for ever unhappy, and thereby he
brings a curse on himself. But it is no matter of indifference to be the
object of the curse of a man whom one has unrighteously and unjustly
overwhelmed in misery: such a curse is not without its influence, for it
does not fruitlessly invoke the righteous retribution of God, and thus
one has sorrowfully to atone for the wanton sins of the tongue
(veaschāmta, for ve-aschamtá as it is would be without pause).

[Proverbs 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 30:11</span></span>

There now follows a Priamel,

(Note: Cf. vol. i. p. 13. The name (from praeambulum) given to a
peculiar form of popular gnomic poetry which prevailed in Germany from
the 12th (e.g., the Meistersinger or Minstrel Sparvogel) to the 16th
century, but was especially cultivated during the 14th and 15th
centuries. Its peculiarity consisted in this, that after a series of
antecedents or subjects, a briefly-expressed consequent or predicate was
introduced as the epigrammatic point applicable to all these antecedents
together. Vid., Erschenburg's Denkmlern altdeutscher Dichtkinst, Bremen
1799.)

the first line of which is, by יקלל, connected with the יקללך of the
preceding distich:

11 A generation that curseth their father,

And doth not bless their mother;

12 A generation pure in their own eyes,

And yet not washed from their filthiness;

13 A generation - how haughty their eyes,

And their eyelids lift themselves up;

14 A generation whose teeth are swords and their jaw teeth knives

To devour the poor from the earth and the needy from the midst of men.

Ewald translates: O generation! but that would have required the word,
13a, הדּור ([Jer 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031).md), and one would
have expected to have found something mentioned which the generation
addressed were to take heed to; but it is not so. But if "O generation!"
should be equivalent to "O regarding the generation!" then הוי ought to
have introduced the sentence. And if we translate, with Luther: There is
a generation, etc., then ישׁ is supplied, which might drop out, but
could not be omitted. The lxx inserts after ἔκγονον the word κακόν, and
then renders what follows as pred. - a simple expedient, but worthless.
The Venet. does not need this expedient, for it renders γενεὰ τὸν πατέρα
αὐτοῦ βλασφημέσει; but then the order of the words in 11a would have
been דור יקלל אביו; and in 12a, after the manner of a subst. clause, דור
טהור בעיניו הוא, one sees distinctly, from [Pro
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#013.md) and [Pro
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014.md), that what follows דור is to be
understood, not as a pred., but as an attributive clause. As little can
we interpret [Pro 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014.md), with
Lwenstein, as pred. of the three subj., "it is a generation whose teeth
are swords;" that would at least have required the words דור הוא; but
[Pro 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014.md) is not at all a judgment
valid for all the three subjects. The Targ. and Jerome translate
correctly, as we above;

(Note: The Syr. begins 11a as if הוי were to be supplied.)

but by this rendering there are four subjects in the preamble, and the
whole appears, since the common pred. is wanting, as a mutilated
Priamel. Perhaps the author meant to say: it is such a generation that
encompasses us; or: such is an abomination to Jahve; for דור is a
Gesamtheit = totality, generation of men who are bound together by
contemporary existence, or homogeneity, or by both, but always a
totality; so that these [Pro 30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#011.md),
might describe quatuor detestabilia genera hominum (C. B. Michaelis),
and yet one generatio, which divide among themselves these four vices,
of blackest ingratitude, loathsome self-righteousness, arrogant
presumption, and unmerciful covetousness. Similar is the description
given in the Mishna Sota ix. 14, of the character of the age in which
the Messiah appeared. "The appearance of this age," thus it concludes,
"is like the appearance of a dog; a son is not ashamed before his
father; to whom will we then look for help? To our Father in heaven!"

(Note: Cf. also Ali b. Abi Tleb's dark description, beginning with hadha
alzman (this age), Zur allg. Char. der arab. Poesie (1870), p. 54f.)

The undutifulness of a child is here placed first. To curse one's
parents is, after [Exo 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017.md), cf. [Pro
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010.md), a crime worthy of death; "not
to bless," is here, per litoten, of the same force as קלּל to curse. The
second characteristic, [Pro 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#012.md), is
wicked blindness as to one's judgment of himself. The lxx coarsely, but
not bad: τὴν δ ̓ ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀπένιψεν. Of such darkness one says:
sordes suas putat olere cinnama. רחץ is not the abbreviated part.
(Stuart), as e.g., [Exo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md), but the
finite, as e.g., [Hos 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006.md).

In 13a the attributive clause forms itself, so as to express the
astonishing height of arrogance, into an exclamation: a generation, how
lofty are their eyes (cf. e.g., [Pro
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#017), עינים רמות.md)! to which, as usual,
it is simply added: and his eyelids (palpebrae) lift themselves up; in
Lat., the lifting up of the eyebrow as an expression of haughtiness is
described by elatum (superbum) supercilium.

The fourth characteristic is insatiable covetousness, which does not
spare even the poor, and preys upon them, the helpless and the
defenceless: they devour them as one eats bread, [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md). The teeth, as the instruments of
eating, are compared to swords and knives, as at [Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md) to spears and arrows. With שׁנּיו
there is interchanged, as at [Job
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#017.md); [Jon
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006.md), מתלּעתיו (not 'מת, as Norzi
writes, contrary to Metheg-Setzung, 37, according to which Gaja, with
the servant going before, is inadmissible), transposed from מלתּעתיו,
[Psa 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007.md), from לתע, to strike,
pierce, bite. The designation of place, מארץ, "from the earth" (which
also, in pausa, is not modified into מארץ), and מאדם, "from the midst of
men," do not belong to the obj.: those who belong to the earth, to
mankind (vid., [Psa 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018).md), for thus
interpreted they would be useless; but to the word of action: from the
earth, out from the midst of men away, so that they disappear from
thence ([Amo 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004).md). By means of fine
but cobweb combinations, Hitzig finds Amalek in this fourfold proverb.
But it is a portrait of the times, like [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), and certainly without any
national stamp.

[Proverbs 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 30:15</span></span>

With the characteristic of insatiableness [Pro
30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#011.md) closes, and there follows an
apophthegma de quatuor insatiabilibus quae ideo comparantur cum
sanguisuga (C. B. Michaelis). We translate the text here as it lies
before us:

15 The ‛Alûka hath two daughters: Give! Give!

Three of these are never satisfied;

Four say not: Enough!

16 The under-world and the closing of the womb;

The earth is not satisfied with water;

And the fire saith not: Enough!

We begin with Masoretic externalities. The first ב in הב is Beth
minusculum; probably it had accidentally this diminutive form in the
original MSS, to which the Midrash (cf. Sepher Taghin ed. Bargs, 1866,
p. 47) has added absurd conceits. This first הב has Pasek after it,
which in this case is servant to the Olewejored going before, according
to the rule Thorath Emeth, p. 24, here, as at [Psa
85:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#009.md), Mehuppach. The second הב, which
of itself alone is the representative of Olewejored, has in Hutter, as
in the Cod. Erfurt 2, and Cod. 2 of the Leipzig Public Library, the
pausal punctuation הב (cf. קח, [Sa1
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010).md), but which is not sufficiently
attested. Instead of לא־אמרוּ, 15b, לא אמרוּ, and instead of לא־אמרה f,
16b, לא אמרה are to be written; the Zinnorith removes the Makkeph,
according to Thorath Emeth, p. 9, Accentuationssystem, iv. 2. Instead of
מים, 16a, only Jablonski, as Mhlau remarks, has מים; but incorrectly,
since Athnach, after Olewejored, has no pausal force (vid., Thorath
Emeth, p. 37). All that is without any weight as to the import of the
words. But the punctuation affords some little service for the setting
aside of a view of Rabbenu Tam (vid., Tosaphoth to Aboda zara 17a, and
Erubin 19a), which has been lately advocated by Lwenstein. That view is,
that ‛Alûka is the name of a wise man, not Solomon's, because the
Pesikta does not reckon this among the names of Solomon, nor yet a name
of hell, because it is not, in the Gemara, numbered among the names of
Gehinnom. Thus לעלוּקה would be a superscription, like לדוד and לשׁלמה,
[Psa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md); [Psa
72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md), provided with Asla Legarmeh. But
this is not possible, for the Asla Legarmeh, at [Psa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md) and [Psa
72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md), is the transformation of
Olewejored, inadmissible on the first word of the verse
(Accentuationssystem, xix. 1); but no Olewejored can follow such an Asla
Legarmeh, which has the force of an Olewejored, as after this לעלוקה,
which the accentuation then does not regard as the author's name given
as a superscription. עלוּקה is not the name of a person, and generally
not a proper name, but a generic name of certain traditional
signification. "One must drink no water" - says the Gemara Aboda zara
12b - "out of a river or pond, nor (immediately) with his mouth, nor by
means of his hand; he who, nevertheless, does it, his blood comes on his
own head, because of the danger. What danger? סכּנת עלוּקה," i.e., the
danger of swallowing a leech. The Aram. also designates a leech by
עלוּקא (cf. e.g., Targ. Ps. 12:9: hence the godless walk about like the
leech, which sucks the blood of men), and the Arab. by 'alaḳ (n. unit.
'alaḳat), as the word is also rendered here by the Aram. and Arab.
translators. Accordingly, all the Greeks render it by βδέλλη; Jerome, by
sanguisuga (Rashi, sangsue); also Luther's Eigel is not the Igel
erinaceus \[hedgehog\], but the Egel, i.e., as we now designate it, the
Blutegel \[leech\], or (less correctly) Blutigel. עלוּקה is the fem. of
the adj. עלוּק, attached to, which meaning, together with the whole
verbal stem, the Arab. has preserved (vid., Mhlau's Mittheilung des Art.
'aluka aus dem Kamus, p. 42).

(Note: Nldeke has remarked, with reference to Mhlau's Monographie, that
‛aluḳa, in the sense of tenacious (tenax), is also found in Syr.
(Geopon. xiii. 9, xli. 26), and that generally the stem עלק, to cleave,
to adhere, is more common in Aram. than one would suppose. But this,
however common in Arab., is by no means so in Syr.; and one may affirm
that, among other Arabisms found in the Proverbs of Agur, the word
‛Alûka has decidedly an Arab. sound.)

But if, now, the ‛Alûka is the leech,

(Note: In Sanscrit the leech is called galaukas (masc.) or galaukâ
(fem.), i.e., the inhabitant of the water (from gala, water, and ôkas,
dwelling). Ewald regards this as a transformation of the Semitic name.)

which are then its two daughters, to which is here given the name הב הב,
and which at the same time have this cry of desire in their mouths?
Grotius and others understand, by the two daughters of the leech, the
two branches of its tongue; more correctly: the double-membered overlip
of its sucker. C. B. Michaelis thinks that the greedy cry, "Give! Give!"
is personified: voces istae concipiuntur ut hirudinis filiae, quas ex se
gignat et velut mater sobolem impense diligat. But since this does not
satisfy, symbolical interpretations of ‛Aluka have been resorted to. The
Talmud, Aboda zara 17a, regards it as a name of hell. In this sense it
is used in the language of the Pijut (synagogue poetry).

(Note: So says e.g., Salomo ha-Babli, in a Zulath of the first
Chanukka-Sabbats (beginning אין צוּר חלף): יקדוּ כּהבהבי עלק, they burn
like the flames of hell.)

If ‛Alûka is hell, then fancy has the widest room for finding an answer
to the question, What are the two daughters? The Talmud supposes that
רשׁות (the worldly domination) and מינות (heresy) are meant. The
Church-fathers also, understanding by ‛Alûka the power of the devil,
expatiated in such interpretations. Of the same character are Calmet's
interpretation, that sanguisuga is a figure of the mala cupiditas, and
its twin-daughters are avaritia and ambitio. The truth lying in all
these is this, that here there must be some kind of symbol. But if the
poet meant, by the two daughters of the ‛Alûka, two beings or things
which he does not name, then he kept the best of his symbol to himself.
And could he use ‛Alûka, this common name for the leech, without further
intimation, in any kind of symbolical sense? The most of modern
interpreters do nothing to promote the understanding of the word, for
they suppose that ‛Alûka, from its nearest signification, denotes a
demoniacal spirit of the character of a vampire, like the Dakin of the
Indians, which nourish themselves on human flesh; the ghouls of the
Arabs and Persians, which inhabit graveyards, and kill and eat men,
particularly wanderers in the desert; in regard to which it is to be
remarked, that (Arab.) ‛awlaḳ is indeed a name for a demon, and that
al‛aluwaḳ, according to the Kamus, is used in the sense of alghwal. Thus
Dathe, Dderlein, Ziegler, Umbreit; thus also Hitzig, Ewald, and others.
Mhlau, while he concurs in this understanding of the word, and now
throwing open the question, Which, then, are the two daughters of the
demoness ‛Alûka? finds no answer to it in the proverb itself, and
therefore accepts of the view of Ewald, since 15b-16, taken by
themselves, form a fully completed whole, that the line 'לעלוקה וגו is
the beginning of a numerical proverb, the end of which is wanting. We
acknowledge, because of the obscurity - not possibly aimed at by the
author himself - in which the two daughters remain, the fragmentary
characters of the proverb of the ‛Alûka; Stuart also does this, for he
regards it as brought out of a connection in which it was intelligible -
but we believe that the line 'שׁלושׁ וגו is an original formal part of
this proverb. For the proverb forming, according to Mhlau's judgment, a
whole rounded off:

שׁלושׁ הנה לא תשׂבענה

ארבע לא אמרו הון

שׁאול ועצר רחם

ארץ לא שׂבעה מים

ואשׁ לא אמרה הון

contains a mark which makes the original combination of these five lines
improbable. Always where the third is exceeded by the fourth, the step
from the third to the fourth is taken by the connecting Vav: [Pro
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018.md), וארבע; [Pro
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021.md), ותחת ארבע; [Pro
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#029.md), וארבעה. We therefore conclude
that 'ארבע לא וגו is the original commencement of independent proverb.
This proverb is:

Four things say not: Enough!

The under-world and the closing of the womb \[i.e., unfruitful womb\] -

The earth is not satisfied with water,

And the fire says not: Enough!

a tetrastich more acceptable and appropriate than the Arab. proverb
(Freytag, Provv. iii. p. 61, No. 347): "three things are not satisfied
by three: the womb, and wood by fire, and the earth by rain;" and, on
the other hand, it is remarkable to find it thus clothed in the Indian
language,

(Note: That not only natural productions, but also ideas and literary
productions (words, proverbs, knowledge), were conveyed from the Indians
to the Semites, and from the Semites to the Indians, on the great
highways by sea and land, is a fact abundantly verified. There is not in
this, however, any means of determining the situation of Massa.)

as given in the Hitopadesa (p. 67 of Lassen's ed.), and in
Pantschatantra, i. 153 (ed. of Kosegarten):

nâgnis tṛpjati kâshṭhânân nâpagânân mahôdadhih

nântakah sarvabhûtânân na punsân vâmalocanâh.

Fire is not sated with wood, nor the ocean with the streams,

Nor death with all the living, nor the beautiful-eyed with men.

As in the proverb of Agur the 4 falls into 2 + 2, so also in this Indian
sloka. In both, fire and the realm of death (ântaka is death as the
personified "end-maker") correspond; and as there the womb and the
earth, so here feminarium cupiditas and the ocean. The parallelizing of
ארץ and רחם is after passages such as [Psa
139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015.md); [Job
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md) (cf. also [Pro
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#016.md); [Num
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007.md); [Isa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001).md); that of שׁאול and אשׁ is to be
judged of

(Note: The parallelizing of רחם and שׁאול, Berachoth 15b, is not
directly aimed at by the poet.)

after passages such as [Deu 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022.md),
[Isa 56:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md) :24. That לא אמרו הון
repeats itself in לא אמרה הון is now, as we render the proverb
independently, much more satisfactory than if it began with 'שׁלושׁ וגו:
it rounds itself off, for the end returns into the beginning. Regarding
הון, vid., [Pro 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#013.md). From הוּן, to be
light, it signifies living lightly; ease, superabundance, in that which
renders life light or easy. "Used accusatively, and as an exclamation,
it is equivalent to plenty! enough! It is used in the same sense in the
North African Arab. brrakat (spreading out, fulness). Wetzstein remarks
that in Damascus lahôn i.e., hitherto, is used in the sense of ḥajah,
enough; and that, accordingly, we may attempt to explain הון of our Heb.
language in the sense of (Arab.) hawn haddah, i.e., here the end of it!"
(Mhlau).

But what do we now make of the two remaining lines of the proverb of the
‛Alûka? The proverb also in this division of two lines is a fragment.
Ewald completes it, for to the one line, of which, according to his
view, the fragment consists, he adds two:

The bloodsucker has two daughters, "Hither! hither!"

Three saying, "Hither, hither, hither the blood,

The blood of the wicked child."

A proverb of this kind may stand in the O.T. alone: it sounds as if
quoted from Grimm's Mhrchen, and is a side-piece to Zappert's
altdeutsch. Schlummerliede. Cannot the mutilation of the proverb be
rectified in a less violent way without any self-made addition? If this
is the case, that in [Pro 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md) and
[Pro 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#016.md), which now form one
proverb, there are two melted together, only the first of which lies
before us in a confused form, then this phenomenon is explained by
supposing that the proverb of the ‛Alûka originally stood in this form:

The ‛Alûka has two daughters: Give! give! -

The under-world and the closing of the womb;

There are three that are never satisfied.

Thus completed, this tristich presents itself as the original side-piece
of the lost tetrastich, beginning with ארבע. One might suppose that if
שׁאול and עצר רחם have to be regarded as the daughters of the ‛Alûka,
which Hitzig and also Zckler have recognised, then there exists no
reason for dividing the one proverb into two. Yet the taking of them as
separate is necessary, for this reason, because in the fourth, into
which it expands, the ‛Alûka is altogether left out of account. But in
the above tristich it is taken into account, as was to be expected, as
the mother with her children. This, that sheol (שׁאול is for the most
part fem.), and the womb (רחם = רחם, which is fem., [Jer
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#017).md) to which conception is denied,
are called, on account of their greediness, the daughters of the ‛Alûka,
is to be understood in the same way as when a mountain height is called,
[Isa 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md), a horn of the son of oil. In
the Arab., which is inexhaustibly rich in such figurative names, a man
is called "a son of the clay (limi);" a thief, "a son of the night;" a
nettle, "the daughter of fire." The under-world and a closed womb have
the ‛Alûka nature; they are insatiable, like the leech. It is
unnecessary to interpret, as Zckler at last does, ‛Alûka as the name of
a female demon, and the לילית, "daughters," as her companions. It may be
adduced in favour of this view that לעלוּקה is without the article,
after the manner of a proper name. But is it really without the article?
Such a doubtful case we had before us at [Pro
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md). As yet only Bttcher, 394, has
entered on this difficulty of punctuation. We compare [Gen
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#027.md), בּעבדה; [Kg1
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032.md), לעגלים; [Ch1
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#007.md), בּעגלה; and consequently also
[Psa 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md), לעשׁוּקים; thus the
assimilating force of the Chateph appears here to have changed the
syntactically required ל and בּ into ל and בּ. But also supposing that
עלוּקה in לעלוּקה is treated as a proper name, this is explained from
the circumstance that the leech is not meant here in the natural history
sense of the word, but as embodied greediness, and is made a person, one
individual being. Also the symbol of the two daughters is opposed to the
mythological character of the ‛Alûka. The imper. הב, from יהב, occurs
only here and at [Dan 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#017) (= תּן.md),
and in the bibl. Heb. only with the intentional āh, and in inflection
forms. The insatiableness of sheol ([Pro
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020).md) is described by Isa; [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md); and Rachel, [Gen
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#001.md), with her "Give me children," is
an example of the greediness of the "closed-up womb" ([Gen
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#018).md). The womb of a childless wife
is meant, which, because she would have children, the nuptiae never
satisfy; or also of one who, because she does not fear to become
pregnant, invites to her many men, and always burns anew with lust. "In
Arab. 'aluwaḳ means not only one fast bound to her husband, but,
according to Wetzstein, in the whole of Syria and Palestine, the
prostitute, as well as the κίναιδοι, are called 'ulak (plur. 'alwak),
because they obtrude themselves and hold fast to their victim" (Mhlau).
In the third line, the three: the leech, hell, and the shut womb, are
summarized: tira sunt quae non satiantur. Thus it is to be translated
with Fleischer, not with Mhlau and others, tira haec non satiantur.
"These three" is expressed in Heb. by שׁלשׁ־אלּה, [Exo
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#011), or אלּה(ה.md) שׁלשׁת, [Sa2
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#022.md); הנּה (which, besides, does not
signify haec, but illa) is here, taken correctly, the pred., and
represents in general the verb of being ([Isa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019).md), vid., at [Pro
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016.md). Zckler finds the point of the
proverb in the greediness of the unfruitful womb, and is of opinion that
the poet purposely somewhat concealed this point, and gave to his
proverb thereby the enhanced attraction of the ingenious. But the
tetrastich 'אברע וגו shows that hell, which is compared to fire, and the
unfruitful womb, to which the parched and thirsty earth is compared,
were placed by the poet on one and the same line; it is otherwise with
[Pro 30:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018.md), but where that point is
nothing less than concealed.

[Proverbs 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 30:17</span></span>

The proverb of the ‛Alûka is the first of the proverbs founded on the
figure of an animal among the "words" of Agur. It is now followed by
another of a similar character:

17 An eye that mocketh at his father,

And despiseth obedience to his mother:

The ravens of the brook shall pluck it out,

And the young eagles shall eat it.

If "an eye," and not "eyes," are spoken of here, this is accounted for
by the consideration that the duality of the organ falls back against
the unity of the mental activity and mental expression which it serves
(cf. Psychol. p. 234). As haughtiness reveals itself ([Pro
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#013).md) in the action of the eyes, so
is the eye also the mirror of humble subordination, and also of
malicious scorn which refuses reverence and subjection to father and
mother. As in German the verbs \[verspotten, spotten, hhnen,
hohnsprechen signifying to mock at or scorn may be used with the accus.,
genit., or dat., so also לעג \[to deride\] and בּוּז \[to despise\] may
be connected at pleasure with either an accusative object or a dative
object. Ben-Chajim, Athias, van der Hooght, and others write תּלעג;
Jablonski, Michaelis, Lwenstein, תּלעג, Mhlau, with Norzi, accurately,
תּלעג, with Munach, like תּבחר, [Psa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005.md); the writing of Ben-Asher

(Note: The Gaja has its reason in the Zinnor that follows, and the
Munach in the syllable beginning with a moveable Sheva; תּלעג with
Scheva quiesc. must, according to rule, receive Mercha, vid., Thorath
Emeth, p. 26.)

is תּלעג, with Gaja, Chateph, and Munach. The punctuation of ליקהת is
more fluctuating. The word לקהת (e.g., Cod. Jaman.) may remain out of
view, for the Dag. dirimens in ק stands here as firmly as at [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), cf. [Psa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010.md). But it is a question whether
one has to write ליקּהת with Yod quiesc. (regarding this form of
writing, preferred by Ben-Naphtali, the Psalmen-Comm. under [Psa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010.md), in both Edd.; Luzzatto's Gramm.
193; Baer's Genesis, p. 84, note 2; and Heidenheim's Pentateuch, with
the text-crit. Comm. of Jekuthil ha-Nakdans, under [Gen
47:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#017.md); [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md), as it is found in Kimchi,
Michlol 45a, and under יקה, and as also Norzi requires, or ליקּהת (as
e.g., Cod. Erfurt 1), which appears to be the form adopted by Ben-Asher,
for it is attested

(Note: Kimchi is here no authority, for he contradicts himself regarding
such word-forms. Thus, regarding ויללת, [Jer
25:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#036.md), in Michlol 87b, and under ילל.
The form also wavers between כּיתרון and כּיתרון, [Ecc
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013.md). The Cod. Jaman. has here the Jod
always quiesc.)

as such by Jekuthil under [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md),
and also expressly as such by an old Masora-Cod. of the Erfurt Library.
Lwenstein translates, "the weakness of the mother." Thus after Rashi,
who refers the word to קהה, to draw together, and explains it, [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), "collection;" but in the
passage before us, understands it of the wrinkles on the countenance of
the aged mother. Nachmani (Ramban) goes still further, giving to the
word, at [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), everywhere the
meaning of weakness and frailty. Aben Ezra also, and Gersuni (Ralbag),
do not go beyond the meaning of a drawing together; and the lxx, with
the Aram., who all translate the word by senectus, have also קהה in the
sense of to become dull, infirm (certainly not the Aethiopic leheḳa, to
become old, weak through old age). But Kimchi, whom the Venet. and
Luther

(Note: Jerome translates, et qui despicit partum matris suae. To partus
there separates itself to him here the signification expectatio, [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), resting on a false combination
with קוה. To think of pareo, parui, paritum (Mhlau), was not yet granted
to him.)

follow, is informed by Abulwald, skilled in the Arab., of a better: יקהה
(or יקּהה, cf. נצּרה, [Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003).md) is
the Arab. wakhat, obedience (vid., above יקה under 1a). If now it is
said of such a haughty, insolent eye, that the ravens of the brook (cf.
[Kg1 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#004).md) will pluck it out, and the
בני־נשׁר eat it, they, the eagle's children, the unchildlike human eye:
it is only the description of the fate that is before such an one, to
die a violent death, and to become a prey to the fowls of heaven (cf.
e.g., [Jer 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#003.md)., and Passow's Lex.
under κόραξ); and if this threatening is not always thus literally
fulfilled, yet one has not on that account to render the future
optatively, with Hitzig; this is a false conclusion, from a too literal
interpretation, for the threatening is only to be understood after its
spirit, viz., that a fearful and a dishonourable end will come to such
an one. Instead of יקּרוּה, as Mhlau reads from the Leipzig Cod., יקרוה,
with Mercha (Athias and Nissel have it with Tarcha), is to be read, for
a word between Olewejored and Athnach must always contain a conjunctive
accent (Thorath Emeth, p. 51; Accentuationssystem, xviii. 9). ערבי־נחל
is also irregular, and instead of it ערבי־נחל is to be written, for the
reason given above under [Pro 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#016.md)
(מים).

[Proverbs 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 30:18</span></span>

The following proverb, again a numerical proverb, begins with the eagle,
mentioned in the last line of the foregoing:

18 Three things lie beyond me,

And four I understand not:

19 The way of the eagle in the heavens,

The way of a serpent over a rock,

The way of a ship on the high sea,

And the way of a man with a maid.

20 Thus is the way of the adulterous woman:

She eateth and wipeth her mouth, and saith:

I have done no iniquity.

נפלאוּ ממּנּי, as relative clause, like 15b (where Aquila, Symmachus,
Theodotion rightly: τρία δέ ἐστιν ἃ οὐ πλησθήσεται), is joined to שׁלשׁה
המּה. On the other hand, ארבע (τέσσαρα, for with the Kerı̂, conforming to
18a, ארבּעה, τέσσαρας) has to be interpreted as object. accus. The
introduction of four things that are not known is in expressions like
[Job 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003.md); cf. [Psa
139:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#006.md). The turning-point lies in the
fourth; to that point the other three expressions gravitate, which have
not an object in themselves, but are only as folie to the fourth. The
articles wanting after הנּשׁר: they would be only the marks of the
gender, and are therefore unnecessary; cf. under [Pro
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#002.md). And while בּשּׁמים, in the
heavens, and בלב־ים, in the sea, are the expressions used, עלי צוּר is
used for on the rock, because here "on" is not at the same time "in,"
"within," as the eagle cleaves the air and the ship the waves. For this
same reason the expression, "the way of a man בּעלמה," is not to be
understood of love unsought, suddenly taking possession of and
captivating a man toward this or that maid, so that the principal
thought of the proverb may be compared to the saying, "marriages are
made in heaven;" but, as in Kidduschin 2b, with reference to this
passage, is said coitus via appellatur. The ב refers to copula carnalis.
But in what respect did his understanding not reach to this?
"Wonderful," thus Hitzig explains as the best interpreter of this
opinion elsewhere (cf. Psychol. p. 115) propounded, "appeared to him the
flying, and that how a large and thus heavy bird could raise itself so
high in the air ([Job 39:27](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#027).md); then
how, over the smooth rock, which offers no hold, the serpent pushes
itself along; finally, how the ship in the trackless waves, which
present nothing to the eye as a guide, nevertheless finds its way. These
three things have at the same time this in common, that they leave no
trace of their pathway behind them. But of the fourth way that cannot be
said; for the trace is left on the substrat, which the man דּרך, and it
becomes manifest, possibly as pregnancy, keeping out of view that the
עלמה may yet be בתולה. That which is wonderful is consequently only the
coition itself, its mystical act and its incomprehensible consequences."
But does not this interpretation carry in itself its own refutation? To
the three wonderful ways which leave no traces behind them, there cannot
be compared a fourth, the consequences of which are not only not
trackless, but, on the contrary, become manifest as proceeding from the
act in an incomprehensible way. The point of comparison is either the
wonderfulness of the event or the tracklessness of its consequences. But
now "the way of a man בתולה" is altogether inappropriate to designate
the wonderful event of the origin of a human being. How altogether
differently the Chokma expresses itself on this matter is seen from [Job
10:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008.md); [Ecc
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005) (cf. Psychol. p. 210.md). That "way
of a man with a maid" denotes only the act of coition, which
physiologically differs in nothing from that of the lower animals, and
which in itself, in the externality of its accomplishment, the poet
cannot possibly call something transcendent. And why did he use the word
בעלמה, and not rather בּנקבה \[with a female\] or בּאשּׁה \[id.\]? For
this reason, because he meant the act of coition, not as a physiological
event, but as a historical occurrence, as it takes place particularly in
youth as the goal of love, not always reached in the divinely-appointed
way. The point of comparison hence is not the secret of conception, but
the tracelessness of the carnal intercourse. Now it is also clear why
the way of the serpent עלי צור was in his eye: among grass, and still
more in sand, the trace of the serpent's path would perhaps be visible,
but not on a hard stone, over which it has glided. And it is clear why
it is said of the ship בלב־ים \[in the heart of the sea\]: while the
ship is still in sight from the land, one knows the track it follows;
but who can in the heart of the sea, i.e., on the high sea, say that
here or there a ship has ploughed the water, since the water-furrows
have long ago disappeared? Looking to the heavens, one cannot say that
an eagle has passed there; to the rock, that a serpent has wound its way
over it; to the high sea, that a ship has been steered through it; to
the maid, that a man has had carnal intercourse with her. That the fact
might appear on nearer investigation, although this will not always
guide to a certain conclusion, is not kept in view; only the outward
appearance is spoken of, the intentional concealment (Rashi) being in
this case added thereto. Sins against the sixth \[= seventh\]
commandment remain concealed from human knowledge, and are distinguished
from others by this, that they shun human cognition (as the proverb
says: אין אפיטרופוס לעריות, there is for sins of the flesh no ἐπίτροπος)
- unchastity can mask itself, the marks of chastity are deceitful, here
only the All-seeing Eye (עין ראה כּל, Aboth ii. 1) perceives that which
is done. Yet it is not maintained that "the way of a man with a maid"
refers exclusively to external intercourse; but altogether on this side
the proverb gains ethical significance. Regarding עלמה (from עלם, pubes
esse et caeundi cupidus, not from עלם, to conceal, and not, as Schultens
derives it, from עלם, signare, to seal) as distinguished from בּתוּלה,
vid., under [Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md). The mark of
maidenhood belongs to עלמה not in the same way as to בתולה (cf. [Gen
24:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#043) with 16.md), but only the marks of
puberty and youth; the wife אשּׁה (viz., אושׁת אישׁ) cannot as such be
called עלמה. Ralbag's gloss עלמה שׁהיא בעולה is incorrect, and in
Arama's explanation (Akeda, Abschn. 9): the time is not to be determined
when the sexual love of the husband to his wife flames out, ought to
have been ודרך אישׁ בּאשׁתּו ne. One has therefore to suppose that [Pro
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#020.md) explains what is meant by "the
way of a man with a maid" by a strong example (for "the adulterous
woman" can mean only an old adulteress), there not inclusive, for the
tracklessness of sins of the flesh in their consequences.

This 20th verse does not appear to have been an original part of the
numerical proverb, but is an appendix thereto (Hitzig). If we assume
that כּן points forwards: thus as follows is it with the... (Fleischer),
then we should hold this verse as an independent cognate proverb; but
where is there a proverb (except [Pro
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#019).md) that begins with כּן? כן, which
may mean eodem modo (for one does not say כּן גּם) as well as eo modo,
here points backwards in the former sense. Instead of וּמחתה פּיה (not
פּיה; for the attraction of that which follows, brought about by the
retrogression of the tone of the first word, requires dageshing, Thorath
Emeth, p. 30) the lxx has merely ἀπονιψαμένη, i.e., as Immanuel
explains: מקנּחה עצמה, abstergens semet ipsam, with Grotius, who to
tergens os suum adds the remark: σεμνολογία (honesta elocutio). But
eating is just a figure, like the "secret bread," [Pro
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#017.md), and the wiping of the mouth
belongs to this figure. This appendix, with its כן, confirms it, that
the intention of the four ways refers to the tracklessness of the
consequences.

[Proverbs 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 30:21</span></span>

It is now not at all necessary to rack one's brains over the grounds or
the reasons of the arrangement of the following proverb (vid., Hitzig).
There are, up to this point, two numerical proverbs which begin with
שׁתּים, [Pro 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007.md), and שׁתּי, [Pro
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md); after the cipher 2 there then,
[Pro 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018.md), followed the cipher 3,
which is now here continued:

21 Under three things doth the earth tremble,

And under four can it not stand:

22 Under a servant when he becomes king,

And a profligate when he has bread enough;

23 Under an unloved woman when she is married,

And a maid-servant when she becomes heiress to her mistress.

We cannot say here that the 4 falls into 3 + 1; but the four consists of
four ones standing beside one another. ארץ is here without pausal
change, although the Athnach here, as at [Pro
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024.md), where the modification of sound
occurs, divides the verse into two; מארץ, 14b (cf. [Psa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002).md), remains, on the other hand,
correctly unchanged. The "earth" stands here, as frequently, instead of
the inhabitants of the earth. It trembles when one of the four persons
named above comes and gains free space for acting; it feels itself
oppressed as by an insufferable burden (an expression similar to [Amo
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010).md); - the arrangement of society is
shattered; an oppressive closeness of the air, as it were, settles over
all minds. The first case is already designated, [Pro
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#010.md), as improper: under a slave,
when he comes to reign (quum rex fit); for suppose that such an one has
reached the place of government, not by the murder of the king and by
the robbery of the crown, but, as is possible in an elective monarchy,
by means of the dominant party of the people, he will, as a rule, seek
to indemnify himself in his present highness for his former lowliness,
and in the measure of his rule show himself unable to rise above his
servile habits, and to pass out of the limited circle of his earlier
state. The second case is this: a נבל, one whose mind is perverted and
whose conduct is profligate - in short, a low man (vid., [Pro
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017).md) - ישׂבּע־לחם (cf.
Metheg-Setzung, 28), i.e., has enough to eat (cf. to the expression [Pro
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#019.md); [Jer
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017).md); for this undeserved living
without care and without want makes him only so much the more arrogant,
and troublesome, and dangerous. The שׂנוּאה, in the second case, is not
thought of as a spouse, and that, as in supposed polygamy, [Gen
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#031.md); [Deu
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015.md), as fallen into disfavour,
but who again comes to favour and honour (Dathe, Rosenmller); for she
can be שׂנואה without her own fault, and as such she is yet no גּרוּשׁה;
and it is not to be perceived why the re-assumption of such an one
should shatter social order. Rightly Hitzig, and, after his example,
Zckler: an unmarried lady, an old spinster, is meant, whom no one
desired because she had nothing attractive, and was only repulsive (cf.
Grimm, under Sir. 7:26b). If such an one, as כּי תבעל says, at length,
however, finds her husband and enters into the married relation, then
she carries her head so much the higher; for she gives vent to
ill-humour, strengthened by long restraint, against her subordinates;
then she richly requites her earlier and happily married companions for
their depreciation of her, among whom she had to suffer, as able to find
no one who would love her. In the last case it is asked whether
כּי־תירשׁ is meant of inheriting as an heiress (Aquila, Symmachus,
Theodotion, the Targ., Jerome, the Venet., and Luther), or supplanting
(Euchel, Gesenius, Hitzig), i.e., an entering into the inheritance of
the dead, or an entering into the place of a living mistress. Since
ירשׁ, with the accus. of the person, [Gen
15:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#003.md), signifies to be the heir of
one, and only with the accus. of peoples and lands signifies, "to take
into possession (to seize) by supplanting," the former is to be
preferred; the lxx (Syr.), ὅταν ἐκβάλῃ, appear to have read כּי־תגרשׁ.
This גּרשׁ would certainly be, after [Gen
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md), a piece of the world turned
upside down; but also the entering, as heiress, into the inheritance,
makes the maid-servant the reverse of that which she was before, and
brings with it the danger that the heiress, notwithstanding her want of
culture and dignity, demean herself also as heiress of the rank.
Although the old Israelitish law knew only intestate succession to an
inheritance, yet there also the case might arise, that where there were
no natural or legal heirs, the bequest of a wife of rank passed over to
her servants and nurses.

[Proverbs 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 30:24</span></span>

Another proverb with the cipher 4, its first line terminating in ארץ:

24 Four are the little things of the earth,

And yet they are quick of wit - wise:

25 The ants - a people not strong,

And yet they prepare in summer their food;

26 Conies - a people not mighty,

And yet set their dwelling on the rocks;

27 No king have the locusts,

And yet they go forth in rank and file, all of them together;

28 The lizard thou canst catch with the hands,

And yet it is in the king's palaces.

By the disjunctive accent, ארבּעה, in spite of the following word toned
on the beginning, retains its ultima-toning, 18a; but here, by the
conjunctive accent, the tone retrogrades to the penult., which does not
elsewhere occur with this word. The connection קטנּי־ארץ is not
superlat. (for it is impossible that the author could reckon the שׁפנים,
conies, among the smallest of beasts), but, as in the expression
נכבּדּי־ארץ, the honoured of the earth, [Isa
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md). In 24b, the lxx, Syr., Jerome,
and Luther see in מ the comparative: σοφώτερα τῶν σοφῶν (מחכמים), but in
this connection of words it could only be partitive (wise, reckoning
among the wise); the part. Pual מחכּמים (Theodotion, the Venet.
σεσοφισμένα) was in use after [Psa
88:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#006.md), and signified, like בּשׁל
מבשּׁל, [Exo 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#009.md), boiled well; thus
חכמים מחכמים, taught wit, wise, cunning, prudent (cf. [Psa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007.md), a planned plan = a cunningly
wrought out plan; [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md), and
Vitringa thereto: grounded = firm, grounding), Ewald, 313c. The
reckoning moves in the contrasts of littleness to power, and of
greatness to prudence. The unfolding of the ארבעה \[four\] begins with
the הנּמלים \[the ants\] and שׁפנּים \[conies\], subject conceptions
with apposit. joined; 26a, at least in the indetermination of the
subject, cannot be a declaration. Regarding the fut. consec. as the
expression, not of a causal, but of a contrasted connection, vid.,
Ewald, 342, 1a. The ants are called עם, and they deserve this name, for
they truly form communities with well-ordered economy; but, besides, the
ancients took delight in speaking of the various classes of animals as
peoples and states.

(Note: Vid., Walter von der Vogelweide, edited by Lachmann, p. 8f.)

That which is said, 25b, as also [Pro
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#008.md), is not to be understood of stores
laid up for the winter. For the ants are torpid for the most part in
winter; but certainly the summer is their time for labour, when the
labourers gather together food, and feed in a truly motherly way the
helpless. שׁפן, translated arbitrarily in the Venet. by ἐχῖνοι, in the
lxx by χοιρογρύλλιοι, by the Syr. and Targ. here and at Ps 104 by חגס,
and by Jerome by lepusculus (cf. λαγίδιον), both of which names, here to
be understood after a prevailing Jewish opinion, denote the Caninichen

(Note: The kaninchen as well as the klippdachs \[cliff-badgers\] may be
meant, [Lev 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#005.md) ([Deu
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#007).md); neither of these belong to the
bisulca, nor yet, it is true, to the ruminants, though to the ancients
(as was the case also with hares) they seemed to do. The klippdach is
still, in Egypt and Syria, regarded as unclean.)

(Luther), Latin cuniculus (κόνικλος), is not the kaninchen \[rabbit\],
nor the marmot, χοιρογρύλλιος (C. B. Michaelis, Ziegler, and others);
this is called in Arab. yarbuw'; but שׁפן is the wabr, which in South
Arab. is called thufun, or rather thafan, viz., the klippdachs (hyrax
syriacus), like the marmot, which lives in societies and dwells in the
clefts of the mountains, e.g., at the Kedron, the Dead Sea, and at Sinai
(vid., Knobel on [Lev 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#005.md); cf.
Brehm's Thierleben, ii. p. 721ff., the Illustrirte Zeitung, 1868, Nr.
1290). The klippdachs are a weak little people, and yet with their
weakness they unite the wisdom that they establish themselves among the
rocks. The ants show their wisdom in the organization of labour, here in
the arranging of inaccessible dwellings.

[Pro 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#027.md)

Thirdly, the locusts belong to the class of the wise little folk: these
have no king, but notwithstanding that, there is not wanting to them
guidance; by the power and foresight of one sovereign will they march
out as a body, חצץ, dividing, viz., themselves, not the booty
(Schultens); thus: dividing themselves into companies, ordine
dispositae, from חצץ, to divide, to fall into two (cogn. חצה, e.g., [Gen
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#007).md) or more parts; Mhlau, p. 59-64,
has thoroughly investigated this whole wide range of roots. What this
חצץ denotes is described in [Joe 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#007.md) :
"Like mighty men they hunt; like men of war they climb the walls; they
march forward every one on his appointed way, and change not their
paths." Jerome narrates from his own observation: tanto ordine ex
dispositione jubentis (lxx at this passage before us: ἀφ ̓ ἑνὸς
κελεύσματος εὐτάκτως) volitant, ut instar tesserularum, quae in
pavimentis artificis figuntur manu, suum locum teneant et ne puncto
quidem et ut ita dicam ungue transverso declinent ad alterum. Aben Ezra
and others find in חצץ the idea of gathering together in a body, and in
troops, according to which also the Syr., Targ., Jerome, and Luther
translate; Kimchi and Meri gloss חצץ by חותך and כורת, and understand it
of the cutting off, i.e., the eating up, of plants and trees, which the
Venet. renders by ἐκτέμνουσα.

[Pro 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#028.md)

In this verse the expression wavers in a way that is with difficulty
determinable between שׂממית and שׁממית. The Edd. of Opitz Jablonski and
Van der Hooght have 'שׂם, but the most, from the Venetian 1521 to
Nissel, have 'שׁם (vid., Mhlau, p. 69). The Codd. also differ as to the
reading of the word; thus the Codd. Erfurt 2 and 3 have 'שׂם, but Cod.
1294 has 'שׁם. Isaak Tschelebi and Moses Algazi, in their writings
regarding words with שׁ and שׂ (Constant. 1723 and 1799), prefer 'שׂם,
and so also do Mordecai Nathan in his Concordance (1563-4), David de
Pomis (1587), and Norzi. An important evidence is the writing סממית,
Schabbath 77b, but it is as little decisive as סריון \[coat of mail\],
used by [Jer 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#004.md), is decisive against
the older expression שׁריון. But what kind of a beast is meant here is a
question. The swallow is at once to be set aside, as the Venet.
translates (χελιδών) after Kimchi, who explains after Abulwald, but not
without including himself, that the Heb. word for (Arab.) khuttaf (which
is still the name given to the swallow from its quickness of motion),
according to Haja's testimony, is much rather סנוּנית, a name for the
swallow; which also the Arab. (Freytag, ii. p. 368) and the modern
Syriac confirm; besides, in old Heb. it has the name of סוּס or סיס
(from Arab. shash, to fly confusedly hither and thither). In like manner
the ape (Aben Ezra, Meri, Immanuel) is to be set aside, for this is
called קוף (Indian kapi, kap, kamp, to move inconstantly and quickly up
and down),

(Note: Vid., A Weber's Indische Studien, i. pp. 217, 343.)

and appears here admissible only on the ground that from בידים תתפשׂ
they read that the beast had a resemblance to man. There remains now
only the lizard (lxx, Jerome) and the spider (Luther) to be considered.
The Talmud, Schabbath 77b, reckons five instances in which fear of the
weaker pursues the stronger: one of these instances is אימת סנוניתעל
הנשׁר, another אימת סממית על העקרב. The swallow, thus Rashi explains,
creeps under the wings of the eagle and hinders it from spreading them
out in its flight; and the spider (araigne) creeps into the ear of the
scorpion; or also: a bruised spider applied heals the scorpion's sting.
A second time the word occurs, Sanhedrin 103b, where it is said of King
Amon that he burnt the Tôra, and that over the altar came a שממית (here
with ש), which Rashi explains of the spider (a spider's web). But Aruch
testifies that in these two places of the Talmud the explanation is
divided between ragnatelo (spider) and (Ital.) lucrta (lizard). For the
latter, he refers to [Lev 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#030.md), where
לטאה (also explained by Rashi by lzard) in the Jerus. Targ. is rendered

(Note: The Samaritan has, [Lev 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#030.md),
שממית for אנקה, and the Syr. translates the latter word by אמקתא, which
is used in the passage before us (cf. Geiger's Urschrift, p. 68f.) for
שממית; omakto (Targ. akmetha) appears there to mean, not a spider, but a
lizard.)

by שממיתא (the writing here also varies between שׁ and שׂ or ס).
Accordingly, and after the lxx and Jerome, it may be regarded as a
confirmed tradition that שממית means not the spider, for which the name
עכּבישׁ is coined, but the lizard, and particularly the stellion
(spotted lizard). Thus the later language used it as a word still living
(plur. סממיּות, Sifre, under [Deu
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019).md). The Arab. also confirms this
name as applicable to the lizard.

(Note: Perhaps also the modern Greek, σαμιάμινθος (σαμιάμιδος,
σαμιαμίδιον), which Grotius compares.)

"To this day in Syria and in the Desert it is called samawiyyat,
probably not from poison, but from samawah = שׁממה, the wilderness,
because the beast is found only in the stony heaps of the Kharab" (Mhlau
after Wetzstein). If this derivation is correct, then שׁממית is to be
regarded as an original Heb. expression; but the lizard's name, samm,
which, without doubt, designates the animal as poisonous (cf. סם, samam,
samm, vapour, poisonous breath, poison), favours Schultens' view: שממית
= (Arab.) samamyyat, afflatu interficiens, or generally venenosa. In the
expression בּידים תּתפּשׂ, Schultens, Gesenius, Ewald, Hitzig, Geier,
and others, understand ידים of the two fore-feet of the lizard: "the
lizard feels (or: seizes) with its two hands;" but granting that ידים is
used of the fifteen feet of the stellio, or of the climbing feet of any
other animal (lxx καλαβώτης = ἀσκαλαβώτης), yet it is opposed by this
explanation, that in line first of this fourth distich an expression
regarding the smallness of the weakness of the beast is to be expected,
as at 25a, 26a, and 27a. And since, besides, תפשׂ with ביד or בכף always
means "to catch" or "seize" ([Eze
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#016.md); [Eze
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#007.md); [Jer
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#023).md), so the sense according to that
explanation is: the lizard thou canst catch with the hand, and yet it is
in kings' palaces, i.e., it is a little beast, which one can grasp with
his hand, and yet it knows how to gain an entrance into palaces, by
which in its nimbleness and cunning this is to be thought of, that it
can scale the walls even to the summit (Aristoph. Nubes 170). To read
תּתּפשׂ with Mhlau, after Bttcher, recommends itself by this, that in
תּהפּשׂ one misses the suff. pointing back (תּתפּשׂנּה); also why the
intensive of תפשׂ is used, is not rightly comprehended. Besides, the
address makes the expression more animated; cf. [Isa
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#025.md), תבוא. In the lxx as it lies
before us, the two explanations spoken of are mingled together: καὶ
καλαβώτης (= ἀσκαλαβώτης) χερσὶν ἐπειδόμενος καὶ εὐάλωτος ὢν... This
εὐάλωτος ὢν (Symmachus, χερσὶν ἐλλαμβανόμενος) hits the sense of 28a. In
היכלי מלך, מלך is not the genit. of possession, as at [Psa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009), but of description (Hitzig.md), as
at [Amo 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#013.md).

[Proverbs 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 30:29</span></span>

Another numerical proverb with the cipher 4 = 3 + 1:

29 Three things are of stately walk,

And four of stately going:

30 The lion, the hero among beasts,

And that turneth back before nothing;

31 The swift-loined, also the goat;

And a king with whom is the calling out of the host.

Regarding היטיב with inf. following (the segolated n. actionis צעד is of
equal force with an inf.), vid., under [Pro
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002.md).

(Note: In 29a, after Norzi, מיטיבי, and in 29b, מיטבי, is to be written,
and this is required by the little Masora to [Sa1
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#031.md), the great, to [Eze
33:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#033.md), and also the Erfurt little
Masora to the passage before us.)

The relation of the members of the sentence in 30a is like that in 25a
and 26a: subj. and apposit., which there, as here, is continued in a
verbal clause which appears to us as relative. It deserves to be here
remarked that לישׁ, as the name for a lion, occurs only here and at [Job
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#011.md), and in the description of the
Sinai wilderness, [Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md); in Arab.
it is layth, Aram. לית, and belongs to the Arameo-Arab. dialect of this
language; the lxx and Syr. translate it "the young lion;" the Venet.
excellently, by the epic λῖς. בּבּהמה has the article only to denote the
genus, viz., of the beasts, and particularly the four-footed beasts.
What is said in 30b (cf. with the expression, [Job
39:22](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#022).md) is described in [Isa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004.md). The two other beasts which
distinguish themselves by their stately going are in 31a only briefly
named. But we are not in the condition of the readers of this Book of
Proverbs, who needed only to hear the designation זרזיר מתנים at once to
know what beast was meant. Certainly זרזיר, as the name for a beast, is
not altogether unknown in the post-bibl. Heb. "In the days of Rabbi
Chija (the great teacher who came from Babylon to the Academy of
Sepphoris), as is narrated in Bereschith rabba, sect. 65, a zarzir flew
to the land of Israel, and it was brought to him with the question
whether it were eatable. Go, said he, place it on the roof! Then came an
Egyptian raven and lighted down beside it. See, said Chija, it is
unclean, for it belongs to the genus of the ravens, which is unclean
([Lev 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#015).md). From this circumstance
there arose the proverb: The raven goes to the zarzir because it belongs
to his own tribe."

(Note: This "like draws to like" in the form: "not in vain goes the
raven to the zarzir, it belongs just to its own tribe," came to be often
employed, Chullin 65a, Baba Kamma 92b. Plantavitius has it, Tendlau more
at large, Sprichwrter, u.s.w., Nr. 577.)

Also the Jer. Rosch ha-schane, Halacha 3: "It is the manner of the world
that one seeks to assist his zarzir, and another his zarzir, to obtain
the victory;" and Midrash Echa v. 1, according to which it is the custom
of the world, that one who has a large and a little zarzir in his house,
is wont to treat the little one sparingly, so that in the case of the
large one being killed, he might not need to buy another. According to
this, the zarzir is a pugnacious animal, which also the proverb
Bereschith rabba, c. 75, confirms: two zarzir do not sleep on one board;
and one makes use of his for contests like cock-fights. According to
this, the זרזיר is a bird, and that of the species of the raven; after
Rashi, the tourneau, the starling, which is confirmed by the Arab.
zurzur (vulgar Arab. zarzur), the common name of starlings (cf. Syr.
zarzizo, under zrz of Castelli). But for the passage before us, we
cannot regard this as important, for why is the starling fully named
זרזיר מתנים? To this question Kimchi has already remarked that he knows
no answer for it. Only, perhaps, the grave magpie (corvus pica),
strutting with upraised tail, might be called succinctus lumbos, if
מתנים can at all be used here of a bird. At the earliest, this might
possibly be used of a cock, which the later Heb. named directly גּבר,
because of its manly demeanour; most old translators so understand it.
The lxx translates, omitting the loins, by ἀλέκτωρ ἐμπεριπατῶν θηλείαις
εὔψυχος, according to which the Syr. and Targ.: like the cock which
struts about proudly among the hens;

(Note: Regarding the Targum Text, vid., Levy under אבּכא and זרכּל. The
expression דּמזדּרז (who is girded, and shows himself as such) is not
unsuitable.)

Aquila and Theodotion: ἀλέκτωρ (ἀλεκτρυὼν) νώτου; The Quinta: ἀλέκτωρ
ὀσφύος; Jezome: gallus succinctus lumbos. Ṣarṣar (not ṣirṣir, as Hitzig
vocalizes) is in Arab. a name for a cock, from ṣarṣara, to crow, an
onomatopoeia. But the Heb. זרזיר, as the name of a bird, signifies, as
the Talmud proves on the ground of that history, not a cock, but a bird
of the raven order, whether a starling, a crow, or a magpie. And if this
name of a corvinus is formed from the onomatopoeia זרזר, the weaker form
of that (Arab.) ṣarṣar, then מתנים, which, for זרזיר, requires the
verbal root זרז, to girdle, is not wholly appropriate; and how strangely
would the three animals be mingled together, if between לישׁ and תישׁ,
the two four-footed animals, a bird were placed! If, as is to be
expected, the "Lendenumgrtete" \[the one girded about the loins = זרזיר
מתנים\] be a four-footed animal, then it lies near, with C. B. Michaelis
and Ziegler, after Ludolf's

(Note: Ludolf gave, in his Hist. Aethiop. i. 10, and Commentarius, p.
150, only a description of the Zecora, without combining therewith
זרזיר; but vid., Joh. Dietr. Winckler's Theol. u. Philol. Abhand. i.
(1755) p. 33ff.: "A nearer explanation of what is to be understood by
זרזיר מתנים, [Pro 30:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#031.md), along with a
statement from a hitherto unpublished correspondence between the learned
philologists Hiob Ludolf and Matthai Leydecker, a Reformed preacher in
Batavia." With Ludolf, Joh. Simonis also, in the Arcanum Formarum
(1735), p. 687f., decides in favour of the zebra.)

example, to think of the zebra, the South African wild ass. But this
animal lay beyond the sphere of the author's observation, and perhaps
also of his knowledge, and at the same time of that of the Israelitish
readers of this Book of Proverbs; and the dark-brown cross stripes on a
white ground, by which the zebra is distinguished, extend not merely to
its limbs, but over the whole body, and particularly over the front of
the body. It would be more tenable to think of the leopard, with its
black round spots, or the tiger, with dark stripes; but the name זרזיר
מתנים scarcely refers to the colour of the hair, since one has to
understand it after the Aram. זרז חרציהּ = שׁנּס מתניו, [Kg1
18:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#046.md), or אחר חלציו, [Job
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003.md), and thus of an activity, i.e.,
strength and swiftness, depending on the condition of the loins. Those
who, with Kimchi, think that the נמר \[leopard\] is thus named, ground
their view, not on this, that it has rings or stripes round its legs,
but on this, that it דק מתנים וחזק במתניו. But this beast has certainly
its definite name; but a fundamental supposition entering into every
attempt at an explanation is this, that זרזיר מתנים, as well as לישׁ and
תישׁ, is the proper name of a beast, not a descriptive attribute.
Therefore the opinion of Rosse, which Bochart has skilfully established
in the Hierozoicon, does not recommend itself, for he only suggests, for
choice, to understand the name, "the girded about the loins," in the
proper sense of straps and clasps around and on the loins (thus e.g.,
Gesenius, Fleischer, Hitzig), or of strength, in the sense of the Arab.
habuwk, the firmly-bound = compact, or ṣamm alṣlab, the girded loin
(thus e.g., Muntinghe). Schultens connects together both references:
Utrumque jungas licet. That the by-name fits the horse, particularly the
war-horse, is undeniable; one would have to refer it, with Mhlau, to the
slender structure, the thin flanks, which are reckoned among the
requisites of a beautiful horse.

(Note: Vid., Ahlwardt, Chalef elahmar's Qasside (1859), and the
interpretation of the description of the horse contained therein, p.
210ff.)

But if succinctus lumbos were a by-name of a horse, why did not the
author at once say סוס זרזיר מתנים? We shall give the preference to the
opinion, according to which the expression, "girt about the loins" =
"with strong loins," or "with slender limbs," is not the by-name, but
the proper name of the animal. This may be said of the hunting-hound,
lvrier (according to which the Venet., incorrectly translating מתנים:
λαγῳοκύων ψοιῶν),

(Note: Thus reads Schleusner, Opusc. Crit. p. 318, and refers it to the
horse: nam solebant equos figuris quibusdam notare et quasi sigillare.)

which Kimchi ranks in the first place. Luther, by his translation, Ein
Wind = Windhund \[greyhound\], of good limbs, has given the right
direction to this opinion. Melanchton, Lavater, Mercier, Geier, and
others, follow him; and, among the moderns, so also do Ewald and Bttcher
(also Bertheau and Stuart), which latter supposes that before זרזיר
מתנים there originally stood כבל, which afterwards disappeared. But why
should the greyhound not at once be called זרזיר מתנים? We call the
smaller variety of this dog the Windspiel \[greyhound\]; and by this
name we think on a hound, without saying Windspielhund. The name זרזיר
מתנים (Symmachus excellently: περιεσφιγμένος, not περιεσφραγισμένος, τὴν
ὀσφύν, i.e., strongly bound in the limbs) is fitted at once to suggest
to us this almost restless, slender animal, with its high, thin, nimble
limbs. The verbal stem זרר (Arab.) zarr, signifies to press together, to
knit together; the reduplicative form זרזר, to bind firmly together,
whence זרזיר, firmly bound together, referred to the limbs as
designating a natural property (Ewald, 158a): of straight and
easily-moveable legs.

(Note: The Aram. זרז is shortened from זרזר, as כּרך from כּרכּר; the
particip. adj. זריז signifies nimble, swift, eager, e.g., Pesachim 4a:
"the zealous obey the commandment - as soon as possible hasten to fulfil
it.")

The hunting-hound (salki or salki, i.e., coming from Seleucia) is
celebrated by the Arab. poets as much as the hunting-horse.

(Note: Vid., Ahlwardt, Chalef elahmar's Qasside, p. 205f.)

The name כּלב, though not superfluous, the author ought certainly to
have avoided, because it does not sound well in the Heb. collocation of
words.

There now follows תישׁ, a goat, and that not the ram (Jerome, Luther),
which is called איל, but the he-goat, which bears this name, as
Schultens has already recognised, from its pushing, as it is also called
עתּוּד, as paratus ad pugnam; the two names appear to be only
provincially different; שׂעיר, on the contrary, is the old he-goat, as
shaggy; and צפיר also perhaps denotes it, as Schultens supposes, with
twisted, i.e., curled hair (tortipilus). In Arab. tays denotes the
he-goat as well as the roebuck and the gazelle, and that at full growth.
The lxx (the Syr. and Targ., which is to be emended after the Syr.) is
certainly right, for it understands the leading goat: καὶ τράγος
ἡγούμενος αἰπολίου. The text, however, has not ותישׁ, but או תישׁ, ἢ
τράγος (Aquila, Theodotion, Quinta, and the Venet.). Bttcher is
astonished that Hitzig did not take hold of this או, and conjectures
תּאו־תישׁ, which should mean a "gazelle-goat" (Mhlau: dorcas mas). But
it is too bold to introduce here תּאו (תּוא), which is only twice named
in the O.T., and תאו־תישׁ for תּאו זכר is not the Heb. style; and
besides, the setting aside of או has a harsh asyndeton for its
consequence, which bears evidence to the appearance that תאו and תישׁ
are two different animals. And is the או then so objectionable? More
wonderful still must [Sol 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md) appear
to us. If the author enumerated the four of stately going on his
fingers, he would certainly have said ותישׁ. By או he communicates to
the hearer, setting before him another figure, how there in the Song
Sulamith's fancy passed from one object to another.

To the lion, the king of the animal world, the king אלקוּם עמּו
corresponds. This אלקום Hitzig regards as mutilated from אלהים (which
was both written and pronounced as אלקום by the Jews, so as to conceal
the true sound of the name of God) - which is untenable, for this
reason, that this religious conclusion \["A king with whom God is"\]
accords badly with the secular character of this proverb. Geiger
(Urschrift, p. 62ff.) translates: "and King Alkimos corresponding to it
(the lustful and daring goat)" - he makes the harmless proverb into a
ludibrium from the time of the Maccabeo-Syrian war. The lxx, which the
Syr. and Targ. follow, translates καὶ βασιλεὺς δημηγορῶν ἐν ἔθνει; it
appears to have changed אלקום עמו into קם אל עמו (standing with his
people and haranguing them), like the Quinta: καὶ βας. ἀναστὰς (ὃς
ἀνέστη) ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ. Ziegler and Bttcher also, reading עמּו and אל
without any transposition, get ומלך אל־קוּם עמּו t, which the former
translates: "a king with the presence of his people;" the latter, "a
king with the setting up of his people," - not accordant with the
thought, for the king should be brought forward as מיטיב לכת. For the
same reason, Kimchi's explanation is not suitable: a king with whom is
no resistance, i.e., against whom no one can rank himself (thus e.g.,
also Immanuel); or more specially, but not better: who has no successor
of his race (according to which the Venet. ἀδιάδεκτος ξὺν ἑαυτῷ). Rather
this explanation commends itself: a king with whom (i.e., in war with
whom) is no resistance. Thus Jerome and Luther: against whom no one dare
place himself; thus Rashi, Aben Ezra, Ralbag (שׁאין תקומה עמו), Ahron b.
Josef (קום = ἀντίστασις), Arama, and others; thus also Schultens,
Fleischer (adversus quem nemo consistere audet), Ewald, Bertheau,
Elster, Stuart, and others. But this connection of אל with the infin. is
not Heb.; and if the Chokma, xii. 28, has coined the expression אל־מות
for the idea of "immortality," then certainly it does not express the
idea of resistlessness by so bold a quasi compositum. But this boldness
is also there mitigated, for יהי is supplied after אל, which is not here
practicable with קוּם, which is not a subst. like מות. Pocock in the
Spec. historiae Arabum, and Castellus in the Lex. Heptaglotton (not
Castellio, as the word is printed by Zckler), have recognised in אלקום
the Arab. âlkawm; Schultens gives the lxx the honour of this
recognition, for he regards their translation as a paraphrase of ὁ δῆμος
μετ ̓ αὐτοῦ. Bertheau thinks that it ought to be in Arab. kawmuhu, but
אלקום עמו = âlkawhu ma'ahu is perfectly correct, âlkawhu is the summons
or the Heerbann = arriere-ban;

(Note: Wetzstein's Ausgewhlte Inschriften, p. 355: "The word ḳawm
signifies people, not in the sense of populus, but in the sense of the
Heb. קים ([Job 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#007).md) = muḳawim
abrajul, he who breaks with or against any one." Incorrect in
Gesenius-Dietrich's Heb. Wrterbuch.)

in North Africa they speak in their language in the same sense of the
Gums. This explanation of אלקום, from the Arab. Dachselt (rex cum
satellitio suo), Diedrichs in his Arab.-Syr. Spicilegium (1777),
Umbreit, Gesenius, and Vaihinger, have recognised, and Mhlau has anew
confirmed it at length. Hitzig, on the contrary, remarks that if Agur
wrote on Arab. territory, we could be contented with the Arab.
appellative, but not with the article, which in words like אלגּבישׁ and
אלמגּים is no longer of force as an art., but is an integ. component
part of the word. We think that it is with אלקום exactly as with other
words descriptive of lordship, and the many similar that have passed
over into the Spanish language; the word is taken over along with the
article, without requiring the Heb. listener to take the art. as such,
although he certainly felt it better than we do, when we say "das
Alkoran" \[the Alcoran\], "das Alcohol," and the like. Blau also, in his
Gesch. der Arab. Substantiv-Determ.,

(Note: In the "Alt-arab. Sprachstudien," Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr.
xxv. 539f.)

regards it as certain that Agur borrowed this אלקום from the idiom of
the Arabians, among whom he lived, and heard it constantly spoken. By
this explanation we first reach a correspondence between what is
announced in lines first and second and line sixth. A king as such is
certainly not "comely in going;" he can sit upon his throne, and
especially as δημηγορῶν will he sit ([Act
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#021).md) and not stand. But the majesty
of his going shows itself when he marches at the head of those who have
risen up at his summons to war. Then he is for the army what the תישׁ
he-goat is for the flock. The או, preferred to ו, draws close together
the רישׁ e and the king (cf. e.g., [Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009).md).

[Proverbs 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 30:32</span></span>

Another proverb, the last of Agur's "Words" which exhorts to thoughtful,
discreet demeanour, here follows the proverb of self-conscious, grave
deportment:

32 If thou art foolish in that thou exaltest thyself,

Or in devising, - put thy hand to thy mouth!

33 For the pressure on milk bringeth forth butter,

And pressure on the nose bringeth forth blood,

And pressure on sensibility bringeth forth altercation.

Lwenstein translates [Pro 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032.md) :

Art thou despicable, it is by boasting;

Art thou prudent, then hold thy hand on thy mouth.

But if זמם denotes reflection and deliberation, then נבל, as its
opposite, denotes unreflecting, foolish conduct. Then בּהתנשּׂא ne by
boasting is not to be regarded as a consequent (thus it happens by
lifting thyself up; or: it is connected with boasting); by this
construction also, אם־נבלתּ must be accented with Dechi, not with
Tarcha. Otherwise Euchel:

Hast thou become offensive through pride,

Or seems it so to thee, - lay thy hand to thy mouth.

The thought is appropriate,

(Note: Yet the Talmud, Nidda 27a, derives another moral rule from this
proverb, for it interprets זמם in the sense of זמם = חסם, to tie up, to
bridle, to shut up, but אם נבלת in the sense of "if thou hast made
thyself despicable," as Lwenstein has done.)

but נבלתּ for נבּלתּ is more than improbable; נבל, thus absolutely taken
in an ethical connection, is certainly related to נבל, as כּסל, [Jer
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008.md), to כּסיל. The prevailing mode of
explanation is adopted by Fleischer: si stulta arrogantia elatus fueris
et si quid durius (in alios) mente conceperis, manum ori impone; i.e.,
if thou arrogantly, and with offensive words, wilt strive with others,
then keep thyself back, and say not what thou hast in thy mind. But
while מזמּה and מזמּות denote intrigues, [Pro
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#017.md), as well as plans and
considerations, זמם has never by itself alone the sense of meditari
mala; at [Psa 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012.md), also with ל of
the object at which the evil devices aim. Then for ואם ... אם (Arab. ân
... wân) there is the supposition of a correlative relation, as e.g.,
[Kg1 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#018.md); [Ecc
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md), by which at the same time זמּות
is obviously thought of as a contrast to נבלתּ. This contrast excludes

(Note: The Arab. signification, to become proud, is a nance of the
primary signification, to hold erect - viz. the head - as when the rider
draws up the head of a camel by means of the halter (Arab. zamam).)

for זמות not only the sense of mala moliri (thus e.g., also Mhlau), but
also the sense of the Arab. zamm, superbire (Schultens). Hitzig has the
right determination of the relation of the members of the sentence and
the ideas: if thou art irrational in ebullition of temper and in thought
- thy hand to thy mouth! But התנשּׂא has neither here nor elsewhere the
meaning of התעבּר (to be out of oneself with anger); it signifies
everywhere to elevate or exalt oneself, i.e., rightly or wrongly to make
much of oneself. There are cases where a man, who raises himself above
others, appears as a fool, and indeed acts foolishly; but there are also
other cases, when the despised has a reason and an object for
vindicating his superiority, his repute, his just claim: when, as we
say, he places himself in his right position, and assumes importance;
the poet here recommends, to the one as well as to the other, silence.
The rule that silence is gold has its exceptions, but here also it is
held valid as a rule. Luther and others interpret the perfecta as
looking back: "hast thou become a fool and ascended too high and
intended evil, then lay thy hand on thy mouth." But the reason in [Pro
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#033.md) does not accord with this
rendering, for when that has been done, the occasion for hatred is
already given; but the proverb designs to warn against the stirring up
of hatred by the reclaiming of personal pretensions. The perfecta,
therefore, are to be interpreted as at [Deu
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029.md); [Job
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#015.md), as the expression of the
abstract present; or better, as at [Job
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#016.md), as the expression of the fut.
exactum: if thou wouldest have acted foolishly, since thou walkest
proudly, or if thou hadst (before) thought of it (Aquila, Theodotion:
καὶ ἐὰν ἐννοηθῇς) - the hand on thy mouth, i.e., let it alone, be silent
rather (expression as [Pro 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024.md); [Jdg
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#019.md); [Job
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004).md). The Venet. best: εἴπερ ἐμώρανας
ἐν τῷ ἐπαίρεσθαι καὶ εἴπερ ἐλογίσω, χεὶρ τῷ στόματι. When we have now
interpreted התנשׂא, not of the rising up of anger, we do not also, with
Hitzig, interpret the dual of the two snorting noses - viz. of the
double anger, that of him who provokes to anger, and that of him who is
made angry - but אפּים denotes the two nostrils of one and the same
person, and, figuratively, snorting or anger. Pressure against the nose
is designated ומיץ־אף, ἐκμύζησις (ἐκπίεσις) μυκτῆρος (write ומיץ־אף,
with Metheg, with the long tone, after Metheg-Setzung, 11, 9, 12), and
מיץ אפּים, ἐκμύζησις θυμοῦ (Theodotion), with reference to the proper
meaning of אפים, pressure to anger, i.e., to the stirring up and
strengthening of anger. The nose of him who raises himself up comes into
view, in so far as, with such self-estimation, sneering, snuffling scorn
(μυκτηρίζειν) easily connects itself; but this view of מתנשׂא is not
here spoken of.
