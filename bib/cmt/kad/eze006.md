### [Ezekiel Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 6:0</span></span>

The Judgment upon the Idolatrous Places, and on the Idol-Worshippers

To God's address in [Eze 5:5-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#005.md),
explaining the signs in [Eze 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md),
are appended in [Eze 6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md) and 7 two
additional oracles, which present a further development of the contents
of these signs, the judgment portrayed by them in its extent and
greatness. In [Eze 6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md) there is
announced, in the first section, to the idolatrous places, and on their
account to the land, desolation, and to the idolaters, destruction ([Eze
6:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003).md); and to this is added the
prospect of a remnant of the people, who are dispersed among the
heathen, coming to be converted to the Lord ([Eze
6:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008).md). In the second section the
necessity and terrible character of the impending judgment is repeatedly
described at length as an appendix to [Eze
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#012.md), [Eze
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014.md) ([Eze
6:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011).md).

[Ezekiel 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 6:1</span></span>

The Desolation of the Land, and Destruction of the Idolaters

[Eze 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md). And the word of the Lord
came to me, saying: [Eze 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#002.md). Son of
man, turn thy face towards the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against
them. [Eze 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003.md). And say, Ye mountains
of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah to the mountains, and to the hills, to the valleys, and to the
low grounds, Behold, I bring the sword upon you, and destroy your high
places. [Eze 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004.md). Your altars shall be
made desolate, and your sun-pillars shall be broken; and I shall make
your slain fall in the presence of your idols. [Eze
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#005.md). And I will lay the corpses of the
children of Israel before their idols, and will scatter your bones round
about your altars. [Eze 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006.md). In all
your dwellings shall the cities be made desolate, and the high places
waste; that your altars may be desolate and waste, and your idols broken
and destroyed, and your sun-pillars hewn down, and the works of your
hands exterminated. [Eze 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#007.md). And the
slain will fall in your midst; that you may know that I am Jehovah. -
With [Eze 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md) cf. [Eze
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#016.md). The prophet is to prophesy
against the mountains of Israel. That the mountains are mentioned ([Eze
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#002).md) as pars pro toto, is seen from
[Eze 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003.md), when to the mountains and
hills are added also the valleys and low grounds, as the places where
idolatry was specially practised; cf. [Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md); [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md); see on Hos. l.c. and [Deu
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002.md). אפיקים, in the older writings,
denotes the "river channels," "the beds of the stream;" but Ezekiel uses
the word as equivalent to valley, i.e., נחל, a valley with a brook or
stream, like the Arabic wady. גּיא, properly "deepening," "the deep
ground," "the deep valley;" on the form גּאיות, cf. Ewald, 186da. The
juxtaposition of mountains and hills, of valleys and low grounds, occurs
again in [Eze 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#004.md), [Eze
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#006.md), and [Eze
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#008.md); the opposition between mountains
and valleys also, in [Eze 32:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#005.md), and
[Eze 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#013.md). The valleys are to be
conceived of as furnished with trees and groves, under the shadow of
which the worship of Astarte especially was practised; see on v. 15. On
the mountains and in the valleys were sanctuaries erected to Baal and
Astarte. The announcement of their destruction is appended to the
threatening in [Lev 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030.md), which
Ezekiel takes up and describes at greater length. Beside the בּמות, the
places of sacrifice and worship, and the חמּנים, pillars or statues of
Baal, dedicated to him as the sun-god, he names also the altars, which,
in Lev. l.c. and other places, are comprehended along with the בּמות eht
htiw; see on [Lev 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030.md) and [Kg1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#003.md). With the destruction of the idol
temples, altars, and statues, the idol-worshippers are also to be
smitten, so as to fall down in the presence of their idols. The
fundamental meaning of the word גּלּוּלים, "idols," borrowed from Lev.
l.c., and frequently employed by Ezekiel, is uncertain; signifying
either "logs of wood," from גּלל, "to roll" (Gesen.), or stercorei, from
גּל, "dung;" not "monuments of stone" (Hvernick). [Eze
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#005.md) is taken quite literally from [Lev
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030.md). The ignominy of the destruction
is heightened by the bones of the slain idolaters being scattered round
about the idol altars. In order that the idolatry may be entirely rooted
out, the cities throughout the whole land, and all the high places, are
to be devastated, [Eze 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006.md). The forms
תּישׁמנה and יאשׁמוּ are probably not to be derived from שׁמם (Ewald,
138b), but to be referred back to a stem-form ישׁם, with the
signification of שׁמם, the existence of which appears certain from the
old name ישׁימון in Ps 68 and elsewhere. The א in יאשׁמו is certainly
only mater lectonis. In [Eze 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#007.md), the
singular חלל stands as indefinitely general. The thought, "slain will
fall in your midst," involves the idea that not all the people will
fall, but that there will survive some who are saved, and prepares for
what follows. The falling of the slain - the idolaters with their idols
- leads to the recognition of Jehovah as the omnipotent God, and to
conversion to Him.

[Ezekiel 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 6:8</span></span>

The survivors shall go away into banishment amongst the heathen, and
shall remember the word of the Lord that will have been fulfilled. -
[Eze 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008.md). But I shall preserve a
remnant, in that there shall be to you some who have escaped the sword
among the nations, when he shall be dispersed among the lands. [Eze
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009.md). And those of you who have
escaped, will make mention of me among the nations whither they are led
captive, when I have broken to me their whorish heart, which had
departed from me, and their eyes, which went a whoring after their
idols: and they shall loathe themselves because of the evil which they
have done in reference to all their abominations. [Eze
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#010.md). And ye shall know that I am
Jehovah. Not in vain have I spoken this evil to you. - הותיר,
superstites facere, "to make or preserve survivors." The connection with
'בּהיות וגו is analogous to the construction of הותיר, in the sense of
"giving a superabundance," with בּ rei, [Deu
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#011.md) and [Deu
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#009.md), and is not to be rejected, with
Ewald and Hitzig, as inadmissible. For בּהיות is supported by the old
versions, and the change of והותרתּי into ודבּרתּי, which would have to
be referred to [Eze 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#007.md), is in
opposition to the twofold repetition of the וידאתּם כּי אן (וידעוּ),
[Eze 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#010.md) and [Eze
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014.md), as this repetition shows that
the thought in [Eze 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#007.md) is different
from that in 17, 21, not "they shall know that Jehovah has spoken," but
"they shall know that He who has done this is Jehovah, the God of
Israel." The preservation of a remnant will be shown in this, that they
shall have some who have escaped the sword. הזּרותיכם is infin. Niph.
with a plural form of the suffix, as occurs elsewhere only with the
plural ending ות of nouns, while Ezekiel has extended it to the ות of
the infinitive of ה''ל verbs; cf. [Eze
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#031.md), and Ewald, 259b. The
remembrance of Jehovah ([Eze 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009).md) is
the commencement of conversion to Him. אשׁר before נשׁבּרתּי is not to
be connected as relative pronoun with לבּם, but is a conjunction, though
not used conditionally, "if," as in [Lev
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md); [Deu
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#027.md), and elsewhere, but of time,
ὅτε, "when," as [Deu 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006.md) and [Ch2
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020.md), and נשׁבּרתּי in the
signification of the futur. exact. The Niphal נשׁבּר here is not to be
taken as passive, but middle, sibi frangere, i.e., לבּם, poenitenti
conterere animum eorum ut ad ipsum (Deum) redeant (Maurer, Hvernick).
Besides the heart, the eyes also are mentioned, which God is to smite,
as the external senses which allure the heart to whoredom. ונקטוּ
corresponds to וזכרוּ at the beginning of the verse. קוּט, "the later
form for קוּץ, "to feel a loathing," Hiphil, "to be filled with
loathing;" cf. [Job 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001.md) with ב
object., "in (on) their פנים, faces," i.e., their persons or themselves:
so also in [Eze 20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043.md); [Eze
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031.md). אל הרעות, in allusion to the
evil things; 'לכל־תועב, in reference to all their abominations. This
fruit, which is produced by chastisement, namely, that he idolaters are
inspired with loathing for themselves, and led to the knowledge of
Jehovah, will furnish the proof that God has not spoken in vain.

[Ezekiel 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 6:11</span></span>

The Punishment Is Just and Well Deserved

[Eze 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011.md). Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Woe on
all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel! that they must
perish by sword, hunger, and pestilence. [Eze
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#012.md). He that is afar off will die by
the pestilence; and he that is near at hand shall fall by the sword; and
he who survives and is preserved will die of hunger: and I shall
accomplish my wrath upon them. [Eze
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#013.md). And ye shall know that I am
Jehovah, when your slain lie in the midst of your idols round about your
altars, on every high hill, upon all the summits of the mountains, and
under every green tree, and under every thick-leaved terebinth, on the
places where they brought their pleasant incense to all their idols.
[Eze 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014.md). And I will stretch out my
hand against them, and make the land waste and desolate more than the
wilderness of Diblath, in all their dwellings: so shall ye know that I
am Jehovah. - Through clapping of the hands and stamping of the feet -
the gestures which indicate violent excitement - the prophet is to make
known to the displeasure of Jehovah at the horrible idolatry of the
people, and thereby make manifest that the penal judgment is well
deserved. הכּה בכפּך is in [Eze 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#019.md)
expressed more distinctly by הך כּף אל , "to strike one hand against the
other," i.e., "to clap the hands;" cf. [Num
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010.md). אח, an exclamation of
lamentation, occurring only here and in [Eze
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#020.md). אשׁר, [Eze
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011.md), is a conjunction, "at." Their
abominations are so wicked, that they must be exterminated on account of
them. This is specially mentioned in [Eze
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#012.md). No one will escape the judgment:
he who is far removed from its scene as little as he who is close at
hand; while he who escapes the pestilence and the sword is to perish of
hunger. נצוּר, servatus, preserved, as in [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006.md). The signification "besieged"
(lxx, Vulgate, Targum, etc.), Hitzig can only maintain by arbitrarily
expunging הנּשׁאר as a gloss. On [Eze
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#012.md), cf. [Eze
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013.md); on 13a, cf. [Eze
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#005.md); and on 13b, cf. [Eze
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003.md), and [Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md); [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md); [Deu
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002.md). 'אל כּל־גב, according to later
usage, for על כּל־גב. ריח ניחח, used in the Pentateuch of sacrifices
pleasing to God, is here transferred to idol sacrifices; see on [Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md) and [Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md). On account of the prevalence of
idolatry in all parts, God will make the land entirely desolate. The
union of שׁממה serves to strengthen the idea; cf. [Eze
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#008.md)., [Eze
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#003.md). The words ממּדבּר דּבלתה are
obscure, either "in the wilderness towards Diblath" (even to Diblath),
or "more than the wilderness of Diblath" (מן of comparison). There is no
doubt that דּבלתה is a nom. prop.; cf. the name of the city דּבלתים in
[Jer 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#022.md); [Num
33:46](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#046.md). The second acceptation of the
words is more probable than the first. For, if ממּדבּר is the terminus a
quo, and דּבלתה the terminus ad quem of the extent of the land, then
must ממּדבּר be punctuated not only as status absolut., but it must also
have the article; because a definite wilderness - that, namely, of
Arabia - is meant. The omission of the article cannot be justified by
reference to [Eze 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003.md) or to [Psa
75:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#007) (Hitzig, Ewald.md), because both
passages contain general designations of the quarters of the world, with
which the article is always omitted. In the next place, no Dibla can be
pointed out in the north; and the change of Diblatha into Ribla, already
proposed by Jerome, and more recently brought forward again by J. D.
Michaelis, has not only against it the authority of all the old
versions, but also the circumstance that the Ribla mentioned in [Kg2
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033.md) did not form the northern
boundary of Palestine, but lay on the other side of it, in the land of
Hamath; while the הרבלה, named in [Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011.md), is a place on the eastern
boundary to the north of the Sea of Gennesareth, which would, moreover,
be inappropriate as a designation of the northern boundary. Finally, the
extent of the land from the south to the north is constantly expressed
in a different way; cf. [Num 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021.md)
([Num 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008).md); [Jos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005.md); [Kg1
8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md); 2 Kings 14:65; [Amo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#014.md); [Ch1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005.md); [Ch2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008.md); and even by Ezekiel himself ([Eze
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001).md) לבוא is named as the boundary on
the north. The form דּבלתה is similar to תּמנתה for תּמנה, although the
name is hardly to be explained, with Hvernick, as an appellation, after
the Arabic dibl, calamitas, exitium. The wilderness of Diblah is
unknown. With 'וידעוּ כּי וגו the discourse is rounded off in returning
to the beginning of [Eze 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#013.md), while
the thoughts in [Eze 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#013.md) and [Eze
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014.md) are only a variation of [Eze
6:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004.md).
