### [Exodus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

Increase in the Number of the IsraelitesTheir Bondage in Egypt - Exodus
1

The promise which God gave to Jacob in his departure from Canaan ([Gen
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003).md) was perfectly fulfilled. The
children of Israel settled down in the most fruitful province of the
fertile land of Egypt, and grew there into a great nation ([Exo
1:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001).md). But the words which the Lord
had spoken to Abram ([Gen 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013).md) were
also fulfilled in relation to his seed in Egypt. The children of Israel
were oppressed in a strange land, were compelled to serve the Egyptians
([Exo 1:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008).md), and were in great
danger of being entirely crushed by them ([Exo
1:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015).md).

[Exodus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 1:1</span></span>

To place the multiplication of the children of Israel into a strong
nation in its true light, as the commencement of the realization of the
promises of God, the number of the souls that went down with Jacob to
Egypt is repeated from [Gen 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027.md) (on
the number 70, in which Jacob is included, see the notes on this
passage); and the repetition of the names of the twelve sons of Jacob
serves to give to the history which follows a character of completeness
within itself. "With Jacob they came, every one and his house," i.e.,
his sons, together with their families, their wives, and their children.
The sons are arranged according to their mothers, as in [Gen
35:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#023.md), and the sons of the two
maid-servants stand last. Joseph, indeed, is not placed in the list, but
brought into special prominence by the words, "for Joseph was in Egypt"
([Exo 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#005).md), since he did not go down
to Egypt along with the house of Jacob, and occupied an exalted position
in relation to them there.

[Exodus 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 1:6</span></span>

After the death of Joseph and his brethren and the whole of the family
that had first immigrated, there occurred that miraculous increase in
the number of the children of Israel, by which the blessings of creation
and promise were fully realised. The words פּרוּ ישׁרצוּ (swarmed), and
ירבּוּ point back to [Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028.md) and
[Gen 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#017.md), and יעצמוּ to עצוּם גּוי in
[Gen 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#018.md). "The land was filled with
them," i.e., the land of Egypt, particularly Goshen, where they were
settled ([Gen 47:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#011).md). The
extra-ordinary fruitfulness of Egypt in both men and cattle is attested
not only by ancient writers, but by modern travellers also (vid.,
Aristotelis hist. animal. vii. 4, 5; Columella de re rust. iii. 8; Plin.
hist. n. vii. 3; also Rosenmller a. und n. Morgenland i. p. 252). This
blessing of nature was heightened still further in the case of the
Israelites by the grace of the promise, so that the increase became
extraordinarily great (see the comm. on [Exo
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037).md).

[Exodus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 1:8</span></span>

The promised blessing was manifested chiefly in the fact, that all the
measures adopted by the cunning of Pharaoh to weaken and diminish the
Israelites, instead of checking, served rather to promote their
continuous increase.

[Exo 1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008.md)

"There arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph." ויּקם
signifies he came to the throne, קוּם denoting his appearance in
history, as in [Deu 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010.md). A "new
king" (lxx: βασιλεὺς ἕτερος; the other ancient versions, rex novus) is a
king who follows different principles of government from his
predecessors. Cf. חדשׁים אלהים, "new gods," in distinction from the God
that their fathers had worshipped, [Jdg
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#008.md); [Deu
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017.md). That this king belonged to a
new dynasty, as the majority of commentators follow Josephus

(Note: Ant. ii. 9, 1. Τῆς βασιλέιας εἰς ἄλλον οἶκον μεταληλυθυΐ́ας.)

in assuming, cannot be inferred with certainty from the predicate new;
but it is very probable, as furnishing the readiest explanation of the
change in the principles of government. The question itself, however, is
of no direct importance in relation to theology, though it has
considerable interest in connection with Egyptological researches.

(Note: The want of trustworthy accounts of the history of ancient Egypt
and its rulers precludes the possibility of bringing this question to a
decision. It is true that attempts have been made to mix it up in
various ways with the statements which Josephus has transmitted from
Manetho with regard to the rule of the Hyksos in Egypt (c. Ap. i. 14 and
26), and the rising up of the "new king" has been identified sometimes
with the commencement of the Hyksos rule, and at other times with the
return of the native dynasty on the expulsion of the Hyksos. But just as
the accounts of the ancients with regard to the Hyksos bear throughout
the stamp of very distorted legends and exaggerations, so the attempts
of modern inquirers to clear up the confusion of these legends, and to
bring out the historical truth that lies at the foundation of them all,
have led to nothing but confused and contradictory hypotheses; so that
the greatest Egyptologists of our own days, - viz., Lepsius, Bunsen, and
Brugsch - differ throughout, and are even diametrically opposed to one
another in their views respecting the dynasties of Egypt. Not a single
trace of the Hyksos dynasty is to be found either in or upon the ancient
monuments. The documental proofs of the existence of a dynasty of
foreign kings, which the Vicomte de Roug thought that he had discovered
in the Papyrus Sallier No. 1 of the British Museum, and which Brugsch
pronounced "an Egyptian document concerning the Hyksos period," have
since then been declared untenable both by Brugsch and Lepsius, and
therefore given up again. Neither Herodotus nor Diodorus Siculus heard
anything at all about the Hyksos though the former made very minute
inquiry of the Egyptian priests of Memphis and Heliopolis. And lastly,
the notices of Egypt and its kings, which we meet with in Genesis and
Exodus, do not contain the slightest intimation that there were foreign
kings ruling there either in Joseph's or Moses' days, or that the
genuine Egyptian spirit which pervades these notices was nothing more
than the "outward adoption" of Egyptian customs and modes of thought. If
we add to this the unquestionably legendary character of the Manetho
accounts, there is always the greatest probability in the views of those
inquirers who regard the two accounts given by Manetho concerning the
Hyksos as two different forms of one and the same legend, and the
historical fact upon which this legend was founded as being the 430
years' sojourn of the Israelites, which had been thoroughly distorted in
the national interests of Egypt. - For a further expansion and defence
of this view see Hvernick's Einleitung in d. A. T. i. 2, pp. 338ff., Ed.
2 (Introduction to the Pentateuch, pp. 235ff. English translation).)

The new king did not acknowledge Joseph, i.e., his great merits in
relation to Egypt. ידע לא signifies here, not to perceive, or
acknowledge, in the sense of not wanting to know anything about him, as
in [Sa1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012.md), etc. In the natural
course of things, the merits of Joseph might very well have been
forgotten long before; for the multiplication of the Israelites into a
numerous people, which had taken place in the meantime, is a sufficient
proof that a very long time had elapsed since Joseph's death. At the
same time such forgetfulness does not usually take place all at once,
unless the account handed down has been intentionally obscured or
suppressed. If the new king, therefore, did not know Joseph, the reason
must simply have been, that he did not trouble himself about the past,
and did not want to know anything about the measures of his predecessors
and the events of their reigns. The passage is correctly paraphrased by
Jonathan thus: non agnovit (חכּים) Josephum nec ambulavit in statutis
ejus. Forgetfulness of Joseph brought the favour shown to the Israelites
by the kings of Egypt to a close. As they still continued foreigners
both in religion and customs, their rapid increase excited distrust in
the mind of the king, and induced him to take steps for staying their
increase and reducing their strength. The statement that "the people of
the children of Israel" (ישׂראל בּני עם lit., "nation, viz., the sons of
Israel;" for עם with the dist. accent is not the construct state, and
ישראל בני is in apposition, cf. Ges. 113) were "more and mightier" than
the Egyptians, is no doubt an exaggeration.

[Exo 1:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#010.md)

"Let us deal wisely with them," i.e., act craftily towards them. התחכּם,
sapiensem se gessit ([Ecc 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016).md), is
used here of political craftiness, or worldly wisdom combined with craft
and cunning (κατασοφισώμεθα, lxx), and therefore is altered into התנכּל
in [Psa 105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025.md) (cf. [Gen
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#018).md). The reason assigned by the
king for the measures he was about to propose, was the fear that in case
of war the Israelites might make common cause with his enemies, and then
remove from Egypt. It was not the conquest of his kingdom that he was
afraid of, but alliance with his enemies and emigration. עלה is used
here, as in [Gen 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md), etc., to denote
removal from Egypt to Canaan. He was acquainted with the home of the
Israelites therefore, and cannot have been entirely ignorant of the
circumstances of their settlement in Egypt. But he regarded them as his
subjects, and was unwilling that they should leave the country, and
therefore was anxious to prevent the possibility of their emancipating
themselves in the event of war. - In the form תּקראנה for תּקרינה,
according to the frequent interchange of the forms הל and אל (vid., [Gen
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#004).md), nh is transferred from the
feminine plural to the singular, to distinguish the 3rd pers. fem. from
the 2nd pers., as in [Jdg 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#026.md); [Job
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016.md) (vid., Ewald, 191c, and Ges. 47,
3, Anm. 3). Consequently there is no necessity either to understand
מלחמה collectively as signifying soldiers, or to regard תּקראנוּ drager
ot , the reading adopted by the lxx (συμβῆ ἡμῖν), the Samaritan,
Chaldee, Syriac, and Vulgate, as "certainly the original," as Knobel has
done.

The first measure adopted ([Exo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011).md)
consisted in the appointment of taskmasters over the Israelites, to bend
them down by hard labour. מסּים שׂרי bailiffs over the serfs. מסּים from
מס signifies, not feudal service, but feudal labourers, serfs (see my
Commentary on [Kg1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006).md). ענּה to bend,
to wear out any one's strength ([Psa
102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024).md). By hard feudal labour (סבלות
burdens, burdensome toil) Pharaoh hoped, according to the ordinary
maxims of tyrants (Aristot. polit., 5, 9; Liv. hist. i. 56, 59), to
break down the physical strength of Israel and lessen its increase-since
a population always grows more slowly under oppression than in the midst
of prosperous circumstances-and also to crush their spirit so as to
banish the very wish for liberty. - ויּבן - .ytrebil r, and so Israel
built (was compelled to build) provision or magazine cities vid., [Ch2
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#028.md), cities for the storing of the
harvest), in which the produce of the land was housed, partly for
purposes of trade, and partly for provisioning the army in time of war;
- not fortresses, πόλεις ὀχυραί, as the lxx have rendered it. Pithom was
Πάτουμος; it was situated, according to Herodotus (2, 158), upon the
canal which commenced above Bybastus and connected the Nile with the Red
Sea. This city is called Thou or Thoum in the Itiner. Anton., the
Egyptian article pi being dropped, and according to Jomard (descript. t.
9, p. 368) is to be sought for on the site of the modern Abassieh in the
Wady Tumilat. - Raemses (cf. [Gen
47:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#011).md) was the ancient Heroopolis, and
is not to be looked for on the site of the modern Belbeis. In support of
the latter supposition, Stickel, who agrees with Kurtz and Knobel,
adduces chiefly the statement of the Egyptian geographer Makrizi, that
in the (Jews') book of the law Belbeis is called the land of Goshen, in
which Jacob dwelt when he came to his son Joseph, and that the capital
of the province was el Sharkiyeh. This place is a day's journey (for as
others affirm, 14 hours) to the north-east of Cairo on the Syrian and
Egyptian road. It served as a meeting-place in the middle ages for the
caravans from Egypt to Syria and Arabia (Ritter, Erdkunde 14, p. 59). It
is said to have been in existence before the Mohammedan conquest of
Egypt. But the clue cannot be traced any farther back; and it is too far
from the Red Sea for the Raemses of the Bible (vid., [Exo
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037).md). The authority of Makrizi is
quite counterbalanced by the much older statement of the Septuagint, in
which Jacob is made to meet his son Joseph in Heroopolis; the words of
[Gen 46:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#029.md), "and Joseph went up to
meet Israel his father to Goshen," being rendered thus: εἰς συϚάϚτησιν
Ἰσραὴλ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦκαθ ̓ Ἡρώων πόλιν. Hengstenberg is not correct in
saying that the later name Heroopolis is here substituted for the older
name Raemses; and Gesenius, Kurtz, and Knobel are equally wrong in
affirming that καθ ̓ ἩρώωϚ πόλιν is supplied ex ingenio suo; but the
place of meeting, which is given indefinitely as Goshen in the original,
is here distinctly named. Now if this more precise definition is not an
arbitrary conjecture of the Alexandrian translators, but sprang out of
their acquaintance with the country, and is really correct, as Kurtz has
no doubt, it follows that Heroopolis belongs to the γῆ Ῥαμεσσῆ ([Gen
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#028), lxx.md), or was situated within
it. But this district formed the centre of the Israelitish settlement in
Goshen; for according to [Gen 47:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#011.md),
Joseph gave his father and brethren "a possession in the best of the
land, in the land of Raemses." Following this passage, the lxx have also
rendered גּשׁן ארצה in [Gen 46:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#028.md) by
εἰς γῆν Ῥαμεσσῆ, whereas in other places the land of Goshen is simply
called γῆ Γεσέμ ([Gen 45:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#010.md); [Gen
46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034.md); [Gen
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#001), etc..md). But if Heroopolis
belonged to the γῆ Ῥαμεσσῆ, or the province of Raemses, which formed the
centre of the land of Goshen that was assigned to the Israelites, this
city must have stood in the immediate neighbourhood of Raemses, or have
been identical with it. Now, since the researches of the scientific men
attached to the great French expedition, it has been generally admitted
that Heroopolis occupied the site of the modern Abu Keisheib in the Wady
Tumilat, between Thoum = Pithom and the Birket Temsah or Crocodile Lake;
and according to the Itiner. p. 170, it was only 24 Roman miles to the
east of Pithom, - a position that was admirably adapted not only for a
magazine, but also for the gathering-place of Israel prior to their
departure ([Exo 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037).md).

But Pharaoh's first plan did not accomplish his purpose ([Exo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#012).md). The multiplication of Israel
went on just in proportion to the amount of the oppression (כּן = כּאשׁר
prout, ita; פּרץ as in [Gen 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#030.md);
[Gen 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014).md), so that the Egyptians
were dismayed at the Israelites (קוּץ to feel dismay, or fear, [Num
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#003).md). In this increase of their
numbers, which surpassed all expectation, there was the manifestation of
a higher, supernatural, and to them awful power. But instead of bowing
before it, they still endeavoured to enslave Israel through hard servile
labour. In [Exo 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#013.md), [Exo
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#014.md) we have not an account of any
fresh oppression; but "the crushing by hard labour" is represented as
enslaving the Israelites and embittering their lives. פּרך hard
oppression, from the Chaldee פּרך to break or crush in pieces. "They
embittered their life with hard labour in clay and bricks (making clay
into bricks, and working with the bricks when made), and in all kinds of
labour in the field (this was very severe in Egypt on account of the
laborious process by which the ground was watered, [Deu
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#010).md), כּל־עבדתם את with regard to
all their labour, which they worked (i.e., performed) through them
(viz., the Israelites) with severe oppression." כל־ע את is also
dependent upon ימררו, as a second accusative (Ewald, 277d). Bricks of
clay were the building materials most commonly used in Egypt. The
employment of foreigners in this kind of labour is to be seen
represented in a painting, discovered in the ruins of Thebes, and given
in the Egyptological works of Rosellini and Wilkinson, in which workmen
who are evidently not Egyptians are occupied in making bricks, whilst
two Egyptians with sticks are standing as overlookers; - even if the
labourers are not intended for the Israelites, as the Jewish
physiognomies would lead us to suppose. (For fuller details, see
Hengstenberg's Egypt and the Books of Moses, p. 80ff. English
translation).

[Exodus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 1:15</span></span>

As the first plan miscarried, the king proceeded to try a second, and
that a bloody act of cruel despotism. He commanded the midwives to
destroy the male children in the birth and to leave only the girls
alive. The midwives named in [Exo
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015.md), who are not Egyptian but Hebrew
women, were no doubt the heads of the whole profession, and were
expected to communicate their instructions to their associates. ויּאמר
in [Exo 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#016.md) resumes the address
introduced by ויאמר in [Exo 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015.md). The
expression על־האבנים, of which such various renderings have been given,
is used in [Jer 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#003.md) to denote the
revolving table of a potter, i.e., the two round discs between which a
potter forms his earthenware vessels by turning, and appears to be
transferred here to the vagina out of which the child twists itself, as
it were like the vessel about to be formed out of the potter's discs.
Knobel has at length decided in favour of this explanation, at which the
Targumists hint with their מתברא. When the midwives were called in to
assist at a birth, they were to look carefully at the vagina; and if the
child were a boy, they were to destroy it as it came out of the womb.
וחיה for חייה rof ו from חיי, see [Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022.md). The w takes kametz before the
major pause, as in [Gen 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#009.md) (cf.
Ewald, 243a).

[Exodus 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 1:17</span></span>

But the midwives feared God (ha-Elohim, the personal, true God), and did
not execute the king's command.

[Exodus 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 1:18</span></span>

When questioned upon the matter, the explanation which they gave was,
that the Hebrew women were not like the delicate women of Egypt, but
were חיות "vigorous" (had much vital energy: Abenezra), so that they
gave birth to their children before the midwives arrived. They succeeded
in deceiving the king with this reply, as childbirth is remarkably rapid
and easy in the case of Arabian women (see Burckhardt, Beduinen, p. 78;
Tischendorf, Reise i. p. 108).

[Exodus 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 1:20</span></span>

God rewarded them for their conduct, and "made them houses," i.e., gave
them families and preserved their posterity. In this sense to "make a
house" in [Sa2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011.md) is interchanged
with to "build a house" in [Sa2 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#027.md)
(vid., [Rut 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011).md). להם for להן as in
[Gen 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#009.md), etc. Through not carrying
out the ruthless command of the king, they had helped to build up the
families of Israel, and their own families were therefore built up by
God. Thus God rewarded them, "not, however, because they lied, but
because they were merciful to the people of God; it was not their
falsehood therefore that was rewarded, but their kindness (more
correctly, their fear of God), their benignity of mind, not the
wickedness of their lying; and for the sake of what was good, God
forgave what was evil." (Augustine, contra mendac. c. 19.)

[Exodus 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 1:22</span></span>

The failure of his second plan drove the king to acts of open violence.
He issued commands to all his subjects to throw every Hebrew boy that
was born into the river (i.e., the Nile). The fact, that this command,
if carried out, would necessarily have resulted in the extermination of
Israel, did not in the least concern the tyrant; and this cannot be
adduced as forming any objection to the historical credibility of the
narrative, since other cruelties of a similar kind are to be found
recorded in the history of the world. Clericus has cited the conduct of
the Spartans towards the helots. Nor can the numbers of the Israelites
at the time of the exodus be adduced as a proof that no such murderous
command can ever have been issued; for nothing more can be inferred from
this, than that the command was neither fully executed nor long
regarded, as the Egyptians were not all so hostile to the Israelites as
to be very zealous in carrying it out, and the Israelites would
certainly neglect no means of preventing its execution. Even Pharaoh's
obstinate refusal to let the people go, though it certainly is
inconsistent with the intention to destroy them, cannot shake the truth
of the narrative, but may be accounted for on psychological grounds,
from the very nature of pride and tyranny which often act in the most
reckless manner without at all regarding the consequences, or on
historical grounds, from the supposition not only that the king who
refused the permission to depart was a different man from the one who
issued the murderous edicts (cf. [Exo
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023).md), but that when the oppression
had continued for some time the Egyptian government generally discovered
the advantage they derived from the slave labour of the Israelites, and
hoped through a continuance of that oppression so to crush and break
their spirits, as to remove all ground for fearing either rebellion, or
alliance with their foes.
