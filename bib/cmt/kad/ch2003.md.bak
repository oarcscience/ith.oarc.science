[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 3:0</span></span>

The Building of the Temple - 2 Chronicles 3-5:1 (Cf. 1 Kings 6;
7:13-51.)

The description of the building begins with a statement of the place
where and of the time when the temple was built ([Ch2
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001).md). Then follows an account of the
proportions of the building, a description of the individual parts,
commencing on the outside and advancing inwards. First we have the porch
([Ch2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003.md), [Ch2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004).md), then the house, i.e., the
interior apartment or the holy place ([Ch2
3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#005).md), then the holiest of all, and
cherubim therein ([Ch2 3:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#008).md), and
the veil of partition between the holy place and the most holy ([Ch2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#014).md). After that we have the
furniture of the court, the pillars of the porch ([Ch2
3:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#015).md), the brazen altar ([Ch2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001).md), the brazen sea ([Ch2
4:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#002).md), the ten lavers ([Ch2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006).md), the furniture of the holy place,
candlesticks and tables ([Ch2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007.md),
[Ch2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#008).md), and of the two courts ([Ch2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009.md), [Ch2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#010).md), and finally a summary
enumeration of the brazen and golden utensils of the temple ([Ch2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011.md), [Ch2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#012).md). The description in 1 Kings 6
and 7 is differently arranged; the divine promise which Solomon received
while the building was in progress, and a description of the building of
the palace, being inserted: see on 1 Kings 6 and 7.

[2 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 3:1</span></span>

The building of the temple. - [Ch2
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001.md). The statements as to the place
where the temple was built ([Ch2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001).md)
are found here only. Mount Moriah is manifestly the mountain in the land
of Moriah where Abraham was to have sacrificed his son Isaac ([Gen
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002).md), which had received the name
המּוריּה, i.e., "the appearance of Jahve," from that event. It is the
mountain which lies to the north-east of Zion, now called Haram after
the most sacred mosque of the Mohammedans, which is built there; cf.
Rosen, das Haram von Jerusalem, Gotha 1866. לד נראה אשׁר is usually
translated: "which was pointed out to David his father." But ראה has not
in Niphal the signification "to be pointed out," which is peculiar to
the Hophal (cf. [Exo 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040.md); [Exo
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#030.md); [Deu
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#035), etc..md); it means only "to be
seen," "to let oneself be seen," to appear, especially used of
appearances of God. It cannot be shown to be anywhere used of a place
which lets itself be seen, or appears to one. We must therefore
translate: "on mount Moriah, where He had appeared to David his father."
The unexpressed subject יהוה is easily supplied from the context; and
with אשׁר בּהר, "on the mountain where," cf. אשׁר בּמּקום, [Gen
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#013.md)., and Ew. 331, c, 3. הכין אשׁר
is separated from what precedes, and connected with what follows, by the
Athnach under אביהוּ, and is translated, after the lxx, Vulg., and Syr.,
as a hyperbaton thus: "in the place where David had prepared," scil. the
building of the temple by the laying up of the materials there ([Ch1
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#005.md); [Ch1
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002).md). But there are no proper
analogies to such a hyperbaton, since [Jer
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001.md) and [Jer
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md) are differently constituted.
Berth. therefore is of opinion that our text can only signify, "which
temple he prepared on the place of David," and that this reading cannot
be the original, because הכין occurs elsewhere only of David's activity
in preparing for the building of the temple, and "place of David"
cannot, without further ceremony, mean the place which David had chosen.
He would therefore transpose the words thus: דויד הכין אשׁר בּמקום. But
this conjecture is by no means certain. In the first place, the mere
transposition of the words is not sufficient; we must also alter בּמקום
into בּמּקום, to get the required sense; and, further, Bertheau's
reasons are not conclusive. הכין means not merely to make ready for
(zursten), to prepare, but also to make ready, make (bereiten), found
e.g., [Kg1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#019.md); [Ezr
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003.md); and the frequent use of this word
in reference to David's action in preparing for the building of the
temple does not prove that it has this signification here also. The
clause may be quite well translated, with J. J. Rambach: "quam domum
praeparavit (Salomo) in loco Davidis." The expression "David's place,"
for "place which David had fixed upon," cannot in this connection be
misunderstood, but yet it cannot be denied that the clause is stiff and
constrained if we refer it to יהוה את־בּית. We would therefore prefer to
give up the Masoretic punctuation, and construe the words otherwise,
connecting הכין אשׁר with the preceding thus: where Jahve had appeared
to his father David, who had prepared (the house, i.e., the building of
it), and make בּמקום ד, with the following designation of the place, to
depend upon לבנות as a further explanation of the הם בּהר, viz., in the
place of David, i.e., on the place fixed by David on the threshing-floor
of the Jebusite Ornan; cf. [Ch1 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#018.md).
- In [Ch2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#002.md) לבנות ויּחל is repeated
in order to fix the time of the building. In [Kg1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md) the time is fixed by its relation
to the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. בּשּׁני, which the older
commentators always understood of the second day of the month, is
strange. Elsewhere the day of the month is always designated by the
cardinal number with the addition of לחרשׁ or יום, the month having been
previously given. Berth. therefore considers בּשּׁני to be a gloss which
has come into the text by a repetition of השּׁני, since the lxx and
Vulg. have not expressed it.

[2 Chronicles 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 3:3</span></span>

"And this is Solomon's founding, to build the house of God;" i.e., this
is the foundation which Solomon laid for the building of the house of
God. The infin. Hoph. הוּסד is used here and in [Ezr
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011.md) substantively. The measurements
only of the length and breadth of the building are given; the height,
which is stated in [Kg1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002.md), is
omitted here. The former, i.e., the ancient measurement, is the Mosaic
or sacred cubit, which, according to [Eze
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md) and [Eze
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013.md), was a handbreadth longer than
the civil cubit of the earlier time; see on [Kg1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002.md).

[2 Chronicles 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 3:4</span></span>

The porch and the interior of the holy place. - [Ch2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004.md). The porch which was before (i.e.,
in front of) the length (of the house), was twenty cubits before the
breadth of the house, i.e., was as broad as the house. So understood,
the words give an intelligible sense. הארך with the article refers back
to הארך in [Ch2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003.md) (the length of the
house), and על־פּני in the two defining clauses means "in front;" but in
the first clause it is "lying in front of the house," i.e., built in
front; in the second it is "measured across the front of the breadth of
the house."

(Note: There is consequently no need to alter the text according to [Kg1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003.md), from which passage Berth. would
interpolate the words פּניו על רחבּו בּאמּה ר עשׂר הבּית between על־פּני
and הארך, and thereby get the signification: "and the porch which is
before the house, ten cubits is its breadth before the same, and the
length which is before the breadth twenty cubits." But this conjecture
is neither necessary nor probable. It is not necessary, for (1) the
present text gives an intelligible sense; (2) the assertion that the
length and breadth of the porch must be stated cannot be justified, if
for no other reason, for this, that even of the main buildings all three
dimensions are not given, only two being stated, and that it was not the
purpose of the author of the Chronicle to give an architecturally
complete statement, his main anxiety being to supply a general idea of
the splendour of the temple. It is not probable; because the chronicler,
if he had followed [Kg1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003.md), would not
have written על־פּניו, but הבּית על־פּני, and instead of הארך would have
written וערכּי, to correspond with רחבּו.)

There is certainly either a corruption of the text, or a wrong number in
the statement of the height of the porch, 120 cubits; for a front 120
cubits high to a house only thirty cubits high could not be called
אוּלם; it would have been a מגדּל, a tower. It cannot with certainty be
determined whether we should read twenty or thirty cubits; see in [Kg1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003). He overlaid it (the porch.md) with
pure gold; cf. [Kg1 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#021.md).

[Ch2 3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#005.md)

The interior of the holy place. - [Ch2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#005.md). The "great house," i.e., the
large apartment of the house, the holy place, he wainscotted with
cypresses, and overlaid it with good gold, and carved thereon palms and
garlands. חפּה from חפה, to cover, cover over, alternates with the
synonymous צפּה in the signification to coat or overlay with wood and
gold. תּמּרים .dlo as in [Eze 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#018.md),
for תּמּרות, [Kg1 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029.md), [Kg1
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#035.md), are artificial palms as wall
ornaments. שׁרשׁרות are in [Exo 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#014.md)
small scroll-formed chains of gold wire, here spiral chain-like
decorations on the walls, garlands of flowers carved on the wainscot, as
we learn from [Kg1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#018.md).

[Ch2 3:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#006.md)

And he garnished the house with precious stones for ornament (of the
inner sides of the walls); cf. [Ch1
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002.md), on which Bhr on [Kg1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#007.md) appositely remarks, that the
ornamenting of the walls with precious stones is very easily credible,
since among the things which Solomon brought in quantity from Ophir they
are expressly mentioned ([Kg1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011).md),
and it was a common custom in the East so to employ them in buildings
and in vessels; cf. Symbolik des mos. Cult. i. S. 280, 294, 297. The
gold was from פּרוים. This, the name of a place rich in gold, does not
elsewhere occur, and has not as yet been satisfactorily explained.
Gesen. with Wilson compares the Sanscrit parvam, the first, foremost,
and takes it to be the name of the foremost, i.e., eastern regions;
others hold the word to be the name of some city in southern or eastern
Arabia, whence Indian gold was brought to Palestine. - In [Ch2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#007.md) the garnishing of the house with
gold is more exactly and completely described. He garnished the house,
the beams (of the roof), the thresholds (of the doors), and its walls
and its doors with gold, and carved cherubs on the walls. For details as
to the internal garnishing, decoration, and gilding of the house, see
[Kg1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#018.md), [Kg1
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029.md), and [Kg1
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#030.md), and for the doors, [Kg1
6:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#032.md).

[2 Chronicles 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 3:8</span></span>

The most holy place, with the figures of the cherubim and the veil; cf.
[Kg1 6:19-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#019.md). - The length of the most
holy place in front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits,
consequently measured in the same way as the porch ([Ch2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004).md); the breadth, i.e., the depth of
it, also twenty cubits. The height, which was the same ([Kg1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020).md), is not stated; but instead of
that we have the weight of the gold which was used for the gilding,
which is omitted in 1 Kings 6, viz., 600 talents for the overlaying of
the walls, and 50 shekels for the nails to fasten the sheet gold on the
wainscotting. He covered the upper chambers of the most holy place also
with gold; see [Ch1 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011.md). This is not
noticed in 1 Kings 6.

[2 Chronicles 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 3:10</span></span>

The figures of the cherubim are called צעצעים מעשׂה, sculpture work. The
ἁπ. λεγ.. צעצעים comes from צוּע, Arab. ṣâǵ, formavit, finxit, and
signifies sculptures. The plur. יצפּוּ, "they overlaid them," is
indefinite. The length of the wings was five cubits, and the four
outspread wings extended across the whole width of the most holy place
from one wall to the other. The repetition of the clauses האהר
הכּרוּב...האהד כּנף ([Ch2 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#011.md), [Ch2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#012).md) has a distributive force: the
top of one wing of each cherub reached the wall of the house, that of
the other wing reached the wing of the other cherub standing by. In the
repetition the masc. מגּיע alternates with the fem. מגּעת, being
construed in a freer way as the principal gender with the fem. כּנף, and
also with דּבקה, adhaerebat, in the last clause. - In [Ch2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#012.md) Bertheau would strike out the
word כּנפי because it does not suit פּרשׂים, which occurs in [Ch1
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#017.md); [Ch2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#008.md); [Kg1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#007.md), in the transitive signification,
"to stretch out the wings." But nothing is gained by that, for we must
then supply the erased word after פּרשׂים again. And, moreover, the
succeeding clause is introduced by והם, just because in the first clause
the wings, and not the cherubim, were the subject. We hold the text to
be correct, and translate: "the wings of these cherubim were, for they
stretched them out, twenty cubits." והם refers to הכּרוּבים. They stood
upon their feet, consequently upright, and were, according to [Kg1
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#026.md), ten cubits high. "And their
faces towards the house," i.e., turned towards the holy place, not
having their faces turned towards each other, as was the case with the
cherubim upon the Capporeth ([Exo
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020).md).

[2 Chronicles 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 3:14</span></span>

The veil between the holy place and the most holy, not mentioned in [Kg1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#021.md), was made of the same materials
and colours as the veil on the tabernacle, and was inwoven with similar
cherub figures; cf. [Exo 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md). וּבוּץ
כּרמיל as in [Ch2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013.md). עלה על, to
bring upon; an indefinite expression for: to weave into the material.

[2 Chronicles 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 3:15</span></span>

The two brazen pillars before the house, i.e., before the porch, whose
form is more accurately described in [Kg1
7:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#015.md). The height of it is here
given at thirty-five cubits, while, according to [Kg1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#015.md); [Kg2
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#017.md); [Jer
52:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#021.md), it was only eighteen cubits.
The number thirty-five has arisen by confounding יח = 18 with לה = 35;
see on [Kg1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016). הצּפת (ἁπ. λεγ..md)
from צפה, overlay, cover, is the hood of the pillar, i.e., the capital,
called in [Kg1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016.md). כּתרת, crown,
capital, five cubits high, as in [Kg1
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016.md).

[Ch2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#016.md)

"And he made little chains on the collar (Halsreife), and put it on the
top of the pillars, and made 100 pomegranates, and put them on the
chains." In the first clause of this verse, בּדּביר, "in (on) the most
holy place," has no meaning, for the most holy place is not here being
discussed, but the pillars before the porch, or rather an ornament on
the capital of these pillars. We must not therefore think of chains in
the most holy place, which extended thence out to the pillars, as the
Syriac and Arabic seem to have done, paraphrasing as they do: chains of
fifty cubits (i.e., the length of the holy place and the porch).
According to [Kg1 7:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#017.md) and [Kg1
7:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#041.md)., compared with [Ch2
4:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#012.md), each capital consisted of two
parts. The lower part was a circumvolution (Wulst) covered with
chain-like net-work, one cubit high, with a setting of carved
pomegranates one row above and one row below. The upper part, or that
which formed the crown of the capital, was four cubits high, and carved
in the form of an open lily-calyx. In our verse it is the lower part of
the capital, the circumvolution, with the chain net-work and the
pomegranates, which is spoken of. From this, Bertheau concludes that
דּביר must signify the same as the more usual שׂבכה, viz., "the
lattice-work which was set about the top of the pillars, and served to
fasten the pomegranates," and that bdbyr has arisen out of בּרביד by a
transposition of the letters. בּרביד (chains) should be read here. This
conjecture so decidedly commends itself, that we regard it as certainly
correct, since רביד denotes in [Gen
41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042.md); [Eze
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#011.md), a necklace, and so may easily
denote also a ring or hoop; but we cannot adopt the translation "chains
on a ring," nor the idea that the שׂבכה, since it surrounded the head of
the pillars as a girdle or broad ring, is called the ring of the
pillars. For this idea does not agree with the translation "chains in a
ring," even when they are conceived of as "chain-like ornaments, which
could scarcely otherwise be made visible on the ring than by open work."
Then the chain-like decorations were not, as Bertheau thinks, on the
upper and under border of the ring, but formed a net-work which
surrounded the lower part of the capital of the pillar like a ring, as
though a necklace had been drawn round it. רביד consequently is not the
same as שׂבכה, but rather corresponds to that part of the capital which
is called גּלּה (גּלּות) in [Kg1 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#014.md);
for the שׂבכות served to cover the גּלּות, and were consequently placed
on or over the גּלּות, as the pomegranates were on the chains or woven
work. הגּלּה denotes the curve, the circumvolution, which is in [Kg1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020.md) called הבּטן, a broad-arched
band, bulging towards the middle, which formed the lower part of the
capital. This arched part of the capital the author of the Chronicle
calls רביד, ring or collar, because it may be regarded as the neck
ornament of the head of the pillar, in contrast to the upper part of the
capital, that consisted in lily-work, i.e., the ball wrought into the
form of an open lily-calyx (כּתרת( xylac-).

[Ch2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#017.md)

As to the position of the pillars, and their names, see on [Kg1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021.md).
