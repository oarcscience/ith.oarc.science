### [Isaiah Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 30:1</span></span>

The plan which, according to [Isa
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015.md), was already projected and
prepared in the deepest secrecy, is now much further advanced. The
negotiations by means of ambassadors have already been commenced; but
the prophet condemns what he can no longer prevent. "Woe to the stubborn
children, saith Jehovah, to drive plans, and not by my impulse, and to
plait alliance, and not according to my Spirit, to heap sin upon sin:
that go away to travel down to Egypt, without having asked my mouth, to
fly to Pharaoh's shelter, and to conceal themselves under the shadow of
Egypt. And Pharaoh's shelter becomes a shame to them, and the
concealment under the shadow of Egypt a disgrace. For Judah's princes
have appeared in Zoan, and his ambassadors arrive in Hanes. They will
all have to be ashamed of a people useless to them, that brings no help
and no use, but shame, and also reproach." Sōrerı̄m is followed by
infinitives with Lamed (cf., [Isa
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md); [Isa
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#008).md): who are bent upon it in their
obstinacy. Massēkhâh designates the alliance as a plait (massēkheth).
According to Cappellus and others, it designates it as formed with a
libation (σπονδη, from σπένδεσθαι); but the former is certainly the more
correct view, inasmuch as massēkhâh (from nâsakh, fundere) signifies a
cast, and hence it is more natural here to take nâsakh as equivalent to
sâkhakh, plectere (Jerome: ordiremini telam). The context leaves no
doubt as to the meaning of the adverbial expressions ולא־מנּי and
ולא־רוּחי, viz., without its having proceeded from me, and without my
Spirit being there. "Sin upon sin:" inasmuch as they carry out further
and further to perfect realization the thought which was already a
sinful one in itself. The prophet now follows for himself the
ambassadors, who are already on the road to the country of the Nile
valley. He sees them arrive in Zoan, and watches them as they proceed
thence into Hanes. He foresees and foretells what a disgraceful opening
of their eyes will attend the reward of this untheocratical beginning.
On lâ‛ōz b', see at [Isa 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#031.md) : ‛ōz
is the infinitive constr. of ‛ūz; mâ‛ōz, on the contrary, is a
derivative of ‛âzaz, to be strong. The suffixes of שׂריו (his princes)
and מלאכיו (his ambassadors) are supposed by Hitzig, Ewald, and Knobel,
who take a different view of what is said, to refer to the princes and
ambassadors of Pharaoh. But this is by no means warranted on the ground
that the prophet cannot so immediately transfer to Zoan and Hanes the
ambassadors of Judah, who were still on their journey according to [Isa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002.md). The prophet's vision overleaps
the existing stage of the desire for this alliance; he sees the great
men of his nation already suing for the favour of Egypt, first of all in
Zoan, and then still further in Hanes, and at once foretells the
shameful termination of this self-desecration of the people of Jehovah.
The lxx give for יגיעוּ חנּס, μάτην κοπιάσουσιν, i.e., ייגעוּ סהנּם, and
Knobel approves this reading; but it is a misunderstanding, which only
happens to have fallen out a little better this time than the rendering
ὡς Δαυίδ given for כּדּוּר in [Isa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md). If chinnâm had been the original
reading, it would hardly have entered any one's mind to change it into
chânēs. The latter was the name of a city on an island of the Nile in
Central Egypt, the later Heracleopolis (Eg. Hnēs; Ehnēs), the Anysis of
Herodotus (ii. 137). On Zoan, see at [Isa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md). At that time the Tanitic
dynasty was reigning, the dynasty preceding the Ethiopian. Tanis and
Anysis were the two capitals. הבאישׁ (= היבשׁ =( ה, a metaplastic hiphil
of יבשׁ = בּושׁ, a different word from יבשׁ) is incorrectly pointed for
הבאישׁ, like ריאשׁנה (keri) for ראישׁנה in [Jos
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#010.md). הבאישׁ signifies elsewhere, "to
make stinking" (to calumniate, [Pro
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#005).md), or "to come into ill odour"
([Sa1 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#012).md); here, however, it means
to be put to shame (בּאשׁ = בּושׁ).

[Isaiah 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 30:6</span></span>

The prophet's address is hardly commenced, however, when a heading is
introduced of the very same kind as we have already met with several
times in the cycle of prophecies against the heathen nations. Gesenius,
Hitzig, Umbreit, and Knobel, rid themselves of it by pronouncing it a
gloss founded upon a misunderstanding. But nothing is more genuine in
the whole book of Isaiah than the words massâ' bahămōth negebh . The
heading is emblematical, like the four headings in chapters 21, 22. And
the massâ' embraces [Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md), [Isa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007.md). Then follows the command to
write it on a table by itself. The heading is an integral part of the
smaller whole. Isaiah breaks off his address to communicate an oracle
relating to the Egyptian treaty, which Jehovah has specially commanded
him to hand down to posterity. The same interruption would take place if
we expunged the heading; for in any case it was [Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md), [Isa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007.md) that he was to write upon a
table. This is not an address to the people, but the preliminary text,
the application of which is determined afterwards. The prophet
communicates in the form of a citation what has been revealed to him by
God, and then states what God has commanded him to do with it. We
therefore enclose [Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md), [Isa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007.md) in inverted commas as a
quotation, and render the short passage, which is written in the tone of
chapter 21, as follows: "Oracle concerning the water-oxen of the south:
Through a land of distress and confinement, whence the lioness and lion,
adders and flying dragons; they carry their possessions on the shoulders
of asses' foals, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a nation
that profits nothing. And Egypt, worthlessly and hollowly will they
help; therefore I call this Egypt, Great-mouth that sits still." The
"water-ox of the south" is the Nile-horse; and this is the emblem of
Egypt, the land of the south (in Daniel and Zechariah Babylonia is "the
land of the north"). Bahămōth is the construct of behēmōth (Job 40),
which is a Hebraized from of an Egyptian word, p-ehe-mau (though the
word itself has not yet been met with), i.e., the ox of the water, or
possibly p-ehe-mau-t (with the feminine article at the close, though in
hesmut, another name for a female animal, mut = t. mau signifies "the
mother:" see at [Job 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015).md). The
animal referred to is the hippopotamus, which is called bomarino in
Italian, Arab. the Nile-horse or water-pig. The emblem of Egypt in other
passages of the Old Testament is tannin, the water-snake, or leviathan,
the crocodile. In [Psa 78:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#031.md) this is
called chayyath qâneh, "the beast of the reed," though Hengstenberg
supposes that the Nile-horse is intended there. This cannot be
maintained, however; but in the passage before us this emblem is chosen,
just because the fat, swine-like, fleshy colossus, whose belly nearly
touches the ground as it walks, is a fitting image of Egypt, a land so
boastful and so eager to make itself thick and broad, and yet so slow to
exert itself in the interest of others, and so unwilling to move from
the spot. This is also implied in the name rahabh-hēm-shâb. Rahab is a
name applied to Egypt in other passages also ([Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md); [Psa
87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md); [Psa
89:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#011).md), and that in the senses
attested by the lxx at [Job 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#012.md)
(cf., [Isa 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013).md), viz., κῆτος, a
sea-monster, monstrum marinum. Here the name has the meaning common in
other passages, viz., violence, domineering pride, boasting (ἀλαζονεία,
as one translator renders it). הם is a term of comparison, as in [Gen
14:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#002.md), etc.; the plural refers to the
people called rahabh. Hence the meaning is either, "The bragging people,
they are sit-still;" or, "Boast-house, they are idlers." To this
deceitful land the ambassadors of Judah were going with rich resources
(chăyâlı̄m, opes) on the shoulder of asses' foals, and on the hump
(dabbesheth, from dâbhash, according to Luzzatto related to gâbhash, to
be hilly) of camels, without shrinking from the difficulties and dangers
of the road through the desert, where lions and snakes spring out now
here and now there (מהם, neuter, as in [Zep
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007.md), comp. [Isa
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016.md); see also [Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md); [Num
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006).md). Through this very desert,
through which God had led their fathers when He redeemed them out of the
bondage of Egypt, they were now marching to purchase the friendship of
Egypt, though really, whatever might be the pretext which they offered,
it was only to deceive themselves; for the vainglorious land would never
keep the promises that it made.

[Isaiah 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 30:8</span></span>

So runs the divine oracle to which the following command refers. "Now
go, write it on a table with them, and note it in a book, and let it
stand there fore future days, for ever, to eternity." The suffixes of
kothbâh (write it) and chuqqâh (note it) refer in a neuter sense to [Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md), [Isa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007.md); and the expression "go" is
simply a general summons to proceed to the matter (cf., [Isa
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015).md). Sēpher could be used
interchangeably with lūăch, because a single leaf, the contents of which
were concluded, was called sēpher ([Exo
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014).md). Isaiah was to write the oracle
upon a table, a separate leaf of durable material; and that "with them,"
i.e., so that his countrymen might have it before their eyes (compare
[Isa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md); [Hab
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002).md). It was to be a memorial for
posterity. The reading לעד (Sept., Targ., Syr.) for לעד is appropriate,
though quite unnecessary. The three indications of time form a climax:
for futurity, for the most remote future, for the future without end.

[Isaiah 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 30:9</span></span>

It was necessary that the worthlessness of the help of Egypt should be
placed in this way before the eyes of the people. "For it is a
refractory people, lying children, children who do not like to hear the
instruction of Jehovah, who say to the seers, See not; and to the
prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things! Speak flatteries to us! Get
out of the way, turn aside from the path, remove from our face the Holy
One of Israel." On the expression ‛am merı̄ (a people of stubbornness),
see at [Isa 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#008.md). The vowel-pointing of
כחשׁהים follows the same rule as that of החכם. The prophet traces back
their words to an unvarnished expression of their true meaning, just as
he does in [Isa 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015.md). They forbid the
prophets of Jehovah to prophesy, more especially nekhōchōth, straight or
true things (things not agreeable to their own wishes), but would rather
hear chălâqōth, i.e., smooth, insinuating, and flattering things, and
even mahăthallōth (from hâthal, Talm. tal, ludere), i.e., illusions or
deceits. Their desire was to be entertained and lauded, not repelled and
instructed. The prophets are to adopt another course (מנּי only occurs
here, and that twice, instead of the more usual מנּי = מן, after the
form אלי, עלי), and not trouble them any more with the Holy One of
Israel, whom they (at least Isaiah, who is most fond of calling Jehovah
by this name) have always in their mouths.

[Isaiah 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 30:12</span></span>

Thus do they fall out with Jehovah and the bearers of His word.
"Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye dislike this
word, and put your trust in force and shufflings, and rely upon this;
therefore will this iniquity be to you like a falling breach, bent
forwards in a high-towering wall, which falls to ruin suddenly, very
suddenly. And He smites it to pieces, as a potter's vessel falls to
pieces, when they smash it without sparing, and of which, when it lies
smashed to pieces there, you cannot find a sherd to fetch fire with from
the hearth, or to take water with out of a cistern." The "word" towards
which they cherished me'ōs (read mo'oskhem), was the word of Jehovah
through His prophet, which was directed against their untheocratic
policy of reckoning upon Egypt. Nâlōz, bent out or twisted, is the term
used to denote this very policy, which was ever resorting to bypaths and
secret ways; whilst ‛ōsheq denotes the squeezing out of the money
required to carry on the war of freedom, and to purchase the help of
Egypt (compare [Kg2 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#020).md). The guilt
of Judah is compared to the broken and overhanging part of a high wall
(nibh‛eh, bent forwards; compare (בּעבּע, a term applied to a diseased
swelling). Just as such a broken piece brings down the whole of the
injured wall along with it, so would the sinful conduct of Judah
immediately ruin the whole of its existing constitution. Israel, which
would not recognise itself as the image of Jehovah, even when there was
yet time ([Isa 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016).md), would be like a
vessel smashed into the smallest fragments. It is the captivity which is
here figuratively threatened by the prophet; for the smashing had regard
to Israel as a state. The subject to וּשׁברהּ in [Isa
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014.md) is Jehovah, who would make use
of the hostile power of man to destroy the wall, and break up the
kingdom of Judah into such a diaspora of broken sherds. The reading is
not ושׁהברהּ (lxx, Targum), but וּשׁברהּ, et franget eam. Kâthōth is an
infinitive statement of the mode; the participle kâthūth, which is
adopted by the Targum, Kimchi, Norzi, and others, is less suitable. It
was necessary to proceed with יחמל לא (without his sparing), simply
because the infinitive absolute cannot be connected with לא (Ewald, 350,
a). לחשּׂוף (to be written thus with dagesh both here and [Hag
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016).md) passes from the primary meaning
nudare to that of scooping up, as ערה does to that of pouring out.

[Isaiah 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 30:15</span></span>

Into such small sherds, a heap thus scattered hither and thither, would
the kingdom of Judah be broken up, in consequence of its ungodly thirst
for self-liberation. "For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of
Israel, Through turning and rest ye would be helped; your strength would
show itself in quietness and confidence; but ye would not. And ye said,
No, but we will fly upon horses; therefore ye shall flee: and, We will
ride upon racehorses; therefore your pursuers will race. A thousand, ye
will flee from the threatening of one, from the threatening of five,
until ye are reduced to a remnant, like a pine upon the top of the
mountain, and like a banner upon the hill." The conditions upon which
their salvation depended, and by complying with which they would attain
to it, were shūbhâh, turning from their self-chosen way, and nachath,
rest from self-confident work of their own (from nūăch, like rachath,
ventilabrum, from rūăch, and shachath, fovea, from shūăch). Their
strength (i.e., what they would be able to do in opposition to the
imperial power) would show itself (hâyâh, arise, come to the light, as
in [Isa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002).md), in hashqēt, laying
aside their busy care and stormy eagerness, and bitchâh, trust, which
cleaves to Jehovah and, renouncing all self-help, leaves Him to act
alone. This was the leading and fundamental principle of the prophet's
politics even in the time of Ahaz ([Isa
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004).md). But from the very first they
would not act upon it; nor would they now that the alliance with Egypt
had become an irreversible fact. To fly upon horses, and ride away upon
racehorses (kal, like κέλης, celer)

(Note: We regard the Sanscrit kal, to drive or hunt, the Greek
κέλλ(ὀκέλλ)ειν, and the Semitic qal, as all having the same root: cf.,
Vurtius, Grundzge der griech. Etymol. i. 116.))

had been and still was their proud and carnal ambition, which Jehovah
would answer by fulfilling upon them the curses of the thorah ([Lev
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#008.md), [Lev
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036.md); [Deu
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025.md); [Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030).md). One, or at the most five, of
the enemy would be able with their snorting to put to flight a whole
thousand of the men of Judah. The verb nūs ([Isa
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#016).md), which rhymes with sūs, is used
first of all in its primary sense of "flying" (related to nūts, cf.,
[Exo 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#027).md), and then in its more
usual sense of "fleeing." (Luzzatto, after Abulwald: vogliamo far sui
cavalli gloriosa comparsa, from nūs, or rather nâsas, hence nânōs, from
which comes nēs, excellere.) יקּלּוּ, the fut. niphal, signifies to be
light, i.e., swift; whereas יקל, the fut. kal, had become a common
expression for light in the sense of despised or lightly esteemed. The
horses and chariots are Judah's own ([Isa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007.md); [Mic
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009).md), though possibly with the
additional allusion to the Egyptian cavalry, of world-wide renown, which
they had called to their help. In [Isa
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#017.md) the subject of the first clause
is also that of the second, and consequently we have not וּמפּני
(compare the asyndeta in [Isa 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006).md).
The insertion of rebhâbhâh (ten thousand) after chămisshâh (five), which
Lowth, Gesenius, and others propose, is quite unnecessary. The play upon
the words symbolizes the divine law of retribution (talio), which would
be carried out with regard to them. The nation, which had hitherto
resembled a thick forest, would become like a lofty pine (tōrne,
according to the talmudic tūrnı̄thâ, Pinus pinea), standing solitary upon
the top of a mountain, and like a flagstaff planted upon a hill - a
miserable remnant in the broad land so fearfully devastated by war. For
אם עד followed by a preterite (equivalent to the fut. exactum), compare
[Isa 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#011.md) and [Gen
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#019.md).

[Isaiah 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 30:18</span></span>

The prophet now proceeds with ולכן, to which we cannot give any other
meaning than et propterea, which it has everywhere else. The thought of
the prophet is the perpetually recurring one, that Israel would have to
be reduced to a small remnant before Jehovah would cease from His wrath.
"And therefore will Jehovah wait till He inclines towards you, and
therefore will He withdraw Himself on high till He has mercy upon you;
for Jehovah is a God of right, salvation to those who wait for Him." In
other places lâkhēn (therefore) deduces the punishment from the sin;
here it infers, from the nature of the punishment, the long continuance
of the divine wrath. Chikkâh, to wait, connected as it is here with
Lamed, has at least the idea, if not the actual signification, of delay
(as in [Kg2 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#003.md); compare [Job
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#004).md). This helps to determine the
sense of yârūm, which does not mean, He will show Himself exalted as a
judge, that through judgment He may render it possible to have mercy
upon you (which is too far-fetched a meaning); but, He will raise
Himself up, so as to be far away (cf., [Num
16:45](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#045.md), "Get you up from among this
congregation;" and [Psa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#005.md), mârōm =
"far above," as far as heaven, out of his sight), that thus (after
having for a long time withdrawn His gracious presence; cf., [Hos
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006).md) He may bestow His mercy upon you.
A dark prospect, but only alarming to unbelievers. The salvation at the
remotest end of the future belongs to believers even now. This is
affirmed in the word 'ashrē (blessed), which recalls [Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md). The prophet uses châkhâh in a
very significant double sense here, just as he did nuus a short time
before. Jehovah is waiting for the time when He can show His favour once
more, and blessed are they who meet His waiting with their own waiting.

[Isaiah 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 30:19</span></span>

None but such are heirs of the grace that follows the judgment - a
people, newly pardoned in response to its cry for help, conducted by
faithful teachers in the right way, and renouncing idolatry with
disgust. "For a people continues dwelling in Zion, in Jerusalem; thou
shalt not weep for ever: He will prove Himself gracious to thee at the
sound of thy cry for help; as soon as He hears, He answers thee. And the
Lord giveth you bread in penury, and water for your need; and thy
teachers will not hide themselves any more, and thine eyes come to see
thy teachers. And thine ears will hear words behind thee, saying, 'This
is the way, walk ye in it!' whether ye turn to the right hand or to the
left. And ye defile the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the
clothing of thy molten images of gold; thou wilt scatter them like
filthy thing: 'Get out!' thou sayest to it." We do not render [Isa
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019.md), "For O people that dwelleth in
Zion, in Jerusalem!" For although the personal pronoun may be omitted
after Vav in an apostrophizing connection ([Pro
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#005.md); [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023).md), we should certainly expect to
find אתּה here. The accent very properly marks these words as forming an
independent clause. The apparent tautology in the expression, "in Zion,
in Jerusalem," is emphatic and explanatory. The fate of Zion-Jerusalem
will not be the same as that of the imperial city ([Isa
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md); [Isa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002).md); for it is the city of Jehovah,
which, according to His promise, cannot become an eternally deserted
ruin. After this promising declaration, the prophet turns and addresses
the people of the future in the people of his own time; bâkhō
strengthens the verbal notion with the mark of duration; chânōn with the
mark of certainty and fulness. יחנך, with an advanced ŏ, as in [Gen
43:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#029.md), for יחן. כּ is the shortest
expression used to denote simultaneous occurrence; answering and hearing
would coincide (shom‛âh, nomen actionis, as in [Isa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009.md); [Isa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md); Ges. 45, 1b; ‛ânâkh, the pausal
form here, as in [Jer 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#037).md). From
this lowest stage of response to the penitential cry for help, the
promise rises higher and higher. The next stage is that in which
Jerusalem is brought into all the distress consequent upon a siege, as
threatened by the prophet in [Isa
29:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md); the besieged would not be
allowed by God to die of starvation, but He would send them the
necessary support. The same expression, but very little altered, viz.,
"to give to eat lechem lachatz ūmayim lachatz," signifies to put any one
upon the low rations of a siege or of imprisonment, in [Kg1
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027.md) and [Ch2
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#026.md); but here it is a promise, with
the threat kept in the background. צר and לחץ are connected with the
absolute nouns לחם and מים, not as adverbial, but as appositional
definitions (like תּרעלה יין, "wine which is giddiness," in [Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005.md); and בּרכּים מים, "water which is
knees," i.e., which has the measure of the knees, where birkayim is also
in apposition, and not the accusative of measurement): literally, bread
which is necessity, and water which is affliction; that is to say,
nourishment of which there is extreme need, the very opposite of bread
and water in abundance. Umbreit and Drechsler understand this
spiritually. But the promise rises as it goes on. There is already an
advance, in the fact that the faithful and well-meaning teachers (mōrı̄m)
no longer keep themselves hidden because of the hard-heartedness and
hatred of the people, as they have done ever since the time of Ahaz
(נכנף, a denom.: to withdraw into כּנף, πτέρυξ, the utmost end, the most
secret corner; though kânaph in itself signifies to cover or conceal).
Israel, when penitent, would once more be able to rejoice in the sight
of those whom it longed to have back again. מוריך is a plural, according
to the context (on the singular of the previous predicate, see Ges.
147). As the shepherds of the flock, they would follow the people with
friendly words of admonition, whilst the people would have their ears
open to receive their instruction. תּאמינוּ is here equivalent to
תּימינוּ, תּימינוּ. The abominations of idolatry (which continued even
in the first years of Hezekiah's reign: [Isa
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#007.md); [Mic
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005.md); [Mic
5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#011.md); [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016).md) would now be regarded as
abominations, and put away. Even gold and silver, with which the images
that were either carved or cast in inferior metal were overlaid, would
be made unclean (see 2 Kings 28:8ff.); that is to say, no use would be
made of them. Dâvâh is a shorter expression for kelı̄ dâvâh, the cloth
worn by a woman at the monthly period. On zârâh, to dispense - to which
dâvâh would be inappropriate if understood of the woman herself, as it
is by Luzzatto - compare [Kg2 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006.md).
With זהבך, the plural used in the general address passes over into the
individualizing singular; לו is to be taken as a neuter pointing back to
the plunder of idols.

[Isaiah 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 30:23</span></span>

The promise, after setting forth this act of penitence, rises higher and
higher; it would not stop at bread in time of need. "And He gives rain
to thy seed, with which thou sowest the land; and bread of the produce
of the land, and it is full of sap and fat: in that day your flocks will
feed in roomy pastures. And the oxen and the young asses, which work the
land, salted mash will they eat, which is winnowed with the winnowing
shovel and winnowing fork! And upon every high mountain, and every hill
that rises high, there are springs, brooks in the day of the great
massacre, when the towers fall." The blessing which the prophet depicts
is the reverse of the day of judgment, and stands in the foreground when
the judgment is past. The expression "in that day" fixes, as it were,
the evening of the day of judgment, which is followed by the depicted
morning of blessing. But the great mass of the Jewish nation would be
first of all murdered in war; the towers must fall, i.e., (though
without any figure, and merely as an exemplifying expression) all the
bulwarks of self-confidence, self-help, and pride ([Isa
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#015.md); [Mic
5:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009).md). In the place of the
self-induced calamities of war, there would now come the God-given rich
blessings of peace; and in the place of the proud towers, there would
come fruitful heights abounding with water. The field would be
cultivated again, and produce luxuriant crops of nutritious corn; so
that not only the labour of man, but that of the animals also, would
receive a rich reward. "Rain to thy seed:" this is the early rain
commencing about the middle of October. אשׁר as an accusative, זרע being
construed with a double accusative, as in [Deu
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#009.md). מקניך might be the singular, so
far as the form is concerned (see [Isa
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#030.md); [Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md); [Isa
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011).md); but, according to [Exo
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#003.md), it must be taken as a plural,
like מוריך. The 'ălâphı̄m are the oxen used in ploughing and threshing;
the ‛ăyârı̄m, the asses used for carrying manure, soil, the sheaves, or
the grain. Belı̄l châmı̄ts is a mash (composed of oats, barley, and
vetches, or things of that kind) made more savoury with salt and sour
vegetables;

(Note: Such as Salsola kali, Salsola tragus, Salsola soda, and other
plants of the family of the chenopodiaceae.)

that is to say, a farrago (from bâlal, to mix; Comm. on Job, at [Job
40:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#019).md). According to Wetzstein, it
is ripe barley (unthreshed during the harvest and threshing time, and
the grain itself for the rest of the year) mixed with salt or salt
vegetables. In any case, belı̄l is to be understood as referring to the
grain; this is evident from the relative clause, "which has been
winnowed" (= mezōreh, Ewald, 169, d), or perhaps more correctly, "which
he (one) winnows" (part. kal), the participle standing for the third
person, with the subject contained within itself (Ewald, 200), i.e., not
what was generally given from economy, viz., barley, etc., mixed with
chopped straw (tibn), but pure grain (habb mahd, as they say at the
present day). Rachath is a winnowing shovel, which is still used,
according to Wetzstein, in Merj. Gedur, and Hauran; mizreh, on the other
hand, is the winnowing fork with six prongs. Dainty food, such as was
only given occasionally to the cattle, as something especially
strengthening, would then be their regular food, and would be prepared
in the most careful manner. "Who cannot see," exclaims Vitringa, "that
this is to be taken spiritually?" He appeals to what Paul says in [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md), viz., that God does not trouble
Himself about oxen. But Paul did not mean this in the same sense as
Aristotle, who maintained that the minima were entirely excluded from
the providence of God. What the Scriptures say concerning cattle, they
do not say for the sake of the cattle, but for the sake of men; though
it does not follow that the cattle are to be understood figuratively, as
representing men. And this is the case here. What the prophet paints in
this idyllic style, in colours furnished by the existing customs,

(Note: Asses particularly, even those of a guest, are generally very
much neglected. The host throws them a little grass, and then hangs up
the fodder-sack full of chopped straw; and it is a sign of extraordinary
hospitality of corn is given to the asses as well as to the horses. -
Wetzstein.)

is not indeed intended to be understood in the letter; and yet it is to
be taken literally. In the age of glory, even on this side of eternity,
a gigantic stride will be taken forward towards the glorification of
universal nature, and towards the end of all those sighs which are so
discernible now, more especially among domestic animals. The prophecy is
therefore to be interpreted according to [Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md).; from which we may clearly see
that God does trouble Himself about the sighing of an ox or ass that is
overburdened with severe toil, and sometimes left to starve.

[Isaiah 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 30:26</span></span>

The promise now rises higher and higher, and passes from earth to
heaven. "And the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and
the light of the sun will be multiplied sevenfold, like the light of
seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth the hurt of His people, and
healeth the crushing of His stroke." Modern commentators from Lowth
downwards for the most part pronounce היּמים שׁבעת כּאור a gloss; and
there is one external evidence in favour of this, which is wanting in
the case of the other supposed glosses in Isaiah, namely, that the words
are omitted by the lxx (though not by the Targum, the Syriac, or
Jerome). Even Luther (although he notices these words in his exposition
and sermons) merely renders them, der Sonnen schein wird siebenmal
heller sein denn jtzt (the sunlight will be seven times as bright as it
is now). But the internal evidence does not favour their spuriousness
even in the case before us; for the fact that the regularity of the
verse, as consisting of four members, is thereby disturbed, is no
evidence at all, since the v. could be warranted in a pentastic quite as
well as in a tetrastic form. We therefore decide in this instance also
in favour of the conclusion that the prophet composed the gloss himself.
But we cannot maintain, with Umbreit, that the addition was necessary,
in order to guard against the idea that there would be seven suns
shining in the sky; for the prophet does not predict a multiplication of
the sun by seven, but simply the multiplication of its light. The seven
days are the length of an ordinary week. Drechsler gives it correctly:
"The radiated light, which is sufficient to produce the daylight for a
whole week according to the existing order of things, will then be
concentrated into a single day." Luther renders it in this way, als wenn
sieben tag ynn eynander geschlossen weren (as if seven days were
enclosed in one another). This also is not meant figuratively, any more
than Paul means is figuratively, when he says, that with the
manifestation of the "glory" of the children of God, the "corruption" of
universal nature will come to an end. Nevertheless, it is not of the new
heaven that the prophet is speaking, but of the glorification of nature,
which is promised by both the Old Testament prophecy and by that of the
New at the closing period of the world's history, and which will be the
closing typical self-annunciation of that eternal glory in which
everything will be swallowed up. The brightest, sunniest days then
alternate, as the prophet foretells, with the most brilliant moonlight
nights. No other miracles will be needed for this than that
wonder-working power of God, which even now produces those changes of
weather, the laws of which no researches of natural science have enabled
us to calculate, and which will then give the greatest brilliancy and
most unchangeable duration to what is now comparatively rare - namely, a
perfectly unclouded sky, with sun or moon shining in all its brilliancy,
yet without any scorching from the one, or injurious effects from the
other. Heaven and earth will then put on their sabbath dress; for it
will be the Sabbath of the world's history, the seventh day in the
world's week. The light of the seven days of the world's week will be
all concentrated in the seventh. For the beginning of creation was
light, and its close will be light as well. The darkness all comes
between, simply that it may be overcome. At last will come a bōqer
(morning), after which it will no more be said, "And evening was, and
morning was." The prophet is speaking of the last type of this morning.
What he predicts here precedes what he predicted in [Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md), just as the date of its
composition precedes that of chapters 24-27; for there the imperial city
was Babylon, whereas here the glory of the latter day is still placed
immediately after the fall of Assyria.

[Isaiah 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 30:27</span></span>

"Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning His wrath, and
quantity of smoke: His lips are full of wrathful foam, and His tongue
like devouring fire. And His breath is like an overflowing brook, which
reaches half-way to the neck, to sift nations in the sieve of
nothingness; and a misleading bridle comes to the cheeks of the
nations." Two figures are here melted together - namely, that of a storm
coming up from the farthest horizon, which turns the sky into a sea of
fire, and kindles whatever it strikes, so that there rises up a heavy
burden, or thick mass of smoke (kōbhed massâ'âh, like mas'ēth in [Jdg
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#040.md), cf., [Jdg
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#038.md); on this attributive
combination, burning His wrath (Ewald, 288, c) and a quantity, etc., see
[Isa 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009).md); and that of a man burning
with wrath, whose lips foam, whose tongue moves to and fro like a flame,
and whose breath is a snorting that threatens destruction, which when it
issues from Jehovah swells into a stream, which so far covers a man that
only his neck appears as the visible half. We had the same figure in
[Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md), where Asshur, as it came
upon Judah, was compared to such an almost overwhelming and drowning
flood. Here, again, it refers to Judah, which the wrath of Jehovah had
almost though not entirely destroyed. For the ultimate object of the
advancing name of Jehovah (shēm, name, relating to His judicial coming)
is to sift nations, etc.: lahănâphâh for lehânı̄ph (like lahăzâdâh in
[Dan 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#020).md), to make it more like
nâphâh in sound. The sieve of nothingness is a sieve in which
everything, that does not remain in it as good corn, is given up to
annihilation; שׁוא is want of being, i.e., of life from God, and denotes
the fate that properly belongs to such worthlessness. In the case of
v'resen (and a bridle, etc.) we must either supply in thought לשׂום
(שׂם), or, what is better, take it as a substantive clause: "a
misleading bridle" (or a bridle of misleading, as Bttcher renders it,
math‛eh being the form mashqeh) holds the cheeks of the nations. The
nations are regarded as wild horses, which could not be tamed, but which
were now so firmly bound and controlled by the wrath of God, that they
were driven down into the abyss.

[Isaiah 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 30:29</span></span>

This is the issue of the judgment which begins at the house of God, then
turns against the instrument employed, namely the heathen, and becomes
to the Israel that survives a counterpart of the deliverance from Egypt.
"Your song will then sound as in the night, when the feast is
celebrated; and ye will have joy of heart like those who march with the
playing of flutes, to go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of
Israel." In the word châg (feast), which is generally used with special
reference to the feast of tabernacles, there is here an unmistakeable
allusion to the passover, as we may see from the introduction of "the
night," which evidently means the night before the passover (lēl
shimmurı̄m, [Exo 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#042).md), which was so
far a festal night, that it preceded and introduced the feast of
unleavened bread. The prophet has taken his figure from the first
passover-night in Egypt, when Israel was rejoicing in the deliverance
which it was just about to receive, whilst the destroying angel was
passing through the land. Such would be the song which they would be
able to sing, when Jehovah poured out His judgment upon His people's
enemies outside. The church is shut up in its chamber ([Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020).md), and its joy resembles the
heartfelt joy of those who go on pilgrimage on one of the three great
feasts, or in the procession that carries up the first-fruits to
Jerusalem (Biccurim, iii. 3), going up with the sound of flutes to the
mountain of Jehovah, to appear before Him, the Rock of Israel.

[Isaiah 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 30:30</span></span>

Israel is marching in such a joyful way to a sacred and glorious height,
whilst outside Jehovah is sweeping the world-power entirely away, and
that without any help from Israel. "And Jehovah causes His majestic
voice to be heard, and causes the lowering of His arm to be seen, with
the snorting of wrath and the blazing of devouring fire, the bursting of
a cloud, and pouring of rain and hailstones. For Asshur will be
terrified at the voice of Jehovah, when He smites with the staff. And it
will come to pass, every stroke of the rod of destiny, which Jehovah
causes to fall upon Asshur, is dealt amidst the noise of drums and the
playing of guitars; and in battles of swinging arm He fights it. For a
place for the sacrifice of abominations has long been made ready, even
for the king is it prepared; deep, broad has He made it: its
funeral-pile has fire and wood in abundance; the breath of Jehovah like
a stream of brimstone sets it on fire." The imposing crash (on hōd, see
[Job 39:20](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#020).md) of the cry which Jehovah
causes to be heard is thunder (see [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001).md); for the catastrophe occurs
with a discharge of all the destructive forces of a storm (see [Isa
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006).md). Nephets is the "breaking up" or
"bursting," viz., of a cloud. It is through such wrath-announcing
phenomena of nature that Jehovah manifests the otherwise invisible
letting down of His arm to smite (nachath may possibly not be the
derivative of nūăch, "settling down," but of nâchath, "the coming down,"
as in [Psa 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003.md); just as shebheth in
[Sa2 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#007.md) is not derived from shūbh,
but from shâbhath, to go to ruin). [Isa
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#031), commencing with ki (for.md),
explains the terrible nature of what occurs, from the object at which it
is directed: Asshur is alarmed at the voice of Jehovah, and thoroughly
goes to pieces. We must not render this, as the Targum does, "which
smites with the rod," i.e., which bears itself so haughtily, so
tyrannically (after [Isa 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024).md). The
smiter here is Jehovah (lxx, Vulg., Luther); and basshēbhet yakkeh is
either an attributive clause, or, better still, a circumstantial
determining clause, eo virga percutiente. According to the accents,
vehâyâh in [Isa 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032.md) is introductory:
"And it will come to pass, every stroke of the punishing rod falls
(supply יהיה) with an accompaniment of drums and guitars" (the Beth is
used to denote instrumental accompaniment, as in [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md); [Isa
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#009.md); [Psa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005), etc..md) - namely, on the part of
the people of Jerusalem, who have only to look on and rejoice in the
approaching deliverance. Mūsâdâh with mattēh is a verbal substantive
used as a genitive, "an appointment according to decree" (comp. yâsad in
[Hab 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md), and yâ‛ad in [Mic
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009).md). The fact that drums and guitars
are heard along with every stroke, is explained in [Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032.md): "Jehovah fights against Asshur
with battles of swinging," i.e., not with darts or any other kind of
weapon, but by swinging His arm incessantly, to smite Asshur without its
being able to defend itself (cf., [Isa
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#016).md). Instead of בּהּ, which points
back to Asshur, not to matteh, the keri has בּם, which is not so harsh,
since it is immediately preceded by עליו. This cutting down of the
Assyrians is accounted for in [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033), (ki, for.md), from the fact that
it had long ago been decreed that they should be burned as dead bodies.
'Ethmūl in contrast with mâchâr is the past: it has not happened today,
but yesterday, i.e., as the predestination of God is referred to, "long
ago."

Tophteh is the primary form of tōpheth (from tūph, not in the sense of
the Neo-Persian tâften, Zend. tap, to kindle or burn, from which comes
tafedra, melting; but in the Semitic sense of vomiting or abhorring: see
at [Job 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006).md), the name of the
abominable place where the sacrifices were offered to Moloch in the
valley of Hinnom: a Tophet-like place. The word is variously treated as
both a masculine and feminine, possibly because the place of abominable
sacrifices is described first as bâmâh in [Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md). In the clause הוּכן למּלך
גּם־הוא, the gam, which stands at the head, may be connected with
lammelekh, "also for the king is it prepared" (see at [Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010).md); but in all probability
lammelekh is a play upon lammolekh (e.g., [Lev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#002).md), "even this has been prepared
for the Melekh," viz., the king of Asshur. Because he was to be burned
there, together with his army, Jehovah had made this Tophet-like place
very deep, so that it might have a far-reaching background, and very
broad, so that in this respect also there might be room for many
sacrifices. And their medūrâh, i.e., their pile of wood (as in [Eze
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#009.md), cf., [Eze
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#005.md), from dūr, Talm. dayyēr, to lay
round, to arrange, pile), has abundance of fire and wood (a hendiadys,
like "cloud and smoke" in [Isa 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005).md).
Abundance of fire: for the breath of Jehovah, pouring upon the funeral
pile like a stream of brimstone, sets it on fire. בּ בּער, not to burn
up, but to set on fire. בּהּ points back to tophteh, like the suffix of
medurâthâh.

(Note: So far as the form of the text is concerned, kōl has the
disjunctive yethib before pashta, which occurs eleven times according to
the Masora. Nevertheless the word is logically connected in the closest
manner with what follows (comp. 'ēth tōrath in [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024).md). The âh of mūsâdâh is rafatum
pro mappicato, according to the Masora; in which case the suffix would
refer to Asshur. In the place of הוא גם we also meet with היּא גם, with
this chethib and keri reversed; but the former, according to which הוכן
is equivalent to הוכנה, has many examples to support it in the Masora.
הוכן has kametz in correct MSS in half pause; whereas Kimchi (Michlol,
117b) regards it as a participle.)
