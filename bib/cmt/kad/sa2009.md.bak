David's Kindness towards Mephibosheth - [Sa2
9:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001.md)

When David was exalted to be king over all Israel, he sought to show
compassion to the house of the fallen king, and to repay the love which
his noble-minded friend Jonathan had once sworn to him before the Lord
([Sa1 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#013.md).; comp. [Sa2
23:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#017).md). The account of this forms
the conclusion of, or rather an appendix to, the first section of the
history of his reign, and was intended to show how David was mindful of
the duty of gratitude and loving fidelity, even when he reached the
highest point of his regal authority and glory. The date when this
occurred was about the middle of David's reign, as we may see from the
fact, that Mephibosheth, who was five years old when Saul died ([Sa2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004).md), had a young son at the time
([Sa2 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#012).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 9:1</span></span>

[Sa2 9:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001.md)

When David inquired whether there was any one left of the house of Saul
to whom he could show favour for Jonathan's sake (ישׁ־עוד הכי: is it so
that there is any one? = there is certainly some one left), a servant of
Saul named Ziba was summoned, who told the king that there was a son of
Jonathan living in the house of Machir at Lodebar, and that he was lame
in his feet. אישׁ עוד האפס, "is there no one at all besides?" The ל
before בּית is a roundabout way of expressing the genitive, as in [Sa1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#018.md), etc., and is obviously not to
be altered into מבּית, as Thenius proposes. "The kindness of God" is
love and kindness shown in God, and for God's sake ([Luk
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#036).md). Machir the son of Ammiel was a
rich man, judging from [Sa2 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027.md),
who, after the death of Saul and Jonathan, had received the lame son of
the latter into his house. Lodebar (לודבר, written לאדבר in [Sa2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027.md), but erroneously divided by the
Masoretes into two words in both passages) was a town on the east of
Mahanaim, towards Rabbath Amman, probably the same place as Lidbir ([Jos
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026).md); but it is not further known.

[Sa2 9:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#005.md)

David sent for this son of Jonathan (Mephibosheth: cf. [Sa2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004).md), and not only restored his
father's possessions in land, but took him to his own royal table for
the rest of his life. "Fear not," said David to Mephibosheth, when he
came before him with the deepest obeisance, to take away any anxiety
lest the king should intend to slay the descendants of the fallen king,
according to the custom of eastern usurpers. It is evident from the
words, "I will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father," that the
landed property belonging to Saul had either fallen to David as crown
lands, or had been taken possession of by distant relations after the
death of Saul. "Thou shalt eat bread at my table continually," i.e., eat
at my table all thy life long, or receive thy food from my table.

[Sa2 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#008.md)

Mephibosheth expressed his thanks for this manifestation of favour with
the deepest obeisance, and a confession of his unworthiness of any such
favour. On his comparison of himself to a "dead dog," see at [Sa1
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#015.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 9:9</span></span>

David then summoned Ziba the servant of Saul, told him of the
restoration of Saul's possessions to his son Mephibosheth, and ordered
him, with his sons and servants, to cultivate the land for the son of
his lord. The words, "that thy master's son may have food to eat," are
not at variance with the next clause, "Mephibosheth shall eat bread
alway at my table," as bread is a general expression, including all the
necessaries of life. Although Mephibosheth himself ate daily as a guest
at the king's table, he had to make provision as a royal prince for the
maintenance of his own family and servants, as he had children according
to [Sa2 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#012.md) and [Ch1
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#034.md). Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty
servants ([Sa2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#010).md), with whom he had
probably been living in Gibeah, Saul's native place, and may perhaps
have hitherto farmed Saul's land.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 9:11</span></span>

Ziba promised to obey the king's command. The last clause of this verse
is a circumstantial clause in form, with which the writer passes over to
the conclusion of his account. But the words שׁלחני על שׁלחן, "at my
table," do not tally with this, as they require that the words should be
taken as David's own. This is precluded, however, not only by the
omission of any intimation that David spoke again after Ziba, and
repeated what he had said once already, and that without any occasion
whatever, but also by the form of the sentence, more especially the
participle אכל. There is no other course left, therefore, than to regard
שׁלחני (my table) as written by mistake for דּוד שׁלחן: "but
Mephibosheth ate at David's table as one of the king's sons." The
further notices in [Sa2 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#012.md) and [Sa2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#013.md) follow this in a very simple
manner. בּית מושׁב כּל, "all the dwelling," i.e., all the inhabitants of
Ziba's house, namely his sons and servants, were servants of
Mephibosheth, i.e., worked for him and cultivated his land, whilst he
himself took up his abode at Jerusalem, to eat daily at the king's
table, although he was lamed in both his feet.
