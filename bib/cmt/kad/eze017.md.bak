### [Ezekiel Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 17:0</span></span>

Humiliation and Exaltation of the Davidic Family

The contents of this chapter are introduced as a riddle and a parable,
and are divided into three sections. [Eze
17:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#001.md) contain the parable; [Eze
17:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#011.md), the interpretation and
application of it to King Zedekiah; and [Eze
17:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022.md), the promise of the Messianic
kingdom.

[Ezekiel 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 17:1</span></span>

The Parable

[Eze 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#001.md). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#002.md). Son of
man, give a riddle, and relate a parable to the house of Israel; [Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md). And say, Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, A great eagle, with great wings and long pinions, full of
feathers of variegated colours, came to Lebanon and took the top of the
cedar: [Eze 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#004.md). He plucked off the
topmost of its shoots, and brought it into Canaan's land; in a
merchant-city he set it. [Eze 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#005.md).
And he took of the seed of the land, and put it into seed-land; took it
away to many waters, set it as a willow. [Eze
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#006.md). And it grew, and became an
overhanging vine of low stature, that its branches might turn towards
him, and its roots might be under him; and it became a vine, and
produced shoots, and sent out foliage. [Eze
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#007.md). There was another great eagle
with great wings and many feathers; and, behold, this vine stretched its
roots languishingly towards him, and extended its branches towards him,
that he might water it from the beds of its planting. [Eze
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#008.md). It was planted in a good field
by many waters, to send out roots and bear fruit, to become a glorious
vine. [Eze 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#009.md). Say, Thus saith the
Lord Jehovah, Will it thrive? will they not pull up its roots, and cut
off its fruit, so that it withereth? all the fresh leaves of its
sprouting will wither, and not with strong arm and with much people will
it be possible to raise it up from its roots. [Eze
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#010.md). And, behold, although it is
planted, will it thrive? will it not wither when the east wind touches
it? upon the beds in which it grew it will wither.

The parable (mâshâl, corresponding exactly to the New Testament
παραβολή) is called chīdhâh, a riddle, because of the deeper meaning
lying beneath the parabolic shell. The symbolism of this parable has
been traced by many commentators to Babylonian influences working upon
the prophet's mind; but without any tenable ground. The figure of the
eagle, or bird of prey, applied to a conqueror making a rapid descent
upon a country, has as little in it of a specifically Babylonian
character as the comparison of the royal family to a cedar or a vine.
Not only is Nebuchadnezzar compared to an eagle in [Jer
48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040.md); [Jer
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022.md), as Cyrus is to a bird of prey
in [Isa 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011.md); but even Moses has
described the paternal watchfulness of God over His own people as
bearing them upon eagle's wings ([Exo
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004.md); [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011).md). The cedar of Lebanon and the
vine are genuine Israelitish figures. The great eagle in [Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md) is the great King Nebuchadnezzar
(compare [Eze 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#012).md). The article is
simply used to indicate the species, for which we should use the
indefinite article. In [Eze 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#007.md),
instead of the article, we have אחד in the sense of "another." This
first eagle has large wings and long pinions; he has already flown
victoriously over wide-spread countries. אשׁר־לו , literally, which is
to him the variegated ornament, i.e., which he has as such an ornament.
The feathers of variegated ornamental colours point to the many peoples,
differing in language, manners, and customs, which were united under the
sceptre of Nebuchadnezzar (Hitzig, etc.); not to the wealth and
splendour of the conqueror, as such an allusion is altogether remote
from the tendency of the parable. He came to Lebanon. This is not a
symbol of the Israelitish land, or of the kingdom of Judah; but, as in
[Jer 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023.md), of Jerusalem, or Mount
Zion, with its royal palace so rich in cedar wood (see the comm. on [Hab
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#017.md) and [Zac
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001).md), as being the place where the
cedar was planted (compare the remarks on [Eze
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#012).md). The cedar is the royal house
of David, and the top of it is King Jehoiachin. The word tzammereth is
only met with in Ezekiel, and there only for the top of a cedar (compare
[Eze 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003)..md). The primary meaning is
doubtful. Some derive it from the curly, or, as it were, woolly top of
the older cedars, in which the small twigs that constitute their foliage
are only found at the top of the tree. Others suppose it to be connected
with the Arabic dmr, to conceal, and understand it as an epithet applied
to the foliage, as the veil or covering of the tree. In v. 4, tzammereth
is explained to be ראשׁ רניקותיו, the topmost of its shoots. This the
eagle plucked off and carried אל־ארץ כּנען, an epithet applied to
Babylonia here and in [Eze 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#029.md), as
being a land whose trading spirit had turned it into a Canaan. This is
evident from the parallel עיר רכלים, city of traders, i.e., Babylon
(compare [Eze 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#012).md). The seed of the
land, according to [Eze 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#013.md), is King
Zedekiah, because he was of the land, the native king, in contrast to a
foreign, Babylonian governor.

קח, for לקח, after the analogy of קחם in [Hos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md), and pointed with Kametz to
distinguish it from the imperative. לקח אל is used as in [Num
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#027.md). The ἁπ. λεγ.צפצפה signifies, in
Arabic and the Talmud, the willow, probably so called because it grows
in well-watered places; according to Gesenius, it is derived from צוּף,
to overflow, literally, the inundated tree. This meaning is perfectly
appropriate here. "He set it as a willow" means he treated it as one,
inasmuch as he took it to many waters, set it in a well-watered soil,
i.e., in a suitable place. The cutting grew into an overhanging vine,
i.e., to a vine spreading out its branches in all directions, though not
growing very high, as the following expression שׁפלת קומה more clearly
shows. The object of this growth was, that its branches might turn to
him (the eagle), and its roots might be under him (the eagle). The
suffixes attached to אליו and תּחתּיו refer to נשׁר. This allusion is
required not only by the explanation in [Eze
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#014.md) (? [Eze
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#014.md), [Eze
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015).md), but also by [Eze
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#007.md), where the roots and branches of
the vine stretch to the (other) eagle. In [Eze
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#006.md), what has already been affirmed
concerning the growth is briefly summed up again. The form פּארה is
peculiar to Ezekiel. Isaiah has פּארה sah h = פּארה in Ezekiel 10:33.
The word signifies branch and foliage, or a branch covered with foliage,
as the ornament of a tree. - The other eagle mentioned in [Eze
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#007.md) is the king of Egypt, according
to [Eze 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015.md). He had also large wings
and many feathers, i.e., a widely spread and powerful kingdom; but there
is nothing said about pinions and variegated colours, for Pharaoh had
not spread out his kingdom over many countries and peoples, or
subjugated a variegated medley of peoples and tribes. כּפן, as a verb
ἁπ. λεγ.., signifies to yearn or pine after a thing; in Chaldee, to
hunger. להשׁקות, that he (the eagle-Pharaoh) might give it to drink, or
water it. The words מערגות מטּעהּ are not connected with להשׁקות, but
with שׁלחה and כּנפה, form the beds of its planting, i.e., in which it
was planted; it stretched out roots and branches to the other eagle,
that he might give it to drink. The interpretation is given in [Eze
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015.md). The words להשׁקות אותהּ, which
are added by way of explanation, do not interrupt the train of thought;
nor are they superfluous, as Hitzig supposes, because the vine had water
enough already ([Eze 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#005.md) and [Eze
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#008).md). For this is precisely what the
passage is intended to show, namely, that there was no occasion for this
pining and stretching out of the branches towards the other eagle,
inasmuch as it could thrive very well in the place where it was planted.
The latter is expressly stated once more in [Eze
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#008.md), the meaning of which is
perfectly clear, - namely, that if Zedekiah had remained quiet under
Nebuchadnezzar, as a hanging vine, his government might have continued
and prospered. But, asks Ezekiel in the name of the Lord, will it
prosper? תּצלח is a question, and the third person, neuter gender. This
question is answered in the negative by the following question, which is
introduced with an affirmative הלוא. The subject to ינתּק and יקוסס dna
is not the first eagle (Nebuchadnezzar), but the indefinite "one" (man,
they). In the last clause of v. 9 משׂאות is a substantive formation,
used instead of the simple form of the infinitive, after the form משּׂא
in [Ch2 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007.md), with the termination ות,
borrowed from the verb ה'ל (compare Ewald, 160b and 239a), and the
construction is the same as in [Amo
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010.md) : it will not be to raise up = it
will not be possible to raise it up (compare Ges. 132, 3, Anm. 1). To
raise it up from its root does not mean to tear it up by the root
(Hvernick), but to rear the withered vine from its roots again, to cause
it to sprout again. This rendering of the words corresponds to the
interpretation given in [Eze 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017.md). -
In [Eze 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#010.md) the leading thought is
repeated with emphasis, and rounded off. The east wind is peculiarly
dangerous to plants on account of its dryness (compare [Gen
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#006.md), and Wetstein on [Job
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021) in Delitzsch's Commentary.md); and
it is used very appropriately here, as the Chaldeans came from the east.

Interpretation of the Riddle

[Eze 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#011.md). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#012.md). Say to
the refractory race: Do ye not know what this is? Say, Behold, the king
of Babel came to Jerusalem and took its king and its princes, and
brought them to himself to Babel. [Eze
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013.md). And he took of the royal seed,
and made a covenant with him, and caused him to enter into an oath; and
he took the strong ones of the land: [Eze
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#014.md). That it might be a lowly
kingdom, not to lift itself up, that he might keep his covenant, that it
might stand. [Eze 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015.md). But he
rebelled against him by sending his messengers to Egypt, that it might
give him horses and much people. Will he prosper? will he that hath done
this escape? He has broken the covenant, and should he escape? [Eze
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#016.md). As I live, is the saying of the
Lord Jehovah, surely in the place of the king, who made him king, whose
oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke with him, in Babel he will
die. [Eze 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017.md). And not with great
army and much people will Pharaoh act with him in the war, when they
cast up a rampart and build siege-towers, to cut off many souls. [Eze
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018.md). He has despised an oath to
break the covenant, and, behold, he has given his hand and done all
this; he will not escape. [Eze 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#019.md).
Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, As I live, surely my oath which
he has despised, and my covenant which he has broken, I will give upon
his head. [Eze 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#020.md). I will spread
out my net over him, so that he will be taken in my snare, and will
bring him to Babel, and contend with him there on account of his
treachery which he has been guilty of towards me. [Eze
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#021.md). And all his fugitives in all
his regiments, by the sword will they fall, and those who remain will be
scattered to all winds; and ye shall see that I Jehovah have spoken it.

In [Eze 17:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#012.md) the parable in [Eze
17:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#002.md) is interpreted; and in [Eze
17:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#019.md) the threat contained in the
parable is confirmed and still further expanded. We have an account of
the carrying away of the king, i.e., Jehoiachin, and his princes to
Babel in [Kg2 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#011.md)., [Jer
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md), and [Jer
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002.md). The king's seed (זרע המּלוּכה,
[Eze 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013.md), as in [Jer
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001.md) = זרע המּלך, [Kg1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014).md) is Jehoiachin's uncle
Mattaniah, whom Nebuchadnezzar made king under the name of Zedekiah
([Kg2 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017).md), and from whom he took an
oath of fealty ([Ch2 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013).md). The
strong of the land (אילי = אוּלי, [Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015).md), whom Nebuchadnezzar took
(לקח), i.e., took away to Babel, are not the heads of tribes and
families ([Kg2 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015).md); but the
expression is used in a wide sense for the several classes of men of
wealth, who are grouped together in [Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md) under the one term כּל־גּבּורי ח
(אנשׁי חיל, [Kg2 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016).md), including
masons, smiths, and carpenters ([Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md) and [Kg2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016).md), whereas the heads of tribes
and families are classed with the court officials (סריסים, [Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015)) under the title שׂריה (princes.md)
in [Eze 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#012.md). The design of these
measures was to make a lowly kingdom, which could not raise itself,
i.e., could not revolt, and to deprive the vassal king of the means of
breaking of the covenant. the suffix attached to לעמדהּ is probably to
be taken as referring to ממלכה rather than בּריתי, although both are
admissible, and would yield precisely the same sense, inasmuch as the
stability of the kingdom was dependent upon the stability of the
covenant. But Zedekiah rebelled ([Kg2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020).md). The Egyptian king who was to
give Zedekiah horses and much people, in other words, to come to his
assistance with a powerful army of cavalry and fighting men, was
Hophrah, the Apries of the Greeks, according to [Jer
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md) (see the comm. on [Kg2
24:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#019).md). היצלח points back to תּצלח
in [Eze 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#009.md); but here it is applied
to the rebellious king, and is explained in the clause 'הימּלט וגו. The
answer is given in [Eze 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#016.md) as a
word of God confirmed by a solemn oath: he shall die in Babel, the
capital of the king, who placed him on the throne, and Pharaoh will not
render him any effectual help ([Eze
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017).md). עשׂה אותו, as in [Eze
15:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001.md) :59, to act with him, that is
to say, assist him, come to his help. אותו refers to Zedekiah, not to
Pharaoh, as Ewald assumes in an inexplicable manner. For 'שׁפך סללה ,
compare [Eze 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002.md); and for the fact
itself, [Jer 34:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021.md), and [Jer
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005.md), according to which, although an
Egyptian army came to the rescue of Jerusalem at the time when it was
besieged by the Chaldeans, it was repulsed by the Chaldeans who marched
to meet it, without having rendered any permanent assistance to the
besieged.

In [Eze 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018.md), the main thought that
breach of faith can bring no deliverance is repeated for the sake of
appending the further expansion contained in [Eze
17:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#019.md). נתן ידו, he gave his hand,
i.e., as a pledge of fidelity. The oath which Zedekiah swore to the king
of Babel is designated in [Eze 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#019.md)
as Jehovah's oath (אלתי), and the covenant made with him as Jehovah's
covenant, because the oath had been sworn by Jehovah, and the covenant
of fidelity towards Nebuchadnezzar had thereby been made implicite with
Jehovah Himself; so that the breaking of the oath and covenant became a
breach of faith towards Jehovah. Consequently the very same expressions
are used in [Eze 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#016.md), [Eze
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018.md), and [Eze
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#019.md), to designate this breach of
oath, which are applied in [Eze 16:59](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#059.md)
to the treacherous apostasy of Jerusalem (Israel) from Jehovah, the
covenant God. And the same expressions are used to describe the
punishment as in [Eze 12:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md). נשׁפּט
אתּו is construed with the accusative of the thing respecting which he
was to be judged, as in [Sa1 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#007.md).
Jehovah regards the treacherous revolt from Nebuchadnezzar as treachery
against Himself (מעל); not only because Zedekiah had sworn the oath of
fidelity by Jehovah, but also from the fact that Jehovah had delivered
up His people and kingdom into the power of Nebuchadnezzar, so that
revolt from him really became rebellion against God. את before כּל־מברחו
is nota accus., and is used in the sense of quod adtinet ad, as, for
example, in [Kg2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#005.md). מברחו, his
fugitives, is rendered both by the Chaldee and Syriac "his brave men,"
or "heroes," and is therefore identified with מבחרו (his chosen ones),
which is the reading in some manuscripts. But neither these renderings
nor the parallel passage in [Eze
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#014.md), where סביבותיו apparently
corresponds to it, will warrant our adopting this explanation, or making
any alteration in the text. The Greek versions have πάσας φυγαδείας
αὐτοῦ; Theodoret: ἐν πάσαις ταῖς φυγαδείαις αὐτοῦ; the Vulgate: omnes
profugi ejus; and therefore they all had the reading מברחו, which also
yields a very suitable meaning. The mention of some who remain, and who
are to be scattered toward all the winds, is not at variance with the
statement that all the fugitives in the wings of the army are to fall by
the sword. The latter threat simply declares that no one will escape
death by flight. But there is no necessity to take those who remain as
being simply fighting men; and the word "all" must not be taken too
literally.

[Ezekiel 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 17:22</span></span>

The Planting of the True Twig of the Stem of David

[Eze 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022.md). Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, And I will take from the top of the high cedar, and will set
it; from the topmost of its shoots will I pluck off a tender one, and
will plant it upon a high and exalted mountain. [Eze
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023.md). On the high mountain of Israel
will I plant it, and it will put forth branches, and bear fruit, and
become a splendid cedar, so that all the birds of every plumage will
dwell under it. In the shade of its branches will they dwell. [Eze
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#024.md). And all the trees of the field
will learn that I Jehovah have lowered the lofty tree, lifted up the low
tree, made the green tree wither, and the withered tree become green. I
Jehovah have said it, and have done it. - Although the sprout of David,
whom Nebuchadnezzar had made king, would lose the sovereignty because of
his breach of faith, and bring about the destruction of the kingdom of
Judah, the Lord would not let His kingdom be destroyed, but would fulfil
the promise which He had given to the seed of David. The announcement of
this fulfilment takes its form from the preceding parable. As
Nebuchadnezzar broke off a twig from the top of the cedar and brought it
to Babel ([Eze 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013).md), so will Jehovah
Himself also pluck off a shoot from the top of the high cedar, and plant
it upon a high mountain. The Vav before לקחתּי is the Vav consec., and
אני is appended to the verb for the sake of emphasis; but in antithesis
to the acting of the eagle, as described in [Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md), it is placed after it. The
cedar, which it designated by the epithet râmâh, as rising above the
other trees, is the royal house of David, and the tender shoot which
Jehovah breaks off and plants is not the Messianic kingdom or
sovereignty, so that Zerubbabel could be included, but the Messiah
Himself as "a distinct historical personage" (Hvernick). The predicate
רך, tender, refers to Him; also the word יונק, a sprout ([Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002).md), which indicates not so much the
youthful age of the Messiah (Hitzig) as the lowliness of His origin
(compare [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md); [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002).md); and even when applied to David
and Solomon, in [Sa2 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#039.md); [Ch1
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#005.md); [Ch1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001.md), expresses not their
youthfulness, but their want of strength for the proper administration
of such a government. The high mountain, described in [Eze
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023.md) as the high mountain of Israel,
is Zion, regarded as the seat and centre of the kingdom of God, which is
to be exalted by the Messiah above all the mountains of the earth ([Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002), etc..md). The twig planted by the
Lord will grow there into a glorious cedar, under which all birds will
dwell. The Messiah grows into a cedar in the kingdom founded by Him, in
which all the inhabitants of the earth will find both food (from the
fruits of the tree) and protection (under its shadow). For this figure,
compare [Dan 4:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#008.md). צפּור כּל־כּנף,
birds of every kind of plumage (cf. [Eze
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#004.md), [Eze
39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017).md), is derived from [Gen
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#014.md), where birds of every kind find
shelter in Noah's ark. The allusion is to men from every kind of people
and tribe. By this will all the trees of the field learn that God lowers
the lofty and lifts up the lowly. As the cedar represents the royal
house of David, the trees of the field can only be the other kings or
royal families of the earth, not the nations outside the limits of the
covenant. At the same time, the nations are not to be entirely excluded
because the figure of the cedars embraces the idea of the kingdom, so
that the trees of the field denote the kingdoms of the earth together
with their kings. The clauses, "I bring down the high tree," contain a
purely general thought, as in [Sa1
2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#007.md), and the perfects are not to be
taken as preterites, but as statements of practical truths. It is true
that the thought of the royal house of David in its previous greatness
naturally suggests itself in connection with the high and green tree,
and that of Jehoiachin in connection with the dry tree (compare [Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030).md); and these are not to be
absolutely set aside. At the same time, the omission of the article from
עץ and the objects which follow, is sufficient to show that the words
are not to be restricted to these particular persons, but are applicable
to every high and green, or withered and lowly tree; i.e., not merely to
kings alone, but to all men in common, and furnish a parallel to [Sa1
2:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#004.md), "The bows of the mighty men are
broken; and they that stumbled are girded with strength," etc.
