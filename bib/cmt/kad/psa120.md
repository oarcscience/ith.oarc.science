Cry of Distress When Surrounded by Contentious Men

This first song of degrees attaches itself to [Psa
119:176](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#176). The writer of Ps 119,
surrounded on all sides by apostasy and persecution, compares himself to
a sheep that is easily lost, which the shepherd has to seek and bring
home if it is not to perish; and the writer of [Psa
120:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001) is also "as a sheep in the
midst of wolves." The period at which he lived is uncertain, and it is
consequently also uncertain whether he had to endure such endless
malignant attacks from foreign barbarians or from his own worldly-minded
fellow-countrymen. E. Tilling has sought to establish a third possible
occasion in his Disquisitio de ratione inscript. XV Pss. grad. (1765).
He derives this and the following songs of degrees from the time
immediately succeeding the Return from the Exile, when the secret and
open hostility of the Samaritans and other neighbouring peoples ([Neh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010), [Neh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019); [Neh
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#017), [Neh
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001)) sought to keep down the rise of
the young colony.

[Psalms 120:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 120:1</span></span>

According to the pointing ויּענני, the poet appears to base his present
petition, which from [Psa 120:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002)
onwards is the substance of the whole Psalm, upon the fact of a previous
answering of his prayers. For the petition in [Psa
120:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002) manifestly arises out of his
deplorable situation, which is described in [Psa
120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005). Nevertheless there are also
other instances in which ויענני might have been expected, where the
pointing is ויּענני ([Psa 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005); [Jon
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#003)), so that consequently ויּענני
may, without any prejudice to the pointing, be taken as a believing
expression of the result (cf. the future of the consequence in [Job
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#016)) of the present cry for help.
צרתה, according to the original signification, is a form of the
definition of a state or condition, as in [Psa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003); 44:27; [Psa
63:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#008), [Jon
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#010), [Hos
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007), and בּצּרתה לּי = בּצּר־לּי, [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007), is based upon the customary
expression צר לּי. In [Psa 120:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002)
follows the petition which the poet sends up to Jahve in the certainty
of being answered. רמיּה beside לשׁון, although there is no masc. רמי
(cf. however the Aramaic רמּי, רמּאי), is taken as an adjective after
the form טריּה, עניּה, which it is also perhaps in [Mic
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012). The parallelism would make לשׁון
natural, like לשׁון מרמה in [Psa 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006);
the pointing, which nevertheless disregarded this, will therefore rest
upon tradition. The apostrophe in [Psa
120:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003) is addressed to the crafty
tongue. לשׁון is certainly feminine as a rule; but whilst the tongue as
such is feminine, the לשׁון רמיה of the address, as in [Psa
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006), refers to him who has such a
kind of tongue (cf. Hitzig on [Pro
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#027)), and thereby the לך is
justified; whereas the rendering, "what does it bring to thee, and what
does it profit thee?" or, "of what use to thee and what advancement to
thee is the crafty tongue?" is indeed possible so far as concerns the
syntax (Ges. 147, e), but is unlikely as being ambiguous and confusing
in expression. It is also to be inferred from the correspondence between
מה־יּתּן לך וּמה־יּסיף לך and the formula of an oath כּה יעשׂה־לּך אלהים
לכה יוסיף, [Sa1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#017); [Sa1
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#013); [Sa1
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#022); [Sa2
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#035); [Rut
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#017), that God is to be thought of as
the subject of יתן and יסיף: "what will," or rather, in accordance with
the otherwise precative use of the formula and with the petition that
here precedes: "what shall He (is He to) give to thee (נתן as in [Hos
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#014)), and what shall He add to thee,
thou crafty tongue?" The reciprocal relation of [Psa
120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004) to מה־יתן, and of. [Psa
120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004) with the superadding עם to
מה־יסיף, shows that [Psa 120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004) is not
now a characterizing of the tongue that continues the apostrophe to it,
as Ewald supposes. Consequently [Psa
120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004) gives the answer to [Psa
120:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003) with the twofold punishment
which Jahve will cause the false tongue to feel. The question which the
poet, sure of the answering of his cry for help, puts to the false
tongue is designed to let the person addressed hear by a flight of
sarcasm what he has to expect. The evil tongue is a sharp sword ([Psa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005)), a pointed arrow ([Jer
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007)), and it is like a fire kindled of
hell ([Jam 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006)). The punishment, too,
corresponds to this its nature and conduct ([Psa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004)). The "mighty one" (lxx δυνατός)
is God Himself, as it is observed in B. Erachin 15b with a reference to
[Isa 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013) : "There is none mighty by
the Holy One, blessed is He." He requites the evil tongue like with
like. Arrows and coals ([Psa 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011))
appear also in other instances among His means of punishment. It, which
shot piercing arrows, is pierced by the sharpened arrows of an
irresistibly mighty One; it, which set its neighbour in a fever of
anguish, must endure the lasting, sure, and torturingly consuming heat
of broom-coals. The lxx renders it in a general sense, σὺν τοῖς ἄνθραξι
τοῖς ἐρημικοῖς; Aquila, following Jewish tradition, ἀρκευθίναις; but
רתם, Arabic ratam, ratem, is the broom-shrub (e.g., uncommonly frequent
in the Belkâ).

[Psalms 120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 120:5</span></span>

Since arrows and broom-fire, with which the evil tongue is requited,
even now proceed from the tongue itself, the poet goes on with the deep
heaving אויה (only found here). גּוּר with the accusative of that beside
which one sojourns, as in [Psa 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#005);
[Isa 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014); [Jdg
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#017). The Moschi (משׁך, the name of
which the lxx takes as an appellative in the signification of long
continuance; cf. the reverse instance in [Isa
66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019) lxx) dwelt between the Black and
the Caspian Seas, and it is impossible to dwell among them and the
inhabitants of Kedar (vid., [Psa 83:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#007))
at one and the same time. Accordingly both these names of peoples are to
be understood emblematically, with Saadia, Calvin, Amyraldus, and
others, of homines similes ejusmodi barbaris et truculentis nationibus.

(Note: If the Psalm were a Maccabaean Psalm, one might think משׁך, from
משׁך, σύρειν, alluded to the Syrians or even to the Jewish apostates
with reference to משׁך ערלה, ἐπισπᾶσθαι τὴν ἀκροβυστίαν ([Co1
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#018)).)

Meshech is reckoned to Magog in [Eze
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#002), and the Kedarites are possessed
by the lust of possession ([Gen 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012))
of the bellum omnium contra omnes. These rough and quarrelsome
characters have surrounded the poet (and his fellow-countrymen, with
whom he perhaps comprehends himself) too long already. רבּת, abundantly
(vid., [Psa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010)), appears, more
particularly in [Ch2 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#017)., as a
later prose word. The להּ, which throws the action back upon the
subject, gives a pleasant, lively colouring to the declaration, as in
[Psa 122:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#003); [Psa
123:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#004). He on his part is peace (cf.
[Mic 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005), [Psa
119:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#004); [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003)), inasmuch as the love of peace,
willingness to be at peace, and a desire for peace fill his σου; but if
he only opens his mouth, they are for war, they are abroad intent on
war, their mood and their behaviour become forthwith hostile. Ewald
(362, b) construes it (following Saadia): and I - although I speak
peace; but if כּי (like עד, [Psa
141:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#010)) might even have this position
in the clause, yet וכי cannot. שׁלום is not on any account to be
supplied in thought to אדבּר, as Hitzig suggests (after [Psa
122:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#008); [Psa
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003); [Psa
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020)). With the shrill dissonance of
שׁלום and מלחמה the Psalm closes; and the cry for help with which it
opens hovers over it, earnestly desiring its removal.
