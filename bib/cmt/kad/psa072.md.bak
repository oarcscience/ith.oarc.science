Prayer for the Dominion of Peace of the Anointed One of God

This last Psalm of the primary collection, united to Ps 71 by community
of the prominent word tsdqtk, appears, as we look to the superscription,
[Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020.md), to be said to be a Psalm
of David; so that consequently לשׁלמה designates Solomon as the subject,
not the author. But the Lamed of לשׁלמה here and in [Psa
127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md) cannot have any other meaning
than that which the Lamed always has at the head of the Psalms when it
is joined to proper names; it is then always the expression denoting
that the Psalm belongs to the person named, as its author. Then in style
and general character the Psalm has not the least kinship with the
Psalms of David. Characteristic of Solomon, on the other hand, are the
movement proverb-like, and for the most part distichic, which has less
of original freshness and directness than of an artificial, reflective,
and almost sluggish manner, the geographic range of view, the richness
in figures drawn from nature, and the points of contact with the Book of
Job, which belongs incontrovertibly to the circle of the Salomonic
literature: these are coincident signs which are decisive in favour of
Solomon. But if Solomon is the author, the question arises, who is the
subject of the Psalm? According to Hitzig, Ptolemy Philadelphus; but no
true Israelite could celebrate him in this manner, and there is no
reliable example of carmina of this character having found their way
into the song-book of Israel. The subject of the Psalm is either Solomon
(lxx εἰς Σαλωμών) or the Messiah (Targum, "O God, give Thy regulations
of right to the King Messiah, למלכּא משׁיחא"). Both are correct. It is
Solomon himself to whom the intercession and desires of blessing of this
Psalm refer. Solomon, just as David with [Psa
20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md) and [Psa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md), put it into the heart and mouth
of the people, probably very soon after his accession, it being as it
were a church-prayer on behalf of the new, reigning king. But the Psalm
is also none the less Messianic, and with perfect right the church has
made it the chief Psalm of the festival of Epiphany, which has received
its name of festum trium regum out of it.

Solomon was in truth a righteous, benign, God-fearing ruler; he
established and also extended the kingdom; he ruled over innumerable
people, exalted in wisdom and riches above all the kings of the earth;
his time was the most happy, the richest in peace and joy that Israel
has ever known. The words of the Psalm were all fulfilled in him, even
to the one point of the universal dominion that is wished for him. But
the end of his reign was not like the beginning and the middle of it.
That fair, that glorious, that pure image of the Messiah which he had
represented waxed pale; and with this fading away its development in
relation to the history of redemption took a new turn. In the time of
David and of Solomon the hope of believers, which was attached to the
kingship of David, had not yet fully broken with the present. At that
time, with few exceptions, nothing was known of any other Messiah than
the Anointed One of God, who was David or Solomon himself. When,
however, the kingship in these its two most glorious impersonations had
proved itself unable to bring to full realization the idea of the
Messiah or of the Anointed One of God, and when the line of kings that
followed thoroughly disappointed the hope which clung to the kingship of
the present, - a hope which here and there, as in the reign of Hezekiah,
blazed up for a moment and then totally died out, and men were driven
from the present to look onward into the future, - then, and not until
then, did any decided rupture take place between the Messianic hope and
the present. The image of the Messiah is now painted on the pure
ethereal sky of the future (though of the immediate future) in colours
which were furnished by older unfulfilled prophecies, and by the
contradiction between the existing kingship and its idea; it becomes
more and more, so to speak, an image, super-earthly, super-human,
belonging to the future, the invisible refuge and invisible goal of a
faith despairing of the present, and thereby rendered relatively more
spiritual and heavenly (cf. the Messianic image painted in colours
borrowed from our Psalm in Isa. 11, [Mic
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003.md), [Mic
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006.md); [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009)..md). In order rightly to estimate
this, we must free ourselves from the prejudice that the centre of the
Old Testament proclamation of salvation \[or gospel\] lies in the
prophecy of the Messiah. Is the Messiah, then, anywhere set forth as the
Redeemer of the world? The Redeemer of the world if Jahve. The appearing
(parusia) of Jahve is the centre of the Old Testament proclamation of
salvation. An allegory may serve to illustrate the way in which the Old
Testament proclamation of salvation unfolds itself. The Old Testament in
relation to the Day of the New Testament is Night. In this Night there
rise in opposite directions two stars of Promise. The one describes its
path from above downwards: it is the promise of Jahve who is about to
come. The other describes its path from below upwards: it is the hope
which rests on the seed of David, the prophecy of the Son of David,
which at the outset assumes a thoroughly human, and merely earthly
character. These two stars meet at last, they blend together into one
star; the Night vanishes and it is Day. This one Star is Jesus Christ,
Jahve and the Son of David in one person, the King of Israel and at the
same time the Redeemer of the world, - in one word, the God-man.

[Psalms 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 72:1</span></span>

The name of God, occurring only once, is Elohim; and this is sufficient
to stamp the Psalm as an Elohimic Psalm. מלך (cf. [Psa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002).md) and בּן־מלך are only used
without the article according to a poetical usage of the language. The
petition itself, and even the position of the words, show that the
king's son is present, and that he is king; God is implored to bestow
upon him His משׁפּטים, i.e., the rights or legal powers belonging to
Him, the God of Israel, and צדקה, i.e., the official gift in order that
he may exercise those rights in accordance with divine righteousness.
After the supplicatory teen the futures which now follow, without the
Waw apodoseos, are manifestly optatives. Mountains and hills describe
synecdochically the whole land of which they are the high points visible
afar off. נשׂא is used in the sense of נשׂא פּרי [Eze
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#008.md) : may שׁלום be the fruit which
ripens upon every mountain and hill; universal prosperity satisfied and
contented within itself. The predicate for [Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003.md) is to be taken from [Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003.md), just as, on the other hand,
בּצדקה, "in or by righteousness," the fruit of which is indeed peace
([Isa 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017).md), belongs also to [Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003.md); so that consequently both
members supplement one another. The wish of the poet is this: By
righteousness, may there in due season be such peaceful fruit adorning
all the heights of the land. [Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003.md), however, always makes one feel
as though a verb were wanting, like תּפרחנה suggested by Bttcher. In
[Psa 72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004.md) the wishes are continued in
plain unfigurative language. הושׁיע in the signification to save, to
obtain salvation for, has, as is frequently the case, a dative of the
object. בּני־אביון are those who are born to poverty, just like בּן־מלך,
one who is born a king. Those who are born to poverty are more or less
regarded, by an unrighteous government, as having no rights.

[Psalms 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 72:5</span></span>

The invocation of [Psa 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md) is
continued in the form of a wish: may they fear Thee, Elohim, עם־שׁמשׁ,
with the sun, i.e., during its whole duration (עם in the sense of
contemporary existence, as in Dan. 3:33). לפני־ירח, in the moonlight
(cf. [Job 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#016.md), לפני־שׁמשׁ, in the
sunshine), i.e., so long as the moon shines. דּור דּורים (accusative of
the duration of time, cf. [Psa
102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025).md), into the uttermost generation
which outlasts the other generations (like שׁמי השּׁמים of the furthest
heavens which surround the other heavens). The first two periphrastic
expressions for unlimited time recur in [Psa
89:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037.md)., a Psalm composed after the
time of Solomon; cf. the unfigurative expression in Solomon's prayer at
the dedication of the Temple in [Kg1
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#040.md). The continuance of the kingship,
from the operation of which such continuance of the fear of God is
expected, is not asserted until [Psa
72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017.md). It is capricious to refer the
language of address in [Psa 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md) to
the king (as Hupfeld and Hitzig do), who is not directly addressed
either in [Psa 72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004.md), or in [Psa
72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006.md), or anywhere in the Psalm. With
respect to God the desire is expressed that the righteous and benign
rule of the king may result in the extension of the fear of God from
generation to generation into endless ages. The poet in [Psa
72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006.md) delights in a heaping up of
synonyms in order to give intensity to the expression of the thoughts,
just as in [Psa 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md); the last two
expressions stand side by side one another without any bond of
connection as in [Psa 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md). רביבים
(from רבב, Arab. rbb, densum, spissum esse, and then, starting from this
signification, sometimes multum and sometimes magnum esse) is the shower
of rain pouring down in drops that are close together; nor is זרזיף a
synonym of גּז, but (formed from זרף, Arab. ḏrf, to flow, by means of a
rare reduplication of the first two letters of the root, Ew. 157, d)
properly the water running from a roof (cf. B. Joma 87a: "when the maid
above poured out water, זרזיפי דמיא came upon his head"). גּז, however,
is not the meadow-shearing, equivalent to a shorn, mown meadow, any more
than גּז, גּזּה, Arabic ǵizza, signifies a shorn hide, but, on the
contrary, a hide with the wool or feathers (e.g., ostrich feathers)
still upon it, rather a meadow, i.e., grassy plain, that is intended to
be mown. The closing word ארץ (accus. loci as in [Psa
147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015).md) unites itself with the opening
word ירד: descendat in terram. In his last words (2 Sam. 23) David had
compared the effects of the dominion of his successor, whom he beheld as
by vision, to the fertilizing effects of the sun and of the rain upon
the earth. The idea of [Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006.md) is
that Solomon's rule may prove itself thus beneficial for the country.
The figure of the rain in [Psa 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007.md)
gives birth to another: under his rule may the righteous blossom
(expanding himself unhindered and under the most favourable
circumsntaces), and (may there arise) salvation in all fulness עד־בּלי
ירח, until there is no more moon (cf. the similar expression in [Job
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#012).md). To this desire for the
uninterrupted prosperity and happiness of the righteous under the reign
of this king succeeds the desire for an unlimited extension of his
dominion, [Psa 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md). The sea (the
Mediterranean) and the river (the Euphrates) are geographically defined
points of issue, whence the definition of boundary is extended into the
unbounded. Solomon even at his accession ruled over all kingdoms from
the Euphrates as far as the borders of Egypt; the wishes expressed here
are of wider compass, and Zechariah repeats them predictively ([Psa
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010).md) with reference to the King
Messiah.

[Psalms 72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 72:9</span></span>

This third strophe contains prospects, the ground of which is laid down
in the fourth. The position of the futures here becomes a different one.
The contemplation passes from the home relations of the new government
to its foreign relations, and at the same time the wishes are changed
into hopes. The awe-commanding dominion of the king shall stretch even
into the most distant corners of the desert. ציּים is used both for the
animals and the men who inhabit the desert, to be determined in each
instance by the context; here they are men beyond all dispute, but in
[Psa 74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md); [Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013.md), it is matter of controversy
whether men or beasts are meant. Since the lxx, Aquila, Symmachus, and
Jerome here, and the lxx and Jerome in [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md), render Αἰθίοπες, the nomadic
tribes right and left of the Arabian Gulf seem traditionally to have
been associated in the mind with this word, more particularly the
so-called Ichthyophagi. These shall bend the knee reverentially before
him, and those who contend against him shall be compelled at last to
veil their face before him in the dust. The remotest west and south
become subject and tributary to him, viz., the kings of Tartessus in the
south of Spain, rich in silver, and of the islands of the Mediterranean
and the countries on its coasts, that is to say, the kings of the
Polynesian portion of Europe, and the kings of the Cushitish or of the
Joktanitish שׁבא and of the Cushitish סבא, as, according to Josephus,
the chief city of Meroכ was called (vid., Genesis, S. 206). It was a
queen of that Joktanitish, and therefore South Arabian Sheba, - perhaps,
however, more correctly (vid., Wetzstein in my Isaiah, ii. 529) of the
Cushitish (Nubian) Sheba, - whom the fame of Solomon's wisdom drew
towards him, 1 Kings 10. The idea of their wealth in gold and in other
precious things is associated with both peoples. In the expression השׁיב
מנחה (to pay tribute, [Kg2 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003.md), cf.
[Psa 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004).md) the tribute is not conceived
of as rendered in return for protection afforded (Maurer, Hengstenberg,
and Olshausen), nor as an act repeated periodically (Rdiger, who refers
to [Ch2 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005).md), but as a bringing back,
i.e., repayment of a debt, referre s. reddere debitum (Hupfeld), after
the same idea according to which obligatory incomings are called reditus
(revenues). In the synonymous expression הקריב אשׁכּר the presentation
appears as an act of sacrifice. אשׁכּר signifies in [Eze
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#015.md) a payment made in merchandise,
here a rent or tribute due, from שׂכר, which in blending with the Aleph
prostheticum has passed over into שׂכר by means of a shifting of the
sound after the Arabic manner, just as in אשׁכּל the verb שׂכל, to
interweave, passes over into שׂכל (Rdiger in Gesenius' Thesaurus). In
[Psa 72:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011.md) hope breaks through every
bound: everything shall submit to his world-subduing sceptre.

[Psalms 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 72:12</span></span>

The confirmation of these prospects is now given. Voluntative forms are
intermingled because the prospect extending into the future is
nevertheless more lyrical than prophetic in its character. The elevation
of the king to the dominion of the world is the reward of his
condescension; he shows himself to be the helper and protecting lord of
the poor and the oppressed, who are the especial object upon which God's
eye is set. He looks upon it as his task to deal most sympathizingly and
most considerately (יחס) just with those of reduced circumstances and
with the poor, and their blood is precious in his eyes. [Psa
72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012.md) is re-echoed in [Job
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#012.md). The meaning of [Psa
72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014.md) is the same as [Psa
116:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015.md). Instead of יקר, by a retention
of the Jod of the stem it is written ייקר. Just as in [Psa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010.md), ייקר here also is followed by
ויחי. The assertion is individualized: and he (who was threatened with
death) shall live (voluntative, having reference to the will of the
king). But who is now the subject to ויתּן-? Not the rescued one
(Hitzig), for after the foregoing designations ([Psa
72:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011)..md) we cannot expect to find "the
gold of Sheba" (gold from Jeman or Aethiopia) in his possession.
Therefore it is the king, and in fact Solomon, of whom the disposal of
the gold of Sheba (Saba) is characteristic. The king's thought and
endeavour are directed to this, that the poor man who has almost fallen
a victim shall live or revive, and not only will he maintain his cause,
he will also bestow gifts upon him with a liberal hand, and he (the poor
one who has been rescued and endowed from the riches of the king) shall
pray unceasingly for him (the king) and bless him at all times. The poor
one is he who is restored to life and endowed with gifts, and who
intercedes and blesses; the king, however, is the beneficent giver. It
is left for the reader to supply the right subjects in thought to the
separate verbs. That clearly marked precision which we require in
rhetorical recital is alien to the Oriental style (vid., my Geschichte
der jdischen Poesie, S. 189). Maurer and Hofmann also give the same
interpretation as we have done.

[Psalms 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 72:16</span></span>

Here, where the futures again stand at the head of the clauses, they are
also again to be understood as optatives. As the blessing of such a
dominion after God's heart, not merely fertility but extraordinary
fruitfulness may be confidently desired for the land פּסּה (ἁπ. λεγ..),
rendered by the Syriac version sugo, abundance, is correctly derived by
the Jewish lexicographers from פּסס = פּשׂה (in the law relating to
leprosy), Mishnic פּסה, Aramaic פּסא, Arabic fšâ, but also fšš (vid.,
Job, at [Psa 35:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014).md), to extend,
expandere; so that it signifies an abundance that occupies a broad
space. בּראשׁ, unto the summit, as in [Psa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006.md); [Psa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005.md). The idea thus obtained is the
same as when Hofmann (Weissagung und Erf׬llung, i. 180f.) takes פסּה
(from פּסס = אפס) in the signification of a boundary line: "close upon
the summit of the mountain shall the last corn stand," with reference to
the terrace-like structure of the heights. פּריו does not refer back to
בארץ (Hitzig, who misleads one by referring to [Joe
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#003).md), but to בּר: may the corn stand
so high and thick that the fields, being moved by the wind, shall shake,
i.e., wave up and down, like the lofty thick forest of Lebanon. The lxx,
which renders huperarthee'setai, takes ירעשׁ for יראשׁ, as Ewald does:
may its fruit rise to a summit, i.e., rise high, like Lebanon. But a
verb ראשׁ is unknown; and how bombastic is this figure in comparison
with that grand, but beautiful figure, which we would not willingly
exchange even for the conjecture יעשׁר (may it be rich)! The other wish
refers to a rapid, joyful increase of the population: may men blossom
out of this city and out of that city as the herb of the earth (cf. [Job
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#025.md), where צאצאיך also accords in
sound with יציצוּ), i.e., fresh, beautiful, and abundant as it. Israel
actually became under Solomon's sceptre as numerous "as the sand by the
sea" ([Kg1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020).md), but increase of
population is also a settled feature in the picture of the Messianic
time ([Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md), [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md); [Isa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020.md), [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008) \[4\]; cf. Sir. 44:21.md). If,
however, under the just and benign rule of the king, both land and
people are thus blessed, eternal duration may be desired for his name.
May this name, is the wish of the poet, ever send forth new shoots (ינין
Chethib), or receive new shoots (ינּון Ker, from Niph. ננון), as long as
the sun turns its face towards us, inasmuch as the happy and blessed
results of the dominion of the king ever afford new occasion for
glorifying his name. May they bless themselves in him, may all nations
call him blessed, and that, as ויתבּרכוּ בו

(Note: Pronounce wejithbārchu, because the tone rests on the first
letter of the root; whereas in [Psa
72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015.md) it is jebārachenu with Chateph.
vid., the rule in the Luther. Zeitschrift, 1863, S. 412.)

implies, so blessed that his abundance of blessing appears to them to be
the highest that they can desire for themselves. To et benedicant sibi
in eo we have to supply in thought the most universal, as yet undefined
subject, which is then more exactly defined as omnes gentes with the
second synonymous predicate. The accentuation (Athnach, Mugrash, Silluk)
is blameless.

[Psalms 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 72:18</span></span>

Closing Beracha of the Second Book of the Psalter. It is more full-toned
than that of the First Book, and God is intentionally here called Jahve
Elohim the God of Israel because the Second Book contains none but
Elohim-Psalms, and not, as there, Jahve the God of Israel. "Who alone
doeth wonders" is a customary praise of God, [Psa
86:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#010.md); [Psa
136:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#004.md), cf. [Job
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008.md). שׁם כּבודו is a favourite word in
the language of divine worship in the period after the Exile ([Neh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005).md); it is equivalent to the שׁם
כּבוד מלכוּתו in the liturgical Beracha, God's glorious name, the name
that bears the impress of His glory. The closing words: and let the
whole earth be full, etc., are taken from [Num
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021.md). Here, as there, the
construction of the active with a double accusative of that which fills
and that which is to be filled is retained in connection with the
passive; for כבודו is also accusative: let be filled with His glory the
whole earth (let one make it full of it). The אמן coupled by means of
Waw is, in the Old Testament, exclusively peculiar to these doxologies
of the Psalter.

[Psalms 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 72:20</span></span>

Superscription of the primary collection. The origin of this
superscription cannot be the same as that of the doxology, which is only
inserted between it and the Psalm, because it was intended to be read
with the Psalm at the reading in the course of the service (Symbolae, p.
19). כּלוּ = כּלּוּ, like דּחוּ in Ps 36:13, כּסּוּ, [Psa
80:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#011.md), all being Pual forms, as is
manifest in the accented ultima. A parallel with this verse is the
superscription "are ended the words of Job" in [Job
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#040.md), which separates the
controversial speeches and Job's monologue from the speeches of God. No
one taking a survey of the whole Psalter, with the many Psalms of David
that follow beyond Ps 72, could possibly have placed this key-stone
here. If, however, it is more ancient than the doxological division into
five books, it is a significant indication in relation to the history of
the rise of the collection. It proves that the collection of the whole
as it now lies before us was at least preceded by one smaller
collection, of which we may say that it extended to Ps 72, without
thereby meaning to maintain that it contained all the Psalms up to that
one, since several of them may have been inserted into it when the
redaction of the whole took place. But it is possible for it to have
contained Ps 72, wince at the earliest it was only compiled in the time
of Solomon. The fact that the superscription following directly upon a
Psalm of Solomon is thus worded, is based on the same ground as the fact
that the whole Psalter is quoted in the New Testament as Davidic. David
is the father of the שׁיר ה, [Ch2
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#027.md), and hence all Psalms may be
called Davidic, just as all משׁלים may be called Salomonic, without
meaning thereby that they are all composed by David himself.
