### [Psalms Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 15:0</span></span>

The Conditions of Access to God

The preceding Psalm distinguished דור צדיק, a righteous generation, from
the mass of the universal corruption, and closed with a longing for the
salvation out of Zion. [Psa 15:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md)
answers the question: who belongs to this דור צדיק, and whom shall the
future salvation avail? [Psa 24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md),
composed in connection with the removal of the Ark to Zion, is very
similar. The state of mind expressed in this Psalm exactly corresponds
to the unhypocritical piety and genuine lowliness which were manifest in
David in their most beauteous light on that occasion; cf. [Psa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md) with [Sa2
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019.md); [Psa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md) with [Sa2
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#021.md). The fact, however, that Zion
(Moriah) is called simply הר הקּדשׁ in [Psa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md), rather favours the time of the
Absolomic exile, when David was cut off from the sanctuary of his God,
whilst it was in the possession of men the very opposite of those
described in this Psalm (vid., [Psa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006).md). Nothing can be maintained with
any certainty except that the Psalm assumes the elevation of Zion to the
special designation of "the holy mountain" and the removal of the Ark to
the אהל erected there ([Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017).md).
[Isa 33:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013.md) is a fine variation of
this Psalm.

[Psalms 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 15:1</span></span>

That which is expanded in the tristichic portion of the Psalm, is all
contained in this distichic portion in nuce. The address to God is not
merely a favourite form (Hupfeld), but the question is really, as its
words imply, directed to God. The answer, however, is not therefore to
be taken as a direct answer from God, as it might be in a prophetical
connection: the psalmist addresses himself to God in prayer, he as it
were reads the heart of God, and answers to himself the question just
asked, in accordance with the mind of God. גּוּר and שׁכן which are
usually distinguished from each other like παροικεῖν and κατοικεῖν in
Hellenistic Greek, are alike in meaning in this instance. It is not a
merely temporary גּוּר ([Psa 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005).md),
but for ever, that is intended. The only difference between the two
interchangeable notions is this, the one denotes the finding of an
abiding place of rest starting from the idea of a wandering life, the
other the possession of an abiding place of rest starting from the idea
of settled family life.

(Note: In the Arabic jâm ‛lllh is "one under the protection of God,
dwelling as it were in the fortress of God" vid., Fleischer's
Samachschari, S. 1, Anm. 1.)

The holy tabernacle and the holy mountain are here thought of in their
spiritual character as the places of the divine presence and of the
church of God assembled round the symbol of it; and accordingly the
sojourning and dwelling there is not to be understood literally, but in
a spiritual sense. This spiritual depth of view, first of all with local
limitations, is also to be found in [Psa
27:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md); [Psa
61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005.md). This is present even where the
idea of earnestness and regularity in attending the sanctuary rises in
intensity to that of constantly dwelling therein, [Psa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005.md); [Psa
84:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md); while elsewhere, as in [Psa
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md), the outward materiality of the
Old Testament is not exceeded. Thus we see the idea of the sanctuary at
one time contracting itself within the Old Testament limits, and at
another expanding more in accordance with the spirit of the New
Testament; since in this matter, as in the matter of sacrifice, the
spirit of the New Testament already shows signs of life, and works
powerfully through its cosmical veil, without that veil being as yet
rent. The answer to the question, so like the spirit of the New
Testament in its intention, is also itself no less New Testament in its
character: Not every one who saith Lord, Lord, but they who do the will
of God, shall enjoy the rights of friendship with Him. But His will
concerns the very substance of the Law, viz., our duties towards all
men, and the inward state of the heart towards God.

In the expression הולך תמים (here and in [Pro
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#018).md), תמים is either a closer
definition of the subject: one walking as an upright man, like הולך רכיל
one going about as a slanderer, cf. היּשׂר הולך [Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007.md) "the upright as one walking;" or
it is an accusative of the object, as in הולך צדקות [Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md) : one who walks uprightness,
i.e., one who makes uprightness his way, his mode of action; since תמים
may mean integrum = integritas, and this is strongly favoured by הלכים
בּתמים, which is used interchangeably with it in [Psa
84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012) (those who walk in uprightness.md).
Instead of עשׂה צדקה we have the poetical form of expression פּעל צדק.
The characterising of the outward walk and action is followed in [Psa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002.md) by the characterising of the
inward nature: speaking truth in his heart, not: with his heart (not
merely with his mouth); for in the phrase אמר בּלב, בּ is always the
Beth of the place, not of the instrument-the meaning therefore is: it is
not falsehood and deceit that he thinks and plans inwardly, but truth
(Hitz.). We have three characteristics here: a spotless walk, conduct
ordered according to God's will, and a truth-loving mode of thought.

[Psalms 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 15:3</span></span>

The distich which contains the question and that containing the general
answer are now followed by three tristichs, which work the answer out in
detail. The description is continued in independent clauses, which,
however, have logically the value of relative clauses. The perff. have
the signification of abstract presents, for they are the expression of
tried qualities, of the habitual mode of action, of that which the man,
who is the subject of the question, never did and what consequently it
is not his wont to do. רגל means to go about, whether in order to spie
out (which is its usual meaning), or to gossip and slander (here, and
the Piel in [Sa2 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#028.md); cf. רכל,
רכיל). Instead בּלשׁנו we have על־לּשׁנו (with Dag. in the second ל, in
order that it may be read with emphasis and not slurred over),

(Note: Vid., the rule for this orthophonic Dag. in the Luther.
Zeitschrift, 1863, S. 413.)

because a word lies upon the tongue ere it is uttered, the speaker
brings it up as it were from within on to his tongue or lips, [Psa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md); [Psa
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016.md); [Eze
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003.md). The assonance of לרעהוּ רעה is
well conceived. To do evil to him who is bound to us by the ties of
kindred and friendship, is a sin which will bring its own punishment.
קרוב is also the parallel word to רע in [Exo
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027.md). Both are here intended to refer
not merely to persons of the same nation; for whatever is sinful in
itself and under any circumstances whatever, is also sinful in relation
to every man according to the morality of the Old Testament. The
assertion of Hupfeld and others that נשׂא in conjunction with חרפּה
means efferre = effari, is opposed by its combination with על and its
use elsewhere in the phrase נשׁא חרפה "to bear reproach" ([Psa
69:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008).md). It means (since נשׁא is just as
much tollere as ferre) to bring reproach on any one, or load any one
with reproach. Reproach is a burden which is more easily put on than
cast off; audacter calumniare, semper aliquid haeret.

In [Psa 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md) the interpretation "he is
little in his own eyes, despised," of which Hupfeld, rejecting it, says
that Hitzig has picked it up out of the dust, is to be retained. Even
the Targ., Saad., Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, Urbino (in his Grammar, אהל מועד)
take נבזה בעיניו together, even though explaining it differently, and it
is accordingly accented by Baer נמאס

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

נבזה בּע יניו (Mahpach, Asla Legarme, Rebia magnum).

(Note: The usual accentuation בּעיניו נמאס

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

נבזה forcibly separates בעיניו from נבזה to which according to its
position it belongs. And Heidenheim's accentuation נבזה בעיניו נמאס is
to be rejected on accentuological grounds, because of two like
distinctives the second has always a less distinctive value than the
first. We are consequently only left to the one given above. The MSS
vary.)

God exalts him who is קטן בּעיניו, [Sa1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#017.md). David, when he brought up the
ark of his God, could not sufficiently degrade himself (נקל), and
appeared שׁפל בּעניו, [Sa2 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#022.md). This
lowliness, which David also confesses in [Psa
131:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md), is noted here and throughout
the whole of the Old Testament, e.g., [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md), as a condition of being
well-pleasing before God; just as it is in reality the chief of all
virtues. On the other hand, it is mostly translated either, according to
the usual accentuation, with which the Beth of בעיניו is dageshed: the
reprobate is despised in his eyes (Rashi, Hupf.), or in accordance with
the above accentuation: despised in his eyes is the reprobate (Maurer,
Hengst., Olsh., Luzzatto); but this would say but little, and be badly
expressed. For the placing together of two participles without an
article, and moreover of similar meaning, with the design of the one
being taken as subject and the other as predicate, is to be repudiated
simply on the ground of style; and the difference among expositors shows
how equivocal the expression is.

On the other hand, when we translate it: "despicable is he in his own
eyes, worthy to be despised" (Ges. 134, 1), we can appeal to [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), where השׁהיתוּ is intensified
just in the same way by התעיבוּ, as נבזה is here by נמאס; cf. also [Gen
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#031.md); [Job
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#023.md); [Isa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004.md). The antithesis of [Psa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md) to [Psa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md) is also thus fully met: he
himself seems to himself unworthy of any respect, whereas he constantly
shows respect to others; and the standard by which he judges is the fear
of God. His own fear of Jahve is manifest from the self-denying
strictness with which he performs his vows. This sense of נשׁבּע להרע is
entirely misapprehended when it is rendered: he swears to his neighbour
(רע = רע), which ought to be לרענוּ, or: he swears to the wicked (and
keeps to what he has thus solemnly promised), which ought to be לרע; for
to what purpose would be the omission of the elision of the article,
which is extremely rarely ([Psa 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006).md)
not attended to in the classic style of the period before the Exile? The
words have reference to [Lev 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004.md) : if
any one swear, thoughtlessly pronouncing להרע או להיטיב, to do evil or
to do good, etc. The subject spoken of is oaths which are forgotten, and
the forgetting of which must be atoned for by an asham, whether the
nature of the oath be something unpleasant and injurious, or agreeable
and profitable, to the person making the vow. The retrospective
reference of להרע to the subject is self-evident; for to injure another
is indeed a sin, the vowing and performance of which, not its omission,
would require to be expiated. On להרע = להרע vid., Ges. 67, rem. 6. The
hypothetical antecedent (cf. e.g., [Kg2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#013).md) is followed by ולא ימר is an
apodosis. The verb המיר is native to the law of vows, which, if any one
has vowed an animal in sacrifice, forbids both changing it for its money
value (החליף) and exchanging it for another, be it טוב ברע או־רע בּטוב,
[Lev 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#010.md), [Lev
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#033.md). The psalmist of course does not
use these words in the technical sense in which they are used in the
Law. Swearing includes making a vow, and לא ימר disavows not merely any
exchanging of that which was solemnly promised, but also any alteration
of that which was sworn: he does not misuse the name of God in anywise,
לשּׁוא.

In [Psa 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005.md) the psalmist also has a
passage of the Tra before his mind, viz., [Lev
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#037.md), cf. [Exo
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#024.md); [Deu
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#020.md); [Eze
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008.md). נתן בּנשׁך signifies to give a
thing away in order to take usury (נשׁך( yrusu ekat ot r from נשׁך to
bite, δάκνειν) for it. The receiver or demander of interest is משּׁיך,
the one who pays interest נשׁוּך, the interest itself נשׁך. The trait of
character described in [Psa 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005.md) also
recalls the language of the Mosaic law: שׁחד לא לקח, the prohibition
[Exo 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#008.md); [Deu
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#019.md); and על־נקי, the curse [Deu
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#025.md) : on account of the innocent,
i.e., against him, to condemn him. Whether it be as a loan or as a gift,
he gives without conditions, and if he attain the dignity of a judge he
is proof against bribery, especially with reference to the destruction
of the innocent. And now instead of closing in conformity with the
description of character already given: such a man shall dwell, etc.,
the concluding sentence takes a different form, moulded in accordance
with the spiritual meaning of the opening question: he who doeth these
things shall never be moved (ימּוט fut. Niph.), he stands fast, being
upheld by Jahve, hidden in His fellowship; nothing from without, no
misfortune, can cause his overthrow.
