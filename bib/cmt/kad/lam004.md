Submission under the Judgment of God, and Hope

1 How the gold becomes dim, - the fine gold changeth, -

Sacred stones are scattered about at the top of every street!

2 The dear sons of Zion, who are precious as fine gold, -

How they are esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of a potters hands!

3 \[But\] the daughter of my people \[hath become\] cruel, like the
ostriches in the wilderness.

4 The tongue of the suckling cleaveth to his palate for thirst;

Young children ask for bread, \[but\] there is none breaking \[it\] for
them.

5 Those who ate dainties \[before\] are desolate in the streets;

Those who were carried on scarlet embrace dunghills.

6 The iniquity of the daughter of my people became greater than the sin
of Sodom,

Which was overthrown as in a moment, though no hands were laid on her.

7 Her princes were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk,

They were redder in body than corals, their form was \[that of\] a
sapphire.

8 \`Their form is darker than blackness, - they are not recognised in
the streets;

Their skin adhereth closely to their bones, - it hath become dry, like
wood.

9 Better are those slain with the sword than those slain with hunger;

For these pine away, pierced through from \[want of\] the fruits of the
field.

10 The hands of women \[who were once\] tender-hearted, have boiled
their own children;

They became food to them in the destruction of the daughter of my
people.

11 Jahveh accomplished His wrath: He poured out the burning of His
anger;

And kindled a fire in Zion, and it devoured her foundations.

12 Would the kinds of the earth, all the inhabitants of the world; not
believe

That an adversary and an enemy would enter in at the gates of Jerusalem.

13 Because of the sins of her prophets, the iniquities of her priests,

Who shed blood of righteous ones in her midst,

14 They wander \[like\] blind men in the streets; they are defiled with
blood,

So that \[people\] could not touch their clothes.

15 "Keep off! it is unclean!" they cried to them, "keep off! keep off!
touch not!"

When they fled, they also wandered;

\[People\] say among the nations, "They must no longer sojourn
\[here\]."

16 The face of Jahveh hath scattered them; no longer doth He look on
them:

They regard not the priests, they respect not old men.

17 Still do our eyes pine away, \[looking\] for our help, \[which is\]
vanity:

In our watching, we watched for a nation \[that\] will not help.

18 They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets;

Our end is near, our days are full, - yea, our end is come.

19 Our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of heaven;

They pursued us on the mountains, in the wilderness they laid wait for
us.

20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jahveh, was caught in
their pits,

\[Of\] whom we thought, "In His shadow we shall live among the nations."

21 Be glad and rejoice, O daughter of Edom, dwelling in the land of Uz

To thee also shall the cup pass; thou shalt be drunk, and make thyself
naked.

22 Thy guilt is at an end, O daughter of Zion; He will no more carry
thee captive:

He visiteth thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; He discovereth thy sins.

Lamentations 4:1-22

The lamentation over the terrible calamity that has befallen Jerusalem
is distinguished in this poem from the lamentations in Lamentations 1
and 2, not merely by the fact that in it the fate of the several classes
of the population is contemplated, but chiefly by the circumstance that
the calamity is set forth as a well-merited punishment by God for the
grievous sins of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. This consideration forms
the chief feature in the whole poem, from the beginning to the end of
which there predominates the hope that Zion will not perish, but that
the appointed punishment will terminate, and then fall on their now
triumphant enemies. In this fundamental idea of the poem, compared with
the first two, there is plainly an advance towards the due recognition
of the suffering as a punishment; from this point it is possible to
advance, not merely to the hope regarding the future, with which the
poem concludes, but also the prayer for deliverance in Lamentations 5.
The contents of the poem are the following: The princes and inhabitants
of Zion are sunk into a terrible state of misery, because their guilt
was greater than the sin of Sodom ([Lam
4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001).md). Jerusalem has been delivered
into the hands of her enemies on account of her prophets and priests,
who have shed the blood of righteous ones ([Lam
4:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012).md), and because the people have
placed their trust on the vain help of man ([Lam
4:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017).md). For this they must atone;
for the present, however, the enemy may triumph; the guilt of the
daughter of Zion will come to an end, and then the judgment will befall
her enemies ([Lam 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md), [Lam
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022).md).

[Lamentations 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 4:1</span></span>

The misery that has come on the inhabitants of Jerusalem is a punishment
for their deep guilt. The description given of this misery is divided
into two strophes: for, first ([Lam
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001).md), the sad lot of the several
classes of the population is set forth; then ([Lam
4:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007).md) a conclusion is drawn
therefrom regarding the greatness of their sin.

[Lam 4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md)

The first strophe. [Lam 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md). The
lamentation begins with a figurative account of the destruction of all
that is precious and glorious in Israel: this is next established by the
bringing forth of instances.

[Lam 4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md)

[Lam 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md), [Lam
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002.md) contain, not a complaint regarding
the desolation of the sanctuary and of Zion, as Maurer, Kalkschmidt, and
Thenius, with the lxx, assume, but, as is unmistakeably declared in [Lam
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002.md), a lamentation over the fearful
change that has taken place in the fate of the citizens of Zion. What is
stated in [Lam 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md) regarding the gold
and the precious stones must be understood figuratively; and in the case
of the "gold that has become dim," we can as little think of the
blackening of the gilding in the temple fabric when it was burnt, as
think of bricks (Thenius) when "the holy stones" are spoken of. The בּני
ציּון (inhabitants of Zion), [Lam 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002.md),
are likened to gold and sacred stones; here Thenius would arbitrarily
change בּני into בּתּי (houses, palaces). This change not merely has no
critical support, but is objectionable on the simple ground that there
is not a single word to be found elsewhere, through all the chapter,
concerning the destruction of the temple and the palaces; it is merely
the fate of the men, not of the buildings, that is bewailed. "How is
gold bedimmed!" יוּעם is the Hophal of עמם, to be dark, [Eze
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003.md), and to darken, [Eze
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md). The second clause, "how is fine
gold changed!" expresses the same thing. שׁנא = שׁנה, according to the
Chaldaizing usage, means to change (oneself), [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md). The growing dim and the changing
refer to the colour, the loss of brilliancy; for gold does not alter in
substance. B. C. Michaelis and Rosenmller are too specific when they
explain that the gold represents populus Judaicus (or the potior populi
Hebraei pars), qui (quae) quondam auri instar in sanctuario Dei
fulgebat, and when they see in אבּני קדשׁ an allusion to the stones in
the breast-plate of the high priest. Gold is generally an emblem of very
worthy persons, and "holy stones" are precious stones, intended for a
sacred purpose. Both expressions collectively form a figurative
description of the people of Israel, as called to be a holy nation and a
kingdom of priests. Analogous is the designation of the children of
Israel as אבּני נזר, [Zac 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#016.md)
(Gerlach). השׁתּפּך, to be poured out (at all the corners of the
streets), is a figurative expression, signifying disgraceful treatment,
as in [Lam 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md). In [Lam
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002.md) follows the application of the
figure to the sons (i.e., the citizens) of Zion, not merely the chief
nobles of Judah (Ewald), or the princes, nor children in the narrowest
sense of the word (Gerlach); for in what follows mention is made not
only of children ([Lam 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md), [Lam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004).md), but also of those who are grown
up ([Lam 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#005).md), and princes are not
mentioned till [Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md). As being
members of the chosen people, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem have been
held "dear," and "weighed out with gold," i.e., esteemed as of equal
value with gold (cf. [Job 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#016.md), [Job
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#019).md); but now, when Jerusalem is
destroyed, they have become regarded as earthenware pots, i.e., treated
as if they were utterly worthless, as "a work of the hands of the
potter," whereas Israel was a work of the hands of God, [Isa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007.md). סלא = סלה, cf. [Job
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#016.md), [Job
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#019.md) to weigh; Pual, be weighed out,
as an equivalent.

[Lam 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md)

This disregard or rejection of the citizens of Zion is evidence in [Lam
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md) and onwards by many examples,
beginning with children, ascending to adults (3-5), and ending with
princes. The starvation to death of the children ([Lam
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md), [Lam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004).md) is mentioned first; and the
frightful misery that has befallen Jerusalem is vividly set forth, by a
comparison of the way in which wild animals act towards their young with
the behaviour of the mothers of Jerusalem towards their children. Even
jackals (תּנּין for תּנּים, see on [Jer
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010).md) give their breasts to their
young ones to suck. חלצוּ , extrahunt mammam = they present their
breast. As Junius has remarked, the expression is taken a mulieribus
lactantibus, quae laxata veste mammam lactanti praebent; hence also we
are not, for the sake of this expression, to understand תּנּין as
meaning cetus (Bochart and Ngelsbach), regarding which animal Bochart
remarks (Hieroz. iii. p. 777, ed. Rosenmller), ceti papillas non
esseἐπιφανεῖς, quippe in mammis receptae tanquam in vaginis conduntur.
Rosenm@fcller has already rejected this meaning as minus apta for the
present passage. From the combination of jackals and ostriches as
inhabiting desert places ([Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021.md).;
[Job 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029).md), we have no hesitation in
fixing on "jackals" as the meaning here. "The daughter of my people"
(cf. [Lam 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011).md) here means the
inhabitants of Zion or Jerusalem. לאכזר, "has become cruel." The Kethib
כי ענים instead of כּיענים (Qeri) may possibly have arisen from a purely
accidental separation of the letters of the word in a MS, a reading
which was afterwards painfully retained by the scribes. But in many
codices noted by Kennicott and De Rossi, as well as in several old
editions, the word is found correctly joined, without any marginal note.
יענים means ostriches, usually בּת יענה ("daughter of crying," or
according to Gesenius, in his Thesaurus, and Ewald, following the
Syriac, "the daughter of gluttony"), the female ostrich. The comparison
with these animals is to be understood in accordance with [Job
39:16](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#016) : "she (the female ostrich.md)
treats her young ones harshly, as if they were not her own." This
popular belief is founded on the fact that the animal lays her eggs in
the ground, - after having done no more than slightly scratching up the
soil, - and partly also, when the nest is full, on the surface of the
ground; she then leaves them to be hatched, in course of time, by the
heat of the sun: the eggs may thus be easily broken, see on [Job
39:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#014.md).

[Lam 4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004.md)

Sucking infants and little children perish from thirst and hunger; cf.
[Lam 2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md). פּרשׂ = פּרס, as in [Mic
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003.md), to break down into pieces, break
bread = divide, [Isa 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007.md); [Jer
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007.md). In [Lam
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#005.md) it is not children, but adults,
that are spoken of. למעדנּים is variously rendered, since אכל occurs
nowhere else in construction with ל. Against the assumption that ל is
the Aramaic sign of the object, there stands the fact that אכל is not
found thus construed with ל, either in the Lamentations or elsewhere,
though in [Jer 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#002.md) ל is so used.
Gerlach, accordingly, would take למעדנּים adverbially, as meaning "after
their heart's desire," prop. for pleasures (as to this meaning, cf. [Pro
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#017.md); [Sa1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032).md), in contrast with אכל לשׂבע, to
eat for satisfaction, [Exo 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#003.md); [Lev
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#019.md), etc. But "for pleasure" is not
an appropriate antithesis to satisfaction. Hence we prefer, with
Thenius, to take אכל ל in the sense of nibbling round something, in
which there is contained the notion of selection in the eating; we also
take מעדנּים, as in [Gen 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020.md), to
mean dainties. נשׁמּוּ, to be made desolate, as in [Lam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#013.md), of the destruction of happiness
in life; with בּחוּצות, to sit in a troubled or gloomy state of mind on
the streets. האמנים, those who (as children) were carried on purple
(תּולע for שׁני rof תּו towla\`at תּולעת, cochineal, crimson), embrace
(i.e., cling to) dung-heaps, seek them as places or rest.

[Lam 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#006.md)

The greatness of their guilt is seen in this misery. The ו consecutive
joined with יגדּל here marks the result, so far as this manifests
itself: "thus the offence (guilt) of the daughter of my people has
become greater than the sin of Sodom." Most expositors take עון and
הטּאת dna here in the sense of punishment; but this meaning has not been
established. The words simply mean "offence" and "sin," sometimes
including their consequences, but nowhere do they mean unceremonious
castigation. But when Thenius is of opinion that the context demands the
meaning "punishment" (not "sin"), he has inconsiderately omitted the ו
consec., and taken a wrong view of the context. הפך is the usual word
employed in connection with the destruction of Sodom; cf. [Gen
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#021.md), [Gen
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025.md); [Deu
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md), etc. 'ולא חלוּ וגו is
translated by Thenius, et non torquebatur in ea manus, i.e., without any
one wringing his hands. However, חוּל (to go in a circle) means to
writhe with pain, but does not agree with ידים, to wring the hands. In
[Hos 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006.md) חוּל is used of the sword,
which "circles" in the cities, i.e., cuts and kills all round in them.
In like manner it is here used of the hands that went round in Sodom for
the purpose of overthrowing (destroying) the city. Ngelsbach wrongly
derives חלוּ from חלה, to become slack, powerless. The words, "no hands
went round (were at work) in her," serve to explain the meaning of כּמו
רגע, "as in a moment," without any need for the hands of men being
engaged in it. By this additional remark, not merely is greater
prominence given to the sudden destruction of Sodom by the hand of God;
but it is also pointed out how far Jerusalem, in comparison with that
judgment of God, suffers a greater punishment for her greater sins: for
her destruction by the hand of man brings her more enduring torments.
"Sodom's suffering at death was brief; for there were no children dying
of hunger, no mothers who boiled their children" (Ngelsbach). Sodom was
spared this heartrending misery, inasmuch as it was destroyed by the
hand of God in an instant.

[Lam 4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md)

The second strophe. - [Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md), [Lam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#008.md). The picture of the misery that
has befallen the princes. נזירים, princes, prop. separati, here non voto
(Nazarites) sed dignitate, as Nolde appropriately remarks; see on [Gen
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#026.md). זכך is used, [Job
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015.md); [Job
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005.md), of the brightness of the heaven
and the stars; here it is used of female beauty. Thenius would refer
"pure (or bright) as snow and milk" to the white clothing, "because the
Orientals have not milk-white faces." But the second member irrefragably
shows that the reference is to bodily form; and for the very reason
adduced by Thenius, a comparatively whiter skin than is commonly met
with is esteemed more beautiful. So also does [Sol
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010.md), "My friend is white and red,"
show the high esteem in which beauty was held (Gerlach). אדם, to be
reddish. עצם, "bone," for the body (pars pro toto). פּנינים, not (white)
pearls, but (red) corals. "The white and the red are to be understood as
mixed, and shading into one another, as our popular poetry speaks of
cheeks which 'like milk and purple shine' " (Delitzsch on [Job
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#018), Clark's translation.md). "Sapphire
their form" (גּזרה, prop. cut, taille, of the shape of the body). The
point of the comparison is not the colour, but the luminosity, of this
precious stone. Once on a time the princes glittered so; but ([Lam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#008).md) now their form is dark as
blackness, i.e., every trace of beauty and splendour has vanished.
Through hunger and want their appearance is so disfigured, that they are
no longer recognised in the streets (חוּצות, in contrast with "at home,"
in their own neighbourhood). "The skin sticks to the bones," so
emaciated are they; cf. [Psa 102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md);
[Job 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#020.md). צפד, ἅπ. λεγ., to adhere
firmly. The skin has become dry (יבשׁ) like wood.

[Lam 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009.md)

This pining away with hunger is much more horrible than a speedy death
by the sword. שׁהם, "for they" = qui ipsi; יזוּבוּ, prop. flow away,
i.e., pine away as those pierced through (מדקּרים, cf. [Jer
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#010.md); [Jer
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#004).md). 'מתּנוּבות שׁ does not mean "of
the fruits," but מן is a brief expression for "because there are no
fruits," i.e., from want of the produce of the field; cf. בּשׂרי , "my
flesh wastes away from oil," i.e., because there is a want of oil, [Psa
109:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#024.md). There was thus no need for the
conjecture מתּלאבות, "from burning glow," from drought, which has been
proposed by Ewald in order to obtain the following sense, after
supplying כּ: "as if melting away through the drought of the field,
emaciated by the glowing heat of the sun." The free rendering of the
Vulgate, consumpti a sterilitate terrae, gives no support to the
conjecture.

[Lam 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010.md)

Still more horrible was the misery of the women. In order to keep
themselves from dying of hunger, mothers boiled their children for food
to themselves; cf. [Lam 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md). By the
predicate "compassionate," applied to hands, the contrast between this
conduct and the nature, or the innate love, of mothers to their
children, is made particularly prominent. בּרות is a noun = בּרוּת, [Psa
69:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022.md). On "the destruction of the
daughter of my people," cf. [Lam 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md).

[Lam 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#011.md)

This fearful state of matters shows that the Lord has fully poured out
His wrath upon Jerusalem and His people. כּלּה, to complete, bring to an
end. The kindling of the fire in Zion, which consumed the foundations,
is not to be limited to the burning of Jerusalem, but is a symbol of the
complete destruction of Zion by the wrath of God; cf. [Deu
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032.md).

[Lamentations 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 4:12</span></span>

This judgment of wrath is a consequence of the sins of the prophets and
priests ([Lam 4:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012).md), as well as of
their vain trust on the help of man ([Lam
4:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017).md). [Lam
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md). The capture of Jerusalem by
enemies (an event which none in all the world thought possible) has been
brought on through the sins of the prophets and priests. The words, "the
kings of the earth...did not believe that an enemy would come in at the
gates of Jerusalem," are well explained by C. B. Michaelis, thus:
reputando fortitudinem urbis, quae munitissima erat, tum defensorem ejus
Jehovam, qui ab hostibus, ad internecionem caesis, urbem aliquoties,
mirifice liberaverat, e.g., 2 Reg. 19:34. The words certainly form a
somewhat overdrawn expression of deep subjective conviction; but they
cannot properly be called a hyperbole, because the remark of Ngelsbach,
that Jerusalem had been taken more than once before Nebuchadnezzar ([Kg1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#026.md); [Kg2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md).; [Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md); [Kg2
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033)..md), seems incorrect. For the
occasions upon which Jerusalem was taken by Shishak and by Joash king of
Israel (1 Kings 14 and 2 Kings 14) belong to those earlier times when
Jerusalem was far from being so strongly fortified as it afterwards
became, in the times of Uzziah, Jotham, and Manasseh ([Ch2
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009.md); [Ch2
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003.md); [Ch2
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014).md). In [Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md), on the other hand, there is
nothing said of Jerusalem being taken; and the capture by Pharaoh-Necho
does not call for consideration, in so far as it forms the beginning of
the catastrophe, whose commencement was thought impossible. Ewald
wrongly connects [Lam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md) with [Lam
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md) into one sentence, thus: "that an
enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem because of the sins of her
prophets," etc. The meaning of these verses is thereby not merely
weakened, but also misrepresented; and there is ascribed to the kings
and inhabitants of the world an opinion regarding the internal evils of
Jerusalem, which they neither pronounced nor could have pronounced.

[Lam 4:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md)

[Lam 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md) contains an exclamation over
the incredible event that has happened, and [Lam
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md) assigns the cause of it: the
mediating and combining thought, "this incredible thing has happened,"
suggests itself. It has taken place on account of the sins of her
prophets and priests, who have shed the blood of righteous men in
Jerusalem. A historic proof of this is furnished in [Jer
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#007.md)., where priests and prophets
indicted Jeremiah on a capital charge, because he had announced that
Jerusalem and the temple would suffer the fate of Shiloh; from this,
Ngelsbach rightly concludes that, in any case, the burden of the guilt
of the martyr-blood that was shed falls on the priests and prophets.
Besides this, cf. the denunciations of the conduct of the priests and
prophets in [Jer 6:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013.md); [Jer
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011.md); [Jer
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#010.md); [Eze
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025.md). - In [Lam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md), [Lam
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015.md), there is described the fate of
these priests and prophets, but in such a way that Jeremiah has,
throughout, mainly the priests before his mind. We may then, without
further hesitation, think of the priests as the subject of נעוּ,
inasmuch as they are mentioned last. Kalkschmidt wrongly combines [Lam
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md) and [Lam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md), thus: "because of the sins of
the prophets...they wander about," etc.; in this way, the Israelites
would be the subject to נעוּ, and in [Lam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md) the calamitas ex sacerdotum
prophetarumque sceleribus profecta would be described. This, however, is
contradicted, not merely by the undeniable retrospection of the
expression, "they have polluted themselves with blood" ([Lam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014).md), to the shedding of blood
mentioned in [Lam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md), but also by
the whole contents of [Lam 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md),
especially the impossibility of touching their clothes, which does not
well apply to the people of Israel (Judah), but only to the priests
defiled with blood. Utterly erroneous is the opinion of Pareau, Ewald,
and Thenius, that in [Lam 4:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md)
there is "presented a fragment from the history of the last siege of
Jerusalem," - a rupture among the besieged, headed by the most eminent
of the priests and prophets, who, filled with frenzy and passion against
their fellow-citizens, because they would not believe in the speedy
return of the exiles, became furious, and caused their opponents to be
murdered. Regarding this, there is neither anything historical known,
nor is there any trace of it to be discovered in these verses. The
words, "prophets and priests hesitated (or wavered) like blind men on
the streets, soiled with blood, so that none could touch their clothes,"
merely state that these men, smitten of God in consequence of their
blood-guiltiness, wandered up and down in the streets of the city, going
about like blind men. This description has been imitated from such
passages as [Deu 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#028.md)., [Jer
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012.md); [Isa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md), where the people, and especially
their leaders, are threatened, as a punishment, with blind and helpless
staggering; but it is not to be referred to the time of the last siege
of Jerusalem. עורים does not mean caedium perpetrandarum insatiabili
cupiditate occaecati (Rosenmller), nor "as if intoxicated with blood
that has been shed" (Ngelsbach), but as if struck with blindness by God,
so that they could no longer walk with firm and steady step. "They are
defiled with blood" is a reminiscence from [Isa
59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003.md). As to the form נגאל, compounded
of the Niphal and Pual, cf. Ewald, 132, b, and Delitzsch on Isaiah, l.c.
בּלא יוּכלוּ, without one being able, i.e., so that one could not. As to
the construction of יכול with a finite verb following, instead of the
infinitive with ל, cf. Ewald, 285, c, c, and Gesenius, 142, 3, b.

[Lam 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015.md)

"Yea, they (people) address to them the warning cry with which,
according to [Lev 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md), lepers were
obliged to warn those whom they met not to come near." Such is the
language in which Gerlach has rightly stated the connection between [Lam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md) and [Lam
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015.md). קראוּ למו is rendered by many,
"people shouted out regarding them," de iis, because, according to [Lev
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md), it was the lepers who were to
shout "Unclean!" to those they met; the cry therefore was not addressed
to the unclean, but to those who, being clean, were not to defile
themselves by touching lepers. But though this meaning may be taken from
the language used (cf. [Gen 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#013.md);
[Psa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003).md), yet here, where the call is
addressed to persons, it is neither probable nor necessary. For it does
not follow from the allusion to the well-known direction given to
lepers, that this prescription is transferred verbatim to the present
case. The call is here addressed to the priests, who are staggering
towards them with blood-stained garments. These must get out of the way,
and not touch those they meet. The sing. טמא .gni is accounted for by
the allusion to [Lev 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md), and means,
"Out of the way! there comes one who is unclean." The second half of the
verse is variously viewed. נצוּ, as Milra, comes from נצה, which in
Niphal means to wrangle, in Hiphil to stir up strife. The Vulgate,
accordingly, translates jurgati quippe sunt, and Ewald still renders,
"yet they quarrelled, yet they staggered." But this view is opposed by
these considerations: (1.) כּי...גּם can neither introduce an
antithesis, nor mean "yet...yet." (2.) In view of the shedding of blood,
wrangling is a matter of too little importance to deserve mention.
Luther's rendering, "because they feared and fled from them," is a mere
conjecture, and finds no support whatever from the words employed. Hence
Gesenius, in his Thesaurus, has rightly explained נצוּ, after נצא, [Jer
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#009.md), "to fly, flee, or take to
flight." Following him, the moderns translate: "because they had fled,
they also staggered about." It is better to render כּי by quum, "when
they fled," sc. to other nations, not specially to the Chaldeans. נעוּ
is selected with reference to what precedes, but in the general meaning
of roaming restlessly about. The idea is as follows: Not merely were
they shunned at home, like lepers, by their fellow-countrymen, but also,
when they wished to find a place of refuge beyond their native land,
they were compelled to wander about without finding rest; for they said
among the nations, "They shall no longer sojourn among us." Thus the
curse came on them, [Deu 28:65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065.md).

[Lam 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016.md)

This was the judgment of God. His face (i.e., in this connection, His
angry look; cf. [Lev 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010.md); [Psa
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010).md) has scattered them (חלּק as in
[Gen 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007)). No longer does He (Jahveh.md)
look on the, sc. graciously. The face of the priests is not regarded.
נשׂא, πρόσωπον λαμβάνειν, to regard the person of any one, i.e., to have
respect to his position, dignity, and age: the expression is here
synonymous with חנן, to show favour. The subject is indefinite, but the
enemy is meant. Thus the threatening in [Deu
28:50](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#050.md) is fulfilled on them. זקנים does
not mean "elders," but "old men," for the words can be referred only to
the priests and prophets formerly spoken of.

[Lam 4:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017.md)

In spite of these facts, which show that God has poured out His fury on
us, and that our prophets and priests have been smitten by God for their
sins, we still wait, vainly relying on the help of man. In this way,
[Lam 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017.md) is attached to what
precedes, - not merely to [Lam 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016.md),
but also the series of thoughts developed in [Lam
4:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md), viz., that in the capture of
Jerusalem (which nobody thought possible) there is plainly made known
the judgment of God upon the sins of His people and their leaders. It is
with special emphasis that עודינה stands at the beginning of the verse:
"still do our eyes continue to waste away." The form עודינה (Kethib), in
place of which the Qeri subtitles עודינוּ, is abnormal, since עוד does
not take plural forms of the suffix in any other instance, and ־נה does
not occur elsewhere as a noun-suffix. The form is evidently copied from
תּכלינה, and must be third fem. pl., as distinguished from the singular
suffix עודנּה, [Kg1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#022.md). The Qeri
עודינוּ, which is preferred by Michaelis, Pareau, Rosenmller, and
Thenius, has for its basis the idea "we still were;" this is shown by
the translation ἔτι ὄντων ἡμῶν of the lxx, and cum adhuc subsisteremus
of Jerome. But this view of the word, like most of the Qeris, is a
useless attempt at explanation; for עודינוּ alone cannot have the
meaning attributed to it. and the supplements proposed, in statu priori,
or "in the city," are but arbitrary insertions into the text. The
combination עודינוּ תּכלינה, which is a rare one, evidently means, "our
eyes are still pining (consuming) away," so that the imperfect is used
with the meaning of the participle; cf. Ewald, 306, c, Rem. 2. The
combination of כלה with אל is pregnant: "they consume away (while
looking out) for our help;" cf. [Deu
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#028.md); [Psa
69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004.md). הבל is not an exclamation, "in
vain!" (Thenius), but stands in apposition to "our help;" thus, "for our
help, a help of vanity," i.e., for a vain help; cf. Ewald, 287, c. The
vain help is more distinctly specified in the second member of the
verse, as a looking out for a nation that will not help. צפיּה does not
mean "the watch-tower" (Chald., Syr., etc.), - because "on the
watch-tower" would require to be expressed by על; cf. [Isa
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#008.md); [Ch2
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#024.md), - but "watching." By the
"nation that does not help," expositors, following [Jer
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007.md), think that Egypt is intended.
But the words must by no means be referred to the event there described,
inasmuch as we should then be obliged to take the verbs as preterites-a
course which would not accord with the interchange of the imperfect
(תּכלינה) with the perfect (צפּינוּ). A strange confusion would also
arise, such as is made out by Vaihinger: for we would find the prophet
placing his readers, in [Lam 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md), in
the time of the siege of Jerusalem; then, in [Lam
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015.md), into the conquered city; and in
[Lam 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017.md) and [Lam
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#018.md), back once more into the
beleaguered city, which we again, in [Lam
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#019), see conquered (Gerlach.md).
According to [Lam 4:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#018.md), Judah is
completely in the power of the Chaldeans; hence the subject treated of
in [Lam 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017.md) is the looking out for
the assistance of some nation, after the enemy had already taken
Jerusalem and laid it in ashes. What the prophet denounces, then, is
that help is still looked for from a nation which nevertheless will not
help. In this, perhaps, he may have had Egypt before his mind; for, that
the Jews, even after the destruction of Jerusalem, still looked for
deliverance or help from Egypt, may be inferred partly from the fact
that those who were left in the country fled thither for refuge, and
partly from [Eze 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#016.md). Only, the
words are not to be restricted merely to this.

[Lam 4:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#018.md)

In order to show convincingly how vain it is to expect help from man,
Jeremiah, in [Lam 4:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#018.md), reminds his
readers of the events immediately preceding the capture of the city,
which have proved that nobody - not even the king himself - could avoid
falling into the hands of the Chaldeans. Gerlach has correctly given the
sense of these verses thus: "They still cling to their hopes, and are
nevertheless completely in the power of the enemy, from whom they cannot
escape. All their movements are closely watched; it is impossible for
any one to deceive himself any longer: it is all over with the nation,
now that all attempts at flight have failed ([Lam
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#019).md), and that the king, 'the life's
breath' of the nation, has fallen into the hands of the enemy." Gerlach
and Ngelsbach have already very properly set aside the strange and
fanciful idea of Ewald, that in [Lam
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#018.md) it is still Egypt that is
regarded, and that the subject treated of is, - how Egypt, merely
through fear of the Chaldeans, had at that time publicly forbidden the
fugitives to go to Palestine for purposes of grace and traffic. These
same writers have also refuted the arbitrary interpretation put upon
'צדוּ צעדינוּ by Thenius and Vaihinger, who imagine there is a reference
to towers used in a siege, from which the besiegers could not merely
perceive all that was going on within the city, but also shoot at
persons who showed themselves in exposed places. In reply to this,
Ngelsbach appropriately remarks that we must not judge of the
siege-material of the ancients by the range of cannon. Moreover, צוּד
does not mean to spy out, but to search out, pursue; and the figure is
taken from the chase. The idea is simply this: The enemy (the Chaldeans)
watch us in our every step, so that we can no longer move freely about.
Our end is near, yea, it is already come; cf. [Eze
7:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#002.md). A proof of this is given in the
capture of King Zedekiah, after he had fled in the night, [Lam
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#019.md). For an elucidation of the
matters contained in these verses, cf. [Jer
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004.md)., [Jer
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007.md). The comparison of the enemy to
eagles is taken from [Deu 28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md),
whence Jeremiah has already derived [Lam
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md) and 48:40. דּלק, prop. to burn,
metaph. to pursue hotly, is here (poet.) construed with acc., but
elsewhere with אחרי; cf. [Gen 31:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#036.md);
[Sa1 17:53](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#053.md). "On the hills and in the
wilderness," i.e., on every side, even in inaccessible places. "In the
wilderness" alludes to the capture of Zedekiah; cf. [Jer
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005.md). "The breath of our nostrils" is
an expression founded on [Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md), and
signifying "our life's breath." Such is the designation given to the
king, - not Zedekiah in special, whose capture is here spoken of,
because he ex initio magnam de se spem concitaverat, fore ut post
tristia Jojakimi et Jechoniae fata pacatior res publica esset (Aben
Ezra, Michaelis, Vaihinger), but the theocratic king, as the anointed of
the Lord, and as the one who was the bearer of God's promise, 2 Sam 7.
In elucidation of the figurative expression, Pareau has appropriately
reminded is of Seneca's words (Clement. i. 4): ille (princeps) est
spiritus vitalis, quem haec tot millia (civium) trahunt. "What the
breath is, in relation to the life and stability of the body, such is
the king in relation to the life and stability of the nation" (Gerlach).
"Of whom we said (thought), Under his shadow (i.e., protection and
covering) we shall live among the nations." It is not implied in these
words, as Ngelsbach thinks, that "they hoped to fall in with a friendly
heathen nation, and there, clustering around their king, as their
protector and the pledge of a better future, spend their days in
freedom, if no more," but merely that, under the protection of their
king, they hoped to live even among the heathen, i.e., to be able to
continue their existence, and to prosper as a nation. For, so long as
there remained to them the king whom God had given, together with the
promises attached to the kingdom, they might cherish the hope that the
Lord would still fulfil to them these promises also. But this hope
seemed to be destroyed when the king was taken prisoner, deprived of
sight, and carried away to Babylon into captivity. The words "taken in
their pits" are figurative, and derived from the capture of wild
animals. שׁחית as in [Psa 107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md). On
the figure of the shadow, cf. [Jdg
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#015.md); [Eze
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#017.md).

[Lamentations 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 4:21</span></span>

However, it is not yet all over with Israel. Let the enemy triumph; the
guilt of the daughter of Zion will come to an end, and then the guilt of
the daughter of Edom will be punished. With this "Messianic hope," as
Ewald rightly characterizes the contents of these verses, the
lamentation resolves itself into joyous faith and hope regarding the
future of Israel. There is no external sign to mark the transition from
the depths of lamentation over the hopeless condition of Judah, to new
and hopeful confidence, just as in the Psalms there is frequently a
sudden change from the deepest lamentation to joyful confidence of final
victory. But these transitions have their origin in the firm conviction
that Israel has most assuredly been chosen as the nation with whom the
Lord has made His covenant, which He cannot break. This truth has
already been clearly and distinctly expressed in the threatenings and
promises of the law, Lev 26 and Deut 28, and is reiterated by all the
prophets. The Lord will assuredly visit His ever-rebellious people with
the heaviest punishments, until they come to acknowledge their sin and
repent of their apostasy; but He will afterwards again take pity on the
penitent remnant, gather them from among the heathen, and fulfil all His
promises to them. The words "exult and rejoice" are ironical, and
signify: "Rejoice as much as you please; you will not, for all that,
escape the punishment for your sins." "The daughter of Edom," i.e., the
people of Edom, is named as the representative of the enemies of God's
people, on account of their implacable hatred against Israel; see on
[Jer 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md). From the designation,
"dwelling in the land of Uz," it does not follow that the Edomite had at
that time spread themselves widely over their original territory; for
the land of Uz, according to [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md), lay on the confines of Idumea.
As to the form יושׁבתּי, see on [Jer
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017.md). גּם עליך, "towards thee also
(sc., as now to Judah) shall the cup pass." On this figure, cf. [Jer
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md). התערה, to make oneself naked,
or to become naked in consequence of drunkenness ([Gen
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#022).md), is a figurative expression
indicative of the disgrace that will befall Edom; cf. [Lam
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#008.md); [Nah
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005.md). תּם עונך, "Thy guilt is ended."
The perfect is prophetic. The guilt is ended when it is atoned for; the
punishment for it has reached its end, or grace begins. That this will
take place in the Messianic times (as was pointed out long ago in the
Chaldee paraphrase, et liberaberis per manum Messiae), is not indeed
implied in the word תּם, but it is a necessary product of the Messianic
hope of Israel; cf, for instance, [Jer
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#020.md). To this it cannot be objected
(with Gerlach), that it is inadmissible to transfer into the Messianic
time also the punishment of Edom threatened in the second member: for,
according to the prophetic mode of viewing things, the judgment on the
heathen world falls, as a matter of course, in the Messianic age; and to
refer the words to the chastisement of the Edomites by Nebuchadnezzar is
against the context of both verses. "To reveal (discover) sins" means to
punish them; for God uncovers the sins in order to punish them,
quemadmodum Deus peccata tegere dicitur, cum eorum paenam remittit
(Rosenmller); cf. [Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), [Psa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md); [Psa
85:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#003.md), etc.
