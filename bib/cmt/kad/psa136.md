### [Psalms Chapter 136](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 136:0</span></span>

O Give Thanks unto the Lord, for He Is Good

The cry [Psa 135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003.md), Praise ye Jāh, for
good is Jahve, is here followed by a Hodu, the last of the collection,
with "for His goodness endureth for ever" repeated twenty-six times as a
versus intercalaris. In the liturgical language this Psalm is called par
excellence the great Hallel, for according to its broadest compass the
great Hallel comprehends Ps 120-136,

(Note: There are three opinions in the Talmud and Midrash concerning the
compass of the "Great Hallel," viz., (1) Ps 136, (2) Ps. 135:4-136:26,
(3) Ps 120-136.)

whilst the Hallel which is absolutely so called extends from [Psa
113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md) to Ps 118. Down to [Psa
136:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#018.md) the song and counter-song
organize themselves into hexastichic groups or strophes, which, however,
from [Psa 136:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#019.md) (and therefore from
the point where the dependence on Ps 135, already begun with [Psa
136:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#017), becomes a borrowing, onwards.md)
pass over into octastichs. In Heidenheim's Psalter the Psalm appears
(after Norzi) in two columns (like Deut. 32), which it is true has
neither tradition (vid., Ps 18) nor MSS precedent in its favour, but
really corresponds to its structure.

[Psalms 136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 136:1</span></span>

Like the preceding Psalm, this Psalm allies itself to the Book of
Deuteronomy. [Psa 136:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#002.md) and [Psa
136:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#003) (God of gods and Lord of lords.md)
are taken from [Deu 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017.md); [Psa
136:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#012.md) (with a strong hand and
stretched-out arm) from [Deu 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md);
[Deu 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015.md), and frequently (cf. [Jer
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#021).md); [Psa
136:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#016.md) like [Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md) (cf. [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006).md). With reference to the
Deuteronomic colouring of [Psa
136:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#019.md), vid., on [Psa
135:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010.md); also the expression "Israel
His servant" recalls [Deu 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md) (cf.
[Psa 135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014.md); [Psa
90:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#013).md), and still more [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md), where the comprehension of
Israel under the unity of this notion has its own proper place. In other
respects, too, the Psalm is an echo of earlier model passages. Who alone
doeth great wonders sounds like [Psa
72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018.md) ([Psa
86:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#010).md); and the adjective "great" that
is added to "wonders" shows that the poet found the formula already in
existence. In connection with [Psa
136:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#005.md) he has [Pro
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019.md) or [Jer
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012.md) in his mind; תּבוּנה, like חכמה,
is the demiurgic wisdom. [Psa 136:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#006.md)
calls to mind [Isa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005.md); [Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024.md); the expression is "above the
waters," as in [Psa 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#002.md) "upon the
seas," because the water is partly visible and partly invisible מתּחת
לארץ ([Exo 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004).md). The plural אורים,
luces, instead of מארות, lumina (cf. [Eze
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#008), מאורי אור.md), is without
precedent. It is a controverted point whether אורת in [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md) signifies lights (cf. אורה, [Psa
139:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#012).md) or herbs ([Kg2
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039).md). The plural ממשׁלות is also rare
(occurring only besides in [Psa
114:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#002).md): it here denotes the dominion
of the moon on the one hand, and (going beyond [Gen
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016).md) of the stars on the other.
בּלּילה, like בּיּום, is the second member of the stat. construct.

[Psalms 136:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 136:10</span></span>

Up to this point it is God the absolute in general, the Creator of all
things, to the celebration of whose praise they are summoned; and from
this point onwards the God of the history of salvation. In [Psa
136:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#013.md) גּזר (instead of בּקע, [Psa
78:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#013.md); [Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md); [Neh
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#011).md) of the dividing of the Red Sea
is peculiar; גּזרים ([Gen 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md), side
by side with בּתרים) are the pieces or parts of a thing that is cut up
into pieces. נער is a favourite word taken from [Exo
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#027.md). With reference to the name of
the Egyptian ruler Pharaoh (Herodotus also, ii. 111, calls the Pharaoh
of the Exodus the son of Sesostris-Rameses Miumun, not Μενόφθας, as he
is properly called, but absolutely Φερῶν), vid., on [Psa
73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022.md). After the God to whom the
praise is to be ascribed has been introduced with ל by always fresh
attributes, the ל before the names of Sihon and of Og is perplexing. The
words are taken over, as are the six lines of [Psa
136:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#017.md) in the main, from [Psa
135:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010.md), with only a slight
alteration in the expression. In [Psa
136:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#023.md) the continued influence of the
construction הודוּ ל is at an end. The connection by means of שׁ (cf.
[Psa 135:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008.md), [Psa
135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010).md) therefore has reference to the
preceding "for His goodness endureth for ever." The language here has
the stamp of the latest period. It is true זכר with Lamed of the object
is used even in the earliest Hebrew, but שׁפל is only authenticated by
[Ecc 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#006.md), and פּרק, to break loose =
to rescue (the customary Aramaic word for redemption), by [Lam
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#008.md), just as in the closing verse,
which recurs to the beginning, "God of heaven" is a name for God
belonging to the latest literature, [Neh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md); [Neh
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#004.md). In [Psa
136:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#023.md) the praise changes suddenly to
that which has been experienced very recently. The attribute in [Psa
136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025.md) (cf. [Psa
147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md); [Psa
145:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015).md) leads one to look back to a
time in which famine befell them together with slavery.
