### [Proverbs Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 6:1</span></span>

The author warns against suretyship; or rather, he advises that if one
has made himself surety, he should as quickly as possible withdraw from
the snare.

1 My son, if thou hast become surety for thy neighbour,

Hast given thy hand for another:

2 Thou art entangled in the words of thy mouth,

Ensnared in the words of thy mouth.

3 Do this then, my son, and free thyself -

For thou hast come under the power of thy neighbour -

Go, instantly entreat and importune thy neighbour.

4 Give no sleep to thine eyes,

And no slumber to thine eyelids;

5 Tear thyself free like a gazelle from his hand,

And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

The chief question here is, whether ל after ערב introduces him for whom
or with whom one becomes surety. Elsewhere ערב (R. רב, whence also ארב,
nectere, to twist close and compact) with the accusative of the person
means to become surety for any one, to represent him as a surety, [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015.md); [Pro
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#016.md) ([Pro
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#013).md), [Gen
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#009.md); [Gen
44:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#033.md) (as with the accusative of the
matter, to pledge anything, to deposit it as a pledge, [Jer
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md); [Neh
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#003.md), = שׂים, Arab. waḍ'a, [Job
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003).md); and to become surety with any
one is expressed, [Gen 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#018.md), by ערב
לפני. The phrase ערב ל is not elsewhere met with, and is thus
questionable. If we look to [Pro 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#003.md),
the רע (רעה) mentioned there cannot possibly be the creditor with whom
one has become surety, for so impetuous and urgent an application to him
would be both purposeless and unbecoming. But if he is meant for whom
one has become surety, then certainly לרעך is also to be understood of
the same person, and ל is thus dat. commodi; similar to this is the
Targumic ערבוּתא על, suretyship for any one, [Pro
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018.md); [Pro
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026.md). But is the זר, 1b,
distinguished from רעך, the stranger with whom one has become surety?
The parallels [Pro 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015.md); [Pro
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#016.md), where זר denotes the person
whom one represents, show that in both lines one and the same person is
meant; זר is in the Proverbs equivalent to אחר, each different from the
person in the discourse, [Pro 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#017.md);
[Pro 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#002.md) - thus, like רעך, denotes
not the friend, but generally him to whom one stands in any kind of
relation, even a very external one, in a word, the fellow-creatures or
neighbours, [Pro 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#028.md) (cf. the Arab.
sahbk and ḳarynk, which are used as vaguely and superficially). It is
further a question, whether we have to explain 1b: if thou hast given
thine hand to another, or for another. Here also we are without evidence
from the usage of the language; for the phrase תּקע כּף, or merely תּקע,
appears to be used of striking the hand in suretyship where it elsewhere
occurs without any further addition, [Pro
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018.md); [Pro
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026.md); [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015.md); however, [Job
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003.md), נתקע ליד appears the same: to
strike into the hand of any one, i.e., to give to him the hand-stroke.
From this passage Hitzig concludes that the surety gave the hand-stroke,
without doubt in the presence of witnesses, first of all of the
creditor, to the debtor, as a sign that he stood for him. But this idea
is unnatural, and the "without doubt" melts into air. He on whose hand
the stroke falls is always the person to whom one gives suretyship, and
confirms it by the hand-stroke. Job also, l.c., means to say: who else
but Thou, O Lord, could give to me a pledge, viz., of my innocence? If
now the זר, v. 1b, is, as we have shown, not the creditor,

(Note: A translation by R. Joseph Joel of Fulda, 1787, whose autograph
MS Baer possesses, renders the passage not badly thus: - "My son, if
thou hast become surety for thy friend, and hast given the hand to
another, then thou art bound by thy word, held by thy promise. Yet do
what I say to thee, my son: Be at pains as soon as thou canst to get
free, otherwise thou art in the power of thy friend; shun no trouble, be
urgent with thy friend.")

but the debtor, then is the ל the dat. commodi, as 1a, and the two lines
perfectly correspond. תּקע properly means to drive, to strike with a
resounding noise, cogn. with the Arab. wak'a, which may be regarded as
its intrans. (Fl.); then particularly to strike the hand or with the
hand. He to whom this hand-pledge is given for another remains here
undesignated. A new question arises, whether in [Pro
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006), where נוקשׁ (illaqueari.md) and
נלכּד (comprehendi) follow each other as [Isa
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#015.md), cf. [Jer
50:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#024.md), the hypothetical antecedent is
continued or not. We agree with Schultens, Ziegler, and Fleischer
against the continuance of the אם. The repetition of the בּאמרי פיך (cf.
[Pro 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#014).md) serves rightly to
strengthen the representation of the thought: thou, thou thyself and no
other, hast then ensnared thyself in the net; but this strengthening of
the expression would greatly lose in force by placing [Pro
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#002.md) in the antecedent, while if [Pro
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#002.md) is regarded as the conclusion, and
thus as the principal proposition, it appears in its full strength.

[Pro 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#003.md)

The new commencement needs no particle denoting a conclusion; the אפוא,
making the summons emphatic (cf. [Kg2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#010.md), frequently in interrogative
clauses), connects it closely enough. זאת, neut., refers to what
follows. The ו before הנּצל is explanatory, as we say in familiar
language: Be so good as tell me, or do me the favour to come with me;
while no Frenchman would say, Faites-moi le (ce) plaisir et venez avec
moi (Fl.).

(Note: For the right succession of the accents here (three serviles
before the Pazer), vid., Torath Emeth, p. 30; Accentuationssystem, xii.
4. According to Gen-Naphtali, Mercha is to be given to the זאת.)

The clause כּי באת

(Note: The Zinnorith before the Mahpach in these words represents at the
same time the Makkeph and rejects the Zinnorith; vid., Torath Emeth, p.
16, and my Psalmencomm. Bd. ii. (1860), p. 460, note 2.)

is not to be translated: in case thou art fallen into the hand of thy
neighbour; for this is represented ([Pro
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md), [Pro
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#002).md) as having already in fact
happened. On two sides the surety is no longer sui juris: the creditor
has him in his hand; for if the debtor does not pay, he holds the
surety, and in this way many an honourable man has lost house and goods,
Sirach 29:18, cf. 8:13; - and the debtor has him, the surety, in his
hand; for the performance which is due, for which the suretyship avails,
depends on his conscientiousness. The latter is here meant: thou hast
made thy freedom and thy possessions dependent on the will of thy
neighbour for whom thou art the surety. The clause introduced with כּי
gives the reason for the call to set himself free (הנּצל from נצל, R.
צל, של, to draw out or off); it is a parenthetical sentence. The meaning
of התרפּס is certain. The verb רפס (רפשׂ, רפס) signifies to stamp on,
calcare, conclucare; the Kams

(Note: el-Feyroozbdee's Kmus, a native Arabic Lexicon; vid., Lane's
Arab. Lex. Bk. i. pt. 1, p. xvii.)

explains rafas by rakad balarjal. The Hithpa. might, it is true, mean to
conduct oneself in a trampling manner, to tread roughly, as התנבּא, and
the medial Niph. נבּא, to conduct oneself speaking (in an impassioned
manner); but [Psa 68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031.md) and the
analogy of התבּוסס favour the meaning to throw oneself in a stamping
manner, i.e., violently, to the ground, to trample upon oneself - i.e.,
let oneself be trampled upon, to place oneself in the attitude of most
earnest humble prayer. Thus the Graec. Venet. πατήθητι, Rashi ("humble
thyself like to the threshold which is trampled and trode upon"),
Aben-Ezra, Immanuel ("humble thyself under the soles of his feet"); so
Cocceius, J. H. Michaelis, and others: conculcandum te praebe. וּרהב is
more controverted. The Talmudic-Midrash explanation (b. Joma, 87a;
Bathra, 173b, and elsewhere): take with thee in great numbers thy
friends (רהב = הרבּה), is discredited by this, that it has along with it
the explanation of התרפס by (יד) פּס חתּר, solve palmam (manus), i.e.,
pay what thou canst. Also with the meaning to rule (Parchon, Immanuel),
which רהב besides has not, nothing is to be done. The right meaning of
רהב בּ is to rush upon one boisterously, [Isa
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005.md). רהב means in general to be
violently excited (Arab. rahiba, to be afraid), and thus to meet one,
here with the accusative: assail impetuously thy neighbour (viz., that
he fulfil his engagement). Accordingly, with a choice of words more or
less suitable, the lxx translates by παρόξυνε, Symm., Theodotion by
παρόρμησον, the Graec. Venet. by ἐνίσχυσον, the Syr. (which the
Targumist copies) by גרג (solicita), and Kimchi glosses by: lay an
arrest upon him with pacifying words. The Talmud explains רעיך as plur.;

(Note: There is here no distinction between the Kethb and the Kerı̂. The
Masora remarks, "This is the only passage in the Book of Proverbs where
the word is written with Yod (י);" it thus recognises only the
undisputed רעיך.)

but the plur., which was permissible in [Pro
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#028.md), is here wholly inadmissible: it
is thus the plena scriptio for רעך with the retaining of the third
radical of the ground-form of the root-word (רעי = רעה), or with י as
mater lectionis, to distinguish the pausal-form from that which is
without the pause; cf. [Pro 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#034.md).
lxx, Syr., Jerome, etc., rightly translate it in the sing. The
immediateness lying in לך (cf. ὕπαγε, [Mat
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#024).md) is now expressed as a duty, [Pro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#004.md). One must not sleep and slumber
(an expression quite like [Psa 132:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#004).md),
not give himself quietness and rest, till the other has released him
from his bail by the performance of that for which he is surety. One
must set himself free as a gazelle or as a bird, being caught, seeks to
disentangle itself by calling forth all its strength and art.

[Pro 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#005.md)

The naked מיּד is not to be translated "immediately;" for in this sense
the word is rabbinical, not biblical. The versions (with exception of
Jerome and the Graec. Venet.) translate as if the word were מפּח \[out
of the snare\]. Bertheau prefers this reading, and Bttcher holds חיּד
\[a hunter\] to have fallen out after מיד. It is not a parallelism with
reservation; for a bird-catcher is not at the same time a
gazelle-hunter. The author, if he has so written, has conceived of מיד,
as at [Kg1 20:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#042.md), as absolute, and
connected it with הנּצל: tear thyself free like the gazelle from the
hand into which thou hast fallen (Hitzig); according to which, the
section should be accentuated thus: הנצל כצבי מיד. צבי, Aram. טבי, Arab.
zaby, is the gazelle (Arab. ghazâl), so called from its elegance; צפּור,
the bird, from its whistling (צפר, Arab. ṣafar, R. צף, cf. Arab.
saffârat, the whistling of a bird), Arab. safar, whistler (with
prosthesis, 'aṣafwar, warbler, Psalm. p. 794). The bird-catcher is
called יקושׁ (from יקשׁ, after the form יכל, cog. קושׁ, [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021), נקשׁ, R. קש.md), after the form
בּגוד (fem. בּגודה), or יקוּשׁ; one would think that the Kametz, after
the form kâtwl (vid., under [Isa
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017).md), must here be fixed, but in [Jer
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026.md) the word is vocalized יקוּשׁים.

[Proverbs 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 6:6</span></span>

As Elihu ([Job 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#011).md) says that God
has set the beasts as our teachers, so he sends the sluggard to the
school of the ant (Ameise), so named (in Germ.) from its industry
(Emsigkeit):

6 Go to the ant, sluggard;

Consider her ways, and be wise!

7 She that hath no judge,

Director, and ruler:

8 She prepareth in summer her food,

Has gathered in harvest her store.

The Dech written mostly under the לך separates the inseparable. The
thought, Go to the ant, sluggard! permits no other distinction than in
the vocative; but the Dech of לך אל־נמלה is changed into Munach

(Note: Cod. 1294 accentuates לך אל־נמלה; and that, according to
Ben-Asher's rule, is correct.)

on account of the nature of the Athnach-word, which consists of only two
syllables without the counter-tone. The ant has for its Hebrew-Arabic
name נמלה, from the R. נם (Isaiah, p. 687), which is first used of the
sound, which expresses the idea of the low, dull, secret - thus of its
active and yet unperceived motion; its Aramaic name in the Peshto,
ûmenaa', and in the Targ. שׁוּמשׁמנא (also Arab. sumsum, simsim, of
little red ants), designates it after its quick activity, its busy
running hither and thither (vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chald. Wrterb. ii.
578). She is a model of unwearied and well-planned labour. From the
plur. דּרכיה it is to be concluded that the author observed their art in
gathering in and laying up in store, carrying burdens, building their
houses, and the like (vid., the passages in the Talmud and Midrash in
the Hamburg Real-Encyclopdie fr Bibel und Talmud, 1868, p. 83f.). To the
ant the sluggard (עצל, Aram. and Arab. עטל, with the fundamental idea of
weight and dulness) is sent, to learn from her to be ashamed, and to be
taught wisdom.

[Pro 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#007.md)

This relative clause describes the subject of [Pro
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#008.md) more fully: it is like a clause
with גּם כּי, quamquam.

(Note: [Pro 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#007.md) is commonly halved by
Rebia; but for the correct accentuation, vid., Torath Emeth, p. 48, 3.)

The community of ants exhibits a peculiar class of workers; but it is
not, like that of bees, composed of grades germinating in the queen-bee
as the head. The three offices here named represent the highest
judiciary, police, and executive powers; for קצין (from קצה, to
distinguish, with the ending in, vid., Jesurun, p. 215 s.) is the judge;
שׁטר (from שׁטר, Arab. saṭr, to draw lines, to write) is the overseer
(in war the director, controller), or, as Saalschtz indicates the
province of the schotrim both in cities and in the camp, the office of
police; משׁל (vid., Isaiah, p. 691), the governors of the whole state
organism subordinated to the schoftim and the schotrim. The Syr., and
the Targ. slavishly following it, translate קצין by חצדּא (harvest), for
they interchange this word with קציר.

[Pro 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#008.md)

In this verse the change of the time cannot be occasioned by this, that
קיץ and קציר are distinguished as the earlier and the later period of
the year; for קיץ (= Arab. ḳayt, from ḳât, to be glowing hot, cf. Arab.
kghyyṭ of the glow of the mid-day heat) is the late summer, when the
heat rises to the highest degree; but the son of the Shunammite
succumbed to the sun-stroke in the time of harvest ([Kg2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#018)..md). Lwenstein judiciously remarks
that תּכין refers to immediate want, אנרה to that which is future; or,
better, the former shows them engaged in persevering industry during the
summer glow, the latter as at the end of the harvest, and engaged in the
bringing home of the winter stores. The words of the procuring of food
in summer are again used by Agur, [Pro
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#025.md); and the Aramaic fable of the
ant and the grasshopper,

(Note: Vid., Goldberg's Chofes Matmonim, Berlin 1845; and Landsberger's
Berlin Graduation Thesis, Fabulae aliquot Aramaeae, 1846, p. 28.)

which is also found among those of Aesop and of Syntipas, serves as an
illustration of this whole verse. The lxx has, after the "Go to the
ant," a proverb of five lines, ἢ πορεύθητι πρὸς τὴν μέλισσαν. Hitzig
regards it as of Greek origin; and certainly, as Lagarde has shown, it
contains idiomatic Greek expressions which would not occur to a
translator from the Hebrew. In any case, however, it is an interpolation
which disfigures the Hebrew text by overlading it.

[Proverbs 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 6:9</span></span>

After the poet has admonished the sluggard to take the ant as an
example, he seeks also to rouse him out of his sleepiness and indolence:

9 How long, O sluggard, wilt thou lie?

When wilt thou rise up from thy sleep?

10 "A little sleep, a little slumber,

A little folding of the hands to rest!"

11 So comes like a strong robber thy poverty,

And thy want as an armed man.

[Pro 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#009.md)

The awakening cry, [Pro 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#009.md), is not of
the kind that Paul could have it in his mind, [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014.md). עצל has, as the vocative, Pasek
after it, and is, on account of the Pasek, in correct editions
accentuated not with Munach, but Mercha. The words, [Pro
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010.md), are not an ironical call (sleep
only yet a little while, but in truth a long while), but per mimesin the
reply of the sluggard with which he turns away the unwelcome disturber.
The plurals with מעט sound like self-delusion: yet a little, but a
sufficient! To fold the hands, i.e., to cross them over the breast, or
put them into the bosom, denotes also, [Ecc
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005.md), the idler. חבּוּק, complicatio
(cf. in Livy, compressis quod aiunt manibus sidere; and Lucan, 2:292,
compressas tenuisse manus), for formed like שׁקּוּי, [Pro
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008.md), and the inf. שׁכב like חסר, [Pro
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021.md), and שׁפל, [Pro
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#019.md). The perf. consec. connects
itself with the words heard from the mouth of the sluggard, which are as
a hypothetical antecedent thereto: if thou so sayest, and always again
sayest, then this is the consequence, that suddenly and inevitably
poverty and want come upon thee. That מהלּך denotes the grassator, i.e.,
vagabond (Arab. dawwar, one who wanders much about), or the robber or
foe (like the Arab. 'aduww, properly transgressor finium), is not
justified by the usage of the language; הלך signifies, [Sa2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#004.md), the traveller, and מהלּך is one
who rides quickly forward, not directly a κακὸς ὁδοιπόρος (lxx).

[Pro 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011.md)

The point of comparison, 11a, is the unforeseen, as in quick march or
assault (Bttcher), and 11b the hostile and irretrievable surprise; for a
man in armour, as Hitzig remarks, brings no good in his armour: he
assails the opponent, and he who is without defence yields to him
without the possibility of withstanding him. The lxx translate כאישׁ מגן
by ὥσπερ ἀγαθὸς δρομεύς (cf. δρομεύς = מני־ארג, [Job
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#006), lxx, Aq..md), for what reason we
know not. After [Pro 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011.md) they
interpose two other lines: "but if thou art assiduous, thy harvest will
come to thee as a fountain, but want will go away ὥσπερ κακὸς δρομεύς."
Also this "bad runner" we must let go; for Lagarde's retranslation,
ומחסרך כחשׁ בּאישׁ נמג, no one can understand. The four lines, [Pro
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010.md), [Pro
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011.md) are repeated in the appendix of
Words of the Wise, [Pro 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#033.md).; and if
this appendix originated in the time of Hezekiah, they may have been
taken therefrom by the poet, the editor of the older Book of Proverbs.
Instead of כמהלּך, מתהלך is there used (so comes forward thy poverty,
i.e., again and again, but certainly moving forward); and instead of
מחסרך, מחסריך is written, as also here, [Pro
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006.md), for משׁנתך is found the variant
משׁנתיך with Jod as mater lectionis of the pausal Segol.

[Proverbs 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 6:12</span></span>

There follows now a third brief series of instructions, which run to a
conclusion with a deterring prospect similar to the foregoing.

12 A worthless man, a wicked man,

Is he who practiseth falsehood with his mouth;

13 Who winketh with his eyes, scrapeth with his foot,

Pointeth with his fingers.

14 Malice is in his heart,

He deviseth evil at all times,

He spreadeth strife.

15 Therefore suddenly his destruction shall come,

Suddenly shall he be destroyed, and there is no remedy.

It is a question, what is the subject and what the predicate in [Pro
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012.md). Thus much is clear, that upon
him who is here described according to his deceitful conduct the
sentence of condemnation shall fall. He who is so described is thus
subject, and אדם בּליּעל is without doubt predicate. But does the
complex subject begin with אישׁ און? Thus e.g., Hitzig: "A worthless man
is the wicked man who...." But the interchange of עדם and אישׁ is a sign
of parallel relation; and if 12b belonged attributively to אישׁ און,
then since אישׁ האון is not used, it ought at least to have been
continued by ההולך. The general moral categories, 12a, are thus
predicates, as was indeed besides probable; the copious division of the
subject demands also in point of style a more developed predicate. [Pro
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#027.md) is simpler in plan, and also
logically different. There the expression is, as is usual, אישׁ בליעל.
Since אדם און is not possible, the author uses instead בליעל. This word,
composed of בּלי and יעל (from יעל, ועל, to be useful, to be good for),
so fully serves as one word, that it even takes the article, [Sa1
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#025.md). It denotes worthlessness,
generally in a chain of words in the genitive, but also the worthless,
[Job 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#018.md); and it is to be so taken
here, for אדם does not form a constructivus, and never governs a
genitive. בליעל is thus a virtual adjective (as nequam in homo nequam);
the connection is like that of אדם רשׁע, [Pro
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#007.md), and elsewhere, although more
appositional than this pure attributive. Synonymous with בליעל is און
(from an, to breathe), wickedness, i.e., want of all moral character.
Thus worthless and wicked is he who practises deceit with his mouth (cf.
[Pro 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#024).md), i.e., who makes language
the means of untruthfulness and uncharitableness. עקּשׁוּת פּה is meant
in a moral sense, but without excluding that distortion of the mouth
which belongs to the mimicry of the malicious. It is the accus. of the
object; for הלך is also bound in a moral sense with the accusative of
that which one practises, i.e., dealing with, exercises himself in, [Pro
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007.md); [Pro
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#018.md), [Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md).

[Pro 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013.md)

קורץ בּעיניו is translated according to the sense: who winks (nictat)
with his eyes; but that is not the proper meaning of the word, for קרץ
is used not only of the eyes. [Pro
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010.md) (cf. [Pro
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#030.md), qui oculos morsicat or
connivet), [Psa 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md), but also of the
lips, [Pro 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#030.md). Thus Lwenstein's
explanation: who opens up the eyes, is incorrect. The verb קרץ unites in
it the meanings of Arab. qrts, to pinch off with a sharp implement, and
Arab. qrd, with a blunt instrument (Arab. miḳraḍ, pincers). It means to
pince, to nip, as Arab. ḳarṣ, pincer - e.g., ḳarṣ balskyn alarsasat, he
cuts off with the knife the leaden seal - hence frequently, to nip
together the eyes, provincially: to wink ("zwickern," frequent. of
"zwicken," to nip) with the eyes - the action of the deceiver, who
thereby gives the sign to others that they help or at least do not
hinder him from bantering and mocking, belying and deceiving a third
person (Fl.); cf. Ali's proverb, "O God, pardon to us the culpable
winking with the eye (ramzat)," and Fleischer's notes thereon, the
Proverbs of Ali, p. 100f.

That the words which follow, בּרגליו מולל, are meant of discourse, i.e.,
the giving of signs, with the feet, and, so to say, significant oratio
pedestris (lxx, Aben-Ezra, Bertheau, Hitzig, and others), is very
improbable, since the usage of language has set apart the Piel מלּל for
the meaning loqui, and מולל admits another suitable signification, for
מולל means in Talmudic fricare, confricare - e.g., המולל מלילות, he who
grinds the parched ears of corn (b. Beza 12b; Ma'seroth, iv. 5) - after
which Syr., Targ., תכס (stamping), Aq. τρίβων, Symm. προστρίβων, Jerome,
(qui) terit pede, and Rashi משׁפשׁף (grinding, scratching); it means one
who scrapes with his feet, draws them backwards and forwards on the
ground in order thereby to give a sign to others; also the Arab. mll,
levem et agilem esse, which as the synonym of Arab. sr is connected with
Arab. fı̂ of the way, signifies properly to move the feet quickly hither
and thither (Fl.).

(Note: The root-idea of the Arab. mall is unquietness of motion; the
Arab. noun mallt signifies the glow with its flickering light and
burning: glowing ashes, inner agitation, external haste; Arab. malil
(מלל) is the feverish patient, but also one quickly hastening away, and
generally an impatient or hasty person (vid., Wetstein in Baudissin in
his Job. Tischendorfianus, vii. 6). The grinding is made by means of a
quick movement hither and thither; and so also is speaking, for the
instrument of speech, particularly the tongue, is set in motion. Only
the meaning praecidere, circumcidere, does not connect itself with that
root-idea: מל in this signification appears to be a nance of מר,
stringere.)

מרה appears here, in accordance with its primary signification
(projicere, sc. brachium or digitum = monstrare), connected with
בּעצבּעתיו; another expression for this scornful, malicious
δακτυλοδεικνεῖν is שׁלח אצבּע, [Isa
58:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#009.md).

[Pro 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#014.md)

In this verse is continued the description of the subject, only once
returning to the particip. The clauses are arranged independently, but
logically according to the complex conception of the subject. תּהפּכות
.tce are just the knaveries, i.e., the malicious wickedness which comes
to light in word and deportment as עקשׁות פה. Regarding the double
figure of the smithy and of agriculture underlying חרשׁ, machinari,
vid., at [Pro 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029.md), and regarding the
omission of the הוּא to חרשׁ, at [Psa
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010.md). The phrase שׁלּח מדנים (as [Pro
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019.md), [Pro
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#028).md), to let loose disputes, so that
they break forth, reminds us rather of the unfettering of the winds by
Aeolus than of the casting in of the apple of discord. Instead of מדנים
the Kerı̂ has מדינים; on the other hand, מדנים remains uncorrected [Pro
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019.md); [Pro
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md). The form מדינים occurs once,
[Pro 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018.md), and its constr. מדיני
once, [Pro 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013.md). Everywhere else the
text has מדונים, for which the Kerı̂ has מדינים, [Pro
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019.md); [Pro
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009.md), [Pro
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#019.md); [Pro
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#029.md); [Pro
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#024.md); [Pro
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#021.md); [Pro
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015.md). The forms מדין and מדן are also
recognised: the former stands alone without any analogous example; the
latter is compared at least with מצד, Arab. masâd (Psalmen, p. 163, 3).
Probably these two forms are warranted by [Gen
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002.md), cf. [Gen
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#028.md), [Gen
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036.md), where מדין and מדן occur as the
names of two sons of Abraham by Keturah. But the national name מדינים is
no reason for the seven times laying aside of the regular form מדונים,
i.e., מדונים, which is the plur. of מדון after the forms מאורים, מעורים,
although מדוּנים, after the forms מבוּשׁים, מצוּקים, is also found.

[Pro 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#015.md)

With the 14th verse the description terminates. A worthless and a wicked
person is he who does such things. The point lies in the characteristic
out of which the conclusion is drawn: therefore his ruin will suddenly
come upon him, etc. Regarding איד, the root-meaning of which is
illustrated by [Amo 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#013.md), vid., at
[Pro 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026.md). פּתאם is an old accus. of
an absol. פּתא, of the same meaning as פּתע, used as an adverbial
accus., both originating in the root-idea of splitting, opening,
breaking out and breaking forth. "Shall be broken to pieces" (as a
brittle potter's vessel, [Psa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md);
[Isa 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014.md); [Jer
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011).md) is a frequent figure for the
destruction (שׁבר) of an army (cf. Arab. ânksar âljysh), of a city or a
state, a man. ואין continues the ישּׁבר as [Pro
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001.md) : there shall be as it were no
means of recovery for his shattered members (Fl.). Without the Vav this
אין מרפּא would be a clause conceived of accusatively, and thus
adverbially: without any healing.

[Proverbs 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 6:16</span></span>

What now follows is not a separate section (Hitzig), but the
corroborative continuation of that which precedes. The last word (מדנים,
strife) before the threatening of punishment, 14b, is also here the
last. The thought that no vice is a greater abomination to God than the
(in fact satanical) striving to set men at variance who love one
another, clothes itself in the form of the numerical proverb which we
have already considered, pp. 12, 13. From that place we transfer the
translation of this example of a Midda: -

16 There are six things which Jahve hateth,

And seven are an abhorrence to His soul:

17 Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,

And hands that shed innocent blood;

18 An heart that deviseth the thoughts of evil,

Feet that hastily run to wickedness,

19 One that uttereth lies as a false witness,

And he who soweth strife between brethren.

The sense is not, that the six things are hateful to God, and the
seventh an abomination to Him besides (Lwenstein); the Midda-form in
Amos 1:3-2:6, and in the proverb in [Job
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md), shows that the seven are to be
numbered separately, and the seventh is the non plus ultra of all that
is hated by God. We are not to translate: sex haecce odit, for המּה,
הנּה, (הם, הן) points backwards and hitherwards, but not, as אלּה,
forwards to that immediately following; in that case the words would be
שׁשׁ אלה, or more correctly האלה שׁשׁ. But also Hitzig's explanation,
"These six things (viz., [Pro 6:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012).md)
Jahve hateth," is impossible; for (which is also against that haecce)
the substantive pronoun המה nuonorp , הנה (ההמה, ההנה) is never, like
the Chald. המּון (המּו), employed as an accus. in the sense of אתהם,
אתהן, it is always (except where it is the virtual gen. connected with a
preposition) only the nom., whether of the subject or of the predicate;
and where it is the nom. of the predicate, as [Deu
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#015.md); [Isa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019.md), substantival clauses precede in
which הנה (המה) represents the substantive verb, or, more correctly, in
which the logical copula resulting from the connection of the clause
itself remains unexpressed. Accordingly, 'שׂנא ה is a relative clause,
and is therefore so accentuated here, as at [Pro
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015) and elsewhere: sex (sunt.md) ea
quae Deus odit, et septem (sunt) abominatio animae ejus. Regarding the
statement that the soul of God hates anything, vid., at [Isa
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014.md). תועבות, an error in the writing
occasioned by the numeral (vid., [Pro
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#025).md), is properly corrected by the
Kerı̂; the poet had certainly the singular in view, as [Pro
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032.md); [Pro
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001.md), when he wrote תועבת. The first
three characteristics are related to each other as mental, verbal,
actual, denoted by the members of the body by means of which these
characteristics come to light. The virtues are taken all together as a
body (organism), and meekness is its head. Therefore there stands above
all, as the sin of sins, the mentis elatae tumor, which expresses itself
in elatum (grande) supercilium: עינים רמות, the feature of the רם,
haughty (cf. [Psa 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md) with [Sa2
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#028).md), is the opposite of the feature
of the שׁח עינים, [Job 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029.md); עין is
in the O.T. almost always (vid., [Sol
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009).md) fem., and adjectives of course
form no dual. The second of these characteristics is the lying tongue,
and the third the murderous hands. דּם־נקי is innocent blood as
distinguished from דּם הנּקי, the blood of the innocent, [Deu
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#013.md).

(Note: The writing דּם follows the Masoretic rule, vid., Kimchi, Michlol
205b, and Heidenheim under [Deu 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#010.md),
where in printed editions of the text (also in Norzi's) the irregular
form דּם נקי is found. Besides, the Metheg is to be given to דּם־, so
that one may not read it dom, as e.g., שׁשׁ־מאות, [Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011), that one may not read it שׁשׁ־..md)

[Pro 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#018.md)

The fourth characteristic is a deceitful heart. On חרשׁ, vid., [Pro
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#014.md), [Pro
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029.md), and on אין, [Pro
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012.md). The fifth: feet running with
haste to evil; לרעה as לרע in [Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md), echoing the distich [Pro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md), as here, 17b and 18b. The
connection מהר לרוּץ, propere cucurrit (contrast אחר ל), is equivalent
to רץ מהר.

[Pro 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019.md)

The sixth: "A speaker of lies, a tongue of falsehood," is hateful to
God. It is one subject which is thus doubly characterized. כּזבים are
fictions, and שׁקר is the disfiguring (deformatio) of the actual facts.
They are purposely placed together in this connection. The derivations
of these synonyms are obscure; Frst gives to the former the root-idea of
spinning (properly knotting together), and to the latter that of
painting. כזבים is introduced to support שׁקר.

(Note: Isaak Albo thus distinguishes these synonyms in his dogmatic,
bearing the title ספר עקרים, ii. 27.)

It would also be verbally permissible to interpret עד שׁקר in the sense
of עדוּת שׁקר, like [Pro 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#018.md), as in
apposition to כזבים; but in the nearest parallel, [Pro
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#015.md), the idea is personal, for it is
said of the עד שׁקר that he breathes out lies. In that place there can
be no doubt that the clause is a verbal one, and יפיח finitum, viz.,
Hiph. of פּוּח. This Hiph. signifies elsewhere also sufflare, [Pro
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008.md), afflare, [Psa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#005.md); [Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md), perflare, [Sol
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016), anhelare (desiderare.md), [Psa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006.md); [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md), but with כזבים, efflare, a
synonym to דּבּר, as הבּיע and הטּיף, which has (cf. [Pro
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#017).md) no secondary meaning in use,
but is mostly connected with כזבים, not without reference to the fact
that that which is false is without reality and is nothing more than הבל
ורוח. But what kind of a form is יפיח, where it is not, as [Pro
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005.md), the predicate of a verbal
clause, but in connection with כזבים, as here and at [Pro
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025.md); [Pro
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005.md), [Pro
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009.md) (once with אמונה, [Pro
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#017).md), is the subject of a
substantival clause? That which lies nearest is to regard it as a noun
formed from the fut. Hiph. Such formations we indeed meet only among
proper names, such as יאיר, יכין, יקים; however, at least the one n.
appell. יריב (an adversary) is found, which may be formed from the Hiph.
as well as from the Kal. But should not the constr. of יפיח after the
form יריב be יפיח? One does not escape from this consideration by
deriving יפיח, after the forms יגיע, יחיל, ידיד, ישׁישׁ, and the like,
from a secondary verb יפח, the existence of which is confirmed by [Jer
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md), and from which also יפח, [Psa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md), appears to be derived, although
it may be reduced also, after the form ירב (with יריב), to הפיח. But in
this case also one expects as a connecting form יפיח like ידיד, as in
reality יפח from יפח (cf. אבל, שׂמהי, from אבל, שׂמח). Shall it now be
assumed that the Kametz is treated as fixed? This were contrary to rule,
since it is not naturally long. Thus the connection is not that of the
genitive. But if יפיח were a substantive formed with the preformative of
the second modus like ילקוּט [Sa1
17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040.md), or were it a participial
intensive form of active signification such as נביא, then the verbal
force remaining in it is opposed to the usage of the language. There
remains nothing further, therefore, than to regard יפיח as an
attributive put in the place of a noun: one who breathes out; and there
is a homogeneous example of this, for in any other way we cannot explain
יוסיף, [Ecc 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#018.md). In 19b the numeral
proverb reaches its point. The chief of all that God hates is he who
takes a fiendish delight in setting at variance men who stand nearly
related. Thus this brief proverbial discourse rounds itself off, coming
again to 14b as a refrain.

[Proverbs 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 6:20</span></span>

After these three smaller sections, the teacher of wisdom returns here
to the theme of the eighth: Warning against sins of the flesh, whose
power and prevalence among men is so immeasurably great, that their
terrible consequences cannot sufficiently be held up before them,
particularly before youth.

20 Keep, my son, the commandment of thy father,

And reject not the instruction of thy mother.

21 Bind them to thy heart evermore,

Fasten them about thy neck.

The suff. -ēm refers to the good doctrine (cf. [Pro
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#003).md) pointed out by מצוה and תּורה;
the masc. stands, as is usual (e.g., [Pro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md); [Pro
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002).md), instead of the fem. Regarding
the figure, reminding us of the Tefillin and of Amuletes for perpetual
representation, vid., under [Pro 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md).
Similarly of persons, [Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md). The
verb ענד (only here and [Job 31:36](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#036).md)
signifies to bend, particularly to bend aside (Arab. 'ind, bending off,
going aside; accus. as adv., aside, apud), and to bend up, to wind
about, circumplicare.

[Proverbs 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 6:22</span></span>

The representation of the good doctrine is now personified, and becomes
identified with it.

When thou walkest, it will guide thee;

When thou liest down, it will keep watch over thee;

And when thou wakest, it will talk with thee.

The subject is the doctrine of wisdom, with which the representation of
wisdom herself is identified. The futures are not expressive of a wish
or of an admonition, but of a promise; the form of the third clause
shows this. Thus, and in the same succession as in the schema [Deu
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md), cf. [Pro
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#019.md), are the three circumstances of
the outward life distinguished: going, lying down, and rising up. The
punctuation בּהתהלכך, found here and there, is Ben-Naphtali's variant;
Ben-Asher and also the Textus rec. reject the Metheg in this case, vid.,
Baer's Metheg-Setzung, 28. The verb נחה, with its Hiph. in a
strengthened Kal-signification, is more frequently found in the Psalms
than in the Proverbs; the Arab. nh' shows that it properly signifies to
direct (dirigere), to give direction, to move in a definite direction.
שׁמר with על, to take into protection, we had already [Pro
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#011.md); this author has favourite forms
of expression, in the repetition of which he takes delight. With lying
down, sleeping is associated. והקיצות is, as [Psa
139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018.md), the hypoth. perf., according
to Ewald, 357a: et ut expergefactus es, illa te compellabit. Bertheau
incorrectly: she will make thee thoughtful. But apart from the fact that
there is no evidence of the existence of this Hiph. in the language of
the Bible, the personification demands a clearer figure. שׂיח (שׂוּח)
signifies mental speech and audible speech ([Gen
24:63](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#063.md), poet., in the Talmudic

(Note: The conjecture thrown out by Wetstein, that (Arab.) shykh is
equivalent to משׂיח (מסיח), speaker, is untenable, since the verb shakh,
to be old, a so-called munsarif, i.e., conjugated throughout, is used in
all forms, and thus is certainly the root of the shykh.)

a common word); with ב, speaking concerning something (fabulari de),
[Psa 69:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#013.md); with the accus., that
which is said of a thing, [Psa 145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005.md),
or the address, briefly for שׂיח ל, [Job
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#008.md) (as מגּן with accus. [Pro
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#009) = מגן ל.md): when thou art awake,
wisdom will forthwith enter into conversation with thee, and fill thy
thoughts with right matter, and give to thy hands the right direction
and consecration.

[Proverbs 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 6:23</span></span>

Since in היא the idea of wisdom and of wholesome doctrine lie in one
another, the author can proceed with proof:

For a lamp is the commandment, and instruction a light (Jerome et lex
lux);

And a way of life, disciplinary reproofs.

That תורה has here not the positive, specifically Israelitish sense, but
the generalized sense of instruction in conformity with truth regarding
the will of God and the duty of man, vid., p. 42. This instruction
mediated by man, but of divine origin, is אור, light, which enlightens
the man who submits to it; and the commandment, מצוה, which directs men
in every case to do what is right, and forbids that which is wrong
(including the prohibition [Lev 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002).md),
is נר, a lamp which, kindled at that light, enlightens all the darkness
of ignorance with reference to human conduct and its consequences. אור
and נר are related to each other as general and particular, primary and
derivative. Lwenstein accentuates incorrectly תּורהו אור instead of
תּורהו אור (as the Cod. 1294 and the 3 Erfurt Codd.); vid., on the
retrogression of the tone, not existing here, under [Pro
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015.md). The gen. מוּסר denotes the
object or character of the admonition: not disciplinary in the external
sense of the word, but rather moral, having in view discipline in the
sense of education, i.e., moral edification and elevation. Such
corrections are דּרך חיּים, the way to true life, direction how to
obtain it.

[Proverbs 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 6:24</span></span>

The section thus closes:

To keep thee from the vile woman,

From the flattery of the strange tongue.

Regarding the genitive connection אושׁת רע, a woman of a wicked
character, vid., under [Pro 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#014.md); and
regarding the adjectival connection לשׁון נכריה, under [Pro

(לשׁון) of the strange (foreign) woman (vid., p. 81), alluring with
smooth words ([Pro 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016).md). Ewald,
Bertheau: from her of a smooth tongue, the stranger, as Symm., Theod.,
ἀπὸ λειογλώσσου ξένης; but חלקת is a substantive ([Gen
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#016).md), and as a fem. adject. form is
without an example. Rather חלקת לשׁון is to be regarded as the first
member and נכריה as the second of the st. constr., for the former
constitutes one idea, and לשון on this account remains unabbreviated;
cf. [Psa 68:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#022.md); [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001); but (1.md) this syntactical
phenomenon is yet problematical, vid., Friedr. Philippi, Wesen und
Ursprung des St. Constr. p. 17; and (2) the supposition of such an
anomaly is here unnecessary.

[Proverbs 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 6:25</span></span>

The proaemium of these twelve proverbial discourses is now at an end.
Wisdom herself begins striking the note of the Decalogue:

25 Long not for her beauty in thy heart,

And let her not catch thee with her eyelids;

26 Because for a harlot one cometh down to a piece of bread,

And a man's wife lieth in wait for a precious soul.

The warning 25a is in the spirit of the "thou shalt not covet," [Exo
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#017.md), and the ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὑτοῦ,
[Mat 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028.md), of the Preacher on the
Mount. The Talmudic proverb הרהודי עבירה קשו מעבירה (Joma 29a) means
only that the imagination of the sinful act exhausts the body even more
than the act itself. The warning, "let her not catch thee with her
eyelids," refers to her (the adulteress's) coquettish ogling and amorous
winking. In the reason added, beginning with כּי בעד־ (thus it is to be
punctuated), there is the appositional connection אשּׁה זונה, Gesen.
113; the idea of זונה goes over into 26b. "לחם כּכּר \[ = כּרכּר, R. kr,
to round, vid., at [Gen 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#005.md)\],
properly a circle of bread, is a small round piece of bread, such as is
still baked in Italy (pagnotta) and in the East (Arab. ḳurṣ), here an
expression for the smallest piece" (Fl.). בּעד (constr. of בּעד), as
[Job 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004.md); [Isa
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#014.md), is used in the sense of ὑπέρ,
pro, and with עד there is connected the idea of the coming down to this
low point. Ewald, Bertheau explain after the lxx, τιμὴ γὰρ πόρνης ὅση
καὶ ἑνὸς ἄρτου, γυνὴ δὲ ἀνδρῶν τιμίας ψυχὰς ἀγρεύει. But nothing is said
here of price (reward); the parallelism is synonymous, not antithetic:
he is doubly threatened with loss who enters upon such a course. The
adulterer squanders his means ([Pro
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#003).md) to impoverishment (vid., the
mention of a loaf of bread in the description of poverty [Sa1
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#036).md), and a man's wife (but at the
same time seeking converse with another) makes a prey of a precious
soul; for whoever consents to adulterous converse with her, loses not
perhaps his means, but certainly freedom, purity, dignity of soul, yea,
his own person. צוּד comprehends - as צידון, fisher's town \[Zidon\],
Arab. ṣyâd, hunter and fisher, show - all kinds of hunting, but in Hebr.
is used only of the hunting of wild beasts. The root-meaning (cf. צדיּה)
is to spy, to seize.

[Proverbs 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 6:27</span></span>

The moral necessity of ruinous consequences which the sin of adultery
draws after it, is illustrated by examples of natural cause and effect
necessarily connected:

27 Can one take fire in his bosom

And his clothes not be burned?

28 Or can any one walk over burning coals

And his feet not be burned?

29 So he that goeth to his neighbour's wife,

No one remains unpunished that toucheth her.

We would say: Can any one, without being, etc.; the former is the
Semitic "extended (paratactic)

(Note: The παρατακτικὸς χρόνος denotes the imperfect tense, because it
is still extended to the future.)

construction." The first אישׁ has the conjunctive Shalsheleth. חתה
signifies to seize and draw forth a brand or coal with the fire-tongs or
shovel (מחתּה, the instrument for this); cf. Arab. khât, according to
Lane, "he seized or snatched away a thing;" the form יחתּה is Kal, as
יחנה (vid., Khler, De Tetragammate, 1867, p. 10). חיק (properly
indentation) is here not the lap, but, as [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md), the bosom.

[Pro 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#028.md)

A second example of destructive consequences naturally following a
certain course is introduced with אם of the double question. גּחלים
(from גּחל, after the form פּחם, but for which גּחלת is used) is the
regular modification of gaḥḥalı̂m (Gesen. 27, 2). The fem. ורגליו is
followed here (cf. on the other hand [Pro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016).md) by the rhythmically
full-sounding form תכּוינה (retaining the distinction of gender), from
כּוה, Arab. kwy, to burn so that a brand-mark (כּי, [Isa
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024), cauterium.md) remains.

[Pro 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#029.md)

The instruction contained in these examples here follows: τὸ εἰς πῦρ καὶ
εἰς γυναῖκα ἐμπεσεῖν Ἴσον ὑπάρχει (Pythagoras in Maximi Eclog. c. 39).
בּוא אל is here, as the second in [Psa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md), a euphemism, and נגע בּ, to come
in contact with, means, as נגע אל, to touch, [Gen
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#006.md). He who goes in to his
neighbour's wife shall not do so with impunity (נקי). Since both
expressions denote fleshly nearness and contact, so it is evident he is
not guiltless.

[Proverbs 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 6:30</span></span>

The thief and the adulterer are now placed in comparison with one
another, in such a way that adultery is supposed to be a yet greater
crime.

30 One does not treat the thief scornfully if he steals

To satisfy his craving when he is hungry;

31 Being seized, he may restore sevenfold,

Give up the whole wealth of his house.

For the most part 30a is explained: even when this is the case, one does
not pass it over in the thief as a bagatelle. Ewald remarks: בּוּז ל
stands here in its nearest signification of overlooking, whence first
follows that of contemning. But this "nearest" signification is devised
wholly in favour of this passage; - the interpretation, "they do not
thus let the thief pass," is set aside by [Sol
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#001.md), [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md); for by 31b, cf. [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md), and 34a, cf. [Sol
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md), it is proved that from [Pro
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030.md) on, reminiscences from the
Canticles, which belong to the literature of the Chokma, find their way
into the Mashal language of the author. Hitzig's correct supposition,
that בּוּז ל always signifies positive contemning, does not necessitate
the interrogative interpretation: "Does not one despise the thief
if...?" Thus to be understood, the author ought to have written אף כי or
גם כי. Michaelis rightly: furtum licet merito pro infami in republica
habetur, tamen si cum adulterio comparatur, minus probrosum est.
Regarding נפשׁ in the sense of appetite, and even throat and stomach,
vid., Psychologie, p. 204. A second is, that the thief, if he is seized
(but we regard ונמצא not as the hypoth. perf., but as the part.
deprehensus), may make compensation for this crime. The fut. ישׁלּם thus
to be understood as the potential lies near from this, that a sevenfold
compensation of the thing stolen is unheard of in the Israelitish law;
it knows only of a twofold, fourfold, fivefold restoration, Ex. 21:37;
[Exo 22:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md), [Exo
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#008.md) (cf. Saalschtz, Mos. Recht, p.
554ff.). This excess over that which the law rendered necessary leads
into the region of free-will: he (the thief, by which we are now only to
think of him whom bitter necessity has made such) may make compensation
sevenfold, i.e., superabundantly; he may give up the whole possessions
(vid., on הון at [Pro 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#013).md) of his
house, so as not merely to satisfy the law, but to appease him against
whom he has done wrong, and again to gain for himself an honoured name.
What is said in [Pro 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030.md) and [Pro
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#031.md) is perfectly just. One does not
contemn a man who is a thief through poverty, he is pitied; while the
adulterer goes to ruin under all circumstances of contempt and scorn.
And: theft may be made good, and that abundantly; but adultery and its
consequences are irreparable.

[Proverbs 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 6:32</span></span>

Here there is a contrast stated to [Pro
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030.md) :

32 He who commits adultery (adulterans mulierem) is beside himself,

A self-destroyer-who does this.

33 He gains stripes and disgrace,

And his reproach is never quenched.

נאף, which primarily seems to mean excedere, to indulge in excess, is,
as also in the Decalogue, cf. [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md), transitive: ὁ μοιχεύων γυναῖκα.
Regarding being mad (herzlos = heartless) = amens (excors, vecors),
vid., Psychologie, p. 254. משׁחית נפשׁו is he who goes to ruin with
wilful perversity. A self-murderer - i.e., he intends to ruin his
position and his prosperity in life - who does it, viz., this, that he
touches the wife of another. It is the worst and most inextinguishable
dishonouring of oneself. Singularly Behaji: who annihilates it (his
soul), with reference to [Deu 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#012.md).
Eccl. 4:17, where עשׂה would be equivalent to בּטּל, καταργεῖν, which is
untrue and impossible.

(Note: Behaji ought rather to have referred to [Zep
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019.md); [Eze
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#027.md); [Eze
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#014.md); but there עשׂה את means agere
cum aliquo, as we say: mit jemandem abrechnen (to settle accounts with
any one).)

נגע refers to the corporal punishment inflicted on the adulterer by the
husband ([Deu 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md); [Deu
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#005).md); Hitzig, who rejects [Pro
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#032.md), refers it to the stripes which
were given to the thief according to the law, but these would be called
מכּה (מכּות). The punctuation נגע־וקלון is to be exchanged for קלונו נגע
(Lwenstein and other good editors). מצא has a more active signification
than our "finden" (to find): consequitur, τυγχάνει.

[Proverbs 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">pro 6:34</span></span>

One who has been stolen from is to be appeased, but not the injured
husband.

34 For jealousy is the fury of a husband,

And he spareth not in the day of vengeance.

35 He regardeth not any ransom,

And is not contented though thou offerest to him gifts ever so great.

The connection marks קנאה as the subject; for it respects carnal
intercourse with another's wife. Jealousy is not usually חמה, the glow
of anger (from יחם, as שׁנה from ישׁן), but חמת־גּבר (constr. as שׂנת),
the glow of a man's anger, who with the putting forth of all his manly
strength will seek satisfaction to his wounded honour. גּבר, here
significant for אישׁ, with the fundamental idea of strength, firmness;
cf. Arab. jabr, to make fast, to put right again something broken in
pieces, particularly a broken vessel, hence Algebra, properly the
operation by which an incomplete magnitude is completed (Fl.). The
following ולא־יחמּל (with the orthophonic Dagesh, as [Pro
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025) יחמּד, and with Makkeph.md) is
connected with גבר, with definite reference to the man whom the
faithless guest has made a cuckold. When the day comes in which the
adultery brought to light demands and admits of vengeance, then, wounded
in his right and in his honour, he knows no mercy; he pays no regard to
any atonement or recompense by which the adulterer seeks to appease him
and induce him not to inflict the punishment that is due: he does not
consent, even though thou makest ever so great the gift whereby thou
thinkest to gain him. The phrase נשׂא פנים, πρόσωπον λαμβάνειν,
signifies elsewhere to receive the countenance, i.e., the appearance and
the impression of a man, i.e., to let it impress one favourably; here it
is used of the כּפר, i.e., the means by which covering, i.e.,
non-punishment, pardon of the crime, impunity of the guilty, is
obtained. Regarding אבה, to consent to, vid., at [Pro
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010.md). שׂחד, Aram. שׂוּחד, is a gift,
particularly bribery. That the language may again finally assume the
form of an address, it beautifully rounds itself off.
