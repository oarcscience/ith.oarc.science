Inheritance of the Tribe of Joseph - Joshua 16-17

The descendants of Joseph drew one lot, that the inheritance of the half
tribe of Manasseh might not be separated from that of the tribe of
Ephraim. But the territory was immediately divided between the two
separate tribes of the children of Joseph, Ephraim receiving the
southern portion of the land that had fallen to it by lot, and half
Manasseh the northern. Accordingly we find the southern boundary of the
whole territory described first of all in [Jos
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001), both the boundary which
separated it from the tribe of Benjamin ([Jos
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#011).), and that which divided it
from Dan ([Jos 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#040).); then the
territory of Ephraim is given, with a minute description of the northern
boundary ([Jos 16:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005)); and finally
the territory assigned to the families of Manasseh ([Jos
17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001)), without any precise
delineation of its northern boundaries, all that is stated being that
the Manassites touched Asher and Issachar towards the north, and also
received some scattered towns with their villages in the territory of
both those tribes ([Jos 17:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010)). To
this there is appended in vv. 14-18 the complaint of the children of
Joseph concerning the inheritance that had fallen to them.

[Joshua 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 16:1</span></span>

Territory of the tribe of Joseph. - [Jos
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001). "And there came out the lot of
the children of Joseph from Jordan by Jericho." "The lot came out,"
viz., from the turn (cf. [Jos 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001),
[Jos 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#017), [Jos
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#024)). The expression "came up" is
used in the same sense in [Jos 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#011).
The connection of these two words with the rest of the sentence, "from
Jordan by Jericho," may be explained on the supposition that the lot
which came out of the urn determined the inheritance that fell to the
tribe, so that we might paraphrase the verse in this manner: "There came
out the lot to the children of Joseph, namely, the inheritance, which
goes out from, or whose boundary commences at, the Jordan by Jericho,"
i.e., from that part of the Jordan which is opposite to Jericho, and
which is still more precisely defined by the additional clause, "by the
water of Jericho eastward." The water of Jericho is the present fountain
of es Sultan, half an hour to the north-west of Riha, the only large
fountain in the neighbourhood of Jericho, whose waters spread over the
plain, and form a small brook, which no doubt flows in the rainy season
through the Wady Kelt into the Jordan (see Rob. ii. pp. 283-4; Tobler,
Topogr. v. Jerus. ii. pp. 558-9). "The wilderness" is in opposition to
"the lot," so that the sense is, "namely, the desert going up from
Jericho to the mountains to Bethel." According to [Jos
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#012), the reference is to the desert
of Beth-aven, which was on the east of Bethel, between the Wady Suwar
(Tuwar) and Mutyah (see at [Jos 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002)).
Towards the east this desert terminates with the Jebel Kuruntul
(Quarantana) on the north-west of Jericho, where it descends
precipitously into the valley of the Jordan, or v. v., where it rises
out of the Jordan valley. According to [Jos
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#012), the same boundary went up by
the shoulder of Jericho towards the north, i.e., along the northern
range of mountains by Jericho, which cannot be any other than the
"conspicuous double height, or rather group of heights," in front of the
mountain of Quarantana, at the eastern foot of which lies the fountain
of Ain es Sultan (Rob. ii. p. 284). In all probability, therefore, the
boundary ran up towards the north-west, from the Sultan fountain to Ain
Duk, and thence in a westerly direction across to Abu Seba (along which
road Robinson had a frightful desert on his right hand: Pal. ii. p.
310), and then again towards the north-west to Beitin (Bethel),
according to [Jos 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013), along the
southern shoulder (or side) of Luz, i.e., Bethel.

[Jos 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002)

"And it went out from Bethel to Luz." Bethel is distinguished from Luz
in this passage, because the reference is not to the town of Bethel,
which was called Luz by the Canaanites (vid., [Gen
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019)), but to the southern range of
mountains belonging to Bethel, from which the boundary ran out to the
town of Luz, so that this town, which stood upon the border, was
allotted to the tribe of Benjamin ([Jos
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#022)). From this point the boundary
went over "to the territory of the Arkite to Ataroth," We know nothing
further about the Arkite than that David's friend Hushai belonged to
that family ([Sa2 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032); [Sa2
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#016); [Ch1
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#033)). Ataroth, called Ataroth-Adar
in [Jos 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013), was not the present
village of Atra, an hour and a half to the south of Jiljilia (Rob. iii.
p. 80), as I once supposed, but the ruins of Atra, three-quarters of an
hour to the south of Bireh (Beeroth, Rob. ii. p. 314), with which the
expression "descended" in [Jos 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013)
perfectly harmonizes. Consequently the boundary was first of all drawn
in a south-westerly direction from Beitin to Bireh ([Jos
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025)), and then southwards to Atrah.

[Jos 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003)

From this point "it went down westward to the territory of the
Japhletites to the territory of lower Beth-horon," or, according to [Jos
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013), "to the mountain (or range)
which is on the south by lower Beth-horon." The Japhletite is altogether
unknown as the Asherite of this name cannot possibly be thought of ([Ch1
7:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#032)). Lower Beth-horon is the
present Beit-Ur Tachta, a village upon a low ridge. It is separated from
Upper Beth-horon, which lies farther east, by a deep wady (see at [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010), and Rob. iii. p. 59). "And to
Gezer," which was probably situated near the village of el Kubab (see at
[Jos 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033)). "And the goings out
thereof are at the sea" (the Mediterranean), probably running towards
the north-west, and following the Wady Muzeireh to the north of Japho,
which was assigned to the Danites, according to [Jos
19:46](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#046).

[Jos 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#004)

The territory commencing at the boundary lines mentioned was allotted to
Ephraim and Manasseh as their inheritance.

[Joshua 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 16:5</span></span>

Territory of the tribe of Ephraim, according to its families. - [Jos
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005). "The border of their inheritance
was from the east Atroth-addar and (along the line) to Upper
Beth-horon," - a brief description of the southern boundary, which is
more minutely described in [Jos
16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001). Upper Beth-horon is mentioned
here instead of Lower Beth-horon ([Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003)). This makes no difference,
however, as the two places stood quite close to one another (see at [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010)). In [Jos
16:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006) the northern boundary of
Ephraim is given, namely, from the middle, or from "a central point near
the watershed" (Knobel), first towards the east ([Jos
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006) and [Jos
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007)), and then towards the west ([Jos
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008)). The eastern half of the
northern boundary went ימּה, i.e., when regarded from the west, or
looked at towards the west, to the north side of Michmethah. According
to [Jos 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007), this place was before
Shechem, and therefore in any case it was not far from it, though it has
not been discovered yet. Knobel supposes it to have been on the site of
the present Kabate (Seetzen, ii. p. 166), Kubatiyeh, an hour and a half
to the south of Jenin (Rob. iii. 154), assuming that Michmethah might
also have been pronounced Chemathah, and that ב may have been
substituted for מ. But Kabate is six hours to the north of Shechem, and
therefore was certainly not "before Shechem" ([Jos
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007)). It then turned "eastward to
Taanath-shiloh" (Τηαν̀θ Σηλώ, lxx), according to the Onom. (s. v.
Thenath) ten Roman miles from Neapolis (Sichem), on the way to the
Jordan, most probably the Thena of Ptol. (v. 16, 5), the present Tana,
Ain Tana, a heap of ruins on the south-east of Nabulus, where there are
large cisterns to be found (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 295; Ritter, Erdk.
xv. p. 471). And "then went by on the east to Janoah" (i.e., Jano in
Acrabittena regione, twelve Roman miles from Neapolis: Onom.), the
present ruins of Jann, a miserable village, with extensive ruins of
great antiquity, about three hours to the south-east of Nabulus,
three-quarters of an hour to the north-east of Akrabeh (Rob. Bibl. Res.
p. 297; Van de Velde, R. ii. p. 268).

[Joshua 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 16:7</span></span>

From Janoah the boundary went down "to Ataroth and Naarath," Ataroth, a
different place from the Ataroth or Atroth-addar mentioned in [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003) and [Jos
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005), is apparently to be sought for
on the eastern slope of the mountains by the side of the Ghor, judging
from the expression "went down;" but it has not yet been discovered.
Naarath, probably the same as Naaran, in eastern Ephraim ([Ch1
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#028)), is described in the Onom. (s.
v. Naaratha) as viculus Judaeorum Naorath, five Roman miles (i.e., two
hours) from Jericho, probably on the north-east. The boundary line then
touched Jericho, i.e., the district of Jericho, namely on the north side
of the district, as Jericho was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin ([Jos
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#021)). At this point it also
coincided with the southern boundary of the tribe of Joseph ([Jos
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001)) and the northern boundary of
Benjamin ([Jos 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#012)).

[Joshua 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 16:8</span></span>

The western half of the northern boundary went from Tappuah westwards to
the Cane-brook, and terminated at the sea. Tappuah, called En-tappuah in
[Jos 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007), as the southern boundary of
Manasseh, which is there described, and which ran from Michmethah to
En-tappuah, coincides with the northern boundary of Ephraim, must not be
identified with the royal town of that name mentioned in [Jos
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#017), and therefore was not Kefr Kud
(Capercota), on the west of Jenin (Gina). This place was so far to the
north, viz., seven hours to the north of Nabulus, that the boundary from
Michmethah, in the neighbourhood of Shechem (Nabulus) onwards, would
have run from south to north instead of in a westerly direction. Still
less can En-tappuah be found, as Van de Velde supposes, in the old well
of the deserted village of Atf, five hours to the east of Nabulus. It
must have been to the west of Shechem; but it has not yet been
discovered, as the country to the west of Nabulus and Sebastieh has "not
been examined" (Van de Velde). The Cane-brook is no doubt the brook of
that name mentioned by Bohad. (vita Salad. pp. 191, 193); only it is not
quite clear "whether the Abu Zabura is intended, or a brook somewhat
farther south, where there is still a Nahr el Kassab."

[Joshua 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 16:9</span></span>

The tribe of Ephraim also received some scattered towns in the territory
of the tribe of Manasseh, in fact all those towns to which Tappuah
belonged, according to [Jos 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#008), with
the dependent villaGes.

(Note: The reason why the Ephraimites received scattered towns and
villages in the tribe-territory of Manasseh, is supposed by Calvin,
Masius, and others, to have been, that after the boundaries had been
arranged, on comparing the territory allotted to each with the relative
numbers of the two tribes, it was found that Ephraim had received too
small a possession. This is quite possible; at the same time there may
have been other reasons which we cannot discover now, as precisely the
same thing occurs in the case of Manasseh ([Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011)).)

[Joshua 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 16:10</span></span>

From Gezer, however (see [Jos 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003)),
they could not drive out the Canaanites, so that they still dwelt among
the Ephraimites, but were reduced to a state of serfdom. This notice
resembles the one in [Jos 15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063), and
is to be interpreted in the same way.
