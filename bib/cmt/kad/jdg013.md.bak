Samson's Life, and Conflicts with the Philistines - Judges 13-16

Whilst Jephthah, in the power of God, was delivering the tribes on the
east of the Jordan from the oppression of the Ammonites, the oppression
on the part of the Philistines continued uninterruptedly for forty years
in the land to the west of the Jordan ([Jdg
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001).md), and probably increased more and
more after the disastrous war during the closing years of the
high-priesthood of Eli, in which the Israelites suffered a sad defeat,
and even lost the ark of the covenant, which was taken by the
Philistines (1 Sam 4). But even during this period, Jehovah the God of
Israel did not leave himself without witness, either in the case of His
enemies the Philistines, or in that of His people Israel. The triumphant
delight of the Philistines at the capture of the ark was soon changed
into great and mortal terror, when Dagon their idol had fallen down from
its place before the ark of God and was lying upon the threshold of its
temple with broken head and arms; and the inhabitants of Ashdod, Gath,
and Ekron, to which the ark was taken, were so severely smitten with
boils by the hand of Jehovah, that the princes of the Philistines felt
constrained to send the ark, which brought nothing but harm to their
people, back into the land of the Israelites, and with it a
trespass-offering (1 Sam 5-6). At this time the Lord had also raised up
a hero for His people in the person of Samson, whose deeds were to prove
to the Israelites and Philistines that the God of Israel still possessed
the power to help His people and smite His foes.

The life and acts of Samson, who was to begin to deliver Israel out of
the hands of the Philistines, and who judged Israel for twenty years
under the rule of the Philistines ([Jdg
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005.md) and [Jdg
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#020).md), are described in Judg 13-16
with an elaborate fulness which seems quite out of proportion to the
help and deliverance which he brought to his people. His birth was
foretold to his parents by an appearance of the angel of the Lord, and
the boy was set apart as a Nazarite from his mother's womb. When he had
grown up, the Spirit of Jehovah began to drive him to seek occasions for
showing the Philistines his marvellous strength, and to inflict severe
blows upon them in a series of wonderful feats, until at length he was
seduced by the bewitching Delilah to make known to her the secret of his
supernatural strength, and was betrayed by her into the power of the
Philistines, who deprived him of the sight of his eyes, and compelled
him to perform the hardest and most degraded kinds of slave-labour. From
this he was only able to escape by bringing about his own death, which
he did in such a manner that his enemies were unable to triumph over
him, since he killed more of them at his death than he had killed during
the whole of his life before. And whilst the small results that followed
from the acts of this hero of God do not answer the expectations that
might naturally be formed from the miraculous announcement of his birth,
the nature of the acts which he performed appears still less to be such
as we should expect from a hero impelled by the Spirit of God. His
actions not only bear the stamp of adventure, foolhardiness, and
wilfulness, when looked at outwardly, but they are almost all associated
with love affairs; so that it looks as if Samson had dishonoured and
fooled away the gift entrusted to him, by making it subservient to his
sensual lusts, and thus had prepared the way for his own ruin, without
bringing any essential help to his people. "The man who carried the
gates of Gaza up to the top of the mountain was the slave of a woman, to
whom he frivolously betrayed the strength of his Nazarite locks. These
locks grew once more, and his strength returned, but only to bring death
at the same time to himself and his foes" (Ziegler). Are we to discern
in such a character as this a warrior of the Lord? Can Samson, the
promised son of a barren woman, a Nazarite from his birth, be the head
and flower of the Judges? We do not pretend to answer these questions in
the affirmative; and to justify this view we start from the fact, which
Ewald and Diestel both admit to be historical, that the deep earnest
background of Samson's nature is to be sought for in his Nazarite
condition, or rather that it is in this that the distinctive
significance of his character and of his life and deeds as judge all
culminates. The Nazarite was not indeed what Bertheau supposes him to
have been, "a man separated from human pursuits and turmoil;" but the
significance of the Nazarite condition was to be found in a consecration
of the life to God, which had its roots in living faith, and its outward
manifestations negatively, in abstinence from everything unclean, from
drinking wine, and even from fruit of the vine of every description, and
positively, in wearing the hair uncut. In the case of Samson this
consecration of the life to God was not an act of his own free will, or
a vow voluntarily taken; but it was imposed upon him by divine command
from his conception and birth. As a Nazarite, i.e., as a person vowed to
the Lord, he was to begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the
Philistines; and the bodily sign of his Nazarite condition, - namely,
the hair of his head that had never been touched by the scissors, - was
the vehicle of his supernatural strength with which he smote the
Philistines. In Samson the Nazarite, however, not only did the Lord
design to set before His people a man towering above the fallen
generation in heroic strength, through his firm faith in and confident
reliance upon the gift of God committed to him, opening up before it the
prospect of a renewal of its own strength, that by this type he might
arouse such strength and ability as were still slumbering in the nation;
but Samson was to exhibit to his age generally a picture on the one hand
of the strength which the people of God might acquire to overcome their
strongest foes through faithful submission to the Lord their God, and on
the other hand of the weakness into which they had sunk through
unfaithfulness to the covenant and intercourse with the heathen. And it
is in this typical character of Samson and his deeds that we find the
head and flower of the institution of judge in Israel.

The judges whom Jehovah raised up in the interval between Joshua and
Samuel were neither military commanders nor governors of the nation; nor
were they authorities instituted by God and invested with the government
of the state. They were not even chosen from the heads of the nation,
but were called by the Lord out of the midst of their brethren to be the
deliverers of the nation, either through His Spirit which came upon
them, or through prophets and extraordinary manifestations of God; and
the influence which they exerted, after the conquest and humiliation of
the foe and up to the time of their death, upon the government of the
nation and its affairs in general, was not the result of any official
rank, but simply the fruit and consequence of their personal ability,
and therefore extended for the most part only to those tribes to whom
they had brought deliverance from the oppression of their foes. The
tribes of Israel did not want any common secular ruler to fulfil the
task that devolved upon the nation at that time. God therefore raised up
even the judges only in times of distress and trouble. For their
appearance and work were simply intended to manifest the power which the
Lord could confer upon His people through His spirit, and were designed,
on the one hand, to encourage Israel to turn seriously to its God, and
by holding fast to His covenant to obtain the power to conquer all its
foes; and, on the other hand, to alarm their enemies, that they might
not attribute to their idols the power which they possessed to subjugate
the Israelites, but might learn to fear the omnipotence of the true God.
This divine power which was displayed by the judges culminated in
Samson. When the Spirit of God came upon him, he performed such mighty
deeds as made the haughty Philistines feel the omnipotence of Jehovah.
And this power he possessed by virtue of his condition as a Nazarite,
because he had been vowed or dedicated to the Lord from his mother's
womb, so long as he remained faithful to the vow that had been imposed
upon him.

But just as his strength depended upon the faithful observance of his
vow, so his weakness became apparent in his natural character,
particularly in his intrigues with the daughters of the Philistines; and
in this weakness there was reflected the natural character of the nation
generally, and of its constant disposition to fraternize with the
heathen. Love to a Philistine woman in Timnath not only supplied Samson
with the first occasion to exhibit his heroic strength to the
Philistines, but involved him in a series of conflicts in which he
inflicted severe blows upon the uncircumcised. This impulse to fight
against the Philistines came from Jehovah ([Jdg
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#004).md), and in these conflicts Jehovah
assisted him with the power of His Spirit, and even opened up a fountain
of water for him at Lehi in the midst of his severe fight, for the
purpose of reviving his exhausted strength ([Jdg
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#019).md). On the other hand, in his
intercourse with the harlot at Gaza, and his love affair with Delilah,
he trod ways of the flesh which led to his ruin. In his destruction,
which was brought about by his forfeiture of the pledge of the divine
gift entrusted to him, the insufficiency of the judgeship in itself to
procure for the people of God supremacy over their foes became fully
manifest; so that the weakness of the judgeship culminated in Samson as
well as its strength. The power of the Spirit of God, bestowed upon the
judges for the deliverance of their people, was overpowered by the might
of the flesh lusting against the spirit.

This special call received from God will explain the peculiarities
observable in the acts which he performed, - not only the smallness of
the outward results of his heroic acts, but the character of adventurous
boldness by which they were distinguished. Although he had been set
apart as a Nazarite from his mother's womb, he as not to complete the
deliverance of his people from the hands of the Philistines, but simply
to commence, it, i.e., to show to the people, by the manifestation of
supernatural heroic power, the possibility of deliverance, or to exhibit
the strength with which a man could slay a thousand foes. To answer this
purpose, it was necessary that the acts of Samson should differ from
those of the judges who fought at the head of military forces, and
should exhibit the stamp of confidence and boldness in the full
consciousness of possession divine and invincible power.

But whilst the spirit which prevailed in Israel during the time of the
judges culminated in the nature and deeds of Samson both in its weakness
and strength, the miraculous character of his deeds, regarded simply in
themselves, affords no ground for pronouncing the account a mere legend
which has transformed historical acts into miracles, except from a
naturalistic point of view, which rejects all miracles, and therefore
denies a priori the supernatural working of the living God in the midst
of His people. The formal character of the whole of the history of
Samson, which the opponents of the biblical revelation adduce for the
further support of this view, does not yield any tenable evidence of its
correctness. The external rounding off of the account proves nothing
more than that Samson's life and acts formed in themselves a compact and
well-rounded whole. But the assertion, that "well-rounded circumstances
form a suitable framework for the separate accounts, and that precisely
twelve acts are related of Samson, which are united into beautiful
pictures and narrated in artistic order" (Bertheau), is at variance with
the actual character of the biblical account. In order to get exactly
twelve heroic acts, Bertheau has to fix the stamp of a heroic act
performed by Samson himself upon the miraculous help which he received
from God through the opening up of a spring of water ([Jdg
15:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#018).md), and also to split up a
closely connected event, such as his breaking the bonds three times,
into three different actions.

(Note: On these grounds, L. Diestel, in the article Samson in Herzog's
Cycl., has rejected Bertheau's enumeration as unsatisfactory; and also
the division proposed by Ewald into five acts with three turns in each,
because, in order to arrive at this grouping, Ewald is not only obliged
to refer the general statement in [Jdg
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025.md), "the Spirit of God began to
drive Samson," to some heroic deed which is not described, but has also
to assume that in the case of one act (the carrying away of the gates at
Gaza) the last two steps of the legend are omitted from the present
account, although in all the rest Diestel follows Ewald's view almost
without exception. The views advanced by Ewald and Bertheau form the
foundation of Roskoff's Monograph, "the legend of Samson in its origin,
form, and signification, and the legend of Hercules,"in which the legend
of Samson is regarded as an Israelitish form of that of Hercules.)

If we simply confine ourselves to the biblical account, the acts of
Samson may be divided into two parts. The first (Judg 14 and 15)
contains those in which Samson smote the Philistines with gradually
increasing severity; the second (Judg 16) those by which he brought
about his own fall and ruin. These are separated from one another by the
account of the time that his judgeship lasted ([Jdg
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#020).md), and this account is briefly
repeated at the close of the whole account ([Jdg
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#031).md). The first part includes six
distinct acts which are grouped together in twos: viz., (1 and 2) the
killing of the lion on the way to Timnath, and the slaughter of the
thirty Philistines for the purpose of paying for the solution of his
riddle with the clothes that he took off them (Judg 14); (3 and 4) his
revenge upon the Philistines by burning their crops, because his wife
had been given to a Philistine, and also by the great slaughter with
which he punished them for having burned his father-in-law and wife
([Jdg 15:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#001)); (5 and 6.md) the bursting
of the cords with which his countrymen had bound him for the purpose of
delivering him up to the Philistines, and the slaying of 1000
Philistines with the jaw-bone of an ass ([Jdg
15:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#009).md). The second part of his life
comprises only three acts: viz., (1) taking off the town gates of Gaza,
and carrying them away ([Jdg 16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001).md);
(2) breaking the bonds with which Delilah bound him three separate times
([Jdg 16:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#004)); and (3.md) his heroic
death through pulling down the temple of Dagon, after he had been
delivered into the power of the Philistines through the treachery of
Delilah, and had been blinded by them (Judg 16:15-31). In this
arrangement there is no such artistic shaping or rounding off of the
historical materials apparent, as could indicate any mythological
decoration. And lastly, the popular language of Samson in proverbs,
rhymes, and a play upon words, does not warrant us in maintaining that
the popular legend invented this mode of expressing his thoughts, and
put the words into his mouth. All this leads to the conclusion, that
there is no good ground for calling in question the historical character
of the whole account of Samson's life and deeds.

(Note: No safe or even probable conjecture can be drawn from the
character of the history before us, with reference to the first written
record of the life of Samson, or the sources which the author of our
book of Judges made use of for this portion of his work. The recurrence
of such expressions as יחל followed by an infinitive ([Jdg
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005.md), [Jdg
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025.md); [Jdg
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#019.md), [Jdg
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#022).md), פּתּי ([Jdg
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#015.md); [Jdg
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#005).md), הציק ([Jdg
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#017.md); [Jdg
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#016), etc..md), upon which Bertheau lays
such stress, arises from the actual contents of the narrative itself.
The same expressions also occur in other places where the thought
requires them, and therefore they form no such peculiarities of style as
to warrant the conclusion that the life of Samson was the subject of a
separate work (Ewald), or that it was a fragment taken from a larger
history of the wars of the Philistines (Bertheau).)

[Judges 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 13:1</span></span>

Birth of Samson. - [Jdg 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001.md). The
oppression of the Israelites by the Philistines, which is briefly hinted
at in [Jdg 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007.md), is noticed again here
with the standing formula, "And the children of Israel did evil again in
the sight of the Lord," etc. (cf. [Jdg
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md); [Jdg
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001.md); [Jdg
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012).md), as an introduction to the
account of the life and acts of Samson, who began to deliver Israel from
the hands of these enemies. Not only the birth of Samson, but the
prediction of his birth, also fell, according to [Jdg
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005.md), within the period of the rule of
the Philistines over Israel. Now, as their oppression lasted forty
years, and Samson judged Israel for twenty years during that oppression
([Jdg 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#020.md); [Jdg
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#031).md), he must have commenced his
judgeship at an early age, probably before the completion of his
twentieth year; and with this the statement in Judg 14, that his
marriage with a Philistine woman furnished the occasion for his
conflicts with these enemies of his people, fully agrees. The end of the
forty years of the supremacy of the Philistines is not given in this
book, which closes with the death of Samson. It did not terminate till
the great victory which the Israelites gained over their enemies under
the command of Samuel (1 Sam 7). Twenty years before this victory the
Philistines had sent back the ark which they had taken from the
Israelites, after keeping it for seven months in their own land ([Sa1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002.md), and [Sa1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#001).md). It was within these twenty years
that most of the acts of Samson occurred. His first affair with the
Philistines, however, namely on the occasion of his marriage, took place
a year or two before this defeat of the Israelites, in which the sons of
Eli were slain, the ark fell into the hands of the Philistines, and the
high priest Eli fell from his seat and broke his neck on receiving the
terrible news ([Sa1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#018).md).
Consequently Eli died a short time after the first appearance of Samson.

[Judges 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 13:2</span></span>

Whilst the Israelites were given into the hands of the Philistines on
account of their sins, and were also severely oppressed in Gilead on the
part of the Ammonites, the angel of the Lord appeared to the wife of
Manoah, a Danite from Zorea, i.e., Sur'a, on the western slope of the
mountains of Judah (see at [Jos
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033).md). Mishpachath Dani (the family
of the Danites) is used interchangeably with shebet Dani (the tribe of
the Danites: see [Jdg 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#002.md), [Jdg
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#011.md), and [Jdg
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001.md), [Jdg
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030).md), which may be explained on this
ground, that according to [Num
26:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#042.md), all the Danites formed but
one family, viz., the family of the Shuhamites. The angel of the Lord
announced to this woman, who was barren, "Thou wilt conceive and bear a
son. And now beware, drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing
unclean: for, behold, thou wilt conceive and bear a son, and no razor
shall come upon his head; for a vowed man of God (Nazir) will the boy be
from his mother's womb," i.e., his whole life long, "to the day of his
death," as the angel expressly affirmed, according to [Jdg
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#007.md). The three prohibitions which the
angel of the Lord imposed upon the woman were the three things which
distinguished the condition of a Nazarite (see at [Num
6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#001.md), and the explanation given there
of the Nazarite vow). The only other thing mentioned in the Mosaic law
is the warning against defilement from contact with the dead, which does
not seem to have been enforced in the case of Samson. When the angel
added still further, "And he (the Nazarite) will begin to deliver Israel
out of the hand of the Philistines," he no doubt intended to show that
his power to effect this deliverance would be closely connected with his
condition as a Nazarite. The promised son was to be a Nazarite all his
life long, because he was to begin to deliver Israel out of the power of
his foes. And in order that he might be so, his mother was to share in
the renunciations of the Nazarite vow during the time of her pregnancy.
Whilst the appearance of the angel of the Lord contained the practical
pledge that the Lord still acknowledged His people, though He had given
them into the hands of their enemies; the message of the angel contained
this lesson and warning for Israel, that it could only obtain
deliverance from its foes by seeking after a life of consecration to the
Lord, such as the Nazarites pursued, so as to realize the idea of the
priestly character to which Israel had been called as the people of
Jehovah, by abstinence from the deliciae carnis, and everything that was
unclean, as being emanations of sin, and also by a complete
self-surrender to the Lord (see Pentateuch, p. 674).

[Judges 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 13:6</span></span>

The woman told her husband of this appearance: "A man of God," she said
(lit., the man of God, viz., the one just referred to), "came to me, and
his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very
terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his
name," etc. "Man of God" was the expression used to denote a prophet, or
a man who stood in immediate intercourse with God, such as Moses and
others (see at [Deu 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001).md). "Angel of
God" is equivalent to "angel of the Lord" ([Jdg
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001.md); [Jdg
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011).md), the angel in whom the invisible
God reveals himself to men. The woman therefore imagined the person who
appeared to her to have been a prophet, whose majestic appearance,
however, had produced the impression that he was a superior being;
consequently she had not ventured to ask him either his name or where he
came from.

[Judges 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 13:8</span></span>

Being firmly convinced of the truth of this announcement, and at the
same time reflecting upon the obligation which it imposed upon the
parents, Manoah prayed to the Lord that He would let the man of God whom
He had sent come to them again, to teach them what they were to do to
the boy that should be born, i.e., how they should treat him. היּוּלד,
according to the Keri היּלּד, is a participle Pual with the מ dropped
(see Ewald, 169, b.). This prayer was heard. The angel of God appeared
once more to the woman when she was sitting alone in the field without
her husband.

[Judges 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 13:10</span></span>

Then she hastened to fetch her husband, who first of all inquired of the
person who had appeared, "Art thou the man who said to the woman" (sc.,
what has been related in [Jdg 13:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#003).md)?
And when this was answered in the affirmative, he said still further
([Jdg 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#012).md), "Should thy word then
come to pass, what will be the manner of the boy, and his doing?" The
plural דּבריך is construed ad sensum with the singular verb, because the
words form one promise, so that the expression is not to be taken
distributively, as Rosenmller supposes. This also applies to [Jdg
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#017.md), Mishpat, the right belonging to
a boy, i.e., the proper treatment of him.

[Judges 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 13:13</span></span>

The angel of the Lord then repeated the instructions which he had
already given to the woman in [Jdg
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#004.md), simply adding to the prohibition
of wine and strong drink the caution not to eat of anything that came
from the vine, in accordance with [Num
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003.md).

[Judges 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 13:15</span></span>

As Manoah had not yet recognised in the man the angel of the Lord, as is
observed by way of explanation in [Jdg
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016.md), he wished, like Gideon ([Jdg
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#018).md), to give a hospitable
entertainment to the man who had brought him such joyful tidings, and
therefore said to him, "Let us detain thee, and prepare a kid for thee."
The construction לפניך נעשׂה is a pregnant one: "prepare and set before
thee." On the fact itself, see [Jdg
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#019.md).

[Judges 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 13:16</span></span>

The angel of the Lord replied, "If thou wilt detain me (sc., that I may
eat), I will not eat of thy food (אכל with בּ, to eat thereat, i.e.,
thereof, as in [Exo 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#043.md); [Lev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#011).md); but if thou wilt prepare a
burnt-offering for Jehovah, then offer it."

[Judges 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 13:17</span></span>

Manoah then asked his name: שׁמך מי, lit., "Who is thy name?" מי
inquires after the person; מה, the nature of quality (see Ewald, 325,
a.). "For if thy word come to pass, we will do thee honour." This was
the reason why he asked after his name. כּבּד, to honour by presents, so
as to show one's self grateful (see [Num
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#017.md), [Num
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#037.md); [Num
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#011).md).

The angel replied, "Why askest thou then after my name? truly it is
wonderful." The Kethibh פלאי is the adjectival form פּלאי from פּלא, for
which the Keri has פּלי, the pausal form of פּלי (from the radical פּלה
= פּלא). The word therefore is not the proper name of the angel of the
Lord, but expresses the character of his name; and as the name simply
denotes the nature, it expresses the peculiarity of his nature also. It
is to be understood in an absolute sense, - "absolutely and supremely
wonderful" (Seb. Schmidt), - as a predicate belonging to God alone
(compare the term "Wonderful" in [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md), and not to be toned down as it
is by Bertheau, who explains it as signifying "neither easy to utter nor
easy to comprehend."

Manoah then took the kid and the minchah, i.e., according to [Num
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#004.md)., the meat-offering belonging to
the burnt-offering, and offered it upon the rock, which is called an
altar in [Jdg 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#020.md), because the angel
of the Lord, who is of one nature with God, had sanctified it as an
altar through the miraculous acceptance of the sacrifice. לעשׁות מפלא,
"and wonderfully (miraculously) did he act" (הפליא followed by the
infinitive with ל as in [Ch2 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#015).md).
These words form a circumstantial clause, which is not to be attached,
however, to the subject of the principal clause, but to ליהוה: "Manoah
offered the sacrifice to the Lord, whereupon He acted to do wonderfully,
i.e., He performed a wonder or miracle, and Manoah and his wife saw it"
(see Ewald, Lehrb. 341, b., p. 724, note). In what the miracle consisted
is explained in [Jdg 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#020.md), in the
words, "when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar;" that
is to say, in the fact that a flame issued from the rock, as in the case
of Gideon's sacrifice ([Jdg 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#021).md), and
consumed the sacrifice. And the angel of the Lord ascended in this
flame. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell upon their faces to
the earth (sc., in worship), because they discovered from the miracle
that it was the angel of the Lord who had appeared to them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 13:21</span></span>

From that time forward the Lord did not appear to them again. But Manoah
was afraid that he and his wife should die, because they had seen God
(on this belief, see the remarks on [Gen
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013.md) and [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020).md). His wife quieted his fears,
however, and said, "Jehovah cannot intend to kill us, as He has accepted
our sacrifice, and has shown us all this" (the twofold miracle). "And at
this time He has not let us see such things as these." כּעת, at the time
in which we live, even if such things may possibly have taken place in
the hoary antiquity.

The promise of God was fulfilled. the boy whom the woman bare received
the name of Samson. שׁמשׁון (lxx, Σαμψών) does not mean sun-like, hero
of the sun, from שׁמשׁ (the sun), but, as Josephus explains it (Ant. v.
8, 4), ἰσχυρός, the strong or daring one, from שׁמשׁום, from the
intensive from שׁמשׁם, from שׁמם, in its original sense to be strong or
daring, not "to devastate." שׁדד is an analogous word: lit. to be
powerful, then to act powerfully, to devastate. The boy grew under the
blessing of God (see [Sa1 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021).md).

[Judges 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 13:25</span></span>

When he had grown up, the Spirit of Jehovah began to thrust him in the
camp of Dan. פּעם, to thrust, denoting the operation of the Spirit of
God within him, which took possession of him suddenly, and impelled him
to put forth supernatural powers. Mahaneh-dan, the camp of Dan, was the
name given to the district in which the Danites who emigrated, according
to [Jdg 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#012.md), from the inheritance of
their tribe, had pitched their encampment behind, i.e., to the west of,
Kirjath-jearim, or according to this verse, between Zorea and Eshtaol.
The situation cannot be determined precisely, as the situation of
Eshtaol itself has not been discovered yet (see at [Jos
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033).md). It was there that Samson lived
with his parents, judging from [Jdg
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#031.md). The meaning of this verse,
which forms the introduction to the following account of the acts of
Samson, is simply that Samson was there seized by the Spirit of Jehovah,
and impelled to commence the conflict with the Philistines.
