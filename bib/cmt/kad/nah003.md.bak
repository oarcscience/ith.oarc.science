Nineveh's Sins and Inevitable Destruction - Nahum 3

The announcement of the destruction awaiting Nineveh is confirmed by the
proof, that this imperial city has brought this fate upon itself by its
sins and crimes ([Nah 3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#001).md), and will
no more be able to avert it than the Egyptian No-amon was ([Nah
3:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008).md), but that, in spite of all its
resources, it will be brought to a terrible end ([Nah
3:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#014).md).

[Nahum 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 3:1</span></span>

The city of blood will have the shame, which it has inflicted upon the
nations, repaid to it by a terrible massacre. The prophet announces this
with the woe which opens the last section of this threatening prophecy.
[Nah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#001.md). "Woe to the city of blood!
She all full of deceit and murder; the prey departs not." ‛Ir dâmı̄m,
city of drops of blood, i.e., of blood shed, or of murders. This
predicate is explained in the following clauses: she all full of lying
and murder. Cachash and pereq are asyndeton, and accusatives dependent
upon מלאה. Cachash, lying and deceit: this is correctly explained by
Abarbanel and Strauss as referring to the fact that "she deceived the
nations with vain promises of help and protection." Pereq, tearing in
pieces for murder, - a figure taken from the lion, which tears its prey
in pieces ([Psa 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003).md). לא ימישׁ, the
prey does not depart, never fails. Mūsh: in the hiphil here, used
intransitively, "to depart," as in [Exo
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#022.md); [Psa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#012.md), and not in a transitive sense,
"to cause to depart," to let go; for if ‛ı̄r (the city) were the subject,
we should have tâmı̄sh.

[Nahum 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">nah 3:2</span></span>

This threat is explained in [Nah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#002.md).,
by a description of the manner in which a hostile army enters Nineveh
and fills the city with corpses. [Nah
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#002.md). "The cracking of whips, and noise
of the rattling of wheels, and the horse in galloping, and chariots
flying high. [Nah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#003.md). Riders dashing
along, and flame of the sword, and flashing of the lance, and multitude
of slain men and mass of dead men, and no end of corpses; they stumble
over their corpses. [Nah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#004.md). For the
multitude of the whoredoms of the harlot, the graceful one, the mistress
of witchcrafts, who sells nations with her whoredoms, and families with
her witchcrafts." Nahum sees in spirit the hostile army bursting upon
Nineveh. He hears the noise, i.e., the cracking of the whips of the
charioteers, and the rattling (ra‛ash) of the chariot-wheels, sees
horses and chariots driving along (dâhar, to hunt, cf. [Jdg
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#022.md); riqqēd, to jump, applied to the
springing up of the chariots as they drive quickly along over a rugged
road), dashing riders (ma‛ăleh, lit., to cause to ascend, sc. the horse,
i.e., to make it prance, by driving the spur into its side to accelerate
its speed), flaming swords, and flashing lances. As these words are well
adapted to depict the attack, so are those which follow to describe the
consequence or effect of the attack. Slain men, fallen men in abundance,
and so many corpses, that one cannot help stumbling or falling over
them. כּבד, the heavy multitude. The chethib יכשׁלו is to be read
יכּשׁלוּ (niphal), in the sense of stumbling, as in [Nah
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#006.md). The keri וכשׁלוּ is unsuitable,
as the sentence does not express any progress, but simply exhibits the
infinite number of the corpses (Hitzig). גויּתם, their (the slain men's)
corpses. This happens to the city of sins because of the multitude of
its whoredoms. Nineveh is called Zōnâh, and its conduct zenūnı̄m, not
because it had fallen away from the living God and pursued idolatry, for
there is nothing about idolatry either here or in what follows; nor
because of its commercial intercourse, in which case the commerce of
Nineveh would appear here under the perfectly new figure of love-making
with other nations (Ewald), for commercial intercourse as such is not
love-making; but the love-making, with its parallel "witchcrafts"
(keshâphı̄m), denotes "the treacherous friendship and crafty politics
with which the coquette in her search for conquests ensnared the smaller
states" (Hitzig, after Abarbanel, Calvin, J. H. Michaelis, and others).
This policy is called whoring or love-making, "inasmuch as it was that
selfishness which wraps itself up in the dress of love, and under the
appearance of love seeks simply the gratification of its own lust"
(Hengstenberg on the Rev.). The zōnâh is described still more minutely
as טובת חן, beautiful with grace. This refers to the splendour and
brilliancy of Nineveh, by which this city dazzled and ensnared the
nations, like a graceful coquette. Ba‛ălath keshâphı̄m, devoted to
witchcrafts, mistress of them. Keshâphı̄m (witchcrafts) connected with
zenūnı̄m, as in [Kg2 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022.md), are "the
secret wiles, which, like magical arts, do not come to the light in
themselves, but only in their effects" (Hitzig). מכר, to sell nations,
i.e., to rob them of liberty and bring them into slavery, to make them
tributary, as in [Deu 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030.md); [Jdg
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#014.md); [Jdg
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#008.md), etc. (not = כמר from כבר, to
entangle: Hitzig). בּזנוּניה, with (not for) their whoredoms.
Mishpâchōth, families, synonymous with עמּים, are smaller peoples or
tribes (cf. [Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md); [Eze
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#032).md).

[Nahum 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">nah 3:5</span></span>

The Lord will plunge Nineveh into shameful misery in consequence. [Nah
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005.md). "Behold, I come to thee, is the
saying of Jehovah of hosts; and uncover thy skirts over thy face, and
let nations see they nakedness, and kingdoms thy shame. [Nah
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#006.md). And cast horrible things upon
thee, and shame thee, and make thee a gazing-stock. [Nah
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#007.md). And it comes to pass, every one
who sees thee will flee before thee, and say, Is Nineveh laid waste? Who
will bewail her? whence do I seek comforters for thee?" [Nah
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005.md).a as in [Nah
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013.md). The punishment of Nineveh will
correspond to her conduct. Her coquetry shall be repaid to her by the
uncovering of her nakedness before the nations (cf. [Jer
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#026.md); [Isa
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003.md); [Hos
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005).md). Gillâh, to uncover. Shūlı̄m,
fimbriae, the skirts, borders, or lower end of the long sweeping dress
(cf. [Exo 28:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#033.md); [Isa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md). על פּניך, over thy countenance,
so that the train when lifted up is drawn over the face. מער, a
contraction of מערה, from ערה, signifies in [Kg1
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#036.md) an empty space, here nakedness or
shame equivalent to ערוה. This thought is carried out still further in
literal terms in [Nah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#006.md), [Nah
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#007.md). Shiqqutsı̄m, objects of
abhorrence, is used most frequently of idols; but here it is used in a
more general sense for unclean or repulsive things, dirt and filth.
Throwing dirt upon any one is a figurative expression for the most
ignominious treatment or greatest contempt. Nibbēl, to treat
contemptuously, not with words, as in [Mic
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#006.md), but with deeds, equivalent to
insult or abuse (cf. [Jer 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#021).md). To
make it כּראי, the object of sight, i.e., to give up to open shame,
παραδειγματίζειν ([Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019).md). ראי, a
pausal form of ראי, the seeing, here the spectacle, like θέατρον in [Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009.md). This is evident from [Nah
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#007.md), where ראיך contains a play upon
ראי. Every one who looks at her will flee from her as an object of
disgust. שׁדּדה, a rare form of the pual for שׁדּדה (for the fact,
compare [Jer 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#020).md). The last two
clauses express the thought that no one will take pity upon the
devastated city, because its fate is so well deserved; compare [Isa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019.md), where the same words are used
of Jerusalem. Nineveh will not be able to protect herself from
destruction even by her great power. The prophet wrests this vain hope
away from her by pointing in [Isa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008.md). to the fall of the mighty Thebes
in Egypt.

[Nahum 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">nah 3:8</span></span>

Nineveh will share the fate of No-Ammon. - [Nah
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md). "Art thou better than No-amon,
that sat by rivers, waters round about her, whose bulwark was the sea,
her wall of sea? [Nah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#009.md). Ethiopians
and Egyptians were (her) strong men, there is no end; Phut and Libyans
were for thy help. [Nah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010.md). She also
has gone to transportation, into captivity; her children were also
dashed in pieces at the corners of all roads; upon her nobles they cast
the lot, and all her great men were bound in chains." התיטבי for התיטבי,
for the sake of euphony, the imperfect kal of יטב, to be good, used to
denote prosperity in [Gen 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#013.md) and
[Gen 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#014.md), is applied here to the
prosperous condition of the city, which was rendered strong both by its
situation and its resources. נא אמון, i.e., probably "dwelling (נא
contracted from נוא, cf. נאות) of Amon," the sacred name of the
celebrated city of Thebes in Upper Egypt, called in Egyptian P-amen,
i.e., house of the god Amun, who had a celebrated temple there (Herod.
i. 182, ii. 42; see Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr. i. p. 177). The Greeks
called it Διὸς πόλις, generally with the predicate ἡ μεγάλη (Diod. Sic.
i. 45), or from the profane name of the city, which was Apet according
to Brugsch (possibly a throne, seat, or bank), and with the feminine
article prefixed, Tapet, or Tape, or Tepe, Θήβη, generally used in the
plural Θῆβαι. This strong royal city, which was described even by Homer
(Il. ix. 383) as ἑκατόμπυλος, and in which the Pharaohs of the 18th to
the 20th dynasties, from Amosis to the last Rameses, resided, and
created those works of architecture which were admired by Greeks and
Romans, and the remains of which still fill the visitor with
astonishment, was situated on both banks of the river Nile, which was
1500 feet in breadth at that point, and was built upon a broad plain
formed by the falling back of the Libyan and Arabian mountain wall, over
which there are now scattered nine larger or smaller fellah-villages,
including upon the eastern bank Karnak and Luxor, and upon the western
Gurnah and Medinet Abu, with their plantations of date-palms,
sugar-canes, corn, etc. היּשׁבה בּיארים, who sits there, i.e., dwells
quietly and securely, on the streams of the Nile. The plural יארים
refers to the Nile with its canals, which surrounded the city, as we may
see from what follows: "water round about her." אשׁר־חיל, not which is a
fortress of the sea (Hitzig), but whose bulwark is sea. חיל (for חילהּ)
does not mean the fortified place (Hitzig), but the fortification,
bulwark, applied primarily to the moats of a fortification, with the
wall belonging to it; then, in the broader sense, the defence of a city
in distinction from the actual wall (cf. [Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md); [Lam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008).md). מיּם, consisting of sea is its
wall, i.e., its wall is formed of sea. Great rivers are frequently
called yâm, sea, in rhetorical and poetical diction: for example, the
Euphrates in [Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md); [Jer
51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036.md); and the Nile in [Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002.md); [Isa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005.md); [Job
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#023.md). The Nile is still called by the
Beduins bahr, i.e., sea, and when it overflows it really resembles a
sea.

To the natural strength of Thebes there was also added the strength of
the warlike nations at her command. Cush, i.e., Ethiopians in the
stricter sense, and Mitsraim, Egyptians, the two tribes descended from
Ham, according to [Gen 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006.md), who
formed the Egyptian kingdom before the fall of Thebes, and under the
25th (Ethiopian) dynasty. עצמה, as in [Isa
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#029.md); [Isa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009.md), for עצם, strength; it is written
without any suffix, which may easily be supplied from the context. The
corresponding words to עצמה in the parallel clause are ואין קצה (with
Vav cop.): Egyptians, as for them there is no number; equivalent to an
innumerable multitude. To these there were to be added the auxiliary
tribes: Put, i.e., the Libyans in the broader sense, who had spread
themselves out over the northern part of Africa as far as Mauritania
(see at [Gen 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006).md); and Lubim =
Lehâbhı̄m, the Libyans in the narrower sense, probably the Libyaegyptii
of the ancients (see at [Gen 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013).md).
בּעזרתך (cf. [Psa 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002).md) Nahum
addresses No-amon itself, to give greater life to the description.
Notwithstanding all this might, No-amon had to wander into captivity.
Laggōlâh and basshebhı̄ are not tautological. Laggōlâh, for emigration,
is strengthened by basshebhı̄ into captivity. The perfect הלכה is
obviously not to be taken prophetically. The very antithesis of גּם־היא
הלכה and גּם־אתּ תּשׁכּרי ([Nah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#011).md)
shows to itself that הלכה refers to the past, as תּשׁכּרי does to the
future; yea, the facts themselves require that Nahum should be
understood as pointing to the fate which the powerful city of Thebes had
already experienced. For it must be an event that has already occurred,
and not something still in the future, which he holds up before Nineveh
as a mirror of the fate that is awaiting it. The clauses which follow
depict the cruelties that were generally associated with the taking of
an enemy's cities. For עלליה וגו roF .se, see [Hos
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001.md); [Isa
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016.md), and [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md); and for ידּוּ גורל, [Joe
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003.md) and [Oba
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011.md). Nikhbaddı̄m, nobiles; cf. [Isa
23:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md). Gedōlı̄m, magnates; cf. [Jon
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#007.md). It must be borne in mind,
however, that the words only refer to cruelties connected with the
conquest and carrying away of the inhabitants, and not to the
destruction of No-amon.

We have no express historical account of this occurrence; but there is
hardly any doubt that, after the conquest of Ashdod, Sargon the king of
Assyria organized an expedition against Egypt and Ethiopia, conquered
No-amon, the residence of the Pharaohs at that time, and, as Isaiah
prophesied ([Isa 20:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003).md), carried the
prisoners of Egypt and Ethiopia into exile. According to the Assyrian
researches and their most recent results (vid., Spiegel's Nineveh and
Assyria in Herzog's Cyclopaedia), the king Sargon mentioned in [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md) is not the same person as
Shalmaneser, as I assumed in my commentary on [Kg2
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003.md), but his successor, and the
predecessor of Sennacherib, who ascended the throne during the siege of
Samaria, and conquered that city in the first year of his reign, leading
27,280 persons into captivity, and appointing a vicegerent over the
country of the ten tribes. In Assyrian Sargon is called Sar Kin, i.e.,
essentially a king. He was the builder of the palace at Khorsabad, which
is so rich in monuments; and, according to the inscriptions, he carried
on wars in Susiana, Babylon, the borders of Egypt, Melitene, Southern
Armenia, Kurdistan, and Media; and in all his expeditions he resorted to
the removal of the people in great numbers, as one means of securing the
lasting subjugation of the lands (see Spiegel, l.c. p. 224). In the
great inscription in the palace-halls of Khorsabad, Sargon boasts
immediately after the conquest of Samaria of a victorious conflict with
Pharaoh Sebech at Raphia, in consequence of which the latter became
tributary, and also of the dethroning of the rebellious king of Ashdod;
and still further, that after another king of Ashdod, who had been
chosen by the people, had fled to Egypt, he besieged Ashdod with all his
army, and took it. Then follows a difficult and mutilated passage, in
which Rawlinson (Five Great Monarchies, ii. 416) and Oppert (Les
Sargonides, pp. 22, 26, 27) find an account of the complete subjugation
of Sebech (see Delitzsch on Isaiah, at [Isa
20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#005).md). There is apparently a
confirmation of this in the monuments recording the deeds of
Esarhaddon's successor, whose name is read Assur-bani-pal, according to
which that king carried on tedious wars in Egypt against Tirhaka, who
had conquered Memphis, Thebes, and sundry other Egyptian cities during
the illness of Esarhaddon, and according to his own account, succeeded
at length in completely overcoming him, and returned home with rich
booty, having first of all taken hostages for future good behaviour (see
Spiegel, p. 225). If these inscriptions have been read correctly, it
follows from them that from the reign of Sargon the Assyrians made
attempts to subjugate Egypt, and were partially successful, though they
could not maintain their conquests. The struggle between Assyria and
Egypt for supremacy in Hither Asia may also be inferred from the brief
notices in the Old Testament ([Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004).md) concerning the help which the
Israelitish king Hosea expected from So the king of Egypt, and also
concerning the advance of Tirhaka against Sennacherib.

(Note: From the modern researches concerning ancient Egypt, not the
smallest light can be obtained as to any of these things. "The
Egyptologists (as J. Bumller observes, p. 245) have hitherto failed to
fill up the gaps in the history of Egypt, and have been still less
successful in restoring the chronology; for hitherto we have not met
with a single well-established date, which we have obtained from a
monumental inscription; nor have the monuments enabled us to assign to a
single Pharaoh, from the 1st to the 21st, his proper place in the years
or centuries of the historical chronology.")

[Nahum 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">nah 3:11</span></span>

The same, or rather a worse fate than No-amon suffered, is now awaiting
Nineveh. [Nah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#011.md). "Thou also wilt be
drunken, shalt be hidden; thou also wilt seek for a refuge from the
enemy. [Nah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#012.md). All thy citadels are
fig-trees with early figs; if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth
of the eater. [Nah 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#013.md). Behold thy
people, women in the midst of thee; the gates of thy land are thrown
quite open to thine enemies; fire consumes thy bolts." גּם־אתּ
corresponds to גּם־היא in [Nah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010.md) :
as she, so also thou. "The fate of No-amon is a prophecy of thine own"
(Hitzig). תּשׁכּרי, thou wilt be drunken, viz., from the goblet of
divine wrath, as at [Oba 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#016.md). תּהי
נעלמה might mean, "thou wilt be hiding thyself;" but although this might
suit what follows, it does not agree with תּשׁכּרי , since an
intoxicated person is not in the habit of hiding himself. Moreover, נעלם
always means "hidden," occultus; so that Calvin's interpretation is the
correct one: "Thou wilt vanish away as if thou hadst never been; the
Hebrews frequently using the expression being hidden for being reduced
to nothing." This is favoured by a comparison both with [Nah
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md) and [Nah
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#012.md), and also with the parallel
passage in [Oba 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#016.md), "They will
drink, and be as if they had not been." This is carried out still
further in what follows: "Thou wilt seek refuge from the enemy," i.e.,
in this connection, seek it in vain, or without finding it; not, "Thou
wilt surely demand salvation from the enemy by surrender" (Strauss), for
מאויב does not belong to תּבקשׁי, but to מעוז (cf. [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004).md). All the fortifications of
Nineveh are like fig-trees with early figs (עם in the sense of
subordination, as in [Sol 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013).md), which
fall into the mouth of the eater when the trees are shaken. The tertium
compar. is the facility with which the castles will be taken and
destroyed by the enemy assaulting them (cf. [Isa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004).md). We must not extend the
comparison so far, however, as to take the figs as representing cowardly
warriors, as Hitzig does. Even in [Nah
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#013.md), where the people are compared to
women, the point of comparison is not the cowardliness of the warriors,
but the weakness and inability to offer any successful resistance into
which the nation of the Assyrians, which was at other times so warlike,
would be reduced through the force of the divine judgment inflicted upon
Nineveh (compare [Isa 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#016.md); [Jer
50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037.md); [Jer
51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030).md). לאיביך belongs to what
follows, and is placed first, and pointed with zakeph-katon for the sake
of emphasis. The gates of the land are the approaches to it, the passes
leading into it, which were no doubt provided with castles. Tuch (p. 35)
refers to the mountains on the north, which Pliny calls impassable. The
bolts of these gates are the castles, through which the approaches were
closed. Jeremiah transfers to Babel what is here said of Nineveh (see
[Jer 51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030).md).

[Nahum 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">nah 3:14</span></span>

In conclusion, the prophet takes away from the city so heavily laden
with guilt the last prop to its hope, - namely, reliance upon its
fortifications, and the numerical strength of its population. - [Nah
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#014.md). "Draw thyself water for the
siege! Make thy castles strong! tread in the mire, and stamp in the
clay! prepare the brick-kiln! [Nah
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#015.md). There will the fire devour thee,
the sword destroy thee, devour thee like the lickers. Be in great
multitude like the lickers, be in great multitude like the locusts? [Nah
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#016.md). Thou hast made thy merchants
more than the star so heaven; the licker enters to plunder, and flies
away. [Nah 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017.md). Thy levied ones are
like the locusts, and thy men like an army of grasshoppers which encamp
in the hedges in the day of frost; if the sun rises, they are off, and
men know not their place: where are they?" Water of the siege is the
drinking water necessary for a long-continued siege. Nineveh is to
provide itself with this, because the siege will last a long while. It
is also to improve the fortifications (chizzēq as in [Kg2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#008.md), [Kg2
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#013).md). This is then depicted still
more fully. Tı̄t and chōmer are used synonymously here, as in [Isa
41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025.md). Tı̄t, lit., dirt, slime, then
clay and potter's clay (Isaiah l.c.). Chōmer, clay or mortar ([Gen
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#003).md), also dirt of the streets ([Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md), compared with [Mic
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010).md). החזיק, to make firm, or strong,
applied to the restoration of buildings in [Neh
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#016.md) and [Eze
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009.md), [Eze
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#027.md); here to restore, or to put in
order, the brick-kiln (malbēn, a denom. from lebhēnâh, a brick), for the
purpose of burning bricks. The Assyrians built with bricks sometimes
burnt, sometimes unburnt, and merely dried in the sun. Both kinds are
met with on the Assyrian monuments (see Layard, vol. ii. p. 36ff.). This
appeal, however, is simply a rhetorical turn for the thought that a
severe and tedious siege is awaiting Nineveh. This siege will end in the
destruction of the great and populous city. שׁם, there, sc. in these
fortifications of thine, will fire consume thee; fire will destroy the
city with its buildings, and the sword destroy the inhabitants. The
destruction of Nineveh by fire is related by ancient writers (Herod.
1:106, 185; Diod. Sic. 2:25-28; Athen. xii. p. 529), and also confirmed
by the ruins (cf. Str. ad h. l.). It devours thee like the locust. The
subject is not fire or sword, either one or the other, but rather both
embraced in one. כּיּלק, like the licker; yeleq, a poetical epithet
applied to the locust (see at [Joe
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004).md), is the nominative, no the
accusative, as Calvin, Grotius, Ewald, and Hitzig suppose. For the
locusts are not devoured by the fire or the sword, but it is they who
devour the vegetables and green of the fields, so that they are
everywhere used as a symbol of devastation and destruction. It is true
that in the following sentences the locusts are used figuratively for
the Assyrians, or the inhabitants of Nineveh; but it is also by no means
a rare thing for prophets to give a new turn and application to a figure
or simile. The thought is this: fire and sword will devour Nineveh and
its inhabitants like the all-consuming locusts, even though the city
itself, with its mass of houses and people, should resemble an enormous
swarm of locusts. התכּבּד may be either an inf. abs. used instead of the
imperative, or the imperative itself. The latter seems the more simple;
and the use of the masculine may be explained on the assumption that the
prophet had the people floating before his mind, whereas in התכּבּדי he
was thinking of the city. Hithkahbbēd, to show itself heavy by virtue of
the large multitude; similar to כּבד in [Nah
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#010.md) (cf. כּבד in [Gen
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#002.md); [Exo
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#020), etc..md).

The comparison to a swarm of locusts is carried still further in [Nah
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#016.md) and [Nah
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017.md), and that so that [Nah
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#016.md) explains the תּאכלך כּיּלק in
[Nah 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#015.md). Nineveh has multiplied its
traders or merchants, even more than the stars of heaven, i.e., to an
innumerable multitude. The yeleq, i.e., the army of the enemy, bursts in
and plunders. That Nineveh was a very rich commercial city may be
inferred from its position, - namely, just at the point where, according
to oriental notions, the east and west meet together, and where the
Tigris becomes navigable, so that it was very easy to sail from thence
into the Persian Gulf; just as afterwards Mosul, which was situated
opposite, became great and powerful through its widely-extended trade
(see Tuch, l.c. p. 31ff., and Strauss, in loc.).

(Note: "The point," says O. Strauss (Nineveh and the Word of God, Berl
1855, p. 19), "at which Nineveh was situated was certainly the
culminating point of the three quarters of the globe - Europe, Asia, and
Africa; and from the very earliest times it was just at the crossing of
the Tigris by Nineveh that the great military and commercial roads met,
which led into the heart of all the leading known lands.")

The meaning of this verse has been differently interpreted, according to
the explanation given to the verb pâshat. Many, following the ὥρμησε and
expansus est of the lxx and Jerome, give it the meaning, to spread out
the wing; whilst Credner (on Joel, p. 295), Maurer, Ewald, and Hitzig
take it in the sense of undressing one's self, and understand it as
relating to the shedding of the horny wing-sheaths of the young locusts.
But neither the one nor the other of these explanations can be
grammatically sustained. Pâshat never means anything else then to
plunder, or to invade with plundering; not even in such passages as [Hos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md); [Ch1
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#009.md) and [Ch1
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#013.md), which Gesenius and Dietrich
quote in support of the meaning, to spread; and the meaning forced upon
it by Credner, of the shedding of the wing-sheaths by locusts, is
perfectly visionary, and has merely been invented by him for the purpose
of establishing his false interpretation of the different names given to
the locusts in [Joe 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md). In the
passage before us we cannot understand by the yeleq, which "plunders and
flies away" (pâshat vayyâ‛ōph), the innumerable multitude of the
merchants of Nineveh, because they were not able to fly away in crowds
out of the besieged city. Moreover, the flying away of the merchants
would be quite contrary to the meaning of the whole description, which
does not promise deliverance from danger by flight, but threatens
destruction. The yeleq is rather the innumerable army of the enemy,
which plunders everything, and hurries away with its booty. In [Nah
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017.md) the last two clauses of [Nah
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#015.md) are explained, and the warriors
of Nineveh compared to an army of locusts. There is some difficulty
caused by the two words מנּזריך and טפסריך, the first of which only
occurs here, and the second only once more, viz., in [Jer
51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md), where we meet with it in the
singular. That they both denote warlike companies appears to be
tolerably certain; but the real meaning cannot be exactly determined.
מנּזרים with dagesh dir., as for example in מקּדשׁ in [Exo
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017.md), is probably derived from nâzar,
to separate, and not directly from nezer, a diadem, or nâzı̄r, the
crowned person, from which the lexicons, following Kimchi's example,
have derived the meaning princes, or persons ornamented with crowns;
whereas the true meaning is those levied, selected (for war), analogous
to bâchūr, the picked or selected one, applied to the soldiery. The
meaning princes or captains is at variance with the comparison to
'arbeh, the multitude of locusts, since the number of the commanders in
an army, or of the war-staff, is always a comparatively small one. And
the same objection may be offered to the rendering war-chiefs or
captains, which has been given to taphsar, and which derives only an
extremely weak support from the Neo-Persian tâwsr, although the word
might be applied to a commander-in-chief in [Jer
51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md), and does signify an angel in
the Targum-Jonathan on [Deu 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#012.md). The
different derivations are all untenable (see Ges. Thes. p. 554); and the
attempt of Bttcher (N. Krit. Aehrenl. ii. pp. 209-10) to trace it to the
Aramaean verb טפס, obedivit, with the inflection ־ר for ־ן, in the sense
of clientes, vassals, is precluded by the fact that ar does not occur as
a syllable of inflection. The word is probably Assyrian, and a technical
term for soldiers of a special kind, though hitherto it has not been
explained. גּוב גּובי, locusts upon locusts, i.e., an innumerable swarm
of locusts. On גּובי, see at [Amo 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001.md);
and on the repetition of the same word to express the idea of the
superlative, see the comm. on [Kg2
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#023) (and Ges. 108, 4.md). Yōm qârâh,
day (or time) of cold, is either the night, which is generally very cold
in the East, or the winter-time. To the latter explanation it may be
objected, that locusts do not take refuge in walls or hedges during the
winter; whilst the expression yōm, day, for night, may be pleaded
against the former. We must therefore take the word as relating to
certain cold days, on which the sky is covered with clouds, so that the
sun cannot break through, and zârach as denoting not the rising of the
sun, but its shining or breaking through. The wings of locusts become
stiffened in the cold; but as soon as the warm rays of the sun break
through the clouds, they recover their animation and fly away. Nōdad,
(poal), has flown away, viz., the Assyrian army, which is compared to a
swarm of locusts, so that its place is known no more (cf. [Psa
103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016).md), i.e., has perished without
leaving a trace behind. איּם contracted from איּה הם. These words depict
in the most striking manner the complete annihilation of the army on
which Nineveh relied.

[Nahum 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">nah 3:18</span></span>

Such an end will come to the Assyrian kingdom on the overthrow of
Nineveh. [Nah 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#018.md). "The shepherds
have fallen asleep, king Asshur: thy glorious ones are lying there: thy
people have scattered themselves upon the mountains, and no one gathers
them. [Nah 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#019.md). No alleviation to thy
fracture, thy stroke is grievous: all who hear tidings of thee clap the
hand over thee: for over whom hath not thy wickedness passed
continually?" The king of Asshur addressed in [Nah
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#018.md) is not the last historical king
of that kingdom, but a rhetorical personification of the holder of the
imperial power of Assyria. His shepherds and glorious ones ('addı̄rı̄m, as
in [Nah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#006).md) are the princes and great
men, upon whom the government and defence of the kingdom devolved, the
royal counsellors, deputies, and generals. Mâmū, from nūm, to slumber,
to sleep, is not a figurative expression for carelessness and inactivity
here; for the thought that the people would be scattered, and the
kingdom perish, through the carelessness of the rulers (Hitzig), neither
suits the context, where the destruction of the army and the laying of
the capital in ashes are predicted, nor the object of the whole
prophecy, which does not threaten the fall of the kingdom through the
carelessness of its rulers, but the destruction of the kingdom by a
hostile army. Nūm denotes here, as in [Psa
76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006.md), the sleep of death (cf. [Psa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004.md); [Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md), [Jer
51:57](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#057.md) : Theodoret, Hesselb., Str., and
others). Shâkhan, a synonym of shâkhabh, to have lain down, to lie
quietly ([Jdg 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#017).md), used here of the
rest of death. As the shepherds have fallen asleep, the flock (i.e., the
Assyrian people) is scattered upon the mountains and perishes, because
no one gathers it together. Being scattered upon the mountains, is
easily explained from the figure of the flock (cf. [Num
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#017.md); [Kg1
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#017.md); [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007).md), and implies destruction. The
mountains are mentioned with evident reference to the fact that Nineveh
is shut in towards the north by impassable mountains. Kēhâh, a noun
formed from the adjective, the extinction of the wound (cf. [Lev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#006).md), i.e., the softening or
anointing of it. Shebher, the fracture of a limb, is frequently applied
to the collapse or destruction of a state or kingdom (e.g., [Psa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004.md); [Lam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011).md). נחלה מכּתך, i.e., dangerously
bad, incurable is the stroke which has fallen upon thee (cf. [Jer
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019.md); [Jer
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017.md); [Jer
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#012).md). Over thy destruction will all
rejoice who hear thereof. שׁמעך, the tidings of thee, i.e., of that
which has befallen thee. Clapping the hands is a gesture expressive of
joy (cf. [Psa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md); [Isa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012).md). All: because they all had to
suffer from the malice of Asshur. רעה, malice, is the tyranny and
cruelty which Assyria displayed towards the subjugated lands and
nations.

Thus was Nineveh to perish. If we inquire now how the prophecy was
fulfilled, the view already expressed by Josephus (Ant. x. 2), that the
fall of the Assyrian empire commenced with the overthrow of Sennacherib
in Judah, is not confirmed by the results of the more recent
examinations of the Assyrian monuments. For according to the
inscriptions, so far as they have been correctly deciphered, Sennacherib
carried out several more campaigns in Susiana and Babylonia after that
disaster, whilst ancient writers also speak of an expedition of his to
Cilicia. His successor, Esarhaddon, also carried on wars against the
cities of Phoenicia, against Armenia and Cilicia, attacked the Edomites,
and transported some of them to Assyria, and is said to have brought a
small and otherwise unknown people, the Bikni, into subjection; whilst
we also know from the Old Testament ([Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011).md) that his generals led king
Manasseh in chains to Babylon. Like many of his predecessors, he built
himself a palace at Kalah or Nimrud; but before the internal decorations
were completely finished, it was destroyed by so fierce a fire, that the
few monuments preserved have suffered very considerably. His successor
is the last king of whom we have any inscriptions, with his name still
legible upon them (viz., Assur-bani-pal). He carried on wars not only in
Susiana, but also in Egypt, viz., against Tirhaka, who had conquered
Memphis, Thebes, and other Egyptian cities, during the illness of
Esarhaddon; also on the coast of Syria, and in Cilicia and Arabia; and
completed different buildings which bear his name, including a palace in
Kouyunjik, in which a room has been found with a library in it,
consisting of clay tablets. Assur-bani-pal had a son, whose name was
written Asur-emid-ilin, and who is regarded as the Sarakos of the
ancients, under whom the Assyrian empire perished, with the conquest and
destruction of Nineveh (see Spiegel in Herzog's Cycl.). But if,
according to these testimonies, the might of the Assyrian empire was not
so weakened by Sennacherib's overthrow in Judah, that any hope could be
drawn from that, according to human conjecture, of the speedy
destruction of that empire; the prophecy of Nahum concerning Nineveh,
which was uttered in consequence of that catastrophe, cannot be taken as
the production of any human combination: still less can it be taken, as
Ewald supposes, as referring to "the first important siege of Nineveh,
under the Median king Phraortes (Herod. i. 102)." For Herodotus says
nothing about any siege of Nineveh, but simply speaks of a war between
Phraortes and the Assyrians, in which the former lost his life. Nineveh
was not really besieged till the time of Cyaxares (Uwakhshatra), who
carried on the war with an increased army, to avenge the death of his
father, and forced his way to Nineveh, to destroy that city, but was
compelled, by the invasion of his own land by the Scythians, to
relinquish the siege, and hasten to meet that foe (Her. i. 103). On the
extension of his sway, the same Cyaxares commenced a war with the Lydian
king Alyattes, which was carried on for five years with alternating
success and failure on both sides, and was terminated in the sixth year
by the fact, that when the two armies were standing opposite to one
another, drawn up in battle array, the day suddenly darkened into night,
which alarmed the armies, and rendered the kings disposed for peace.
This was brought about by the mediation of the Cilician viceroy
Syennesis and the Babylonian viceroy Labynetus, and sealed by the
establishment of a marriage relationship between the royal families of
Lydia and Media (Her. i. 74). And if this Labynetus was the same person
as the Babylonian king Nabopolassar, which there is no reason to doubt,
it was not till after the conclusion of this peace that Cyaxares formed
an alliance with Nabopolassar to make war upon Nineveh; and this
alliance was strengthened by his giving his daughter Amuhea in marriage
to Nabopolassar's son Nebuchadnezzar (Nabukudrossor). The combined
forces of these two kings now advanced to the attack upon Nineveh, and
conquered it, after a siege of three years, the Assyrian king Saracus
burning himself in his palace as the besiegers were entering the city.
This is the historical kernel of the capture and destruction of Nineveh,
which may be taken as undoubted fact from the accounts of Herodotus (i.
106) and Diod. Sic. (ii. 24-28), as compared with the extract from
Abydenus in Euseb. Chron. Armen. i. p. 54; whereas it is impossible to
separate the historical portions from the legendary and in part mythical
decorations contained in the elaborate account given by Diodorus (vid.,
M. v. Niebuhr, Geschichte Assurs, p. 200ff.; Duncker, Geschichte des
Alterthums. i. p. 793ff.; and Bumller, Gesch. d. Alterth. i. p. 316ff.).

The year of the conquest and destruction of Nineveh has been greatly
disputed, and cannot be exactly determined. As it is certain that
Nabopolassar took part in the war against Nineveh, and this is
indirectly intimated even by Herodotus, who attributes the conquest of
it to Cyaxares and the Medes (vid., i. 106), Nineveh must have fallen
between the years 625 and 606 b.c. For according to the canon of
Ptolemy, Nabopolassar was king of Babylon from 625 to 606; and this date
is astronomically established by an eclipse of the moon, which took
place in the fifth year of his reign, and which actually occurred in the
year 621 b.c. (vid., Niebuhr, p. 47). Attempts have been made to
determine the year of the taking of Nineveh, partly with reference to
the termination of the Lydio-Median war, and partly from the account
given by Herodotus of the twenty-eight years' duration of the Scythian
rule in Asia. Starting from the fact, that the eclipse of the sun, which
put an end to the war between Cyaxares and Alyattes, took place,
according to the calculation of Altmann, on the 30th September b.c. 610
(see Ideler, Handbuch der Chronologie, i. p. 209ff.), M. v. Niebuhr (pp.
197-8) has assumed that, at the same time as the mediation of peace
between the Lydians and Medes, an alliance was formed between Cyaxares
and Nabopolassar for the destruction of Nineveh; and as this treaty
could not possibly be kept secret, the war against Assyria was commenced
at once, according to agreement, with their united forces. But as it was
impossible to carry out extensive operations in winter, the siege of
Nineveh may not have commenced till the spring of 609; and as it lasted
three years according to Ctesias, the capture may not have been effected
before the spring of 606 b.c. It is true that this combination is
apparently confirmed by the fact, that during that time the Egyptian
king Necho forced his way into Palestine and Syria, and after subduing
all Syria, advanced to the Euphrates; since this advance of the Egyptian
is most easily explained on the supposition that Nabopolassar was so
occupied with the war against Nineveh, that he could not offer any
resistance to the enterprise of Necho. And the statement in [Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md), that Necho had come up to fight
against the king of Asshur on the Euphrates, appears to favour the
conclusion, that at that time (i.e., in the year of Josiah's death, 610
b.c.) the Assyrian empire was not yet destroyed. Nevertheless there are
serious objections to this combination. In the first place, there is the
double difficulty, that Cyaxares would hardly have been in condition to
undertake the war against Nineveh in alliance with Nabopolassar,
directly after the conclusion of peace with Alyattes, especially after
he had carried on a war for five years, without being able to defeat his
enemy; and secondly, that even Nabopolassar, after a fierce three years'
conflict with Nineveh, the conquest of which was only effected in
consequence of the wall of the city having been thrown down for the
length of twenty stadia, would hardly possess the power to take the
field at once against Pharoah Necho, who had advanced as far as the
Euphrates, and not only defeat him at Carchemish, but pursue him to the
frontier of Egypt, and wrest from him all the conquests that he had
effected, as would necessarily be the case, since the battle at
Carchemish was fought in the year 606; and the pursuit of the defeated
foe by Nebuchadnezzar, to whom his father had transferred the command of
the army because of his own age an infirmity, even to the very border of
Egypt, is so distinctly attested by the biblical accounts ([Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md) and [Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007.md); [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002).md), and by the testimony of Berosus
in Josephus (Ant. x. 11, 1, and c. Ap. i. 19), that these occurrences
are placed beyond the reach of doubt (see comm. on [Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md). These difficulties would not
indeed be sufficient in themselves to overthrow the combination
mentioned, provided that the year 610 could be fixed upon with certainty
as the time when the Lydio-Median war was brought to a close. But that
is not the case; and this circumstance is decisive. The eclipse of the
sun, which alarmed Cyaxares and Alyattes, and made them disposed for
peace, must have been total, or nearly total, in Central Asia and
Cappadocia, to produce the effect described. But it has been proved by
exact astronomical calculations, that on the 30th September 610 b.c.,
the shadow of the moon did not fall upon those portions of Asia Minor,
whereas it did so on the 18th May 622, after eight o'clock in the
morning, and on the 28th May 585 (vid., Bumll. p. 315, and M. v.
Niebuhr, pp. 48, 49). Of these two dates the latter cannot come into
consideration at all, because Cyaxares only reigned till the year 594;
and therefore, provided that peace had not been concluded with Alyattes
before 595, he would not have been able to carry on the war with Nineveh
and conquer that city. On the other hand, there is no valid objection
that can be offered to our transferring the conclusion of peace with the
Lydian king to the year 622 b.c. Since, for example, Cyaxares became
king as early as the year 634, he might commence the war with the
Lydians as early as the year 627 or 628; and inasmuch as Nabopolassar
was king of Babylon from 625 to 605, he might very well help to bring
about the peace between Cyaxares and Alyattes in the year 622. In this
way we obtain the whole space between 622 and 605 b.c. for the war with
Nineveh; so that the city may have been taken and destroyed as early as
the years 615-610.

Even the twenty-eight years' duration of the Scythian supremacy in Asia,
which is recorded by Herodotus (i. 104, 106, cf. iv. 1), cannot be
adduced as a well-founded objection. For if the Scythians invaded Media
in the year 633, so as to compel Cyaxares to relinquish the siege of
Nineveh, and if their rule in Upper Asia lasted for twenty-eight years,
the expedition against Nineveh, which led to the fall of that city,
cannot have taken place after the expulsion of the Scythians in the year
605, because the Assyrian empire had passed into the hands of the
Chaldaeans before that time, and Nebuchadnezzar had already defeated
Necho on the Euphrates, and was standing at the frontier of Egypt, when
he received the intelligence of his father's death, which led him to
return with all speed to Babylon. There is no other alternative left,
therefore, than either to assume, as M. v. Niebuhr does (pp. 119, 120),
that the war of Cyaxares with the Lydians, and also the last war against
Nineveh, and probably also the capture of Nineveh, and the greatest
portion of the Median conquests between Ararat and Halys, fell within
the period of the Scythian sway, so that Cyaxares extended his power as
a vassal of the Scythian Great Khan as soon as he had recovered from the
first blow received from these wild hordes, inasmuch as that sovereign
allowed his dependent to do just as he liked, provided that he paid the
tribute, and did not disturb the hordes in their pasture grounds; or
else to suppose that Cyaxares drove out the Scythian hordes from Media
at a much earlier period, and liberated his own country from their sway;
in which case the twenty-eight years of Herodotus would not indicate the
period of their sway over Media and Upper Asia, but simply the length of
time that they remained in Hither Asia generally, or the period that
intervened between their first invasion and the complete disappearance
of their hordes. If Cyaxares had driven the Scythians out of his own
land at a much earlier period, he might extend his dominion even while
they still kept their position in Hither Asia, and might commence the
war with the Lydians as early as the year 628 or 627, especially as his
wrath is said to have been kindled because Alyattes refused to deliver
up to him a Scythian horde, which had first of all submitted to
Cyaxares, and then fled into Lydia to Alyattes (Herod. i. 73). Now,
whichever of these two combinations be the correct one, they both show
that the period of the war commenced by Cyaxares against Nineveh, in
alliance with Nabopolassar, cannot be determined by the statement made
by Herodotus with regard to the twenty-eight years of the Scythian rule
in Asia; and this Scythian rule, generally, does not compel us to place
the taking and destruction of Nineveh, and the dissolution of the
Assyrian empire, as late as the year 605 b.c., or even later.

At this conquest Nineveh was so utterly destroyed, that, as Strabo (xvi.
1, 3) attests, the city entirely disappeared immediately after the
dissolution of the Assyrian kingdom (ἡ μὲν οὖν Νῖνος πόλις ἠφανίσθη
παραχρῆμα μετὰ τὴν τῶν Σύρων κατάλυσιν). When Xenophon entered the plain
of Nineveh, in the year 401, on the retreat of the ten thousand Greeks,
he found the ruins of two large cities, which he calls Larissa and
Mespila, and by the side of the first a stone pyramid of 200 feet in
height and 100 feet in breadth, upon which many of the inhabitants of
the nearest villages had taken refuge, and heard from the inhabitants
that it was only by a miracle that it had been possible for the Persians
to conquer those cities with their strong walls (Xenoph. Anab. iii. 4,
7ff.). These ruined cities had been portions of the ancient Nineveh:
Larissa was Calah; and Mespila, Kouyunjik. Thus Xenophon passed by the
walls of Nineveh without even learning its name. Four hundred years
after (according to Tacitus, Annal. xii. 13), a small fortress stood on
this very spot, to guard the crossing of the Tigris; and the same
fortress is mentioned by Abul-Pharaj in the thirteenth century (Hist.
Dynast. pp. 266, 289, 353). Opposite to this, on the western side of the
Tigris, Mosul had risen into one of the first cities of Asia, and the
ruins of Nineveh served as quarries for the building of the new city, so
that nothing remained but heaps of rubbish, which even Niebuhr took to
be natural heights in the year 1766, when he was told, as he stood by
the Tigris bridge, that he was in the neighbourhood of ancient Nineveh.
So completely had this mighty city vanished from the face of the earth;
until, in the most recent times, viz., from 1842 onwards, Botta the
French consul, and the two Englishmen Layard and Rawlinson, instituted
excavations in the heaps, and brought to light numerous remains of the
palaces and state-buildings of the Assyrian rulers of the world. Compare
the general survey of these researches, and their results, in Herm. J.
C. Weissenborn's Ninive u. sein Gebiet., Erfurt 1851, and 56, 4.

But if Nahum's prophecy was thus fulfilled in the destruction of
Nineveh, even to the disappearance of every trace of its existence, we
must not restrict it to this one historical event, but must bear in mind
that, as the prophet simply saw in Nineveh the representative for the
time of the power of the world in its hostility to God, so the
destruction predicted to Nineveh applied to all the kingdoms of the
world which have risen up against God since the destruction of Asshur,
and which will still continue to do so to the end of the world.
