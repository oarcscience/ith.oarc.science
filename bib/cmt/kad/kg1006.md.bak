Building of the Temple - 1 Kings 6

The account of the building of the temple commences with a statement of
the date of the building ([Kg1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001).md);
and this is followed by a description of the plan and size of the
temple-house ([Kg1 6:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002).md), to which
there is also appended the divine promise made to Solomon during the
erection of the building ([Kg1
6:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#011).md). After this we have a further
account of the internal fittings and decorations of the sanctuary (vv.
14-36), and in [Kg1 7:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md) a
description of the royal palace which was built after the temple; and,
finally, a description of the pillars of the court which were executed
in metal by the Tyrian artist, and of the different vessels of the
temple (1 Kings 7:13-51).

(Note: Of the special works on the subject of the temple, see my
pamphlet, Der Tempel Salomo's, eine archologische Untersuchung (Dorp.
1839); and Carl Chr. W. F. Bhr, Der Salomonische Tempel mit
Bercksichtigung seines Verhltnisses zur heil. Architectur berhaupt
(Karlsr. 1848). In both of these there are critical notices of the
earlier investigations and monographs on this subject, which have now
simply a historical interest. See also the short description of the
temple in my Bibl. Archologie, i. 23ff., with sketches of the temple
building and the principal vessels on Plates 2 and 3, and the most
recent notice by H. Merz in Herzog's Cyclopaedia (Art. Temple).

We have a parallel to this in 2 Chron 3 and 4, though here the
description is differently arranged. In the Chronicles the external
building of the temple-house is not separated from the internal
decoration and furnishing; but after the period of erection and the size
of the temple-house have been given in [Ch2
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001.md), there follows a description, a.
of the court ([Ch2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004).md); b. of the
Holy Place with its internal decorations ([Ch2
3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#005).md); c. of the most Holy Place,
with special reference to its size and decorations, also of the colossal
cherubim placed therein and the curtain in front of it, which is not
mentioned in our account ([Ch2
3:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#008).md); d. of the brazen pillars in
front of the court ([Ch2 3:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#015).md); e.
of the altar of burnt-offering ([Ch2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001).md), which is passed over in the
account before us; f. of the brazen sea ([Ch2
4:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#002).md); g. of the brazen lavers, the
golden candlesticks, the tables of shewbread, and the golden basons
([Ch2 4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006).md); and h. of the courts
([Ch2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009).md). The account is then closed
with a summary enumeration of the different vessels of the temple ([Ch2
4:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#010).md), which agrees almost word for
word with [Kg1 7:40-50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040.md).

The Outside of the Building. - [Kg1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md). The building of the temple, a
fixed and splendid house of Jehovah as the dwelling-place of His name in
the midst of His people, formed an important epoch so far as the Old
Testament kingdom of God was concerned, inasmuch as, according to the
declaration of God made through the prophet Nathan, an end would thereby
be put to the provisional condition of the people of Israel in the land
of Canaan, since the temple was to become a substantial pledge of the
permanent possession of the inheritance promised by the Lord. The
importance of this epoch is indicated by the fact, that the time when
the temple was built is defined not merely in relation to the year of
Solomon's reign, but also in relation to the exodus of the Israelites
out of Egypt. "In the 480th year after the exodus of the sons of Israel
out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, in the
second month of the year, Solomon built the house of the Lord." The
correctness of the number 480, as contrasted with the 440th year of the
lxx and the different statements made by Josephus, is now pretty
generally admitted; and we have already proved at [Jdg
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007.md) that it agrees with the duration
of the period of the Judges when rightly estimated.

(Note: In opposition to the hypothesis of Bttcher, which has been
repeated by Bertheau, viz., that the number 480 merely rests upon the
computation of 12 x 40 years, or twelve generations of forty years each,
Thenius himself has observed with perfect justice, that "where both the
year and the month of the reign of the king in question are given, the
principal number will certainly rest upon something more than mere
computation; and if this had not been the case, the person making such a
computation, if only for the purpose of obtaining the appearance of an
exact statement, would have made a particular calculation of the years
of Solomon's reign, and would have added them to the round number
obtained, and written 'in the year 484.' Moreover, the introduction to
our chapter has something annalistic in its tone; and at this early
period it would be undoubtedly well known, and in a case like the
present a careful calculation would be made, how long a time had elapsed
since the most memorable period of the Israelitish nation had passed
by." Compare with this Ed. Preuss (Die Zeitrechnung der lxx, p. 74ff.),
who has endeavoured with much greater probability to show that the
alteration made by the lxx into 440 rests upon nothing more than a
genealogical combination.)

The name of the month Ziv, brilliancy, splendour, probably so called
from the splendour of the flowers, is explained by the clause, "that is,
the second month," because the months had no fixed names before the
captivity, and received different names after the captivity. The second
month was called Jyar after the captivity. - The place where the temple
was built is not given in our account, as having been sufficiently well
known; though it is given in the parallel text, [Ch2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001.md), namely, "Mount Moriah, where the
Lord had appeared to David" at the time of the pestilence, and where
David had built an altar of burnt-offering by divine command (see at
[Sa2 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#025).md).

[Kg1 6:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002.md)

Plan and dimensions of the temple-house. - The measure of the
temple-house and its several subdivisions are all given in the clear,
i.e., as the spaces were seen. The house, i.e., the main building of the
temple (lit., as for the house, or shell of the building), its length
was sixty cubits, its breadth twenty cubits, and its height thirty
cubits, and that, according to [Ch2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003.md), "after the earlier measure,"
i.e., after the old Mosaic or sacred cubit, which was a hand-breadth
longer, according to [Eze 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md) and
[Eze 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013.md), than the civil cubit of
the time of the captivity. The Mosaic cubit, according to the
investigations of Thenius, was 214,512 Parisian lines long, i.e., 20 1/2
Dresden inches, or 18 1/2 Rhenish inches (see at [Gen
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#010).md).

[Kg1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003.md)

The porch (lit., hall) in the face of (על־פּני, i.e., before) the Holy
Place of the house was twenty cubits long, before (על־פּני) the breadth
of the house, i.e., it was just the same breadth as the house. The
longer line, which ran parallel to the breadth of the house, is called
here ארך, the length, though from our point of view we should call it
the width. And ten cubits was its breadth, i.e., its depth in front of
the house. The height of the court is not given in our text; but in [Ch2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004.md) it is said to have been 120
cubits. This is certainly an error, although Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 300)
still joins with Stieglitz (Baukunst, p. 126, and Beitrr. zur Gesch. der
Bauk. i. p. 70) in defending its correctness. For an erection of such a
height as this could not possibly have been designated as אוּלם (a hall
or porch), but would have been called מגדּל, a tower. But even a tower
of 120 cubits in height in front of a temple which was only thirty
cubits high, would have shown a greater disproportion than our loftiest
church towers;

(Note: In the Strasburg cathedral and that at Freiburg in Breisgau the
proportion between the height of the tower and that of the church,
together with the roof, is about 3 1/4 to 1; it is only in the cathedral
at Rouen that the proportion would have been almost 4 to 1 if it had
been carried out to the very top. At the same time, in making this
comparison it must be borne in mind that these Gothic towers taper off
into slender points, whereas in the case of Solomon's temple we must
assume that if the porch was carried up to the height supposed, it
finished in a flat truncated tower; and it is this which would chiefly
occasion the disproportion.)

and such a funnel-like erection with a base of only ten cubits in
breadth or depth would hardly have possessed sufficient stability. We
cannot certainly think of an intentional exaggeration of the height in
the Chronicles, since the other measures agree with the account before
us; but the assumption that there has been a corruption of the text is
rendered natural enough by many other errors in the numerical
statements. This still leaves it undecided whether the true height was
twenty or thirty cubits; for whereas the Syriac, Arabic, and lxx (Cod.
Al.) have twenty cubits, the height of thirty cubits is favoured partly
by the omission of any statement of the height from our text, which is
much easier to explain if the porch was of the same height as the
temple-house than if the heights were different, and partly by the
circumstance that the side building had an external height of twenty
cubits, and therefore the porch would not have stood out with any
especial prominence if its elevation had been just the same.

[Kg1 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#004.md)

After the account of the proportionate spaces in the temple-house, the
windows through which it received light and air are mentioned. אטמים
שׁקפים חלּוני does not mean fenestrae intus latae, foris angustae
(Chald., Ar., Rabb., Luther, and others), but windows with closed beams,
i.e., windows the lattice-work of which could not be opened and closed
at pleasure, as in ordinary dwelling-houses ([Kg2
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#017.md); [Dan
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#011).md). For שׁקפים signifies beams
overlaid in [Kg1 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#004.md), and שׁקף beams
in [Kg1 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#005.md). The opening of the
windows was probably narrower without than within, as in the older
Egyptian buildings, as the walls were very strong; and in that case such
windows would more thoroughly answer their purpose, viz., to admit light
and air, and let out the smoke, so that the interpretation given by the
Chaldee is most likely founded upon an ancient tradition, and is in
accordance with the fact, though not with the words. It is a disputed
point among the commentators where the windows were placed: whether
merely in the front over the porch, provided, that is to say, that this
was ten cubits lower than the temple-house, or on the side walls above
the side stories, which were at the most about twenty cubits high, in
which case the Most Holy Place, which was only twenty cubits high,
remained quite dark, according to [Kg1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012.md). We regard the latter view as the
correct one, inasmuch as the objections to it rest upon assumptions
which can be proved to be false.

[Kg1 6:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005.md)

The side building. - [Kg1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005.md). "He
built against the wall of the house an outwork round about (i.e.,
against the two longer sides and against the hinder wall, and not
against the front also, where the porch was built), against the walls of
the house round about, against the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies,
and he made side chambers round about." יצוּע (written constantly יציע
in the Keri) signifies literally stratum, here the lower building or
outwork erected against the rooms mentioned. The word is gen. comm., but
so construed that the masculine is used in a collective sense to denote
the whole of the outworks, consisting as they did of three stories,
whereas the feminine is used for one single story of the building ([Kg1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006).md). On this use of the masculine and
feminine genders to distinguish the whole mass and the individual parts,
which is very common in Arabic, though it is rare in Hebrew, in which
the distinction is generally expressed by a peculiar feminine form. as
for example אני a fleet, and אניּה a single ship, compare Ewald,
Lehrbuch der hebr. Spr. 175, d., and 176, a., and gramm. crit. ling,
arab. i. 295. את־קירות does not mean cum parietibus (Seb. Schmidt and J.
H. Michaelis), but את is a sign of the accusative, "as for the walls,"
and introduces the more precise definition. צלעות signifies, both here
and in [Eze 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006.md)., side chambers or
side stories, from צלע, to incline to one side, hence to limp, i.e., to
lean constantly to one side. From this there were derived for צלע the
meanings side, side piece or side wall, e.g., of the ark, [Exo
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#012.md), [Exo
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#014.md), etc., of the dwelling, [Exo
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#020.md), [Exo
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#026.md), etc., of the altar, [Exo
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#007.md), etc., the side wall or slope of
a mountain, [Sa2 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#013.md), the side
portion of the human body, i.e., the rib, [Gen
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021.md), the sides or leaves of a door
in [Kg1 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#034.md) of the present chapter,
and when used of buildings, the side pieces or portions built out which
lean against the main building; and lastly, the idea of a piece which
shows a large side, i.e., a broad plank ([Kg1
6:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015).md). The meaning planks or beams,
as it were ribs or rib-work, is unfounded.

[Kg1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006.md)

The (internal) breadth of the lower side story was five cubits, that of
the middle one six, and that of the third seven cubits; "for he (they)
had made shortenings (i.e., rebates) against the house round about on
the outside, that (there might be) no insertion into the walls of the
(temple-) house." The meaning is that rebates were attached against the
temple wall, at the point where the lower beams of the different side
stories were to be placed, so that the heads of these beams rested upon
the rebates and were not inserted in the actual wall of the
temple-house. These rebates are called very descriptively מגרעות,
deductions or contractions of the thickness of the wall. We may assume
that there were four such rebates: three for the three floors of the
side stories, and one for the roof. It still remains doubtful, however,
whether these rebates were merely laid along the temple wall, or along
the outer wall of the side building as well, so as to ensure symmetry
and make each of the two walls half a cubit thinner or weaker at every
rebate. The former is the more probable. And accordingly the temple wall
was one cubit weaker at each rebate, that is to say, in four places. If,
therefore, it still remained two cubits thick at the top, it must have
been six cubits thick below. This extraordinary thickness, however,
would be quite in keeping with the remains of buildings of great
antiquity, the walls of which have generally a colossal thickness, and
also with the size of the square stones of which the wall was
constructed, as described in [Kg1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#010.md).

[Kg1 6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#007.md)

[Kg1 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#007.md) contains a circumstantial
clause, inserted as an explanation of [Kg1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006) : "The house, (namely.md) when
building, was built of perfectly finished stones of the quarry, and
hammer and axe; no kind of instrument whatever was heard at the house
when it was building." מסּע שׁלמה אבן (on the construction see Ges. 114,
1, Erl., and Ewald, 339, b.) does not mean stones quite unhewn, which
God had so caused to grow that they did not require to be hewn
(Theodoret); for although שׁלמות אבנים is used in [Deu
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#006.md) (compare with [Exo
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#025).md) to signify uninjured, i.e.,
unhewn stones, yet this meaning is precluded here by the context (cf.
[Kg1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018).md). שׁלם signifies finished
here, that is to say, stones which were so perfectly tooled and prepared
when first broken in the quarry, that when the temple walls were built
no iron instruments were required to prepare them any further. גּרזן, an
axe, here a stone-mason's cutting tool corresponding to the axe. - In
[Kg1 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#008.md) the description of the side
building is continued. "A door (פּתח, a opening for the entrance) to the
middle side chamber (of the lower story) was on the right side (the
southern side) of the house, and a winding staircase led up into the
middle (room of the middle story) and out of the middle into the third
rooms," i.e., the rooms of the third story. This is the rendering
according to the Masoretic text; and the only thing that appears strange
is the use of התּיכנה first of all for the middle room of the lower
story and then for the middle story; and the conjecture is a very
natural one, that the first התּיכנה may have been an error of the pen
for התּחתּנה, in which case הצּלע does not signify the side room, but is
used in a collective sense for the row of side rooms in one story, as in
[Eze 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005.md), [Eze
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#009.md),[Eze
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#011.md). That this door was made from
the outside, i.e., in the outer wall of the side building, and did not
lead into the side rooms "from the interior of the Holy Place," would
hardly need a remark, if Bttcher (Proben alttestl. Schrifterkl. p. 339)
and Schnaase (Gesch. der bildenden Knste, Bd. 1) had not really
supported this view, which is so thoroughly irreconcilable with the
dignity of the sanctuary.

(Note: The perfectly groundless assumption of Thenius, that the outer
building had most probably an inner door as well, which connected it
with the temple, does just as much violence to the decorum of the Holy
Place.)

The only question is, whether it was made in the middle of the right
side or in the front by the side of the porch. If the Masoretic text is
correct, there is no doubt about the former. But if we read התּחתּנה,
the text leaves the question undecided. The winding staircase was not
constructed in the outer wall itself, because this was not thick enough
for the purpose, and the text states pretty clearly that it led from the
lower story into the middle one, and thence still higher, so that it was
in the centre of the building.

[Kg1 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009.md)

In [Kg1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009.md) and [Kg1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#010.md) the description of the exterior
of the temple building is brought to a close. "So he built the house,
and finished it, and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar."
ויּספּן is not to be understood as relating to the internal panelling of
the temple-house, for this is spoken of first in the section which
follows ([Kg1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015).md), but to the
roofing; ספן means to conceal ([Deu
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#021).md) and cover in all the other
passages, even in [Hag 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004.md) and [Jer
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014.md), where ספוּן is generally,
though incorrectly, translated "panelled." As a verb signifying
clothing, it is construed with the accusative. גּבים does not mean
boards, but beams, though not "an arched covering" (Thenius), because
beams cut in the form of an arch would have been too weak in the middle,
nor yet rafters (Bttcher), because the roofs of oriental buildings are
flat. בּארזים שׂדרת, "rows, i.e., tablets (consisting) of cedars," i.e.,
cedar tablets, which were inserted in rows between the beams. This
cedar-work was certainly provided with a strong covering to protect the
roof and the building itself against rain; and at the sides it had no
doubt a parapet, as in the case of dwelling-houses ([Deu
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008).md).

[Kg1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#010.md)

"And he built the outbuildings to the whole house (i.e., all round the
temple-house, with the exception of the front: see [Kg1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005).md); five cubits was its height,"
i.e., the height of each story, the suffix in קומתו being made to agree
with היּצוּע through an inaccuracy which has arisen from condensation,
although, as in [Kg1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005.md), it denotes
the whole of the side buildings, which consisted of three stories. The
height given must also be understood as referring to the height within.
Consequently the side buildings had an internal height of 3 x 5 cubits,
and reckoning the floorings and the roof of the whole building an
external height of 18 or 20 cubits; so that the temple-house, which was
thirty cubits high within and about thirty-two without, rose about
twelve or fourteen cubits above the side building, and there was plenty
of room for the windows in the side walls. וגו ויּאחז: "and it (the side
building) held to the house with cedar beams." The meaning is, that the
building was fastened to the house by the joists of the cedar beams
belonging to the different stories, which rested upon rebates of the
temple wall, so that it was firmly attached to the temple-house, without
any injurious insertions into the sanctuary itself. This is apparently
the only explanation, that can be grammatically sustained, of words that
have received such different interpretations. For the translation given
by Thenius, which coincides with this, - viz., "he fastened it (each
separate story of the building) to the temple-house with cedar wood,
namely, with the cedar beams which formed the flooring and roofing of
the three stores," - is exposed to this grammatical objection, that the
suffix is wanting in יעחז, and that אחז is never followed by את in the
sense of with. All the other explanations are unsuitable. יעחז signifies
neither "he covered the house" (Chald., Vulg., Luther), nor "he overlaid
the house;" moreover, the roofing of the house has been already
mentioned in [Kg1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009.md), and there is no
trace to be found of any overlaying or covering of the outside with
cedar wood.

If, therefore, we reckon the thickness of the temple wall at six cubits,
and that of the outer wall of the side building and the front wall of
the porch at three cubits each, the whole building would be ninety-three
cubits long (externally) and forty-eight cubits broad. The height of the
temple-house was about thirty-two cubits externally, and that of the
side stories from eighteen to twenty cubits, without the socle upon
which the whole building rested. This is not mentioned indeed, as being
a subordinate matter, but would certainly not be omitted.

(Note: Thenius, on the other hand, reckons the length of the whole
building at a hundred cubits and its breadth at fifty-two, because, on
the unfounded assumption that the temple in Ezekiel's vision was simply
a copy of Solomon's temple, he sets down the thickness of the temple
wall in front and along the two sides at six cubits, and that of the
hinder wall at seven. Moreover, he not only reckons the internal length
of the house at sixty-two cubits, in opposition to the statement in the
text, that the length of the house (which was divided into the Holy
Place and the Holy of Holies) was sixty cubits; but in opposition to v.
16, according to which the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies were
separated by boards of cedar, he assumes that there was a wall of two
cubits in thickness between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies,
according to [Eze 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md); and, lastly,
for no other reason than the wish to get the round number 100, he takes
for granted that the hinder wall of the temple was a cubit thicker than
that on the other sides.)

The number of rooms in the side buildings is not given, but may be set
down at thirty in each story, if their length corresponded to their
breadth in the lower story. These rooms had of course windows, although
they are not mentioned in the account, but each one would have only a
small window sufficient to give it the requisite light. And as to the
number of the temple windows also, we can simply make conjectures. We
can hardly assume that there were more than six on each side, and there
were probably none at the back.

Promise of God during the Building of the Temple. - In what way this
promise was communicated to Solomon is not more precisely stated. But
the expression "And the word of Jehovah came" seems to point to a
prophetic medium. And this is in harmony with [Kg1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002.md), according to which Jehovah only
revealed Himself to Solomon twice by an actual appearance.

[Kg1 6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#012.md)

וגו הבּית is placed at the head absolutely: "As for the house which thou
art building (בּנה, a participle), if thou walkest in my statutes, ... I
will set up my word, which I spake to thy father David." The reference
is to the promise in [Sa2 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md). of the
everlasting establishment of this throne. God would fulfil this for
Solomon if he would walk in the commandments of the Lord, as his father
had already urged upon him when he handed over the kingdom ([Kg1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003).md). The promise in [Kg1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#013.md), "I will dwell in the midst of
the children of Israel," does not contain a second promise added to the
one given in [Sa2 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md)., but simply a
special application of it to the building of the temple which had
already been commenced. The eternal establishment of the throne of David
involved the dwelling of God among His people, or rather is founded upon
it. This dwelling of God is now to receive a new and lasting
realization. The temple is to be a pledge that the Lord will maintain
for His people His covenant of grace and His gracious presence. In this
respect the promised, "I will dwell in the midst of the children of
Israel, and not forsake my people Israel," is a confirmation of the word
which Jehovah had spoken to David, although, so far as the actual words
are concerned, it is more closely connected with [Lev
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011.md), when the highest blessing
attendant upon the faithful observance of the commandments of God is
summed up in the promise, "I will make my abode among you, and my soul
will not despise you."

The Internal Arrangements of the Temple-House. - [Kg1
6:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#014.md). Internal covering of the
house, and division into Holy and Most Holy. - [Kg1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#014.md) (cf. [Kg1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009).md) resumes the description of the
building of the temple, which had been interrupted by the divine promise
just communicated.

[Kg1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015.md)

"He built (i.e., so far as the sense is concerned, he covered) the walls
of the house within with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to
the walls of the ceiling he overlaid it with wood within, and overlaid
the floor with cypress boards." The expression הסּפּן קירות, "walls of
the ceiling," is very striking here, and renders it probable that קירות
is only a copyist's error for קורות, "beams of the ceiling." The whole
of the inside of the house was covered with wood, so that nothing was to
be seen of the stone wall ([Kg1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#018).md).
On the other hand, the biblical text knows nothing of any covering of
the outer walls also with wood, as many have assumed.

[Kg1 6:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#016.md)

"And he built אמּה את־עשׂרים, the twenty cubits (i.e., the space of
twenty cubits), of the hindermost side of the house with boards of
cedar," from the floor to the beams (of the roof). עד־הקּירות is to be
explained from הסּפּן קירות עד in [Kg1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015.md). "And built them for it (the
house - לו pointing back to הבּית) into the hinder room, into the Most
Holy." דּביר is more precisely defined by the apposition הקּדשׁים קדשׁ,
and therefore denotes the Most Holy Place. But there is a doubt as to
its derivation and true meaning. Aquila and Symmachus render it
χρηματιστήριον, Jerome λαλητήριον, or in the Vulg. oraculum, so that
they derive it from דּבר, to speak; and Hengstenberg adopts this
derivation in [Psa 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md) : דּביר, lit.,
that which is spoken, then the place where the speaking takes place.
Most of the more recent commentators, on the other hand, follow the
example of C. B. Michaelis and J. Simonis, and render it, after the
Arabic, the hinder portion or back room, which is favoured by the
antithesis לפני היכל, the front sanctuary ([Kg1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#017).md). The words of the text,
moreover, are not to be understood as referring to a cedar wall in front
of the Most Holy Place which rose to the height of twenty cubits, but to
all four walls of the Most Holy Place, so that the wall which divided
the hinder room from the Holy Place is not expressly mentioned, simply
because it is self-evident. The words also imply that the whole of the
hinder space of the house to the length of twenty cubits was cut off for
the Most Holy Place, and therefore the party wall must also have filled
the whole height of the house, which was as much as thirty cubits, and
reached, as is expressly stated, from the floor to the roof. There
remained therefore forty cubits of the house (in length) for לפני היכל,
the front palace, i.e., the Holy Place of the temple ([Kg1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#017).md). לפני, anterior, formed from
לפני (cf. Ewald, 164, a.). - In [Kg1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#018.md) there is inserted in a
circumstantial clause the statement as to the internal decoration of
both rooms; and the further description of the Most Holy Place is given
in [Kg1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#019.md). "And cedar wood was
(placed) against the house inside, sculpture of gourds (colocynthides)
and open buds." מקלעת is in apposition to ארז, containing a more minute
description of the nature of the covering of cedar. מקלעת signifies
sculpture, half-raised work (basso relievo); not, however, "that kind of
bas-relief in which the figures, instead of rising above the surface on
which they are wrought, are simply separated from it by the chiselling
out of their outlines, and their being then rounded off according to
these outlines" (Thenius). For although the expression מקלעות פּתּוּחי
([Kg1 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029).md) appears to favour this,
yet "merely engraved work" does not harmonize with the decorations of
the brazen stands in [Kg1 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#031.md), which
are also called מקלעות. פּקעים are figures resembling the פּקּעת, or
wild gourds ([Kg2 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039).md), i.e., oval
ornaments, probably running in straight rows along the walls. צצּים
פּטוּרי are open flower-buds; not hangings or garlands of flowers
(Thenius), for this meaning cannot be derived from פּטר in the sense of
loosening or setting free, so as to signify flowers loosened or set free
(= garlands), which would be a marvellous expression! The objection
that, "flowers not yet opened, i.e., flower-buds, were not צצּים, but
פּרחים," rests upon a false interpretation of the passage referred to.

[Kg1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#019.md)

"And (= namely) he prepared a hinder room in the house within, to place
the ark of the covenant of Jehovah there." תתּן, as [Kg1
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#014.md) shows, is not a future (ut
reponeres), but the infinitive תּת with a repeated syllable תן (see
Ewald, 238, c.).

[Kg1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020.md)

"And the interior of the hinder room was twenty cubits the length,
twenty cubits the breadth, and twenty cubits its height." The word לפני
I agree with Kimchi in regarding as the construct state of the noun
לפנים, which occurs again in [Kg1 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029.md)
in the sense of the inner part or interior, as is evident from the
antithesis לחיצום (on the outside). "And he overlaid it with fine gold."
סגוּר זהב (= סגור =( ז in [Job 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#015).md)
unquestionably signifies fine or costly gold, although the derivation of
this meaning is still questionable; viz., whether it is derived from סגר
in the sense of to shut up, i.e., gold shut up or carefully preserved,
after the analogy of כּתם; or is used in the sense of taking out or
selecting, i.e., gold selected or pure; or in the sense of closed, i.e.,
gold selected or pure; or in the sense of closed, i.e., gold condensed
or unadulterated (Frst and Delitzsch on [Job
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#015).md).

The Most Holy Place had therefore the form of a perfect cube in the
temple as well as in the tabernacle, only on an enlarged scale. Now, as
the internal elevation of the house, i.e., of the whole of the
temple-house, the hinder portion of which formed the Most Holy Place,
was thirty cubits, there was a space of about ten cubits in height above
the Most Holy Place and below the roof of the temple-house for the upper
rooms mentioned in [Ch2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#009.md), on the
nature and purpose of which nothing is said in the two accounts.

(Note: This upper room does not presuppose, however, that the party
wall, which follows as a matter of course from [Kg1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#016.md), was not merely a cedar wall, but
a wall two cubits thick. The supposed difficulty of setting up a cedar
wall thirty cubits high is not so great as to necessitate assumptions
opposed to the text. For we cannot possibly see why it could not have
been made secure "without injuring the temple wall." The wood panelling
must have been nailed firmly to the wall without injuring the wall
itself; and therefore this could be done just as well in the case of the
cedar beams or boards of the party wall.)

"And he overlaid (clothed) the altar with cedar wood." There is
something very striking in the allusion to the altar in this passage,
since the verse itself treats simply of the Most Holy Place; and still
more striking is the expression לדּביר אשׁר המּזבּח, "the altar
belonging to the Debir," in [Kg1 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#022.md),
since there was no altar in the Most Holy Place. We cannot remove the
strangeness of these sentences by such alterations as Thenius and
Bttcher propose, because the alterations suggested are much too
complicated to appear admissible. The allusion to the altar in both
these verses is rather to be explained from the statements in the
Pentateuch as to the position of the altar of incense; viz., [Exo
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006.md), "Thou shalt place it before the
curtain, which is above the ark of the testimony before the capporeth
over the testimony;" and [Exo 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#005.md),
"before the ark of the testimony;" whereby this altar, although actually
standing "before the inner curtain," i.e., in the Holy Place, according
to [Exo 40:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#026.md), was placed in a closer
relation to the Most Holy Place than the other two things which were in
the Holy Place. The clothing of the altar with cedar presupposes that it
had a heart of stone; and the omission of the article before מזבּח may
be explained on the ground that it is mentioned here for the first time,
just as in [Kg1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#016.md), where דּביר was
first mentioned, it had no article.

[Kg1 6:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#021.md)

To the gilding of the Most Holy Place, and the allusion to the altar of
incense, which in a certain sense belonged to it, there is now appended
in [Kg1 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#021.md) the gilding of the Holy
Place. "Solomon overlaid the house from within with fine gold." מפּנימה
הבּית cannot be the party wall between the Holy Place and the Most Holy,
as I formerly supposed, but is the Holy Place as distinguished from the
Most Holy. The following words וגו ויעבּר are very obscure. If we
rendered them, "he caused to pass over in (with) golden chains before
the hinder room," we could only think of an ornament consisting of
golden chains, which ran along the wall in front of the hinder room and
above the folding doors. But this would be very singularly expressed. We
must therefore take עבּר, as Gesenius, de Wette, and many of the earlier
commentators do, according to the Chaldaean usage in the sense of
bolting or fastening: "he bolted (fastened) with golden chains before
the hinder room;" and must assume with Merz and others that the doors
into the Most Holy Place (except on the day of atonement) were closed
and fastened with golden chains, which were stretched across the whole
breadth of the door and stood out against the wall.

(Note: The conjecture of Thenius, that את־הפּרכת (the curtain) has
dropped out of the text and should be restored ("he carried the curtain
across with golden chains"), is very properly described by Merz as
"certainly untenable," since, apart from the fact that not one of the
older versions contains the missing words, chains would have impeded the
moving of the curtain. It is true that, according to [Ch2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#014.md), there was a curtain before the
Most Holy Place; but as it is not mentioned so early as this even in the
Chronicles, this would not be its proper position in the account before
us, but it would be most suitably mentioned either in connection with or
after the reference to the doors of the Most Holy Place in [Kg1
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#031.md), [Kg1
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#032)..md)

\- The following expression, זהב ויצפּהוּ, "and he overlaid it with
gold," can only refer to the altar mentioned in the previous verse, the
gilding of which has not yet been noticed, however surprising the
separation of these words from [Kg1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020.md) may be. - In [Kg1
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#022.md) what has already been stated with
regard to the gilding is repeated once more in a comprehensive manner,
which brings this subject to a close. The whole house (כּל־הבּית) is the
Holy Place and the Most Holy, but not the porch or hall, as this is
expressly distinguished from the house. המּזבּח, the whole altar, not
merely a portion of it.

[Kg1 6:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#023.md)

The large cherub-figures in the Most Holy Place. - [Kg1
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#023). He made (caused to be made.md) in
the hinder room two cherubs of olive wood, i.e., wood of the oleaster or
wild olive-tree, which is very firm and durable, and, according to [Ch2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#010.md), צעצעים מעשׂה, i.e., according to
the Vulgate, opus statuarium, a peculiar kind of sculpture, which cannot
be more precisely defined, as the meaning of צוּע is uncertain. "Ten
cubits was the height of it" (i.e., of the one and of the other). The
figures had a human form, like the golden cherubs upon the ark of the
covenant, and stood upright upon their feet ([Ch2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#013).md), with extended wings of five
cubits in length, so that one wing of the one reached to one wing of the
other in the centre of the room, and the other wing of each reached to
the opposite wall, and consequently the four extended wings filled the
entire breadth of the Most Holy Place ( a breadth of twenty cubits), and
the two cherubs stood opposite to one another and ten cubits apart. The
wings were evidently fastened to the back and placed close to one
another upon the shoulder-blades, so that the small space between their
starting-points is not taken into consideration in the calculation of
their length. The figures were completely overlaid with gold. The ark of
the covenant was placed between these cherubs, and under the wings which
pointed towards one another. As they were made like those upon the ark,
they had evidently the same meaning, and simply served to strengthen the
idea which was symbolized in the cherub, and which we have expounded in
the Commentary on [Exo 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020.md). Only
their faces were not turned towards one another and bent down towards
the ark, as in the case of the golden cherubim of the ark; but,
according to [Ch2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#013.md), they were
turned לבּית, towards the house, i.e., the Holy Place, so as to allow of
the extension of the wings along the full length of the Most Holy Place.

[Kg1 6:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029.md)

Ornaments of the walls; the floors and doors. - [Kg1
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029.md). All the walls of the house (the
Holy Place and the Most Holy) round about (מסב, adverb) he made engraved
work (carving) of cherubs, palms, and open flowers from within to the
outside (i.e., in the Most Holy as well as in the Holy Place). ול...מן =
אל...מן; and לפנים as in [Kg1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020.md).
This completes the account of the nature of the covering of wood. In
addition to the oval figures and open flowers ([Kg1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#018).md), there were also figures of
cherubim and palm-trees carved in the wooden panels. Nothing is said as
to the distribution of these figures. But a comparison with [Eze
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#018.md) shows at any rate so much, that
the palm-trees alternated with the cherubs, so that there was always one
cherub standing between two palm-trees. The gourd-shaped figures and the
open flowers probably formed the upper and lower setting of the rows of
palms and cherubs, the flowers hanging in the form of garlands above the
palms and cherubs, and the rows of gourds arranged in bars constituting
the boundary lines both above and blow. It is a disputed question
whether there was only one row of palms and cherubs running round the
walls, or whether there were two, or possibly even three. There is more
probability in the second or third of these assumptions than in the
first, inasmuch as on the walls of the Egyptian temples there were often
three or four rows of mythological characters in relief arranged one
above another (compare my work on the Temple, pp. 70ff.).

[Kg1 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#030.md)

The floor of the house he overlaid with gold within and without, i.e.,
in the Most Holy Place and in the Holy Place also.

[Kg1 6:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#031.md)

He made the entrance to the back room, doors (i.e., consisting of doors;
cf. Ewald, 284, a., β) of olive wood, which moved, according to [Kg1
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050.md), on golden hinges. וגו האיל, "the
projection of the door-posts was fifth" (מזוּזות( " is construed freely
as an explanatory apposition to האיל, to which it is really subordinate;
cf. Ewald, 290, e.). These obscure words, which have been interpreted in
very different ways (see Ges. Thes. pp. 43f.), can hardly have any other
meaning than this: the projecting framework of the doors occupied the
fifth part of the breadth of the wall. For the explanation given by
Bttcher and Thenius, "the entrance framework with posts of fifth
strength," has no real support in [Eze
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md). To justify the rendering given
to המשּׁית (fifth strength), האיל is supplied, though not in the sense
of projection, but in the thoroughly unwarranted sense of strength or
thickness of the wall; and in addition to this, a wall two cubits thick
is postulated between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, in direct
contradiction to [Kg1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#016.md). The
further evidence, which Thenius finds in [Kg1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008.md), in support of this explanation,
has been already rejected by Bttcher as unsustained. It would indeed be
extremely strange for the thickness of the door-posts which formed the
setting of the entrance to be given, whereas nothing is said about the
size of the doors. According to our explanation, "a fifth of the breadth
of the wall," the entrance was four cubits broad including the
projecting door-posts, and each of the two wings of the folding doors
about a cubit and a half broad, if we reckon the projecting framework on
either side at half a cubit in breadth.

[Kg1 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#032.md)

"And two doors (i.e., folding doors, sc. he made; וּשׁתּי is also
governed by עשׂה in [Kg1 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#031).md) of
olive wood, and carved upon them carved work," etc., as upon the walls
([Kg1 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029).md), "and overlaid them with
gold, spreading the gold upon the cherubs and palms" (ירד, hiphil of
רדד), i.e., he spread gold-leaf upon them, so that, as Rashi observes,
all the figures, the elevations and depressions of the carved work, were
impressed upon the coating of gold-leaf, and were thus plainly seen.
Thenius infers from this explanatory clause, that the gilding upon the
walls and doors was most probably confined to the figures engraved, and
did not extend over the whole of the walls and doors, because, if the
doors had been entirely overlaid with gold, the gilding of the carved
work upon them would have followed as a matter of course. But this
inference is a very doubtful one. For if it followed as a matter of
course from the gilding of the entire doors that the carved work upon
them was overlaid with gold, it would by no means follow that the
overlaying was such as to leave the carved work visible or prominent,
which this clause affirms. Moreover, a partial gilding of the walls
would not coincide with the expression כּל־הבּית עד־תּם in [Kg1
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#022.md), since these words, which are
used with emphasis, evidently affirm more than "that such (partial)
gilding was carried out everywhere throughout the temple proper." The
doors in front of the Most Holy Place did not render the curtain
mentioned in [Ch2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#014.md) unnecessary, as
many suppose. This curtain may very well have been suspended within the
doors; so that even when the doors were opened outwards on the entrance
of the high priest, the curtain formed a second covering, which
prevented the priests who were ministering in the Holy Place and court
from looking in.

(Note: H. Merz (Herzog's Cycl.) now admits this, whereas he formerly
agreed with Ewald and others in denying the existence of the curtain in
Solomon's temple, and regarded the curtain (veil) in [Mat
27:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051.md) as an arbitrary addition made
by Herod out of his princely caprice, thus overlooking the deep
symbolical meaning which the veil or curtain possessed.)

[Kg1 6:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#033.md)

"And thus he made upon the door of the Holy Place posts of olive wood
from a fourth (of the wall)," i.e., a framework which occupied a fourth
of the breadth of the wall, or was five cubits broad (see at [Kg1
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#031).md), "and two doors of cypress wood,
two leaves each door turning," i.e., each of the folding doors
consisting of two leaves, each of which was made to turn by itself, so
that it could be opened and shut alone (without the other; קלעים is
probably only a copyist's error for צלעים). Cypress wood was chosen for
the folding doors of the Holy Place, and not olive wood, as in the case
of the Most Holy Place, probably because it is lighter in weight, and
therefore less likely to sink. It is questionable here what idea we are
to form of the division of each folding door into two leaves, each of
which turned by itself: whether we are to think of each wing as divided
lengthwise into two narrow leaves, or as divided half way up, so that
the lower half could be opened without the upper. I agree with Merz in
thinking the latter the more probable assumption; for the objection made
by Thenius, on the ground that doors of this kind are only seen in the
houses of the peasantry, is an idle assertion which cannot be proved. In
a doorway of five cubits in breadth, after reckoning the doorposts the
width of the two wings could not be more than two cubits each. And if
such a door had been divided into two halves, each half would have been
only one cubit wide, so that when open it would not have furnished the
requisite room for one man conveniently to pass through. On the other
hand, we may assume that a folding door of four cubits in breadth, if
made in just proportions, would be eight cubits high. And a door of such
a height might easily be divided into two halves, so that only the lower
half (of two cubits in breadth and about four in height) was opened for
the daily entrance of the priests into the Holy Place. These doors
probably opened outwards, like those in front of the Most Holy Place.

[Kg1 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#035.md)

Carving and gilding: as upon the doors before the hinder room. The gold
was levelled or smoothed over that which had been engraved, i.e., it was
beaten out thin and laid upon the carving in such a manner that the gold
plate fitted closely to the figures. Gilding was generally effected in
ancient times by the laying on of gold plate, which was fastened with
tacks (compare [Ch2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#009).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 6:36</span></span>

The courts. - "He built the inner court three rows of hewn stones and
one row of hewn cedar beams." The epithet inner court applied to the
"court of the priests" ([Ch2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009).md)
presupposes an outer one, which is also mentioned in [Ch2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009.md), and called "the great court." The
inner one is called the upper (higher) court in [Jer
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010.md), from which it follows that it
was situated on a higher level than the outer one, which surrounded it
on all sides. It was enclosed by a low wall, consisting of three rows of
hewn stones, or square stones, laid one upon another, and a row of hewn
cedar beams, which were either laid horizontally upon the stones, after
the analogy of the panelling of the temple walls on the inside, or
placed upright so as to form a palisading, in order that the people
might be able to see through into the court of the priests. According to
[Ch2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009.md), the outer court had gates
lined with brass, so that it was also surrounded with a high wall.
Around it there were chambers and cells ([Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md); [Jer
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#004.md); [Jer
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010).md) for the priests and Levites,
the plans for which had already been made by David ([Ch1
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012).md). The principal gate was the
east gate ([Eze 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001).md). Other gates are
mentioned in [Kg2 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#006.md); [Ch2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#005.md), [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md) [Kg2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#010.md); [Ch2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#008.md). The size of these courts is not
given. At the same time, following the analogy of the tabernacle, and
with the reduplication of the rooms of the tabernacle which is adopted
in other cases in the temple, we may set down the length of the court of
the priests from east to west at 200 cubits, and the breadth from south
to north at 100 cubits; so that in front of the temple-building on the
east there was a space of 100 cubits in length and breadth, or 10,000
square cubits, left free for the altar of burnt-offering and the other
vessels, in other words, for the sacrificial worship. The outer or great
court will therefore, no doubt, have been at least twice as large,
namely, 400 cubits long and 200 cubits broad, i.e., in all, 80,000
square cubits; so that the front space before the court of the priests
(on the eastern side) was 150 cubits long from east to west, and 200
cubits broad from south to north, and 50 cubits in breadth or depth
still remained for the other three sides.

The time consumed in building. - The foundation was laid in the fourth
year in the month Ziv (see [Kg1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001).md),
and it was finished in the eleventh year in the month Bul, i.e., the
eighth month, so that it was built in seven years, or, more precisely,
seven years and a half, "according to all its matters and all its due."
בּוּל for יבוּל signifies proventus; בּוּל ירח is therefore the fruit
month, the month of tree fruits. The name probably originated with the
Phoenicians, with whom the fruit ripened later; and it is said to be
found upon the great Sidonian inscription (compare Dietrich on Ges. Lex.
s. v.). For the other explanations see Ges. Thes. p. 560. In comparison
with other large buildings of antiquity,

(Note: According to Pliny (H. N. 36, c. 14), all Asia was building at
the celebrated temple of Diana at Ephesus for 220 years.)

and also of modern times, the work was executed in a very short time.
But we must bear in mind that the building was not a very large one,
notwithstanding all its splendour; that an unusually large number of
workmen were employed upon it; and that the preparation of the
materials, more especially the hewing of the stones, took place at
Lebanon, and for the most part preceded the laying of the foundation of
the temple, so that this is not to be included in the seven years and a
half.

Moreover, the period mentioned probably refers to the building of the
temple-house and court of the priests only, and to the general
arrangement of the outer court, and does not include the completion of
the underground works which were necessary to prepare the space required
for them, and of which only a portion may have been carried out by
Solomon.

(Note: The account given by Josephus of these substructures does not
show very clearly how much originated with Solomon, and how much belongs
to the following centuries. At the close of his description of Solomon's
temple (Ant. viii. 3, 9), he states that, in order to obtain the same
level for the ἔξωθεν ἱερόν, i.e., the outer court of the temple, as that
of the ναός, he had large valleys filled up, into which it was difficult
to look down on account of their depth, by raising the ground to the
height of 400 cubits, so as to make them level with the top of the
mountain; and in the de Bell. Jud. v. 5, 1, after describing the
temple-mountain as a mighty hill, the summit of which hardly sufficed
for the temple-house and altar when the building was commenced, because
it sloped off on all sides, he adds: "Solomon therefore caused a wall to
be raised on the eastern side, and had a porch built upon the ground
that was heaped up, and on the other sides the temple (ναός) was naked
(γυμνός)." But in the description of the temple of Herod (Ant. xv. 11,
3) he says: "The temple was surrounded by enormous porticos (στοαί),
which rested upon a large wall, and were the largest work of which men
have ever heard. It was a steep rocky hill, rising gradually towards the
eastern part of the city up to the highest point. This hill Solomon
surrounded with a wall by very great works up to the very apex, and
walled it round, commencing at the root, which is surrounded by a deep
ravine, with stones which were fastened together with lead, ... and
continuing to the top, so that the size and height of the building,
which was completed as a square, were immense," etc. The flat obtained
in this manner is then described by Josephus as a περίβολος of four
stadia in circumference, namely, one stadium on each side. Now, although
it was the outer court of the temple of Herod (the court of the
Gentiles) which first had this circumference (see my bibl. Archol. i.
pp. 143,144), and Josephus, de Bell. Jud. v. 5, 1, relates that
subsequently (τοῖς ἑξῆς αἰῶσιν) the levelling of the hill was carried
out to even a greater extent, as the people still continued to heap up
earth, it is quite conceivable that Solomon may have planned the area of
the temple with this circumference. And this conjecture acquires great
probability from the fact that, according to the researches of Robinson
(Pal. i. pp. 420ff.; Recent Investigations concerning the Topography of
Jerusalem, pp. 68ff.; and Later Biblical Researches, pp. 173ff.), there
are layers of enormous square stones in the lowest part of the
south-western and south-eastern corners of the present Haram wall, the
dimensions of which, apart from the fact that they are hewn with grooved
edges, point to an early Israelitish origin, so that they might very
well be relics of the Solomonian substructures of the temple-hill. There
is also a remnant of the arch of a bridge of the same construction on
the southern portion of the western wall of the Haram, which points to a
bridge that led across from Moriah to Zion, and "appears to remove all
the objections to the identity of this part of the enclosure of the
mosque with that of the ancient temple" (Rob. Pal. i. p. 426). "Here
then," adds Robinson (Pal. i. pp. 427,428), "we have indisputable
remains of Jewish antiquity, consisting of an important portion of the
western wall of the ancient temple area. They are probably to be
referred to a period long antecedent to the days of Herod; for the
labours of this splendour-loving tyrant appear to have been confined to
the body of the temple and the porticos around the court. The magnitude
of the stones also, and the workmanship, as compared with other
remaining monuments of Herod, seem to point to an earlier origin. In the
accounts we have of the destruction of the temple by the Chaldaeans, and
its rebuilding by Zerubbabel under Darius, no mention is made of these
exterior walls. The former temple was destroyed by fire, which would not
affect these foundations; nor is it probable that a feeble colony of
returning exiles could have accomplished works like these. There seems,
therefore, little room for hesitation in referring them back to the days
of Solomon, or rather of his successors, who, according to Josephus,
built up here immense walls, 'immoveable for all time.' "

But however probable this assumption may be, the successors of Solomon
cannot come into consideration at all, since Josephus says nothing of
the kind, and the biblical accounts are not favourable to this
conjecture. With the division of the kingdom after the death of Solomon
the might of the kings of Judah was broken; and the accounts of the new
court which Jehoshaphat built, i.e., of the restoration of the inner
court ([Ch2 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#005).md), and of the repairs
of the temple by Joash ([Kg2 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#005.md).;
[Ch2 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#004)..md) and Josiah ([Kg2
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#005.md).; [Ch2
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008)..md), do not produce the impression
that the walls so costly or so large could have been built at that time.
The statement of Josephus (l.c. de Bell. Jud. v. 5, 1) concerning the
gradual extension of the levelled hill, has reference to the enlargement
of the temple area towards the north, inasmuch as he adds to the words
already quoted: "and cutting through the north wall, they took in as
much as was afterwards occupied by the circumference of the whole
temple." - If, therefore, the remains of the ancient wall which have
been mentioned, with their stones of grooved edges, are of early
Israelitish origin, we must trace them to Solomon; and this is favoured
still further by the fact, that when Solomon had a magnificent palace
built for himself opposite to the temple (see [Kg1
7:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001).md), he would assuredly connect
the temple-mountain with Zion by a bridge. - Even J. Berggren (Bibel u.
Josephus ber Jerus. u. d. heil. Grab.) thinks it probable that "the
so-called remains of an arch in the western Haram wall may be, as
Robinson at first indicated, a relic of that ancient and marvellous
xystus bridge, with which the Davidic steps on the two steep sides of
the valley of the Tyropoeum, constructed for the purpose of going from
Moriah to Zion or from Zion to Moriah, were connected.")

The importance of the temple is clearly expressed in [Kg1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#013.md), [Kg1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027.md); [Kg1
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#003.md); [Ch2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#002.md), and other passages. It was to be
a house built as the dwelling-place for Jehovah, a place for His seat
for ever; not indeed in any such sense as that the house could contain
God within its space, when the heavens of heavens cannot contain Him
([Kg1 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027).md), but a house where the
name of Jehovah is or dwells ([Kg1
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#016.md).; [Ch2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#005.md); cf. [Sa2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013), etc..md), i.e., where God manifests
His presence in a real manner to His people, and shows Himself to them
as the covenant God, so that Israel may there worship Him and receive an
answer to its prayers. The temple had therefore the same purpose as the
tabernacle, whose place it took, and which it resembled in its
fundamental form, its proportions, divisions, and furniture. As the
glory of the Lord entered into the tabernacle in the cloud, so did it
into the temple also at its dedication, to sanctify it as the place of
the gracious presence of God ([Kg1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md); [Ch2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014).md). The temple thereby became not
only a visible pledge of the lasting duration of the covenant, by virtue
of which God would dwell among His people, but also a copy of the
kingdom of God, which received at its erection an embodiment answering
to its existing condition at the time. As the tabernacle, with its
resemblance to a nomad's tent, answered to the time when Israel had not
yet found rest in the promised land of the Lord; so was the temple,
regarded as an immoveable house, a pledge that Israel had not acquired
its lasting inheritance in Canaan, and that the kingdom of God on earth
had obtained a firm foundation in the midst of it. - This relation
between the temple and the tabernacle will serve to explain all the
points of difference which present themselves between these two
sanctuaries, notwithstanding their agreement in fundamental forms and in
all essential particulars. As a house or palace of Jehovah, the temple
was not only built of solid and costly materials, with massive walls of
square stones, and with floors, ceilings, walls, and doors of cedar,
cypress, and olive woods - these almost imperishable kinds of wood - but
was also provided with a hall like the palaces of earthly kings, and
with side buildings in three stories in which to keep the utensils
requisite for a magnificent ceremonial, though care was taken that there
adjoining and side buildings were not attached directly to the main
building so as to violate the indestructibility and perfectness of the
house of God, but merely helped to exalt it and elevate its dignity. And
the increased size of the inner rooms, whilst the significant forms and
measures of the tabernacle were preserved, was also essentially
connected with this. Whereas the length and breadth of the dwelling were
doubled, and the height of the whole house tripled, the form of a cube
was still retained for the Most Holy Place as the stamp of the perfected
kingdom of God (see Comm. on Pent. p. 441), and the space was fixed at
twenty cubits in length, breadth, and height. On the other hand, in the
case of the Holy Place the sameness of height and breadth were
sacrificed to the harmonious proportions of the house or palace, as
points of inferior importance; and the measurements were thirty cubits
in height, twenty cubits in breadth, and forty cubits in length; so that
ten as the number of perfectness was preserved as the standard even
here. And in order to exhibit still further the perfectness and glory of
the house of God, the walls were not constructed of ordinary
quarry-stone, but of large square stones prepared at the quarry, and the
walls were panelled within with costly wood after the manner of the
palaces of Hither Asia, the panelling being filled with carved work and
overlaid with gold plate. And whereas the overlaying of the whole of the
interior with gold shadowed forth the glory of the house as the
residence of the heavenly King, the idea of this house of God was still
more distinctly expressed in the carved work of the walls. In the
tabernacle the walls were decorated with tapestries in costly colours
and interwoven figures of cherubim; but in the temple they were
ornamented with carved work of figures of cherubim, palms, and opening
flowers. To the figures of cherubim, as representations of the heavenly
spirits which surround the Lord of glory and set forth the psychical
life at its highest stage, there are thus added flowers, and still more
particularly palms, those "princes of the vegetable kingdom," which,
with their fine majestic growth, and their large, fresh, evergreen
leaves, unite within themselves the whole of the fulness and glory of
the vegetable life; to set forth the sanctuary (probably with special
reference to Canaan as the land of palms, and with an allusion to the
glory of the King of peace, inasmuch as the palm is not only the sign of
Palestine, but also the symbol of peace) "as a place that was ever
verdant, abiding in all the freshness of strength, and enfolding within
itself the fulness of life," and thereby to make it a scene of health
and life, of peace and joy, a "paradise of God," where the righteous who
are planted there flourish, and blossom, and bear fruit to old age ([Psa
92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013).md). And this idea of the house, as
an immoveable dwelling-place of God, is in perfect harmony with the
setting up of two colossal cherubim in the Most Holy Place, which filled
the whole space with their outspread wings, and overshadowed the ark of
the covenant, to show that the ark of the covenant with its small golden
cherubim upon the Capporeth, which had journeyed with the people through
the desert to Canaan, was henceforth to have there a permanent and
unchangeable abode.
