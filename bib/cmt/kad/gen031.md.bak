### [Genesis Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 31:1</span></span>

The Flight. - Through some angry remarks of Laban's sons with reference
to his growing wealth, and the evident change in the feelings of Laban
himself towards him ([Gen 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001.md), [Gen
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#002).md), Jacob was inwardly prepared for
the termination of his present connection with Laban; and at the same
time he received instructions from Jehovah, to return to his home,
together with a promise of divine protection. In consequence of this, he
sent for Rachel and Leah to come to him in the field, and explained to
them ([Gen 31:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#004).md), how their
father's disposition had changed towards him, and how he had deceived
him in spite of the service he had forced out of him, and had altered
his wages ten times; but that the God of his father had stood by him,
and had transferred to him their father's cattle, and now at length had
directed him to return to his home.

[Genesis 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 31:6</span></span>

אתּנה: the original form of the abbreviated אתּן, which is merely copied
from the Pentateuch in [Exo 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#011.md),
[Exo 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#020.md); [Exo
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#017.md).

[Genesis 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 31:9</span></span>

אביכם: for אביכן as in [Gen 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#016.md),
etc. - "Ten times:" i.e., as often as possible, the ten as a round
number expressing the idea of completeness. From the statement that
Laban had changed his wages ten times, it is evident that when Laban
observed, that among his sheep and goats, of one colour only, a large
number of mottled young were born, he made repeated attempts to limit
the original stipulation by changing the rule as to the colour of the
young, and so diminishing Jacob's wages. But when Jacob passes over his
own stratagem in silence, and represents all that he aimed at and
secured by crafty means as the fruit of God's blessing, this differs no
doubt from the account in Gen 30. It is not a contradiction, however,
pointing to a difference in the sources of the two chapters, but merely
a difference founded upon actual fact, viz., the fact that Jacob did not
tell the whole truth to his wives. Moreover self-help and divine help do
not exclude one another. Hence his account of the dream, in which he saw
that the rams that leaped upon the cattle were all of various colours,
and heard the voice of the angel of God calling his attention to what
had been seen, in the words, "I have seen all that Laban hath done to
thee," may contain actual truth; and the dream may be regarded as a
divine revelation, which was either sent to explain to him now, at the
end of the sixth year, "that it was not his stratagem, but the
providence of God which had prevented him from falling a victim to
Laban's avarice, and had brought him such wealth" (Delitzsch); or, if
the dream occurred at an earlier period, was meant to teach him, that
"the help of God, without any such self-help, could procure him justice
and safety in spite of Laban's selfish covetousness" (Kurtz). It is very
difficult to decide between these two interpretations. As Jehovah's
instructions to him to return were not given till the end of his period
of service, and Jacob connects them so closely with the vision of the
rams that they seem contemporaneous, Delitzsch's view appears to deserve
the preference. But the עשׂה in [Gen
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#012.md), "all that Laban is doing to
thee," does not exactly suit this meaning; and we should rather expect
to find עשׂה used at the end of the time of service. The participle
rather favours Kurtz's view, that Jacob had the vision of the rams and
the explanation from the angel at the beginning of the last six years of
service, but that in his communication to his wives, in which there was
no necessity to preserve a strict continuity or distinction of time, he
connected it with the divine instructions to return to his home, which
he received at the end of his time of service. But if we decide in
favour of this view, we have no further guarantee for the objective
reality of the vision of the rams, since nothing is said about it in the
historical account, and it is nowhere stated that the wealth obtained by
Jacob's craftiness was the result of the divine blessing. The attempt so
unmistakeably apparent in Jacob's whole conversation with his wives, to
place his dealing with Laban in the most favourable light for himself,
excites the suspicion, that the vision of which he spoke was nothing
more than a natural dream, the materials being supplied by the three
thoughts that were most frequently in his mind, by night as well as by
day, viz., (1) his own schemes and their success; (2) the promise
received at Bethel; (3) the wish to justify his actions to his own
conscience; and that these were wrought up by an excited imagination
into a visionary dream, of the divine origin of which Jacob himself may
not have had the slightest doubt. - In [Gen
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#013.md) האל has the article in the
construct state, contrary to the ordinary rule; cf. Ges. 110, 2b; Ewald,
290.

[Genesis 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 31:14</span></span>

The two wives naturally agreed with their husband, and declared that
they had no longer any part or inheritance in their father's house. For
he had not treated them as daughters, but sold them like strangers,
i.e., servants. "And he has even constantly eaten our money," i.e.,
consumed the property brought to him by our service. The inf. abs. אכול
after the finite verb expresses the continuation of the act, and is
intensified by גם "yes, even." כּי in [Gen
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#016.md) signifies "so that," as in [Deu
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#024.md); [Job
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#006.md).

[Genesis 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 31:17</span></span>

Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; Jacob
then set out with his children and wives, and all the property that he
had acquired in Padan-Aram, to return to his father in Canaan; whilst
Laban had gone to the sheep-shearing, which kept him some time from his
home on account of the size of his flock. Rachel took advantage of her
father's absence to rob him of his teraphim (penates), probably small
images of household gods in human form, which were worshipped as givers
of earthly prosperity, and also consulted as oracles (see my Archologie,
90).

[Genesis 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 31:20</span></span>

"Thus Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he
fled;" - לב גּנב to steal the heart (as the seat of the understanding),
like κλέπτειν νοο͂ν, and גּנב with the simple accus. pers., [Gen
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#027.md), like κλεπτειν τίνα, signifies
to take the knowledge of anything away from a person, to deceive him; -
"and passed over the river (Euphrates), and took the direction to the
mountains of Gilead."

[Genesis 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 31:22</span></span>

Laban's Pursuit, Reconciliation, and Covenant with Jacob. - As Laban was
not told till the third day after the flight, though he pursued the
fugitives with his brethren, i.e., his nearest relations, he did not
overtake Jacob for seven days, by which time he had reached the
mountains of Gilead ([Gen 31:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#022).md).
The night before he overtook them, he was warned by God in a dream, "not
to speak to Jacob from good to bad," i.e., not to say anything decisive
and emphatic for the purpose of altering what had already occurred
(vid., [Gen 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029.md), and the note on
[Gen 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#050).md). Hence he confined
himself, when they met, "to bitter reproaches combining paternal feeling
on the one hand with hypocrisy on the other;" in which he told them that
he had the power to do them harm, if God had not forbidden him, and
charged them with stealing his gods (the teraphim).

[Genesis 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 31:26</span></span>

"Like sword-booty;" i.e., like prisoners of war ([Kg2
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#022).md) carried away unwillingly and by
force.

[Genesis 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 31:27</span></span>

"So I might have conducted thee with mirth and songs, with tabret and
harp," i.e., have sent thee away with a parting feast.

[Gen 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#028.md)

עשׂו: an old form of the infinitive for עשׂות as in [Gen
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#011.md); [Gen
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#020.md).

[Genesis 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 31:29</span></span>

ידי לאל ישׁ: "there is to God my hand" ([Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md); cf. [Deu
28:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#032.md); [Neh
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005).md), i.e., my hand serves me as God
([Hab 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011.md); [Job
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006).md), a proverbial expression for
"the power lies in my hand."

[Genesis 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 31:30</span></span>

"And now thou art gone (for, if thou art gone), because thou longedst
after thy father's house, why hast thou stolen my gods?" The meaning is
this: even if thy secret departure can be explained, thy stealing of my
gods cannot.

[Genesis 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 31:31</span></span>

The first, Jacob met by pleading his fear lest Laban should take away
his daughters (keep them back by force). "For I said:" equivalent to
"for I thought." But Jacob knew nothing of the theft; hence he declared,
that with whomsoever he might find the gods he should be put to death,
and told Laban to make the strictest search among all the things that he
had with him. "Before our brethren," i.e., the relations who had come
with Laban, as being impartial witnesses (cf. [Gen
31:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#037).md); not, as Knobel thinks, before
Jacob's horde of male and female slaves, of women and of children.

[Genesis 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 31:33</span></span>

Laban looked through all the tents, but did not find his teraphim; for
Rachel had put them in the saddle of her camel and was sitting upon
them, and excused herself to her lord (Adonai, [Gen
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#035).md), on the ground that the custom
of women was upon her. "The camel's furniture," i.e., the saddle (not
"the camel's litter:" Luther), here the woman's riding saddle, which had
a comfortable seat formed of carpets on the top of the packsaddle. The
fact that Laban passed over Rachel's seat because of her pretended
condition, does not presuppose the Levitical law in [Lev
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019.md)., according to which, any one
who touched the couch or seat of such a woman was rendered unclean. For,
in the first place, the view which lies at the foundation of this law
was much older than the laws of Moses, and is met with among many other
nations (cf. Bhr, Symbolik ii. 466, etc.); consequently Laban might
refrain from making further examination, less from fear of defilement,
than because he regarded it as impossible that any one with the custom
of women upon her should sit upon his gods.

[Genesis 31:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">gen 31:36</span></span>

As Laban found nothing, Jacob grew angry, and pointed out the injustice
of his hot pursuit and his search among all his things, but more
especially the harsh treatment he had received from him in return for
the unselfish and self-denying services that he had rendered him for
twenty years. Acute sensibility and elevated self-consciousness give to
Jacob's words a rhythmical movement and a poetical form. Hence such
expressions as אחרי דּלק "hotly pursued," which is only met with in [Sa1
17:53](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#053.md); אחטּנּה for אחטּאנּה "I had to
atone for it," i.e., to bear the loss; "the Fear of Isaac," used as a
name for God, פּחד, σέβας = σέβασμα, the object of Isaac's fear or
sacred awe.

[Genesis 31:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">gen 31:40</span></span>

"I have been; by day (i.e., I have been in this condition, that by day)
heat has consumed (prostrated) me, and cold by night" - for it is well
known, that in the East the cold by night corresponds to the heat by
day; the hotter the day the colder the night, as a rule.

[Genesis 31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">gen 31:42</span></span>

"Except the God of my father...had been for me, surely thou wouldst now
have sent me away empty. God has seen mine affliction and the labour of
my hands, and last night He judged it." By the warning given to Laban,
God pronounced sentence upon the matter between Jacob and Laban,
condemning the course which Laban had pursued, and still intended to
pursue, towards Jacob; but not on that account sanctioning all that
Jacob had done to increase his own possessions, still less confirming
Jacob's assertion that the vision mentioned by Jacob ([Gen
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#011.md), [Gen
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#012).md) was a revelation from God. But
as Jacob had only met cunning with cunning, deceit with deceit, Laban
had no right to punish him for what he had done. Some excuse may indeed
be found for Jacob's conduct in the heartless treatment he received from
Laban, but the fact that God defended him from Laban's revenge did not
prove it to be right. He had not acted upon the rule laid down in [Pro
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#022.md) (cf. [Rom
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017.md); [Th1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015).md).

[Genesis 31:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">gen 31:43</span></span>

These words of Jacob "cut Laban to the heart with their truth, so that
he turned round, offered his hand, and proposed a covenant." Jacob
proceeded at once to give a practical proof of his assent to this
proposal of his father-in-law, by erecting a stone as a memorial, and
calling upon his relations also ("his brethren," as in [Gen
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#023.md), by whom Laban and the relations
who came with him are intended, as [Gen
31:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#054) shows.md) to gather stones into a
heap, which formed a table, as is briefly observed in [Gen
31:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#046.md), for the covenant meal ([Gen
31:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#054).md). This stone-heap was called
Jegar-Sahadutha by Laban, and Galeed by Jacob (the former is the
Chaldee, the latter the Hebrew; they have both the same meaning, viz.,
"heaps of witness"),

(Note: These words are the oldest proof, that in the native country of
the patriarchs, Mesopotamia, Aramaean or Chaldaean was spoken, and
Hebrew in Jacob's native country, Canaan; from which we may conclude
that Abraham's family first acquired the Hebrew in Canaan from the
Canaanites (Phoenicians).)

because, as Laban, who spoke first, as being the elder, explained, the
heap was to be a "witness between him and Jacob." The historian then
adds this explanation: "therefore they called his name Gal'ed," and
immediately afterwards introduces a second name, which the heap received
from words that were spoken by Laban at the conclusion of the covenant
([Gen 31:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#049).md): "And Mizpah," i.e.,
watch, watch-place (sc., he called it), "for he (Laban) said, Jehovah
watch between me and thee; for we are hidden from one another (from the
face of one another), if thou shalt oppress my daughters, and if thou
shalt take wives to my daughters! No man is with us, behold God is
witness between me and thee!" ([Gen
31:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#049.md), [Gen
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050).md). After these words of Laban,
which are introduced parenthetically,

(Note: There can be no doubt that [Gen
31:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#049.md) and [Gen
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050.md) bear the marks of a subsequent
insertion. But there is nothing in the nature of this interpolation to
indicate a compilation of the history from different sources. That
Laban, when making this covenant, should have spoken of the future
treatment of his daughters, is a thing so natural, that there would have
been something strange in the omission. And it is not less suitable to
the circumstances, that he calls upon the God of Jacob, i.e., Jehovah,
to watch in this affair. And apart from the use of the name Jehovah,
which is perfectly suitable here, there is nothing whatever to point to
a different source; to say nothing of the fact that the critics
themselves cannot agree as to the nature of the source supposed.)

and in which he enjoined upon Jacob fidelity to his daughters, the
formation of the covenant of reconciliation and peace between them is
first described, according to which, neither of them (sive ego sive tu,
as in [Exo 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013).md) was to pass the
stone-heap and memorial-stone with a hostile intention towards the
other. Of this the memorial was to serve as a witness, and the God of
Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father (Terah), would be
umpire between them. To this covenant, in which Laban, according to his
polytheistic views, placed the God of Abraham upon the same level with
the God of Nahor and Terah, Jacob swore by "the Fear of Isaac" ([Gen
31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042).md), the God who was worshipped by
his father with sacred awe. He then offered sacrifices upon the
mountain, and invited his relations to eat, i.e., to partake of a
sacrificial meal, and seal the covenant by a feast of love.

The geographical names Gilead and Ramath-mizpeh ([Jos
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026).md), also Mizpeh-Gilead ([Jdg
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029).md), sound so obviously like Gal'ed
and Mizpah, that they are no doubt connected, and owe their origin to
the monument erected by Jacob and Laban; so that it was by prolepsis
that the scene of this occurrence was called "the mountains of Gilead"
in [Gen 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#021.md), [Gen
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#023.md), [Gen
31:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#025.md). By the mount or mountains of
Gilead we are not to understand the mountain range to the south of the
Jabbok (Zerka), the present Jebel Jelaad, or Jebel es Salt. The name
Gilead has a much more comprehensive signification in the Old Testament;
and the mountains to the south of the Jabbok are called in [Deu
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012.md) the half of Mount Gilead; the
mountains to the north of the Jabbok, the Jebel-Ajlun, forming the other
half. In this chapter the name is used in the broader sense, and refers
primarily to the northern half of the mountains (above the Jabbok); for
Jacob did not cross the Jabbok till afterwards ([Gen
32:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#023).md). There is nothing in the
names Ramath-mizpeh, which Ramoth in Gilead bears in [Jos
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026.md), and Mizpeh-Gilead, which it
bears in [Jdg 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md), to compel us to
place Laban's meeting with Jacob in the southern portion of the
mountains of Gilead. For even if this city is to be found in the modern
Salt, and was called Ramath-mizpeh from the even recorded here, all that
can be inferred from that is, that the tradition of Laban's covenant
with Jacob was associated in later ages with Ramoth in Gilead, without
the correctness of the association being thereby established.
