### [Exodus Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001)

[Exodus 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 36:2</span></span>

Moses then summoned the master-builders named, and all who were skilled
in art, "every one whom his heart lifted up to come near to the work to
do it" (i.e., who felt himself stirred up in heart to take part in the
work), and handed over to them the heaven-offering presented by the
people for that purpose, whilst the children of Israel still continued
bringing freewill-offerings every morning.

[Exodus 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 36:4</span></span>

Then the wise workmen came, every one from his work that they were
making, and said to Moses, "Much make the people to bring, more than
suffices for the labour (the finishing, as in [Exo
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#019)) of the work," i.e., they are
bringing more than will be wanted for carrying out the work (the מן in
מדּי is comparative); whereupon Moses let the cry go through the camp,
i.e., had proclamation made, "No one is to make any more property (מלאכה
as in [Exo 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#007), [Exo
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#010), cf. [Gen
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#014)) for a holy heave-offering,"
i.e., to prepare anything more from his own property to offer for the
building of the sanctuary; and with this he put a stop to any further
offerings.

[Exodus 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 36:7</span></span>

"And there was enough (דּיּם their sufficiency, i.e., the requisite
supply for the different things to be made) of the property for every
work to make it, and over" (lit., and to leave some over). By this
liberal contribution of freewill gifts, for the work commanded by the
Lord, the people proved their willingness to uphold their covenant
relationship with Jehovah their God.

[Exodus 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 36:8</span></span>

Ex 36:8-38:20. Execution of the Work. - Preparation of the
dwelling-place: viz., the hangings and covering ([Exo
36:8-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#008), as in [Exo
26:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001)); the wooden boards and bolts
([Exo 36:20-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#020), as in Ex 26:15-30);
the two curtains, with the pillars, hooks, and rods that supported them
([Exo 36:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#035), as in [Exo
26:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031)). As these have all been
already explained, the only thing remaining to be noticed here is, that
the verbs עשׂה in [Exo 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#008), ויחבּר in
[Exo 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#010), etc., are in the third
person singular with an indefinite subject, corresponding to the German
man (the French on).
