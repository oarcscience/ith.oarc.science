### [Proverbs Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 2:1</span></span>

The first אם, with that which it introduces, [Pro
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md), [Pro
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#002.md), is to be interpreted as an
exclamation, "O that!" (O si), and then as an optative, as [Psa
81:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#009.md); [Psa
139:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#019.md). אז ...כּי, [Pro
2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#003.md), with the inserted connecting
clauses, would then be confirmatory, "for then." But since this poet
loves to unfold one and the same thought in ever new forms, one has
perhaps to begin the conditional premisses with [Pro
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md), and to regard כּי אם as a new
commencement. Hitzig takes this כי אם in the sense of imo: "much more if
thou goest to meet her, e.g., by curious inquiry, not merely permittest
her quietly to come to thee." אם would then preserve its conditional
meaning; and כּי as in [Job 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#018.md);
[Psa 130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md), since it implies an
intentional negative, would receive the meaning of imo. But the
sentences ranged together with אם are too closely related in meaning to
admit such a negative between them. כּי will thus be confirmatory, not
mediately, but immediately; it is the "for = yes" of confirmation of the
preceding conditions, and takes them up again (Ewald, 356, b, cf. 330 b)
after the form of the conditional clause was given up. The צפן, which in
[Pro 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011.md), [Pro
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#018.md), is the synonym of צפה,
speculari, presents itself here, 1b, 7a, as the synonym of טמן, whence
מטמנים, synon. of צפוּנים, recondita; the group of sounds, צף, צם, טם
(cf. also דף, in Arab. dafan, whence dafynat, treasure), express shades
of the root representation of pressing together. The inf. of the
conclusion להקשׁיב, to incline (Gr. Venet. ὡς ἀκροῷτο), is followed by
the accus. of the object אזנך, thine ear, for הקשׁיב properly means to
stiffen (not to purge, as Schultens, nor to sharpen, as Gesenius
thinks); cf. under [Psa 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md). With
חכמה are interchanged בּינה, which properly means that which is
distinguished or separated, and תּבוּנה, which means the distinguishing,
separating, appellations of the capacity of distinguishing in definite
cases and in general; but it does not represent this as a faculty of the
soul, but as a divine power which communicates itself as the gift of God
(charisma).

[Proverbs 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 2:3</span></span>

Instead of כּי אם there is an old אל תקרי

(Note: Regarding this formula, see Strack's Prolegomena, pp. 66-70.)

(read not so, but thus), כי אם (if thou callest understanding mother),
which supposes the phrase כי אם (lxx) as traditional. If אם were
intended (according to which the Targ. in the Bibl. rabbinica, but not
in Norzi's text, translates), then 3b would correspond; vid., [Pro
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#004.md), cf. [Job
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#014.md). Thus: Yea, if thou callest for
understanding, i.e., callest her to thee ([Pro
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006).md), invitest her to thee ([Pro
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#015).md). The ק of בּקּשׁ is, with the
exception of the imper. (e.g., בּקּשׁוּ), always without the Dagesh.
[Pro 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#004.md) belongs to the ideas in the
Book of Job found in these introductory discourses, cf. [Job
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#021.md), as at [Pro
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#014.md), [Job
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#022) (Ewald, Sprche, p. 49.md). חפשׂ
(חפּשׂ), scrutari, proceeds, as חפס shows, from the primary meaning of a
ditch, and is thus in its root-idea related to חפר (to dig, search out).
In the principal clause of [Pro 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#005.md)
the 'יראת ה, as [Psa 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010.md), is the
fear of Jahve as it ought to be, thus the reverence which is due to Him,
the worshipping of Him as revealed. 'ה and אלהים are interchanged as
קדשׁים and 'ה at [Pro 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md). דּעת is
knowledge proceeding from practice and experience, and thus not merely
cognition (Kenntnis), but knowledge (Erkenntnis). The thoughts revolve
in a circle only apparently. He who strives after wisdom earnestly and
really, reaches in this way fellowship with God; for just as He gives
wisdom, it is nowhere else than with Him, and it never comes from any
other source than from Him. It comes ([Pro
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006).md) מפּיו (lxx erroneously מפּניו
ylsuoe), i.e., it is communicated through the medium of His word, [Job
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#022.md), or also (for λὀγος and πνεῦμα
lie here undistinguished from one another) it is His breath (Book of
Wisdom 7:25: ἀτμὶς τῆς τοῦ Θεοῦ δυνάμεως καὶ ἀπόῤῥοια τῆς τοῦ
παντοκράτορος δόξης εἰλικρινής); the inspiration (נשׁמת) of the Almighty
(according to [Job 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008).md) gives men
understanding. In [Pro 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007.md), whether
וצפן (Chethı̂b) or יצפּן (Kerı̂) is read, the meaning is the same. The
former is the expression of the completed fact, as ἡτοίμασεν, [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md), and is rightly preferred by lxx
and Syr., for one reluctantly misses the copula (since the thought is
new in comparison with [Pro 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006).md).
לישׁרם should be written with the accent Dech. The Chokma-word (besides
in Proverbs and Job, found only in [Mic
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009.md) and [Isa
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029).md) תּוּשׁיּה is a Hiphil formation
(with the passing over of into , as in תּוּגה) from הושׁה (whence the
pr. names יושׁה and יושׁויה) = (Arab.) wasy and âsy, to re-establish, to
advance, Hiph. of ישׁה = ושׁה, to stand, and thus means furtherance,
i.e., the power or the gift to further, and concretely that which
furthers and profits, particularly true wisdom and true fortune.

(Note: I was formerly in error in regarding the word as a Hophal
formation, and in assigning to it the primary signification of being in
a state of realized existence, of reality, in contradistinction to
appearance only. The objection of J. D. Michaelis, Supplem. p. 1167, Non
placent in linguis ejusmodi etyma metaphysica, etc., does not apply
here, since the word is a new one coined by the Chokma, but all the
shades of meaning are naturally derived from the fundamental
signification "furtherance" (cf. Seneca, Deus stator stabilitorque est).
"תושׁיה, from Arab. âsy and wasy, to further by word and deed, to assist
by counsel and act, to render help, whence the meanings auxilium, salus,
and prudens consilium, sapientia, easily follow; cf. Ali's Arab.
proverb, "He furthers thee, who does not trouble himself about thee.")

The derivation from ישׁ ([Pro 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#021).md) is
to be rejected, because "the formation would be wholly without analogy,
so much the more because the י of this word does not represent the place
of the ו, as is seen from the Arab. l-ys and the Syr. lyt" (Fl.);

(Note: The Arab. ‛aysa (almost only in the negative la-ysa = לא ישׁ), of
the same signification as ישׁ, with which the Aram. אית (איתי) is
associated, presupposes an ‛âsa (= ‛âssa), to be founded, to found, and
is rightly regarded by the Arabs as an old segolate noun in which the
verbal force was comprehended.)

and the derivation of ושׁה = שׁוה, to be smooth (Hitzig), passes over
without any difficulty into another system of roots.

(Note: The Arab. wsy and swy are confounded in common usage (Wetstein,
Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr. xxii. 19), but the roots וש and שו are
different; וש and אש, on the contrary, are modifications of one root.)

In the passage under consideration ([Pro
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007).md), תּוּשׁיּה signifies advancement
in the sense of true prosperity. The parallel passage 7a clothes itself
in the form of an apposition: (He) a shield (מגן, n. instr. of גּנן, to
cover) for הלכי תּם, pilgrims of innocence (Fl.), i.e., such as walk in
the way (the object-accus., as [Pro
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012.md), for which in [Pro
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009) בּ.md) of innocence. תּם is whole,
full submission, moral faultlessness, which chooses God with the whole
heart, seeks good without exception: a similar thought is found in [Psa
84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012.md). לנצר, 8a, is such an inf. of
consequence as להקשׁיב ([Pro 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#002).md), and
here, as there, is continued in the finite. The "paths of justice" are
understood with reference to those who enter them and keep in them;
parallel, "the way of His saints" (חסיד, he who cherishes חסד, earnest
inward love to God), for that is just ארח־צדקה ([Pro
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028).md): they are הלכי צדקות ([Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015).md). Instead of the Mugrash, the
conjunctive Tarcha is to be given to ודרך.

[Proverbs 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 2:9</span></span>

With the אז repeated, the promises encouraging to the endeavour after
wisdom take a new departure:

9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and justice,

And uprightness; every way of good.

10 For wisdom will enter into thine heart,

And knowledge will do good to thy soul;

11 Discretion will keep watch over thee,

Understanding will keep thee.

Regarding the ethical triad מישׁרים \[righteousness, rightness\], משׁפּט
\[judgment\], and צדק \[rectitude\], vid., [Pro
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003.md). Seb. Schmid is wrong in his
rendering, et omnis via qua bonum aditur erit tibi plana, which in
comparison with [Isa 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#007.md) would be
feebly expressed. J. H. Michaelis rightly interprets all these four
conceptions as object-accusatives; the fourth is the summarizing
asyndeton (cf. [Psa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#007).md) breaking off
the enumeration: omnem denique orbitam boni; Jerome, bonam: in this
case, however, טוב would be genitive (vid., [Pro
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#002).md). מעגּל is the way in which the
chariot rolls along; in עגל there are united the root-conceptions of
that which is found (גל) and rolling (גל). Whether כּי, [Pro
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md), is the argumentative "because"
(according to the versions and most interpreters) or "for" ("denn," J.
H. Michaelis, Ewald, and others), is a question. That with כּי = "for"
the subject would precede the verb, as at [Pro
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006.md), [Pro
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#021.md), and [Pro
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032) (Hitzig.md), determines nothing, as
[Pro 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018.md) shows. On the one hand, the
opinion that כּי = "because" is opposed by the analogy of the כּי, [Pro
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006.md), following אז, [Pro
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#005.md); the inequality between [Pro
2:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#005.md) and [Pro
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#009.md). if the new commencement, [Pro
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#009.md), at once gives place to another,
[Pro 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md); the relationship of the
subject ideas in [Pro 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md), [Pro
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#011.md), which makes [Pro
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#011.md) unsuitable to be a conclusion
from [Pro 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md). On the contrary, the
promise not only of intellectual, but at the same time also of
practical, insight into the right and the good, according to their whole
compass and in their manifoldness, can be established or explained quite
well as we thus read [Pro 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md), [Pro
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#011.md) : For wisdom will enter (namely,
to make it a dwelling-place, [Pro
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#033.md); cf. [Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023).md) into thine heart, and knowledge
will do good to thy soul (namely, by the enjoyment which arises from the
possession of knowledge, and the rest which its certainty yields). דּעת,
γνῶσις, is elsewhere fem. ([Psa
139:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#006).md), but here, as at [Pro
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#010.md); [Pro
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006.md), in the sense of τὸ γνῶναι, is
masc. In [Pro 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#011.md) the contents of the
אז תבין ([Pro 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#009).md) are further
explained. שׁמר על, of watching (for [Job
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016.md) is to be interpreted
differently), is used only by our poet (here and at [Pro
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#022).md). Discretion, i.e., the capacity
of well-considered action, will hold watch over thee, take thee under
protection; understanding, i.e., the capacity in the case of opposing
rules to make the right choice, and in the matter of extremes to choose
the right medium, will be bestowed upon thee. In תּנצרכּה, as in [Psa
61:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#008.md); [Psa
140:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002.md), [Psa
140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005.md); [Deu
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md), etc., the first stem letter is
not assimilated, in order that the word may have a fuller sound; the
writing כּה for ך is meant to affect the eye.

(Note: For the right succession of the accents here, see Torath Emeth,
p. 49, 5; Accentuationssystem, xviii. 3.)

[Proverbs 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 2:12</span></span>

As in [Pro 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md), [Pro
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#011.md), the אז תּבּין ("then shalt thou
understand," [Pro 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#005).md) is expanded, so
now the watching, preserving, is separately placed in view:

12 To deliver thee from an evil way,

From the man who speaks falsehood;

13 (From those) who forsake the ways of honesty

To walk in ways of darkness,

14 Who rejoice to accomplish evil,

Delight in malignant falsehood -

15 They are crooked in their paths,

And perverse in their ways.

That דּרך רע is not genitival, via mali, but adjectival, via mala, is
evident from דרך לא־טוב, [Pro 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#029.md).
From the evil way, i.e., conduct, stands opposed to the false words
represented in the person of the deceiver; from both kinds of contagium
wisdom delivers. תּהפּכות (like the similarly formed תּחבּות, occurring
only as plur.) means misrepresentations, viz., of the good and the true,
and that for the purpose of deceiving ([Pro
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020).md), fallaciae, i.e., intrigues in
conduct, and lies and deceit in words. Fl. compares Arab. ifk, a lie,
and affak, a liar. להצּילך has Munach, the constant servant of Dech,
instead of Metheg, according to rule (Accentssystem, vii. 2). העזבים
([Pro 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#013).md) is connected with the
collective אישׁ (cf. [Jdg 9:55](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#055).md); we
have in the translation separated it into a relative clause with the
abstract present. The vocalization of the article fluctuates, yet the
expression העזבים, like [Pro 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md)
העזבת, is the better established (Michlol 53b); העזבים is one of the
three words which retain their Metheg, and yet add to it a Munach in the
tone-syllable (vid., the two others, [Job
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#004.md); [Job
39:26](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#026).md). To the "ways of honesty"
(Geradheit) (cf. the adj. expression, [Jer
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009).md), which does not shun to come to
the light, stand opposed the "ways of darkness," the ἔργα τοῦ σκότους,
[Rom 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012.md), which designedly conceal
themselves from God ([Isa 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015).md) and
men ([Job 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#015.md); [Job
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#013.md), [Job
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#015).md).

[Pro 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#014.md)

In this verse the regimen of the מן, 12b, is to be regarded as lost; the
description now goes on independently. Whoever does not shrink back from
evil, but gives himself up to deceit, who finally is at home in it as in
his own proper life-element, and rejoices, yea, delights in that which
he ought to shun as something destructive and to be rejected. The neut.
רע is frequently an attributive genit., [Pro
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#024.md); [Pro
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#026.md); [Pro
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#005.md); cf. טוב, [Pro
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#025.md), which here, since תּהפּכות are
those who in themselves are bad, does not separate, but heightens:
perversitates non simplices aut vulgares, sed pessimae et ex omni parte
vitiosae (J. H. Michaelis). With אשׁר (οἵτινες), [Pro
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015.md), this part is brought to a
conclusion. Fleischer, Bertheau, and others interpret ארחתיהם, as the
accus. of the nearer definition, as σκολιὸς τὸν νοῦν, τὰς πράξεις; but
should it be an accus., then would we expect, in this position of the
words, עקּשׁוּ ([Isa 59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008.md); [Pro
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008.md), cf. [Pro
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#015).md). עקּשׁים is the pred.; for ארח,
like דּרך, admits of both genders. וּנלוזים carries in it its subject
הם; לוּז, like the Arab. l'd, l'dh, is a weaker form of לוּץ, flectere,
inclinare, intrans. recedere: they are turned aside, inclined out of the
way to the right and left in their walk (בּ as [Pro
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020).md).

[Proverbs 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 2:16</span></span>

With the resumption of להצּילך, the watchful protection which wisdom
affords to its possessors is further specified in these verses:

16 To save thee from the strange woman,

From the stranger who useth smooth words;

The subject here continued is the fourfold wisdom named in [Pro
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md), [Pro
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#011.md). זר signifies alienus, which may
also be equivalent to alius populi, but of a much wider compass - him
who does not belong to a certain class (e.g., the non-priestly or the
laity), the person or thing not belonging to me, or also some other than
I designate; on the other hand, נכרי, peregrinus, scarcely anywhere
divests itself of the essential mark of a strange foreign origin. While
thus אשּׁה זרה is the non-married wife, נכריּה designates her as
non-Israelitish. Prostitution was partly sanctioned in the cultus of the
Midianites, Syrians, and other nations neighbouring to Israel, and thus
was regarded as nothing less than customary. In Israel, on the contrary,
the law ([Deu 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018)..md) forbade it under
a penalty, and therefore it was chiefly practised by foreign women ([Pro
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#027.md), and cf. the exception, [Rut
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#010).md),

(Note: In Talmudic Heb. ארמית (Aramean) has this meaning for the
Biblical נכריּה.)

an inveterate vice, which spread itself particularly from the latter
days of Solomon, along with general ungodliness, and excusing itself
under the polygamy sanctioned by the law, brought ruin on the state. The
Chokma contends against this, and throughout presents monogamy as alone
corresponding to the institution and the idea of the relation.
Designating marriage as the "covenant of God," it condemns not only
adulterous but generally promiscuous intercourse of the sexes, because
unhallowed and thus unjustifiable, and likewise arbitrary divorce.
Regarding the ancient ceremonies connected with the celebration of
marriage we are not specially informed; but from [Pro
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md), [Mal
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014.md) (Ewald, Bertheau, Hitzig, but not
Khler), it appears that the celebration of marriage was a religious act,
and that they who were joined together in marriage called God to witness
and ratify the vows they took upon themselves. The perf. in the
attributive clause אמריה החליקה proceeds on the routine acquired in
cajoling and dissembling: who has smoothed her words, i.e., learned to
entice by flattering words (Fl.).

[Proverbs 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 2:17</span></span>

17 Who forsakes the companion of her youth,

And forgets the covenant of her God;

18 For she sinks down to death together with her house,

And to the shadow of Hades her paths -

19 All they who go to her return not again,

And reach not the paths of life

אלּוּף, as here used, has nothing to do with the phylarch-name, similar
in sound, which is a denom. of אלף; but it comes immediately from אלף,
to accustom oneself to a person or cause, to be familiar therewith
(while the Aram. אלף, ילף, to learn, Pa. to teach), and thus means, as
the synon. of רע, the companion or familiar associate (vid., Schultens).
Parallels such as [Jer 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004.md) suggested
to the old interpreters the allegorical explanation of the adulteress as
the personification of the apostasy or of heresy. [Pro
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018.md) the lxx translate: ἔθετο γὰρ παρὰ
τῷ θανάτῳ τὸν οἶκον αὐτῆς: she (the dissolute wife) has placed her house
beside death (the abyss of death). This שׁחה \[ἔθετο\] is perhaps the
original, for the text as it lies before us is doubtful, though, rightly
understood, admissible. The accentuation marks בּיתהּ as the subject,
but בּית is elsewhere always masc., and does not, like the rarer ארח,
[Pro 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015.md), admit in usage a double
gender; also, if the fem. usage were here introduced (Bertheau, Hitzig),
then the predicate, even though ביתה were regarded as fem., might be, in
conformity with rule, שׁח, as e.g., [Isa
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017.md). שׁחה is, as in [Psa
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#026.md), 3rd pr. of שׁוּח, Arab. sâkh,
to go down, to sink; the emendation שׁחה (Joseph Kimchi) does not
recommend itself on this account, that שׁחה and שׁחח mean, according to
usage, to stoop or to bend down; and to interpret (Ralbag, השׁפילה) שׁחה
transitively is inadmissible. For that reason Aben Ezra interprets ביתה
as in apposition: to death, to its house; but then the poet in that case
should say אל־שׁאול, for death is not a house. On the other hand, we
cannot perceive in ביתה an accus. of the nearer definition (J. H.
Michaelis, Fl.); the expression would here, as 15a, be refined without
purpose. Bttcher has recognised ביתה as permutative, the personal
subject: for she sinks down to death, her house, i.e., she herself,
together with all that belongs to her; cf. the permutative of the
subject, [Job 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#003.md); [Isa
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023) (vid., comm. l.c..md), and the more
particularly statement of the object, [Exo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006.md), etc. Regarding רפאים, shadows of
the under-world (from רפה, synon. חלה, weakened, or to become
powerless), a word common to the Solomonic writings, vid., Comment. on
Isaiah, p. 206. What [Pro 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018.md) says of
the person of the adulteress, [Pro
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#019.md) says of those who live with her
ביתה, her house-companions. בּאיה, "those entering in to her," is
equivalent to בּאים אליה; the participle of verbs eundi et veniendi
takes the accusative object of the finite as gen. in st. constr., as
e.g., [Pro 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#012.md); [Pro
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007.md); [Gen
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#018.md); [Gen
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#010.md) (cf. [Jer
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020).md). The ישׁוּבוּן, with the tone
on the ult., is a protestation: there is no return for those who
practise fornication,

(Note: One is here reminded of the expression in the Aeneid, vi.
127-129:

Revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras,

Hoc opes, hoc labor est.

See also an impure but dreadful Talmudic story about a dissolute Rabbi,
b. Aboda zara, 17a.)

and they do not reach the paths of life from which they have so widely
strayed.

(Note: In correct texts ולא־ישיגו has the Makkeph. Vid., Torath Emeth,
p. 41; Accentuationssystem, xx. 2.)

[Proverbs 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 2:20</span></span>

With למען there commences a new section, coordinating itself with the
להצּילך ("to deliver thee") of [Pro
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012.md), [Pro
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md), unfolding that which wisdom
accomplishes as a preserver and guide:

20 So that thou walkest in the good way,

And keepest the right paths.

21 For the upright shall inhabit the land,

And the innocent shall remain in it.

22 But the godless are cut off out the land,

And the faithless are rooted out of it.

Wisdom - thus the connection - will keep thee, so that thou shalt not
fall under the seductions of man or of woman; keep, in order that
thou... למען (from מען = מענה, tendency, purpose) refers to the
intention and object of the protecting wisdom. To the two negative
designations of design there follows, as the third and last, a positive
one. טובים (contrast to רעים, [Pro
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#019).md) is here used in a general
ethical sense: the good (Guten, not Gtigen, the kind). שׁמר, with the
object of the way, may in another connection also mean to keep oneself
from, cavere ab ([Psa 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004).md); here it
means: carefully to keep in it. The promise of [Pro
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#021.md) is the same as in the Mashal [Psa
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#009.md), [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011.md), [Psa
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#022.md); cf. [Pro
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#030.md). ארץ is Canaan, or the land
which God promised to the patriarchs, and in which He planted Israel,
whom He had brought out of Egypt; not the earth, as [Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md), according to the extended,
unlimited N.T. circle of vision. יוּתרוּ (Milel) is erroneously
explained by Schultens: funiculis bene firmis irroborabunt in terra. The
verb יתר, Arab. watar, signifies to yoke (whence יתר, a cord, rope),
then intrans. to be stretched out in length, to be hanging over (vid.,
Fleischer on [Job 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#011).md); whence יתר,
residue, [Zep 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009.md), and after which the
lxx here renders ὑπολειφθήσονται, and Jerome permanebunt. In 22b the old
translators render יסּחוּ as the fut. of the pass. נסּח, [Deu
28:63](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063.md); but in this case it would be
ינּסחוּ. The form יסּחוּ, pointed יסּחוּ, might be the Niph. of סחח, but
סחח can neither be taken as one with נסח, of the same meaning, nor with
Hitzig is it to be vocalized יסּחוּ (Hoph. of נסח); nor, with Bttcher
(1100, p. 453), is יסּחוּ to be regarded as a veritable fut. Niph.
יסּחוּ is, as at [Pro 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#025.md); [Psa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007.md), active: evellant; and this, with
the subj. remaining indefinite (for which J. H. Michaelis refers to [Hos
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009).md), is equivalent to evellentur.
This indefinite "they" or "one" ("man"), Fleischer remarks, can even be
used of God, as here and [Job 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#003.md) - a
thing which is common in Persian, where e.g., the expression rendered
hominem ex pulvere fecerunt is used instead of the fuller form, which
would be rendered homo a Deo ex pulvere factus est. בּוגדים bears (as
בּגד proves) the primary meaning of concealed, i.e., malicious
(treacherous and rapacious, [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001).md), and then faithless men.

(Note: Similar is the relation in Arab. of labbasa to libâs (לבוּשׁ); it
means to make a thing unknown by covering it; whence telbı̂s, deceit,
mulebbis, a falsifier.)
