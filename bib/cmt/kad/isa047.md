### [Isaiah Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 47:1</span></span>

From the gods of Babylon the proclamation of judgment passes onto
Babylon itself. "Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter
Babel; sit on the ground without a throne, O Chaldaeans-daughter! For
men no longer call thee delicate and voluptuous. Take the mill, and
grind meal: throw back they veil, lift up the train, uncover the thigh,
wade through streams. Let thy nakedness be uncovered, even let thy shame
be seen; I shall take vengeance, and not spare men. Our Redeemer,
Jehovah of hosts is His name, Holy One of Israel." This is the first
strophe in the prophecy. As v. 36 clearly shows, what precedes is a
penal sentence from Jehovah. Both בּת in relation to בּתוּלת ([Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012.md); [Isa
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#022).md), and בּבל and כּשׂדּים in
relation to בּת, are appositional genitives; Babel and Chaldeans (כשׂדים
as in [Isa 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020).md) are regarded as a
woman, and that as one not yet dishonoured. The unconquered oppressor is
threatened with degradation from her proud eminence into shameful
humiliation; sitting on the ground is used in the same sense as in [Isa
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026.md). Hitherto men have called her,
with envious admiration, rakkâh va‛ânuggâh (from [Deu
28:56](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056).md), mollis et delicata, as having
carefully kept everything disagreeable at a distance, and revelled in
nothing but luxury (compare ‛ōneg, [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022).md). Debauchery with its attendant
rioting ([Isa 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011.md); [Isa
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#005).md), and the Mylitta worship with
its licensed prostitution (Herod. i. 199), were current there; but now
all this was at an end. תוסיפי, according to the Masora, has only one
pashta both here and in [Isa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005.md), and
so has the tone upon the last syllable, and accordingly metheg in the
antepenult. Isaiah's artistic style may be readily perceived both in the
three clauses of [Isa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md) that are
comparable to a long trumpet-blast (compare [Isa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009.md) and [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001).md), and also in the short, rugged,
involuntarily excited clauses that follow. The mistress becomes the
maid, and has to perform the low, menial service of those who, as Homer
says in Od. vii. 104, ἀλετρεύουσι μύλης ἔπι μήλοπα καρπόν (grind at the
mill the quince-coloured fruit; compare at [Job
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#010).md). She has to leave her palace as
a prisoner of war, and, laying aside all feminine modesty, to wade
through the rivers upon which she borders. Chespı̄ has ĕ instead of ĭ,
and, as in other cases where a sibilant precedes, the mute p instead of
f (compare 'ispı̄, [Jer 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017).md). Both
the prosopopeia and the parallel, "thy shame shall be seen," require
that the expression "thy nakedness shall be uncovered" should not be
understood literally. The shame of Babel is her shameful conduct, which
is not to be exhibited in its true colours, inasmuch as a stronger one
is coming upon it to rob it of its might and honour. This stronger one,
apart from the instrument employed, is Jehovah: vindictam sumam, non
parcam homini. Stier gives a different rendering here, namely, "I will
run upon no man, i.e., so as to make him give way;" Hahn, "I will not
meet with a man," so destitute of population will Babylon be; and
Ruetschi, "I will not step in as a man." Gesenius and Rosenmller are
nearer to the mark when they suggest non pangam (paciscar) cum homine;
but this would require at any rate את־אדם, even if the verb פּגע really
had the meaning to strike a treaty. It means rather to strike against a
person, to assault any one, then to meet or come in an opposite
direction, and that not only in a hostile sense, but, as in this
instance, and also in [Isa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md), in a
friendly sense as well. Hence, "I shall not receive any man, or pardon
any man" (Hitzig, Ewald, etc.). According to an old method of writing
the passage, there is a pause here. But [Isa
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#004.md) is still connected with what goes
before. As Jehovah is speaking in [Isa
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005.md), but Israel in [Isa
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#004.md), and as [Isa
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#004.md) is unsuitable to form the basis
of the words of Jehovah, it must be regarded as the antiphone to [Isa
47:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md) (cf., [Isa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015).md). Our Redeemer, exclaims the
church in joyfully exalted self-consciousness, He is Jehovah of Hosts,
the Holy One of Israel! The one name affirms that He possesses the
all-conquering might; the other that He possesses the will to carry on
the work of redemption - a will influenced and constrained by both love
and wrath.

[Isaiah 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 47:5</span></span>

In the second strophe the penal sentence of Jehovah is continued. "Sit
silent, and creep into the darkness, O Chaldeans-daughter! for men no
longer call thee lady of kingdoms. I was wroth with my people; I
polluted mine inheritance, and gave them into thy hand: thou hast shown
them no mercy; upon old men thou laidst thy yoke very heavily. And thou
saidst, I shall be lady for ever; so that thou didst not take these
things to heart: thou didst not consider the latter end thereof."
Babylon shall sit down in silent, brooding sorrow, and take herself away
into darkness, just as those who have fallen into disgrace shrink from
the eyes of men. She is looked upon as an empress ([Isa
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009.md); the king of Babylon called
himself the king of kings, [Eze 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007).md),
who has been reduced to the condition of a slave, and durst not show
herself for shame. This would happen to her, because at the time when
Jehovah made use of her as His instrument for punishing His people, she
went beyond the bounds of her authority, showing ho pity, and
ill-treating even defenceless old men. According to Loppe, Gesenius, and
Hitzig, Israel is here called zâqēn, as a decayed nation awakening
sympathy; but according to the Scripture, the people of God is always
young, and never decays; on the contrary, its ziqnâh, i.e., the latest
period of its history ([Isa 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004).md), is
to be like its youth. The words are to be understood literally, like
[Lam 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016.md); [Lam
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#012.md) : even upon old men, Babylon had
placed the heavy yoke of prisoners and slaves. But in spite of this
inhumanity, it flattered itself that it would last for ever. Hitzig
adopts the reading עד גּברת, and renders it, "To all future times shall
I continue, mistress to all eternity." This may possibly be correct, but
it is by no means necessary, inasmuch as it can be shown from [Sa1
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#041.md), and [Job
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006.md), that (ד is used as equivalent to
אשׁר עד, in the sense of "till the time that;" and gebhereth, as the
feminine of gâbhēr = gebher, may be the absolute quite as well as the
construct. The meaning therefore is, that the confidence of Babylon in
the eternal continuance of its power was such, that "these things,"
i.e., such punishments as those which were now about to fall upon it
according to the prophecy, had never come into its mind; such, indeed,
that it had not called to remembrance as even possible "the latter end
of it," i.e., the inevitably evil termination of its tyranny and
presumption.

[Isaiah 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 47:8</span></span>

A third strophe of this proclamation of punishment is opened here with
ועתה, on the ground of the conduct censured. "And now hear this, thou
voluptuous one, she who sitteth so securely, who sayeth in her heart, I
am it, and none else: I shall not sit a widow, nor experience
bereavement of children. And these two will come upon thee suddenly in
one day: bereavement of children and widowhood; they come upon thee in
fullest measure, in spite of the multitude of thy sorceries, in spite of
the great abundance of thy witchcrafts. Thou trustedst in thy
wickedness, saidst, No one seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, they
led thee astray; so that thou saidst in thy heart, I am it, and none
else. And misfortune cometh upon thee, which thou dost not understand
how to charm away: and destruction will fall upon thee, which thou canst
not atone for; there will come suddenly upon thee ruin which thou
suspectest not." In the surnames given to Babylon here, a new reason is
assigned for the judgment - namely, extravagance, security, and
self-exaltation. עדין is an intensive from of עדן (lxx τρυφερά). The i
of אפסי is regarded by Hahn as the same as we meet with in אתּי = אתּ;
but this is impossible here with the first person. Rosenmller, Ewald,
Gesenius, and others, take it as chirek compaginis, and equivalent to
עוד אין, which would only occur in this particular formula. Hitzig
supposes it to be the suffix of the word, which is meant as a
preposition in the sense of et praeter me ultra (nemo); but this nemo
would be omitted, which is improbable. The more probable explanation is,
that אפס signifies absolute non-existence, and when used as an adverb,
"exclusively, nothing but," e.g., קצהוּ אפס, nothing, the utmost
extremity thereof, i.e., only the utmost extremity of it ([Num
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013.md); cf., [Num
22:35](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#035).md). But it is mostly used with a
verbal force, like אין (אין), (utique) non est (see [Isa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014).md); hence אפסי, like איני,
(utique) non sum. The form in which the presumption of Babylon expresses
itself, viz., "I (am it), and I am absolutely nothing further," sounds
like self-deification, by the side of similar self-assertion on the part
of Jehovah ([Isa 45:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005.md); [Isa
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#021.md), [Isa
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#022.md) and [Isa
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#009).md). Nineveh speaks in just the same
way in [Zep 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015.md); compare Martial:
"Terrarum Dea gentiumque Roma cui par est nihil et nihil secundum."
Babylon also says still further (like the Babylon of the last days in
[Rev 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007).md): "I shall not sit as a
widow (viz., mourning thus in solitude, [Lam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md); [Lam
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#028.md); and secluded from the world,
[Gen 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#011).md), nor experience the loss
of children" (orbitatem). She would become a widow, if she should lose
the different nations, and "the kings of the earth who committed
fornication with her" ([Rev 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009).md); for
her relation to her own king cannot possibly be thought of, inasmuch as
the relation in which a nation stands to its temporal king is never
thought of as marriage, like that of Jehovah to Israel. She would also
be a mother bereaved of her children, if war and captivity robbed her of
her population. But both of these would happen to her suddenly in one
day, so that she would succumb to the weight of the double sorrow. Both
of them would come upon her kethummâm (secundum integritatem eorum),
i.e., so that she would come to learn what the loss of men and the loss
of children signified in all its extent and in all its depth, and that
in spite of (בּ, with, equivalent to "notwithstanding," as in [Isa
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md); not "through = on account of,"
since this tone is adopted for the first time in [Isa
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#010).md) the multitude of its
incantations, and the very great mass (‛ŏtsmâh, an inf. noun, as in [Isa
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019.md); [Isa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md), used here, not as in [Isa
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#029.md), in an intensive sense, but,
like ‛âtsūm, as a parallel word to rabh in a numerical sense) of its
witchcrafts (chebher, binding by means of incantations, κατάδεσμος).
Babylonia was the birth-place of astrology, from which sprang the
twelve-fold division of the day, the horoscope and sun-dial (Herod. ii.
109); but it was also the home of magic, which pretended to bind the
course of events, and even the power of the gods, and to direct them in
whatever way it pleased (Diodorus, ii. 29). Thus had Babylon trusted in
her wickedness ([Isa 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011).md), viz., in
the tyranny and cunning by which she hoped to ensure perpetual duration,
with the notion that she was exalted above the reach of any earthly
calamity.

She thought, "None seeth me" (non est videns me), thus suppressing the
voice of conscience, and practically denying the omnipotence and
omnipresence of God. ראני (with a verbal suffix, videns me, whereas ראי
saere in [Gen 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#003.md) signifies videns
mei = meus), also written ראני, is a pausal form in half pause for ראני
([Isa 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015).md). Tzere passes in pause
both into pathach (e.g., [Isa 42:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#022).md),
and also, apart from such hithpael forms as [Isa
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#016.md), into kametz, as in קימנוּ ([Job
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#020), which see.md). By the "wisdom and
knowledge" of Babylon, which had turned her aside from the right way, we
are to understand her policy, strategy, and more especially her magical
arts, i.e., the mysteries of the Chaldeans, their ἐπιχώριοι φιλόσοφοι
(Strabo, xxi. 1, 6). On hōvâh (used here and in [Eze
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026), written havvâh elsewhere.md),
according to its primary meaning, "yawning," χαῖνον, then a yawning
depth, χάσμα, utter destruction, see at [Job
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md). שׁאה signifies primarily a
desert, or desolate place, here destruction; and hence the derivative
meaning, waste noise, a dull groan. The perfect consec. of the first
clause precedes its predicate רעה in the radical form בא (Ges., 147, a).
With the parallelism of כּפּרהּ, it is not probable that שׁחרהּ, which
rhymes with it, is a substantive, in the sense of "from which thou wilt
experience no morning dawn" (i.e., after the night of calamity), as
Umbreit supposes. The suffix also causes some difficulty (hence the
Vulgate rendering, ortum ejus, sc. mali); and instead of תדעי, we should
expect תראי. In any case, shachrâh is a verb, and Hitzig renders it,
"which thou wilt not know how to unblacken;" but this privative use of
shichēr as a word of colour would be without example. It would be better
to translate it, "which thou wilt not know how to spy out" (as in [Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009).md), but better still, "which thou
wilt not know how to conjure away" (shichēr = Arab. sḥḥr, as it were
incantitare, and here incantando averruncare). The last relative clause
affirms what shachrâh would state, if understood according to [Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009.md) : destruction which thou wilt not
know, i.e., which will come suddenly and unexpectedly.

[Isaiah 47:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 47:12</span></span>

Then follows the concluding strophe, which, like the first, announces to
the imperial city in a triumphantly sarcastic tone its inevitable fate;
whereas the intermediate strophes refer rather to the sins by which this
fate has been brought upon it. "Come near, then, with thine
enchantments, and with the multitude of thy witchcrafts, wherein thou
hast laboured from thy youth: perhaps thou canst profit, perhaps thou
wilt inspire terror. Thou art wearied through the multitude of thy
consultations; let the dissectors of the heavens come near, then, and
save thee, the star-gazers, they who with every new moon bring things to
light that will come upon thee. Behold, they have become like stubble:
fire has consumed them: there is not a red-hot coal to warm themselves,
a hearth-fire to sit before. So is it with thy people, for whom thou
hast laboured: thy partners in trade from thy youth, they wander away
every one in his own direction; no one who brings salvation to thee."
Hitzig and others adopt the simple rendering, "Persevere, then, with
thine enchantments." It is indeed true, that in [Lev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#005.md) בּ עמד signifies "to remain
standing by anything," i.e., to persevere with it, just as in [Eze
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005.md) it signifies to keep one's
standing in anything; in [Kg2 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003.md), to
enter upon anything; and in [Ecc 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003.md),
to engage in anything; but there is no reason for taking it here in any
other sense than in [Isa 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#013.md).
Babylon is to draw near with all the processes of the black art, wherein
בּאשׁר, according to our western mode of expression, equivalent to בּהם
אשׁר, Ges. 123, 2\*) it had been addicted to abundance of routine from
its youth upwards (יגעאתּ with an auxiliary pathach for יגעתּ); possibly
it may be of some use, possibly it will terrify, i.e., make itself so
terrible to the approaching calamity, as to cause it to keep off. The
prophet now sees in spirit how Babylon draws near, and how it also
harasses itself to no purpose; he therefore follows up the עמדי־נא,
addressed in pleno to Babylon, with a second challenge commencing with
יעמדוּ־נא. Their astrologers are to draw near, and try that power over
the future to which they lay claim, by bringing it to bear at once upon
the approaching destruction for the benefit of Babylon. עצתיך is a
singular form connected with a feminine plural suffix, such as we find
in [Psa 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015.md); [Eze
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#011.md); [Ezr
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#015.md), connected with a masculine
plural suffix. Assuming the correctness of the vowel-pointing, the
singular appears in such cases as these to have a collective meaning,
like the Arabic pl. fractus; for there is no ground to suppose that the
Aramaean plural form ‛ētsâth is used here in the place of the Hebrew.
Instead of שׁמים הברו (which would be equivalent to הברו אשׁרא, the keri
reads שׁמים הברי, cutters up of the heavens, i.e., planners or
dissectors of them, from hâb, dissecare, resecare (compare the
rabbinical habhârâh, a syllable, i.e., segmentum vocabuli, and possibly
also the talmudic 'ēbhârı̄m, limbs of a body). The correction proposed by
Knobel, viz., chōbherē, from châbhār, to know, or be versed in, is
unnecessary. Châzâh b' signifies here, as it generally does, to look
with pleasure or with interest at anything; hence Luther has rendered it
correctly, die Sternkucker (Eng. ver. star-gazers). They are described
still further as those who make known with every new moon (lechŏdâshı̄m,
like labbeqârı̄m, every morning, [Isa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002), etc..md), things which, etc. מאשׁר
is used in a partitive sense: out of the great mass of events they
select the most important, and prepare a calendar or almanack
(ἀλμενιχιακά in Plutarch) for the state every month. But these very wise
men cannot save themselves, to say nothing of others, out of the power
of that flame, which is no comforting coal-fire to warm one's self by,
no hearth-fire ([Isa 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#016).md) to sit in
front of, but a devouring, eternal, i.e., peremptory flame ([Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014).md). The rendering adopted by
Grotius, Vitringa, Lowth, Gesenius, and others, "non supererit pruna ad
calendum," is a false one, if only because it is not in harmony with the
figure. "Thus shall they be unto thee," he continues in [Isa
47:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#015.md), i.e., such things shall be
endured to thy disgrace by those about whom thou hast wearied thyself
(אשׁר = בּהם אשׁר). The learned orders of the Chaldeans had their own
quarter, and enjoyed all the distinction and privileges of a priestly
caste. What follows cannot possibly be understood as relating to these
masters of astrology and witchcraft, as Ewald supposes; for, according
to the expression שׁחרהּ in [Isa
47:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#011.md), they would be called שׁחריך.
Moreover, if they became a prey of the flames, and therefore were unable
to flee, we should have to assume that they were burned while taking
flight (Umbreit). סחריך are those who carried on commercial intercourse
with the great "trading city" ([Eze
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#004).md), as Berossos says, "In Babylon
there was a great multitude of men of other nations who had settled in
Chaldea, and they lived in disorder, like the wild beasts;" compare
Aeschylus, Pers. 52-3, Βαβυλὼν δ ̓ ἡ πολύχρυσος πάμμικτον ὄχλον πέμπει.
All of these are scattered in the wildest flight, אל־עברו אישׁ, every
one on his own side, viz., in the direction of his own home, and do not
trouble themselves about Babylon.
