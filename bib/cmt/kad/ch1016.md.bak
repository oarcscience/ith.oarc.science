### [1 Chronicles Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 16:1</span></span>

The religious festival, and the arrangement of the sacred service before
the ark of the covenant in the city of David. - This section is not
found in 2nd Samuel, where the Conclusion of this whole description
([Ch1 16:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#043), Chron..md) follows
immediately upon the feasting of the people by the king, [Ch1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#019.md) and [Ch1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#020.md).

[1 Chronicles 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 16:4</span></span>

When the solemnity of the transfer of the ark, the sacrificial meal, and
the dismissal of the people with a blessing, and a distribution of food,
were ended, David set in order the service of the Levites in the holy
tent on Zion. He appointed before the ark, from among the Levites,
servants to praise and celebrate God, i.e., singers and players to sing
psalms as a part of the regular worship. להזכּיר, literally, "in order
to bring into remembrance," is not to praise in general, but is to be
interpreted according to the להזכּיר in the superscription of Ps 38 and
[Psa 70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md), by which these psalms are
designated as the appointed prayers at the presentation of the Azcarah
of the meat-offering ([Lev 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002).md).
הזכּיר accordingly is a denom. from אזכּרה, to present the Azcarah (cf.
Del. on [Psa 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001).md), and is in our
verse to be understood of the recital of these prayer-songs with musical
accompaniment. הודות, to confess, refers to the psalms in which
invocation and acknowledgment of the name of the Lord predominates, and
הלּל to those in which praise (Hallelujah) is the prominent feature. In
[Ch1 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005.md) and [Ch1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#006.md) there follow the names of the
Levites appointed for this purpose, who have all been already mentioned
in [Ch1 15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019.md) as accompanying the
ark in its transmission; but all who are there spoken of are not
included in our list here. Of the chief singers only Asaph is mentioned,
Heman and Ethan being omitted; of the singers and players of the second
rank, only nine; six of the eight nebel-players ([Ch1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020.md). יעיאל is a transcriber's error
for יעזיאל, [Ch1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018).md), and only
three of the six kinnor-players; while instead of seven trumpet-blowing
priests only two are named, viz., Benaiah, one of those seven, and
Jehaziel, whose name does not occur in [Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024.md).

[1 Chronicles 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 16:7</span></span>

On that day David first committed it to Asaph and his sons to give
thanks to Jahve. נתן is to be connected with בּיד, which is separated
from it by several words, and denotes to hand over to, here to commit
to, to enjoin upon, since that which David committed to Asaph was the
carrying out of a business which he enjoined, not an object which may be
given into the hand. ההוּא בּיּום is accented by אז. בּראשׁ, "at the
beginning," "at first," to bring out the fact that liturgical singing
was then first introduced. אחיו, the brethren of Asaph, are the Levites
appointed to the same duty, whose names are given in [Ch1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005.md), [Ch1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#006.md). But in order to give a more
exact description of the ליהוה הודות committed to Asaph in vv. 8-36, a
song of thanks and praise is given, which the Levites were to sing as
part of the service with instrumental accompaniment. It is not expressly
said that this song was composed by David for this purpose; but if Asaph
with his singers was to perform the service committed to him, he must
have been provided with the songs of praise (psalms) which were
necessary for this purpose; and if David were in any way the founder of
the liturgical psalmody, he, as a richly endowed psalm-singer, would
doubtless compose the necessary liturgical psalms. These considerations
render it very probable that the following psalm was a hymn composed by
David for the liturgical song in the public worship. The psalm is as
follows: -

8 Give thanks unto Jahve; preach His name;

Make known His deeds among the peoples:

9 Sing to Him, play to Him;

Meditate upon all His wondrous works.

10 Glory ye in His holy name:

Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.

11 Seek ye the Lord, and His strength;

Seek His face continually.

12 Remember His wonders which He has done;

His wondrous works, and the judgments of His mouth;

13 O seed of Israel, His servants,

Sons of Jacob, His chosen.

14 He, Jahve, is our God;

His judgments go forth over all the earth.

15 Remember eternally His covenant,

The word which He commanded to a thousand generations:

16 Which He made with Abraham,

And His oath to Isaac;

17 And caused it to stand to Jacob for a law,

To Israel as an everlasting covenant;

18 Saying, "To thee I give the land Canaan,

As the heritage meted out to you."

19 When ye were still a people to be numbered,

Very few, and strangers therein,

20 And they wandered from nation to nation,

From one kingdom to another people,

21 He suffered no man to oppress them,

And reproved kings for their sake:

22 "Touch not mine anointed ones,

And do my prophets no harm."

23 Sing unto Jahve, all the lands;

Show forth from day to day His salvation.

24 Declare His glory among the heathen,

Among all people His wondrous works.

25 For great is Jahve, and greatly to be praised;

And to be feared is He above all the gods.

26 For all the gods of the people are idols;

And Jahve has made the heavens.

27 Majesty and splendour is before Him;

Strength and joy are in His place.

28 Give unto Jahve, ye kindreds of the people,

Give unto Jahve glory and strength.

29 Give unto Jahve the honour of His name:

Bring an offering, and come before His presence;

Worship the Lord in the holy ornaments.

30 Tremble before Him, all the lands;

Then will the earth stand fast unshaking.

31 Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice;

And they will say among the heathen, Jahve is King.

32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;

Let the field exult, and all that is thereon.

33 Then shall the trees of the wood rejoice

Before the Lord; for He comes to judge the earth.

34 Give thanks unto Jahve, for He is good;

For His mercy endureth for ever.

35 And say, "Save us, God of our salvation:"

And gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen,

To give thanks to Thy holy name,

To glory in Thy praise.

36 Blessed be Jahve, the God of Israel,

From everlasting to everlasting.

And all the people said Amen, and praised Jahve.

[1 Chronicles 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 16:8</span></span>

This hymn forms a connected and uniform whole. Beginning with a summons
to praise the Lord, and to seek His face ([Ch1
16:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#008).md), the singer exhorts his
people to remember the wondrous works of the Lord ([Ch1
16:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#012).md), and the covenant which He
made with the patriarchs to give them the land of Canaan ([Ch1
16:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#015).md), and confirms his
exhortation by pointing out how the Lord, in fulfilment of His promise,
had mightily and gloriously defended the patriarchs ([Ch1
16:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#019).md). But all the world also are
to praise Him as the only true and almighty God ([Ch1
16:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#023).md), and all peoples do homage
to Him with sacrificial gifts ([Ch1
16:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#028).md); and that His kingdom may be
acknowledged among the heathen, even inanimate nature will rejoice at
His coming to judgment ([Ch1
16:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#031).md). In conclusion, we have
again the summons to thankfulness,combined with a prayer that God would
further vouchsafe salvation; and a doxology rounds off the whole ([Ch1
16:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034).md). When we consider the
contents of the whole hymn, it is manifest that it contains nothing
which would be at all inconsistent with the belief that it was composed
by David for the above-mentioned religious service. There is nowhere any
reference to the condition of the people in exile, nor yet to the
circumstances after the exile. The subject of the praise to which Israel
is summoned is the covenant which God made with Abraham, and the
wonderful way in which the patriarchs were led. The summons to the
heathen to acknowledge Jahve as alone God and King of the world, and to
come before His presence with sacrificial offerings, together with the
thought that Jahve will come to judge the earth, belong to the Messianic
hopes. These had formed themselves upon the foundation of the promises
given to the patriarchs, and the view they had of Jahve as Judge of the
heathen, when He led His people out of Egypt,so early, that even in the
song of Moses at the Red Sea (Ex. 15), and the song of the pious Hannah
([Sa1 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001).md), we meet with the first
germs of them; and what we find in David and the prophets after him are
only further development of these.

Yet all the later commentators, with the exception of Hitzig, die
Psalmen, ii. S. ix.f., judge otherwise as to the origin of this festal
hymn. Because the first half of it ([Ch1
16:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#008).md) recurs in [Psa
105:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md), the second ([Ch1
16:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#023).md) in [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md), and the conclusion ([Ch1
16:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034).md) in Ps.[Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md), [Psa
106:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047.md), it is concluded that the
author of the Chronicle compounded the hymn from these three psalms, in
order to reproduce the festive songs which were heard after the ark had
been brought in, in the same free way in which the speeches in
Thucydides and Livy reproduce what was spoken at various times. Besides
the later commentators, Aug. Koehler (in the Luth. Ztschr. 1867, S.
289ff.) and C. Ehrt (Abfassungszeit und Abschluss des Psalters, Leipz.
1869, S. 41ff.) are of the same opinion. The possibility that our hymn
may have arisen in this way cannot be denied; for such a supposition
would be in so far consistent with the character of the Chronicle, as we
find in it speeches which have not been reported verbatim by the
hearers, but are given in substance or in freer outline by the author of
our Chronicle, or, as is more probable, by the author of the original
documents made use of by the chronicler. But this view can only be shown
to be correct if it corresponds to the relation in which our hymn may be
ascertained to stand to the three psalms just mentioned. Besides the
face that its different sections are again met with scattered about in
different psalms, the grounds for supposing that our hymn is not an
original poem are mainly the want of connection in the transition from
[Ch1 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#022.md) to v.23, and from [Ch1
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#033.md) to v.34; the fact that in v.35
we have a verse referring to the Babylonian exile borrowed from Ps 106;
and that [Ch1 16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036.md) is even the
doxology of the fourth book of Psalms, taken to be a component part of
the psalm. These two latter grounds would be decisive, if the facts on
which they rest were well authenticated. If. [Ch1
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036.md) really contained only the
doxology of the fourth book of Psalms-which, like the doxologies of the
first, second, and third books (Ps. 41:14; [Psa
72:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018), and 89:53.md), was merely
formally connected with the psalm, without being a component part of
it-there could be no doubt that the author of the Chronicle had taken
the conclusion of his hymn from our collection of psalms, as these
doxologies only date from the originators of our collection. But this is
not the state of the case. [Psa 106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048.md)
does, it is true, occupy in our Psalter the place of the doxology to the
fourth book, but belonged, as Bertheau also acknowledges, originally to
the psalm itself. For not only is it different in form from the
doxologies of the first three books, not having the double ואמן אמן with
which these books close, but it concludes with the simple הללוּ־יהּ אמן.
If the ואמן אמן connected by ו is, in the Old Testament language,
exclusively confined to these doxologies, which thus approach the
language of the liturgical Beracha of the second temple, as Del. Ps. p.
15 rightly remarks, while in [Num 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#022.md)
and [Neh 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#006.md) only אמן אמן without
copulative w occurs, it is just this peculiarity of the liturgical
Beracha which is wanting, both in the concluding verse of the 106th
Psalm and in [Ch1 16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036.md) of our festal
hymn. Moreover, the remainder of the verse in question - the last clause
of it, "And let all the people say Amen, Halleluiah," - does not suit
the hypothesis that the verse is the doxology appended to the conclusion
of the fourth book by the collector of the Psalms, since, as
Hengstenberg in his commentary on the psalm rightly remarks, "it is
inconceivable that the people should join in that which, as mere closing
doxology of a book, would have no religious character;" and "the praise
in the conclusion of the psalm beautifully coincides with its
commencement, and the Halleluiah of the end is shown to be an original
part of the psalm by its correspondence with the beginning."

(Note: Bertheau also rightly says: "If in Ps 72 (as also in Ps 89 and
91) the author of the doxology himself says Amen, while in [Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048.md) the saying of the Amen is
committed to the people, this difference can only arise from the face
that Ps 106 originally concluded with the exhortation to say Amen."
Hitzig speaks with still more decision, die Pss. (1865), ii. S. x.: "If
(in Ps 106) [Psa 106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047.md) is the
conclusion, a proper ending is wanting; while [Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048.md), on the contrary, places the
psalm on a level with Ps 103-105; 107. Who can believe that the author
himself, for the purpose of ending the fourth book with [Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048.md), caused the psalm to extend to
the [Psa 106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048.md)? In the Chronicle, the
people whom the verse mentions are present from 1 Chron 15:3-16:2, while
in the psalm no one can see how they should come in there. Whether the
verse belong to the psalm or not, the turning to all the people, and the
causing the people to say Amen, Amen, instead of the writer, has no
parallel in the Psalms, and is explicable only on the supposition that
it comes from the Chronicle. Afterwards a Diaskeuast might be satisfied
to take the verse as the boundary-stone of a book.")

The last verse of our hymn does not therefore presuppose the existence
of the collection of psalms, nor in [Ch1
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#035.md) is there any indubitable
reference to the exilic time. The words, "Say, 'Save us, Thou God of our
salvation; gather us together, and deliver us from among the heathen,' "
do not presuppose that the people had been previously led away into the
Chaldean exile, but only the dispersion of prisoners of war, led away
captive into an enemy's land after a defeat. This usually occurred after
each defeat of Israel by their enemies, and it was just such cases
Solomon had in view in his prayer, [Kg1
8:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046.md).

The decision as to the origin of this festal hymn, therefore, depends
upon its internal characteristics, and the result of a comparison of the
respective texts. The song in itself forms, as Hitz. l.c. S. 19 rightly
judges, "a thoroughly coherent and organic whole. The worshippers of
Jahve are to sing His praise in memory of His covenant which He made
with their fathers, and because of which He protected them ([Ch1
16:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#018).md). But all the world also are
to praise Him, the only true God ([Ch1
16:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#023).md); the peoples are to come
before Him with gifts; yea, even inanimate nature is to pay the King and
Judge its homage ([Ch1 16:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#028).md).
Israel - and with this the end returns to the beginning-is to thank
Jahve, and invoke His help against the heathen ([Ch1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034.md) and [Ch1
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#035).md)." This exposition of the
symmetrical disposition of the psalm is not rendered questionable by the
objections raised by Koehler, l.c.; nor can the recurrence of the
individual parts of it in three different psalms of itself at all prove
that in the Chronicle we have not the original form of the hymn. "There
is nothing to hinder us from supposing that the author of [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md) may be the same as the author
of Ps 105 and 106; but even another might be induced by example to
appropriate the first half of [Ch1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#008.md)., as his predecessor had
appropriated the second, and it would naturally occur to him to supply
from his own resources the continuation which had been already taken
away and made use of" (Hitz. l.c.). A similar phenomenon is the
recurrence of the second half of [Psa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md). as an independent psalm, [Psa
70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md). "But it is also readily
seen,"continues Hitzig, "how easily the psalmist might separate the last
three verses from each other ([Ch1
16:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034) of the Chronicle.md), and set
them as a frame round Ps 106. [Ch1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034.md) is not less suitable in the
Chronicle for the commencement of a paragraph than in Ps 107, which [Psa
107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006.md) would admit of no continuation,
but was the proper end. On the other hand, we can scarcely believe that
the chronicler compiled his song first from Ps 105, then from [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md), and lastly from Ps 106,
striking off from this latter only the beginning and the end."

Finally, if we compare the text of our hymn with the text of these
psalms, the divergences are of such a sort that we cannot decide with
certainty which of the two texts is the original. To pass over such
critically indifferent variations as פּיהוּ, [Ch1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#012.md), for פּיו, [Psa
105:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#005.md); the omission of the nota acc.
את, [Ch1 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#018.md), compared with [Psa
105:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#010.md), and vice versa in [Psa
96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md) and [Ch1
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#024.md); היּער עצי, [Ch1
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#033.md), instead of היּער כּל־עצי, [Psa
96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md), - the chronicler has in יצחק,
[Ch1 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#016.md), instead of ישׂחק, [Psa
105:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#009.md), and יעלץ, [Ch1
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#032.md), instead of יעלז, [Psa
96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md), the earlier and more primitive
form; in תּרעוּ אל בּנביאי, [Ch1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#022.md), instead of תּרעוּ אל לנביאי,
[Psa 105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015.md), a quite unusual
construction; and in יום אל מיּום, [Ch1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#023.md), the older form (cf. [Num
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#015).md), instead of ליום מיּום, [Psa
96:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#002.md), as in [Est
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007.md); while, on the other hand, instead
of the unexampled phrase לעשׁקם אדם הנּיח, [Psa
105:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014.md), there stands in the Chronicle
the usual phrase לאישׁ הנּיח, and שׂדי dna , in [Psa
96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md) is the poetical form for the
השּׂדה of [Ch1 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#032.md). More important
are the wider divergences: not so much ישׂראל זרע, [Ch1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#013.md), for אברהם זרע, [Psa
105:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006.md), in which latter case it is
doubtful whether the עבדּו refers to the patriarchs or to the people,
and consequently, as the parallelismus membrorum demands the latter
references, ישׂראל is clearly the more correct and intelligible; but
rather than the others, viz., זכרוּ, [Ch1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#015.md), for זכר, [Psa
105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008.md); since זכרוּ not only
corresponds to the זכרוּ of [Ch1
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#011.md), but alto to the use made of the
song for the purposes stated in the Chronicle; while, on the contrary,
זכר of the psalm corresponds to the object of the psalm, viz., to exalt
the covenant grace shown to the patriarchs. Connected with this also is
the reading בּהיותכם, "when ye (sons of Jacob) were" ([Ch1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#019).md), instead of בּהיותם, [Psa
105:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012), "when they (the patriarchs.md)
were," since the narrative of what the Lord had done demanded בהיותם.
Now the more likely the reference of the words to the patriarchs was to
suggest itself, the more unlikely is the hypothesis of an alteration
into בהיותכם; and the text of the Chronicle being the more difficult, is
consequently to be regarded as the earlier. Moreover, the divergences of
[Ch1 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#023.md) to 33 of our hymn from [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md) are such as would result from
its having been prepared for the above-mentioned solemn festival. The
omission of the two strophes, "Sing unto Jahve a new song, sing unto
Jahve, bless His name" ([Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md) and
[Psa 96:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#002).md), in [Ch1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#023.md) of the Chronicle might be
accounted for by regarding that part of our hymn as an abridgment by the
chronicler of the original song, when connecting it with the preceding
praise of God, were it certain on other grounds that [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md) was the original; but if the
chronicler's hymn be the original, we may just as well believe that this
section was amplified when it was made into an independent psalm. A
comparison of [Ch1 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#033) (Chron..md) with
the end of the 96th Psalm favours this last hypothesis, for in the
Chronicle the repetition of בּא כּי is wanting, as well as the second
hemistich of [Psa 96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md). The whole of
the 13th verse recurs, with a single בּא כּי, at the end of the 98th
Psalm ([Psa 98:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#009).md), and the thought is
borrowed from the Davidic [Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md).
The strophes in the beginning of [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md), which are omitted from [Ch1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#016.md), often recur. The phrase, "Sing
unto Jahve a new song," is met within [Psa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003.md); [Psa
98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md), and [Psa
149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md), and חדשׁ שׁיר in [Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004.md), a Davidic psalm. את־שׁמו בּרכוּ
is also met with in [Psa 100:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#004.md); and
still more frequently את־יהוה בּרכוּ, in [Psa
103:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#002.md), [Psa
103:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#022.md); [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md), and elsewhere, even as early as
Deborah's song, [Jdg 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#002.md), [Jdg
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#009.md); while ליהוה שׁירוּ occurs in the
song of Moses, [Exo 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md). Since, then,
the strophes of the 96th Psalm are only reminiscences of, and phrases
which we find in, the oldest religious songs of the Israelites, it is
clear that [Psa 96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md) is not an
original poem. It is rather the re-grouping of the well-known and
current thoughts; and the fact that it is so, favours the belief that
all which this psalm contains at the beginning and end, which the
Chronicle does not contain, is merely an addition made by the poet who
transformed this part of the chronicler's hymn into an independent psalm
for liturgical purposes. This purpose clearly appears in such variations
as בּמקדּשׁו ותפארת, [Psa 96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006.md),
instead of בּמקמו וחדוה, [Ch1 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#027.md),
and לחצרותיו וּבאוּ, [Psa 96:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008.md),
instead of לפניו וּבאוּ, [Ch1 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#029.md).
Neither the word מקדּשׁ nor the mention of "courts" is suitable in a
hymn sung at the consecration of the holy tent in Zion, for at that time
the old national sanctuary with the altar in the court (the tabernacle)
still stood in Gibeon.

Here, therefore, the text of the Chronicle corresponds to the
circumstances of David's time, while the mention of מקדּשׁ and of courts
in the psalm presupposes the existence of the temple with its courts as
the sanctuary of the people of Israel. Now a post-exilic poet would
scarcely have paid so much attention to this delicate distinction
between times and circumstances as to alter, in the already existing
psalms, out of which he compounded this festal hymn, the expressions
which were not suitable to the Davidic time. Against this, the use of
the unusual word חדוה drow lau, joy, which occurs elsewhere only in [Neh
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#008.md), [Neh
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#010.md), and in Chaldee in [Ezr
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#018.md), is no valid objection, for the
use of the verb חדה as early as [Exo
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#009.md) and [Job
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#006.md) shows that the word does not
belong to the later Hebrew. The discrepancy also between [Ch1
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#030.md) and [Ch1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#031.md) and [Psa
96:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009.md), namely, the omission in the
Chronicle of the strophe בּמישׁרים עמּים ידין ([Psa
96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010).md), and the placing of the clause
מלך יהוה בגּוים \_ ויאמרוּ after הארץ ותגל ([Ch1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#031.md), cf. [Psa
96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010).md), does not really prove anything
as to the priority of [Psa 96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md).
Hitzig, indeed, thinks that since by the omission of the one member the
parallelism of the verses is disturbed, and a triple verse appears where
all the others are double merely, and because by this alteration the
clause,"Say among the people, Jahve is King," has come into an
apparently unsuitable position, between an exhortation to the heaven and
earth to rejoice, and the roaring of the sea and its fulness, this
clause must have been unsuitably placed by a copyist's error. But the
transposition cannot be so explained; for not only is that one member of
the verse misplaced, but also the אמרוּ of the psalm is altered into
ויאמרוּ, and moreover, we get no explanation of the omission of the
strophe וגו ידין. If we consider ויאמרוּ (with ו consecutive), "then
will they say," we see clearly that it corresponds to וגו ירנּנוּ אז in
[Ch1 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#033.md); and in [Ch1
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#030.md) the recognition of Jahve's
kingship over the peoples is represented as the issue and effect of the
joyful exultation of the heaven and earth, just as in [Ch1
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#032.md) and [Ch1
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#033.md) the joyful shouting of the trees
of the field before Jahve as He comes to judge the earth, is regarded as
the result of the roaring of the sea and the gladness of the fields. The
אמרוּ of the psalm, on the other hand, the summons to the Israelites to
proclaim that Jahve is King among the peoples, is, after the call, "Let
the whole earth tremble before Him," a somewhat tame expression; and
after it, again, we should not expect the much stronger וגו תּכּון אף.
When we further consider that the clause which follows in the Chronicle,
"He will judge the people in uprightness," is a reminiscence of [Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md), we must hold the text of the
Chronicle to be here also the original, and the divergences in [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md) for alterations, which were
occasioned by the changing of a part of our hymn into an independent
psalm. Finally, there can be no doubt as to the priority of the
chronicler's hymn in [Ch1 16:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034.md).
The author of the Chronicle did not require to borrow the liturgical
formula וגו טוב כּי ליהוה הודוּ from [Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md), for it occurs in as complete a
form in [Psa 97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001.md); [Psa
118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md), [Psa
118:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#029.md); [Psa
136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md), and, not to mention [Ch2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013.md); [Ch2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#003.md); [Ch2
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021.md), is a current phrase with
Jeremiah ([Jer 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011).md), and is without
doubt an ancient liturgical form. [Ch1
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#035.md) and [Ch1
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036.md), too, contain such divergences
from [Psa 106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047.md) and [Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048.md), that it is in the highest
degree improbable that they were borrowed from that psalm. Not only is
the prayer וגו הושׁיענוּ introduced by אמרוּ, but also, instead of
אלהינוּ יהוה of the psalm, we have ישׁענוּ אלהי; and to וקבּצנוּ,
והצּילנוּ is added, - a change which causes the words to lose the
reference to the Chaldean exile contained in the text of the Psalms. The
post-exilic author of the Chronicle would scarcely have obliterated this
reference, and certainly would not have done so in such a delicate
fashion, had he taken the verse from Ps 106. A much more probable
supposition is, that the post-exilic author of the 106th Psalm
appropriated the concluding verse of David's to him well-known hymn, and
modified it to make it fit into his poem. Indubitable instances of such
alterations are to be found in the conclusion, where the statement of
the chronicler, that all the people said Amen and praised Jahve, is made
to conform to the psalm, beginning as it does with Halleluiah, by
altering ויּאמרוּ into ואמר, "and let them say," and of ליהוה והלּל into
הללוּ־יהּ.

On the whole, therefore, we must regard the opinion that David composed
our psalm for the above-mentioned festival as by far the most probable.
The psalm itself needs no further commentary; but compare Delitzsch on
the parallel psalms and parts of psalms.

[1 Chronicles 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">ch1 16:37</span></span>

Division of the Levites for the management of the public worship. - At
the same time as he set up the ark in the tent erected for it on Mount
Zion, David had prepared a new locality for the public worship. The
Mosaic tabernacle had continued, with its altar of burnt-offering, to be
the general place of worship for the congregation of Israel even during
the long period when the ark was separated from it, and it was even yet
to be so; and it became necessary, in order to carry on the religious
service in both of these sanctuaries, to divide the staff of religious
officials: and this David now undertook.

[Ch1 16:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037.md)

Before the ark he left Asaph with his brethren (ל( nerht before the
accus. obj., according to the later usage), to serve, to minister there
continually. בּיומו לדבר־יום, "according to the matter of the day on its
day," i.e., according to the service necessary for each day; cf. for
this expression, [Exo 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#013.md), [Exo
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#019.md); [Exo
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#004.md), etc. "And Obed-edom and their
brethren." In these words there is a textual error: the plural suffix in
אחיהם shows that after אדום עבד at least one name has been dropped out.
But besides that, the relation in which the words, "and Obed-edom the
son of Jeduthun, and Hosah, to be porters," stand to the preceding
clause, "and Obed-edom and their brethren," is obscure. Against the
somewhat general idea, that the words are to be taken in an explicative
sense, "and Obed-edom indeed," etc., the objection suggests itself, that
Obed-edom is here defined to be the son of Jeduthun, and would seem to
be thereby distinguished from the preceding Obed-edom. In addition to
that, in [Ch1 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021.md) and Obed-edom is
mentioned among the singers, and in [Ch1
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#024.md) one of the doorkeepers bears
that name, and they are clearly distinguished as being different
persons. On the other hand, however, the identity of the two Obed-edoms
in our verse is supported by the fact that in [Ch1
26:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#004.md) the doorkeepers Obed-edom with
his sons and brethren number sixty-two, which comes pretty nearly up to
the number mentioned in our verse, viz., sixty-eight. Yet we cannot
regard this circumstance as sufficient to identify the two, and must
leave the question undecided, because the text of our verse is
defective. Jeduthun the father of Obed-edom is different from the chief
musician Jeduthun (= Ethan); for the chief musician is a descendant of
Merari, while the doorkeeper Jeduthun belongs to the Korahites (i.e.,
Kohathites): see on [Ch1 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#004.md).

[Ch1 16:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039.md)

צדוק ואת is still dependent on the ויּעזב in [Ch1
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037.md). The priest Zadok with his
brethren he left before the tent of Jahve, i.e., the tabernacle at the
Bamah in Gibeon. For בּמה see on [Ch2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013.md), and for Zadok on [Ch2
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#012.md). It is surprising here that no
priest is named as superintendent or overseer of the sacrificial worship
in the tent of the ark of the covenant. But the omission is accounted
for by the fact that our chapter treats properly only of the arrangement
of the sacred music connected with the worship, and Zadok is mentioned
as overseer of the sanctuary of the tabernacle at Gibeon only in order
to introduce the statement as to the Levitic singers and players
assigned to that sanctuary. Without doubt Abiathar as high priest had
the oversight of the sacrificial worship in the sanctuary of the
tabernacle: see on [Ch1 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#016.md); with
[Ch1 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#040.md) cf. [Exo
29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md); [Num
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003.md), [Num
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#006.md). לכל־הכּתוּב corresponds to
להעלות: and in reference to all, i.e., to look after all, which was
written. This refers not only to the bringing of the sacrifices
prescribed, in addition to the daily burnt-offering, but in general to
everything that it was the priests' duty to do in the sanctuary.

[Ch1 16:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041.md)

ועמּהם, and with them (with Zadok and his brethren) were Heman and
Jeduthun, i.e., (the two other chief musicians, [Ch1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019).md), with the other chosen famous,
sc. singers (בשׁמות נקּבוּ, see on [Ch1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#031).md). To these belonged those of the
number named in [Ch1 15:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018.md), [Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024.md), who are not mentioned among
those assigned to Asaph in [Ch1 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005.md)
and [Ch1 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#006.md), and probably also a
number of others whose names have not been handed down. In [Ch1
16:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#042.md), if the text be correct,
וידוּתוּן הימן can only be in apposition to עמּהם: "and with them, viz.,
with Heman and Jeduthun, were trumpets," etc. But, not to mention the
difficulty that passages analogous and parallel to this statement are
not to be found, the mention of these two chief musicians in the
connection is surprising; for the musical instruments mentioned are not
merely the מצלתּים (s. [Ch1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019).md)
played by them, but also the חצצרות which the priests blew, and other
instruments. Moreover, the names Heman and Jeduthun are not found here
in the lxx, and have probably been inserted in our verse by some copyist
from [Ch1 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041.md), which likewise begins
with ועמּהם. If we omit these names, then, the verse contains no other
difficulty worthy of consideration, or any which would occasion or
necessitate such violent alterations of the text as Berth. has proposed.
The suffix in עמּהם refers to the persons mentioned in [Ch1
16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041.md), Heman, Jeduthun, and the other
chosen ones. "With them were," i.e., they had by them, trumpets,
cymbals, etc. The ל before משׁמיעים is strange, since משׁמיעים is in
[Ch1 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016.md) connected with מצלתּים as
an adjective, and in [Ch1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019.md) we
have להשׁמיע. But if we compare [Ch1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005.md) of our chapter, where משׁמיע is
predicate to Asaph, "Asaph gave forth clear notes with cymbals," then
here also למשׁמיעים in connection with מצלתּים is thoroughly justified
in the signification, "and cymbals for those who gave forth the notes or
the melody," i.e., for Heman and Jeduthun. הא שׁיר כּלי are the other
instruments used in the service of the song, viz., the nablia and
kinnoroth. "The sons of Jeduthun for the gate," i.e., as doorkeepers. As
Obed-edom, who was doorkeeper by the ark, according to [Ch1
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038.md), was likewise a son of Jeduthun,
here other sons of the same Jeduthun, brothers of Obed-edom, must be
meant, the number of whom, if we may judge from [Ch1
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#008.md), was very considerable; so that
the members of this family were able to attend to the doorkeeping both
by the ark and in the tabernacle at Gibeon.

[Ch1 16:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#043.md)

[Ch1 16:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#043.md) brings the account of the
transfer of the ark to a conclusion, and coincides in substance with
[Sa2 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019.md) and [Sa2
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020.md), where, however, there follows in
addition a narrative of the scene which David had with his wife Michal.
This, as res domestica, the author of the Chronicle has omitted, since
the reference to it in [Ch1 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#029.md)
seemed sufficient for the design of his work. לברך is not to greet, but
to bless his house, just as in [Ch1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#002.md) he had already pronounced a
blessing on his people in the name of God.
