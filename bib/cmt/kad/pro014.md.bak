### [Proverbs Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 14:1</span></span>

1 The wisdom of the woman buildeth her house,

And folly teareth it down with its own hands.

Were it חכמות נשׁים, after [Jdg 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#029.md),
cf. [Isa 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md), then the meaning would
be: the wise among women, each of them buildeth her house. But why then
not just אשּׁה חכמה, as [Sa2 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002.md), cf.
[Exo 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#025.md)? The Syr., Targum, and
Jerome write sapiens mulier. And if the whole class must be spoken of,
why again immediately the individualizing in בּנתה? The lxx obliterates
that by its ᾠκοδόμησαν. And does not אוּלת \[folly\] in the contrasted
proverb (1b) lead us to conclude on a similar abstract in 1a? The
translators conceal this, for they translate אולת personally. Thus also
the Venet. and Luther; אוּלת is, says Kimchi, an adj. like עוּרת, caeca.
But the linguistic usage does not point אויל with אוילי to any אוּל. It
is true that a fem. of אויל does not occur; there is, however, also no
place in which אולת may certainly present itself as such. Thus also
חכמות must be an abstr.; we have shown at [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md) how חכמות, as neut. plur., might
have an abstr. meaning. But since it is not to be perceived why the poet
should express himself so singularly, the punctuation חכמות is to be
understood as proceeding from a false supposition, and is to be read
חכמות, as at [Pro 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md) (especially
since this passage rests on the one before us). Fleischer says: "to
build the house is figuratively equivalent to, to regulate well the
affairs of a house, and to keep them in a good condition; the contrary,
to tear down the house, is the same contrast as the Arab. 'amârat âlbyt
and kharab albyt. Thus e.g., in Burckhardt's Sprchw. 217, harrt ṣabrt
bythâ 'amârat, a good woman (ein braves Weib) has patience (with her
husband), and thereby she builds up her house (at the same time an
example of the use of the preterite in like general sentences for
individualizing); also No. 430 of the same work: 'amârat âlbyt wla
kharâbt, it is becoming to build the house, not to destroy it; cf. in
the Thousand and One Nights, where a woman who had compelled her husband
to separate from her says: âna âlty 'amalt hadhâ barwḥy wâkhrnt byty
bnfsy. Burckhardt there makes the remark: 'amârat âlbyt denotes the
family placed in good circumstances - father, mother, and children all
living together happily and peacefully." This conditional relation of
the wife to the house expresses itself in her being named as house-wife
(cf. Hausehre \[= honour of a house\] used by Luther, [Psa
68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013).md), to which the Talmudic דּביתי
(= uxor mea) answers; the wife is noted for this, and hence is called
עיקר הבית, the root and foundation of the house; vid., Buxtorf's Lex.
col. 301. In truth, the oneness of the house is more dependent on the
mother than on the father. A wise mother can, if her husband be dead or
neglectful of his duty, always keep the house together; but if the
house-wife has neither understanding nor good-will for her calling, then
the best will of the house-father cannot hinder the dissolution of the
house, prudence and patience only conceal and mitigate the process of
dissolution - folly, viz., of the house-wife, always becomes more and
more, according to the degree in which this is a caricature of her
calling, the ruin of the house.

[Proverbs 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 14:2</span></span>

2 He walketh in his uprightness who feareth Jahve,

And perverse in his ways is he that despiseth Him.

That which syntactically lies nearest is also that which is intended;
the ideas standing in the first place are the predicates. Wherein it
shows itself, and whereby it is recognised, that a man fears God, or
stands in a relation to Him of indifference instead of one of fear and
reverence, shall be declared: the former walketh in his uprightness,
i.e., so far as the consciousness of duty which animates him prescribes;
the latter in his conduct follows no higher rule than his own lust,
which drives him sometimes hither and sometimes thither. הולך בּישׁרו
.rehtih (cf. ישׁר הולך, [Mic 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007).md) is
of kindred meaning with הולך בּתמּו, [Pro
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#006.md) (הולך בּתּום, [Pro
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009).md), and הולך נכחו, [Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md). The connection of נלוז דּרכיו
follows the scheme of [Kg2 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#037.md), and
not [Sa2 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032.md), Ewald, 288c. If the
second word, which particularizes the idea of the first, has the
reflexive suff. as here, then the accusative connection, or, as [Pro
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015.md), the prepositional, is more usual
than the genitive. Regarding לוּז, flectere, inclinare (a word common to
the author of chap. 1-9), vid., at [Pro
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015.md). With בּוזהוּ, cf. [Sa1
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#030.md); the suffix without doubt refers
to God, for בוזהו is the word that stands in parallel contrast to 'ירא
ה.

[Proverbs 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 14:3</span></span>

3 In the mouth of the fool is a switch of pride;

But the lips of the wise preserve them.

The noun חטר (Aram. חוּטרא, Arab. khiṭr), which besides here occurs only
at [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), meaning properly a
brandishing (from חטר = Arab. khatr, to brandish, to move up and down or
hither and thither, whence âlkhṭtâr, the brandisher, poet. the spear),
concretely, the young elastic twig, the switch, i.e., the slender
flexible shoot. Luther translates, "fools speak tyrannically," which is
the briefer rendering of his earlier translation, "in the mouth of the
fool is the sceptre of pride;" but although the Targum uses חוטרא of the
king's sceptre and also of the prince's staff, yet here for this the
usual Hebr. שׁבט were to be expected. In view of [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), the nearest idea is, that pride
which has its roots in the heart of the fool, grows up to his mouth. But
yet it is not thus explained why the representation of this proceeding
from within stops with חטר cf. [Pro
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030).md). The βακτηρία ὕβρεως (lxx, and
similarly the other Greek versions) is either meant as the rod of
correction of his own pride (as e.g., Abulwald, and, among the moderns,
Bertheau and Zckler) or as chastisement for others (Syr., Targum: the
staff of reviling). Hitzig is in favour of the former idea, and thinks
himself warranted in translating: a rod for his back; but while גּוה is
found for גּאוה, we do not (cf. under [Job
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#007) : a pride are the, etc..md) find
גאוה for גוה, the body, or גּו, the back. But in general it is to be
assumed, that if the poet had meant חטר as the means of correction, he
would have written גּאותו. Rightly Fleischer: "The tongue is often
compared to a staff, a sword, etc., in so far as their effects are
ascribed to it; we have here the figure which in [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md) passes over into plastic
reality." Self-exaltation (R. גא, to strive to be above) to the delusion
of greatness is characteristic of the fool, the אויל \[godless\], not
the כּסיל \[stupid, dull\] - Hitzig altogether confounds these two
conceptions. With such self-exaltation, in which the mind, morally if
not pathologically diseased, says, like Nineveh and Babylon in the
prophets, I am alone, and there is no one with me, there is always
united the scourge of pride and of disgrace; and the meaning of 3b may
now be that the lips of the wise protect those who are exposed to this
injury (Ewald), or that they protect the wise themselves against such
assaults (thus most interpreters). But this reference of the eos to
others lies much more remote than at [Pro
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#006.md); and that the protection of the
wise against injury inflicted on them by words is due to their own lips
is unsatisfactory, as in this case, instead of Bewahrung \[custodia\],
we would rather expect Vertheidigung \[defensio\], Dmpfung \[damping,
extinguishing\], Niederduckung \[stooping down, accommodating oneself to
circumstances\]. But also it cannot be meant that the lips of the wise
preserve them from the pride of fools, for the thought that the mouth
preserves the wise from the sins of the mouth is without meaning and
truth (cf. the contrary, [Pro 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#003).md).
Therefore Arama interprets the verb as jussive: the lips = words of the
wise mayest thou keep i.e., take to heart. And the Venet. translates:
χείλη δὲ σοφῶν φυλάξεις αὐτά, which perhaps means: the lips of the wise
mayest thou consider, and that not as a prayer, which is foreign to the
gnome, but as an address to the hearer, which e.g., [Pro
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#019.md) shows to be admissible. but
although in a certain degree of similar contents, yet 3a and 3b clash.
Therefore it appears to us more probable that the subject of 3b is the
חכמה contained in חכמים; in [Pro 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#022.md)
wisdom is also the subject to תשׁמר עליך without its being named. Thus:
while hurtful pride grows up to the throat of the fool, that, viz.,
wisdom, keeps the lips of the wise, so that no word of self-reflection,
especially none that can wound a neighbour, escapes from them. The form
תּשׁמוּרם is much more peculiar than ישׁפּוּטוּ, [Exo
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#026.md), and תעבוּרי, [Rut
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#008.md), for the latter are obscured forms
of ישׁפּטוּ and תעברי, while on the contrary the former arises from
תּשׁמרם.

(Note: Vid., regarding these forms with ǒ instead of the simple Sheva,
Kimchi, Michlol 20ab. He also remarks that these three forms with û are
all Milra; this is the case also in a remarkable manner with ישׁפּוּטוּ,
vid., Michlol 21b; Livjath Chen ii. 9; and particularly Heidenheim, in
his edition of the Pentateuch entitled Mer Enajim, under [Exo
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#026)..md)

If, according to the usual interpretation, we make שׂפתי the subject,
then the construction follows the rule, Gesen. 146, 2. The lxx transfers
it into Greek: χείλη δὲ σοφῶν φυλάσσει αὐτούς. The probable conjecture,
that תשׁמורם is an error in transcription for תּשׁמרוּם = תּשׁמרנה אתם
(this is found also in Luzzatto's Gramm. 776; and Hitzig adduces as
other examples of such transpositions of the ו [Jer
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025.md); [Jer
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#023.md); [Job
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#012.md), and [Jos
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#004), ותצפנו for ותצפון.md), we do not
acknowledge, because it makes the lips the subject with an exclusiveness
the justification of which is doubtful to us.

[Proverbs 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 14:4</span></span>

The switch and the preserving, [Pro
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#003.md), may have given occasion to the
collector, amid the store of proverbs before him, now to present the
agricultural figure:

Without oxen the crib is empty;

But rich increase is by the strength of the plough-ox.

This is a commendation of the breeding of cattle, but standing here
certainly not merely as useful knowledge, but as an admonition to the
treatment in a careful, gentle manner, and with thankful recompense of
the ox ([Pro 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010).md), which God has
subjected to man to help him in his labour, and more generally, in so
far as one seeks to gain an object, to the considerate adoption of the
right means for gaining it. אלפים (from אלף, to cling to) are the cattle
giving themselves willingly to the service of men (poet. equivalent to
בּקרים). שׁור (תּור, Arab. thwr), Ved. sthûras, is the Aryan-Semitic
name of the plough-ox. The noun אבוּס (= אבוּס like אטוּן, אמוּן)
denotes the fodder-trough, from אבס, to feed, and thus perhaps as to its
root-meaning related to φάτνη (πάτνη), and may thus also designate the
receptacle for grain where the corn for the provender or feeding of the
cattle is preserved - מאבוּס, [Jer
50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md), at least has this wider
signification of the granary; but there exists no reason to depart here
from the nearest signification of the word: if a husbandman is not
thoughtful about the care and support of the cattle by which he is
assisted in his labour, then the crib is empty - he has nothing to heap
up; he needs not only fodder, but has also nothing. בּר (in pause בּר),
clean (synon. נקי, cf. at [Pro 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#026).md),
corresponds with our baar \[bare\] = bloss \[nudus\]. Its derivation is
obscure. The בּ, 4b, is that of the mediating cause: by the strength of
the plough-ox there is a fulness of grain gathered into the barn
(תּבוּאות, from בּוא, to gather in, anything gathered in). רב־ is the
inverted בּר. Striking if also accidental is the frequency of the א and
ב in [Pro 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004.md). This is continued in
[Pro 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005.md), where the collector gives
two proverbs, the first of which commences with a word beginning with א,
and the second with one beginning with ב:

[Proverbs 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 14:5</span></span>

Striking if also accidental is the frequency of the א and ב in [Pro
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004.md). This is continued in [Pro
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005.md), where the collector gives two
proverbs, the first of which commences with a word beginning with א, and
the second with one beginning with ב:

5 A faithful witness does not speak untruth;

But a lying witness breathes out falsehoods.

The right vocalization and sequence of the accents is בּקּשׁ לץ חכמה (ק
with Tsere and the servile Mahpach, חכמה with Munach, because the
following Athnach-word has not two syllables before the tone). As in 5a
עד אמוּנים, so in 5b עד שׁקר is the subject. Different is the relation
of subject and predicate in the second line of the parallel proverbs,
[Pro 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025.md), [Pro
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005.md). With 5a cf. ציר אמוּנים, [Pro
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017.md); and regarding יפיח (one who
breathes out), vid., at [Pro 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019.md);
[Pro 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#017.md).

[Proverbs 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 14:6</span></span>

6 In vain the scorner seeketh wisdom;

But to the man of understanding knowledge is easy.

The general sentence is concrete, composed in the common historical
form. Regarding ואין, necquidquam, vid., at [Pro
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004.md). The participle נקל is here neut.
for נקלּה, something which makes itself easy or light. The frivolous
man, to whom truth is not a matter of conscience, and who recognises no
authority, not even the Supreme, never reaches to truth notwithstanding
all his searching, it remains veiled to him and far remote; but to the
man of understanding, who knows that the fear of God and not
estrangement from God leads to truth, knowledge is an easy matter - he
enters on the right way to this end, he brings the right receptivity,
brings to bear on it the clear eye, and there is fulfilled to him the
saying, "To him that hath it is given."

[Proverbs 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 14:7</span></span>

Three proverbs regarding fools:

7 Go from the presence of a foolish man,

And surely thou hast not known lips of knowledge;

i.e., surely hast not brought into experience that he possesses lips
which express experimental knowledge, or: surely thou must confess on
reflection that no prudent word has come forth from his mouth. If 7b
were intended to assign a motive, then the expression would be כּי
בל־תּדע or וּבל־תּדע ([Isa 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009).md),
according to which Aquila and Theodotion translate, καὶ οὐ μὴ γνῷς. נגד
is the sphere of vision, and מנּגד denotes either away from the sphere
of vision, as e.g., [Isa 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md), or,
inasmuch as מן is used as in מעל, מתּחת, and the like: at a certain
distance from the sphere of vision, but so that one keeps the object in
sight, [Gen 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#016.md). נגד ל denotes, as
the inverted expression [Deu 28:66](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#066.md)
shows, over against any one, so that he has the object visibly before
him, and מנּגד ל, [Jdg 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#034.md), from the
neighbourhood of a place where one has it in view. So also here: go away
from the vis--vis (vis = visûs) of the foolish man, if thou hast to do
with such an one; whence, 7b, follows what he who has gone away must on
looking back say to himself. בל (with the pret. as e.g., [Isa
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023).md) expresses a negative with
emphasis. Nolde and others, also Fleischer, interpret 7b relatively: et
in quo non cognoveris labia scientiae. If וּבל־ידע were the expression
used, then it would be explained after [Pro
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#013.md), for the idea of the foolish man
is extended: and of such an one as absolutely knows not how to speak
anything prudent. But in וּבל־ידעתּ the relative clause intended must be
indicated by the added בּו: and of such an one in whom... Besides, in
this case וּלא (vid., [Psa 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015).md)
would have been nearer than וּבל. The lxx has modified this proverb, and
yet has brought out nothing that is correct; not only the Syr., but also
Hitzig follows it, when he translates, "The foolish man hath everything
before him, but lips of knowledge are a receptacle of knowledge" (וּכלי
דּעת). It racks one's brains to find out the meaning of the first part
here, and, as Bttcher rightly says, who can be satisfied with the "lips
of knowledge" as the "receptacle of knowledge"?

[Proverbs 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 14:8</span></span>

8 The wisdom of the prudent is to observe his way,

And the folly of fools is deceit.

The nearest idea is that of self-deceit, according to which the lxx,
Syr., and Jerome render the word error ("Irrsal"). But מרמה is nowhere
else used of self-deception, and moreover is not the suitable word for
such an idea, since the conception of the dolus malus is constantly
associated with it. Thus the contrast will be this: the wisdom of the
prudent shows itself in this, that he considers his conduct (הבין as
[Pro 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#007.md), cf. [Psa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#002).md), i.e., regulates it carefully,
examining and considering ([Pro 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#016).md)
it according to right and duty; and that on the contrary the folly of
fools shows itself in this, that they aim at the malevolent deception of
their neighbour, and try all kinds of secret ways for the gaining of
this end. The former is wisdom, because from the good only good comes;
the latter is folly or madness, because deception, however long it may
sneak in darkness, yet at last comes to light, and recoils in its
destructive effects upon him from whom it proceeds.

[Proverbs 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 14:9</span></span>

9 The sacrificial offering of fools mocketh;

But between upright men there is good understanding

We may not give to the Hiph. הליץ any meaning which it nowhere has, as,
to excuse (Kimchi), or to come to an agreement by mediation (Schultens).
So we may not make אוילים the subject (Targ., Symmachus, Jerome, Luther,
"fools make sport with sin"), for one is persuaded that אוילים is
equivalent to כל אחר מן האוילים (Immanuel, Meri, and others), which
would be more admissible if we had מליץ (vid., [Pro
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035).md), or if יליץ did not immediately
follow (vid., [Pro 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001).md). Aquila and
Theodotion rightly interpret the relation of the component parts of the
sentence: ἄφρονας χλευάζει πλημμέλια; and this translation of אשׁם also
is correct is we take πλημμέλεια in the sense of a θυσία περὶ
πλημμελείας (Sir. 7:31), in which the Judaeo-Hellenic actually uses it
(vid., Schleusner's Lex.). The idea of sacrificial offering is that of
expiation: it is a penitential work, it falls under the prevailing point
of view of an ecclesiastical punishment, a satisfactio in a
church-disciplinary sense; the forgiveness of sins is conditioned by
this, (1) that the sinner either abundantly makes good by restitution
the injury inflicted on another, or in some other way bears temporal
punishment for it, and (2) that he willingly presents the sacrifices of
rams or of sheep, the value of which the priest has to determine in its
relation to the offence (by a tax-scale from 2 shekels upwards). The Tor
gives accurately the offences which are thus to be atoned for. Here,
with reference to 9b, there particularly comes into view the offence
against property (Lev. 5:20ff.) and against female honour ([Lev
19:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#020).md). Fools fall from one offence
into another, which they have to atone for by the presentation of
sacrificial offerings; the sacrificial offering mocketh them (הליץ with
accus.-object, as [Pro 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028.md); [Psa
119:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#051).md), for it equally derides them
on account of the self-inflicted loss, and on account of the efforts
with which they must make good the effects of their frivolity and
madness; while on the contrary, among men of upright character, רצון, a
relation of mutual favour, prevails, which does not permit that the one
give to the other an indemnity, and apply the Asham- \[אשׁם =
trespass-offering\] Tor. Symmachus rightly: καὶ ἀνάμεσον εὐθέων εὐδοκία.
But the lxx confuses this proverb also. Hitzig, with the Syr., follows
it and translates:

The tents of the foolish are in punishment overthrown \[verfllt\];

The house of the upright is well-pleasing \[wolgefllt\].

Is not this extravagant \[ungereimt = not rhymed\] in spite of the
rhyme? These אהלי \[tents\] extracted from אוילים, and this בית
\[house\] formed out of בין, are nothing but an aimless and tasteless
flourish.

[Proverbs 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 14:10</span></span>

Four proverbs of joy and sorrow in the present and the future:

10 The heart knoweth the trouble of its soul,

And no stranger can intermeddle with its joy.

The accentuation לב יודע seems to point out יודע as an adjective
(Lwenstein: a feeling heart), after [Kg1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009), or genit. (of a feeling heart.md);
but Cod. 1294 and the Jemen Cod., and others, as well as the editions of
Jablonsky and Michaelis, have לב with Rebia, so that this is by itself
to be taken as the subject (cf. the accentuation [Pro
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#005) and under at 16a.md). מרּת has the ר
with Dagesh, and consequently the short Kametz (Michlol 63b), like שׁרּך
[Pro 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008.md), cf. כּרתה, [Jdg
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#028.md), and on the contrary כרּת, [Eze
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004.md); it is the fem. of mōr = morr,
from מרר, adstringere, amarum esse. Regarding לב, in contradistinction
to נפשׁ, vid., Psychol. p. 251. "All that is meant by the Hellenic and
Hellenistic νοῦς, λόγος, συνείδησις, θυμός, is comprehended in καρδία,
and all by which the בשׂר and נפשׁ are affected comes in לב into the
light of consciousness."

The first half of the proverb is clear: the heart, and only it, i.e.,
the man in the centre of his individuality, knows what brings bitterness
to his soul, i.e., what troubles him in the sphere of his natural life
and of the nearest life-circle surrounding him. It thus treats of life
experiences which are of too complex a nature to be capable of being
fully represented to others, and, as we are wont to say, of so delicate
a nature that we shrink from uncovering them and making them known to
others, and which on this account must be kept shut up in our own
hearts, because no man is so near to us, or has so fully gained our
confidence, that we have the desire and the courage to pour out our
hearts to him from their very depths. Yet the saying, "Every one knows
where the shoe pinches him" ([Kg1
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#038).md), stands nearer to this proverb;
here this expression receives a psychological, yet a sharper and a
deeper expression, for the knowledge of that which grieves the soul is
attributed to the heart, in which, as the innermost of the
soul-corporeal life, it reflects itself and becomes the matter-of-fact
of the reflex consciousness in which it must shut itself up, but also
for the most part without external expression. If we now interpret
לא־יתערב as prohibitive, then this would stand (with this exception,
that in this case אל instead of לא is to be expected) in opposition,
certainly not intended, to the exhortation, [Rom
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#015.md), "Rejoice with them that do
rejoice," and to the saying, "Distributed joy is doubled joy,
distributed sorrow is half sorrow;" and an admonition to leave man alone
with his joy, instead of urging him to distribute it, does not run
parallel with 10a. Therefore we interpret the fut. as potentialis. As
there is a soul-sorrow of the man whose experience is merely a matter of
the heart, so there is also a soul-joy with which no other (vid.,
regarding זר, p. 135, and cf. here particularly [Job
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#027).md) intermeddleth (ההערב בּ like
[Psa 106:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#035).md), in which no other can
intermeddle, because his experience, as e.g., of blessed spiritual
affection or of benevolent feeling, is purely of a personal nature, and
admits of no participation (cf. on ἔκρυψε, [Mat
13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044).md), and thus of no communication
to others. Elster well observes: "By this thought, that the innermost
feelings of a man are never fully imparted to another man, never
perfectly cover themselves with the feelings of another, yea, cannot at
all be fully understood by another, the worth and the significance of
each separate human personality is made conspicuous, not one of which is
the example of a species, but each has its own peculiarity, which no one
of countless individuals possesses. At the same time the proverb has the
significance, that it shows the impossibility of a perfect fellowship
among men, because one never wholly understands another. Thereby it is
indicated that no human fellowship can give true salvation, but only the
fellowship with God, whose love and wisdom are capable of shining
through the most secret sanctuary of human personality." Thus also
Dchsel (but he interprets 10b admonitorily): "Each man is a little world
in himself, which God only fully sees through and understands. His
sorrow appertaining to his innermost life, and his joy, another is never
able fully to transfer to himself. Yea, the most sorrowful of all
experiences, the most inward of all joys, we possess altogether alone,
without any to participate with us."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 14:11</span></span>

11 The house of the wicked is overthrown;

But the tent of the upright flourishes.

In the cogn. proverb, [Pro 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#007.md), line
2 begins with וּבית, but here the apparently firmly-founded house is
assigned to the godless, and on the contrary the tent, easily destroyed,
and not set up under the delusion of lasting for ever, is assigned to
the righteous. While the former is swept away without leaving a trace
behind ([Isa 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#023).md), the latter has
blossoms and shoots (הפריח as inwardly transitive, like [Job
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#009.md); [Psa
92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014).md); the household of such remains
not only preserved in the same state, but in a prosperous, happy manner
it goes forward and upward.

[Proverbs 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 14:12</span></span>

12 There is a way that seemeth right to one,

But the end thereof are the ways of death.

This is literally repeated in [Pro
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#025.md). The rightness is present only
as a phantom, for it arises wholly from a terrible self-deception; the
man judges falsely and goes astray when, without regard to God and His
word, he follows only his own opinions. It is the way of estrangement
from God, of fleshly security; the way of vice, in which the blinded
thinks to spend his life, to set himself to fulfil his purposes; but the
end thereof (אחריתהּ with neut. fem.: the end of this intention, that in
which it issues) are the ways of death. He who thus deceives himself
regarding his course of life, sees himself at last arrived at a point
from which every way which now further remains to him leads only down to
death. The self-delusion of one ends in death by the sentence of the
judge, that of another in self-murder; of one in loathsome disease, of
another in a slow decay under the agony of conscience, or in sorrow over
a henceforth dishonoured and distracted life.

[Proverbs 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 14:13</span></span>

13 Even in the midst of laughter the heart experiences sadness;

And to it, joy, the end is sorrow.

Every human heart carries the feeling of disquiet and of separation from
its true home, and of the nothingness, the transitoriness of all that is
earthly; and in addition to this, there is many a secret sorrow in every
one which grows out of his own corporeal and spiritual life, and from
his relation to other men; and this sorrow, which is from infancy onward
the lot of the human heart, and which more and more depends and
diversifies itself in the course of life, makes itself perceptible even
in the midst of laughter, in spite of the mirth and merriment, without
being able to be suppressed or expelled from the soul, returning always
the more intensely, the more violently we may have for a time kept it
under and sunk it in unconsciousness. Euchel cites here the words of the
poet, according to which 13a is literally true:

"No, man is not made for joy;

Why weep his eyes when in heart he laughs?"

(Note: "Nein, der Mensch ist zur Freude nicht gemacht, Darum weint sein
Aug' wenn er herzlich lacht.")

From the fact that sorrow is the fundamental condition of humanity, and
forms the background of laughter, it follows, 13b, that in general it is
not good for man to give himself up to joy, viz., sensual (worldly), for
to it, joy, the end (the issue) is sorrow. That is true also of the
final end, which according to that saying, μακάριοι οἱ κλαίοντες νῦν ὅτι
γελάσετε, changes laughter into weeping, and weeping into laughter. The
correction אחרית השּׂמחה (Hitzig) presses upon the Mishle style an
article in such cases rejected, and removes a form of expression of the
Hebr. syntaxis ornata, which here, as at [Isa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006.md), is easily obviated, but which is
warranted by a multitude of other examples, vid., at [Pro
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004.md) (also [Pro
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#022).md), and cf. Philippi's Status
Const. p. 14f., who regards the second word, as here שׂמהה, after the
Arab., as accus. But in cases like שׂנאי שׁקר, although not in cases
such as [Ezr 2:62](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#062.md), the accus.
rendering is tenable, and the Arab. does not at all demand it.

(Note: Regarding the supplying (ibdâl) of a foregoing genitive or accus.
pronoun of the third person by a definite or indefinite following, in
the same case as the substantive, Samachschar speaks in the Mufassal, p.
94ff., where, as examples, are found: raeituhu Zeidan, I have seen him,
the Zeid; marartu bihi Zeidin, I have gone over with him, the Zeid;
saraftu wugûhahâ awwalihâ, in the flight I smote the heads of the same,
their front rank. Vid., regarding this anticipation of the definite idea
by an indefinite, with explanations of it, Fleischer's Makkar, Additions
et Corrections, p. xl. col. 2, and Dieterici's Mutanabbi, p. 341, l.
13.)

In the old Hebr. this solutio of the st. constr. belongs to the
elegances of the language; it is the precursor of the vulgar post-bibl.
אחרייהּ שׂל־שׂמחה. That the Hebr. may also retain a gen. where more or
fewer parts of a sentence intervene between it and its governing word,
is shown by such examples as [Isa
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md); [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md); [Isa
61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007.md).

(Note: These examples moreover do not exceed that which is possible in
the Arab., vid., regarding this omission of the mudâf, where this is
supplied from the preceding before a genitive, Samachschar's Mufassal,
p. 34, l. 8-13. Perhaps לחמך, [Oba
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#007), of thy bread = the (men.md) of thy
bread, is an example of the same thing.)

[Proverbs 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 14:14</span></span>

There follows a series of proverbs which treat of the wicked and the
good, and of the relation between the foolish and the wise:

14 He that is of a perverse heart is satisfied with his own ways;

And a good man from himself.

We first determine the subject conception. סוּג לב (one turning aside
τῆς καρδίας or τὴν καρδίαν) is one whose heart is perverted, נסוג,
turned away, viz., from God, [Psa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md). The Book of Proverbs contains
besides of this verb only the name of dross (recedanea) derived from it;
סוּג, separated, drawn away, is such a half passive as סוּר, [Isa
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021.md), שׁוּב, [Mic
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008), etc. (Olsh. 245a.md). Regarding אישׁ
טוב, vid., at [Pro 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002.md), cf. [Pro
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022.md) : a man is so called whose
manner of thought and of action has as its impulse and motive
self-sacrificing love. When it is said of the former that he is
satisfied with his own ways, viz., those which with heart turned away
from God he enters upon, the meaning is not that they give him peace or
bring satisfaction to him (Lwenstein), but we see from [Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md); [Pro
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#020.md), that this is meant
recompensatively: he gets, enjoys the reward of his wandering in
estrangement from God. It is now without doubt seen that 14b expresses
that wherein the benevolent man finds his reward. We will therefore not
explain (after [Pro 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#015.md), cf. [Num
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#026.md); [Sa2
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#010).md): the good man turns himself
away from him, or the good man stands over him (as Jerome, Venet., after
[Ecc 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007).md); - this rendering gives no
contrast, or at least a halting one. The מן of מעליו must be parallel
with that of מדּרכיו. From the lxx, ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν διανοημάτων αὐτοῦ, the
Syr. rightly: from the fruit (religiousness) of his soul; the Targ.:
from his fruit. Buxtorf, against Cappellus, has already perceived that
here no other phrase but the explanation of מעליו by ex eo quod penes se
est lies at the foundation. We could, after [Pro
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014.md), also explain: from that which he
perceives as his obligation (duty); yet that other explanation lies
proportionally nearer, but yet no so that we refer the suffix to the
backslider of 14a: in it (his fate) the good man is satisfied, for this
contrast also halts, the thought is not in the spirit of the Book of
Proverbs (for [Pro 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#016.md) does not
justify it); and in how totally different a connection of thought מעליו
is used in the Book of Proverbs, is shown by [Pro
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#017.md); but generally the Scripture
does not use שׂבע of such satisfaction, it has, as in 14a, also in 14b,
the recompensative sense, according to the fundamental principle, ὃ ἐὰν
σπείρῃ ἄνθρωπος τοῦτο καὶ θερίσει ([Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007).md). The suffix refers back to the
subject, as we say: רוּחי עלי, נפשׁי עלי (Psychol. p. 152). But
considerations of an opposite kind also suggest themselves. Everywhere
else מעל refers not to that which a man has within himself, but that
which he carries without; and also that מעליו can be used in the sense
of משּׁעליו, no evidence can be adduced: it must be admitted to be
possible, since the writer of the Chronicles ([Ch2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#004).md) ventures to use בהכין. Is מעליו
thus used substantively: by his leaves (Aben Ezra and others)? If one
compares [Pro 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#028.md) with [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md), this explanation is not absurd;
but why then did not the poet rather use מפּריו? We come finally to the
result, that ומעליו, although it admits a connected interpretation, is
an error of transcription. But the correction is not וּמעלּיו (Elster)
nor וּמעלליו (Cappellus), for עלּים and עללים, deeds, are words which do
not exist; nor is it וּמפּעליו (Bertheau) nor וּמגּמליו (Ewald), but
וּממּעלליו (which Cappellus regarded, but erroneously, as the lxx
phrase); for (1) throughout almost the whole O.T., from [Jdg
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#019.md) to [Zac
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018.md), דרכים and מעללים are
interchangeable words, and indeed almost an inseparable pair, cf.
particularly [Jer 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010); and (2.md) when
Isaiah ([Isa 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010).md) says, אמרו צדיק
כי־טוב כּי־פרי מעלליהם יאכלוּ, this almost sounds like a prophetical
paraphrase of the second line of the proverb, which besides by this
emendation gains a more rhythmical sound and a more suitable compass.

(Note: As here an ל too few is written, so at [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001) (ולשׂרים.md) and [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014) (לציים) one too many..md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 14:15</span></span>

15 The simple believeth every word;

But the prudent takes heed to his step.

We do not translate, "every thing," for "word" and faith are correlates,
[Psa 106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024.md), and פּתי is the
non-self-dependent who lets himself be easily persuaded by the talk of
another: he believes every word without proving it, whether it is
well-meant, whether it is true, whether it is salutary and useful, so
that he is thus, without having any firm principle, and without any
judgment of his own, driven about hither and thither; the prudent, on
the other hand, considers and marks his step, that he may not take a
false step or go astray, he proves his way (8a), he takes no step
without thought and consideration (בּין or הבין with ל, to consider or
reflect upon anything, [Psa 73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md), cf.
[Psa 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#015).md) - he makes sure steps with
his feet ([Heb 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013).md), without
permitting himself to waver and sway by every wind of doctrine ([Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014).md).

[Proverbs 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 14:16</span></span>

16 The wise feareth and departeth from evil;

But the fool loseth his wits and is regardless.

Our editions have ירא with Munach, as if חכם ירא were a substantive with
its adjective; but Cod. 1294 has חכם with Rebia, and thus it must be:
חכם is the subject, and what follows is its complex predicate. Most
interpreters translate 16b: the fool is over-confident (Zckler), or the
fool rushes on (Hitzig), as also Luther: but a fool rushes wildly
through, i.e., in a daring, presumptuous manner. But התעבּר denotes
everywhere nothing else than to fall into extreme anger, to become
heated beyond measure, [Pro 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#017.md) (cf.
[Pro 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002).md), [Deu
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#026.md), etc. Thus 16a and 16b are fully
contrasted. What is said of the wise will be judged after [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md), cf. [Psa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015.md); [Psa
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027.md) : the wise man has fear, viz.,
fear of God, or rather, since האלהים is not directly to be supplied,
that careful, thoughtful, self-mistrusting reserve which flows from the
reverential awe of God; the fool, on the contrary, can neither rule nor
bridle his affections, and without any just occasion falls into
passionate excitement. But on the other side he is self-confident,
regardless, secure; while the wise man avoids the evil, i.e., carefully
goes out of its way, and in N.T. phraseology "works out his own
salvation with fear and trembling."

[Proverbs 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 14:17</span></span>

This verse, as if explanatory of מתעבר, connects itself with this
interpretation of the contrasts, corresponding to the general usus
loquendi, and particularly to the Mishle style.

One who is quick to anger worketh folly,

And a man of intrigues is hated.

Ewald finds here no right contrast. He understands אישׁ מזמּה in a good
sense, and accordingly corrects the text, substituting for ישׂנא, ישׁוּא
(ישׁוּא), for he translates: but the man of consideration bears
(properly smooths, viz., his soul). On the other hand it is also to be
remarked, that אישׁ מזמה, when it occurs, is not to be understood
necessarily in a good sense, since מזמה is used just like מזמות, at one
time in a good and at another in a bad sense, and that we willingly miss
the "most complete sense" thus arising, since the proverb, as it stands
in the Masoretic text, is good Hebrew, and needs only to be rightly
understood to let nothing be missed in completeness. The contrast, as
Ewald seeks here to represent it (also Hitzig, who proposes ישׁאן: the
man of consideration remains quiet; Syr. ramys, circumspect), we have in
[Pro 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029.md), where the μακρόθυμος
stands over against the ὀξύθυμος (אף or אפּים of the breathing of anger
through the nose, cf. Theocritus, i. 18: καὶ οἱ ἀεὶ δριμεῖα χολὰ ποτὶ
ῥινὶ κάθηται). Here the contrast is different: to the man who is quick
to anger, who suddenly gives expression to his anger and displeasure,
stands opposed the man of intrigues, who contrives secret vengeance
against those with whom he is angry. Such a deceitful man, who contrives
evil with calculating forethought and executes it in cold blood (cf.
[Psa 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007).md), is hated; while on the
contrary the noisy lets himself rush forward to inconsiderate, mad
actions, but is not hated on that account; but if in his folly he
injures or disgraces himself, or is derided, or if he even does injury
to the body and the life of another, and afterwards with terror sees the
evil done in its true light, then he is an object of compassion.
Theodotion rightly: (ἀνὴρ δὲ) διαβουλιῶν μισηθήσεται, and Jerome: vir
versutus odiosus est (not the Venet. ἀνὴρ βδελυγμῶν, for this
signification has only זמּה, and that in the sing.); on the contrary,
the lxx, Syr., Targum, and Symmachus incorrectly understand איש מזמות in
bonam partem.

[Proverbs 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 14:18</span></span>

18 The simple have obtained folly as an inheritance;

But the prudent put on knowledge as a crown.

As a parallel word to נחלוּ, יכתּרוּ (after the Masora defective), also
in the sense of Arab. âkthar, multiplicare, abundare (from Arab.
kathura, to be much, perhaps

(Note: According to rule the Hebr. ש becomes in Arab. ṯ, as in Aram. ת;
but kthar might be from ktar, an old verb rarely found, which derivata
with the idea of encircling (wall) and of rounding (bunch) point to.)

properly comprehensive, encompassing), would be appropriate, but it is a
word properly Arabic. On the other hand, inappropriate is the meaning of
the Heb.-Aram. כּתּר, to wait (properly waiting to surround, to go round
any one, cf. manere aliquem or aliquod), according to which Aquila,
ἀναμενούσιν, and Jerome, expectabunt. Also הכתּיר, to encompass in the
sense of to embrace (lxx κρατήσουσιν), does not suffice, since in the
relation to נחלו one expects an idea surpassing this. Certainly there is
a heightening of the idea in this, that the Hiph. in contradistinction
to נחל would denote an object of desire spontaneously sought for. But
far stronger and more pointed is the heightening of the idea when we
take יכתרו as the denom. of כּרת (Gr. κίταρις, κίδαρις, Babyl. כדר,
cudur, cf. כּדּוּר, a rounding, sphaera). Thus Theodotion, στεφθήσονται.
The Venet. better actively, ἐστέψαντο (after Kimchi: ישׂימו הדעת ככתר על
ראשם), the Targ., Jerome, Luther (but not the Syr., which translates
נחלו by "to inherit," but יכתרו by μεριοῦνται, which the lxx has for
נחלו). The bibl. language has also (Ps. 142:8) הכתיר in the denom.
signification of to place a crown, and that on oneself; the non-bibl.
has מכתיר (like the bibl. מעטיר) in the sense of distributor of crowns,

(Note: Vid., Wissenschaft, Kunst, Judenthum (1838), p. 240.)

and is fond of the metaphor כתר הדעת, crown of knowledge. With those not
self-dependent (vid., regarding the plur. form of פּתי, p. 56), who are
swayed by the first influence, the issue is, without their willing it,
that they become habitual fools: folly is their possession, i.e., their
property. The prudent, on the contrary, as [Pro
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#015.md) designates them, have
thoughtfully to ponder their step to gain knowledge as a crown (cf.
העשׁיר, to gain riches, הפריח, 11b, to gain flowers, Gesen. 53, 2).
Knowledge is to them not merely an inheritance, but a possession won,
and as such remains with them a high and as it were a kingly ornament.

[Proverbs 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 14:19</span></span>

19 The wicked must bow before the good,

And the godless stand at the doors of the righteous.

The good, viz., that which is truly good, which has love as its
principle, always at last holds the supremacy. The good men who manifest
love to men which flows from love to God, come finally forward, so that
the wicked, who for a long time played the part of lords, bow themselves
willingly or unwillingly before them, and often enough it comes about
that godless men fall down from their prosperity and their places of
honour so low, that they post themselves at the entrance of the stately
dwelling of the righteous ([Pro
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022).md), waiting for his going out and
in, or seeking an occasion of presenting to him a supplication, or also
as expecting gifts to be bestowed ([Psa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025).md). The poor man Lazarus πρὸς τὸν
πυλῶνα of the rich man, [Luk 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#020.md),
shows, indeed, that this is not always the case on this side of the
grave. שׁחוּ has, according to the Masora (cf. Kimchi's Wrterbuch under
שׁחח), the ultima accented; the accentuation of the form סכּוּ wavers
between the ult. and penult. Olsh. p. 482f., cf. Gesen. 68, Anm. 10. The
substantival clause 19b is easily changed into a verbal clause: they
come (Syr.), appear, stand (incorrectly the Targ.: they are judged in
the gates of the righteous).

[Proverbs 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 14:20</span></span>

Three proverbs on the hatred of men:

20 The poor is hated even by his neighbour;

But of those who love the rich there are many.

This is the old history daily repeating itself. Among all people is the
saying and the complaint:

Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos,

Tempora si fuerint nubilia solus eris.

(Note: Ovid, Trist. i. 8.)

The Book of Proverbs also speaks of this lamentable phenomenon. It is a
part of the dark side of human nature, and one should take notice of it,
so that when it goes well with him, he may not regard his many friends
as all genuine, and when he becomes poor, he may not be surprised by the
dissolution of earlier friendship, but may value so much the higher
exceptions to the rule. The connection of the passive with ל of the
subject (cf. [Pro 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#013).md), as in the
Greek with the dative, is pure Semitic; sometimes it stands with מן, but
in the sense of ἀπό, [Sol 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#010.md), before
the influence of the West led to its being used in the sense of ὑπό
(Ges. 143, 2); ישּׂנא, is hated (Cod. 1294: ישּׂנא, connects with the
hatred which is directed against the poor also the indifference which
makes him without sympathy, for one feels himself troubled by him and
ashamed.

[Proverbs 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 14:21</span></span>

21 Whoever despiseth his neighbour committeth sin;

But whoever hath compassion on the suffering - blessings on him!

One should regard every human being, especially such as God has placed
near to him, as a being having the same origin, as created in the image
of God, and of the same lofty destination, and should consider himself
as under obligation to love him. He who despiseth his neighbour (write
בּז with Metheg, and vid., regarding the constr. with dat. object. [Pro
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030.md), cf. [Pro
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#012.md); [Pro
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#013).md) sins in this respect, that he
raises himself proudly and unwarrantably above him; that the honour and
love he shows to him he measures not by the rule of duty and of
necessity, but according to that which is pleasing to himself; and in
that he refuses to him that which according to the ordinance of God he
owes him. In [Pro 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021.md) the Chethı̂b
עניּים and the Kerı̂ ענוים (vid., at [Psa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013).md) interchange in an inexplicable
way; עני is the bowed down (cf. Arab. ma'nuww, particularly of the
prisoner, from 'ana, fut. ya'nw, to bow, bend), ענו (Arab. 'anin, with
the art. âl'niy, from the intrans. 'aniya, to be bowed down) the patient
bearer who in the school of suffering has learned humility and meekness.
One does not see why the Kerı̂ here exchanges that passive idea for this
ethical one, especially since, in proving himself to be מחונן
(compassionate) (for which elsewhere the part. Kal חונן, [Pro
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031.md); [Pro
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017.md); [Pro
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#008).md), one must be determined only by
the needy condition of his neighbour, and not by his (the neighbour's)
moral worthiness, the want of which ought to make him twofold more an
object of our compassion. All the old translators, from the lxx to the
Venet. and Luther, on this account adopt the Chethı̂b.

[Proverbs 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 14:22</span></span>

The proverb terminating ([Pro 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021).md)
with אשׁריו (cf. [Pro 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#020).md) is now
followed by one not less singularly formed, commencing with הלא (cf.
[Pro 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001).md).

Will they not go astray who devise evil,

And are not mercy and truth to those who devise good?

The part. חרשׁ signifies both the plougher and the artisan; but on this
account to read with Hitzig both times חרשׁי, i.e., machinatores, is
nothing less than advisable, since there is connected with this
metaphorical חרשׁ, as we have shown at [Pro
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029.md), not only the idea of
fabricating, but also that of ploughing. Just so little is there any
reason for changing with Hitzig, against all old translators, יתעוּ into
ירעוּ: will it not go ill with them...; the fut. יתעו (cf. [Isa
63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017).md) is not to be touched; the perf.
תעו (e.g., [Psa 58:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004).md) would denote
that those who contrive evil are in the way of error, the fut. on the
contrary that they will fall into error (cf. [Pro
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#026.md) with [Job
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#024).md). But if הלא יתעו is the
expression of the result which shall certainly come to such, then 22b
stands as a contrast adapted thereto: and are not, on the contrary,
mercy and truth those who contrive that which is good, i.e., (for that
which befalls them, as [Pro 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#018.md), cf.
[Pro 14:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#035), is made their attribute.md)
are they not an object of mercy and truth, viz., on the part of God and
of men, for the effort which proceeds from love and is directed to the
showing forth of good is rewarded by this, that God and men are merciful
to such and maintain truth to them, stand in truth to them; for חסד ואמת
is to be understood here, as at [Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md), neither of God nor of men
exclusively, but of both together: the wicked who contrive evil lose
themselves on the way to destruction, but grace and truth are the lot of
those who aim at what is good, guarded and guided by which, they reach
by a blessed way a glorious end.

[Proverbs 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 14:23</span></span>

There now follows a considerable series of proverbs ([Pro
14:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#023).md) which, with a single
exception ([Pro 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#024).md), have all this
in common, that one or two key-words in them begin with מ.

23 In all labour there is gain,

But idle talk leadeth only to loss.

Here the key-words are מותר and מחסור (parallel [Pro
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005.md), cf. with [Pro
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024).md), which begin with מ. עצב is
labour, and that earnest and unwearied, as at [Pro
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022.md). If one toils on honestly, then
there always results from it something which stands forth above the
endeavour as its result and product, vid., at [Job
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#011.md), where it is shown how יתר, from
the primary meaning to be stretched out long, acquires the meaning of
that which hangs over, shoots over, copiousness, and gain. By the word
of the lips, on the contrary, i.e., purposeless and inoperative talk
(דּבר שׂפתים as [Isa 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#005.md), cf. [Job
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#002).md), nothing is gained, but on the
contrary there is only loss, for by it one only robs both himself and
others of time, and wastes strength, which might have been turned to
better purpose, to say nothing of the injury that is thereby done to his
soul; perhaps also he morally injures, or at least discomposes and
wearies others.

[Proverbs 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 14:24</span></span>

24 It is a crown to the wise when they are rich;

But the folly of fools remains folly.

From [Pro 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004.md), 31; [Pro
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#006.md), we see that עטרת חכמים is the
predicate. Thus it is the riches of the wise of which it is said that
they are a crown or an ornament to them. More than this is said, if with
Hitzig we read, after the lxx, ערמם, their prudence, instead of עשׁרם.
For then the meaning would be, that the wise need no other crown than
that which they have in their prudence. But yet far more appropriately
"riches" are called the crown of a wise man when they come to his
wisdom; for it is truly thus that riches, when they are possessed along
with wisdom, contribute not a little to heighten its influence and
power, and not merely because they adorn in their appearance like a
crown, or, as we say, surround as with a golden frame, but because they
afford a variety of means and occasions for self-manifestation which are
denied to the poor. By this interpretation of 24a, 24b comes out also
into the light, without our requiring to correct the first אוּלת, or to
render it in an unusual sense. The lxx and Syr. translate the first אולת
by διατριβή (by a circumlocution), the Targ. by gloria, fame - we know
not how they reach this. Schultens in his Com. renders: crassa opulentia
elumbium crassities, but in his Animadversiones he combines the first
אולת with the Arab. awwale, precedence, which Gesen. approves of. But
although the meaning to be thick (properly coalescere) appertains to the
verbal stem אול as well as the meaning to be before (Arab. âl, âwila,
wâl), yet the Hebr. אוּלת always and everywhere means only folly,

(Note: Ewald's derivation of אויל from און = אוין, null, vain, is not
much better than Heidenheim's from אולי: one who says "perhaps" = a
sceptic, vid., p. 59, note.)

from the fundamental idea crassities (thickness). Hitzig's אוּלת (which
denotes the consequence with which the fool invests himself) we do not
accept, because this word is Hitzig's own invention. Rather לוית is to
be expected: the crown with which fools adorn themselves is folly. But
the sentence: the folly of fools is (and remains) folly (Symmachus,
Jerome, Venet., Luther), needs the emendation as little as [Pro
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#022.md), for, interpreted in connection
with 24a, it denotes that while wisdom is adorned and raised up by
riches, folly on the other hand remains, even when connected with
riches, always the same, without being either thereby veiled or removed
- on the contrary, the fool, when he is rich, exhibits his follies
always more and more. C. B. Michaelis compares Lucian's simia est simia
etiamsi aurea gestet insignia.

[Proverbs 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 14:25</span></span>

25 A witness of truth delivereth souls;

But he who breathes out lies is nothing but deception.

When men, in consequence of false suspicions or of false accusations,
fall into danger of their lives (דיני נפשׁות is the designation in the
later language of the law of a criminal process), then a tongue which,
pressed by conscientiousness and not deterred by cowardice, will utter
the truth, saves them. But a false tongue, which as such (vid., [Pro
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005).md) is a יפח כזבים (after the Masora
at this place ויפח, defective), i.e., is one who breathes out lies
(vid., regarding יפיח at [Pro 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019).md),
is mere deception (lxx, without reading מרמּה \[as Hitzig does\]:
δόλιος). In [Pro 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#017.md) מרמה is to be
interpreted as the object. accus. of יגיד carried forward, but here to
carry forward מצּיל (Arama, Lwenstein) is impracticable - for to deliver
deceit = the deceiver is not expressed in the Hebr. - מרמה is, as
possibly also [Heb 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016) (lxx δόλιος.md),
without אישׁ or עד being supplied, the pred. of the substantival clause:
such an one is deception (in bad Latin, dolositas), for he who utters
forth lies against better knowledge must have a malevolent, deceitful
purpose.

[Proverbs 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 14:26</span></span>

26 In the fear of Jahve lies a strong ground of confidence,

And the children of such an one have a refuge.

The so-called בּ essentiae stands here, as at [Psa
68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005.md); [Psa
55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md); [Isa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004.md), before the subject idea; the
clause: in the fear of God exists, i.e., it is and proves itself, as a
strong ground of confidence, does not mean that the fear of God is
something in which one can rely (Hitzig), but that it has ([Pro
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#019.md); [Jer
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007), and here.md) an inheritance which
is enduring, unwavering, and not disappointing in God, who is the object
of fear; for it is not faith, nor anything else subjective, which is the
rock that bears us, but this Rock is the object which faith lays hold of
(cf. [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016).md). Is now the וּלבניו
to be referred, with Ewald and Zckler, to 'ה? It is possible, as we have
discussed at [Gen 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md).; but in view of
parallels such as [Pro 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#007.md), it is not
probable. He who fears God entails in the Abrahamic way ([Gen
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019).md) the fear of God on his
children, and in this precious paternal inheritance they have a מחסה
(not מחסה, and therefore to be written with Masoretic exactness מחסּה),
a fortress or place of protection, a refuge in every time of need (cf.
[Psa 71:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#005).md). Accordingly, ולבניו
refers back to the 'ירא ה, to be understood from 'ביראת ה (lxx, Luther,
and all the Jewish interpreters), which we find not so doubtful as to
regard on this account the explanation after [Psa
73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md), cf. [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md), as necessary, although we grant
that such an introduction of the N.T. generalization and deepening of
the idea of sonship is to be expected from the Chokma.

[Proverbs 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 14:27</span></span>

27 The fear of Jahve is a fountain of life,

To escape the snares of death.

There springs up a life which makes him who carries in himself (cf. [Joh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014), ἐν αὐτῷ.md) this welling life,
penetrating and strong of will to escape the snares (write after the
Masora ממּקשׁי defective) which death lays, and which bring to an end in
death - a repetition of [Pro 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004.md) with
changed subject.

[Proverbs 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 14:28</span></span>

28 In the multitude of the people lies the king's honour;

And when the population diminishes, it is the downfall of his glory.

The honour or the ornament (vid., regarding הדר, tumere, ampliari, the
root-word of הדר and הדרה at [Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001).md) of a king consists in this, that
he rules over a great people, and that they increase and prosper; on the
other hand, it is the ruin of princely greatness when the people decline
in number and in wealth. Regarding מחתּה, vid., at [Pro
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#014.md). בּאפס signifies prepositionally
"without" (properly, by non-existence), e.g., [Pro
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#020.md), or adverbially "groundless"
(properly, for nothing), [Isa 52:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#004.md);
here it is to be understood after its contrast בּרב־: in the
non-existence, but which is here equivalent to in the ruin (cf. אפס, the
form of which in conjunction is אפס, [Gen
47:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#015).md), lies the misfortune, decay,
ruin of the princedom. The lxx ἐν δὲ ἐκλείψει λαοῦ συντριβὴ δυνάστου.
Certainly רזון (from רזן, Arab. razuna, to be powerful) is to be
interpreted personally, whether it be after the form בּגוד with a fixed,
or after the form יקושׁ with a changeable Kametz; but it may also be an
abstract like שׁלום (= Arab. selâm), and this we prefer, because in the
personal signification רזן, [Pro 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015.md);
[Pro 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#004.md), is used. We have not here
to think of רזון (from רזה), consumption (the Venet. against Kimchi,
πενίας); the choice of the word also is not determined by an intended
amphibology (Hitzig), for this would be meaningless.

[Proverbs 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 14:29</span></span>

29 He that is slow to anger is rich in understanding;

But he that is easily excited carries off folly.

ארך אפּים (constr. of ארך) is he who puts off anger long, viz., the
outbreak of anger, האריך, [Pro 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011.md),
i.e., lets it not come in, but shuts it out long (μακρόθυμος = βραδὺς
εἰς ὀργήν, [Jam 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019).md); and קצר־רוּח,
he who in his spirit and temper, viz., as regards anger (for רוּח
denotes also the breathing out and snorting, [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md); [Isa
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011).md), is short, i.e., (since
shortness of time is meant) is rash and suddenly (cf. quick to anger,
praeceps in iram, 17a) breaks out with it, not ὀλιγόψυχος (but here
ὀξύθυμος), as the lxx translate 17a. The former, who knows how to
control his affections, shows himself herein as "great in understanding"
(cf. [Sa2 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020).md), or as a "man of
great understanding" (Lat. multus prudenti); the contrary is he who
suffers himself to be impelled by his affections into hasty,
inconsiderate action, which is here expressed more actively by מרים
אוּלת. Does this mean that he bears folly to the view (Luther, Umbreit,
Bertheau, Elster, and others)? But for that idea the Mishle style has
other expressions, [Pro 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023.md); [Pro
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#016.md); [Pro
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002.md), cf. [Pro
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#017.md). Or does it mean that he makes
folly high, i.e., shows himself highly foolish (lxx, Syr., Targum,
Fleischer, and others)? But that would be expressed rather by הגדּיל or
הרבּה. Or is it he heightens folly (Lwenstein, Hitzig)? But the remark
that the angry ebullition is itself a gradual heightening of the foolish
nature of such an one is not suitable, for the choleric man, who lets
the evenness of his disposition be interrupted by a breaking forth of
anger, is by no means also in himself a fool. Rashi is right when he
says, מפרישה לחלקו, i.e., (to which also Fleischer gives the preference)
aufert pro portione sua stultitiam. The only appropriate parallel
according to which it is to be explained, is [Pro
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035.md). But not as Ewald: he lifts up
folly, which lies as it were before his feet on his life's path; but: he
takes off folly, in the sense of [Lev
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#008.md), i.e., he carries off folly,
receives a portion of folly; for as to others, so also to himself, when
he returns to calm blood, that which he did in his rage must appear as
folly and madness.

[Proverbs 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 14:30</span></span>

30 A quiet heart is the life of the body,

But covetousness is rottenness in the bones.

Heart, soul, flesh, is the O.T. trichotomy, [Psa
84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md); [Psa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md); the heart is the innermost
region of the life, where all the rays of the bodily and the soul-life
concentrate, and whence they again unfold themselves. The state of the
heart, i.e., of the central, spiritual, soul-inwardness of the man,
exerts therefore on all sides a constraining influence on the bodily
life, in the relation to the heart the surrounding life. Regarding לב
מרפּא, vid., at [Pro 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#018.md). Thus is
styled the quiet heart, which in its symmetrical harmony is like a calm
and clear water-mirror, neither interrupted by the affections, nor
broken through or secretly stirred by passion. By the close connection
in which the corporeal life of man stands to the moral-religious
determination of his intellectual and mediately his soul-life - this
threefold life is as that of one personality, essentially one - the body
has in such quiet of spirit the best means of preserving the life which
furthers the well-being, and co-operates to the calming of all its
disquietude; on the contrary, passion, whether it rage or move itself in
stillness, is like the disease in the bones ([Pro
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004).md), which works onward till it
breaks asunder the framework of the body, and with it the life of the
body. The plur. בּשׂרים occurs only here; Bttcher, 695, says that it
denotes the whole body; but בּשׂר also does not denote the half, בשׂרים
is the surrogate of an abstr.: the body, i.e., the bodily life in the
totality of its functions, and in the entire manifoldness of its
relations. Ewald translates bodies, but בשׂר signifies not the body, but
its material, the animated matter; rather cf. the Arab. âbshâr,
"corporeal, human nature," but which (leaving out of view that this
plur. belongs to a later period of the language) has the parallelism
against it. Regarding קנאה (jealousy, zeal, envy, anger) Schultens is
right: affectus inflammans aestuque indignationis fervidus, from קנא,
Arab. ḳanâ, to be high red.

[Proverbs 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 14:31</span></span>

31 He who oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker;

And whosoever is merciful to the poor, it is an honour to him.

Line first is repeated in [Pro 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md)
somewhat varied, and the relation of the idea in 31b is as [Pro
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017.md), according to which וּמכבּדו is
the predicate and חונן אביון the subject (Symmachus, Targ., Jerome,
Venet., Luther), not the reverse (Syr.); חונן is thus not the 3 per. Po.
(lxx), but the part. Kal (for which 21b has the part. Po. מחונן). The
predicates חרף עשׂהוּ (vid., regarding the perf. Gesen. 126, 3) and
ומכבדו follow one another after the scheme of the Chiasmus. עשׁק has
Munach on the first syllable, on which the tone is thrown back, and on
the second the העמדה sign (vid., Torath Emeth, p. 21), as e.g., פּוטר,
[Pro 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#014.md), and אהב, [Pro
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019.md). The showing of forbearance and
kindness to the poor arising from a common relation to one Creator, and
from respect towards a personality bearing the image of God, is a
conception quite in the spirit of the Chokma, which, as in the Jahve
religion it becomes the universal religion, so in the national law it
becomes the human. Thus also [Job
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015.md), cf. [Pro
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md) of the Epistle of James, which in
many respects has its roots in the Book of Proverbs. [Mat
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040.md) is a New Testament side-piece to
31b.

[Proverbs 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 14:32</span></span>

This verse also contains a key-word beginning with מ, but pairs
acrostically with the proverb following:

When misfortune befalls him, the godless is overthrown;

But the righteous remains hopeful in his death.

When the subject is רעה connected with רשׁע (the godless), then it may
be understood of evil thought and action ([Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015).md) as well as of the experience of
evil (e.g., [Pro 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#021).md). The lxx (and
also the Syr., Targ., Jerome, and Venet.) prefers the former, but for
the sake of producing an exact parallelism changes במותו \[in his
death\] into בתמּו \[in his uprightness\], reversing also the relation
of the subject and the predicate: ὁ δὲ πεποιθὼς τῇ ἑαυτοῦ ὁσιότητι (the
Syr.: in this, that he has no sin; Targ.: when he dies) δίκαιος. But no
Scripture word commends in so contradictory a manner self-righteousness,
for the verb חסה never denotes self-confidence, and with the exception
of two passages ([Jdg 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#015.md); [Isa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002).md), where it is connected with
בּצל, is everywhere the exclusive (vid., [Psa
118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008)..md) designation of confidence
resting itself in God, even without the 'בה, as here as at [Psa
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md). The parallelism leads us to
translate ברעתו, not on account of his wickedness, but with Luther, in
conformity with במותו, in his misfortune, i.e., if it befall him. Thus
Jeremiah ([Jer 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012).md) says of the sins
of his people: בּאפלה ידּחוּ, in the deep darkness they are driven on
(Niph. of דחח = דחה), and [Pro 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016.md)
contains an exactly parallel thought: the godless stumble ברעה, into
calamity. Ewald incorrectly: in his calamity the wicked is overthrown -
for what purpose then the pronoun? The verb דחה frequently means,
without any addition, "to stumble over heaps," e.g., [Psa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md); 36:13. The godless in his
calamity is overthrown, or he fears in the evils which befall him the
intimations of the final ruin; on the contrary, the righteous in his
death, even in the midst of extremity, is comforted, viz., in God in
whom he confides. Thus understood, Hitzig thinks that the proverb is not
suitable for a time in which, as yet, men had not faith in immortality
and in the resurrection. Yet though there was no such revelation then,
still the pious in death put their confidence in Jahve, the God of life
and of salvation - for in Jahve

(Note: Vid., my Bibl.-prophet. Theol. (1845), p. 268, cf. Bibl.
Psychologie (1861), p. 410, and Psalmen (1867), p. 52f., and elsewhere.)

there was for ancient Israel the beginning, middle, and end of the work
of salvation - and believing that they were going home to Him,
committing their spirit into His hands ([Psa
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#006).md), they fell asleep, though
without any explicit knowledge, yet not without the hope of eternal
life. Job also knew that ([Job 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008)..md)
between the death of those estranged from God and of those who feared
God there was not only an external, but a deep essential distinction;
and now the Chokma opens up a glimpse into the eternity heavenwards,
[Pro 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#024.md), and has formed, [Pro
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028.md), the expressive and distinctive
word אל־מות, for immortality, which breaks like a ray from the morning
sun through the night of the Sheol.

[Proverbs 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 14:33</span></span>

33 Wisdom rests in the heart of the man of understanding;

But the heart of fools it maketh itself known.

Most interpreters know not what to make of the second line here. The lxx
(and after it the Syr.), and as it appears, also Aquila and Theodotion,
insert οὐ; the Targ. improves the Peshito, for it inserts אוּלת (so that
[Pro 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023.md); [Pro
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#016.md), and [Pro
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002) are related.md). And Abulwald
explains: in the heart of fools it is lost; Euchel: it reels about; but
these are imaginary interpretations resting on a misunderstanding of the
passages, in which ידע means to come to feel, and הודיע to give to feel
(to punish, correct). Kimchi rightly adheres to the one ascertained
meaning of the words, according to which the Venet. μέσον δὲ ἀφρόνων
γνωσθήσεται. So also the translation of Jerome: et indoctos quosque
(quoque) erudiet, is formed, for he understands the "and is manifest
among fools" (Luther) not merely, as C. B. Michaelis, after the saying:
opposita juxta se posita magis elucescunt, but of a becoming manifest,
which is salutary to these. Certainly בּקרב can mean among = in the
circle, of [Pro 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#031.md); but if, as here
and e.g., [Jer 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md), בקרב is
interchanged with בלב, and if חכמה בקרב is the subject spoken of, as
[Kg1 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#028.md), then בקרב does not mean
among (in the midst of), but in the heart of the fool. According to
this, the Talmud rightly, by comparison with the current proverb (Meza
85b): אסתירא בלגינא קישׁ קישׁ קריא, a stater in a flaggon cries Kish,
Kish, i.e., makes much clatter. In the heart of the understanding wisdom
rests, i.e., remains silent and still, for the understanding feels
himself personally happy in its possession, endeavours always the more
to deepen it, and lets it operate within; on the contrary, wisdom in the
heart of fools makes itself manifest: they are not able to keep to
themselves the wisdom which they imagine they possess, or the portion of
wisdom which is in reality theirs; but they think, as it is said in
Persius: Scire tuum nihil est nisi scire hoc te sciat alter. They
discredit and waste their little portion of wisdom (instead of thinking
on its increase) by obtrusive ostentatious babbling.

[Proverbs 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">pro 14:34</span></span>

Two proverbs follow regarding the state and its ruler:

34 Righteousness exalteth a nation,

And sin is a disgrace to the people.

The Hebr. language is richer in synonyms of "the people" than the
German. גּוי (formed like the non-bibl. מוי, water, and נוי,
corporealness, from גּוה, to extend itself from within outward; cf. [Pro
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#003.md), גּפּי, [Pro
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013), גּו.md) is, according to the usus
loq., like natio the people, as a mass swollen up from a common origin,
and עם, 28a (from עמם, to bind), the people as a confederation held
together by a common law; לאם (from לאם, to unite, bind together) is the
mass (multitude) of the people, and is interchanged sometimes with גוי,
[Gen 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md), and sometimes with עם,
[Pro 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#028.md). In this proverb, לאמּים
stands indeed intentionally in the plur., but not גוי, with the plur. of
which גּוים, the idea of the non-Israelitish nations, too easily
connects itself. The proverb means all nations without distinction, even
Israel (cf. under [Isa 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004).md) not
excluded. History everywhere confirms the principle, that not the
numerical, nor the warlike, nor the political, nor yet the intellectual
and the so-called civilized greatness, is the true greatness of a
nation, and determines the condition of its future as one of progress;
but this is its true greatness, that in its private, public, and
international life, צדקה, i.e., conduct directed by the will of God,
according to the norm of moral rectitude, rules and prevails.
Righteousness, good manners, and piety are the things which secure to a
nation a place of honour, while, on the contrary, חטּאת, sin, viz.,
prevailing, and more favoured and fostered than contended against in the
consciousness of the moral problem of the state, is a disgrace to the
people, i.e., it lowers them before God, and also before men who do not
judge superficially or perversely, and also actually brings them down.
רומם, to raise up, is to be understood after [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md), cf. [Pro
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#004.md), and is to be punctuated תּרומם,
with Munach of the penult., and the העמדה-sign with the Tsere of the
last syllable. Ben-Naphtali punctuates thus: תּרומם. In 34b all the
artifices of interpretation (from Nachmani to Schultens) are to be
rejected, which interpret חסד as the Venet. (ἔλεος δὲ λαῶν ἁμαρτία) in
its predominant Hebrew signification. It has here, as at [Lev
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017.md) (but not [Job
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014).md), the signification of the Syr.
chesdho, opprobrium; the Targ. חסדּא, or more frequently חסּוּדא, as
among Jewish interpreters, is recognised by Chanan'el and Rashbam. That
this חסד is not foreign to the Mishle style, is seen from the fact that
חסּד, [Pro 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#010.md), is used in the sense
of the Syr. chasedh. The synon. Syr. chasam, invidere, obtrectare, shows
that these verbal stems are formed from the R. הס, stringere, to strike.
Already it is in some measure perceived how חסד, Syr. chasadh, Arab.
hasada, may acquire the meaning of violent love, and by the mediation of
the jealousy which is connected with violent love, the signification of
grudging, and thus of reproach and of envy; yet this is more manifest if
one thinks of the root-signification stringere, in the meaning of
loving, as referred to the subject, in the meanings of disgrace and
envy, as from the subject directed to others. Ewald (51c) compares חסל
and חסר, Ethiop. chasra, in the sense of carpere, and on the other side
חסה in the sense of "to join;" but חסה does not mean to join (vid., [Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012).md) and instead of carpere, the idea
more closely connected with the root is that of stringere, cf. stringere
folia ex arboribus (Caesar), and stringere (to diminish, to squander,
strip) rem ingluvie (Horace, Sat. i. 2. 8). The lxx has here read חסר
([Pro 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#022).md), diminution, decay,
instead of חסד (shame); the quid pro quo is not bad, the Syr. accepts
it, and the miseros facit of Jerome, and Luther's verderben
(destruction) corresponds with this phrase better than with the common
traditional reading which Symmachus rightly renders by ὄνειδος.

[Proverbs 14:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">pro 14:35</span></span>

35 The king's favour is towards a prudent servant,

And his wrath visits the base.

Regarding the contrasts משׂכּיל and מבישׁ, vid., at [Pro
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005.md); cf. [Pro
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004.md). The substantival clause 35a may
mean: the king's favour has (possesses)..., as well as: it is imparted
to, an intelligent servant; the arrangement of the words is more
favourable to the latter rendering. In 35b the gender of the verb is
determined by attraction after the pred., as is the case also at [Gen
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#008.md); [Job
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031.md), Ewald, 317c. And "his wrath" is
equivalent to is the object of it, cf. 22b, [Pro
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#018.md). The syntactical character of
the clause does not permit the supplying of ל from 35a. Luther's
translation proceeds only apparently from this erroneous supposition.
