### [Jeremiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 33:1</span></span>

While Jeremiah was still in confinement in the court of the prison
belonging to the palace (see [Jer
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002)), the word of the Lord came to
him the second time. This word of God is attached by שׁנית to the
promise of Jer 32. It followed, too, not long, perhaps, after the other,
which it further serves to confirm. - After the command to call on Him,
that He might make known to him great and hidden things ([Jer
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002), [Jer
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003)), the Lord announces that,
although Jerusalem shall be destroyed by the Chaldeans, He shall yet
restore it, bring back the captives of Judah and Israel, purify the city
from its iniquities, and make it the glory and praise of all the people
of the earth ([Jer 33:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004)), so that in
it and in the whole land joy will again prevail ([Jer
33:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010)). Then the Lord promises the
restoration of the kingdom through the righteous sprout of David - of
the priesthood, too, and sacrificial worship ([Jer
33:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014)); He promises also the
everlasting duration of these two ordinances of grace ([Jer
33:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#019)), because His covenant with
the seed of Jacob and David shall be as enduring as the natural
ordinance of day and night, and the laws of heaven and earth ([Jer
33:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#023)). - The promises thus fall
into two parts. First, there is proclaimed the restoration of the people
and kingdom to a new and glorious state of prosperity ([Jer
33:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004)); then the re-establishment of
the monarchy and the priesthood to a new and permanent condition ([Jer
33:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014)). In the first part, the
promise given in [Jer 32:36-44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#036) is
further carried out; in the second, the future form of the kingdom is
more plainly depicted.

[Jeremiah 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 33:2</span></span>

Introduction. - [Jer 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002). "Thus saith
Jahveh who makes it, Jahveh who forms it in order to establish it,
Jahveh is His name: [Jer 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003). Call on
me and I will answer thee, and tell thee great and hidden things which
thou knowest not." The reference of the suffixes in עשׂהּ, אותהּ, and
הכינהּ is evident from the contents of the propositions: the Lord does
what He says, and forms what He wants to make, in order to accomplish
it, i.e., He completes what He has spoken and determined on. יצר, to
frame, namely, in the mind, as if to think out, just as in [Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011) : the expression is parallel
with חשׁב; in this sense also we find [Isa
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011). הכין, to establish, realize
what has been determined on, prepare, is also found in [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006); [Isa
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#020), but more frequently in Jeremiah
([Jer 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012); [Jer
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#012), [Jer
51:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#015)), and pretty often in the Old
Testament generally. On the phrase "Jahveh is His name," cf. [Jer
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035). The idea contained in [Jer
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002) reminds us of similar expressions
of Isaiah, as in [Isa 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011); [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026); [Isa
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011), etc.; but this similarity
offers no foundation for the doubts of Movers and Hitzig regarding the
genuineness of this verse. The same holds as regards [Jer
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003). The first proposition occurs
frequently in the Psalms, e.g., [Jer
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004); [Jer
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001); [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009), also in [Jer
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#027); [Jer
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014); but קתא with אל is unusual in
Isaiah. The words בּצרות לא are certainly an imitation of נצרות ולא
ידעתּם, [Isa 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#006); but they are
modified, in the manner peculiar to Jeremiah, by the change of נצרות
into בצרות. The combination גּדלות וּבצרות noit is elsewhere used only
of the strong cities of the Canaanites, [Deu
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#028); [Deu
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001); [Jos
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012), cf. [Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028); here בּצרות is transferred to
things which lie beyond the limits of human power to discover, and
become known to men only through divine revelation. There is no good
reason for Ewald's change of בצרות in accordance with [Isa
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#006). - On the contents of these
verses Hengstenberg remarks: "It may seem strange that, though in the
opening part the prophet is promised a revelation of greater, unknown
things, for which he is to call on God, yet the succeeding announcement
contains scarcely anything remarkable or peculiar." Graf also adds the
remark of Hitzig, that the command to pray, addressed to Jeremiah,
cannot have the effect of keeping us from the conclusion that the verses
are an addition by a later hand. Ngelsbach replies that the mode of
expression presents nothing specially unlike Jeremiah, and that what is
most calculated to give the impression of being unlike Jeremiah's,
namely, this introduction in itself, and especially the peculiar turn of
[Jer 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003), "Call unto me," etc., is
occasioned by the prayer of the prophet, [Jer
32:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#016). To this prayer the prophet
had received an answer, [Jer 32:36-44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#036);
but he is here admonished to approach the Lord more frequently with such
a request. The God who has the power to execute as well as make decrees
is quite prepared to give him an insight into His great thoughts
regarding the future; and of this a proof is at once given. Thus, [Jer
33:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001) must be viewed as the
connecting link between Jer 32; 33.

Yet these remarks are not sufficient to silence the objections set forth
against the genuineness of [Jer 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002),
[Jer 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003); for the specializing title
of our chapter, in [Jer 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001), is
opposed to the close connection which Ngelsbach maintains between Jer
32; 33. The fact that, in Jer 32, Jeremiah addresses the Lord in prayer
for further revelation regarding the purchase of the field, as
commanded, and that he receives the information he desired regarding it,
gives no occasion for warning to the prophet, to betake himself more
frequently to God for disclosures regarding His purposes of salvation.
And Ngelsbach has quite evaded the objection that Jeremiah does not obey
the injunction. Moreover, the succeeding revelation made in vv. 4-26 is
not of the nature of a "proof," for it does not contain a single great
leading feature in God's purposes as regards the future. - Hengstenberg
also points out the difficulty, "that the Scripture everywhere refuses
to recognise a dead knowledge as true knowledge, and that the hope of
restoration has an obstacle in the natural man, who strives to obscure
and to extinguish it; that, consequently, the promise of restoration is
always new, and the word of God always great and grand;" but what he
adduces for the solution of the difficulty contained in the command,
"Call on me, and I will show thee great and unknown things," is
insufficient for his purpose. The objection which expositors have taken
to these verses has arisen from an improper application of them; the
words קרא אלי have been understood as referring to the request that God
should give some revelation regarding the future, or His purposes of
deliverance, and ענה as referring to the communication of His purposes
for increasing our knowledge of them. But "to call on God" rather
signifies to pray to God, i.e., to beseech Him for protection, or help,
or deliverance in time of need, cf. [Psa
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005); [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001); [Psa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#009); [Psa
55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017), etc.; and to "answer" is the
reply of God made when He actually vouchsafes the aid sought for; cf.
e.g., [Psa 55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017), "I call on God, and
Jahveh answers me (saves me);" [Psa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002), [Psa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004); [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007); [Psa
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007), etc. Consequently, also, "to
make known" (הגּיד) is no mere communication of knowledge regarding
great and unknown things, no mere letting them be known, but a making
known by deeds. The words עשׂהּ and יוצר אותהּ, ascribed to the Lord,
suggest and require that the words should be thus understood. With the
incorrect reference of these words to knowing and making known there is
connected the further error, that the command, "Call unto me," is
directed to the person of the prophet, and gives an admonition for his
behaviour towards God, for which the text affords on foundation
whatever; for it does not run: "Thus saith Jahveh to me" (אלי), and the
insertion of this אלי is unwarranted, and inconsistent with the use of
כּי which introduces the announcement. Hitzig, Graf, and others have
passed by this כּי without remark; and what Ngelsbach says about it is
connected with his view, already refuted, as to the essential unity of
Jer 32; 33. Lastly, Ewald has enclosed [Jer
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003) within parentheses, and considers
that the introductory formula of [Jer
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002) is resumed in [Jer
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004) : "Yea, thus saith Jahveh." This
is a conclusion hastily formed by one who is in difficulty, for [Jer
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003) has not the nature of a
parenthesis. If we allow the arbitrary addition "to me" after the words,
"Thus saith the Lord," [Jer 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002), and
if we take the words in their simplest sense - the invocation of the
Lord as a call to God for help in need - then [Jer
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002), [Jer
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003) do not contain a mere prelude to
the revelation which follows, but an exhortation to the people to betake
themselves to the Lord their God in their calamity, when He will make
known to them things unattainable by human discernment; for (כּי, [Jer
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004)) He announces, in reference to
the ruined houses of the city, that He will repair their injuries.

[Jeremiah 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 33:4</span></span>

Repair of the injuries and renewal of the prosperity of Jerusalem and
Judah. - [Jer 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004). "For thus saith
Jahveh, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and
concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down
because of the besiegers' mounds and because of the sword, [Jer
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005). While they come to fight with
the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of men, whom I have
slain in my wrath and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have
hidden my face from this city: [Jer
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006). Behold, I will apply a bandage
to it and a remedy, and will heal them, and will reveal to them
abundance of peace and truth. [Jer
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007). And I will turn again the
captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel, and will build them up
as at the first. [Jer 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008). And I will
purify them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against
me, and will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned and
have transgressed against me. [Jer
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009). And it (the city) shall become
to me a name of joy, a praise, and an honour among all the people of the
earth that shall hear all the good which I do them, and shall tremble
and quake because of all the good and because of all the prosperity that
I show to it. [Jer 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010). Thus saith
Jahveh: Again shall there be heard in this place-of which ye say, 'It is
desolate, without man and without beast,'-in the cities of Judah, and in
the streets of Jerusalem, which are laid waste, without men, and without
inhabitants, and without beasts, [Jer
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011). The voice of gladness and the
voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride,
the voice of those who say, 'Praise Jahveh of hosts, for Jahveh is good,
for His mercy is for ever,' who bring thank-offerings into the house of
Jahveh. For I will turn again the captivity of the land, as in the
beginning, saith Jahveh. [Jer 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#012).
Thus saith Jahveh of hosts: In this place, which is laid waste, without
man and beast, and in all its cities, there will yet be pasture-ground
for shepherds making their flocks lie down in. [Jer
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#013). In the cities of the
hill-country, in the cities of the plain, and in the cities of the
south, in the land of Benjamin, and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in
the cities of Judah, the flock shall yet pass under the hand of one who
counts them, saith Jahveh."

With [Jer 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004) begins the statement
concerning the great and incomprehensible things which the Lord will
make known to His people; it is introduced by כּי, which marks the
ground or reason - so far as the mere statement of these things gives
reason for the promise of them. The word of the Lord does not follow
till [Jer 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006) and onwards. In [Jer
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004) and [Jer
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005) are mentioned those whom the word
concerns - the houses of Jerusalem ([Jer
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004)), and the people that defend the
city ([Jer 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005)). Corresponding to
this order, there comes first the promise to the city ([Jer
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006)), and then to the people. Along
with the houses of the city are specially named also the houses of the
kings of Judah; not, perhaps, as Hitzig thinks, because these, being
built of stone, afforded a more suitable material for the declared
object - for that these alone were built of stone is an unfounded
supposition - but in order to show that no house or palace is spared to
defend the city. "Which are broken down" refers to the houses, not only
of the kings, but also of the city. They are broken, pulled down,
according to [Isa 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#010), in order to
fortify the walls of the city against the attacks of the enemy, partly
to strengthen them, partly to repair the damage caused by the
battering-rams directed against them. This gives the following meaning
to the expression אל־הסּללות ואל־החרב: in order to work against the
mounds, i.e., the earthworks erected by the enemy, and against the
sword. The sword is named as being the chief weapon, instead of all the
instruments of war which the enemy employs for reducing the city; cf.
[Eze 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#009). It is against the laws of
grammar to understand נתשׁים as referring to the destruction of the
enemy by the siege material; for, on such a supposition, אל־ would
require to designate the efficient cause, i.e., to stand for מפּני (cf.
[Jer 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#026)), but neither אל־ nor על can
mean this. - The first half of [Jer
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005) is difficult, especially בּאים,
which the lxx have omitted, and which Movers and Hitzig would expunge,
with the absurd remark, that it has come here from [Jer
31:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038); this is an easy and frivolous
method of setting aside difficulties. All other ancient translations
have read בּאים, and have attempted to point out how its genuineness is
ascertained on critical grounds.

(Note: The different attempts to solve the difficulty by conjectures are
of such a nature as scarcely to deserve mention. Ewald would change החרב
בּאים into החרבים otni , "that are broken down opposite the earthworks
and the cannons." But the plural of חרב is חרבות, [Eze
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#021), and cannot possibly mean
cannons. E. Meier would read החריב בּאים, "and for the destruction of
those who are pressing in." Then בּאים must be the enemy who are
pressing in; but how does this agree with what follows, "in order to
fight with the Chaldeans"? Lastly, Ngelsbach would change את־
הכּשׂדּיםinto על־ירוּשׁלים, to obtain the idea that the earthworks and
the sword come for the purpose of contending against Jerusalem (!).)

To connect בּאים closely with what precedes is impossible; and to
understand it as referring to the houses, quae dirutae adhibentur ad
dimicandum cum Chaldaeis (C. B. Michaelis), is incompatible with the
idea contained in בּוא. Still more inadmissible is the view of L. de
Dieu, Venema, Schnurrer, Dahler, and Rosenmller: venientibus ad
oppugnandum cum Chaldaeis; according to this view, אּת־כּשׂדּים must be
the nominative or subject to להלּחם את־הכּשׂדּים בּאים can only signify,
"to contend with the Chaldeans" (against them); cf. [Jer
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005). According to this view, only the
Jews can be the subject of בּאים. "They come to make war with the
Chaldeans, and to fill them (the houses) with the dead bodies of men,
whom I (the Lord) slay in my wrath." The subject is not named, since it
is evident from the whole scope of the sentence what is meant. We take
the verse as a predication regarding the issues of the conflict - but
without a copula; or, as a statement added parenthetically, so that the
participle may be rendered, "while they come," or, "get ready, to
fight." בּוא, used of the approach of an enemy (cf. [Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001)), is here employed with regard to
the advance of the Jews to battle against the besiegers of the city. The
second infinitival clause, "to fill them," represents the issue of the
struggle as contemplated by the Jews, in order to express most strongly
its utter fruitlessness; while the relative clauses, "whom I have
slain," etc., bring out the reasons for the evil consequences.
Substantially, the statement in [Jer
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005) is parallel to that in [Jer
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004), so that we might supply the
preposition על (ועל): "and concerning those who come to fight," etc.
Through the attachment of this second predication to the first by means
of the participle, the expression has become obscured. In the last
clause, אשׁר is to be connected with על־רעתם.

In view of the destruction of Jerusalem now beginning, the Lord
promises, [Jer 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006), "I will apply to
it (the city) a bandage (see [Jer
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#017)) and a remedy," i.e., a bandage
which brings healing, "and heal them" (the inhabitants); for, although
the suffix in רפאתים might be referred to the houses, yet the following
clause shows that it points to the inhabitants. Hitzig takes גּלּיתי in
the meaning of גּלל, "I roll to them like a stream," and appeals to [Amo
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024); [Isa
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018); [Isa
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012), where the fulness of prosperity
is compared to a stream, and the waves of the sea; but this use of גּלה
is as uncertain here as in [Jer 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020).
We keep, then, to the well-established sense of revealing, making known
(cf. [Psa 98:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#002), where it is parallel
with הודיע), without any reference to the figure of sealed
treasure-chambers ([Deu 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#012)), but
with the accessory notion of the unfolding of the prosperity before all
nations ([Jer 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009)), as in [Psa
98:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#002). עתרת is here to be taken as a
noun, "fulness, wealth," from עתר, an Aramaizing form for עשׁר, to be
rich ([Eze 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#013)). שׁלום ואמת does not
mean "prosperity and stability," but "peace and truth;" but this is not
to be toned down to "true peace," i.e., real, enduring happiness
(Ngelsbach). אמת is the truth of God, i.e., His faithfulness in His
promises and covenants, as in [Psa
85:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#011), where mercy and truth,
righteousness and peace, are specified as the gracious benefits with
which the Lord blesses His people.

[Jeremiah 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 33:7</span></span>

The attainment of this prosperity consists in the change of the
wretchedness and misery of Judah and Israel (the whole covenant people)
into permanent happiness, and their being built up - i.e., the firm
establishment of their civil prosperity through the secure possession
and enjoyment of the good things of the land - as in the beginning,
i.e., the time previous to the rending of the state through the falling
away of the people into idolatry; cf. [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026); [Kg1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#006). For השׁיב את see [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044).

[Jeremiah 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 33:8</span></span>

This prosperity gains stability and permanence through the people's
being cleansed from their sins by their being forgiven, which, according
to [Jer 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034), will form the basis of
the new covenant. Regarding the anomalous form לכול for לכל־ rof לכול
mro, Hitzig supposes that in the scriptio continua a transcriber wished
to keep the two datives לך לעונותיהם separate by inserting the ו. But
the form כּוּלּם, [Jer 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034), is
equally irregular, except that there the insertion of the ו may be
explained in this, or in some similar way.

[Jeremiah 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 33:9</span></span>

In consequence of the renovation of Israel externally and internally,
Jerusalem will become to the Lord a name of delight, i.e., a name which
affords joy, delight. שׁם here signifies, not fame, but a name. But the
name, as always in Scripture, is the expression of the essential nature;
the meaning therefore is, "she will develope into a city over which men
will rejoice, whenever her name is mentioned." On the following words,
"for praise and for glory," i.e., for a subject of praise, etc., cf.
[Jer 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011). לכל־גּויי, "to all," or
"among all nations." How far Jerusalem becomes such is shown by the
succeeding clauses: "who shall hear...and tremble and quake because of
the good," i.e., not from fear "because they are seized with terror
through these proofs of the wonderful power of God in contrast with the
helplessness of their idols, and through the feeling of their miserable
and destitute condition as contrasted with the happiness and prosperity
of the people of Israel" (Graf). Against this usual view of the words,
it has already been remarked in the Berleburger Bible, that it does not
agree with what precedes, viz., with the statement that Jerusalem shall
become a name of joy to all nations. Moreover, פּחד and רגז, in the
sense of fear and terror, are construed with מפּני or מן; here, they
signify to shake and tremble for joy, like פּחד in [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005), cf. [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005), i.e., as it is expressed in the
Berleburger Bible, "not with a slavish fear, but with the filial fear of
penitents, which will also draw and drive them to the reconciled God in
Christ, with holy fear and trembling." Calvin had previously recognised
this Messianic idea, and fitly elucidated the words thus: haec duo inter
se conjuncta, nempe pavor et tremor, qui nos humiliet coram Deo, et
fiducia quae nos erigat, ut audeamus familiariter ad ipsum accedere.
אותם may be for אתּם, cf. [Jer 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016);
but probably עשׂה is construed with a double accusative, as in [Isa
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#016).

The prosperity which the Lord designs to procure for His people, is,
[Jer 33:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010), further described in
two strophes ([Jer 33:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010) and [Jer
33:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#012)); in [Jer
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010), [Jer
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011), the joyous life of men. In the
land now laid waste, gladness and joy shall once more prevail, and God
will be praised for this. The description, "it is desolate," etc., does
not imply the burning of Jerusalem, [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012)., but only the desolation which
began about the end of the siege. "In this place" means "in this land;"
this is apparent from the more detailed statement, "in the cities of
Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem." "The voice of gladness," etc.,
forms the subject of the verb ישּׁמע. On the expression see [Jer
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034); [Jer
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009); [Jer
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010). There is here added: "the voice
of those who say, 'Praise the Lord,' " etc. - the usual liturgic formula
in thanksgiving to God; cf. [Ch2 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013);
[Ch2 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#003); [Ezr
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011); [Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001). תּודה, praise and thanks in
word and deed; see [Jer 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#026). On
אשׁיב את־שׁבוּת see [Jer 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044). The
rendering, "I shall bring back the captives of the land" (here as in
[Jer 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007)), is both grammatically
indefensible, and further, unsuitable: (a) inappropriate, on account of
כּבראשׁנה, for no previous restoration of captives had taken place; the
leading of the people out of Egypt is never represented as a bringing
back from captivity. And (b) it is grammatically untenable, because
restoration to Canaan is expressed either by אל־הארץ הביא, after [Deu
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#005); or by השׁיב, with the mention of
the place (); cf. [Jer 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015); [Jer
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006); [Jer
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037), etc.

[Jeremiah 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 33:12</span></span>

In the land which is now laid waste, and emptied of men and beasts,
shepherds, with their flocks, shall again move about and lie down. "This
place," is specified by the mention of the several parts of the land, as
in [Jer 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044); [Jer
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#026). על־ידי מונה, at the hands,
i.e., under the guidance, of him who counts them, viz., the shepherd,
who counted the sheep when he took them out to the pasture as well as
when he brought them back into the fold; cf. Virgil, Ecl. iii. 34.

[Jeremiah 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 33:14</span></span>

The re-establishment of the Davidic monarchy and of the Levitical
priesthood. - [Jer 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014). "Behold,
days are coming, saith Jahveh, when I will perform the good word which I
have spoken to the house of Israel, and concerning the house of Judah.
[Jer 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015). In those days and at that
time will I cause to sprout unto David a sprout of righteousness, and he
shall do judgment and righteousness in the land. [Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016). In those days shall Judah be
saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is how she shall be
called, 'Jahveh our righteousness.' [Jer
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017). For thus saith Jahveh: David
shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel.
[Jer 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#018). Nor shall the Levitical
priests want a man before me to offer a burnt-offering, to burn a
meat-offering, or to perform sacrifice every day.

[Jer 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#019). "And the word of Jahveh
came unto Jeremiah, saying: [Jer
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020). Thus saith Jahveh, If ye shall
be able to break my covenant (with) the day and my covenant (with) the
night, so that there shall not be day and night in their proper time,
[Jer 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#021). Then also shall my
covenant with David my servant be broken, so that he shall not have a
son to reign upon his throne, and with the Levites, the priests, my
ministers. [Jer 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#022). As the host of
heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so will I
multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites who serve me.

[Jer 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#023). "And the word of Jahveh
came to Jeremiah, saying: [Jer 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#024).
Hast thou not seen what this people have spoken, saying, 'The two
families which the Lord hath chosen, these He hath rejected?' and my
people they have despised, so that they are no longer a nation before
them. [Jer 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025). Thus saith Jahveh:
If my covenant with day and night doth not exist, if I have not
appointed the laws of heaven and earth, [Jer
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#026). Then also will I reject the
seed of Jacob and David my servant, so as not to take any of his seed as
rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will turn their
captivity, and take pity on them."

[Jer 33:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014)

[Jer 33:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014) contain the promise of
the restoration of the monarchy and the priesthood. [Jer
33:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#019) further present two special
messages from God, in the form of supplements, which guarantee the
eternal continuance of these institutions.

(Note: The portion contained within [Jer
33:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014) is wanting in the lxx; for
this reason, and chiefly because of the promise of the eternal duration,
not merely of the royal house of David, but also of the Levitical
priests, and their innumerable increase, J. D. Michaelis and Jahn have
considered it spurious. To these must be added Movers, who takes [Jer
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#018), [Jer
33:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#021) as later interpolations, and
Hitzig, who treats the whole passage as a series of separate additions
made in a later age. On the other side, Kueper, Wichelhaus, and
Hengstenberg (Christology, vol. ii. pp. 459-461 of Clark's Translation)
have shown the utter worthlessness of these reasons, and Graf also has
defended the genuineness of the passage. So too has Ewald, who says
(Propheten, ii. 269), "Nothing can be so preposterous and unreasonable
as to find in this passage, [Jer
33:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#019), or in Jer 30-33 generally,
additions by a later prophet.")

The promise in [Jer 33:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014) has
already been given in substance in [Jer
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005), and in our verses it is only
formally extended, and thereby made more prominent. In [Jer
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014) it is designated as the
establishment, i.e., the realization, of the good word which the Lord
has spoken concerning Israel and Judah. "The good word" is, according to
[Deu 28:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001), the blessing which the
Lord has promised to His people if they obey His commands; cf. [Kg1
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#056). Here also must "the good word"
be taken in the same general meaning; for our verse forms the transition
from the promise of the restoration and blessing of Israel in the future
([Jer 33:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006)) to the special promise
of the renewal and completion of the Davidic monarchy ([Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015).). In [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010), on the contrary, "the good
word" is specially referred, by the following infinitival clause, to the
deliverance of the people from Babylon. But it is unlikely that "the
good word" refers to the "sprout" of David, which is expressly promised
in [Jer 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)., and repeated here, [Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015).; for here a like promise to the
Levites follows, while there is none in Jer 23, and it is here so
closely linked with the promise regarding David, that it must be viewed
as a portion of the "good word." In the change from אל to על in [Jer
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014), we must not, with Hengstenberg,
seek a real difference; for in Jeremiah these prepositions often
interchange without any difference of meaning, as in [Jer
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002); [Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011); [Jer
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#035), etc. The blessing promised to
the people in the "good word" culminates in the promise, [Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015)., that the Lord will cause a
righteous sprout to spring up for David. On the meaning of this promise,
see the remarks on [Jer 23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005). The
difference made in the repetition of that promise is really unimportant.
אצמיח instead of הקמתי does not change the sense. הצמיח, to cause to
sprout of grow, corresponds to the figure of the צמח, under which the
Messiah is represented in both passages. צמח צדקה is only a more
sonorous expression for צמח צדּיק. The words "He shall rule as king and
deal wisely," which in [Jer 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005) bring
into prominence the contrast between the kingdom of the Messiah and that
of the godless shepherd of the people, were unnecessary for the
connection of our passage. Besides, in [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006) Israel is named together with
Judah, instead of which, we have here, in [Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016), Jerusalem; accordingly, the
name "Jahveh Tsidkenu" is referred to Jerusalem, while in [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006) it is predicated of the sprout of
David. The mention of Jerusalem instead of Israel is connected with the
general scope of our prophecy, viz., to comfort the covenant people over
the destruction of Jerusalem ([Jer
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004).). But that, through the mention
simply of Judah and its capital, the ten tribes are not to be excluded
from participation in the coming prosperity, may be seen even from [Jer
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014), where "the good word" is
referred to Israel and Judah, and still more plainly from [Jer
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#024), [Jer
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#026), where this promise is made sure
to the whole seed of Israel. The transference of the name Jahveh
Tsidkenu from the sprout of David to the city of Jerusalem is connected
with the fact, that the name only expresses what the Messiah will bring
to the people (see [Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)); the
righteousness which He works in and on Jerusalem may, without changing
the substance of the thought, be attributed to Jerusalem itself,
inasmuch as Jerusalem reflects the righteousness which is bestowed on
her by the Messiah.

This promise is, [Jer 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017), further
confirmed by the renewal of that which the Lord had given King David,
through Nathan the prophet, [Sa2
7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012), and that, too, in the form in
which David himself had expressed it in his address to Solomon, shortly
before his death, [Kg1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004), and in
which Solomon had repeated it, [Kg1
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025) and [Kg1
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#005). The formula לא יכּרת וגו, "there
never will be cut off from David one sitting," etc., has the meaning,
David will never want a descendant to occupy his throne; or, the
posterity of David will possess the kingdom for ever. A temporary loss
of the throne is not thereby excluded, but only such a permanent loss as
would be caused by the family of David becoming extinct, or by the
kingdom in Israel either passing over to some other family, or in some
way or other coming to an end; see on [Kg1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004). - The very same promise is given
to the Levitical priests, i.e., the priests of the tribe or family of
Levi (כּהנים as in [Deu 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009), [Deu
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#018); [Deu
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001), etc.). They shall never want one
to bring and prepare an offering before the Lord. Burnt-offering,
meat-offering, and sin-offering are the three species of sacrifice which
were to be brought, according to the law, as in [Jer
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#026). By means of the apposition "the
Levites," the priests are designated as the legitimate priesthood,
established as such in virtue of God's choice of the tribe of Levi, in
contrast with priests such as Jeroboam appointed, out of the common
people, for the worship set up by him. Not only shall Israel have
priests, but priests out of the tribe of Levi, which was chosen by God
for the sacerdotal office, as the medium of communicating His gracious
gifts. The designation of the priests as "the Levites" corresponds,
accordingly, to the kings of the family of David. Such a view explains
this addition to our passage, to which critics such as Hitzig have taken
objection. The Davidic kingdom and the Levitical priesthood were the two
pillars and bases of the Old Testament theocracy, on which its existence
and continuance depended. The priesthood formed the medium of approach
for the people into divine favour. The kingdom assured them of the
divine guidance.

(Note: Continebatur autem salus populi duabus istis partibus. Nam, sine
rege, erant veluti corpus truncum aut mutilum; sine sacerdote mera erat
dissipatio. Nam sacerdos erat quasi medius inter Deum et populum, rex
autem representabat Dei personam. - Calvin.)

Both of these pillars were broken with the destruction of Jerusalem and
of the temple; the theocracy the appeared to have ceased to exist. At
this time, when the kingdom, with its ordinances of justice and of
grace, bestowed by God, was being dissolved, the Lord, in order to keep
His people from despair, declares that these two institutions, in
accordance with His promise, shall not fall to the ground, but shall
stand for ever. By this, God's own people received a pledge for the
re-establishment and renovation of the kingdom of God. Such is the
object of this promise. - As to the kind and mode of reinstitution of
both of these ordinances, which were abolished when the state came to
ruin, the prophecy now before us gives no explanation; but in the
emphatic confirmation of the prophecy which follows, we find brief
indications which clearly show that the restoration spoken of will not
be a reinstitution of the old form which is now perishing, but a
renovation of it, in its essential features, to a permanent existence.

The confirmations of these promises, which follow them in [Jer
33:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#019), are each introduced by
separate headings, perhaps not merely to render them more prominent, but
because the Lord revealed them separately to the prophet; but it by no
means follows from this that they are later additions, without any
connection. [Jer 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020). "If ye shall
break my covenant with the day,...then also will my covenant with
David...be broken." This if betokens the impossible; man cannot alter
the arrangement in nature for the regular alternation of day and night.
היום and הלּילה are in apposition to בּריתי, "my covenant the day - the
night," for "my covenant with regard to the day and the night, which is
this, that day and night shall return at their appointed times." The ו
before לבלתּי is explanatory. יומם־ולילה are adverbs, "day and night,"
for "the regular alternation of day and night." These divine
arrangements in nature are called a covenant; because God, after the
flood, gave a pledge that they should uninterruptedly continue, in a
covenant made with the human race; cf. [Gen
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#009) with [Gen
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022). As this covenant of nature
cannot be broken by men, so also the covenant of grace of the Lord with
David and the Levites cannot be broken, i.e., annulled. The covenant
with David consisted in the promise that his kingdom should endure for
ever (see [Jer 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017)); that with the
Levites, in the eternal possession of the right to the priesthood. The
institution of the priesthood is certainly not represented in the law as
a covenant; it consisted merely in the choice of Aaron and his sons as
priests by God, [Exo 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001). But,
inasmuch as they were thereby brought into a peculiar relation to the
Lord, and thus had vouchsafed to them not merely privileges and
promises, but also had laid on them duties, the fulfilment of which was
a condition of receiving the privileges, this relation might be called a
covenant; and indeed, in [Num 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011).,
the promise given to Phinehas, that he should have the priesthood as an
eternal possession, is called a covenant of peace and an eternal
covenant of priesthood. This promise concerned the whole priesthood in
the person of Phinehas, and the Levites also, inasmuch as the Levites
were given to the priests; hence there is mention made in [Mal
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#004), [Mal
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#008), of a covenant with Levi. In this
prophecy, too, mention is made of the priests alone. The general idea
contained in the words "the Levites," placed first, is more clearly
defined by the apposition "the priests," and restricted to the priests
of the tribe of Levi.

[Jer 33:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#022)

In order to make still more impressive the pledge given, that the
covenant with David and the Levitical priesthood can never be broken,
the Lord adds the promise of a numerous increase of the seed of David
and the Levites. אשׁר as correlative to כּן stands for כּאשׁר; for in
the accusative lies the general reference to place, time, kind, and
manner; cf. Ew. 360 a, 333 a. The comparison with the innumerable host
of stars and the immeasurable quantity of the sand reminds us of the
patriarchal promises, [Gen 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005); [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017). In this way, the promises that
apply to all Israel are specially referred to the family of David and
the Levites ("the Levites," [Jer
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#022), is abbreviated from "the
Levites, the priests," [Jer 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#021)).
This transference, however, is not a mere hyperbole which misses the
mark; for, as Jahn observes, an immense increase of the royal and
priestly families would only have been a burden on the people (Graf).
The import of the words of the verse is simply that the Lord purposes to
fulfil the promise of His blessing, made to the patriarchs in favour of
their whole posterity, in the shape of a numerous increase; but this
promise will now be specially applied to the posterity of David and to
the priests, so that there shall never be wanting descendants of David
to occupy the throne, nor Levites to perform the service of the Lord.
The question is not about a "change of the whole of Israel into the
family of David and the tribe of Levi" (Hengstenberg); and if the
increase of the family of David and the Levites correspond in multitude
with the number of all the people of Israel, this increase cannot be a
burden on the people. But the question, whether this promise is to be
understood literally, of the increase of the ordinary descendants of
David and the Levites, or spiritually, of their spiritual posterity,
cannot be decided, as Hengstenberg and Ngelsbach think, by referring to
the words of the Lord in [Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006),
that all Israel shall be a kingdom of priests, and to the prophetic
passages, [Isa 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#006), [Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023)., according to which the whole
people shall be priests to God, while Levites also shall be taken from
among the heathen. For this prophecy does not treat of the final glory
of the people of God, but only of the innumerable increase of those who
shall attain membership in the family of David and the Levitical
priests. The question that has been raised is rather to be decided in
accordance with the general promises regarding the increase of Israel;
and in conformity with these, we answer that it will not result from the
countless increase of the descendants of Jacob according to the flesh,
but from the incorporation, among the people of God, of the heathen who
return to the God of Israel. As the God-fearing among the heathen will
be raised, for their piety, to be the children of Abraham, and according
to the promise, [Isa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020)., even
Levitical priests taken from among them, so shall the increase placed in
prospect before the descendants of David and Levi be realized by the
reception of the heathen into the royal and sacerdotal privileges of the
people of God under the new covenant.

This view of our verse is confirmed by the additional proof given of the
promised restoration of Israel, [Jer
33:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#023); for here there is assurance
given to the seed of Jacob and David, and therefore to all Israel, that
they shall be kept as the people of God. The occasion of this renewed
confirmation was the allegation by the people, that the Lord had
rejected the two families, i.e., Israel and Judah (cf. [Jer
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#027), [Jer
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031); [Jer
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#020)), called, [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014), the two houses of Israel. With
such words they despised the people of the Lord, as being no longer a
people before them, i.e., in their eyes, in their opinion. That those
who spoke thus were Jews, who, on the fall of the kingdom of Judah,
despaired of the continuance of God's election of Israel, is so very
evident, that Hengstenberg may well find it difficult to understand how
several modern commentators could think of heathens - Egyptians
(Schnurrer), Chaldeans (Jahn), Samaritans (Movers), or neighbours of the
Jews and of Ezekiel on the Chebar (Hitzig). The verdict pronounced on
what these people said, "they despise, or contemn, my people," at once
relieves us from any need for making such assumptions, as soon as we
assign the full and proper force to the expression "my people" = the
people of Jahveh. Just as in this passage, so too in [Jer
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032), "this people" is interchanged
with "my people" as a designation of the Jews. Moreover, as Graf
correctly says, the expression "this people" nowhere occurs in the
prophets of the exile as applied to the heathen; on the contrary, it is
very frequently employed by Jeremiah to designate the people of Judah in
their estrangement from the Lord: [Jer
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010); [Jer
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014), [Jer
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#023); [Jer
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#019); [Jer
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033); [Jer
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#005); [Jer
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#014); [Jer
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#010); [Jer
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#010); [Jer
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001), [Jer
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020), and often elsewhere. "My
people," on the other hand, marks Judah and Israel as the people of God.
In contrast with such contempt of the people of God, the Lord announces,
"If my covenant with day and night does not stand, if I have not
appointed the laws of heaven and earth, then neither shall I cast away
the seed of Jacob." The לא is repeated a second time before the verb.
Others take the two antecedent clauses as one: "If I have not made my
covenant with day and night, the laws of heaven and earth." This
construction also is possible; the sense remains unchanged. בּריתי יומם
ולילה is imitated from [Jer 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020).
"The laws of heaven and earth" are the whole order of nature; cf. [Jer
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035). The establishment, institution
of the order of nature, is a work of divine omnipotence. This
omnipotence has founded the covenant of grace with Israel, and pledged
its continuance, despite the present destruction of the kingdom of Judah
and the temporary rejection of the guilty people. But this covenant of
grace includes not merely the choosing of David, but also the choosing
of the seed of Jacob, the people of Israel, on the ground of which David
was chosen to be the ruler over Israel. Israel will therefore continue
to exist, and that, too, as a nation which will have rulers out of the
seed of David, the servant of the Lord. "The mention of the three
patriarchs recalls to mind the whole series of the promises made to
them" (Hengstenberg). The plural משׁלים does not, certainly, refer
directly to the promise made regarding the sprout of David, the Messiah,
but at the same time does not stand in contradiction with it; for the
revival and continued existence of the Davidic rule in Israel culminates
in the Messiah. On כּי cf. [Jer 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#023);
[Jer 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#003), [Jer
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018), and the explanations on [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044). The Qeri אשׁיב rests on [Jer
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011), but is unnecessary; for אשׁוּב
makes good enough sense, and corresponds better to ורחמתּים, in so far
as it exactly follows the fundamental passage, [Deu
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003), where רחם is joined with שׁוּב
את־שׁבוּת.
