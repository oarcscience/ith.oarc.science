The Prophecies of Isaiah

Introduction

Time of the Prophet

The first prerequisite to a clear understanding and full appreciation of
the prophecies of Isaiah, is a knowledge of his time, and of the
different periods of his ministry. The first period was in the reigns of
Uzziah (b.c. 811-759) and Jotham (759-743). The precise starting-point
depends upon the view we take of [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md). But, in any case, Isaiah
commenced his ministry towards the close of Uzziah's reign, and laboured
on throughout the sixteen years of the reign of Jotham. The first
twenty-seven of the fifty-two years that Uzziah reigned run parallel to
the last twenty-seven of the forty-one that Jeroboam II reigned (b.c.
825-784). Under Joash, and his son Jeroboam II, the kingdom of Israel
passed through a period of outward glory, which surpassed, both in
character and duration, any that it had reached before; and this was
also the case with the kingdom of Judah under Uzziah and his son Jotham.
As the glory of the one kingdom faded away, that of the other increased.
The bloom of the northern kingdom was destroyed and surpassed by that of
the southern. But outward splendour contained within itself the fatal
germ of decay and ruin in the one case as much as in the other; for
prosperity degenerated into luxury, and the worship of Jehovah became
stiffened into idolatry. It was in this last and longest time of Judah's
prosperity that Isaiah arose, with the mournful vocation to preach
repentance without success, and consequently to have to announce the
judgment of hardening and devastation, of the ban and of banishment. The
second period of his ministry extended from the commencement of the
reign of Ahaz to that of the reign of Hezekiah. Within these sixteen
years three events occurred, which combined to bring about a new and
calamitous turn in the history of Judah. In the place of the worship of
Jehovah, which had been maintained with outward regularity and legal
precision under Uzziah and Jotham; as soon as Ahaz ascended the throne,
open idolatry was introduced of the most abominable description and in
very various forms. The hostilities which began while Jotham was living,
were perpetuated by Pekah the king of Israel and Rezin the king of
Damascene Syria; and in the Syro-Ephraimitish war, an attack was made
upon Jerusalem, with the avowed intention of bringing the Davidic rule
to an end. Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria, to
help him out of these troubles. He thus made flesh his arm, and so
entangled the nation of Jehovah with the kingdom of the world, that from
that time forward it never truly recovered its independence again. The
kingdom of the world was the heathen state in its Nimrodic form. Its
perpetual aim was to extend its boundaries by constant accretions, till
it had grown into a world-embracing colossus; and in order to accomplish
this, it was ever passing beyond its natural boundaries, and coming down
like an avalanche upon foreign nations, not merely for self-defence or
revenge, but for the purpose of conquest also. Assyria and Rome were the
first and last links in that chain of oppression by the kingdom of the
world, which ran through the history of Israel. Thus Isaiah, standing as
he did on the very threshold of this new and all-important turn in the
history of his country, and surveying it with his telescopic glance,
was, so to speak, the universal prophet of Israel. The third period of
his ministry extended from the accession of Hezekiah to the fifteenth
year of his reign. Under Hezekiah the nation rose, almost at the same
pace at which it had previously declined under Ahaz. He forsook the ways
of his idolatrous father, and restored the worship of Jehovah. The mass
of the people, indeed, remained inwardly unchanged, but Judah had once
more an upright king, who hearkened to the word of the prophet by his
side - two pillars of the state, and men mighty in prayer ([Ch2
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#020).md). When the attempt was
afterwards made to break away from the Assyrian yoke, so far as the
leading men and the great mass of the people were concerned, this was an
act of unbelief originating merely in the same confident expectation of
help from Egypt which had occasioned the destruction of the northern
kingdom in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign; but on the part of
Hezekiah it was an act of faith and confident reliance upon Jehovah
([Kg2 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#007).md). Consequently, when
Sennacherib, the successor of Shalmaneser, marched against Jerusalem,
conquering and devastating the land as he advanced, and Egypt failed to
send the promised help, the carnal defiance of the leaders and of the
great mass of the people brought its own punishment. But Jehovah averted
the worst extremity, by destroying the kernel of the Assyrian army in a
single night; so that, as in the Syro-Ephraimitish war, Jerusalem itself
was never actually besieged. Thus the faith of the king, and of the
better portion of the nation, which rested upon the word of promise, had
its reward. There was still a divine power in the state, which preserved
it from destruction. The coming judgment, which nothing indeed could now
avert, according to [Isa 6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md), was
arrested for a time, just when the last destructive blow would naturally
have been expected. It was in this miraculous rescue, which Isaiah
predicted, and for which he prepared the way, that the public ministry
of the prophet culminated. Isaiah was the Amos of the kingdom of Judah,
having the same fearful vocation to foresee and to declare the fact,
that for Israel as a people and kingdom the time of forgiveness had gone
by. But he was not also the Hosea of the southern kingdom; for it was
not Isaiah, but Jeremiah, who received the solemn call to accompany the
disastrous fate of the kingdom of Judah with the knell of prophetic
denunciations. Jeremiah was the Hosea of the kingdom of Judah. To Isaiah
was given the commission, which was refused to his successor Jeremiah -
namely, to press back once more, through the might of his prophetic
word, coming as it did out of the depths of the strong spirit of faith,
the dark night which threatened to swallow up his people at the time of
the Assyrian judgment. After the fifteenth year of Hezekiah's reign, he
took no further part in public affairs; but he lived till the
commencement of Manasseh's reign, when, according to a credible
tradition, to which there is an evident allusion in [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037) ("they were sawn asunder".md),

(Note: According to b. Jebamoth, 49b, it was found in a roll containing
the history of a Jerusalem family; and according to Sanhedrin, 103b, in
the Targum on [Kg2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016)..md)

he fell a victim to the heathenism which became once more supreme in the
land. To this sketch of the times and ministry of the prophet we will
add a review of the scriptural account of the four kings, under whom he
laboured according to [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md); since
nothing is more essential, as a preparation for the study of his book,
than a minute acquaintance with these sections of the books of Kings and
Chronicles.

I. Historical Account of Uzziah-Jotham - The account of Uzziah given in
the book of Kings ([Kg2 15:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md), to
which we may add [Kg2 14:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021).md), like
that of Jeroboam II, is not so full as we should have expected. After
the murder of Amaziah, the people of Judah, as related in [Isa
14:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#021.md), raised to the throne his son
Azariah, probably not his first-born, who was then sixteen years old. It
was he who built the Edomitish seaport town of Elath (for navigation and
commerce), and made it a permanent possession of Judah (as in the time
of Solomon). This notice is introduced, as a kind of appendix, at the
close of Amaziah's life and quite out of its chronological position,
because the conquest of Elath was the crowning point of the subjugation
of Edom by Amaziah, and not, as Thenius supposes, because it was
Azariah's first feat of arms, by which, immediately after his accession,
he satisfied the expectations with which the army had made him king. For
the victories gained by this king over Edom and the other neighbouring
nations cannot have been obtained at the time when Amos prophesied,
which was about the tenth year of Uzziah's reign. The attack made by
Amaziah upon the kingdom of Israel, had brought the kingdom of Judah
into a state of dependence upon the former, and almost of total ruin,
from which it only recovered gradually, like a house that had fallen
into decay. The chronicler, following the text of the book of Kings, has
introduced the notice concerning Elath in the same place ([Ch2
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md), [Ch2
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#002.md) : it is written Eloth, as in [Kg1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026.md), and the Septuagint at [Kg2
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022).md). He calls the king Uzziahu; and
it is only in the table of the kings of Judah, in [Ch1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#012.md), that he gives the name as
Azariah. The author of the book of Kings, according to our Hebrew text,
calls him sometimes Azariah or Azariahu, sometimes Uzziah or Uzziahu;
the Septuagint always gives the name as Azarias. The occurrence of the
two names in both of the historical books is an indubitable proof that
they are genuine. Azariah was the original name: out of this Uzziah was
gradually formed by a significant elision; and as the prophetical books,
from [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md) to [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md), clearly show, the latter was the
name most commonly used.

Azariah, as we learn from the section in the book of Kings relating to
the reign of this monarch ([Kg2
15:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001).md), ascended the throne in the
twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam's reign, that is to say, in the
fifteenth year of his sole government, the twenty-seventh from the time
when he shared the government with his father Joash, as we may gather
from [Kg2 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#013.md). The youthful
sovereign, who was only sixteen years of age, was the son of Amaziah by
a native of Jerusalem, and reigned fifty-two years. He did what was
pleasing in the sight of God, like his father Amaziah; i.e., although he
did not come up to the standard of David, he was one of the better
kings. He fostered the worship of Jehovah, as prescribed in the law:
nevertheless he left the high places (bamoth) standing; and while he was
reigning, the people maintained in all its force the custom of
sacrificing and burning incense upon the heights. He was punished by God
with leprosy, which compelled him to live in a sick-house (chophshuth =
chophshith: sickness) till the day of his death, whilst his son Jotham
was over the palace, and conducted the affairs of government. He was
buried in the city of David, and Jotham followed by him on the throne.
This is all that the author of the book of Kings tells us concerning
Azariah: for the rest, he refers to the annals of the kings of Judah.
The section in the Chronicles relating to Uzziah (2 Chron 26) is much
more copious: the writer had our book of Kings before him, as [Ch2
26:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#003.md), [Ch2
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021.md), clearly proves, and completed
the defective notices from the source which he chiefly employed -
namely, the much more elaborate midrash.

Uzziah, he says, was zealous in seeking Elohim in the days of Zechariah,
who had understanding in divine visions; and in the days when he sought
Jehovah, God made him to prosper. Thus the prophet Zechariah, as a
faithful pastor and counsellor, stood in the same relation to him in
which Jehoiada the high priest had stood to Joash, Uzziah's grandfather.
The chronicler then enumerates singly the divine blessings which Uzziah
enjoyed. First, his victories over the surrounding nations (passing over
the victory over Edom, which had been already mentioned), viz.: (1.) he
went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall
of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built towns
b'ashdod and b'phelistim (i.e., in the conquered territory of Ashdod,
and in Philistia generally); (2.) God not only gave him victory over the
Philistines, but also over the Arabians who dwelt in Gur-baal (an
unknown place, which neither the lxx nor the Targumists could explain),
and the Mehunim, probably a tribe of Arabia Petraea; (3.) the Ammonites
gave him presents in token of allegiance, and his name was honoured even
as far as Egypt, to such an extent did his power grow. Secondly, his
buildings: he built towers (fortifications) above the corner gate, and
above the valley gate, and above the Mikzoa, and fortified these (the
weakest) portions of Jerusalem: he also built towers in the desert
(probably in the desert between Beersheba and Gaza, to protect either
the land, or the flocks and herds that were pasturing there); and dug
many cisterns, for he had large flocks and herds both in the shephelah
(the western portion of Southern Palestine) and in the mishor (the
extensive pasture-land of the tribe territory of Reuben on the other
side of the Jordan): he had also husbandmen and vine-dressers on the
mountains, and in the fruitful fields, for he was a lover of
agriculture. Thirdly, his well-organized troops: he had an army of
fighting men which consisted - according to a calculation made by Jeiel
the scribe, and Maaseiah, the officer under the superintendence of
Nahaniah, one of the royal princes - of 2600 heads of families, who had
307,500 men under their command, "that made war with mighty power to
help the king against the enemy." Uzziah furnished these, according to
all the divisions of the army, with shields, had spears, and helmet, and
coats of mail, and bows, even with slinging-stones. He also had
ingenious slinging-machines (balistae) made in Jerusalem, to fix upon
the towers and ramparts, for the purpose of shooting arrows and large
stones. His name resounded far abroad, for he had marvellous success, so
that he became very powerful.

Up to this point the chronicler has depicted the brighter side of
Uzziah's reign. His prosperous deeds and enterprises are all grouped
together, so that it is doubtful whether the history within these
several groups follows the chronological order or not. The light thrown
upon the history of the times by the group of victories gained by
Uzziah, would be worth twice as much if the chronological order were
strictly observed. But even if we might assume that the victory over the
Philistines preceded the victory over the Arabians of Gur-baal and the
Mehunim, and this again the subjugation of Ammon, it would still be very
uncertain what position the expedition against Edom - which was noticed
by anticipation at the close of Amaziah's life - occupied in relation to
the other wars, and at what part of Uzziah's reign the several wars
occurred. All that can be affirmed is, that they preceded the closing
years of his life, when the blessing of God was withdrawn from him.

The chronicler relates still further, in [Isa
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md), that as Uzziah became stronger
and stronger, he fell into pride of heart, which led him to perform a
ruinous act. He sinned against Jehovah his God, by forcing his way into
the holy place of the temple, to burn incense upon the altar of incense,
from the proud notion that royalty involved the rights of the
priesthood, and that the priests were only the delegates and
representatives of the king. Then Azariah the high priest, and eighty
other priests, brave men, hurried after him, and went up to him, and
said, "This does not belong to thee, Uzziah, to burn incense of Jehovah;
but to the priests, and sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn
incense: go out of the sanctuary, for thou sinnest; and this is not for
thine honour with Jehovah Elohim!" Then Uzziah was wroth, as he held the
censer in his hand; and while he was so enraged against the priests,
leprosy broke out upon his forehead in the sight of the priests, in the
house of Jehovah, at the altar of incense. When Azariah the high priest
and the rest of the priests turned to him, behold, he was leprous in his
forehead; and they brought him hurriedly away from thence - in fact, he
himself hasted to go out - for Jehovah had smitten him. After having
thus explained the circumstances which led to the king's leprosy, the
chronicler follows once more the text of the book of Kings - where the
leprosy itself is also mentioned - and states that the king remained a
leper until the day of his death, and lived in a sick-house, without
ever being able to visit the temple again. But instead of the statement
in the book of Kings, that he was buried in the city of David, the
chronicler affirms more particularly that he was not placed in the
king's sepulchre; but, inasmuch as he was leprous, and would therefore
have defiled it, was buried in the field near the sepulchre. But before
introducing this conclusion to the history of Uzziah's reign, and
instead of referring to the annals of the kings of Judah, as the author
of the book of Kings has done, or making such citations as we generally
find, the author simply states, that "the rest of the acts of Uzziah,
first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write."

It cannot possibly be either the prophecies of Isaiah of the time of
Uzziah, or a certain historical portion of the original book of Isaiah's
predictions, to which reference is here made; for in that case we should
expect the same notice at the close of the account of Jotham's reign,
or, at any rate, at the close of that of Ahaz (cf., [Ch2
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#007.md) and [Ch2
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#026).md). It is also inconceivable that
Isaiah's book of predictions should have contained either a prophetical
or historical account of the first acts of Uzziah, since Isaiah was
later than Amos, later even than Hosea; and his public ministry did not
commence till the close of his reign-in fact, not till the year of his
death. Consequently the chronicler must refer to some historical work
distinct from "the visions of Isaiah." Just as he mentions two
historical works within the first epoch of the divided kingdom, viz.,
Shemaiah's and Iddo's - the former of which referred more especially to
the entire history of Rehoboam, and the latter to the history of Abijah
- and then again, in the second epoch, an historical work by Jehu ben
Hanani, which contained a complete history of Jehoshaphat from the
beginning to the end; so here, in the third epoch, he speaks of Isaiah
ben Amoz, the greatest Judaean prophet of this epoch as the author of a
special history of Uzziah, which was not incorporated in his "visions"
like the history of Hezekiah (cf., [Ch2
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032).md), but formed an independent
work. Besides this prophetical history of Uzziah, there was also an
annalistic history, as [Kg2 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#006.md)
clearly shows; and it is quite possible that the annals of Uzziah were
finished when Isaiah commenced his work, and that they were made use of
by him. For the leading purpose of the prophetical histories was to
exhibit the inward and divine connection between the several outward
events, which the annals simply registered. The historical writings of a
prophet were only the other side of his more purely prophetic work. In
the light of the Spirit of God, the former looked deep into the past,
the latter into the present. Both of them had to do with the ways of
divine justice and grace, and set forth past and present, alike in view
of the true goal, in which these two ways coincide.

Jotham succeeded Uzziah, after having acted as regent, or rather as
viceroy, for several years ([Kg2
15:32-38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032).md). He ascended the throne in
the second year of Pekah king of Israel, in the twenty-fifth year of his
age, and reigned for sixteen years in a manner which pleased God, though
he still tolerated the worship upon high places, as his father had done.
He built the upper gate of the temple. The author has no sooner written
this than he refers to the annals, simply adding, before concluding with
the usual formula concerning his burial in the city of David, that in
those days, i.e., towards the close of Jotham's reign, the hostilities
of Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Israel commenced, as a judgment from
God upon Judah. The chronicler, however, makes several valuable
additions to the text of the book of Kings, which he has copied word for
word down to the notice concerning the commencement of the
Syro-Ephraimitish hostilities (vid., [Ch2
27:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001).md). We do not include in this the
statement that Jotham did not force his way into the holy place in the
temple: this is simply intended as a limitation of the assertion made by
the author of the book of Kings as to the moral equality of Jotham and
Uzziah, and in favour of the former. The words, "the people continued in
their destructive course," also contain nothing new, but are simply the
shorter expression used in the Chronicles to indicate the continuance of
the worship of the high places during Jotham's reign. But there is
something new in what the chronicler appends to the remark concerning
the building of the upper gate of the temple, which is very bold and
abrupt as it stands in the book of Kings, viz., "On the wall of the
Ophel he built much (i.e., he fortified this southern spur of the temple
hill still more strongly), and put towns in the mountains of Judah, and
erected castles and towers in the forests (for watchtowers and defences
against hostile attacks). He also fought with the king of the Ammonites;
and when conquered, they were obliged to give him that year and the two
following a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and
the same quantity of barley. Jotham grew stronger and stronger, because
he strove to walk before Jehovah his God." The chronicler breaks off
with this general statement, and refers, for the other memorabilia of
Jotham, and all his wars and enterprises, to the book of the Kings of
Israel and Judah.

This is what the two historical books relate concerning the royal pair -
Uzziah-Jotham - under whom the kingdom of Judah enjoyed once more a
period of great prosperity and power - "the greatest since the
disruption, with the exception of that of Jehoshaphat; the longest
during the whole period of its existence, the last before its overthrow"
(Caspari). The sources from which the two historical accounts were
derived were the annals: they were taken directly from them by the
author of the book of Kings, indirectly by the chronicler. No traces can
be discovered of the work written by Isaiah concerning Uzziah, although
it may possibly be employed in the midrash of the chronicler. There is
an important supplement to the account given by the chronicler in the
casual remark made in [Ch1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#017.md), to
the effect that Jotham had a census taken of the tribe of Gad, which was
settled on the other side of the Jordan. We see from this, that in
proportion as the northern kingdom sank down from the eminence to which
it had attained under Jeroboam II, the supremacy of Judah over the land
to the east of the Jordan was renewed. But we may see from Amos, that it
was only gradually that the kingdom of Judah revived under Uzziah, and
that at first, like the wall of Jerusalem, which was partially broken
down by Joash, it presented the aspect of a house full of fissures, and
towards Israel in a very shaky condition; also that the Ephraimitish ox-
(or calf-) worship of Jehovah was carried on at Beersheba, and therefore
upon Judaean soil, and that Judah did not keep itself free from the
idolatry which it had inherited from the fathers ([Amo
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004).md). Again, assuming that Amos
commenced his ministry at about the tenth year of Uzziah's reign, we may
learn at least so much from him with regard to Uzziah's victories over
Edom, Philistia, and Ammon, that they were not gained till after the
tenth year of his reign. Hosea, on the other hand, whose ministry
commenced at the very earliest when that of Amos was drawing to a close,
and probably not till the last five years of Jeroboam's reign, bears
witness to, and like Amos condemns, the participation in the
Ephraimitish worship, into which Judah had been drawn under
Uzziah-Jotham. But with him Beersheba is not referred to any more as an
Israelitish seat of worship ([Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005).md); Israel does not interfere any
longer with the soil of Judah, as in the time of Amos, since Judah has
again become a powerful and well-fortified kingdom ([Hos
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md), cf., [Hos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007).md). But, at the same time, it has
become full of carnal trust and manifold apostasy from Jehovah ([Hos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010.md); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md); so that, although receiving at
first a miraculous deliverance from God ([Hos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007).md), it is ripening for the same
destruction as Israel ([Hos 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011).md).

This survey of the kingdom of Judah in the time of Uzziah-Jotham by the
Israelitish prophet, we shall find repeated in Isaiah; for the same
spirit animates and determines the verdicts of the prophets of both
kingdoms.

II\. Historical Account of Ahaz and the Syro-Ephraimitish War. - The
account of Ahaz, given in the book of Kings and in the Chronicles (2
Kings 16; [Ch2 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001).md), may be divided
into three parts: viz., first, the general characteristics; secondly,
the account of the Syro-Ephraimitish war; and thirdly, the desecration
of the temple by Ahaz, more especially by setting up an altar made after
the model of that at Damascus.

(Note: On the temple at Damascus, whose altar Ahaz imitated, see the
Commentary on the Book of Job.)

(1.) [Kg2 16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001.md). Ahaz ascended the
throne in the seventeenth year of Pekah. He was then twenty years old
(or twenty-five according to the lxx at [Ch2
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md), which is much more probable, as
he would otherwise have had a son, Hezekiah, in the tenth years of his
age), and he reigned sixteen years. He did not please God as his
forefather David had done, but took the way of the kings of Israel, and
even made his son pass through the fire (i.e., burnt him in honour of
Moloch), according to the abominations of the (Canaanitish) people whom
Jehovah had driven out before Israel; and he offered sacrifice and burnt
incense upon the high places, and upon the hills, and under every green
tree. The Deuteronomic colouring of this passage is very obvious. The
corresponding passage in the Chronicles is [Ch2
28:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md), where the additional fact is
mentioned, that he even made molten images for Baalim, and burnt incense
in the valley of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire ("his
children," a generic plural like "the kings" in [Ch2
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md), and "the sons" in [Ch2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#025.md) : "burnt," ויּבער, unless the
reading ויּעבר be adopted, as it has been by the lxx, "he caused to pass
through.") (2.) [Kg2 16:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md). Then (in
the time of this idolatrous king Ahaz) the following well-known and
memorable event occurred: Rezin the king of Aram, and Pekah the son of
Remaliah king of Israel, went up against Jerusalem to war, and besieged
Ahaz, "but could not overcome him," i.e., as we may gather from [Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md), they were not able to get
possession of Jerusalem, which was the real object of their expedition.
"At that time" (the author of the book of Kings proceeds to observe),
viz., at the time of this Syro-Ephraimitish war, Rezin king of Aram
brought Elath to Aram (i.e., wrested again from the kingdom of Judah the
seaport town which Uzziah had recovered a short time before), and drove
the Judaeans out of Elath (sic); and Aramaeans came to Elath and settled
there unto this day. Thenius, who starts with the needless assumption
that the conquest of Elath took place subsequently to the futile attempt
to take Jerusalem, gives the preference to the reading of the Keri, "and
Edomites (Edomina) came to Elath," and would therefore correct l'aram
(to Aram) into l'edom (to Edom). "Rezin," he says, "destroyed the work
of Uzziah, and gave Edom its liberty again, in the hope that at some
future time he might have the support of Edom, and so operate against
Judah with greater success." But, in answer to this, it may be affirmed
that such obscure forms as ארומים for ארמּים are peculiar to this
account, and that the words do not denote the restoration of a
settlement, but mention the settlement as a new and remarkable fact. I
therefore adopt Caspari's conclusion, that the Syrian king transplanted
a Syrian colony of traders to Elath, to secure the command of the
maritime trade with all its attendant advantages; and this colony held
its ground there for some time after the destruction of the Damascene
kingdom, as the expression "to this day," found in the earlier source of
the author of the book of Kings, clearly implies.

But if the conquest of Elath fell within the period of the
Syro-Ephraimitish war, which commenced towards the end of Jotham's
reign, and probably originated in the bitter feelings occasioned by the
almost total loss to Judah of the country on the east of the Jordan, and
which assumed the form of a direct attack upon Jerusalem itself soon
after Ahaz ascended the throne; the question arises, How was it that
this design of the two allied kings upon Jerusalem was not successful?
The explanation is given in the account contained in the book of Kings
([Kg2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007).md): "Ahaz sent messengers to
Tiglath-pelezer (sic) the king of Asshur, to say to him, I am thy
servant, and thy son; come up, and save me out of the hand of Aram, and
out of the hand of the king of Israel, who have risen up against me. And
Ahaz took the silver and the gold that was found in the house of
Jehovah, and in the treasures of the palace, and sent it for a present
to the king of Asshur. The king hearkened to his petition; and went
against Damascus, and took it, and carried the inhabitants into
captivity to Kir, and slew Rezin." And what did Tiglath-pileser do with
Pekah? The author of the book of Kings has already related, in the
section referring to Pekah ([Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md), that he punished him by taking
away the whole of the country to the east of the Jordan, and a large
part of the territory on this side towards the north, and carried the
inhabitants captive to Assyria. This section must be supplied here - an
example of the great liberty which the historians allowed themselves in
the selection and arrangement of their materials. The anticipation in
[Kg2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md) is also quite in accordance
with their usual style: the author first of all states that the
expedition against Jerusalem was an unsuccessful one, and then
afterwards proceeds to mention the reason for the failure - namely, the
appeal of Ahaz to Assyria for help. For I also agree with Caspari in
this, that the Syrians the Ephraimites were unable to take Jerusalem,
because the tidings reached them, that Tiglath-pileser had been appealed
to by Ahaz and was coming against them; and they were consequently
obliged to raise the siege and made a speedy retreat.

The account in the Chronicles (2 Chron 28:5-21) furnishes us with full
and extensive details, with which to supplement the very condensed
notice of the book of Kings. When we compare the two accounts, the
question arises, whether they refer to two different expeditions (and if
so, which of the two refers to the first expedition and which to the
second), or whether they both relate to the same expedition. Let us
picture to ourselves first of all the facts as given by the chronicler.
"Jehovah, his God," he says of Ahaz, "delivered him into the hand of the
king of Aram, and they (the Aramaeans) smote him, and carried off from
him a great crowd of captives, whom they brought to Damascus; and he was
also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who inflicted upon him a
terrible defeat." This very clearly implies, as Caspari has shown, that
although the two kings set the conquest of Jerusalem before them as a
common end at which to aim, and eventually united for the attainment of
this end, yet for a time they acted separately. We are not told here in
what direction Rezin's army went. But we know from [Kg2
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006.md) that it marched to Idumaea, which
it could easily reach from Damascus by going through the territory of
his ally - namely, the country of the two tribes and a half. The
chronicler merely describes the simultaneous invasion of Judaea by
Pekah, but he does this with all the greater fulness.

"Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand
in one day, all valiant men, because they forsook Jehovah, the God of
their fathers. Zichri, an Ephraimitish hero, slew Ma'asejahu the king's
son, and Azrikam the governor of the palace, and Elkanah, the second in
rank to the king. And the Israelites carried away captive of their
brethren two hundred thousand women, boys, and girls, and took away much
spoil from them, and brought this booty to Samaria." As the Jewish army
numbered at that time three hundred thousand men ([Ch2
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#005.md); [Ch2
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#013).md), and the war was carried on
with the greatest animosity, these numbers need not be regarded as
either spurious or exaggerated. Moreover, the numbers, which the
chronicler found in the sources he employed, merely contained the
estimate of the enormous losses sustained, as generally adopted at that
time of the side of Judah itself.

This bloody catastrophe was followed by a very fine and touching
occurrence. A prophet of Jehovah, named Oded (a contemporary of Hosea,
and a man of kindred spirit), went out before the army as it came back
to Samaria, and charged the victors to release the captives of their
brother nation, which had been terribly punished in God's wrath, and by
so doing to avert the wrath of God which threatened them as well. Four
noble Ephraimitish heads of tribes, whose names the chronicler has
preserved, supported the admonition of the prophet. The army then placed
the prisoners and the booty at the disposal of the princes and the
assembled people: "And these four memorable men rose up, and took the
prisoners, and all their naked ones they covered with the booty, and
clothed and shod them, and gave them to eat and drink, and anointed
them, and conducted as many of them as were cripples upon asses, and
brought them to Jericho the palm-city, to the neighbourhood of their
brethren, and returned to Samaria." Nothing but the rudest scepticism
could ever seek to cast a slur upon this touching episode, the truth of
which is so conspicuous. There is nothing strange in the fact that so
horrible a massacre should be followed by a strong manifestation of the
fraternal love, which had been forcibly suppressed, but was not
rekindled by the prophet's words. We find an older fellow-piece to this
in the prevention of a fratricidal war by Shemaiah, as described in [Kg1
12:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#022.md).

Now, when the chronicler proceeds to observe in [Ch2
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md), that "at that time Ahaz turned
for help to the royal house of Assyria" (malce asshur), in all
probability this took place at the time when he had sustained two severe
defeats, one at the hands of Pekah to the north of Jerusalem; and
another from Rezin in Idumaea. The two battles belong to the period
before the siege of Jerusalem, and the appeal for help from Assyria
falls between the battles and the siege. The chronicler then mentions
other judgments which fell upon the king in his estrangement from God,
viz.: (1.) "Moreover the Edomites came, smote Judah, and carried away
captives;" possibly while the Syro-Ephraimitish war was still going on,
after they had welcomed Rezin as their deliverer, had shaken off the
Jewish yoke, and had supported the Syrian king against Judah in their
own land; (2.) the Philistines invaded the low land (shephelah) and the
south land (negeb) of Judah, and took several towns, six of which the
chronicler mentions by name, and settled in them; for "Jehovah humbled
Judah because of Ahaz the king of Israel (an epithet with several
sarcastic allusions), for he acted without restraint in Judah, and most
wickedly against Jehovah." The breaking away of the Philistines from the
Jewish dominion took place, according to Caspari, in the time of the
Syro-Ephraimitish war. The position of [Ch2
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md) in the section reaching from
[Ch2 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005.md) to [Ch2
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md) (viz., [Ch2
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md), invasion of the Philistines;
[Ch2 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017), that of the Edomites.md)
renders this certainly very probable, though it is not conclusive, as
Caspari himself admits.

In [Ch2 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020.md), [Ch2
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md), the chronicler adds an appendix
to the previous list of punishments: Tiglath-Pilnezer (sic) the king of
Asshur came upon him, and oppressed him instead of strengthening him;
for Ahaz had plundered both temple and palace, and given the treasures
to the king of Asshur, without receiving any proper help in return.
Thenius disputes the rendering, "He strengthened him not" (cf., [Eze
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021).md); but Caspari has shown that it
is quite in accordance with the facts of the case. Tiglath-pileser did
not bring Ahaz any true help; for what he proceeded to do against Syria
and Israel was not taken in hand in the interests of Ahaz, but to extend
his own imperial dominion. He did not assist Ahaz to bring ether the
Edomites or the Philistines into subjection again, to say nothing of
compensating him for his losses with either Syrian or Ephraimitish
territory. Nor was it only that he did not truly help him: he really
oppressed him, by making him a tributary vassal instead of a free and
independent prince - a relation to Asshur which, according to many
evident signs, was the direct consequence of his appeal for help, and
which was established, at any rate, at the very commencement of
Hezekiah's reign. Under what circumstances this took place we cannot
tell; but it is very probable that, after the victories over Rezin and
Pekah, a second sum of money was demanded by Tiglath-pileser, and then
from that time forward a yearly tribute. The expression used by the
chronicler-"he came upon him" - seems, in fact, to mean that he gave
emphasis to this demand by sending a detachment of his army; even if we
cannot take it, as Caspari does, in a rhetorical rather than a purely
historical sense, viz., as signifying that, "although Tiglath-pileser
came, as Ahaz desired, his coming was not such as Ahaz desired, a coming
to help and benefit, but rather to oppress and injure."

(3.) The third part of the two historical accounts describes the
pernicious influence which the alliance with Tiglath-pileser exerted
upon Ahaz, who was already too much inclined to idolatry ([Kg2
16:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010).md). After Tiglath-pileser had
marched against the ruler of Damascus, and delivered Ahaz from the more
dangerous of his two adversaries (and possibly from both of them), Ahaz
went to Damascus to present his thanks in person. There he saw the altar
(which was renowned as a work of art), and sent an exact model to Uriah
the high priest, who had an altar constructed like it by the time that
the king returned. As soon as Ahaz came back he went up to this altar
and offered sacrifice, thus officiating as priest himself (probably as a
thanksgiving for the deliverance he had received). The brazen altar (of
Solomon), which Uriah had moved farther forward to the front of the
temple building, he put farther back again, placing it close to the
north side of the new one (that the old one might not appear to have the
slightest preference over the new), and commanded the high priest to
perform the sacrificial service in future upon the new great altar;
adding, at the same time, "And (as for) the brazen altar, I will
consider (what shall be done with it)." "And king Ahaz," it is stated
still further, "broke out the borders of the stools, and took away the
basons; and the sea he took down from the oxen that bare it, and set it
upon a stone pedestal (that took the place of the oxen). And the covered
sabbath-hall which had been built in the temple, and the outer king's
entrance, he removed into the temple of Jehovah before the king of
Assyria." Thenius explains this as meaning "he altered them" (taking
away the valuable ornaments from both), that he might be able to take
with him to Damascus the necessary presents for the king of Asshur.
Ewald's explanation, however, is better than this, and more in
accordance with the expression "before," viz., "in order that he might
be able to secure the continued favour of the dreaded Assyrian king, by
continually sending him fresh presents." But הסבdoes not mean to alter,
and בית ה = בבית ה would be an unmeaning addition in the wrong place,
which would only obscure the sense. If the great alterations mentioned
in [Kg2 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017.md) were made for the
purpose of sending presents to the king of Assyria with or from the
things that were removed, those described in [Kg2
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018.md) were certainly made from fear of
the king; and, what appears most probable to me, not to remove the two
splendid erections from the sight of the Assyrians, nor to preserve
their being used in the event of an Assyrian occupation of Jerusalem,
but in order that his relation to the great king of Assyria might not be
disturbed by his appearing as a zealous worshipper of Jehovah. They were
changes made from fear of man and servility, and were quite in keeping
with the hypocritical, insincere, and ignoble character of Ahaz. The
parallel passage in the Chronicles is [Ch2
28:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md). "In the time of his
distress," says the chronicler in his reflective and rhetorical style,
"he sinned still more grievously against Jehovah: he, king Ahaz. He
sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, who had smitten him. For the gods of
the kings of Aram, he said, helped them; I will sacrifice to them, that
they may also help me. And they brought him and all Israel to ruin. And
Ahaz collected together the vessels of the house of God, and cut them in
pieces, and shut the doors of the house of Jehovah, and made himself
altars in ever corner of Jerusalem. And in every town of Judah he
erected high places to burn incense to other gods, and stirred up the
displeasure of Jehovah the God of his fathers." Thenius regards this
passage as an exaggerated paraphrase of the parallel passage in the book
of Kings, and as resting upon a false interpretation of the latter. But
the chronicler does not affirm that Ahaz dedicated the new altar to the
gods of Damascus, but rather that in the time of the Syro-Ephraimitish
war he attempted to secure for himself the same success in war as the
Syrians had obtained, by worshipping their gods. The words of Ahaz,
which are reported by him, preclude any other interpretation. He there
states - what by no means contradicts the book of Kings - that Ahaz laid
violent hands upon the furniture of the temple. All the rest - namely,
the allusion to his shutting the temple - gates, and erecting altars and
high places on every hand - is a completion of the account in the book
of Kings, the historical character of which it is impossible to dispute,
if we bear in mind that the Syro-Ephraimitish war took place at the
commencement of the reign of Ahaz, who was only sixteen years old at the
time.

The author of the book of Kings closes the history of the reign of Ahaz
with a reference to the annals of the kings of Judah, and with the
remark that he was buried in the city of David ([Kg2
16:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#019).md). The chronicler refers to
the book of the kings of Judah and Israel, and observes that he was
indeed buried in the city (lxx "in the city of David"), but not in the
king's sepulchre ([Ch2 28:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#026).md). The
source employed by the chronicler was his midrash of the entire history
of the kings; from which he made extracts, with the intention of
completing the text of our book of Kings, to which he appended his work.
His style was formed after that of the annals, whilst that of the author
of the book of Kings is formed after Deuteronomy. But from what source
did the author of the book of Kings make his extracts? The section
relating to Ahaz has some things quite peculiar to itself, as compared
with the rest of the book, viz., a liking for obscure forms, such as
Eloth ([Kg2 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006).md), hakkomim ([Kg2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007).md), Dummesek ([Kg2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010).md), and Aromim ([Kg2
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006).md); the name Tiglath-peleser;

(Note: This mode of spelling the name, also the one adopted by the
chronicler (Tiglath-pilnezer), are both incorrect. Pal is the Assyrian
for son, and according to Oppert (Expdition Scientifique en Msopotamie),
the whole name would read thus: Tiglatḣpalli̇shiar, i.e., reverence to
the son of the zodiac (the Assyrian Hercules).)

מכף instead of מיד, which is customary elsewhere; the rare and more
colloquial term jehudim (Jews); the inaccurate construction את־המסגרות
המכונות ([Kg2 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017).md); and the verb
בּקּר (to consider, [Kg2 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015).md), which
does not occur anywhere else.

These peculiarities may be satisfactorily explained on the assumption
that the author employed the national annals; and that, as these annals
had been gradually composed by the successive writings of many different
persons, whilst there was an essential uniformity in the mode in which
the history was written, there was also of necessity a great variety in
the style of composition. But is the similarity between [Kg2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md) and [Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md) reconcilable with this annalistic
origin? The resemblance in question certainly cannot be explained, as
Thenius supposes, from the fact that [Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md) was also taken from the national
annals; but rather on the ground assigned by Caspari - namely, that the
author of the Chronicles had not only the national annals before him,
but also the book of Isaiah's prophecies, to which he directs his
readers' attention by commencing the history of the Syro-Ephraimitish
war in the words of the portion relating to Ahaz. The design of the two
allies, as we know from the further contents of Isaiah 1, was nothing
less than to get possession of Jerusalem, to overthrow the Davidic
government there, and establish in its stead, in the person of a certain
ben-Tāb'êl ("son of Tabeal," [Isa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006).md), a newly created dynasty, that
would be under subjection to themselves. The failure of this intention
is the thought that is briefly indicated in [Kg2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md) and [Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md).

III\. Historical Account of Hezekiah, more especially of the first six
years of his reign. - The account given of Hezekiah in the book of Kings
is a far more meagre one than we should expect to find, when we have
taken out the large section relating to the period of the Assyrian
catastrophe (2 Kings 18:13-20:19), which is also found in the book of
Isaiah, and which will come under review in the commentary on Isaiah
36-39. All that is then left to the author of the book of Kings is [Kg2
18:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001.md) and [Kg2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#020.md), [Kg2
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#021.md); and in these two paragraphs,
which enclose the section of Isaiah, there are only a few annalistic
elements worked up in Deuteronomical style. Hezekiah began to reign in
the third year of Hosea king of Israel. He was twenty-five years old
when he came to the throne, and reigned twenty-nine years. He was a king
after the model of David. He removed the high places, broke in pieces
the statutes, cut down the Asheroth, and pounded the serpent, which had
been preserved from the time of Moses, and had become an object of
idolatrous worship. In his confidence in Jehovah he was unequalled by
any of his followers or predecessors. The allusion here is to that faith
of his, by which he broke away from the tyranny of Asshur, and also
recovered his supremacy over the Philistines. We have no means of
deciding in what years of Hezekiah's reign these two events - the revolt
from Asshur, and the defeat of the Philistines - occurred. The author
proceeds directly afterwards, with a studious repetition of what he has
already stated in [Isa 17:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md) in the
history of Hosea's reign,

(Note: The Chabor nehar Gozan (Eng. ver.: Habor by the river of Gozan),
which is mentioned in both passages among the districts to which the
Israelitish exiles were taken, is no doubt the Châbūr, which flows into
the Tigris from the east above Mosul, and of which it is stated in
Merâsid ed. Juynboll, that "it comes from the mountains of the land of
Zauzn," a district of outer Armenia lying towards the Tigris, which is
described by Edrisi in Jaubert's translation, Pt. ii. p. 330. Another
river, on the banks of which Ezekiel's colony of exiles lived, is the
Chebar, which flows from the north-east into the Euphrates, and the
source of which is in the Mesopotamian town of Râs-el-'ain, a place
celebrated through the marvellous springs of this Chaboras, the praises
of which have often been sung.)

to describe Shalmanassar's expedition against Israel in the fourth year
of Hezekiah's reign (the seventh of Hosea's), and the fall of Samaria,
which took place, after a siege of three years, in the sixth year of
Hezekiah's reign, and the ninth of Hosea's. But as Shalmanassar made no
attack upon Judah at the time when he put an end to the kingdom of
Israel, the revolt of Hezekiah cannot have taken place till afterwards.
But with regard to the victory over the Philistines, there is nothing in
the book of Kings to help us even to a negative conclusion. In [Kg2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#020.md), [Kg2
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#021.md), the author brings his history
rapidly to a close, and merely refers such as may desire to know more
concerning Hezekiah, especially concerning his victories and aqueducts,
to the annals of the kings of Judah.

The chronicler merely gives an extract from the section of Isaiah; but
he is all the more elaborate in the rest. All that he relates in 2 Chron
29:2-31 is a historical commentary upon the good testimony given to king
Hezekiah in the book of Kings ([Kg2
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#003).md), which the chronicler places at
the head of his own text in [Ch2 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#002.md).
Even in the month Nisan of the first year of his reign, Hezekiah
re-opened the gates of the temple, had it purified from the defilement
consequent upon idolatry, and appointed a re-consecration of the
purified temple, accompanied with sacrifice, music, and psalms ([Isa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003)..md). Hezekiah is introduced here (a
fact of importance in relation to Isaiah 38) as the restorer of "the
song of the Lord" (Shir Jehovah), i.e., of liturgical singing. The
Levitical and priestly music, as introduced and organized by David, Gad,
and Nathan, was heard again, and Jehovah was praised once more in the
words of David the king and Asaph the seer. The chronicler then relates
in Isaiah 30 how Hezekiah appointed a solemn passover in the second
month, to which even inhabitants of the northern kingdom, who might be
still in the land, were formally and urgently invited. It was an
after-passover, which was permitted by the law, as the priests had been
busy with the purification of the temple in the first month, and
therefore had been rendered unclean themselves: moreover, there would
not have been sufficient time for summoning the people to Jerusalem. The
northern tribes as a whole refused the invitation in the most scornful
manner, but certain individuals accepted it with penitent hearts. It was
a feast of joy, such as had not been known since the time of Solomon
(this statement is not at variance with [Kg2
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#022).md), affording, as it did, once
more a representation and assurance of that national unity which had
been rent in twain ever since the time of Rehoboam. Caspari has entered
into a lengthened investigation as to the particular year of Hezekiah's
reign in which this passover was held. He agrees with Keil, that it took
place after the fall of Samaria and the deportation of the people by
Shalmanassar; but he does not feel quite certain of his conclusion. The
question itself, however, is one that ought not to be raised at all, if
we think the chronicler a trustworthy authority. He places this passover
most unquestionably in the second month of the first year of Hezekiah's
reign; and there is no difficulty occasioned by this, unless we regard
what Tiglath-pileser had done to Israel as of less importance than it
actually was. The population that was left behind was really nothing
more than a remnant; and, moreover, the chronicler draws an evident
contrast between tribes and individuals, so that he was conscious enough
that there were still whole tribes of the northern kingdom who were
settled in their own homes. He then states in [Ch2
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md), that the inhabitants of the
towns of Judah (whom he calls "all Israel," because a number of emigrant
Israelites had settled there) went forth, under the influence of the
enthusiasm consequent upon the passover they had celebrated, and broke
in pieces the things used in idolatrous worship throughout both
kingdoms; and in [Ch2 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#002.md)., that
Hezekiah restored the institutions of divine worship that had been
discontinued, particularly those relating to the incomes of the priests
and Levites. Everything else that he mentions in 32:1-26, [Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md), belongs to a later period than
the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign; and so far as it differs from
the section in Isaiah, which is repeated in the book of Kings, it is a
valuable supplement, more especially with reference to [Kg2
22:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008.md) (which relates to precautions
taken in the prospect of the approaching Assyrian siege). But the
account of Hezekiah's wealth in [Ch2
32:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027.md) extends over the whole of his
reign. The notice respecting the diversion of the upper Gihon ([Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030).md) reaches rather into the period
of the return after the Assyrian catastrophe, than into the period
before it; but nothing can be positively affirmed.

Having thus obtained the requisite acquaintance with the historical
accounts which bear throughout upon the book of Isaiah, so far as it has
for its starting-point and object the history of the prophet's own
times, we will now turn to the book itself, for the purpose of acquiring
such an insight into its general plan as is necessary to enable us to
make a proper division of our own work of exposition.

Arrangement of the Collection

We may safely enter upon our investigation with the preconceived opinion
that the collection before us was edited by the prophet himself. For,
with the exception of the book of Jonah, which belongs to the
prophetico-historical writings rather than to the literature of
prediction, or the prophetical writings in the ordinary acceptation of
the term, all the canonical books of prophecy were written and arranged
by the prophets whose names they bear. The most important to our purpose
is the analogy of the larger books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. No one
denies that Ezekiel prepared his work for publication exactly as it lies
before us now; and Jeremiah informs us himself, that he collected and
published his prophecies on two separate occasions. Both collections are
arranged according to the two different points of view of the
subject-matter and the order of time, which are interwoven the one with
the other. And this is also the case with the collection of Isaiah's
prophecies. As a whole, it is arranged chronologically. The dates given
in [Isa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md); [Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md); [Isa
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028.md); [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md), are so many points in a
progressive line. The three principal divisions also form a
chronological series. For Isaiah 1-6 set forth the ministry of Isaiah
under Uzziah-Jotham; Isaiah 7-39, his ministry under Ahaz and Hezekiah
down to the fifteenth year of the reign of the latter; whilst Isaiah
40-66, assuming their authenticity, were the latest productions of the
deepest inner-life, and were committed directly to writing. In the
central part, the Ahaz group (Isaiah 7-12) also precedes the Hezekiah
group (Isaiah 13-39) chronologically. But the order of time is
interrupted in several places by an arrangement of the subject-matter,
which was of greater importance to the prophet. The address in Isaiah 1
is not the oldest, but is placed at the head as an introduction to the
whole. The consecration of the prophet ([Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md), which ought to stand at the
beginning of the Uzziah-Jotham group, if it relates to his original
consecration to his office, is placed at the end, where it looks both
backwards and forwards, as a prophecy that was in course of fulfilment.
The Ahaz group, which follows next (Isaiah 7-12), is complete in itself,
and, as it were, from one casting. And in the Hezekiah group (Isaiah
13-39) the chronological order is frequently interrupted again. The
prophecies against the nations ([Isa
14:24-32](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024).md), which belong to the
Assyrian period, have a massa upon Babel, the city of the world's power,
for their opening piece (Isaiah 13-14:23); a massa upon Tyre, the city
of the world's commerce, which was to be destroyed by the Chaldeans, for
their finale (Isaiah 23); and a shorter massa upon Babel, for a
party-wall dividing the cycle into two halves ([Isa
21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001).md); and all the prophecies upon
the nations run into a grand apocalyptic epilogue (Isaiah 24-27), like
rivers into a sea. The first part of the Hezekiah group, the contents of
which are pre-eminently ethnic (Isaiah 13-27), are interwoven with
passages which may not have been composed till after the fifteenth year
of Hezekiah's reign. The grand epilogue (Isaiah 34-35), in which the
second portion of the Hezekiah group dies away, is also another such
passage. This second part is occupied chiefly with the fate of Judah,
the judgment inflicted upon Judah by the imperial power of Assyria, and
the deliverance which awaited it (Isaiah 27-33). This prediction closes
with a declaration, in Isaiah 34-35, on the one hand, of the judgment of
God upon the world of Israel's foes; and on the other hand, of the
redemption of Israel itself. This passage, which was composed after the
fifteenth year of Hezekiah's reign, is followed by the historical
portions (Isaiah 36-39), which enclose in a historical frame the
predictions of Isaiah delivered when the Assyrian catastrophe was close
at hand, and furnish us with the key to the interpretation not only of
Isaiah 7-35, but of Isaiah 40-66 also.

Taking the book of Isaiah, therefore, as a whole, in the form in which
it lies before us, it may be divided into two halves, viz., Isaiah 1-39,
and Isaiah 40-66. The former consists of seven parts, the latter of
three. The first half may be called the Assyrian, as the goal to which
it points is the downfall of Asshur; the second the Babylonian, as its
goal is the deliverance from Babel. The first half, however, is not
purely Assyrian; but there are Babylonian pieces introduced among the
Assyrian, and such others, as a rule, as break apocalyptically through
the limited horizon of the latter. The following are the seven divisions
in the first half. (1.) Prophecies founded upon the growing obduracy of
the great mass of the people (Isaiah 2-6). (2.) The consolation of
Immanuel under the Assyrian oppressions (Isaiah 7-12). These two form a
syzygy, which concludes with a psalm of the redeemed ([Isa
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001).md), the echo, in the last days,
of the song at the Red Sea. The whole is divided by the consecration of
the prophet ([Isa 6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md), which looks
backwards and forwards with threatenings and promises. It is introduced
by a summary prologue (Isaiah 1), in which the prophet, standing midway
between Moses and Jesus the Christ, commences in the style of the great
Mosaic ode. (3.) Predictions of the judgment and salvation of the
heathen, which belong, for the most part, to the time of the Assyrian
judgment, though they are enclosed and divided by Babylonian portions.
For, as we have already observed, and oracle concerning Babel, the city
of the world-power, forms the introduction (Isaiah 13-14:23); an oracle
concerning Tyre, the city of the world's commerce, which was to receive
its mortal wound from the Chaldeans, the conclusion (Isaiah 23); and a
second oracle on the desert by the sea, i.e., Babel, the centre ([Isa
21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001)). (4..md) To this so thoughtfully
arranged collection of predictions concerning the nations outside the
Israelitish pale, there is attached a grand apocalyptic prophecy of the
judgment of the world and the last things (Isaiah 24-27), which gives it
a background that fades away into eternity, and forms with it a second
syzygy. (5.) From these eschatological distances the prophet returns to
the realities of the present and of the immediate future, and describes
the revolt from Asshur, and its consequences (Isaiah 28-33). The central
point of this group is the prophecy of the precious corner-stone laid in
Zion. (6.) This is also paired off by the prophet with a far-reaching
eschatological prediction of revenge and redemption for the church
(Isaiah 34-35), in which we already hear, as in a prelude, the keynote
of Isaiah 40-66. (7.) After these three syzygies we are carried back, in
the first two historical accounts of Isaiah 36-39, into the Assyrian
times, whilst the other two show us in the distance the future
entanglement with Babylon, which was commencing already. These four
accounts are arranged without regard to the chronological order, so that
one half looks backwards and the other forwards, and thus the two halves
of the book are clasped together. The prophecy in [Isa
39:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#005.md) stands between these two halves
like a sign-post, with the inscription "To Babylon" upon it. It is
thither that the further course of Israel's history tends. There, from
this time forward, is Isaiah buried in spirit with his people. And
there, in Isaiah 40-66, he proclaims to the Babylonian exiles their
approaching deliverance. The trilogical arrangement of this book of
consolation has been scarcely disputed by any one, since it was first
pointed out by Rckert in his Translation and Exposition of Hebrew
Prophets (1831). It is divided into three sections, each containing
three times three addresses, with a kind of refrain at the close.

The Critical Questions

The collection of Isaiah's prophecies is thus a complete work, most
carefully and skilfully arranged. It is thoroughly worthy of the
prophet. Nevertheless, we should be unable to attribute it to him in its
present form, (1.) if it were impossible that Isaiah 13-14:23; [Isa
21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md); 23; 24-27; 34-35, could have
been composed by Isaiah, and (2.) if the historical accounts in Isaiah
36-39, which are also to be found in 2 Kings 18:13-20:19, have been
copied from the book of Kings, or even directly from the national
annals. For if the prophecies in question be taken away, the beautiful
whole unquestionably falls into a confused quodlibet, more especially
the book against the nations; and if Isaiah 36-39 were not written
directly by Isaiah, the two halves of the collection would be left
without a clasp to bind them together. It would be irregular to think of
deciding the critical questions bearing upon this point now, instead of
taking them up in connection with our exegetical inquiries. At the same
time, we will put the reader in possession at once of the more general
points, which cause us to dissent from the conclusions of the modern
critics, who regard the book of Isaiah as an anthology composed of the
productions of different authors.

The critical treatment of Isaiah commenced as follows: It began with the
second part. Koppe first of all expressed some doubts as to the
genuineness of Isaiah 1. Doderlein then gave utterance to a decided
suspicion as to the genuineness of the whole; and Justi, followed by
Eichhorn, Paulus, and Bertholdt, raised this suspicion into firm
assurance that the whole was spurious. The result thus obtained could
not possibly continue without reaction upon the first part. Rosenmller,
who was always very dependent upon his predecessors, was the first to
question whether the oracle against Babylon in Isaiah 13-14:23 was
really Isaiah's, as the heading affirms; and to his great relief, Justi
and Paulus undertook the defence of his position. Further progress was
now made. With the first oracle against Babylon in Isaiah 13-14:23, the
second, in [Isa 21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md), was also
condemned; and Rosenmller was justly astonished when Gesenius dropped
the former, but maintained that the arguments with regard to the latter
were inconclusive. There still remained the oracle against Tyre in
Isaiah 23, which might either be left as Isaiah's, or attributed to a
younger unknown prophet, according to the assumption that it predicted
the destruction of Tyre by Assyrians or by Chaldeans. Eichhorn, followed
by Rosenmller, decided that it was not genuine. But Gesenius understood
by the destroyers the Assyrians; and as the prophecy consequently did
not extend beyond Isaiah's horizon, he defended its authenticity. Thus
the Babylonian series was set aside, or at any rate pronounced
thoroughly suspicious. But the keen eyes of the critics made still
further discoveries. Eichhorn found a play upon words in the cycle of
predictions in Isaiah 24-27, which was unworthy of Isaiah. Gesenius
detected an allegorical announcement of the fall of Babylon.
Consequently they both condemned these three chapters; and it had its
effect, for Ewald transferred them to the time of Cambyses. Still
shorter work was made with the cycle of predictions in Isaiah 34-35, on
account of its relation to the second part. Rosenmller pronounced it,
without reserve, "a song composed in the time of the Babylonian
captivity, when it was approaching its termination." This is the true
account of the origin of the criticism upon Isaiah. It was in the
swaddling-clothes of rationalism that it attained its maturity. Its
first attempts were very juvenile. The names of its founders have been
almost forgotten. It was Gesenius, Hitzig, and Ewald, who first raised
it to the eminence of a science.

If we take our stand upon this eminence, we find that the book of Isaiah
contains prophecies by Isaiah himself, and also prophecies by persons
who were either directly or indirectly his disciples. The New Testament
passages in which the second half of the book of Isaiah is cited as
Isaiah's, are no proof of the contrary, since [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), for example, which has no
heading at all, is cited in [Act 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md)
as David's, merely because it is contained in the Davidic Psalter, and
no critic would ever feel that he was bound by that. But many objections
present themselves to such a conclusion. In the first place, nothing of
the kind can be pointed out in any of the other canonical books of
prophecy, except indeed the book of Zechariah, in which Isaiah 9-14 is
said to stand in precisely the same position as Isaiah 40-66, according
to Hitzig, Ewald, and others; with this difference, however, that Isaiah
40-66 is attributed to a later prophet than Isaiah, whereas Zech. 9-14
is attributed to one or two prophets before the time of Zechariah. But
even De Wette, who maintained, in the first three editions of his
Introduction to the Old Testament, that Zech was written before the
captivity, altered his views in the fourth edition; and Khler has lately
confirmed the unity of the book of Zechariah after an unbiased
investigation. It is Zechariah himself who prophesies of the last times
in Isaiah 9-14, in images drawn from the past, and possibly with the
introduction of earlier oracles. It remains, therefore, that not a
single book of prophecy is open to any such doubts as to the unity of
its authorship and Hitzig admits that even the book of Jeremiah,
although interpolated, does not contain spurious sections. Nevertheless,
it is quite possible that something extraordinary might have taken place
in connection with the book of Isaiah. But there are grave objections
even to such an assumption as this in the face of existing facts. For
example, it would be a marvellous occurrence in the history of chances,
for such a number of predictions of this particular kind to have been
preserved - all of them bearing so evidently the marks of Isaiah's
style, that for two thousand years the have been confounded with his own
prophecies. It would be equally marvellous that the historians should
know nothing at all about the authors of these prophecies; and thirdly,
it would be very strange that the names of these particular prophets
should have shared the common fate of being forgotten, although they
must all have lived nearer to the compiler's own times than the old
model prophet, whose style they imitated. It is true that these
difficulties are not conclusive proofs to the contrary; but, at any
rate, they are so much to the credit of the traditional authorship of
the prophecies attacked. On the other hand, the weight of this tradition
is not properly appreciated by opponents. Wilful contempt of external
testimony, and frivolity in the treatment of historical data, have been
from the very first the fundamental evils apparent in the manner in
which modern critics have handled the questions relating to Isaiah.
These critics approach everything that is traditional with the
presumption that it is false; and whoever would make a scientific
impression upon them, must first of all declare right fearlessly his
absolute superiority to the authority of tradition. Now tradition is
certainly not infallible. No more are the internal grounds of the
so-called higher criticism, especially in the questions relating to
Isaiah. And in the case before us, the external testimony is greatly
strengthened by the relation in which Zephaniah and Jeremiah, the two
most reproductive prophets, stand not only to Isaiah 40-66, but also to
the suspected sections of the first half. They had these prophecies in
their possession, since they evidently copy them, and incorporate
passages taken from them into their own prophecies; a fact which Caspari
has most conclusively demonstrated, but which not one of the negative
critics has ventured to look fairly in the face, or to set aside by
counter-proofs of equal force. Moreover, although the suspected
prophecies do indeed contain some things for which vouchers cannot be
obtained from the rest of the book, yet the marks which are distinctly
characteristic of Isaiah outweigh by far these peculiarities, which have
been picked out with such care; and even in the prophecies referred to,
it is Isaiah's spirit which animates the whole, Isaiah's heart which
beats, and Isaiah's fiery tongue which speaks in both the substance and
the form.

Again, the type of the suspected prophecies - which, if they are
genuine, belong to the prophet's latest days - is not thoroughly opposed
to the type of the rest; on the contrary, those prophecies which are
acknowledged to be genuine, present many a point of contact with this;
and even the transfigured form and richer eschatological contents of the
disputed prophecies have their preludes there. There is nothing strange
in this great variety of ideas and forms, especially in Isaiah, who is
confessedly the most universal of all the prophets, even if we only look
at those portions which are admitted to be genuine, and who varies his
style in so masterly a way to suit the demands of his materials, his
attitude, and his purpose. One might suppose that these three
counter-proofs, which can be followed up even to the most minute
details, would have some weight; but for Hitzig, Ewald, and many others,
they have absolutely none. Why not? These critics think it impossible
that the worldwide empire of Babel, and its subsequent transition to
Medes and Persians, should have been foreseen by Isaiah in the time of
Hezekiah. Hitzig affirms in the plainest terms, that the very same
Caligo futuri covered the eyes of the Old Testament prophets generally,
as that to which the human race was condemned during the time that the
oracle at Delphi was standing. Ewald speaks of the prophets in
incomparably higher terms; but even to him the prophetic state was
nothing more than a blazing up of the natural spark which lies
slumbering in every man, more especially in Ewald himself. These two
Coryphaei of the modern critical school find themselves hemmed in
between the two foregone conclusions, "There is no true prophecy," and
"There is no true miracle." They call their criticism free; but when
examined more closely, it is in a vice. In this vice it has two magical
formularies, with which it fortifies itself against any impression from
historical testimony. It either turns the prophecies into merely
retrospective glances (vaticinia post eventum), as it does the account
of miracles into sagas and myths; or it places the events predicted so
close to the prophet's own time, that there was no need of inspiration,
but only of combination, to make the foresight possible. This is all
that it can do. Now we could do more than this. We could pronounce all
the disputed prophecies the production of other authors than Isaiah,
without coming into contact with any dogmatical assumptions: we could
even boast, as in the critical analysis of the historical books, of the
extent to which the history of literature was enriched through this
analysis of the book of Isaiah. And if we seem to despise these riches,
we simply yield to the irresistible force of external and internal
evidence. This applies even to Isaiah 36-39. For whilst it is true that
the text of the book of Kings is the better of the two, yet, as we shall
be able to prove, the true relation is this, that the author of the book
of Kings did not obtain the parallel section (2 Kings 18:13-20:19) from
any other source than the book of Isaiah. We have similar evidence in
[Kg2 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md). and [Isa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md), as compared with Jer, that the
text of a passage may sometimes be preserved in greater purity in a
secondary work than in the original work from which it was taken. It was
Isaiah's prophetico-historical pen which committed to writing the
accounts in Isaiah 36-39. The prophet not only wrote a special history
of Uzziah, according to [Ch2 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#022.md),
but he also incorporated historical notices of Isaiah in his "vision"
([Ch2 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032).md). We reserve the fuller
demonstration of all this. For whilst, on the one hand, we consider
ourselves warranted in rejecting those tendencies of modern criticism,
to which naturalistic views of the world have dictated at the very
outset full-blown negative results, and we do so on the ground of
supernatural facts of personal experience; on the other hand, we are
very far from wishing to dispute the well-founded rights of criticism as
such.

For centuries, yea, for thousands of years, no objection was raised as
to the Davidic origin of a psalm headed "a psalm of David," to say
nothing of a prophecy of Isaiah; and therefore no such objection was
refuted. Apart from the whims of a few individuals,

(Note: e.g., that of Abenezra, who regarded king Jehoiakim, who was set
free in the thirty-seventh year of his Babylonian captivity, as the
author of Isaiah 40-60.).

which left no traces behind them, it was universally assumed by both
Jewish and Christian writers down to the last century, that all the
canonical books of the Old Testament had the Holy Ghost as their one
auctor primarius, and for their immediate authors the men by whose names
they are called. But when the church in the time of the Reformation
began to test and sift what had been handed down; when the rapid
progress that was made in classical and oriental philology compelled the
students of the Scriptures to make larger if not higher demands upon
themselves; when their studies were directed to the linguistic,
historical, archaeological, aesthetic - in short, the human-side of the
Scriptures, and the attempt was made to comprehend the several aspects
presented by sacred literature in their progressive development and
relation to one another - Christian science put forth many branches that
had never been anticipated till then; and biblical criticism sprang up,
which from that time forward has been not only an inalienable, but a
welcome and even necessary, member in the theological science of the
church. That school of criticism, indeed, which will not rest till all
miracles and prophecies, which cannot be set aside exegetically, have
been eliminated critically, must be regarded by the church as
self-condemned; but the labour of a spiritual criticism, and one truly
free in spirit, will not only be tolerated, because "the spiritual man
discerneth all things" ([Co1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015).md),
but will be even fostered, and not looked upon as suspicious, although
its results should seem objectionable to minds that are weakly strung,
and stand in a false and fettered attitude in relation to the
Scriptures. For it will be no more offended that the word of God should
appear in the form of a servant, than that Christ Himself should do so;
and, moreover, criticism not only brings any blemishes in the Scriptures
to the light, but affords an ever-deepening insight into its hidden
glory. It makes the sacred writings, as they lie before us, live again;
it takes us into its very laboratory; and without it we cannot possibly
obtain a knowledge of the historical production of the biblical books.

Exposition in Its Existing State

It was at the time of the Reformation also that historico-grammatical
exposition first originated with a distinct consciousness of the task
that it had to perform. It was then that the first attempt was made,
under the influence of the revival of classical studies, and with the
help of a knowledge of the language obtained from Jewish teachers, to
find out the one true meaning of the Scriptures, and an end was put to
the tedious jugglery of multiplex Scripturae sensus. But very little was
accomplished in the time of the Reformation for the prophecies of
Isaiah.

Calvin's Commentarii answer the expectations with which we take them up;
but Luther's Scholia are nothing but college notes, of the most meagre
description. The productions of Grotius, which are generally valuable,
are insignificant in Isaiah, and, indeed, throughout the prophets. He
mixes up things sacred and profane, and, because unable to follow
prophecy in its flight, cuts off its wings. Aug. Varenius of Rostock
wrote the most learned commentary of all those composed by writers of
the orthodox Lutheran school, and one that even now is not to be
despised; but though learned, it is too great a medley, and written
without discipline of mind. Campegius Vitringa († 1722) threw all the
labours of his predecessors into the shade, and none even of his
successors approach him in spirit, keenness, and scholarship. His
Commentary on Isaiah is still incomparably the greatest of all the
exegetical works upon the Old Testament. The weakest thing in the
Commentary is the allegorical exposition, which is appended to the
grammatical and historical one. In this the temperate pupil of the
Cocceian school is dependent upon what was then the prevalent style of
the commentary in Holland, where there was an utter absence of all
appreciation of the "complex-apotelesmatical" character of prophecy,
whilst the most minute allusions were traced in the prophets to events
connected with the history of both the world and the church. The shady
sides of the Commentary are generally the first to present themselves to
the reader's eye; but the longer he continues to use it, the more highly
does he learn to value it. There is deep research everywhere, but
nowhere a luxuriance of dry and dead scholarship. The author's heart is
in his work. He sometimes halts in his toilsome path of inquiry, and
gives vent to loud, rapturous exclamations. But the rapture is very
different from that of the Lord Bishop Robert Lowth, who never gets
below the surface, who alters the Masoretic text at his pleasure, and
goes no further than an aesthetic admiration of the form.

The modern age of exegesis commenced with that destructive theology of
the latter half of the eighteenth century, which pulled down without
being able to build. But even this demolition was not without good
result. The negative of anything divine and eternal in the Scriptures
secured a fuller recognition of its human and temporal side, bringing
out the charms of its poetry, and, what was of still greater importance,
the concrete reality of its history. Rosenmller's Scholia are a careful,
lucid, and elegant compilation, founded for the most part upon Vitringa,
and praiseworthy not only for the judicious character of the selection
made, but also for the true earnestness which is displayed, and the
entire absence of all frivolity. The decidedly rationalistic Commentary
of Gesenius is more independent in its verbal exegesis; displays great
care in its historical expositions; and is peculiarly distinguished for
its pleasing and transparent style, for the survey which it gives of the
whole of the literature bearing upon Isaiah, and the thoroughness with
which the author avails himself of all the new sources of grammatical
and historical knowledge that have been opened since the days of
Vitringa. Hitzig's Commentary is his best work in our opinion, excelling
as it does in exactness and in the sharpness and originality of its
grammatical criticisms, as well as in delicate tact in the discovery of
the train of thought and in thoroughness and precision in the exposition
of well-pondered results; but it is also disfigured by rash
pseudo-critical caprice, and by a studiously profane spirit, utterly
unaffected by the spirit of prophecy. Hendewerk's Commentary is often
very weak in philological and historical exposition. The style of
description is broad, but the eye of the disciple of Herbart is too dim
to distinguish Israelitish prophecy from heathen poetry, and the
politics of Isaiah from those of Demosthenes. Nevertheless, we cannot
fail to observe the thoughtful diligence displayed, and the anxious
desire to point out the germs of eternal truths, although the author is
fettered even in this by his philosophical standpoint. Ewald's natural
penetration is universally recognised, as well as the noble enthusiasm
with which he dives into the contents of the prophetical books, in which
he finds an eternal presence. His earnest endeavours to obtain deep
views are to a certain extent rewarded. But there is something
irritating in the self-sufficiency with which he ignores nearly all his
predecessors, the dictatorial assumption of his criticism, his false and
often nebulous pathos, and his unqualified identification of his own
opinions with truth itself. He is a perfect master in the
characteristics of the prophets, but his translations of them are stiff,
and hardly to any one's taste. Umbreit's Practical Commentary on Isaiah
is a useful and stimulating production, exhibiting a deep aesthetic and
religious sensibility to the glory of the prophetic word, which
manifests itself in lofty poetic language, heaping image upon image,
and, as it were, never coming down from the cothrunus. Knobel's prose is
the very opposite extreme. The precision and thoroughness of this
scholar, the third edition of whose Commentary on Isaiah was one of his
last works (he died, 25th May 1863), deserve the most grateful
acknowledgment, whether from a philological or an archaeological point
of view; but his peculiar triviality, which amounts almost to an
affectation, seems to shut his eyes to the deeper meaning of the work,
whilst his excessive tendency to "historize" (historisiren, i.e., to
give a purely historical interpretation to everything) makes him blind
even to the poetry of the form. Drechsler's Commentary was a great
advance in the exposition of Isaiah. He was only able to carry it out
himself as far as [Isa 27:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md); but is
was completed by Delitzsch and H. A. Hahn of Greifswald († 1st Dec.
1861), with the use of Drechsler's notes, though they contained very
little that was of any service in relation to Isaiah 40-66. This was,
comparatively speaking, the best commentary upon Isaiah that had
appeared since the time of Vitringa, more especially the portion on
Isaiah 13-27. Its peculiar excellency is not to be found in the
exposition of single sentences, which is unsatisfactory, on account of
the comminuting, glossatorial style of its exegesis, and, although
diligent and thorough enough, is unequal and by no means productive,
more especially from a grammatical point of view; but in the spiritual
and spirited grasp of the whole, the deep insight which it exhibits into
the character and ideas of the prophet and of prophecy, its vigorous
penetration into the very heart of the plan and substance of the whole
book. In the meantime (1850), there had appeared the Commentary written
by the catholic Professor Peter Schegg, which follows the Vulgate,
although with as little slavishness as possible, and contains many good
points, especially the remarks relating to the history of translation.
At the same time there also appeared the Commentary of Ernst Meier, the
Tbingen orientalist, which did not get beyond the first half. If ever
any one was specially called to throw fresh light upon the book of
Isaiah, it was C. P. Caspari of Christiania; but all that has yet
appeared of his Norwegian Commentary only reaches to the end of Isaiah
5. Its further progress has been hindered partly by the exhaustive
thoroughness at which he aimed, and the almost infinite labour which it
involved, and partly by the fact that the Grundtvig controversy involved
him in the necessity of pursuing the most extensive studies in
ecclesiastical history. In the meantime, he has so far expanded his
treatise om Serapherne (on the Seraphim), that it may be regarded as a
commentary on [Isa 6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md); and rich
materials for the prophetic sayings which follow may be found in his
contributions to the introduction to the book of Isaiah, and to the
history of Isaiah's own times, which appeared as a second volume of our
biblico-theological and apologetico-critical Studien (1858), his
Programme on the Syro-Ephraimitish war (1849), and his comprehensive and
by no means obsolete article, entitled, "Jeremiah a witness to the
genuineness of Isaiah 34, and therefore also to that of Isaiah
13:1-14:23, and [Isa 21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md)," which
appeared in the Zeitschrift fr d. ges. luth. Theologie u. Kirche (1843),
together with an excursus on the relation of Zephaniah to the disputed
prophecies of Isaiah.

We shall reserve those works which treat more particularly of the second
part of the book of Isaiah for our special introduction to that part.
But there are two other distinguished commentaries that we must mention
here, both of them by Jewish scholars: viz., that of the M. L. Malbim
(Krotoshin 1849), which is chiefly occupied with the precise ideas
conveyed by synonymous words and groups of words; and that of S. D.
Luzzatto of Padua - a stimulating work, entitled Profeta Isaia
volgarizzato e commentato ad uso degli Israeliti, which aims throughout
at independence, but of which only five parts have yet appeared.

Appendix to Isaiah

Introduction/Exposition of Its Existing State

In the commentary on the second half of Isaiah 40-66, I have referred
here and there to the expositions of J. Heinemann (Berlin 1842) and
Isaiah Hochstdter (Carlsruhe 1827), both written in Hebrew - the former
well worthy of notice for criticism of the text, the latter provided
with a German translation. For the psalm of Hezekiah (ch. 38) Professor
Sam. David Luzzatto of Padua lent me his exposition in manuscript. Since
then this great and noble-minded man has departed this life (on the 29th
Sept. 1865). His commentary on Isaiah, so far as it has been printed, is
full of information and of new and stirring explanations, written in
plain, lucid, rabbinical language. It would be a great misfortune for
the second half of this valuable work to remain unprinted. I well
remember the assistance which the deceased afforded me in my earlier
studies of the history of the post-biblical Jewish poetry (1836), and
the affection which he displayed when I renewed my former acquaintance
with him on the occasion of his publishing his Isaiah; so that I lament
his loss on my own account as well as in the interests of science. "Why
have you allowed twenty-five years to pass," he wrote to me on the 22nd
Feb. 1863, "without telling me that you remembered me? Is it because we
form different opinions of the עלמה and the ילד ילד לנו of Isaiah? Are
you a sincere Christian? Then you are a hundred times dearer to me than
so many Israelitish scholars, the partizans of Spinoza, with whom our
age swarms." These words indicate very clearly the standpoint taken in
his writings.

Of the commentaries written in English, I am acquainted not only with
Lowth, but with the thoroughly practical commentary of Henderson (1857),
and that of Joseph Addison Alexander, Prov. in Princeton (1847, etc.),
which is very much read as an exegetical repertorium in England also.
But I had neither of them in my possession.

[Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

What I have said here on [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md) as
the heading to the whole book, or at any rate to Isaiah 1-39, has been
said in part by Photios also in his Amphilochia, which Sophocles the
M.D. has published complete from a MS of Mount Athos (Athens 1858, 4).

[Isa 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md)

Hofmann in his Schriftbeweis (ii. 2, 541) maintains with Knobel, that
מצּבת cannot be shown to have any other meaning than "plant." It is
never met with in this sense, which it might have (after נצב = נטע = נ),
though it is in the sense of statua and cippus, which, when applied to a
tree deprived of its crown, can only mean stipes or truncus. - We take
this opportunity of referring to a few other passages of his work: [Isa
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md). "And the deep darkness is scared
away: menuddâch with the accusative of the object used with the
passive." But this is only possible with the finite verb, not with the
passive participle. [Isa 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md). "By the
fact that Thou hast made the people many, Thou hast not made the joy
great; but now they rejoice before Thee (who hast appeared)." It is
impossible that הרבית and הגדלת, when thus surrounded with perfects
relating to the history of the future, should itself relate to the
historical past - [Isa 18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md). "It is
Israel in its dispersion which is referred to here as a people carried
away and spoiled, but which from that time forward is an object of
reverential awe - a people that men have cut in pieces and trampled
under foot, whose land streams have rent in pieces." But does not this
explanation founder on נורא מן־הוא והלאה? In the midst of attributes
which point to ill-treatment, can this passage be meant to describe the
position which Israel is henceforth to hold as one commanding respect
(see our exposition)? - [Isa 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md).
"Egypt the land of cities will be reduced to five cities by the judgment
that falls upon it." But how can the words affirm that there will be
only five cities in all, when there is nothing said about desolation in
the judgment predicted before? - [Isa
21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md). "What the watchman on the
watch-tower see is not the hostile army marching against Babel, but the
march of the people of God returning home from Babel." Consequently
tsemed pârâshı̄m does not mean pairs of horsemen, but carriages full of
men and drawn by horses. But we can see what tsemed pârâshı̄m is from
[Kg2 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025) (rōkhebhı̄m tsemâdı̄m.md), and
from the combination of rekhebh and pârâshı̄m (chariots and horsemen) in
[Isa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#007.md); [Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md). And the rendering "carriages"
will never do for [Isa 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007.md), [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md). Carriages with camels harnessed
to them would be something unparalleled; and rekhebh gâmâl (cf., [Sa1
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#017).md) by the side of tsemed pârâshı̄m
has a warlike sound.

[Isa 10:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md)

Professor Schegg travelled by this very route to Jerusalem (cf., p. 560,
Anm. 2): From Gifneh he went direct to Tayibeh (which he imagined to be
the ancient Ai), and then southwards through Muchmas, Geba, Hizmeh,
'Anata, and el-Isawiye to Jerusalem.

[Isa 33:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md)

No (Nō' 'Amōn in [Nah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008).md) is the
Egyptian nu-Amun = Διόσπολις (nu the spelling of the hieroglyphic of the
plan of the city, with which the name of the goddess Nu̇ t = Rhea is also
written). The ordinary spelling of the name of this city corresponds to
the Greek ̓Αμμωνόπολις.

[Isa 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023.md)

(Compare Grashof, Ueber das Schiff bei Homer und Hesiod,
Gymnasial-programm 1834, p. 23ff.). The μεσόδμη (= μεσοδόμη) is the
cross plank which connects the two sides of the ship. A piece is cut out
of this on the side towards the rudder, in which the mast is supported,
being also let into a hole in the boards of the keel (ἱστοπέδη) and
there held fast. The mast is also prevented from falling backwards by
ropes or stays carried forward to the bows (πρότονοι). On landing, the
mast is laid back into a hollow place in the bottom of the ship
(ἱστοδόκη). If the stays are not drawn tight, the mast may easily fall
backwards, and so slip not only out of the μεσόδμη but out of the
ἱστοπέδη also. This is the meaning of the words בּל־יהזּקוּ כן־תּרנם. It
would be better to understand kēn as referring to the ἱστοπέδη than to
the μεσόδμη. The latter has no "hole," but only a notch, i.e., a
semicircular piece cut out, and serves as a support to the mast; the
former, on the contrary, has the mast inserted into it, and serves as a
kēn, i.e., a basis, theca, loculamentum. Vitringa observes (though
without knowing the difference between μεσόδμη and ἱστοπέδη): "Oportet
accedere funes, qui thecam firment, h. e. qui malum sustinentes thecae
succurrant, qui quod theca sola per se praestare nequit absque funibus
cum ea veluti concurrentes efficiant."

[Isa 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016.md)

This transition from words of Jehovah concerning Himself to words
relating to Him, may also be removed by adopting the following
rendering: "For my mouth, it has commanded it, and its (my mouth's)
breath, it has brought it together" (rūchō = rūăch pı̄, [Psa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006.md); [Job
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030).md).

[Isa 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#030.md)

I am wrong in describing it here as improbable that the land would have
to be left uncultivated during the year 713-12 in consequence of the
invasion that had taken place, even after the departure of the
Assyrians. Wetzstein has referred me to his Appendix on the Monastery of
Job (see Comm. on Job, Appendix), where he has shown that the
fallow-land (wâghia) of a community, which is sown in the autumn of 1865
and reaped in the summer of 1866, must have been broken up, i.e.,
ploughed for the first time, in the winter of 1864-65. "If this breaking
up of the fallow (el-Būr) were obliged to be omitted in the winter of
1864-65, because of the enemy being in the land, whether from the
necessity for hiding the oxen in some place of security, or from the
fact that they had been taken from the peasants and consumed by the foe,
it would be impossible to sow in the autumn of 1865 and reap a harvest
in the summer of 1866. And if the enemy did not withdraw till the
harvest of 1865, only the few who had had their ploughing oxen left by
the war would find it possible to break up the fallow. But neither the
one nor the other could sow, if the enemy's occupation of the land had
prevented them from ploughing in the winter of 1864-65. If men were to
sow in the newly broken fallow, they would reap no harvest, and the seed
would only be lost. It is only in the volcanic and therefore fertile
region of Haurân (Bashan) that the sowing of the newly broken fallow
(es-sikak) yields a harvest, and there it is only when the winter brings
a large amount of rain; so that even in Haurân nothing but necessity
leads any one to sow upon the sikak. In western Palestine, even in the
most fruitful portions of it (round Samaria and Nazareth), the farmer is
obliged to plough three times before he can sow; and a really good
farmer follows up the breaking up of the fallow (sikak) in the winter,
the second ploughing (thânia) in the spring, and the third ploughing
(tethlith) in the summer, with a fourth (terbı̄a) in the latter part of
the summer. Consequently no sowing could take place in the autumn of
713, if the enemy had been in the land in the autumn of 714, in
consequence of his having hindered the farmer from the sikak in the
winter of 714-3, and from the thânia and tethlith in the spring and
summer of 713. There is no necessity, therefore, to assume that a second
invasion took place, which prevented the sowing in the autumn of 713."

[Isa 38:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#007.md)

On [Kg2 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#009.md) - Even הלך is
syntactically admissible in the sense of iveritne; see [Gen
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007.md); [Psa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003.md); [Job
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009.md).

[Isa 47:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#012.md)

ἀλμενιχακά in Plut., read Porph., viz., in the letter of Porphyrios to
the Egyptian Anebo in Euseb. praep. iii. 4, init.: τάς τε εἰς τοὺς
δεκανοὺς τομὰς καὶ τοὺς ὡροσκόποὺς καὶ τοὺς λεγομένους κραταιοὺς
ἡγεμόνας, ὧν καὶ ὀνόματα ἐν τοῖς ἀλμενιχιακοῖς φέρεται; compare
Jamblichos, de Mysteriis, viii. 4: τά τε ἑν τοῖς σαλμεσχινιακοῖς μέρος
τι βραχύτατον περιέχει τῶν ̔Ερμαικῶν διατάξεων. This reading
σαλμεσχινιακοῖς has been adopted by Parthey after two codices and the
text in Salmasius, de annis clim. 605. But ἀλμενιχιακοῖς is favoured by
the form Almanach (Hebr. אלמנק, see Steinschneider, Catal. Codd.
Lugduno-Batav. p. 370), in which the word was afterwards adopted as the
name of an astrological handbook or year-book. In Arabic the word
appears to me to be equivalent to 'l-mnâch, the encampment (of the
stars); but to all appearance it was originally an Egyptian word, and
possibly the Coptic monk (old Egyptian mench), a form or thing formed,
is hidden beneath it.

[Isa 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010.md)

נואשׁ - Fleischer says: "Just as in Arabic 'ml and rj' the meaning of
hope springs out of the idea of stretching and drawing out, so do Arabic
ayisa and ya'isa (spem deposuit, desperavit) signify literally to draw
in, to compress; hence the old Arabic ya'asun = sillun, consumption,
phthisis. And the other old Arabic word waysun, lit., squeezing, res
angustae = fakr wa-faka, want, need, and penury, or in a concrete sense
the need, or thing needed, is also related to this."

[Isa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011.md)

Μήνη appears in μηναγύρθς = μητραγύρθς as the name of Cybele, the mother
of the gods. In Egyptian, Menhi is a form of Isis in the city of
Hat-uer. The Ithyphallic Min, the cognomen of Amon, which is often
written in an abbreviated form with the spelling men (Copt. MHIN,
signum), is further removed.

[Isa 65:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#023.md)

לבּהלה. Fleischer says: "בּהל and Arabic bahala are so far connected,
that the stem בהל, like בלהּ, signifies primarily to let loose, or let
go. This passes over partly into outward overtaking or overturning, and
partly into internal surprise and bewildering, and partly also (in
Arabic) into setting free on the one hand, and outlawing on the other
(compare the Azazel-goat of the day of atonement, which was sent away
into the wilderness); hence it is used as an equivalent for Arabic
la‛ana (execrare)."
