### [Psalms Chapter 108](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

Two Elohimic Fragments Brought Together

The אודך in [Psa 108:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#004.md) and the whole
contents of this Psalm is the echo to the הודוּ of the preceding Psalm.
It is inscribed a Psalm-song by David, but only because it is compiled
out of ancient Davidic materials. The fact of the absence of the למנצח
makes it natural to suppose that it is of later origin. Two Davidic
Psalm-pieces in the Elohimic style are here, with trifling variations,
just put together, not soldered together, and taken out of their
original historical connection.

That a poet like David would thus compile a third out of two of his own
songs (Hengstenberg) is not conceivable.

[Psalms 108:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 108:1</span></span>

This first half is taken from Ps. 57:8-12. The repetition of confident
is my heart in [Psa 57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md) is here
omitted; and in place of it the "my glory" of the exclamation, awake my
glory, is taken up to "I will sing and will harp" as a more minute
definition of the subject (vid., on [Psa
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005).md): He will do it, yea,his soul with
all its godlike powers shall do it. Jahve in [Psa
108:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#004.md) is transformed out of the
Adonaj; and Waw copul. is inserted both before [Psa
108:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#004.md) and [Psa
108:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006.md), contrary to [Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md). מעל, [Psa
108:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#005.md) (as in [Est
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001).md), would be a pleasing change for
עד if [Psa 108:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#005.md) followed [Psa
108:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#005.md) and the definition of magnitude
did not retrograde instead of heightening. Moreover [Psa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006.md); [Jer
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009.md) (cf. על in [Psa
113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004.md); [Psa
148:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#013).md) favour עד in opposition to
מעל.

[Psalms 108:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 108:6</span></span>

Ps. 60:7-14 forms this second half. The clause expressing the purpose
with למען, as in its original, has the following הושׁיעה for its
principal clause upon which it depends. Instead of ועננוּ, which one
might have expected, the expression used here is וענני without any
interchange of the mode of writing and of reading it; many printed
copies have ועננו here also; Baer, following Norzi, correctly has וענני.
Instead of ולי...לי, [Psa 60:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009.md), we
here read לי...לי, which is less soaring. And instead of Cry aloud
concerning me, O Philistia do I shout for joy (the triumphant cry of the
victor); in accordance with which Hupfeld wishes to take התרועעי in the
former as infinitive: "over (עלי instead of עלי) Philistia is my
shouting for joy" (התרועעי instead of התרועעי, since the infinitive does
not admit of this pausal form of the imperative). For עיר מצור we have
here the more usual form of expression עיר מבצר. [Psa
108:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#012.md) is weakened by the omission of
the אתּה (הלא).
