III\. The Way to Salvation - Micah 6 and 7

Micah having declared to the people of Israel not only the judgment that
will burst upon Zion on account of its sins, but also the salvation
awaiting in the future the remnant saved and purified through the
judgment, now proceeds, in the third and last address, to point out the
way to salvation, by showing that they bring punishment upon themselves
by their ingratitude and resistance to the commandments of God, and that
it is only through sincere repentance that they can participate in the
promised covenant mercies.

Exhortation to Repentance, and Divine Threatening - Micah 6

In the form of a judicial contest between the Lord and His people, the
prophet holds up before the Israelites their ingratitude for the great
blessings which they have received from God ([Mic
6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001).md), and teaches them that the Lord
does not require outward sacrifices to appease His wrath, but
righteousness, love, and humble walk with God ([Mic
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006).md), and that He must inflict
severe punishment, because the people practise violence, lying, and
deceit instead ([Mic 6:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009).md).

[Micah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 6:1</span></span>

Introduction. - Announcement of the lawsuit which the Lord will have
with His people. - [Mic 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md). "Hear ye,
then, what Jehovah saith; Rise up, contend with the mountains, and let
the hills hear thy voice! [Mic 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002.md).
Hear ye, O mountains, Jehovah's contest; and ye immutable ones, ye
foundations of the earth! For Jehovah has a contest with His people; and
with Israel will He contend." In [Mic
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md) the nation of Israel is addressed
in its several members. They are to hear what the Lord says to the
prophet, - namely, the summons addressed to the mountains and hills to
hear Jehovah's contest with His people. The words "strive with the
mountains" cannot be understood here as signifying that the mountains
are the objects of the accusation, notwithstanding the fact that ריב
את־פ signifies to strive or quarrel with a person ([Jdg
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md); [Isa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008.md); [Jer
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009).md); for, according to [Mic
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002.md), they are to hear the contest of
Jehovah with Israel, and therefore are to be merely witnesses on the
occasion. Consequently את can only express the idea of fellowship here,
and ריב את must be distinguished from ריב עם in [Mic
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002.md) and [Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md), etc. The mountains and hills are
to hearken to the contest (as in [Deu
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001.md) and [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002).md), as witnesses, "who have seen
what the Lord has done for Israel throughout the course of ages, and how
Israel has rewarded Him for it all" (Caspari), to bear witness on behalf
of the Lord, and against Israel. Accordingly the mountains are called
האתנים, the constantly enduring, immutable ones, which have been
spectators from time immemorial, and מוסדי ארץ, foundations of the
earth, as being subject to no change on account of their strength and
firmness. In this respect they are often called "the everlasting
mountains" (e.g., [Gen 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#026.md); [Deu
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#015.md); [Psa
90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002.md); [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006).md). Israel is called ̀‛ammı̄
(Jehovah's people) with intentional emphasis, not only to indicate the
right of Jehovah to contend with it, but to sharpen its own conscience,
by pointing to its calling. Hithvakkach, like hivvâkhach in the niphal
in [Isa 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md).

[Micah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 6:3</span></span>

[Mic 6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md) open the suit. [Mic
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md). "My people! what have I done unto
thee, and with what have I wearied thee? Answer me. [Mic
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004.md). Yea, I have brought thee up out
of the land of Egypt, redeemed thee out of the slave-house, and sent
before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. [Mic
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005.md). My people! remember now what
Balak the king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor
answered him from Shittim to Gilga; that thou mayest discern the
righteous acts of Jehovah." The Lord opens the contest with the
question, what He has done to the nation, that it has become tired of
Him. The question is founded upon the fact that Israel has fallen away
from its God, or broken the covenant. This is not distinctly stated,
indeed; but it is clearly implied in the expression הלאתיך, What have I
done, that thou hast become weary of me? לאה, in the hiphil, to make a
person weary, more particularly to weary the patience of a person,
either by demands of too great severity ([Isa
43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023).md), or by failing to perform one's
promises ([Jer 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031).md). ענה בי, answer
against me, i.e., accuse me. God has done His people no harm, but has
only conferred benefits upon them. Of these He mentions in [Mic
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004.md) the bringing up out of Egypt and
the guidance through the Arabian desert, as being the greatest
manifestations of divine grace, to which Israel owes its exaltation into
a free and independent nation (cf. [Amo
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#010.md) and [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006)). The kı̄ (for.md) may be explained
from the unexpressed answer to the questions in [Mic
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md) : "Nothing that could cause
dissatisfaction with me;" for I have done nothing but confer benefits
upon thee. To set forth the leading up out of Egypt as such a benefit,
it is described as redemption out of the house of bondage, after [Exo
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002.md). Moreover, the Lord had given His
people prophets, men entrusted with His counsels and enlightened by His
Spirit, as leaders into the promised land: viz., Moses, with whom He
talked mouth to mouth, as a friend to his friend ([Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008).md); and Aaron, who was not only
able as high priest to ascertain the counsel and will of the Lord for
the sake of the congregation, by means of the "light and right," but who
also, along with Moses, represented the nation before God ([Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md); [Num
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005.md), [Num
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#026.md); [Num
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#020.md); [Num
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#007) ff., and 29.md). Miriam, the sister
of the two, is also mentioned along with them, inasmuch as she too was a
prophetess ([Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020).md). In [Mic
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005.md) God also reminds them of the other
great display of grace, viz., the frustration of the plan formed by the
Moabitish king Balak to destroy Israel by means of the curses of Balaam
(Numbers 22-24). יעץ refers to the plan which Balak concocted with the
elders of Midian ([Num 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#003) ff..md); and
ענה, Balaam's answering, to the sayings which this soothsayer was
compelled by divine constraint to utter against his will, whereby, as
Moses says in [Deu 23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#005.md), the Lord
turned the intended curse into a blessing. The words "from Shittim
(Israel's last place of encampment beyond Jordan, in the steppes of
Moab; see at [Num 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001.md) and [Num
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001).md) to Gilgal" (the first place of
encampment in the land of Canaan; see at [Jos
4:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019.md), and [Jos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009).md) do not depend upon זכר־נא, adding
a new feature to what has been mentioned already, in the sense of "think
of all that took place from Shittim to Gilgal," in which case זכר־נא
would have to be repeated in thought; but they are really attached to
the clause וּמה עבה וגו, and indicate the result, or the confirmation of
Balaam's answer. The period of Israel's journeying from Shittim to
Gilgal embraces not only Balak's advice and Balaam's answer, by which
the plan invented for the destruction of Israel was frustrated, but also
the defeat of the Midianites, who attempted to destroy Israel by
seducing it to idolatry, the miraculous crossing of the Jordan, the
entrance into the promised land, and the circumcision at Gilgal, by
which the generation that had grown up in the desert was received into
the covenant with Jehovah, and the whole nation reinstated in its normal
relation to its God. Through these acts the Lord had actually put to
shame the counsel of Balak, and confirmed the fact that Balaam's answer
was inspired by God.

(Note: With this view, which has already been suggested by Hengstenberg,
the objections offered by Ewald, Hitzig, and others, to the genuineness
of the words "from Shittim to Gilgal," the worthlessness of which has
been demonstrated by Caspari, fall to the ground.)

By these divine acts Israel was to discern the tsidqōth Yehōvâh; i.e.,
not the mercies of Jehovah, for tsedâqâh does not mean mercy, but "the
righteous acts of Jehovah," as in [Jdg
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#011.md) and [Sa1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#007.md). This term is applied to those
miraculous displays of divine omnipotence in and upon Israel, for the
fulfilment of His counsel of salvation, which, as being emanations of
the divine covenant faithfulness, attested the righteousness of Jehovah.

[Micah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 6:6</span></span>

Israel cannot deny these gracious acts of its God. The remembrance of
them calls to mind the base ingratitude with which it has repaid its God
by rebelling against Him; so that it inquires, in [Mic
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md), [Mic
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007.md), with what it can appease the
Lord, i.e., appease His wrath. [Mic
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md). "Wherewith shall I come to meet
Jehovah, bow myself before the God of the high place? Shall I come to
meet Him with burnt-offerings, with yearling calves? [Mic
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007.md). Will Jehovah take pleasure in
thousands of rams, in ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give up my
first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my
soul?" As Micah has spoken in [Mic
6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md) in the name of Jehovah, he now
proceeds, in [Mic 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md), [Mic
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007.md), to let the congregation speak;
not, however, by turning directly to God, since it recognises itself as
guilty before Him, but by asking the prophet, as the interpreter of the
divine will, what it is to do to repair the bond of fellowship which has
been rent in pieces by its guilt. קדּם does not here mean to anticipate,
or come before, but to come to meet, as in [Deu
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#005.md). Coming to meet, however, can
only signify humble prostration (kâphaph) before the divine majesty. The
God of the high place is the God dwelling in the high place ([Isa
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#005.md); [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015).md), or enthroned in heaven ([Psa
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003).md). It is only with sacrifices,
the means appointed by God Himself for the maintenance of fellowship
with Him, that any man can come to meet Him. These the people offer to
bring; and, indeed, burnt-offerings. There is no reference here to
sin-offerings, through which disturbed or interrupted fellowship could
be restored, by means of the expiation of their sins; because the people
had as yet no true knowledge of sin, but were still living under the
delusion that they were standing firmly in the covenant with the Lord,
which they themselves had practically dissolved. As burnt-offerings,
they would bring calves and rams, not because they formed the only
material, but because they were the material most usually employed; and,
indeed, calves of a year old, because they were regarded as the best,
not because no others were allowed to be offered, as Hitzig erroneously
maintains; for, according to the law, calves and lambs could be offered
in sacrifice even when they were eight days old ([Lev
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#027.md); [Exo
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029).md). In the case of the calves the
value is heightened by the quality, in that of the rams by the quantity:
thousands of rams; and also myriads of rivers of oil (for this
expression, compare [Job 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#017).md). Oil
not only formed part of the daily minchah, but of the minchah generally,
which could not be omitted from any burnt-offerings (compare Numbers
15:1-16 with ch. 28 and 29), so that it was offered in very large
quantities. Nevertheless, in the consciousness that these sacrifices
might not be sufficient, the people would offer the dearest thing of
all, viz., the first-born son, as an expiation for their sin. This offer
is founded, no doubt, upon the true idea that sacrifice shadows forth
the self-surrender of man to God, and that an animal is not a sufficient
substitute for a man; but this true idea was not realized by literal
(bodily) human sacrifices: on the contrary, it was turned into an
ungodly abomination, because the surrender which God desires is that of
the spirit, not of the flesh. Israel could and should have learned this,
not only from the sacrifice of Isaac required by God (Genesis 22), but
also from the law concerning the consecration or sanctification of the
first-born ([Exo 13:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012).md). Hence this
offer of the nation shows that it has no true knowledge of the will of
its God, that it is still entangled in the heathen delusion, that the
wrath of God can be expiated by human sacrifices (cf. [Kg2
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027.md); [Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003).md).

[Micah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 6:8</span></span>

The prophet therefore proceeds in [Mic
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008.md) to overthrow these outward means
of reconciliation with God, and reminds the people of the moral demands
of the law. [Mic 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008.md). "They have told
thee, O man, what is good, and what Jehovah requires of thee, simply to
do right, and love good, and walk humbly with thy God." הגּיד,
impersonal, "one has told," or they have told thee, namely Moses in the
law. The opinion that Jehovah should be supplied as the subject is a
very improbable one, for the simple reason that Jehovah is expressly
mentioned in the second dependent clause. The use of כּי אם, nisi, as in
the similar connection of thought in [Deu
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012.md), may be accounted for from the
retrospective allusion to the gifts mentioned by the people: not outward
sacrifices of any kind, but only the fulfilment of three following
duties: namely, above all things, doing righteousness and exercising
love. These two embrace all the commandments of the second table, of
whose fulfilment Israel thought so little, that it was addicted to the
very opposite, - namely, injustice, oppression, and want of affection
(vid., [Mic 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md), [Mic
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008.md); [Mic
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002.md), [Mic
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009.md) ff., [Mic
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010) ff..md). There is also a third:
humble walk with God, i.e., in fellowship with God, as Israel, being a
holy priestly nation, ought to walk. Without these moral virtues,
sacrificial worship was a spiritless opus operatum, in which God had no
pleasure (see at [Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md) and [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006).md).

[Micah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 6:9</span></span>

But because Israel is altogether wanting in these virtues, the Lord must
threaten and punish. [Mic 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009.md). "The
voice of Jehovah, to the city it cries, and wisdom has thy name in its
eye; hear ye the rod, and who appoints it!" With these words Micah
introduces the threatening and reproachful words of the Lord. קוך יהוה
is not to be taken by itself, as an exclamation, "Hark! voice of the
Lord!" as in [Isa 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004.md); [Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006), etc. (Umbreit.md), but must be
connected with what follows, in accordance with the accents. Whilst the
prophet tells the people in [Isa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#008.md)
what Jehovah requires, he introduces the following threat with "voice of
Jehovah," etc., to give the greater emphasis to the reproof, by
intimating that it is not his own voice, but Jehovah's, which is
speaking now. "To the city," i.e., to the chief city of the kingdom,
viz., Jerusalem. The sentence which follows, and which has been
explained in very different ways, has the same object. תּוּשׁיּה, a word
borrowed from the Chokmah-literature (Proverbs and Job), both here and
[Isa 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029.md), formed from ישׁ or the
root ושׁי (ושׁה), in the sense of subsistentia, substantia, then mostly
vera et realis sapientia (see Delitzsch on [Job
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#003).md). יראה שׁמך is taken by many as a
relative clause, "Blessed is he who sees Thy name," i.e., gives heed to
Thy revelation, Thy government of the universe; but if this were the
sense, the relative could not have been omitted, or the infinitive ראת
must have been used. תּוּשׁיּה is rather to be taken as the object, and
שׁמך as the subject: Thy name sees wisdom, i.e., has the true wisdom of
life in sight (ראה as in [Gen 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#010.md)
and [Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018).md). There is no necessity
for the conjecture יראה for יראה (Ewald and Hitzig); and notwithstanding
the fact that ירא is adopted in all the ancient versions, it is
unsuitable, since the thought "wisdom is to fear Thy name" would be a
very strange one in this connection, unless we could paraphrase the name
into "word of the person speaking." For other explanations, see Caspari.
Hear ye, i.e., observe, the rod, viz., the judgment threatened by the
Lord, and appointed for His rebellious nation. The reference is to the
imperial power of Assyria, which Isaiah also describes in [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md), [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md), as the matteh and shēbhet by
which Israel is smitten. The suffix to יעדהּ refers to שׁבט, which is
construed here as a feminine; יעד denotes the appointment of an
instrument of punishment, as in [Jer
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#007.md).

[Micah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 6:10</span></span>

The threatening words commence in [Mic
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md); [Mic
6:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md) containing a condemnation of
the prevailing sins. [Mic 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md). "Are
there yet in the house of the unjust treasures of injustice, and the
ephah of consumption, the cursed one? [Mic
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#011.md). Can I be clean with the scale of
injustice, and with a purse with stones of deceit? [Mic
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012.md). That their rich men are full of
wickedness, and their inhabitants speak deceit, and their tongue is
falseness in their mouth." The reproof is dressed up in the form of a
question. In the question in [Mic 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md)
the emphasis is laid upon the עוד, which stands for that very reason
before the interrogative particle, as in [Gen
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#012.md), the only other place in which
this occurs. אשׁ, a softened form for ישׁ, as in [Sa2
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#019.md). Treasures of wickedness are
treasures acquired through wickedness or acts of injustice. The meaning
of the question is not, Are the unjust treasures not yet removed out of
the house, not yet distributed again? but, as [Mic
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md) and [Mic
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#011.md) require, Does the wicked man
still bring such treasures into the house? does he still heap up such
treasures in his house? The question is affirmative, and the form of a
question is chosen to sharpen the conscience, as the unjust men to whom
it is addressed cannot deny it. איפת רזון, ephah of consumption or
hungriness, analogous to the German expression "a hungry purse," is too
small an ephah (cf. [Deu 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#014.md); [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005).md); the opposite of א שׁלמה ([Deu
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#015).md) or א צדק ([Lev
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036).md), which the law prescribed.
Hence Micah calls it זעוּמה = זעוּם יהוה in [Pro
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014.md), that which is smitten by the
wrath of God (equivalent to cursed; cf. [Num
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md); [Pro
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#024).md). Whoever has not a full ephah
is, according to [Deu 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#016.md), an
abomination to the Lord. If these questions show the people that they do
not answer to the demands made by the Lord in [Mic
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008.md), the questions in [Mic
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#011.md) also teach that, with this state
of things, they cannot hold themselves guiltless. The speaker inquires,
from the standpoint of his own moral consciousness, whether he can be
pure, i.e., guiltless, if he uses deceitful scales and weights, - a
question to which every one must answer No. It is difficult, however, to
decide who the questioner is. As [Mic
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009.md) announces words of God, and in
[Mic 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md) God is speaking, and also in
[Mic 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012.md), [Mic
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013.md), it appears as though Jehovah
must be the questioner here. But אזכּה does not tally with this. Jerome
therefore adopts the rendering numquid justificabo stateram impiam; but
זכה in the kal has only the meaning to be pure, and even in the piel it
is not used in the sense of niqqh, to acquit. This latter fact is
sufficient to overthrow the proposal to alter the reading into piel.
Moreover, "the context requires the thought that the rich men fancy they
can be pure with deceitful weights, and a refutation of this delusive
idea" (Caspari). Consequently the prophet only can raise this question,
namely as the representative of the moral consciousness; and we must
interpret this transition, which is so sudden and abrupt to our ears, by
supplying the thought, "Let every one ask himself," Can I, etc. Instead
of רשׁע we have the more definite mirmh in the parallel clause. Scales
and a bag with stones belong together; 'ăbhanı̄m are the stone weights
(cf. [Lev 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036.md); [Deu
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013).md) which were carried in a bag
([Pro 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011).md). In [Mic
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012.md) the condemnation of injustice is
widened still further. Whereas in the first clause the rich men of the
capital (the suffix pointing back to עיר in [Mic
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009).md), who are also to be thought of in
[Mic 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md), are expressly mentioned, in
the second clause the inhabitants generally are referred to. And whilst
the rich are not only charged with injustice or fraud in trade, but with
châmâs, violence of every kind, the inhabitants are charged with lying
and deceit of the tongue. Leshōnâm (their tongue) is not placed at the
head absolutely, in the sense of "As for their tongue, deceit is," etc.
Such an emphasis as this is precluded by the fact that the preceding
clause, "speaking lies," involves the use of the tongue. Leshōnâm is the
simple subject: Their tongue is deceit or falsehood in their mouth;
i.e., their tongue is so full of deceit, that it is, so to speak,
resolved into it. Both clauses express the thought, that "the
inhabitants of Jerusalem are a population of liars and cheats" (Hitzig).
The connection in which the verse stands, or the true explanation of
אשׁר, has been a matter of dispute. We must reject both the combination
of [Mic 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012.md) and [Mic
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013.md) ("Because their rich men, etc.,
therefore I also," etc.), and also the assumption that [Mic
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012.md) contains the answer to the
question in [Mic 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md), and that אשׁר
precedes the direct question (Hitzig): the former, because [Mic
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012.md) obviously forms the conclusion to
the reproof, and must be separated from what precedes it; the latter,
because the question in [Mic 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#011.md)
stands between [Mic 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md) and [Mic
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012.md), which is closely connected with
[Mic 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md), and [Mic
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012.md) also contains no answer to [Mic
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md), so far as the thought is
concerned, even if the latter actually required an answer. We must
rather take אשׁר as a relative, as Caspari does, and understand the
verse as an exclamation, which the Lord utters in anger over the city:
"She, whose rich men are full," etc. "Angry persons generally prefer to
speak of those who have excited their wrath, instead of addressing their
words to them."

[Micah 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 6:13</span></span>

The threat of punishment follows in [Mic
6:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013.md). [Mic
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013.md). "So also now do I smite thee
incurably, laying waste because of thy sins. [Mic
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014.md). Thou wilt eat, and not be
satisfied; and thine emptiness remains in thee; and thou wilt remove,
and not save; and what thou savest I will give to the sword. [Mic
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#015.md). Thou wilt sow, and not reap;
thou wilt tread olives, and not anoint thyself with oil; new wine, and
not drink wine." With וגם־אני the threatened punishment is represented
as the consequence of, or retribution for, the sins of the people.
החליתי הך: literally, I have made the smiting thee sick, i.e., smitten
thee with incurable sickness (for hechelaah, see at [Nah
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#019.md) and [Jer
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#012.md); and for the fact itself, [Isa
1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005).md). The perfect expresses the
certainty of the future. The suffix refers to the people, not of the
capital only, but, as we may see from [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md), of the whole of the kingdom of
Judah. Hashmēm (an uncontracted form; see Ges. 67, Anm. 10), devastando,
is attached to the preceding verb in an adverbial sense, as a practical
exemplification, like the שׁבע in [Lev
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018.md), [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024.md), [Lev
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#028.md), which Micah had in his eye at
the time. For the individualizing of the punishment, which follows,
rests upon [Lev 26:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#025.md), and [Deu
28:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#039.md). The land is threatened with
devastation by the foe, from which the people flee into fortresses, the
besieging of which occasions starvation. For the fulfilment of this, see
[Jer 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006.md) (cf. [Kg2
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025).md). ישׁח, ἁπ.λεγ., hollowness, or
emptiness of stomach. ותסּג, thou mayest remove, i.e., carry off thy
goods and family, yet wilt thou not save; but even if thou shouldst save
anything, it will fall into the hands of the enemy, and be destroyed by
his sword (vid., [Jer 50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037).md). The
enemy will also partly consume and partly destroy the corn and
field-fruit, as well as the stores of oil and wine (vid., [Amo
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011).md). ולא תסוּך שׁמן is taken
verbatim from [Deu 28:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#040.md).

[Micah 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mic 6:16</span></span>

This trouble the people bring upon themselves by their ungodly conduct.
With this thought the divine threatening is rounded off and closed. [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md). "And they observe the statutes
of Omri, and all the doings of the house of Ahab, and so ye walk in
their counsels; that I may make thee a horror, and her inhabitants a
hissing, and the reproach of my people shall ye bear." The verse is
attached loosely to what precedes by Vav. The first half corresponds to
[Mic 6:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md), the second to [Mic
6:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013.md), and each has three clauses.
השׁתּמּר, as an intensive form of the piel, is the strongest expression
for שׁמר, and is not to be taken as a passive, as Ewald and others
suppose, but in a reflective sense: "It (or one) carefully observes for
itself the statutes of Omri instead of the statutes of the Lord" ([Lev
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#023.md); [Jer
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003).md). All that is related of Omri, is
that he was worse than all his predecessors ([Kg1
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#025).md). His statutes are the
Baal-worship which his son and successor Ahab raised into the ruling
national religion ([Kg1 16:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031).md), and
the introduction of which is attributed to Omri as the founder of the
dynasty. In the same sense is Athaliah, who was a daughter of Jezebel,
called a daughter of Omri in [Ch2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002.md). All the doing of the house of
Ahab: i.e., not only its Baal-worship, but also its persecution of the
Lord's prophets ([Kg1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004.md); [Kg1
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027).md), and the rest of its sins,
e.g., the robbery and murder committed upon Naboth (1 Kings 21). With
ותּלכוּ the description passes over into a direct address; not into the
preterite, however, for the imperfect with Vav rel. does not express
here what has been the custom in both the past and present, but is
simply the logical deduction from what precedes, "that which continually
occurs." The suffix attached to בּמעצותם refers to Ahab and Omri. By
למען the punishment is represented as intentionally brought about by the
sinners themselves, to give prominence to the daring with which men
lived on in godlessness and unrighteousness. In אתך the whole nation is
addressed: in the second clause, the inhabitants of the capital as the
principal sinners; and in the third, the nation again in its individual
members. שׁמּה does not mean devastation here; but in parallelism with
שׁרקה, horror, or the object of horror, as in [Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037.md); [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md); [Jer
51:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#037.md), and [Ch2
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#008.md). Cherpath ‛ammı̄: the shame which
the nation of God, as such, have to bear from the heathen, when they are
given up into their power (see [Eze
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020).md). This shame will have to be
borne by the several citizens, the present supporters of the idea of the
nation of God.
