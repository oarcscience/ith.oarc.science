### [Job Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001.md)

[Job 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 37:1</span></span>

1 Yea, at this my heart trembleth

And tottereth from its place.

2 Hear, O hear the roar of His voice,

And the murmur that goeth out of His mouth.

3 He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven,

And His lightning unto the ends of the earth.

4 After it roareth the voice of the thunder,

He thundereth with the voice of His majesty,

And spareth not the lightnings, when His voice is heard.

5 God thundereth with His voice marvellously,

Doing great things, incomprehensible to us.

Louis Bridel is perhaps right when he inserts after Job 36 the
observation: L'clair brille, la tonnerre gronde. לזאת does not refer to
the phenomenon of the storm which is represented in the mind, but to
that which is now to be perceived by the senses. The combination שׁמעוּ
שׁמוע can signify both hear constantly, [Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md), and hear attentively, [Job
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#017.md); here it is the latter. רגז of
thunder corresponds to the verbs Arab. rḥz and rjs, which can be
similarly used. The repetition of קול fo noititeper eh five times calls
to mind the seven קולות (ἑπτὰ βρονταί) in [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md). The parallel is הגה, [Job
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#002.md), a murmuring, as elsewhere of the
roar of the lion and the cooing of the dove. The suff. of ישׁרהוּ refers
to the thunder which rolls through the immeasurable breadth under
heaven; it is not perf. Piel of ישׁר (Schlottm.), for "to give definite
direction" ([Ch2 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030).md) is not
appropriate to thunder, but fut. Kal of שׁרה, to free, to unbind (Ew.,
Hirz. and most others). What [Job 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#003.md)
says of thunder, [Job 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#003.md) says of
light, i.e., the lightning: God sends it forth to the edges, πτέρυγες,
i.e., ends, of the earth. אחריו, [Job
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#004.md), naturally refers to the
lightning, which is followed by the roar of the thunder; and יעקּבם to
the flashes, which, when once its rumble is heard, God does not restrain
(עקּב = עכּב of the Targ., and Arab. ‛aqqaba, to leave behind,
postpone), but causes to flash forth in quick succession. Ewald's
translation: should He not find (prop. non investigaverit) them (the men
that are to be punished), gives a thought that has no support in this
connection. In [Job 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#005.md) נפלאות,
mirabilia, is equivalent to mirabiliter, as [Dan
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024.md), comp. [Psa
65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006.md); [Psa
139:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014.md). ולא נדע is intended to say
that God's mighty acts, with respect to the connection between cause and
effect and the employment of means, transcend our comprehension.

[Job 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 37:6</span></span>

6 For He saith to the snow: Fall towards the earth,

And to the rain-shower

And the showers of His mighty rain.

7 He putteth a seal on the hand of every man,

That all men may come to a knowledge of His creative work.

8 The wild beast creepeth into a hiding-place,

And in its resting-place it remaineth.

9 Out of the remote part cometh the whirlwind,

And cold from the cloud-sweepers.

10 From the breath of God cometh ice,

And the breadth of the waters is straitened.

Like אבי, [Job 34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036.md), and פּשׁ, [Job
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015.md), הוא, [Job
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md) (is falsely translated "be
earthwards" by lxx, Targ., and Syr.), also belongs to the most striking
Arabisms of the Elihu section: it signifies delabere (Jer. ut
descendat), a signification which the Arab. hawâ does not gain from the
radical signification placed first in Gesenius-Dietrich's Handwrterbuch,
to breathe, blow, but from the radical signification, to gape, yawn, by
means of the development of the meaning which also decides in favour of
the primary notion of the Hebr. הוּה, according to which, what was said
on [Job 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#002.md); [Job
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#013.md) is to be corrected.

(Note: Arab. hawâ is originally χαίνειν, to gape, yawn, hiare, e.g.,
hawat et-ta‛natu, the stab gapes (imperf. tahwı̂, inf. huwı̂jun), "when it
opens its mouth" - the Turkish Kamus adds, to complete the picture: like
a tulip. Thence next hâwijatun, χαίνουσα χαῖνον, i.e., χᾶσμα = hûwatun,
uhwı̂jatun, huwâatun, mahwâtun, a cleft, yawning deep, chasm, abyss,
βάραθρον, vorago; hawı̂jatun and hauhâtun (a reduplicated form),
especially a very deep pit or well. But these same words, hâwijatun,
hûwatun, uhwı̂jatun, mahwâtun, also signify, like the usual Arab.
hawa'â'un, the χάσμα between heaven and earth, i.e., the wide, empty
space, the same as 'gauwun. The wider significations, or rather
applications and references of hawâ: air set in motion, a current of
air, wind, weather, are all secondary, and related to that primary
signification as samâ, rain-clouds, rain, grass produced by the rain, to
the prim. signification height, heaven, vid., Mehren, Rhetorik d.
Araber, S. 107, Z. 14ff. This hawâ, however, also signifies in general:
a broad, empty space, and by transferring the notion of "empty" to mind
and heart, as the reduplicated forms hûhatun and hauhâtun: devoid of
understanding and devoid of courage, e.g., Koran xiv. 44:
wa-af'i-datuhum hawâun, where Bedhw first explains hawâ directly by
chalâ, emptiness, empty space, i.e., as he adds, châlijetun ‛an el-fahm,
as one says of one without mind and courage qalbuhu hawâun. Thence also
hauwun, emptiness, a hole, i.e., in a wall or roof, a dormar-window
(kauwe, kûwe), but also with the genit. of a person or thing: their
hole, i.e., the space left empty by them, the side not taken up by them,
e.g., qa‛ada fi hauwihi, he set himself beside him. From the
signification to be empty then comes (1) hawat el-mar'atu, i.e., vacua
fuit mulier = orba oiberis, as χήρα, vidua, properly empty, French vide;
(2) hawâ er-ragulu, i.e., vacuus, inanis factus est vir = exanimatus
(comp. Arab. frg, he became empty, euphemistic for he died).

From this variously applied primary signification is developed the
generally known and usual Arab. hawâ, loose and free, without being held
or holding to anything one's self, to pass away, fly, swing, etc.,
libere ferri, labi, in general in every direction, as the wind, or what
is driven hither and thither by the wind, especially however from above
downwards, labi, delabi, cadere, deorsum ruere. From this point, like
many similar, the word first passes into the signification of sound (as
certainly also שׁאה, שא): as anything falling has a full noise, and so
on, δουπεῖν, rumorem, fragorem edere (fragor from frangi), hence hawat
udhnuhu jawı̂jan of a singing in the ears.

Finally, the mental Arab. hawan (perf. hawija, imperf. jahwâ with the
acc.), animo ad or in aliquid ferri, is attached to the notion of
passing and falling through space (though by no means to hiare, or the
supposed meaning "to breathe, blow"). It is used both emotionally of
desire, lust, appetites, passions, and strong love, and intellectually
of free opinions or assertions springing from mere self-willed
preference, caprices of the understanding. - Fl.)

The ל of לשּׁלג influences [Job 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md)
also. The Hebr. name for rain, גּשׁם (cogn. with Chald. גשׁם, Arab.
gism, a body), denotes the rain collectively. The expression [Job
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md) is exceeded in [Job
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md), where מטרות does not signify
rain-drops (Ew.), but, like the Arab. amtr, rain-showers. The wonders of
nature during the rough season (חרף, סתיו, [Sol
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011).md), between the autumnal and vernal
equinoxes, are meant; the rains after the autumnal equinox (the early
rain), which begin the season, and the rains before the vernal equinox
(the late rain, [Zac 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001).md), which
close it, with the falls of snow between, which frequently produce great
desolation, especially the proper winter with its frosty winds and heavy
showers, when the business of the husbandmen as of the nomads is brought
to a stand-still, and every one retreats to his house or seeks a
sheltering corner.

This is the meaning of [Job 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#007.md) : He
sealeth up (חתם בּ as [Job 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016).md) the
hand of all men that they cannot, viz., on account of the cold out of
doors, be opened for work, that all people of His work (i.e., thanking
Him for their origin as His handiwork, [Job
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019).md) may come to the perception (of
Him who doeth all things). The expression is remarkable, and by the
insertion of a m may be as easily cleared up as [Job
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017.md) : לדעת כּל־אנשׁים מעשׂהוּ, in
order that each and every one may acknowledge His work; after which even
Jer. translates: ut noverint singuli opera sua. The conjecture אנשׁים
עשׂהוּ (Schultens junior, Reiske, Hirz.) is inferior to the former
(Olsh.) by its awkward synecdoche num. The fut. consec. in [Job
37:8](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#008.md) continues the description of what
happens in consequence of the cold rainy season; the expression calls to
mind [Psa 104:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#022.md), as [Job
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014.md). does [Psa
104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029.md). The winter is also the time of
the stormy and raw winds. In [Job 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#009.md)
Elihu means the storms which come across from the great wide desert,
[Job 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019.md), therefore the south ([Isa
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md); [Zac
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#014).md), or rather south-east winds
([Hos 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015).md), increasing in violence
to storms. החדר (properly the surrounded, enclosed space, never the
storehouse, - so that [Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007.md)
should be compared, - but adytum, penetrale, as Arab. chidr, e.g., in
Vita Timuri ii. 904: after the removal of the superincumbent earth, they
drew away sitr chidrihâ, the curtain of its innermost part, i.e.,
uncovered its lowest depth) is here the innermost part of the south
(south-east), - comp. [Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md) חדרי
תימן, and [Job 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009.md) יעטף ימין (so far
as יעטף there signifies si operiat se), - especially of the great desert
lying to the south (south-east), according to which ארץ חדרך, [Zac
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md), is translated by the Targ. דרומא
ארעא. In opposition to the south-east wind, מזרים, [Job
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#009.md), seems to mean the north winds;
in and of itself, however, the word signifies the scattering or driving,
as also in the Koran the winds are called the scatterers, dhârijât, Sur.
li. 1.

(Note: This dhârijât is also differently explained; but the first
explanation in Beidhwi (ii. 183, Fleischer's edition) is, "the winds
which scatter (blow away) the dust and other things.")

In מזרים, Reiske, without any ground for it, traces the Arab. mirzam (a
name of two stars, from which north wind, rain, and cold are derived);
the Targ. also has one of the constellations in view: מכּוּת מזרים (from
the window, i.e., the window of the vault of heaven, of the mezarim);
Aq., Theod. ἀπὸ μαζούρ (= מזרות, [Job
38:32](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#032).md); lxx ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν ἀκρωτηρίων, we
know not wherefore. Concerning מנּשׁמת־אל (with causal מן) with
reference to the wind, vid., on [Job
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#015.md). יתּן, it gives, i.e., comes to
light, is used as in [Gen 38:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#028.md); [Pro
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010.md). The idea of מוּצק (not fusum
from יצק, but coarctatum from צוּק) cannot be doubtful in connection
with the antithesis of רחב, comp. [Job
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016.md), the idea is like [Job
38:30](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#030.md) (comp. Mutenebbi: "the flood is
bound by bands of ice"); the בּ of בּמוּצק is, as [Job
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032.md), the Beth essentiae, used far
more extensively in Hebr. than in Arab. as an exponent of the predicate:
the breadth of the water is (becomes) straitened (forcibly drawn
together).

[Job 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 37:11</span></span>

11 Also He loadeth the clouds with water,

He spreadeth far and wide the cloud of His light,

12 And these turn themselves round about,

Directed by Him, that they execute

All that He hath commanded them

Over the wide earth.

13 Whether for a scourge, or for the good of His earth,

Or for mercy, He causeth it to discharge itself.

With אף extending the description, Elihu, in the presence of the storm
that is in the sky, continually returns to this one marvel of nature.
The old versions connect בּרי partly with בּר, electus (lxx, Syr.,
Theod.) or frumentum (Symm., Jer.), partly with בּרה = בּרר in the
signification puritas, serenitas (Targ.); but בּרי is, as Schultens has
already perceived, the Hebr.-Arabic רי, Arab. rı̂yun, rı̂j-un (from רוה =
riwj), abundant irrigation, with בּ; and יטריח does not signify,
according to the Arab. atraha, "to hurl down," so that what is spoken of
would be the bursting of the clouds (Stick.),

(Note: This "atraha" is, moreover, a pure invention of our ordinary
Arabic lexicons instead of ittaraha (VIII form): (1) to throw one's
self, (2) to throw anything from one's self, with an acc. of the thing.
- Fl.)

but, according to טרח, a burden (comp. Arab. taraha ala, to load), "to
burden;" with fluidity (Ew., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm.), better: fulness of
water, He burdens the clouds (comp. rawij-un as a designation of cloud
as the place of rain). ענן אורו, His cloud of light, is that that is
charged with lightning, and הפיץ has here its Hebr.-Arab. radical
signification effundere, diffundere, with a preponderance of the idea
not of scattering, but of spreading out wide (Arab. faid, abundance).
והוּא, [Job 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#012.md), refers to the cloud
pregnant with lightning; this turns round about (מסבּות, adv. as מסב,
round about, [Kg1 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029).md) seeking a
place, where it shall unburden itself by virtue of His (God's) direction
or disposing (תחבּוּלת, a word belonging to the book of Proverbs; lxx,
Cod. Vat. and Alex., untranslated: εν θεεβουλαθωθ, Cod. Sinait. still
more monstrous), in order that they (the clouds full of lightning) may
accomplish everything that He commands them over the surface of the
earth; ארצה as [Job 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013.md), and the
combination תּבל ארצה as [Pro 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031.md),
comp. ארץ ותבל, [Psa 90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002.md). The
reference of the pronominal suff. to men is as inadmissible here as in
[Job 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#004.md). In [Job
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#013.md) two אם have certainly, as [Job
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md), two ו, the correlative
signification sive ... sive (Arab. in ... wa-in), in a third, as
appears, a conditional, but which? According to Ew., Hirz., Hahn,
Schlottm., and others, the middle one: if it (the rod) belongs to His
land, i.e., if it has deserved it. But even the possessive suff. of
לארצו shows that the ל is to be taken as dat. commodi: be it for a rod,
be it for the good of His land; which is then followed by a conditional
verbal clause: in case He mercifully causes it (the storm) to come,
i.e., causes this His land to be overtaken by it (המציא here with the
acc., the thing coming, whereas in [Job
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#011) of the thing to be overtaken.md).
The accentuation, indeed, appears to assume a threefold sive: whether He
causeth it to discharge itself upon man for punishment, man for mercy,
or His earth for good with reference to man. Then Elihu would think of
the uninhabited steppe in connection with אם לארצו. Since a conditional
אם by the side of two correlatives is hazardous, we decide finally with
the lxx, Targ., and all the old versions, in favour of the same
rendering of the threefold אם, especially since it corresponds to the
circumstances of the case.

[Job 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 37:14</span></span>

14 Hearken unto this, O Job;

Stand still and consider the wonderful works of God!

15 Dost thou know when God designeth

To cause the light of His clouds to shine?

16 Dost thou understand the balancings of the clouds,

The wondrous things of Him who is perfect in knowledge?

Job is to stand still, instead of dictating to God, in order to draw
from His wondrous acts in nature a conclusion with reference to his
mystery of suffering. In [Job 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015.md)
ידע בּ does not, as [Job 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015.md) (Ew.
217, S. 557), belong together, but בּ is the temporal Beth. שׂוּם is
equivalent to שׂים לבּו (vid., on [Job
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023).md); עליהם does not refer to נפלאות
(Hirz.) or the phenomena of the storm (Ew.), but is intended as neuter
(as בּם [Job 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031.md), בּהם [Job
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021).md), and finds in [Job
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015.md) its distinctive development:
"the light of His clouds" is their effulgent splendour. Without further
support, ידע על is to have knowledge concerning anything, [Job
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016.md); מפלשׂי is also ἁπ. γεγρ.. It is
unnecessary to consider it as wrongly written from מפרשׂי, [Job
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029.md), or as from it by change of
letter (as אלמנות = ארמנות, [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022).md). The verb פּלּס signifies to
make level, prepare (viz., a way, also weakened: to take a certain way,
[Pro 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006).md), once: to weigh, [Psa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003.md), as denom. from פּלס, a balance
(and indeed a steelyard, statera), which is thus mentioned as the means
of adjustment. מפלשׂי accordingly signifies either, as synon. of משׁקלי
(thus the Midrash, vid., Jalkut, 522), weights (the relations of
weight), or even equipoised balancings (Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, and others),
Lat. quomodo librentur nubes in are.

(Note: The word is therefore a metaphor taken from the balance, and it
may be observed that the Syro-Arabic, on account of the most extensive
application of the balance, is unusually rich in such metaphors.
Moreover, the Arabic has no corresponding noun: the teflı̂s (a balance)
brought forward by Ges. in his Thes. and Handwrterbuch from Schindler's
Pentaglotton, is a word devoid of all evidence from original sources and
from the modern usage of the language, in this signification.)

מפלאות is also a word that does not occur elsewhere; in like manner דּע
belongs exclusively to Elihu. God is called תּמים דּעים (comp. [Job
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#004).md) as the Omniscient One, whose
knowledge is absolute as to its depth as well as its circumference.

[Job 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 37:17</span></span>

17 Thou whose garments became hot,

When the land is sultry from the south:

18 Dost thou with Him spread out the sky,

The strong, as it were molten, mirror?

19 Let us know what we shall say to Him! -

We can arrange nothing by reason of darkness.

20 Shall it be told Him that I speak,

Or shall one wish to be destroyed?

Most expositors connect [Job 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#017.md)
with [Job 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016) : (Dost thou know.md) how
it comes to pass that ... ; but אשׁר after ידע signifies quod, [Exo
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007.md), not quomodo, as it sometimes
occurs in a comparing antecedent clause, instead of כאשׁר, [Exo
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013.md); [Jer
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#022.md). We therefore translate: thou
whose ... , - connecting this, however, not with [Job
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016) (vid., e.g., Carey.md), but as
Bolduc. and Ew., with [Job 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md)
(where ה before תרקיע is then the less missed): thou who, when the land
(the part of the earth where thou art) keeps rest, i.e., in sultriness,
when oppressive heat comes (on this Hiph. vid., Ges. 53, 2) from the
south (i.e., by means of the currents of air which come thence, without
דּרום signifying directly the south wind), - thou who, when this
happens, canst endure so little, that on the contrary the heat from
without becomes perceptible to thee through thy clothes: dost thou now
and then with Him keep the sky spread out, which for firmness is like a
molten mirror? Elsewhere the hemispheric firmament, which spans the
earth with its sub-celestial waters, is likened to a clear sapphire [Exo
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010.md), a covering [Psa
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002.md), a gauze [Isa
40:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022.md); the comparison with a metallic
mirror (מוּצק here not from צוּק, [Job
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#010.md); [Job
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016), but from יצק.md) is therefore to
be understood according to Petavius: Coelum areum στερέωμα dicitur non a
naturae propria conditione, sed ab effectu, quod perinde aquas separet,
ac si murus esset solidissimus. Also in תרקיע lies the notion both of
firmness and thinness; the primary notion (root רק) is to beat, make
thick, stipare (Arab. rq‛, to stop up in the sense of resarcire, e.g.,
to mend stockings), to make thick by pressure. The ל joined with תרקיע
is nota acc.; we must not comp. [Job
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008.md); [Job
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#022.md), as well as [Job
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#002.md); [Job
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#003.md).

Therefore: As God is the only Creator ([Job
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008).md), so He is the all-provident
Preserver of the world - make us know (הודיענוּ, according to the text
of the Babylonians, Keri of הודיעני) what we shall say to Him, viz., in
order to show that we can cope with Him! We cannot arrange, viz.,
anything whatever (to be explained according to ערך מלּין, [Job
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#014.md), comp. "to place," [Job
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#019).md), by reason of darkness, viz.,
the darkness of our understanding, σκότος τῆς διανοίας; מפּני is much
the same as [Job 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017.md), but different
from [Job 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#012.md), and חשׁך different
from both passages, viz., as it is often used in the New Testament, of
intellectual darkness (comp. [Ecc
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014.md); [Isa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002).md). The meaning of [Job
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#020.md) cannot now be mistaken, if, with
Hirz., Hahn, and Schlottm., we call to mind [Job
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#010.md) in connection with אמר כּי: can
I, a short-sighted man, enshrouded in darkness, wish that what I have
arrogantly said concerning and against Him may be told to God, or should
one earnestly desire (אמר, a modal perf., as [Job
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015).md) that (an jusserit s. dixerit
quis ut) he may be swallowed up, i.e., destroyed (comp. לבלעו, [Job
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#003).md)? He would, by challenging a
recognition of his unbecoming arguing about God, desire a tribunal that
would be destructive to himself.

[Job 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 37:21</span></span>

21 Although one seeth now the sunlight

That is bright in the ethereal heights:

A wind passeth by and cleareth them up.

22 Gold is brought from the north, -

Above Eloah is terrible majesty.

23 The Almighty, whom we cannot find out,

The excellent in strength,

And right and justice He perverteth not.

24 Therefore men regard Him with reverence,

He hath no regard for all the wise of heart.

He who censures God's actions, and murmurs against God, injures himself
- how, on the contrary, would a patiently submissive waiting on Him be
rewarded! This is the connection of thought, by which this final strophe
is attached to what precedes. If we have drawn the correct conclusion
from [Job 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001.md), that Elihu's
description of a storm is accompanied by a storm which was coming over
the sky, ועתּה, with which the speech, as [Job
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015.md), draws towards the close, is not
to be understood as purely conclusive, but temporal: And at present one
does not see the light (אור of the sun, as [Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026).md) which is bright in the ethereal
heights (בּהיר again a Hebr.-Arab. word, comp. bâhir, outshining,
surpassing, especially of the moon, when it dazzles with its
brightness); yet it only requires a breath of wind to pass over it, and
to clear it, i.e., brings the ethereal sky with the sunlight to view.
Elihu hereby means to say that the God who his hidden only for a time,
respecting whom one runs the risk of being in perplexity, can suddenly
unveil Himself, to our surprise and confusion, and that therefore it
becomes us to bow humbly and quietly to His present mysterious
visitation. With respect to the removal of the clouds from the beclouded
sun, to which [Job 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md) refers, זהב,
[Job 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022.md), seems to signify the gold
of the sun; esh-shemsu bi-tibrin, the sun is gold, says Abulola.
Oriental and Classic literature furnishes a large number of instances in
support of this calling the sunshine gold; and it should not perplex us
here, where we have an Arabizing Hebrew poet before us, that not a
single passage can be brought forward from the Old Testament literature.
But מצּפון is against this figurative rendering of the זהב (lxx νέφη
χρυσαυγοῦντα). In [Eze 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004.md) there is
good reason for the storm-clouds, which unfold from their midst the
glory of the heavenly Judge, who rideth upon the cherubim, coming from
the north; but wherefore should Elihu represent the sun's golden light
as breaking through from the north? On the other hand, in the conception
of the ancients, the north is the proper region for gold: there griffins
(grupe's) guard the gold-pits of the Arimaspian mountains (Herod. iii.
116); there, from the narrow pass of the Caucasus along the Gordyaean
mountains, gold is dug by barbarous races (Pliny, h. n. vi. 11), and
among the Scythians it is brought to light by the ants (ib. xxxiii. 4).
Egypt could indeed provide itself with gold from Ethiopia, and the
Phoenicians brought the gold of Ophir, already mentioned in the book of
Job, from India; but the north was regarded as the fabulously most
productive chief mine of gold; to speak more definitely: Northern Asia,
with the Altai mountains.

(Note: Vid., the art. Gold, S. 91, 101, in Ersch and Gruber. The Indian
traditions concerning Uttaraguru (the "High Mountain"), and concerning
the northern seat of the god on wealth Kuvra, have no connection here;
on their origin comp. Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, i. 848.)

Thus therefore [Job 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md), [Job
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#006.md) is to be compared here.

What Job describes so grandly and minutely in [Job
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md), viz., that man lays bare the
hidden treasures of the earth's interior, but that the wisdom of God
still transcends him, is here expressed no less grandly and
compendiously: From the north cometh gold, which man wrests from the
darkness of the gloomy unknown region of the north (צפון, ζόφος, from
צפן, cogn. טמן, טמר,

(Note: The verb צּפּה, obducere, does not belong here, but to צפח, and
signifies properly to flatten (as רקע, to make thin and thick by
striking), comp. Arab. ṣfḥ, to strike on something flat (whence
el-musâfaha, the salutation by striking the hand), and Arab. ṣf‛, to
strike with the flat hand on anything, therefore diducendo obducere.)

upon Eloah, on the contrary is terrible majesty (not genitival: terror
of majesty, Ew. 293, c), i.e., it covers Him like a garment ([Psa
104:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001).md), making Him inaccessible (הוד,
glory as resounding praise, vid., on [Job
39:20](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#020), like כבוד as imposing dignity.md).
The beclouded sun, [Job 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md) said,
has lost none of the intensity of its light, although man has to wait
for the removing of the clouds to behold it again. So, when God's doings
are mysterious to us, we have to wait, without murmuring, for His
solution of the mystery. While from the north comes gold - [Job
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022.md) continues - which is obtained by
laying bare the interior of the northern mountains, God, on the other
hand, is surrounded by inaccessibly terrible glory: the Almighty - thus
[Job 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023.md) completes the thought
towards which [Job 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022.md) tends - we
cannot reach, the Great in power, i.e., the nature of the Absolute One
remains beyond us, the counsel of the Almighty impenetrable; still we
can at all times be certain of this, that what He does is right and
good: "Right and the fulness of justice (ורב־ according to the Masora,
not ורב-) He perverteth not." The expression is remarkable: ענּה משׁפּט
is, like the Talmudic ענּה דּין, equivalent elsewhere to הטּה משׁפט; and
that He does not pervert רב־צדקה, affirms that justice in its whole
compass is not perverted by Him; His acts are therefore perfectly and in
every way consistent with it: רב־צדקה is the abstract. to צדיק כביר,
[Job 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017.md), therefore summa justitia.
One may feel tempted to draw ומשׁפט to שׂגיא כח, and to read ורב
according to [Pro 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029.md) instead of
ורב, but the expression gained by so doing is still more difficult than
the combination לא יענּה...ומשׁפט; not merely difficult, however, but
putting a false point in place of a correct one, is the reading לא יענה
(lxx, Syr., Jer.), according to which Hirz. translates: He answers, not,
i.e., gives no account to man. The accentuation rightly divides [Job
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023.md) into two halves, the second of
which begins with ומשׁפט - a significant Waw, on which J. H. Michaelis
observes: Placide invicem in Deo conspirant infinita ejus potentia et
justitia quae in hominibus saepe disjuncta sunt.

Elihu closes with the practical inference: Therefore men, viz., of the
right sort, of sound heart, uncorrupted and unaffected, fear Him
(יראוּהוּ verentur eum, not יראוּהוּ veremini eum); He does not see
(regard) the wise of heart, i.e., those who imagine themselves such and
are proud of their לב, their understanding. The qui sibi videntur (Jer.)
does not lie in לב (comp. [Isa 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#021).md),
but in the antithesis. Stick. and others render falsely: Whom the
aggregate of the over-wise beholds not, which would be יראנּוּ. God is
the subj. as in [Job 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#024.md); [Job
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#021.md), comp. [Job
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#026.md). The assonance of יראוהו and
יראה, which also occurs frequently elsewhere (e.g., [Job
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021).md), we have sought to reproduce in
the translation.

In this last speech also Elihu's chief aim ([Job
36:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#002).md) is to defend God against Job's
charge of injustice. He shows how omnipotence, love, and justice are all
found in God. When judging of God's omnipotence, we are to beware of
censuring Him who is absolutely exalted above us and our comprehension;
when judging of God's love, we are to beware of interpreting His
afflictive dispensations, which are designed for our well-being, as the
persecution of an enemy; when judging of His justice, we are to beware
of maintaining our own righteousness at the cost of the Divine, and of
thus avoiding the penitent humbling of one's self under His well-meant
chastisement. The twofold peculiarity of Elihu's speeches comes out in
this fourth as prominently as in the first: (1) They demand of Job
penitential submission, not by accusing him of coarse common sins as the
three have done, but because even the best of men suffer for hidden
moral defects, which must be perceived by them in order not to perish on
account of them. Elihu here does for Job just what in Bunyan (Pilgrim's
Progress) the man in the Interpreter's house does, when he sweeps the
room, so that Christian had been almost choked with the dust that flew
about. Then (2) they teach that God makes use of just such sufferings,
as Job's now are, in order to bring man to a knowledge of his hidden
defects, and to bless him the more abundantly if he will be saved from
them; that thus the sufferings of those who fear God are a wholesome
medicine, disciplinary chastenings, and saving warnings; and that
therefore true, not merely feigned, piety must be proved in the school
of affliction by earnest self-examination, remorseful self-accusation,
and humble submission.

Elihu therefore in this agrees with the rest of the book, that he frees
Job's affliction from the view which accounts it the evil-doer's
punishment (vid., [Job 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#003).md). On the
other hand, however, he nevertheless takes up a position apart from the
rest of the book, by making Job's sin the cause of his affliction; while
in the idea of the rest of the book Job's affliction has nothing
whatever to do with Job's sin, except in so far as he allows himself to
be drawn into sinful language concerning God by the conflict of
temptation into which the affliction plunges him. For after Jehovah has
brought Job over this his sin, He acknowledges His servant ([Job
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007).md) to be in the right, against the
three friends: his affliction is really not a merited affliction, it is
not a result of retributive justice; it also had not chastisement as its
design, it was an enigma, under which Job should have bowed humbly
without striking against it - a decree, into the purpose of which the
prologue permits us an insight, which however remains unexplained to
Job, or is only explained to him so far as the issue teaches him that it
should be to him the way to a so much the more glorious testimony on the
part of God Himself.

With that criticism of Job, which the speeches of Jehovah consummate,
the criticism which lies before us in the speeches of Elihu is
irreconcilable. The older poet, in contrast with the false doctrine of
retribution, entirely separates sin and punishment or chastisement in
the affliction of Job, and teaches that there is an affliction of the
righteous, which is solely designed to prove and test them. His thema,
not Elihu's (as Simson

(Note: Zur Kritik des B. Hiob, 1861, S. 34.)

with Hengstenberg thinks), is the mystery of the Cross. For the Cross
according to its proper notion is suffering ἕνεκεν δικαιοσύνης (or what
in New Testament language is the same, ἕνεκεν Χριστοῦ). Elihu, however,
leaves sin and suffering together as inseparable, and opposes the false
doctrine of retribution by the distinction between disciplinary
chastisement and judicial retribution. The Elihu section, as I have
shown elsewhere,

(Note: Vid., Herzog's Real-Encyklopdie, art. Hiob, S. 119.)

has sprung from the endeavour to moderate the bewildering boldness with
which the older poet puts forth his idea. The writer has felt in
connection with the book of Job what every Christian must feel. Such a
maintaining of his own righteousness in the face of friendly
exhortations to penitence, as we perceive it in Job's speeches, is
certainly not possible where "the dust of the room has flown about." The
friends have only failed in this, that they made Job more and more an
evil-doer deservedly undergoing punishment. Elihu points him to
vainglorying, to carnal security, and in the main to those defects from
which the most godly cannot and dare not claim exemption. It is not
contrary to the spirit of the drama that Job holds his peace at these
exhortations to penitence. The similarly expressed admonition to
penitence with which Eliphaz, [Job
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#001.md), begins, has not effected it. In
the meanwhile, however, Job is become more softened and composed, and in
remembrance of his unbecoming language concerning God, he must feel that
he has forfeited the right of defending himself. Nevertheless this
silent Job is not altogether the same as the Job who, in Job 40 and 42,
forces himself to keep silence, whose former testimony concerning
himself, and whose former refusal of a theodicy which links sin and
calamity together, Jehovah finally sets His seal to.

On the other hand, however, it must be acknowledged, that what the
introduction to Elihu's speeches, [Job
32:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001.md), sets before us, is consistent
with the idea of the whole, and that such a section as the introduction
leads one to expect, may be easily understood really as a member of the
whole, which carries forward the dramatic development of this idea; for
this very reason one feels urged to constantly new endeavours, if
possible, to understand these speeches as a part of the original form.
But they are without result, and, moreover, many other considerations
stand in our way to the desired goal; especially, that Elihu is not
mentioned in the epilogue, and that his speeches are far behind the
artistic perfection of the rest of the book. It is true the writer of
these speeches has, in common with the rest of the book, a like
Hebraeo-Arabic, and indeed Hauranitish style, and like mutual relations
to earlier and later writings; but this is explained from the
consideration that he has completely blended the older book with himself
(as the points of contact of the fourth speech with [Job
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md) and the speeches of Jehovah,
show), and that to all appearance he is a fellow-countryman of the older
poet. There are neither linguistic nor any other valid reasons in favour
of assigning it to a much later period. He is the second issuer of the
book, possibly the first, who brought to light the hitherto hidden
treasure, enriched by his own insertion, which is inestimable in its
relation to the history of the perception of the plan of redemption.

We now call to mind that in the last (according to our view) strophe of
Job's last speech. [Job 31:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#035.md), Job
desires, yea challenges, the divine decision between himself and his
opponents. His opponents have explained his affliction as the punishment
of the just God; he, however, is himself so certain of his innocence,
and of his victory over divine and human accusation, that he will bind
the indictment of his opponents as a crown upon his brow, and to God,
whose hand of punishment supposedly rests upon him, will he render an
account of all his steps, and go forth as a prince to meet Him. That he
considers himself a צדיק is in itself not censurable, for he is such:
but that he is מצדק נפשׁו מאלהים, i.e., considers himself to be
righteous in opposition to God, who is no angry with him and punishes
him; that he maintains his own righteousness to the prejudice of the
Divine; and that by maintaining his own right, places the Divine in the
shade, - all this is explainable as the result of the false idea which
he entertains of his affliction, and in which he is strengthened by the
friends; but there is need of censure and penitence. For since by His
nature God can never do wrong, all human wrangling before God is a
sinful advance against the mystery of divine guidance, under which he
should rather humbly bow. But we have seen that Job's false idea of God
as his enemy, whose conduct he cannot acknowledge as just, does not fill
his whole soul. The night of temptation in which he is enshrouded, is
broken in upon by gleams of faith, in connection with which God appears
to him as his Vindicator and Redeemer. Flesh and spirit, nature and
grace, delusion and faith, are at war within him. These two elements are
constantly more definitely separated in the course of the controversy;
but it is not yet come to the victory of faith over delusion, the two
lines of conception go unreconciled side by side in Job's soul. The last
monologues issue on the one side in the humble confession that God's
wisdom is unsearchable, and the fear of God is the share of wisdom
appointed to man; on the other side, in the defiant demand that God may
answer for his defence of himself, and the vaunting offer to give Him an
account of all his steps, and also then to enter His presence with the
high feeling of a prince. If now the issue of the drama is to be this,
that God really reveals Himself as Job's Vindicator and Redeemer, Job's
defiance and boldness must be previously punished in order that
lowliness and submission may attain the victory over them. God cannot
acknowledge job as His servant before he penitently acknowledges as such
the sinful weakness under which he has proved himself to be God's
servant, and so exhibits himself anew in his true character which
cherishes no known sin. This takes place when Jehovah appears, and in
language not of wrath but of loving condescension, and yet earnest
reproof, He makes the Titan quite puny in his own eyes, in order then to
exalt him who is outwardly and inwardly humbled.
