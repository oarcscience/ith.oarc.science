Against Babylon - Jeremiah 50-51

The genuineness of this prophecy has been impugned by the newer
criticism in different ways; for some quite refuse to allow it as
Jeremiah's, while others consider it a mere interpolation.

(Note: With regard to the special attacks and their refutation, see
details on Keil's Manual of Introduction to the Old Testament translated
by Prof. Douglas, in Clark's F.T.L. vol. i. p. 342ff.. To the list there
given of the defenders of this prophecy (of whom Kueper, Hvernick, and
Ngelsbach in the monograph entitled der Prophet Jeremias und Babylon,
1850, have thoroughly discussed the question), we must add the name of
Graf, who, in the remarks prefixed to his commentary on Jer 50f., has
thoroughly examined the arguments of his opponents, and reached this
result: "The prophecy contains nothing which Jeremiah could not have
written in the fourth year of Zedekiah; and the style of writing itself
exhibits all the peculiarities which present themselves in his book.
This prophecy is therefore as much his work as the prophecies against
the other foreign nations." Only the passage [Jer
51:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#015.md), a repetition of [Jer
10:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012.md), is said to proceed from
another hand, because it stands out of all connection with what precedes
and what follows it (but see the exposition); while he has so fully
vindicated, as genuine portions of the prophecy, other passages which
had been assumed as interpolations, even by Ngelsbach in his monograph,
that the latter, in treating of Jeremiah in Lange's Bibelwerk see
Clark's Translation, p. 419, has renounced his former doubts, and now
declares that it is only the passage in [Jer
51:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#015.md) that he cannot regard as
original.)

Hitzig (Exeg. Handb. 2 Aufl.) considers that this oracle, with its
epilogue, [Jer 51:59-64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md), is not to be
wholly rejected as spurious, as has been done by Von Clln and Gramberg;
he is so much the less inclined to reject it, because, although there is
many an interpolated piece here and there (?), yet no independent oracle
has hitherto been found in Jeremiah that is wholly interpolated. "In
fact," he continues, "this oracle shows numerous traces of its
genuineness, and reasons for maintaining it. The use of particular words
([Jer 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#006.md); [Jer
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md), [Jer
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#005.md),[Jer
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md), [Jer
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#014.md), [Jer
51:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#045.md), [Jer
51:55](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#055).md), and the circle of figures
employed ([Jer 51:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md), [Jer
51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034.md), [Jer
51:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#037).md), as well as the style ([Jer
50:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002.md), [Jer
50:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#007.md), [Jer
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#010).md), especially in turns like [Jer
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#002.md); the concluding formula, [Jer
51:57](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#057.md); the dialogue introduced without
any forewarning, [Jer 51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051.md), - all
unmistakeably reveal Jeremiah; and this result is confirmed by
chronological data." These chronological data, which Hitzig then
extracts from particular verses, we cannot certainly esteem convincing,
since they have been obtained through a method of exegesis which denies
the spirit and the essential nature of prophecy; but his remarks
concerning Jeremiah's use of words and his circle of images are
perfectly well-founded, and may be considerably corroborated if the
matter were more minutely investigated. Notwithstanding all this, Ewald
has again repeated, in the second edition of his work on the Prophets,
the assertion first made by Eichhorn, that this prophecy is spurious. He
does not, indeed, deny that "this long piece against Babylon has many
words, turns of expression, and thoughts, nay, even the whole plan, in
common with Jeremiah; and since Jeremiah is often accustomed in other
places also to repeat himself, this might, at the first look, even
create a prepossession favouring the opinion that it was composed by
Jeremiah himself. But Jeremiah repeats himself in a more wholesale
style, and is not unfaithful to himself in his repetitions: here,
however, the Jeremianic element peers through only in single though very
numerous passages, and the repeated portions are often completely
transformed. What, therefore, appears here as Jeremianic is rather a
studied repetition and imitation, which would require here to be all the
stronger, when the piece was intended to pass as one of Jeremiah's
writings." Ewald goes on to say that Babylon appears already as directly
threatened by Cyrus; and the whole view taken of Babylon as a kingdom
utterly degenerated, and unable any longer to escape the final
destruction, - the prophetic impetuosity shown in rising up against the
Chaldean oppression, - the public summons addressed to all the brethren
living in Babylon, that they should flee from the city, now
irrecoverably lost, and return to the holy land, - the distinct mention
of the Medes and other northern nations as the mortal enemies of
Babylon, and of the speedy and certain fall of this city; - all this,
says Ewald, is foreign to Jeremiah, nay, even conflicting and
impossible. For particular proof of this sweeping verdict, Ewald refers
to the name שׁשׁך ([Jer 51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md), as in
[Jer 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).md) for Babylon, לב for
כּשׂדּים, [Jer 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md), and similar
circumlocutions for Chaldean names, [Jer
51:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#021.md). He refers also to certain words
which are quite new, and peculiar only to Ezekiel and later writers:
סגן, פּחה, [Jer 51:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#023.md), [Jer
51:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025.md), [Jer
51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md); גּלּוּלים, [Jer
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002.md); בּדּים as a designation of false
prophets, [Jer 50:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#036.md); also to החרים,
to devote with a curse, [Jer 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021.md),
[Jer 50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md); [Jer
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#003.md), which in the rest of Jeremiah
occurs only [Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md). Further, he
refers to the headings found in [Jer
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001.md) and [Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md), which are quite different from
what Jeremiah himself would have written; and lastly, to the intimate
connection subsisting between [Jer
50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027.md); [Jer
51:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#040.md), and [Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md)., between [Jer
50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md) and [Isa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md), and between 51:60ff. and [Jer
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#016.md).

But all these considerations are much too weak to prove the spuriousness
of the passage before us. The connection with Isa 34 quite agrees with
Jeremiah's characteristic tendency to lean on older prophecies, and
reproduce the thoughts contained in them (we merely recall the case of
the prophecy concerning Moab in Jer 48, against whose genuineness even
Ewald has nothing to say); and it can be brought to tell against the
genuineness of this oracle only on the groundless supposition that Isa
34 originated in exile times. The headings given in [Jer
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001.md) and [Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md) contain nothing whatever that
would be strange in Jeremiah: [Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md) is not a title at all, but the
commencement of the account regarding the charge which Jeremiah gave to
Seraiah when he was going to Babylon, with reference to his carrying
with him the prophecy concerning Babylon; and the heading in [Jer
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001.md) almost exactly agrees with that
in [Jer 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013) (see the exposition.md). Of
the alleged later words, החרים and גּלּוּלים are derived from the
Pentateuch, בּדּים from [Isa 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#025.md).
סגן and פּחה certainly were not known to the Hebrews till the invasions
of Judah by the Assyrians and Chaldeans; but he latter of the two words
we find as early as in the address of the Assyrians in [Isa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#009.md), and the former in [Isa
41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025.md) : thus, not a single one of the
words alleged to have been first used by Ezekiel is peculiar to him.
Finally, of the circumlocutions used for the names "Babylon" and
"Chaldeans," Ewald himself confesses that שׁשׁך in [Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md) may be Jeremiah's; and he has
yet to give proof for the assertion that the names cited are merely
circumlocutions in which a play is made on words that did not come into
vogue till after Jeremiah's time. And as little has been even attempted
in the way of establishing the opinion he has expressed regarding what
is Jeremianic in the prophecy, - that it is a studied repetition and
imitation, - or the assertion that Babylon is represented as being
directly threatened by Cyrus. In the Old Testament Scriptures, Cyrus is
represented as the king of Persia, which he was; but this prophecy says
nothing of the Persians. Thus, the learned supplementary matter with
which Ewald seeks to support his general assertions is by no means
fitted to strengthen his position, but rather shows that the proper
argument for rejecting this oracle as spurious is not to be found in the
nature of this particular prophecy, but in the axiom openly expressed by
Eichhorn, von Clln, Gramberg, and other followers of the "vulgar
rationalism," that Jeremiah could not have announced the destruction of
Babylon by the Medes, because at his time the Medes had not yet appeared
on the scene of history as a conquering nation; for, according to the
principles of rationalism, the prophets could merely prophesy of things
which lay within the political horizon. It has not escaped the acute
observation of Hitzig, that the genuineness of this prophecy could not
be shaken by such general assertions; hence he has adopted Movers'
hypothesis of numerous interpolations, in order thereby to account for
the use made of portions of Isaiah, which, on dogmatic grounds, are
referred to the exile. But for this assumption also there are wanting
proofs that can stand the test. Besides the general assertion that
Jeremiah could not have repeated earlier prices word for word, the
arguments which Movers and Hitzig bring forward from the context, or
from a consideration of the contents, in the case of isolated verses,
depend upon false renderings of words, conjectures of a merely
subjective character, and misunderstandings of various kinds, which at
once fall to the ground when the correct explanation is given.

The germ of this prophecy lies in the word of the Lord, [Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md), "When seventy years are
completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation for their
iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and make it everlasting
desolations;" and its position with regard to the other prophecies of
Jeremiah against the nations has already been given in outline in the
statement of [Jer 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md), "And the king
of Sheshach (Babylon) shall drink after them." Just as these utterances
([Jer 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md), [Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).md) stand in full accord with the
announcement that, in the immediate future, all nations shall be given
into the power of the king of Babylon, and serve him seventy years; so,
too, the prophecy against Babylon now lying before us not only does not
stand in contradiction with the call addressed to Jeremiah, that he
should proclaim to his contemporaries the judgment which Babylon is to
execute on Judah and all nations, but it rather belongs to the complete
solution of the problems connected with this call. The announcement of
the fall of Babylon, and the release of Israel from Babylon, form the
subject of the prophecy, which is more than a hundred verses in length.
This double subject, the two parts of which are so closely connected, is
portrayed in a series of images which, nearly throughout, are arranged
pretty loosely together, so that it is impossible to summarize the rich
and varied contents of these figures, and to sketch a correct plan of
the course of thought and of the divisions of the oracle. Hence, too,
the views of expositors with regard to the division of the whole into
parts or strophes widely differ;

(Note: Thus, according to Eichhorn, Dahler, and Rosenmller, the whole
consists of several pieces (three or six) which originally belonged to
different periods; according to Schmieder, it consists of "seven
different poems of songs, all having the same subject, which, however,
they set forth from different sides, and under countless images."
Ngelsbach at first assumed that there were three main divisions, with
thirteen subdivisions; afterwards, in Lange's Bibelwerk see Clark's
Foreign Theol. Library, he thinks he is able also to distinguish three
stages of time, which, however, do not permit of being sharply defined,
so that he continues to divide the whole prophecy into nineteen separate
views or figures.)

we follow the view of Ewald, that the whole falls into three main parts
(Jer 50:2-28, [Jer 50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md) on to [Jer
51:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#026), and 51:27-58.md), every one of
which begins with a spirited exhortation to engage in battle. These
three main portions again fall into ten periods, of which the first
three ([Jer 50:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002.md), [Jer
50:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md), and [Jer
50:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021).md) form the first main
division; the four middle ones form the second main portion ([Jer
50:29-40](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md), [Jer
50:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#041.md) to [Jer
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#004.md), [Jer
51:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#005.md), and [Jer
51:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#015).md); while the following three
form the last (vv. 27-37, 38-49, and 50-58). We further agree with what
Ewald says regarding the contents of the first two parts in general,
viz., that in the first the prevailing view is the necessity for the
deliverance of Israel, and that in the second, the antithesis between
Babylon on the one hand, and Jahveh together with Israel, His spiritual
instrument, on the other, is fully brought out; but we do not agree with
his remark concerning the third part, that there the prevailing feature
is the detailed description of the condition of Israel at that time, for
this does not at all agree with the contents of 51:27-58. Rather, the
address rises into a triumphant description of the fall of Babylon, in
which the Lord will show Himself as the avenger of His people. On the
whole, then, the prophecy is neither wanting in arrangement nor in that
necessary progress in the development of thought which proves unity of
conception and execution.

[Jeremiah 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 50:1</span></span>

The title, "The word which Jahveh spake concerning Babylon, concerning
the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet," follows [Jer
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md) in choosing אשׁר דּ instead of
the usual אשׁר היה, and deviates from that passage only in substituting
"by the hand of Jeremiah" for "to Jeremiah," as in [Jer
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#002.md). The preference of the expression
"spake by the hand of" for "spake to," is connected with the fact that
the following prophecy does not contain a message of the Lord which came
to Jeremiah, that he might utter it before the people, but a message
which he was to write down and send to Babylon, [Jer
51:60](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#060.md). The apposition to "Babylon,"
viz., "the land of the Chaldeans," serves the purpose of more exactly
declaring that "Babylon" is to be understood not merely of the capital,
but also of the kingdom; cf. [Jer
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008.md), [Jer
50:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#045.md), and 51, 54.

[Jeremiah 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 50:2</span></span>

The fall of Babylon, and deliverance of Israel. - [Jer
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002.md). "Tell it among the nations, and
cause it to be heard, and lift up a standard; cause it to be heard,
conceal it not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is ashamed, Merodach is
confounded; her images are ashamed, her idols are confounded. [Jer
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#003.md). For there hath come up against
her a nation out of the north; it will make her land a desolation, and
there shall be not an inhabitant in it: from man to beast, \[all\] have
fled, are gone. [Jer 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#004.md). In those
days, and at that time, saith Jahveh, the children of Israel shall come,
they and the children of Judah together; they shall go, weeping as they
go, and shall seek Jahveh their God. [Jer
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005.md). They shall ask for Zion, with
their faces \[turned to\] the road hitherwards, \[saying\], Come, and
let us join ourselves to Jahveh by an eternal covenant \[which\] shall
not be forgotten. [Jer 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#006.md). My people
have been a flock of lost ones; their shepherds have misled them \[on\]
mountains which lead astray: from mountain to hill they went; they
forgot their resting-place. [Jer 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#007.md).
All who found them have devoured them; and their enemies said, We are
not guilty, for they have sinned against Jahveh, the dwelling-place of
justice, and the hope of their fathers, Jahveh. [Jer
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008.md). Flee out of the midst of
Babylon, and from the land of the Chaldeans; let them go forth, and let
them be like he-goats before a flock. [Jer
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#009.md). For, behold, I will stir up, and
bring up against Babylon, an assembly of great nations out of the land
of the north: and they shall array themselves against her; on that side
shall she be taken: his arrows \[are\] like \[those of\] a skilful hero
\[who\] does not return empty. [Jer
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#010.md). And \[the land of the\]
Chaldeans shall become a spoil; all those who spoil her shall be
satisfied, saith Jahveh."

In the spirit Jeremiah sees the fall of Babylon, together with its
idols, as if it had actually taken place, and gives the command to
proclaim among the nations this event, which brings deliverance for
Israel and Judah. The joy over this is expressed in the accumulation of
the words for the summons to tell the nations what has happened. On the
expression, cf. [Jer 4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md); [Jer
46:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#014.md). The lifting up of a standard,
i.e., of a signal-rod, served for the more rapid spreading of news; cf.
[Jer 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md); [Jer
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md), [Isa
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002.md), etc. "Cause it to be heard" is
intensified by the addition of "do not conceal it." The thing is to be
proclaimed without reserve; cf. [Jer
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014.md). "Babylon is taken," i.e.,
conquered, and her idols have become ashamed, inasmuch as, from their
inability to save their city, their powerlessness and nullity have come
to light. Bel and Merodach are not different divinities, but merely
different names for the chief deity of the Babylonians. Bel = Baal, the
Jupiter of the Babylonians, was, as Bel-merodach, the tutelary god of
Babylon. "The whole of the Babylonian dynasty," says Oppert, Expd. en
Msopot. ii. p. 272, "places him \[Merodach\] at the head of the gods;
and the inscription of Borsippa calls him the king of heaven and earth."
עצבּים, "images of idols," and גּלּוּלים, properly "logs," an expression
of contempt for idols (see on [Lev
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030).md), are synonymous ideas for
designating the nature and character of the Babylonian gods.

[Jer 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#003.md)

Babylon is fallen by a people from the north, that has gone out against
her, and makes her land a desolation. This nation is described in [Jer
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#009.md) as a collection, union of great
nations, that are enumerated especially in [Jer
51:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md). On "it \[the nation\] shall
make her land," etc., cf. [Jer 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#015.md);
[Jer 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#009.md); on the expression "from man
to beast," cf. [Jer 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#012.md); [Jer
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#009.md). נדוּ is from נוּד, [Jer
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008.md) and [Jer
49:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#030.md) = נדדוּ, from נדד, [Jer
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#009.md).

[Jer 50:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#004.md)

Then, when Babylon shall have fallen, the children of Israel and Judah
return out of their captivity, seeking Jahveh their God with tears of
repentance, and marching to Zion, for the purpose of joining themselves
to Him in an eternal covenant. The fall of Babylon has the deliverance
of Israel as its direct result. The prophet views this in such a way,
that all the steps in the fulfilment (the return from Babylon, the
reunion of the tribes previously separated, their sincere return to the
Lord, and the making of a new covenant that shall endure for ever),
which will actually follow successively in long periods, are taken
together into one view. By the statement made regarding the time, "In
those days, and at that time," the fall of Babylon and the deliverance
of Israel (which Jeremiah sees in the spirit as already begun) are
marked out as belonging to the future. Israel and Judah come together,
divided no more; cf. [Jer 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md). "Going
and weeping they go," i.e., they always go further on, weeping: cf. [Jer
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#006.md); [Sa2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#016.md); Ewald, 280, b. Cf. also [Jer
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021.md); [Jer
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009.md). Seeking the Lord their God, they
ask for Zion, i.e., they ask after the way thither; for in Zion Jahveh
has His throne. "The way hither" (i.e., to Jerusalem) "is their face,"
sc. directed. "Hither" points to the place of the speaker, Jerusalem.
באוּ are imperatives, and words with which those who are returning
encourage one another to a close following of the Lord their God. נלווּ
is imperative for ילּווּ, like נקבּצוּ in [Isa
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md), [Joe
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#011.md); cf. Ewald, 226, c. It cannot be
the imperfect, because the third person gives no sense; hence Graf would
change the vowels, and read נלוה. But suspicion is raised against this
by the very fact that, excepting [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md), לוה, in the sense of joining
oneself to, depending on, occurs only in the Niphal. בּרית עולם is a
modal accusative: "in an eternal covenant which shall not be forgotten,"
i.e., which we will not forget, will not break again. In fact, this is
the new covenant which the Lord, according to [Jer
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md)., will make in time to come with
His people. But here this side of the matter is withdrawn from
consideration; for the point treated of is merely what Israel, in his
repentant frame and returning to God, vows he shall do.

Israel comes to this determination in consequence of the misery into
which he has fallen because of his sins, [Jer
50:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005.md). Israel was like a flock of
lost sheep which their shepherds had led astray. צאן , a flock of sheep
that are going to ruin. The participle in the plural is joined with the
collective noun ad sensum, to show what is imminent or is beginning to
happen. The verb היה points to the subject צאן; hence the Qeri היוּ is
unnecessary. The plural suffixes of the following clause refer to עמּי
as a collective. The shepherds led the people of God astray on הרים
שׁובבים (a local accusative; on the Kethib שׁובבים, cf. [Jer
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032.md); [Jer
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#004); it is not to be read שׁובבים.md),
mountains that render people faithless. These mountains were so
designated because they were the seats of that idolatry which had great
power of attraction for a sinful people, so that the seduction or
alienation of the people from their God is ascribed to them. שׁובב is
used in the sense which the verb has in [Isa
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#010.md). The Qeri שׁובבוּם gives the
less appropriate idea, "the shepherds made the sheep stray." Hitzig's
translation, "they drove them along the mountain," does to suit the verb
שׁובב. Moreover, the mountains in themselves do not form unsuitable
pasture-ground for sheep, and הרים does not mean "a bare, desolate
mountain-range." The objection to our view of הרים, that there is no
very evident proof that worship on high places is referred to (Graf), is
pure fancy, and the reverse only is true. For the words which follow,
"they (the sheep) went from mountain to hill, and forgot their
resting-place," have no meaning whatever, unless they are understood of
the idolatrous dealings of Israel. The resting-place of the sheep (רבחם,
the place where the flocks lie down to rest), according to [Jer
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#007.md), is Jahveh, the hope of their
fathers. Their having forgotten this resting-place is the result of
their going from mountain to hill: these words undeniably point to the
idolatry of the people on every high hill ([Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); [Jer
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002.md); [Jer
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002), etc..md).

[Jer 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#007.md)

The consequence of this going astray on the part of Israel was, that
every one who found them devoured them, and while doing so, cherished
the thought that they were not incurring guilt, because Israel had been
given up to their enemies on account of their apostasy from God; while
the fact was, that every offence against Israel, as the holy people of
the Lord, brought on guilt; cf. [Jer
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003.md). This befell Israel because they
have sinned against Jahveh. נוה צדק, "the habitation (or pasture-ground)
of righteousness." So, in [Jer 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#023.md),
Zion is called the mountain on which Jahveh sits enthroned in His
sanctuary. As in other places Jahveh Himself is called a fortress, [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003.md); a sun, shield, [Psa
84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012.md); a shade, [Psa
121:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005.md); so here He is called the One in
whom is contained that righteousness which is the source of Israel's
salvation. As such, He was the hope of the fathers, the God upon whom
the fathers put their trust; cf. [Jer
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#008.md); [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md); [Psa
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005.md). The repetition of יהוה at the
end is intended to give an emphatic conclusion to the sentence.

[Jer 50:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008.md)

To escape from this misery, Israel is to flee from Babylon; for the
judgment of conquest and plunder by enemies is breaking over Babylon.
The summons to flee out of Babylon is a reminiscence of [Isa
38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020.md). The Kethib יצאוּ may be
vindicated, because the direct address pretty often makes a sudden
transition into the language of the third person. They are to depart
from the land of the Chaldeans. No more will then be necessary than to
change והיוּ into והיוּ. The simile, "like he-goats before the flock,"
does not mean that Israel is to press forward that he may save himself
before any one else (Graf), but that Israel is to go before all, as an
example and leader in the flight (Ngelsbach).

[Jer 50:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#009.md)

For the Lord arouses and leads against Babylon a crowd of nations, i.e.,
an army consisting of a multitude of nations. As meeעיר reminds us of
[Isa 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017.md), so קהל גּוים גּ remind us
of ממלכות גּוים נאספים in [Isa 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004.md).
ערך ל, to make preparations against. משּׁם is not used of time
(Rosenmller, Ngelsbach, etc.), for this application of the word has not
been established from the actual occurrence of instances, but it has a
local meaning, and refers to the "crowd of nations:" from that place
where the nations that come out of the north have assembled before
Babylon. In the last clause, the multitude of great nations is taken
together, as if they formed one enemy: "his arrows are like the arrows
of a wisely dealing (i.e., skilful) warrior."

(Note: Instead of משׂכּיל, J. H. Michaelis, in his Biblia Halens., has
accepted the reading משּׁכּיל on the authority of three Erfurt codices
and three old editions (a Veneta of 1618; Buxtorf's Rabbinic Bible,
printed at Basle, 1720; and the London Polyglott). J. D. Michaelis,
Rosenmller, Maurer, and Umbreit have decided for this reading, and point
to the rendering of the Vulgate, interfectoris, and of the Targum,
מתכּיל, orbans. On the other hand, the lxx and Syriac have read and
rendered משׂכּיל; and this reading is not merely presented by nonnulli
libri, as Maurer states, but by twelve codices of de Rossi, and all the
more ancient editions of the Bible, of which de Rossi in his variae
lectiones mentions forty-one. The critical witnesses are thus
overwhelming for משׂכּיל; and against משּׁכּיל there lies the further
consideration, that שׁכל has the meaning orbare, to render childless,
only in the Piel, but in the Hiphil means abortare, to cause or have
miscarriages, as is shown by רחם משּׁכּיל, [Hos
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#014)..md)

The words לא ישׁוּב do not permit of being referred, on the strength of
[Sa2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022.md), to one particular arrow
which does not come back empty; for the verb שׁוּב, though perhaps
suitable enough for the sword, which is drawn back when it has executed
the blow, is inappropriate for the arrow, which does not return. The
subject to ישׁוּב is גּבּור si , the hero, who does not turn or return
without having accomplished his object; cf. [Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011.md). In [Jer
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#010.md), כּשׂדּים is the name of the
country, "Chaldeans;" hence it is construed as a feminine. The
plunderers of Chaldea will be able to satisfy themselves with the rich
booty of that country.

[Jeremiah 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 50:11</span></span>

The devastation of Babylon and glory of Israel. - [Jer
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md). "Thou ye rejoice, though ye
exult, O ye plunderers of mine inheritance, though ye leap proudly like
a heifer threshing, and neigh like strong horses, [Jer
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012.md). Your mother will be very much
ashamed; she who bare you will blush: behold, the last of the nations
\[will be\] a wilderness, a desert, and a steppe. [Jer
50:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#013.md). Because of the indignation of
Jahveh it shall not be inhabited, and it shall become a complete
desolation. Every one passing by Babylon will be astonished, and hiss
because of all her plagues. [Jer
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#014.md). Make preparations against
Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, do not
spare an arrow, for she hath sinned against Jahveh. [Jer
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015.md). Shout against her round about;
she hath given herself up: her battlements are fallen, her walls are
pulled down; for it is Jahveh's vengeance: revenge yourselves on her; as
she hath done, do ye to her. [Jer
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#016.md). Cut off the sower from Babylon,
and him that handles the sickle in the time of harvest. From before the
oppressing sword each one will turn to his own nation, and each one will
flee to his own land. [Jer 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md).
Israel is a scattered sheep \[which\] lions have driven away: the first
\[who\] devoured him \[was\] the king of Babylon; and this, the last,
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, hath broken his bones. [Jer
50:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#018.md). Therefore thus saith Jahveh of
hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon ad
his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. [Jer
50:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#019.md). And I will bring back Israel to
his pasture-ground, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and on the
mountains of Ephraim his soul shall be satisfied. [Jer
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#020.md). In those days, and at that
time, saith Jahveh, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, but it
shall not be; and the sins of Judah, but they shall not be found: for I
will pardon those whom I will leave remaining."

[Jer 50:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md)

[Jer 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md) does not permit of being so
closely connected with what precedes as to separate it from [Jer
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012) (De Wette, Ngelsbach.md). Not only
is the translation, "for thou didst rejoice," etc., difficult to connect
with the imperfects of all the verbs in the verse, but the direct
address also does not suit [Jer 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#010.md),
and rather demands connection with [Jer
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012.md), where it is continued. כּי, of
course, introduces the reason, yet not in such a way that [Jer
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md) states the cause why Chaldea
shall become a spoil, but rather so that [Jer
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md) and [Jer
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012.md) together give the reason for the
threatening uttered. The different clauses of [Jer
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md) are the protases, to which [Jer
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012.md) brings the apodosis. "You may go
on making merry over the defeat of Israel, but shame will follow for
this." The change of the singular forms of the verbs into plurals (Qeri)
has been caused by the plural 'שׁסי , but is unnecessary, because
Babylon is regarded as a collective, and its people are gathered into
the unity of a person; see on [Jer
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#020.md). "Spoilers of mine inheritance,"
i.e., of the people and land of the Lord; cf. [Jer
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007.md); [Isa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#014.md). On פּוּשׁ, to gallop (of a
horse, [Hab 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008).md), hop, spring (of a
calf, Mal. 3:20), see on [Hab 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md).
דּשׁא is rendered by the lxx ἐν βοτάνη, by the Vulgate super herbam;
after these, Ewald also takes the meaning of springing like a calf
through the grass, since he explains דּשׁא as exhibiting the correct
punctuation, and remarks that פּוּשׁ, like הלך, can stand with an object
directly after it; see 282, a. Most modern expositors, on the other
hand, take דּשׁא as the fem. participle from דּוּשׁ, written with א
instead of ה: "like a threshing heifer." On this, A Schultens, in his
Animadv. philol., on this passage, remarks: Comparatio petita est a
vitula, quae in area media inter frumenta, ore ex lege non ligato ([Deu
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#010).md), prae pabuli abundantia gestit
ex exsultat. This explanation also gives a suitable meaning, without
compelling us to do violence to the language and to alter the text. As
to אבּירים, stallions, strong horses (Luther), see on [Jer
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016.md) and [Jer
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003.md). "Your mother" is the whole body
of the people, the nation considered as a unity (cf. [Isa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001.md); [Hos
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#004.md); [Hos
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005).md), the individual members of which
are called her sons; cf. [Jer 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md),
etc. In [Jer 50:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012.md), the disgrace that
is to fall on Babylon is more distinctly specified. The thought is
gathered up into a sententious saying, in imitation of the sayings of
Balaam. "The last of the nations" is the antithesis of "the first of the
nations," as Balaam calls Amalek, [Num
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020.md), because they were the first
heathen nation that began to fight against the people of Israel. In like
manner, Jeremiah calls Babylon the last of the heathen nations. As the
end of Amalek is ruin ([Num 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020).md), so
the end of the last heathen nation that comes forward against Israel
will be a wilderness, desert, steppe. The predicates (cf. [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006).md) refer to the country and kingdom
of Babylon. But if the end of the kingdom is a desert, then the people
must have perished. The devastation of Babylon is further portrayed in
[Jer 50:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#013.md), together with a statement
of the cause: "Because of the anger of Jahveh it shall not be
inhabited;" cf. [Isa 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md). The words
from והיתה onwards are imitated from [Jer
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#017.md) and [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md).

[Jer 50:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#014.md)

In order to execute this judgment on Babylon, the nations are commanded
to conquer and destroy the city. The archers are to place themselves
round about Babylon, and shoot at the city unsparingly. ערך does not
mean to prepare oneself, but to prepare מלחמה, the battle, combat. The
archers are mentioned by synecdoche, because the point in question is
the siege and bombardment of Babylon; cf. [Isa
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#018.md), where the Medes are mentioned
as archers. ידה is used only here, in Kal, of the throwing, i.e., the
shooting of arrows, instead of ירה, which is elsewhere the usual word
for this; and, indeed, some codices have the latter word in this
passage. "Spare not the arrow," i.e., do not spare an arrow; cf. [Jer
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#003.md). הריע, to cry aloud; here, to
raise a battle-cry; cf. [Jos 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#016.md). The
effect and result of the cry is, "she hath given her hand," i.e., given
herself up. נתן יד usually signifies the giving of the hand as a pledge
of faithfulness ([Kg2 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015.md); [Eze
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018.md); [Ezr
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#019).md), from which is derived the
meaning of giving up, delivering up oneself; cf. [Ch2
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#008.md). Cf. Cornelius Nepos, Hamilc. c.
1, donec victi manum dedissent. The ἁπ. λεγ. אשׁויתיה (the Kethib is
either to be read אשׁויּתיה, as if from a noun אשׁוית, or to be viewed
as an error in transcription for אשׁיותיה, which is the Qeri) signifies
"supports," and comes from אשׁה, Arab. asâ, to support, help; then the
supports of a building, its foundations; cf. אשּׁיּא, [Ezr
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012.md). Here the word signifies the
supports of the city, i.e., the fortifications of Babylon, ἐπάλξεις,
propugnacula, pinnae, the battlements of the city wall, not the
foundations of the walls, for which נפל is unsuitable. "It (sc., the
destruction of Babylon) is the vengeance of Jahveh." "The vengeance of
Jahveh" is an expression derived from [Num
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#003.md). "Avenge yourselves on her,"
i.e., take retribution for what Babylon has done to other nations,
especially to the people of God; cf. 27f. and [Jer
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011.md). The words, "cut off out of
Babylon the sower and the reaper," are not to be restricted to the
fields, which, according to the testimonies of Diod. Sic. ii. 7, Pliny
xviii. 17, and Curtius [Jer 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md), lay
within the wall round Babylon, but "Babylon" is the province together
with its capital; and the objection of Ngelsbach, that the prophet, in
the whole context, is describing the siege of the city of Babylon, is
invalid, because [Jer 50:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012.md) plainly
shows that not merely the city, but the province of Babylon, is to
become a wilderness, desert, and steppe. The further threat, also,
"every one flees to his own people from before the oppressing sword"
(cf. [Jer 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038.md); [Jer
46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016).md), applies not merely to the
strangers residing in Babylon, but generally to those in Babylonia.
Hitzig would arbitrarily refer these words merely to the husbandmen and
field-workers. The fundamental passage, [Isa
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014.md), which Jeremiah had before his
mind and repeats verbatim, tells decidedly against this view; cf. also
[Jer 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009.md), [Jer
51:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044.md).

[Jer 50:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md)

This judgment comes on Babylon because of her oppression and scattering
of the people of Israel, whom the Lord will now feed in peace again on
their native soil. Israel is like שׂה פזוּרה, a sheep which, having been
scared away out of its stall or fold, is hunted into the wide world; cf.
פּזּרוּ בגּוים, [Joe 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md). Although
פּזר, "to scatter," implies the conception of a flock, yet we cannot
take שׂה as a collective (Graf), since it is nomen unitatis. The point
in the comparison lies on the fact that Israel has been hunted, like a
solitary sheep, up and down among the beasts of the earth; and pizeer is
more exactly specified by the following clause, "lions have chased after
it." The object of הדּיחוּ is easily derived from the context, so that
we do not need to follow Hitzig in changing הדּיחוּ הראשׁון into
הדּיחוּה ראשׁון. These kings are, the king of Assyria first, and the
king of Babylon last. The former has dispersed the ten tribes among the
heathen; the latter, by destroying the kingdom of Judah, and carrying
away its inhabitants, has shattered the theocracy. The verbs apply to
the figure of the lion, and the suffixes refer to Israel. אכל is used of
the devouring of the flesh; עצּם is a denominative from עצם, and means
the same as גּרם, [Num 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md), to break
bones in pieces, not merely gnaw them. So long as the flesh only is
eaten, the skeleton of bones remains; if these also be broken, the
animal is quite destroyed.

[Jer 50:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#018.md)

The Assyrian has already received his punishment for that-the Assyrian
kingdom has been destroyed; Babylon will meet with the same punishment,
and then ([Jer 50:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#019).md) Israel will be
led back to his pasture-ground. נוה, pasture-ground, grass-plot, where
sheep feed, is the land of Israel. Israel, led back thither, will feed
on Carmel and Bashan, the most fertile tracts of the country, and the
mountains of Ephraim and Gilead, which also furnish fodder in abundance
for sheep. As to Gilead, see [Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md); [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md); and in regard to the mountains
of Ephraim, [Exo 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013.md)., where the
feeding on the mountains of Israel and in the valleys is depicted as fat
pasture. The mountains of Israel here signify the northern portion of
the land generally, including the large and fertile plain of Jezreel,
and the different valleys between the several ranges of mountains, which
here and there show traces of luxuriant vegetation even yet; cf.
Robinson's Physical Geography, p. 120. Then also the guilt of the sins
of Israel and Judah shall be blotted out, because the Lord grants pardon
to the remnant of His people. This promise points to the time of the New
Covenant; cf. [Jer 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034.md) and [Jer
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008.md). The deliverance of Israel from
Babylon coincides with the view given of the regeneration of the people
by the Messiah, just as we find throughout the second portion of Isaiah.
On the construction 'יבקּשׁ את־עון ישׂ, cf. 35:14, and Gesenius, 143, 1.
On the form תּמּצאינה, with y after the manner of verbs ה''ל, cf. Ewald,
198, b.

[Jeremiah 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 50:21</span></span>

The pride and power of Babylon are broken, as a punishment for the
sacrilege he committed at the temple of the Lord. [Jer
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021.md). "Against the land, -
Double-rebellion, - go up against it, and against the inhabitants of
visitation; lay waste and devote to destruction after them, saith
Jahveh, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. [Jer
50:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#022.md). A sound of war \[is\] in the
land, and great destruction. [Jer
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023.md). How the hammer of the whole
earth is cut and broken! how Babylon has become a desolation among the
nations! [Jer 50:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#024.md). I laid snares for
thee, yea, and thou hast been taken, O Babylon; but thou didst not know:
thou wast found, and also seized, because thou didst strive against
Jahveh. [Jer 50:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#025.md). Jahveh hath opened
His treasure-house, and brought out the instruments of His wrath; for
the Lord, Jahveh of hosts, hath a work in the land of the Chaldeans.
[Jer 50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md). Come against her, \[all of
you\], from the last to the first; open her storehouses: case her up in
heaps, like ruins, and devote her to destruction; let there be no
remnant left to her. [Jer 50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027.md).
Destroy all her oxen; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them!
for their day is come, the time of their visitation. [Jer
50:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#028.md). \[There is\] a sound of those
who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the
vengeance of Jahveh our God, the vengeance of His temple."

The punishment of Babylon will be fearful, corresponding to its crimes.
The crimes of Babylon and its punishment Jeremiah has comprised, in [Jer
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021.md), in two names specially formed
for the occasion. The enemy to whom God has entrusted the execution of
the punishment is to march against the land מרתים. This word, which is
formed by the prophet in a manner analogous to Mizraim, and perhaps also
Aram Naharaim, means "double rebellion," or "double obstinacy." It comes
from the root מרה, "to be rebellious" against Jahveh and His
commandments, whence also מרי, "rebellion;" [Num
17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001.md) :25, [Eze
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005.md), [Eze
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#007.md), etc. Other interpretations of the
word are untenable: such is that of Frst, who follows the Vulgate
"terram dominantium," and, comparing the Aramaic מרא, "Lord," renders it
by "dominion" (Herschaft). Utterly indefensible, too, is the translation
of Hitzig, "the world of men" (Menschenwelt), which he derives from the
Sanskrit martjam, "world," on the basis of the false assumption that the
language of the Chaldeans was Indo-Germanic. The only doubtful points
are in what respect Babylon showed double obstinacy, and what Jeremiah
had in his mind at the time. The view of Hitzig, Maurer, Graf, etc., is
certainly incorrect, - that the prophet was thinking of the double
punishment of Israel by the Assyrians and by the Babylonians ([Jer
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md) and [Jer
50:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#033).md); for the name is evidently
given to the country which is now about to be punished, and hence to the
power of Babylon. Ngelsbach takes a twofold view: (1) he thinks of the
defiance shown by Babylon towards both man and God; (2) he thinks of the
double obstinacy it exhibited in early times by building the tower, and
founding the first worldly kingdom ([Gen
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008)..md), and in later times by its
conduct towards the theocracy: and he is inclined rather to the latter
than to the former view, because the offences committed by Babylon in
early and in later times were, in their points of origin and aim, too
much one and the same for any one to be able to represent them as
falling under two divisions. This is certainly correct; but against the
first view there is also the important consideration that מרה is pretty
constantly used only of opposition to God and the word of God. If any
one, notwithstanding this, is inclined to refer the name also to
offences against men, he could yet hardly agree with Ngelsbach in
thinking of the insurrections of Babylon against the kings of Assyria,
their masters; for these revolts had no meaning in reference to the
position of Babylon towards God, but rather showed the haughty spirit in
which Babylon trod on all the nations.

The opinion of Dahler has most in its favour: "Doubly rebellious, i.e.,
more rebellious than others, through its idolatry ad its pride, which
was exalted it against God, [Jer
50:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#024.md), [Jer
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md)." Rosenmller, De Wette, etc.,
have decided in favour of this view. Although the dual originally
expresses the idea of pairing, yet the Hebrew associates with double,
twofold, the idea of increase, gradation; cf. [Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002.md); [Isa
66:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#007.md). The object is prefixed for the
sake of emphasis; and in order to render it still more prominent, it is
resumed after the verb in the expression "against it." פּקוד, an
infinitive in form, "to visit with punishment, avenge, punish," is also
used as a significant name of Babylon: the land that visits with
punishment is to be punished. Many expositors take חרב as a denominative
from חרב, "sword," in the sense of strangling, murdering; so also in
[Jer 50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027.md). But this assumption is far
from correct; nor is there any need for making it, because the meaning
of destroying is easily obtained from that of being laid waste, or
destroying oneself by transferring the word from things to men. החרים,
"to proscribe, put under the ban," and in effect "to exterminate;" see
on [Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md). On "after them," cf.
[Jer 49:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#037.md); [Jer
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002.md), [Jer
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#009.md),[Jer
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015.md), etc.

[Jer 50:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#022.md)

After the command there immediately follows its execution. A sound of
war is heard in the land. The words are given as an exclamation, without
a verb. As to שׁבר, which is an expression much used by Jeremiah, see on
[Jer 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md).

[Jer 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023.md)

Babylon, "the hammer of the whole earth," i.e., with which Jahveh has
beaten to pieces the nations and kingdoms of the earth ([Jer
51:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020).md), is itself now being beaten to
pieces and destroyed. On the subject, cf. [Isa
14:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005.md). Babylon will become the
astonishment of the nations, [Jer
51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md). "How!" is an exclamation of
surprise, as in [Zep 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015.md) -a passage
which probably hovered before the mind of the prophet.

[Jer 50:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#024.md)

This annihilation will come unexpectedly. As the bird by the snare of
the fowler, so shall Babylon be laid hold of by Jahveh, because it has
striven against Him. The Lord lays the snare for it, that it may be
caught. יקושׁ, "to lay snares;" cf. [Psa
141:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#009.md), where פּח is also found. ולא ,
"and thou didst not perceive," i.e., didst not mark it: this is a
paraphrase of the idea "unexpectedly," suddenly; cf. [Jer
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#008.md); [Isa
47:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#011.md). This has been literally
fulfilled on Babylon. According to Herodotus (i. 191), Cyrus took
Babylon by diverting the Euphrates into a trench he had dug. By this
stratagem the Persians threw themselves so unexpectedly on the
Babylonians (ἐξ ἀπροσδοκήτου σφι παρέστησαν οἱ Πέρσαι), that when the
outmost portions of the city had been already seized, those who lived in
the middle had not observed at all that they were captured (τοὺς τὸ
μέσον οἰκέοντας ου ̓ μανθάνειν ἑαλωκότας). Similarly, when the city was
taken under Darius Hystaspes, they were surprised that Zopyrus
traitorously opened the gates to the besiegers (Herodotus, iii. 158).
Babylon has contended against Jahveh, because, in its pride, it refused
to let the people of God depart; cf. [Jer
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md) and [Jer
50:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#033.md). In [Jer
50:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#025.md) the sudden devastation of
Babylon is accounted for. Jahveh opens His armoury, and brings out the
instruments of His wrath, in order to execute His work on the land of
the Chaldeans. אוצר, "magazine, treasure-chamber," is here applied to an
armoury. The "instruments of His wrath" are, in [Isa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005.md), the nations which execute the
judgment of god-here, the instruments of war and weapons with which
Jahveh Himself marches into battle against Babylon. On 'מלאכה וגו, cf.
[Jer 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010.md). The business which the
Lord has there regards the chastisement of Babylon for its insolence.
For the transaction of this business He summons His servants, [Jer
50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md). באוּ־להּ, as in [Jer
46:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#022.md); [Jer
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#009.md), is substantially the same as
באוּ עליה, [Jer 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014.md); [Jer
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#008.md). מקּץ, "from the end," or from
the last hitherwards, the same as מקּצה, [Jer
51:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#031.md), i.e., all together on to the
last; cf. [Gen 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#004.md); [Gen
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#002), etc. "Open her (Babylon's.md)
barns" or granaries; "heap it up (viz., what was in the granaries) like
heaps" of grain or sheaves, "and devote it to destruction," i.e.,
consume it with fire, because things on which the curse was imposed must
be burnt; cf. [Jos 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#012.md) and [Jos
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#013.md). All the property found in
Babylon is to be collected in heaps, and then burnt with the city. The
use of the image is occasioned by the granaries. מאבסיה is ἅπ. λεγ.,
from אבס, to give fodder to cattle, - properly a stall for fodder, then
a barn, granary. ערמה is a heap of grain ([Sol
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003).md), sheaves ([Rut
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#007)), also of rubbish (Neh. 3:34.md). As
[Jer 50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md) declares what is to be done
with goods and chattels, so does [Jer
50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027.md) state what is to be done with
the population. The figure employed in [Jer
50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md) is followed by the
representation of the people as oxen destined for slaughter; in this
Jeremiah had in his mind the prophecy found in Isa 34, in which the
judgment to come on Edom is depicted as a slaughter of lambs, rams, and
he-goats: the people of Edom are thus compared to cattle that may be
offered in sacrifice. This figure also forms the basis of the expression
ירד לטּבח in [Jer 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015.md), where this
style of speaking is used with regard to the youths or the young troops;
cf. also [Jer 51:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#040.md). The פּרים,
accordingly, designate not merely the chief among the people, or the men
of rank, but represent the whole human population. In the last clause
("for their day is come," etc.), there is a transition in the discourse
from the figure to the real subject itself. The suffix in עליהם does not
refer to the oxen, but to the men over whose murder there is an
exclamation of woe. In like manner, "their day" means the day of
judgment for men, viz., the time of their visitation with punishment;
see on [Jer 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#021.md). Fugitives and
escaped ones will bring to Zion, and proclaim the news of the execution
of this fearful judgment, that the Lord has fulfilled the vengeance of
His temple, i.e., avenged on Babylon the burning of His temple by the
Chaldeans. The fugitives and escaped ones are the Israelites, who were
summoned to flee from Babylon, [Jer
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#003.md). On "the vengeance of Jahveh,"
cf. [Jer 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015.md) and [Jer
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011.md).

[Jeremiah 50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 50:29</span></span>

The pride of Babylon is humbled through the utter destruction of the
people and the land. - [Jer 50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md).
"Summon archers against Jerusalem, all those who bend the bow; encamp
against her round about. Let there be no escape for her; recompense to
her according to her work; according to that which she hath done, do ye
to her: for she hath presumed against Jahveh, against the Holy One of
Israel. [Jer 50:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#030.md). Therefore shall
her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall fail in
that day, saith Jahveh. [Jer 50:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#031.md).
Behold, I am against thee, O Pride! said the Lord, Jahveh of hosts; for
thy day hath come, the time \[when\] I visit thee. [Jer
50:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#032.md). And Pride shall stumble and
fall, and he shall have none to lift him up; and I will kindle fire in
his cities, and it shall devour all that is round about him. [Jer
50:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#033.md). Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the
Children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together, and
all who led them captive kept hold of them; they refused to let them go.
[Jer 50:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#034.md). Their Redeemer is strong;
Jahveh of hosts is His name: He shall surely plead their cause, that He
may give rest to the earth, and make the inhabitants of Babylon tremble.
[Jer 50:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#035.md). A sword \[is\] against the
Chaldeans, saith Jahveh, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and
against her princes, and against her wise men. [Jer
50:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#036.md). A sword \[is\] against the
liars, and they shall become fools; a sword is against her heroes, and
they shall be confounded. [Jer 50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037.md).
A sword \[is\] against his horses, and against his chariots, and against
all the auxiliaries which \[are\] in the midst of her, and they shall
become women; a sword is against her treasures, and they shall be
plundered. [Jer 50:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#038.md). A drought is
against her waters, and they shall become dry; for it is a land of
graven images, and they are mad upon idols. [Jer
50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md). Therefore shall wild beasts
dwell \[there\] with jackals, and ostriches shall dwell in it; and it
shall no more be inhabited for ever, neither shall it be dwelt in from
generation to generation. [Jer 50:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#040.md).
As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their inhabitants, saith Jahveh,
no man shall dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn in it."

Further description of the execution of God's wrath. Archers shall come
and besiege Babylon round about, so that no one shall escape. The
summons, "Call archers hither," is a dramatic turn in the thought that
the siege is quickly to ensue. השׁמיע is used here as in [Jer
51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md), to summon, call by making
proclamation, as in [Kg1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022.md). רבּים
does not signify "many," as the ancient versions give it; this agrees
neither with the apposition which follows, "all that bend the bow," nor
with [Jer 50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md), where all, to the
last, are summoned against Babylon. Raschi, followed by all the moderns,
more correctly renders it "archers," and derives it from רבה = רבב, [Gen
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#023.md), cf. with [Jer
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#010.md), like רב, [Job
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013.md). The apposition, "all those who
bend the bow," gives additional force. חנה with accus. means to besiege;
cf. [Psa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006.md). "Let there be no
escape" is equivalent to saying, "that none may escape from Babylon."
The Qeri להּ after יהי is unnecessary, and merely taken from [Jer
50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md). On the expression "render to
her," etc., cf. [Jer 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md); and on
"according to all," etc., f. [Jer
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015.md). "For she hath acted
presumptuously against Jahveh," by burning His temple, and keeping His
people captive: in this way has Babylon offended "against the Holy One
of Israel." This epithet of God is taken from Isaiah, cf. [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005.md). This presumption must be
punished.

[Jer 50:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#030.md)

[Jer 50:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#030.md) is a repetition of [Jer
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#026.md). - [Jer
50:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#031.md). The Lord will now visit the
presumption of Babylon. The day of punishment has arrived. On "behold, I
am against thee," cf. [Jer 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013.md). "O
arrogance, pride!" is directly addressed to Babylon: in [Jer
50:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#032.md) also there is a like designation
of Babylon as the personification of pride. On the words "for thy day is
come," cf. [Jer 50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027.md). "And I will
kindle a fire," etc., stands as in [Jer
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014.md), where, however, "in its forest"
is found instead of "in his cities." The former, indeed, is the reading
rendered by the lxx in this passage; but they have acted quite
arbitrarily in this, since Jeremiah, for the most part, varies
individual words when he repeats a thought. "In his cities" does not
suit very well, inasmuch as the other cities of the country belonged to
Babylon, the μητρόπολις as hers, and in [Jer
51:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#043.md) they are spoken of as hers; cf.
[Jer 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015.md); [Jer
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md); [Jer
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md), etc.

[Jer 50:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#033.md)

Further description of the guilt and punishment of Babylon. The
presumptuous pride manifests itself in the fact that Israel and Judah
still languish in exile. All those who have been seized and carried away
they have kept hold of. שׁביהם is used as in [Isa
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002.md). They refuse to let them go, as
Pharaoh once did, [Exo 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#014.md), 27; [Exo
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#002.md); cf. [Isa
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#017.md). Jahveh, the deliverer of
Israel, cannot endure this. As the strong One, the God of hosts, He will
lead them in the fight; as their advocate, He will obtain their dues for
them; cf. [Jer 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md); [Isa
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#025.md). Dahler, Ewald, and Umbreit
follow the Vulgate and the Chaldee in taking 'למען הרגּיע as synonymous
with הרגּיז, in the sense of shaking, rousing, a meaning which רגע has
in the Kal, but which cannot be made out for the Hiphil. In the Hiphil
it means to give rest, to come to rest, [Deu
28:65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065.md); [Isa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md); [Isa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004.md); [Jer
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#002.md); and in the Niphal, to rest, keep
quiet, [Jer 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#006.md). This is the meaning
given by the Syriac, Raschi, Kimchi, Rosenmller, Maurer, Hitzig, etc.,
and supported by a comparison with [Isa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007.md), [Isa
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#003.md),[Isa
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#016.md). Babylon has hitherto kept the
earth in unrest and anxiety ([Isa
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#016).md); now it is to get rest ([Isa
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#003.md), [Isa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007).md), and trembling or quaking for
fear is to come on Babylon. The two verbs, which have similar sounds,
express a contrast. On the form of the infinitive הרגּיע, cf. Ewald,
238, d. In order to conduct the case of Israel as against Babylon, the
Lord ([Jer 50:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#035).md) calls for the
sword against the Chaldeans, the inhabitants of Babylon, on their
princes, wise men, heroes, and the whole army, the treasures and the
waters. There is no verb following חרב, but only the object with על, the
words being put in the form of an exclamation, on account of the passion
pervading them. The sword is to come and show its power on the
Chaldeans, i.e., the population of the rural districts, on the
inhabitants of the capital, and further, on the princes and wise men
(magicians). A special class of the last named are the בּדּים, properly
"babblers," those who talk at random, here "soothsayers" and lying
prophets, the astrologers of Babylon; see Delitzsch on [Isa
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#025.md) \[Clark's translation, For.
Theol. Lib.\]. ונאלוּ, "And they shall be as fools;" see on [Jer
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004.md). Further, on the warriors, the
horses, and war-chariots, the main strength of the Asiatic conquerors,
cf. [Jer 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md), [Isa
43:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017.md); [Psa
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008.md). כּל־הערב, "all the mixed
multitude" in the midst of Babylon: these are here the mercenaries ad
allies (as to this word, see on [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020).md). These shall become women,
i.e., weak and incapable of resistance; see [Nah
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#013.md). The last objects of vengeance
are the treasures and the waters of Babylon. In [Jer
50:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#038.md) the Masoretes have pointed חרב,
because חרב, "sword," seemed to be inapplicable to the waters. But
indeed neither does the sword, in the proper sense of the word, well
apply to treasures; it rather stands, by synecdoche, for war. In this
improper meaning it might also be used with reference to the waters, in
so far as the canals and watercourses, on which the fertility of
Babylonia depended, were destroyed by war. Hence many expositors would
read חרב here also, and attribute the employment of this word to the
rhetorical power connected with enumeration. Others are of opinion that
חרב may also mean aridity, drought, in [Deu
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#022.md); but the assumption is
erroneous, and cannot be confirmed by that passage. Neither can it be
denied, that to confine the reference of the expression "her waters" to
the canals and artificial watercourses of Babylonia seems unnatural. All
these received their water from the rivers Euphrates and Tigris, the
volume of water in which remained uninfluenced by war. We therefore
follow Hitzig in holding that חרב is the correct punctuation; in the
transition from חרב into חרב, with its similar sound, we neither
perceive any injury done to rhetorical force, derived from an
enumeration of objects, nor any need for referring the following clause,
which assigns the reason merely to such rhetorical considerations as
Graf does. In the drying up of the water there is no allusion to the
diversion of the Euphrates, by which Cyrus opened up for himself an
entrance into the city (Herodotus, i. 190); the drying up is merely
appointed by God, as a consequence of continued drought, for the purpose
of destroying the land. Hitzig's opinion neither suits the context, nor
can be justified otherwise; he holds that water is the emblem of the sea
on nations, the surging multitude of people in the streets of the city,
and he refers for proof to [Jer 51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036.md)
and [Isa 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001) (!.md). The clauses in [Jer
50:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#038.md), which assign the reason, refer
to the whole threatening, [Jer
50:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#035.md). Babylon is to be destroyed,
with its inhabitants and all its means of help, because it is a land of
idols (cf. [Jer 51:52](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#052.md) and [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009).md), and its inhabitants suffer
themselves to be befooled by false gods. התהולל means to act or behave
like a madman, rave, [Jer 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md); here,
to let oneself be deprived of reason, not (as Graf thinks) to fall into
a sacred frenzy. אימים, terrors, [Psa
88:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#016.md); here, objects of fear and
horror, i.e., idols.

[Jer 50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md)

Therefore shall Babylon become an eternal waste, where none but beasts
of the desert find shelter, where no human being dwells. This threat is
formed out of reminiscences from [Isa
13:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md) and [Isa

[Isa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md); for בּנות יענה, see on
[Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021.md). The second half of the
verse agrees word for word with [Isa
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md).

[Jer 50:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#040.md)

[Jer 50:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#040.md) is a repetition of [Jer
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018.md), and in its first half is
founded on [Isa 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md).

[Jeremiah 50:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jer 50:41</span></span>

The agents who execute the judgment. - [Jer
50:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#041.md). "Behold, a people shall come
from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up
from the most distant sides of the earth. [Jer
50:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#042.md). Bow and javelin shall they
seize: they are cruel, and will not pity; their voice shall sound like
the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, \[each one\] arrayed like a
man for the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. [Jer
50:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#043.md). The king of Babylon hath heard
the report concerning them, and his hands have fallen down: distress
hath seized him, writing pain, like \[that of\] the woman in childbirth.
[Jer 50:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#044.md). Behold, he shall come up
like a lion from the glory of Jordan to a habitation of rock; but in a
moment will I make them run away from her, and will set over her him who
is chosen: for who is like me, and who will appoint me a time \[to plead
my defence\]? and what shepherd \[is there\] that will stand before me?
[Jer 50:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#045.md). Therefore hear ye the
counsel of Jahveh which He hath taken against Babylon, and His purposes
which He hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Assuredly they
shall drag them away, the smallest of the flock; assuredly \[their\]
habitation shall be astonished at them. [Jer
50:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#046.md). At the cry, 'Babylon is taken,'
the earth is shaken, and a cry \[for help\] is heard among the nations.

Jeremiah 51

[Jer 51:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md)

"Thus saith Jahveh: Behold, I will stir up against Babylon, and against
the inhabitants of \[as it were\] the heart of mine opponents, the
spirit of a destroyer. [Jer 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#002.md). And
I will send against Babylon strangers, and they shall winnow her, and
empty her land, because they are against her round about in a day of
evil. [Jer 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#003.md). Against \[him who\]
bends let the bender bend his bow, and against \[him who\] lifts up
himself in his coat of mail: and do not spare her young men; devote to
destruction all her host, [Jer 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#004.md).
That slain ones may fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and those that
are pierced through in her streets."

The greater portion of this strophe consists of quotations from former
utterances. [Jer 51:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md) are taken
from [Jer 6:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022.md), and [Jer
51:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044.md) from [Jer
49:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md); here they are applied to
Babylon. What is said in [Jer 6:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022.md)
concerning the enemy out of the north who will devastate Judah, is here
transferred to the enemy that is to destroy Babylon. For this purpose,
after the words "and a great nation," are added "and many kings," in
order to set forth the hostile army advancing against Babylon as one
composed of many nations; and in consequence of this extension of the
subject, the verb יערוּ is used in the plural, and אכזרי is changed into
אכזרי המּה. Moreover, the mention of the "daughter of Babylon" instead
of the "daughter of Zion" is attended by a change from the directly
communicative form of address in the first person ("We have heard,"
etc., [Jer 51:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#043).md) into the third
person ("The king of Babylon hath heard," etc.). In applying the
expression used in [Jer 49:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md)
regarding the instrument chosen for the destruction of Edom, to the
instrument selected against Babylon ([Jer
51:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044).md), the names "Babylon" and
"and land of the Chaldeans" are substituted for "Edom" and "the
inhabitants of Teman" ([Jer 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020).md);
but beyond this, only the last verse is changed, in accordance with the
change of circumstances. The thought that, in consequence of the fall of
Edom, the earth trembles, and Edom's cry of anguish is heard on the Red
Sea, is intensified thus: by the sound or cry, "Babylon is taken," the
earth is shaken, and a cry is heard among the nations. The conquest of
Babylon, the mistress of the world, puts the whole world in anxiety and
fear, while the effects of Edom's fall extend only to the Red Sea. The
Kethib ארוצם, [Jer 51:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044.md), seems to
come from the verb רצץ, in the sense of pushing, so that it is not a
mere error in transcription for אריצם. Moreover, such changes made on
former utterances, when they are repeated and applied to Babylon, show
that these verses are not glosses which a reader has written on the
margin, and a later copyist inserted into the text, but that Jeremiah
himself has applied these earlier words in his address against Babylon.
The two passages are not merely quite appropriately arranged beside one
another, but even present in their connection a thought which has not
hitherto been met with in the address against Babylon, and which does
not recur afterwards. The enemy that is to conquer Babylon is certainly
pointed out, so early as v. 9, as an assemblage of great nations out of
the north, but not more particularly characterized there; but the
nations that are to constitute the hostile army are not further
designated till [Jer 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011.md) and [Jer
51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md). The second quotation, [Jer
51:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044.md), adds the new thought that
the appearance of this enemy against Babylon is owing to a decree of the
Lord, the execution of which no man can prevent, because there is none
like Jahveh. The figurative description of the enemy as a lion coming up
out of the thicket of reeds at the Jordan, frightening the herd feeding
on their pasture-ground, and carrying off the weakly sheep, is
appropriate both to Nebuchadnezzar's expedition against Edom, and to the
invasion of Babylonia by the Medes and their allies, for the purpose of
laying waste the country of the Chaldeans, smiting the inhabitants of
Babylon, and conquering it. Even the expression נוה permits of being
applied to Babylonia, which was protected by its canal system and the
strong walls of its capital.

[Jer 51:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md)

In [Jer 51:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md), the terrible character
of the hostile nation is further described. Against Babylon and the
inhabitants of Chaldea, God stirs up the "spirit of a destroyer," viz.,
a savage nation that will massacre the Chaldeans without pity. לב ,
lit., "the heart of mine adversaries," is the word כּשׂדּים, changed,
according to the canon Atbash (see on [Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).md), for the purpose of obtaining
the important meaning that Chaldea is the centre of God's enemies. This
explanation of the name involves the thought that all enmity against God
the Lord culminates in Babylon; on the basis of this representation
Babylon is called, [Rev 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md), "the
mother of harlots and abominations of the earth." רוּח משׁחית does not
mean καύσωνα διαφθείροντα (lxx), ventum pestilentem (Vulgate), "a sharp
wind" (Luther), nor, as it is usually translated, "a destroying wind;"
for העיר רוּח is nowhere used of the rousing of a wind, but everywhere
means "to rouse the spirit of any one," to stir him up to an
undertaking; cf. [Hag 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md); [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md); [Ch2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md), and [Ch2
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022.md). Jeremiah also employs it thus
in [Jer 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011.md), and this meaning is
quite suitable here also. משׁחית is a substantive, as in [Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md) : "the spirit of a destroyer." The
figure of winnowing, which follows in [Jer
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#002.md), does not by any means
necessarily require the meaning "wind," because the figure contained in
the word זרוּה was first called forth by the employment of זרים,
"strangers" = barbarians. The sending of the זרים to Babylon has no
connection with the figure of the wind, and it even remains a question
whether זרוּה really means here to winnow, because the word is often
used of the scattering of a nation, without any reference to the figure
of winnowing; cf. [Lev 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033.md); [Eze
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010.md); [Eze
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#015.md), etc., also [Jer
49:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#032.md), [Jer
49:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#036.md). However, this thought is
suggested by what follows, "they empty her hand," although the clause
which assigns the reason, "because they are against her round about"
(cf. [Jer 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#017).md), does not correspond
with this figure, but merely declares that the enemies which attack
Babylon on every side disperse its inhabitants and empty the land.

[Jer 51:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#003.md)

These strangers shall kill, without sparing, every warrior of Babylon,
and annihilate its whole military forces. In the first half of the verse
the reading is doubtful, since the Masoretes would have the second ידרד
(Qeri) expunged, probably because (as Bttcher, N. Aehrenl. ii. S. 166,
supposes) they considered it merely a repetition. The meaning is not
thereby changed. According to the Qeri, we would require to translate,
"against him who bends the bow, may there be, or come, one who bends his
bow;" according to the Kethib, "against him who bends the bow, may he
who bends his bow bend it." As to אל־ידרך with אשׁר omitted, cf. [Ch1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012.md); [Ch2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#004.md), and Ewald, 333, b. יתעל בּס'
stands in apposition to אל־ידרך ; יתעל is the Hithpael from עלה, and
means to raise oneself: it is to be taken as the shortened form of the
imperfect passive; cf. Gesenius, 128, Rem. 2. Certainly, the Hithpael of
עלה occurs nowhere else, but it is quite appropriate here; so that it is
unnecessary, with Hitzig, to adduce, for explanation, the Arabic tl', to
stretch the head out of anything, or, with Ewald, to derive the form
from the Aramaic עלל, Arabic gl, to thrust in. Neither is there any
foundation for the remark, that the abbreviated form of the imperfect
would be admissible only if אל were found instead of אל. Indeed, the
Syriac, Targum, and Vulgate have actually read and rendered from אל,
which several codices also present, "Let him not bend his bow, nor
stretch himself in his coat of mail." But by this reading the first half
of the verse is put in contradiction to the second; and this
contradiction is not removed by the supposition of J. D. Michaelis and
Hitzig, who refer these clauses to the Chaldeans, and find the thought
expressed in them, that the Chaldeans, through loss of courage, cannot
set themselves for defence. For, in that case, we would be obliged, with
Hitzig, to explain as spurious the words that follow, "and spare ye not
her young men;" but for this there is no valid reason. As to החרימוּ,
cf. [Jer 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021.md), [Jer
50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md). On [Jer
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#004.md), cf. [Jer
50:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#030.md) and [Jer
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#026.md). The suffix in "her streets"
refers to Babylon.
