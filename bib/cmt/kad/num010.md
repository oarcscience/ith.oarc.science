### [Numbers Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 10:1</span></span>

The Silver Signal-Trumpets. - Although God Himself appointed the time
for removal and encampment by the movement of the cloud of His presence,
signals were also requisite for ordering and conducting the march of so
numerous a body, by means of which Moses, as commander-in-chief, might
make known his commands to the different divisions of the camp. To this
end God directed him to prepare two silver trumpets of beaten work
(mikshah, see [Exo 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018).md), which
should serve "for the calling of the assembly, and for the breaking up
of the camps," i.e., which were to be used for this purpose. The form of
these trumpets is not further described. No doubt they were straight,
not curved, as we may infer both from the representation of these
trumpets on the triumphal arch of Titus at Rome, and also from the fact,
that none but straight trumpets occur on the old Egyptian monuments (see
my Arch. ii. p. 187). With regard to the use of them for calling the
congregation, the following directions are given in [Num
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#003.md), [Num
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#004.md) : "When they shall blow with them
(i.e., with both), the whole congregation (in all its representatives)
shall assemble at the door of the tabernacle; if they blow with only
one, the princes or heads of the families of Israel shall assemble
together."

[Numbers 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 10:5</span></span>

To give the signal for breaking up the camp, they were to blow תּרוּעה,
i.e., a noise or alarm. At the first blast the tribes on the east, i.e.,
those who were encamped in the front of the tabernacle, were to break
up; at the second, those who were encamped on the south; and so on in
the order prescribed in ch. 2, though this is not expressly mentioned
here. The alarm was to be blown למסּעיהם, with regard to their breaking
up or marching.

[Numbers 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 10:7</span></span>

But to call the congregation together they were to blow, not to sound an
alarm. תּקע signifies blowing in short, sharp tones. הריע = תּרוּעה
תּקע, blowing in a continued peal.

[Numbers 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 10:8</span></span>

These trumpets were to be used for the holy purposes of the congregation
generally, and therefore not only the making, but the manner of using
them was prescribed by God Himself. They were to be blown by the priests
alone, and "to be for an eternal ordinance to the families of Israel,"
i.e., to be preserved and used by them in all future times, according to
the appointment of God. The blast of these trumpets was to call Israel
to remembrance before Jehovah in time of war and on their feast-days.

[Num 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009.md)

"If ye go to war in your land against the enemy who oppresses you, and
ye blow the trumpets, ye shall bring yourselves to remembrance before
Jehovah, and shall be saved (by Him) from your enemies." מלחמה בּוא, to
come into war, or go to war, is to be distinguished from למּלחמה בּוא,
to make ready for war, go out to battle ([Num
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#021.md); [Num
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#006).md).

[Num 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010.md)

"And on your joyous day, and your feasts and new moons, he shall blow
the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, that they
may be to you for a memorial (remembrance) before your God." - השּׂמחה
יום is any day on which a practical expression was given to their joy,
in the form of a sacrifice. The השּׂמחה are the feasts enumerated in
chs. 28 and 29 and Lev 23. The "beginnings of the months," or new-moon
days, were not, strictly speaking, feast-days, with the exception of the
seventh new moon of the year (see at [Num
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011).md). On the object, viz., "for a
memorial," see [Exo 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#029.md), and the
explanation, p. 450. In accordance with this divine appointment, so full
of promise, we find that in after times the trumpets were blown by the
priests in war ([Num 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#006.md); [Ch2
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#012.md), [Ch2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#014.md); [Ch2
20:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021.md), [Ch2
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#028).md) as well as on joyful occasions,
such as at the removal of the ark ([Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024.md); [Ch1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#006).md), at the consecration of
Solomon's temple ([Ch2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012.md); [Ch2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#006).md), the laying of the foundation of
the second temple ([Ezr 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010).md), the
consecration of the walls of Jerusalem ([Neh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#035.md), [Neh
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#041).md), and other festivities ([Ch2
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#027).md).

[Numbers 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 10:11</span></span>

After all the preparations were completed for the journey of the
Israelites from Sinai to Canaan, on the 20th day of the second month, in
the second year, the cloud rose up from the tent of witness, and the
children of Israel broke up out of the desert of Sinai, למסעיהם,
"according to their journeys" (lit., breaking up; see at [Gen
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#003.md) and [Exo
40:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#036.md), [Exo
40:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#038).md), i.e., in the order prescribed
in [Num 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#009.md), [Num
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#016.md), [Num
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#024.md), [Num
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#031.md), and described in [Num
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014.md). of this chapter. "And the cloud
rested in the desert of Paran." In these words, the whole journey from
the desert of Sinai to the desert of Paran is given summarily, or as a
heading; and the more minute description follows from [Num
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014.md) to [Num
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016.md). The "desert of Paran" was not
the first station, but the third; and the Israelites did not arrive at
it till after they had left Hazeroth ([Num
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016).md). The desert of Sinai is
mentioned as the starting-point of the journey through the desert, in
contrast with the desert of Paran, in the neighbourhood of Kadesh,
whence the spies were sent out to Canaan ([Num
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#002.md), [Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021).md), the goal and termination of
their journey through the desert. That the words, "the cloud rested in
the desert of Paran" ([Num 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012).md),
contain a preliminary statement (like [Gen
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#023.md); [Gen
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#005.md), as compared with [Num
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#008.md), and [Kg1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009.md) as compared with [Num
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014), etc..md), is unmistakeably
apparent, from the fact that Moses' negotiations with Hobab, respecting
his accompanying the Israelites to Canaan, as a guide who knew the road,
are noticed for the first time in [Num
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md)., although they took place
before the departure from Sinai, and that after this the account of the
breaking-up is resumed in [Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md),
and the journey itself described, Hence, although Kurtz (iii. 220)
rejects this explanation of [Num 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012.md)
as "forced," and regards the desert of Paran as a place of encampment
between Tabeerah and Kibroth-hattaavah, even he cannot help identifying
the breaking-up described in [Num
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md) with that mentioned in [Num
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012.md); that is to say, regarding [Num
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012.md) as a summary of the events which
are afterwards more fully described.

The desert of Paran is the large desert plateau which is bounded on the
east by the Arabah, the deep valley running from the southern point of
the Dead Sea to the Elanitic Gulf, and stretches westwards to the desert
of Shur (Jifar; see [Gen 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007.md); [Exo
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#022).md), that separates Egypt from
Philistia: it reaches southwards to Jebel et Tih, the foremost spur of
the Horeb mountains, and northwards to the mountains of the Amorites,
the southern border of Canaan. The origin and etymology of the name are
obscure. The opinion that it was derived from פאר, to open wide, and
originally denoted the broad valley of Wady Murreh, between the Hebrew
Negeb and the desert of Tih, and was then transferred to the whole
district, has very little probability in it (Knobel). All that can be
regarded as certain is, that the El-paran of [Gen
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006.md) is a proof that in the very
earliest times the name was applied to the whole of the desert of Tih
down to the Elanitic Gulf, and that the Paran of the Bible had no
historical connection either with the ́ ̀ and tribe of Φαρανῖται
mentioned by Ptol. (v. 17, i. 3), or with the town of Φαράν, of which
the remains are still to be seen in the Wady Feiran at Serbal, or with
the tower of Faran Ahrun of Edrisi, the modern Hammn Faraun, on the Red
Sea, to the south of the Wady Gharandel. By the Arabian geographers,
Isztachri, Kazwini, and others, and also by the Bedouins, it is called
et Tih, i.e., the wandering of the children of Israel, as being the
ground upon which the children of Israel wandered about in the
wilderness for forty years (or more accurately, thirty-eight). This
desert plateau, which is thirty German miles (150 English) long from
south to north, and almost as broad, consists, according to Arabian
geographers, partly of sand and partly of firm soil, and is intersected
through almost its entire length by the Wady el Arish, which commences
at a short distance from the northern extremity of the southern border
mountains of et Tih, and runs in nearly a straight line from south to
north, only turning in a north-westerly direction towards the
Mediterranean Sea, on the north-east of the Jebel el Helal. This wady
divides the desert of Paran into a western and an eastern half. The
western half lies lower than the eastern, and slopes off gradually,
without any perceptible natural boundary, into the flat desert of Shur
(Jifar), on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. The eastern half
(between the Arabah and the Wady el Arish) consists throughout of a
lofty mountainous country, intersected by larger and smaller wadys, and
with extensive table-land between the loftier ranges, which slopes off
somewhat in a northerly direction, its southern edge being formed by the
eastern spurs of the Jebel et Tih. It is intersected by the Wady el
Jerafeh, which commences at the foot of the northern slope of the
mountains of Tih, and after proceeding at first in a northerly
direction, turns higher up in a north-easterly direction towards the
Arabah, but rises in its northern portion to a strong mountain fortress,
which is called, from its present inhabitants, the highlands of the
Azazimeh, and is bounded on both south and north by steep and lofty
mountain ranges. The southern boundary is formed by the range which
connects the Araif en Nakba with the Jebel el Mukrah on the east; the
northern boundary, by the mountain barrier which stretches along the
Wady Murreh from west to east, and rises precipitously from it, and of
which the following description has been given by Rowland and Williams,
the first of modern travellers to visit this district, who entered the
terra incognita by proceeding directly south from Hebron, past Arara or
Aror, and surveyed it from the border of the Rachmah plateau, i.e., of
the mountains of the Amorites ([Deu
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md), [Deu
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#020.md), [Deu
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044).md), or the southernmost plateau of
the mountains of Judah (see at [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045).md): - "A gigantic mountain towered
above us in savage grandeur, with masses of naked rock, resembling the
bastions of some Cyclopean architecture, the end of which it was
impossible for the eye to reach, towards either the west or the east. It
extended also a long way towards the south; and with its rugged, broken,
and dazzling masses of chalk, which reflected the burning rays of the
sun, it looked like an unapproachable furnace, a most fearful desert,
without the slightest trace of vegetation. A broad defile, called Wady
Murreh, ran at the foot of this bulwark, towards the east; and after a
course of several miles, on reaching the strangely formed mountain of
Moddera (Madurah), it is divided into two parts, the southern branch
still retaining the same name, and running eastwards to the Arabah,
whilst the other was called Wady Fikreh, and ran in a north-easterly
direction to the Dead Sea. This mountain barrier proved to us beyond a
doubt that we were now standing on the southern boundary of the promised
land; and we were confirmed in this opinion by the statement of the
guide, that Kadesh was only a few hours distant from the point where we
were standing" (Ritter, xiv. p. 1084). The place of encampment in the
desert of Paran is to be sought for at the north-west corner of this
lofty mountain range (see at [Num
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016).md).

[Numbers 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 10:13</span></span>

In vv. 13-28 the removal of the different camps is more fully described,
according to the order of march established in ch. 2, the order in which
the different sections of the Levites drew out and marched being
particularly described in this place alone (cf. [Num
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#017.md) and [Num
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#021.md) with [Num
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017).md). First of all (lit., "at the
beginning") the banner of Judah drew out, with Issachar and Zebulun
([Num 10:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014.md); cf. [Num
2:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003).md). The tabernacle was then taken
down, and the Gershonites and Merarites broke up, carrying those
portions of its which were assigned to them ([Num
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#017.md); cf. [Num
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#024.md)., and [Num
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#031)..md), that they might set up the
dwelling at the place to be chosen for the next encampment, before the
Kohathites arrived with the sacred things ([Num
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#021).md). The banner of Reuben followed
next with Simeon and Gad ([Num
10:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#018.md); cf. [Num
2:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#010).md), and the Kohathites joined
them bearing the sacred things ([Num
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#021).md). המּקדּשׁ (= הקּדשׁ, [Num
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009.md), and הקּדשׁים קדשׁ, [Num
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#004).md) signifies the sacred things
mentioned in [Num 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031.md). In [Num
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#021.md) the subject is the Gershonites
and Merarites, who had broken up before with the component parts of the
dwelling, and set up the dwelling, עד־בּאם, against their (the
Kohathites') arrival, so that they might place the holy things at once
within it.

[Numbers 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 10:22</span></span>

Behind the sacred things came the banners of Ephraim, with Manasseh and
Benjamin (see [Num 2:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#018).md), and Dan
with Asher and Naphtali ([Num
2:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#025).md); so that the camp of Dan was
the "collector of all the camps according to their hosts," i.e., formed
that division of the army which kept the hosts together.

[Numbers 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 10:29</span></span>

The conversation in which Moses persuaded Hobab the Midianite, the son
of Reguel (see at [Exo 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016).md), and his
brother-in-law, to go with the Israelites, and being well acquainted
with the desert to act as their leader, preceded the departure in order
of time; but it is placed between the setting out and the march itself,
as being subordinate to the main events. When and why Hobab came into
the camp of the Israelites-whether he came with his father Reguel (or
Jethro) when Israel first arrived at Horeb, and so remained behind when
Jethro left ([Exo 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#027).md), or whether
he did not come till afterwards-was left uncertain, because it was a
matter of no consequence in relation to what is narrated here.

(Note: The grounds upon which Knobel affirms that the "Elohist" is not
the author of the account in [Num
10:29-36](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md), and pronounces it a
Jehovistic interpolation, are perfectly futile. The assertion that the
Elohist had already given a full description of the departure in vv.
11-28, rests upon an oversight of the peculiarities of the Semitic
historians. The expression "they set forward" in [Num
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#028.md) is an anticipatory remark, as
Knobel himself admits in other places (e.g., [Gen
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#012.md); [Gen
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#003.md); [Exo
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#006.md); [Exo
12:50](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#050.md); [Exo
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#034).md). The other argument, that
Moses' brother-in-law is not mentioned anywhere else, involves a petitio
principii, and is just as powerless a proof, as such peculiarities of
style as "mount of the Lord," "ark of the covenant of the Lord," היטיב
to do good ([Num 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029).md), and others of
a similar kind, of which the critics have not even attempted to prove
that they are at variance with the style of the Elohist, to say nothing
of their having actually done so.)

The request addressed to Hobab, that he would go with them to the place
which Jehovah had promised to give them, i.e., to Canaan, was supported
by the promise that he would do good to them (Hobab and his company), as
Jehovah had spoken good concerning Israel, i.e., had promised it
prosperity in Canaan. And when Hobab declined the request, and said that
he should return into his own land, i.e., to Midian at the south-east of
Sinai (see at [Exo 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015.md) and [Exo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001).md), and to his kindred, Moses
repeated the request, "Leave us not, forasmuch as thou knowest our
encamping in the desert," i.e., knowest where we can pitch our tents;
"therefore be to us as eyes," i.e., be our leader and guide, - and
promised at the same time to do him the good that Jehovah would do to
them. Although Jehovah led the march of the Israelites in the pillar of
cloud, not only giving the sign for them to break up and to encamp, but
showing generally the direction they were to take; yet Hobab, who was
well acquainted with the desert, would be able to render very important
service to the Israelites, if he only pointed out, in those places where
the sign to encamp was given by the cloud, the springs, oases, and plots
of pasture which are often buried quite out of sight in the mountains
and valleys that overspread the desert. What Hobab ultimately decided to
do, we are not told; but "as no further refusal is mentioned, and the
departure of Israel is related immediately afterwards, he probably
consented" (Knobel). This is raised to a certainty by the fact that, at
the commencement of the period of the Judges, the sons of the
brother-in-law of Moses went into the desert of Judah to the south of
Arad along with the sons of Judah ([Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016).md), and therefore had entered
Canaan with the Israelites, and that they were still living in that
neighbourhood in the time of Saul ([Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md); [Sa1
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010.md); [Sa1
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#029).md).

[Numbers 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 10:33</span></span>

"And they (the Israelites) departed from the mount of Jehovah ([Exo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001).md) three days' journey; the ark of
the covenant of Jehovah going before them, to search out a resting-place
for them. And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day, when they broke
up from the camp." Jehovah still did as He had already done on the way
to Sinai ([Exo 13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021).md): He went
before them in the pillar of cloud, according to His promise ([Exo
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#013).md), on their journey from Sinai to
Canaan; with this simple difference, however, that henceforth the cloud
that embodied the presence of Jehovah was connected with the ark of the
covenant, as the visible throne of His gracious presence which had been
appointed by Jehovah Himself. To this end the ark of the covenant was
carried separately from the rest of the sacred things, in front of the
whole army; so that the cloud which went before them floated above the
ark, leading the procession, and regulating its movements in the
direction it took in such a manner that the permanent connection between
the cloud and the sanctuary might be visibly manifested even during
their march. It is true that, in the order observed in the camp and on
the march, no mention is made of the ark of the covenant going in front
of the whole army; but this omission is no more a proof of any
discrepancy between this verse and [Num
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017.md), or of a difference of
authorship, than the separation of the different divisions of the
Levites upon the march, which is also not mentioned in [Num
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017.md), although the Gershonites and
Merarites actually marched between the banners of Judah and Reuben, and
the Kohathites with the holy things between the banners of Reuben and
Ephraim ([Num 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#017.md) and [Num
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#021).md).

(Note: As the critics do not deny that vv. 11-28 are written by the
"Elohist" notwithstanding this difference, they have no right to bring
forward the account of the ark going first as a contradiction to ch. 2,
and therefore a proof that [Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md).
are not of Elohistic origin.)

The words, "the cloud was above them" (the Israelites), and so forth,
can be reconciled with this supposition without any difficulty, whether
we understand them as signifying that the cloud, which appeared as a
guiding column floating above the ark and moved forward along with it,
also extended itself along the whole procession, and spread out as a
protecting shade over the whole army (as O. v. Gerlach and Baumgarten
suppose), or that "above them" (upon them) is to be regarded as
expressive of the fact that it accompanied them as a protection and
shade. Nor is [Psa 105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039.md), which
seems, so far as the words are concerned, rather to favour the first
explanation, really at variance with this view; for the Psalmist's
intention is not so much to give a physical description of the
phenomenon, as to describe the sheltering protection of God in poetical
words as a spreading out of the cloud above the wandering people of God,
in the form of a protection against both heat and rain (cf. [Isa
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005).md). Moreover, [Num
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md) and [Num
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#034.md) have a poetical character,
answering to the elevated nature of their subject, and are to be
interpreted as follows according to the laws of a poetical parallelism:
The one thought that the ark of the covenant, with the cloud soaring
above it, led the way and sheltered those who were marching, is divided
into two clauses; in [Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md) only
the ark of the covenant is mentioned as going in front of the
Israelites, and in [Num 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#034.md) only the
cloud as a shelter over them: whereas the carrying of the ark in front
of the army could only accomplish the end proposed, viz., to search out
a resting-place for them, by Jehovah going above them in the cloud, and
showing the bearers of the ark both the way they were to take, and the
place where they were to rest. The ark with the tables of the law is not
called "the ark of testimony" here, according to its contents, as in
[Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md); [Exo
26:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033.md); [Exo
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006.md), etc., but the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah, according to its design and signification for
Israel, which was the only point, or at any rate the principal point, in
consideration here. The resting-place which the ark of the covenant
found at the end of three days, is not mentioned in [Num
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#034.md); it was not Tabeerah, however
([Num 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#003).md), but Kibroth-hattaavah
([Num 11:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#034.md); cf. [Num
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#016).md).

[Numbers 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 10:35</span></span>

In [Num 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md) and [Num
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#036.md), the words which Moses was in
the habit of uttering, both when the ark removed and when it came to
rest again, are given not only as a proof of the joyous confidence of
Moses, but as an encouragement to the congregation to cherish the same
believing confidence. When breaking up, he said, "Rise up, Jehovah! that
Thine enemies may be scattered, and they that hate Thee may flee before
Thy face;" and when it rested, "Return, Jehovah, to the ten thousand
thousands of Israel!" Moses could speak in this way, because he knew
that Jehovah and the ark of the covenant were inseparably connected, and
saw in the ark of the covenant, as the throne of Jehovah, a material
pledge of the gracious presence of the Almighty God. He said this,
however, not merely with reference to enemies who might encounter the
Israelites in the desert, but with a confident anticipation of the
calling of Israel, to strive for the cause of the Lord in this hostile
world, and rear His kingdom upon earth. Human power was not sufficient
for this; but to accomplish this end, it was necessary that the Almighty
God should go before His people, and scatter their foes. The prayer
addressed to God to do this, is an expression of bold believing
confidence, - a prayer sure of its answer; and to Israel it was the word
with which the congregation of God was to carry on the conflict at all
times against the powers and authorities of a whole hostile world. It is
in this sense that in [Psa 68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002.md), the
words are held up by David before himself and his generation as a banner
of victory, "to arm the Church with confidence, and fortify it against
the violent attacks of its foes" (Calvin). שׁוּבה is construed with an
accusative: return to the ten thousands of the hosts of Israel, i.e.,
after having scattered Thine enemies, turn back again to Thy people to
dwell among them. The "thousands of Israel," as in [Num
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#016.md).

(Note: The inverted nuns, נ, at the beginning and close of [Num
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md), [Num
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#036.md), which are found, according to
R. Menachem's de Lonzano Or Torah (f. 17), in all the Spanish and German
MSS, and are sanctioned by the Masorah, are said by the Talmud (tract de
sabbatho) to be merely signa parentheseos, quae monerent praeter
historiae seriem versum 35 et 36 ad capitis finem inseri (cf. Matt.
Hilleri de Arcano Kethib et Keri libri duo, pp. 158, 159). The
Cabbalists, on the other hand, according to R. Menach. l. c., find an
allusion in it to the Shechinah, "quae velut obversa ad tergum facie
sequentes Israelitas ex impenso amore respiceret" (see the note in J. H.
Michaelis' Bibl. hebr.). In other MSS, however, which are supported by
the Masora Erffurt, the inverted nun is found in the words בּנסע ([Num
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035).md) and כּמתאננים העם ויהי ([Num
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001).md): the first, ad innuendum ut sic
retrorsum agantur omnes hostes Israeliarum; the second, ut esset
symbolum perpetuum perversitatis populi, inter tot illustria signa
liberationis et maximorum beneficiorum Dei acerbe quiritantium, ad
declarandam ingratitudinem et contumaciam suam (cf. J. Buxtorf,
Tiberias, p. 169).)
