### [Jonah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md)

Mission of Jonah to Nineveh His Flight and Punishment - Jonah 1

Jonah tries to avoid fulfilling the command of God, to preach repentance
to the great city Nineveh, by a rapid flight to the sea, for the purpose
of sailing to Tarshish ([Jon 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001).md);
but a terrible storm, which threatens to destroy the ship, brings his
sin to light ([Jon 1:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#004).md); and when
the lot singles him out as the culprit, he confesses that he is guilty;
and in accordance with the sentence which he pronounces upon himself, is
cast into the sea ([Jon 1:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#011).md).

[Jonah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jon 1:1</span></span>

The narrative commences with ויהי, as Ruth ([Rut
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001).md), 1 Samuel ([Sa1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001).md), and others do. This was the
standing formula with which historical events were linked on to one
another, inasmuch as every occurrence follows another in chronological
sequence; so that the Vav (and) simply attaches to a series of events,
which are assumed as well known, and by no means warrants the assumption
that the narrative which follows is merely a fragment of a larger work
(see at [Jos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001).md). The word of the
Lord which came to Jonah was this: "Arise, go to Nineveh, the great
city, and preach against it." על does not stand for אל ([Jon
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#002).md), but retains its proper meaning,
against, indicating the threatening nature of the preaching, as the
explanatory clause which follows clearly shows. The connection in [Jon
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#002.md) is a different one. Nineveh, the
capital of the Assyrian kingdom, and the residence of the great kings of
Assyria, which was built by Nimrod according to [Gen
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#011.md), and by Ninos, the mythical
founder of the Assyrian empire, according to the Greek and Roman
authors, is repeatedly called "the great city" in this book ([Jon
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#002.md); [Jon
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011).md), and its size is given as three
days' journey ([Jon 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003).md). This agrees
with the statements of classical writers, according to whom Νῖνος,
Ninus, as Greeks and Romans call it, was the largest city in the world
at that time. According to Strabo ([Rom
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md), [Rom
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003).md), it was much larger than
Babylon, and was situated in a plain, Ἀτουρίας, of Assyria i.e., on the
left bank of the Tigris. According to Ctesias (in Diod. ii. 3), its
circumference was as much as 480 stadia, i.e., twelve geographical
miles; whereas, according to Strabo, the circumference of the wall of
Babylon was not more than 365 stadia. These statements have been
confirmed by modern excavations upon the spot. The conclusion to which
recent discoveries lead is, that the name Nineveh was used in two
senses: first, for one particular city; and secondly, for a complex of
four large primeval cities (including Nineveh proper), the
circumvallation of which is still traceable, and a number of small
dwelling-places, castles, etc., the mounds (Tell) of which cover the
land. This Nineveh, in the broader sense, is bounded on three sides by
rivers - viz. on the north-west by the Khosr, on the west by the Tigris,
and on the south-west by the Gazr Su and the Upper or Great Zab - and on
the fourth side by mountains, which ascend from the rocky plateau; and
it was fortified artificially all round on the river-sides with dams,
sluices for inundating the land, and canals, and on the land side with
ramparts and castles, as we may still see from the heaps of ruins. It
formed a trapezium, the sharp angles of which lay towards the north and
south, the long sides being formed by the Tigris and the mountains. The
average length is about twenty-five English miles; the average breadth
fifteen. The four large cities were situated on the edge of the
trapezium, Nineveh proper (including the ruins of Kouyunjik, Nebbi
Yunas, and Ninua) being at the north-western corner, by the Tigris; the
city, which was evidently the later capital (Nimrud), and which
Rawlinson, Jones, and Oppert suppose to have been Calah, at the
south-western corner, between Tigris and Zab; a third large city, which
is now without a name, and has been explored last of all, but within the
circumference of which the village of Selamiyeh now stands, on the
Tigris itself, from three to six English miles to the north of Nimrud;
and lastly, the citadel and temple-mass, which is now named Khorsabad,
and is said to be called Dur-Sargina in the inscriptions, from the
palace built there by Sargon, on the Khosr, pretty near to the
north-eastern corner (compare M. v. Niebuhr, Geschichte Assurs, p.
274ff., with the ground-plan of the city of Nineveh, p. 284). But
although we may see from this that Nineveh could very justly be called
the great city, Jonah does not apply this epithet to it with the
intention of pointing out to his countrymen its majestic size, but, as
the expression gedōlâh lē'lōhı̄m in [Jon
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003.md) clearly shows, and as we may see
still more clearly from [Jon 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011.md),
with reference to the importance which Nineveh had, both in the eye of
God, and with regard to the divine commission which he had received, as
the capital of the Gentile world, quae propter tot animarum multitudinem
Deo curae erat (Michaelis). Jonah was to preach against this great
Gentile city, because its wickedness had come before Jehovah, i.e.,
because the report or the tidings of its great corruption had penetrated
to God in heaven (cf. [Gen 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021.md); [Sa1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#012).md).

[Jonah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jon 1:3</span></span>

Jonah sets out upon his journey; not to Nineveh, however, but to flee to
Tarshish, i.e., Tartessus, a Phoenician port in Spain (see at [Gen
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#004.md) and [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001).md), "from the face of Jehovah,"
i.e., away from the presence of the Lord, out of the land of Israel,
where Jehovah dwelt in the temple, and manifested His presence (cf. [Gen
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016).md); not to hide himself from the
omnipresent God, but to withdraw from the service of Jehovah, the
God-King of Israel.

(Note: Marck has already correctly observed, that "this must not be
understood as flight from the being and knowledge of God, lest we should
attribute to the great prophet gross ignorance of the omnipresence and
omniscience of God; but as departure from the land of Canaan, the
gracious seat of God, outside which he thought, that possibly, at any
rate at that time, the gift and office of a prophet would not be
conferred upon him.")

The motive for this flight was not fear of the difficulty of carrying
out the command of God, but, as Jonah himself says in [Jon
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002.md), anxiety lest the compassion of
God should spare the sinful city in the event of its repenting. He had
no wish to co-operate in this; and that not merely because "he knew, by
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that the repentance of the Gentiles
would be the ruin of the Jews, and, as a lover of his country, was
actuated not so much by envy of the salvation of Nineveh, as by
unwillingness that his own people should perish," as Jerome supposes,
but also because he really grudged salvation to the Gentiles, and feared
lest their conversion to the living God should infringe upon the
privileges of Israel above the Gentile world, and put an end to its
election as the nation of God.

(Note: Luther has already deduced this, the only true reason, from [Jon
4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001.md), in his Commentary on the
Prophet Jonah: "Because Jonah was sorry that God was so kind, he would
rather not preach, yea, would rather die, than that the grace of God,
which was to be the peculiar privilege of the people of Israel, should
be communicated to the Gentiles also, who had neither the word of God,
nor the laws of Moses, nor the worship of God, nor prophets, nor
anything else, but rather strove against God, and His word, and His
people." But in order to guard against a false estimate of the prophet,
on account of these "carnal, Jewish thoughts of God," Luther directs
attention to the fact that "the apostles also held at first the carnal
opinion that the kingdom of Christ was to be an outward one; and even
afterwards, when they understood that it was to be a spiritual one, they
thought that it was to embrace only the Jews, and therefore 'preached
the gospel to the Jews only' (Acts 8), until God enlightened them by a
vision from heaven to Peter (Acts 10), and by the public calling of Paul
and Barnabas (Acts 13), and by wonders and signs; and it was at last
resolved by a general council (Acts 15), that God would also show mercy
to the Gentiles, and that He was the God of the Gentiles also. For it
was very hard for the Jews to believe that there were any other people
outside Israel who helped to form the people of God, because the sayings
of the Scripture stop there and speak of Israel and Abraham's seed; and
the word of God, the worship of God, the laws and the holy prophets,
were with them alone.")

He therefore betook himself to Yāphō, i.e., Joppa, the port on the
Mediterranean Sea (vid., comm. on [Jos
19:46](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#046).md), and there found a ship which
was going to Tarshish; and having paid the sekhârâh, the hire of the
ship, i.e., the fare for the passage, embarked "to go with them (i.e.,
the sailors) to Tarshish."

[Jonah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jon 1:4</span></span>

Jonah's foolish hope of being able to escape from the Lord was
disappointed. "Jehovah threw a great wind (i.e., a violent wind) upon
the sea." A mighty tempest (סער, rendered appropriately κλύδων by the
lxx) arose, so that "the ship thought to be dashed to pieces," i.e., to
be wrecked (השּׁב used of inanimate things, equivalent to "was very
nearly" wrecked). In this danger the seamen (mallâch, a denom. of
melach, the salt flood) cried for help, "every one to his god." They
were heathen, and probably for the most part Phoenicians, but from
different places, and therefore worshippers of different gods. But as
the storm did not abate, they also resorted to such means of safety as
they had at command. They "threw the waves in the ship into the sea, to
procure relief to themselves" (להקל מעליהם as in [Exo
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#022.md) and [Kg1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#010).md). The suffix refers to the
persons, not to the things. By throwing the goods overboard, they hoped
to preserve the ship from sinking beneath the swelling waves, and
thereby to lighten, i.e., diminish for themselves the danger of
destruction which was so burdensome to them. "But Jonah had gone down
into the lower room of the ship, and had there fallen fast asleep;" not,
however, just at the time of the greatest danger, but before the wind
had risen into a dangerous storm. The sentence is to be rendered as a
circumstantial one in the pluperfect. Yarkethē hassephı̄nâh (analogous to
harkethē habbayith in [Amo 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010).md) is
the innermost part of the vessel, i.e., the lower room of the ship.
Sephı̄nâh, which only occurs here, and is used in the place of אניּה, is
the usual word for a ship in Arabic and Aramaean. Nirdam: used for deep
sleep, as in [Jdg 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#021.md). This act of
Jonah's is regarded by most commentators as a sign of an evil
conscience. Marck supposes that he had lain down to sleep, hoping the
better to escape either the dangers of sea and air, or the hand of God;
others, that he had thrown himself down in despair, and being utterly
exhausted and giving himself up for lost, had fallen asleep; or as
Theodoret expresses it, being troubled with the gnawings of conscience
and overpowered with mourning, he had sought comfort in sleep and fallen
into a deep sleep. Jerome, on the other hand, expresses the idea that
the words indicate "security of mind" on the part of the prophet: "he is
not disturbed by the storm and the surrounding dangers, but has the same
composed mind in the calm, or with shipwreck at hand;" and whilst the
rest are calling upon their gods, and casting their things overboard,
"he is so calm, and feels so safe with his tranquil mind, that he goes
down to the interior of the ship and enjoys a most placid sleep." The
truth probably lies between these two views. It was not an evil
conscience, or despair occasioned by the threatening danger, which
induced him to lie down to sleep; nor was it his fearless composure in
the midst of the dangers of the storm, but the careless self-security
with which he had embarked on the ship to flee from God, without
considering that the hand of God could reach him even on the sea, and
punish him for his disobedience. This security is apparent in his
subsequent conduct.

[Jonah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jon 1:6</span></span>

When the danger was at its height, the upper-steersman, or ship's
captain (rabh hachōbhēl, the chief of the ship's governors; chōbhēl with
the article is a collective noun, and a denom. from chebhel, a ship's
cable, hence the one who manages, steers, or guides the ship), wakes him
with the words, "How canst thou sleep soundly? Arise, and call upon thy
God; perhaps God (hâ'ĕlōhı̄m with the article, 'the true God') will think
of us, that we may not perish." The meaning of יתעשּׁת is disputed. As
עשׁת is used in [Jer 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md) in the sense
of shining (viz., of fat), Calvin and others (last of all, Hitzig) have
maintained that the hithpael has the meaning, shown himself shining,
i.e., bright (propitious); whilst others, including Jerome, prefer the
meaning think again, which is apparently better supported than the
former, not only by the Chaldee, but also by the nouns עשׁתּוּת ([Job
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#005).md) and עשׁתּון ([Psa
146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004).md). God's thinking of a person
involves the idea of active assistance. For the thought itself, compare
Ps. 40:18. The fact that Jonah obeyed this awakening call is passed over
as self-evident; and in [Jon 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#007.md) the
narrative proceeds to relate, that as the storm had not abated in the
meantime, the sailors, firmly believing that some one in the ship had
committed a crime which had excited the anger of God that was
manifesting itself in the storm, had recourse to the lot to find out the
culprit. בּשׁלּמי = בּאשׁר למי ([Jon
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#008).md), as שׁ is the vulgar, and in
conversation the usual contraction for אשׁר: "on account of whom"
(בּאשׁר, in this that = because, or followed by ל, on account of). הרעה,
the misfortune (as in [Amo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006).md), -
namely, the storm which is threatening destruction. The lot fell upon
Jonah. "The fugitive is taken by lot, not from any virtue in lots
themselves, least of all the lots of heathen, but by the will of Him who
governs uncertain lots" (Jerome).

When Jonah had been singled out by the lot as the culprit, the sailors
called upon him to confess his guilt, asking him at the same time about
his country, his occupation, and his parentage. The repetition of the
question, on whose account this calamity had befallen them, which is
omitted in the lxx (Vatic.), the Socin. prophets, and Cod. 195 of
Kennicott, is found in the margin in Cod. 384, and is regarded by Grimm
and Hitzig as a marginal gloss that has crept into the text. It is not
superfluous, however; still less does it occasion any confusion; on the
contrary, it is quite in order. The sailors wanted thereby to induce
Jonah to confess with his own mouth that he was guilty, now that the lot
had fallen upon him, and to disclose his crime (Ros. and others). As an
indirect appeal to confess his crime, it prepares the way for the
further inquiries as to his occupation, etc. They inquired about this
occupation, because it might be a disreputable one, and one which
excited the wrath of the gods; also about his parentage, and especially
about the land and people from which he sprang, that they might be able
to pronounce a safe sentence upon his crime.

[Jonah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jon 1:9</span></span>

Jonah begins by answering the last question, saying that he was "a
Hebrew," - the name by which the Israelites designated themselves in
contradistinction to other nations, and by which other nations
designated them (see at [Gen 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013.md),
and my Lehrbuch der Einleitung, 9, Anm. 2) - and that he worshipped "the
God of heaven, who created the sea and the dry" (i.e., the land). ירא
has been rendered correctly by the lxx σέβομαι, colo, revereor; and does
not mean, "I am afraid of Jehovah, against whom I have sinned"
(Abarbanel). By the statement, "I fear," etc., he had no intention of
describing himself as a righteous or innocent man (Hitzig), but simply
meant to indicate his relation to God - namely, that he adored the
living God who created the whole earth and, as Creator, governed the
world. For he admits directly after, that he has sinned against this
God, by telling them, as we may see from [Jon
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#010.md), of his flight from Jehovah. He
had not told them this as soon as he embarked in the ship, as Hitzig
supposes, but does so now for the first time when they ask about his
people, his country, etc., as we may see most unmistakeably from [Jon
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#010.md). In [Jon
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009.md) Jonah's statement is not given
completely; but the principal fact, viz., that he was a Hebrew and
worshipped Jehovah, is followed immediately by the account of the
impression which this acknowledgement made upon the heathen sailors; and
the confession of his sin is mentioned afterwards as a supplement, to
assign the reason for the great fear which came upon the sailors in
consequence. מה־זּאת עשׂית, What hast thou done! is not a question as to
the nature of his sin, but an exclamation of horror at his flight from
Jehovah, the God heaven and earth, as the following explanatory clauses
כּי ידעוּ וגו clearly show. The great fear which came upon the heathen
seamen at this confession of Jonah may be fully explained from the
dangerous situation in which they found themselves, since the storm
preached the omnipotence of God more powerfully than words could
possibly do.

[Jonah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jon 1:11</span></span>

Fearing as they did in the storm the wrath of God on account of Jonah's
sin, they now asked what they should do, that the storm might abate,
"for the sea continued to rage." שׁתק, to set itself, to come to a state
of repose; or with מעל, to desist from a person. הולך, as in [Gen
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#005.md), etc., expressive of the
continuance of an action. With their fear of the Almighty God, whom
Jonah worshipped, they did not dare to inflict a punishment upon the
prophet, simply according to their own judgment. As a worshipper of
Jehovah, he should pronounce his own sentence, or let it be pronounced
by his God. Jonah replies in [Jon
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#012.md), "Cast me into the sea; for I
know that for my sake this great storm is (come) upon you." As Jerome
says, "He does not refuse, or prevaricate, or deny; but, having made
confession concerning his flight, he willingly endures the punishment,
desiring to perish, and not let others perish on his account." Jonah
confesses that he has deserved to die for his rebellion against God, and
that the wrath of God which has manifested itself in the storm can only
be appeased by his death. He pronounces this sentence, not by virtue of
any prophetic inspiration, but as a believing Israelite who is well
acquainted with the severity of the justice of the holy God, both from
the law and from the history of his nation.

[Jonah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jon 1:13</span></span>

But the men (the seamen) do not venture to carry out this sentence at
once. They try once more to reach the land and escape from the storm,
which is threatening them with destruction, without so serious a
sacrifice. יחתּרוּ, lit., they broke through, sc. through the waves, to
bring (the ship) back to the land, i.e., they tried to reach the land by
rowing and steering. Châthar does not mean to row, still less to twist
or turn round (Hitzig), but to break through; here to break through the
waves, to try to overcome them, to which the παρεβιάζοντο of the lxx
points. As they could not accomplish this, however, because the sea
continued to rage against them (סער עליהם, was raging against them),
they prayed thus to Jehovah: "We beseech Thee, let us not (אנּא = אל־נא)
perish for the sake of the soul of this man (בּנפשׁ, lit., for the soul,
as in [Sa2 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#007.md) after [Deu
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#021).md), and lay not upon us innocent
blood," - that is to say, not "do not let us destroy an innocent man in
the person of this man" (Hitzig), but, according to [Deu
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#008.md), "do not impute his death to us,
if we cast him into the sea, as bloodguiltiness deserving death;" "for
Thou, O Jehovah, hast done as it pleased Thee," - namely, inasmuch as,
by sending the storm and determining the lot, Thou hast so ordained that
we must cast him into the sea as guilty, in order to expiate Thy wrath.
They offer this prayer, not because they have no true conception of the
guilt of Jonah, who is not a murderer or blasphemer, inasmuch as
according to their notions, he is not a sinner deserving death (Hitzig),
but because they regard Jonah as a prophet or servant of the Almighty
God, upon whom, from fear of his God, they do not venture to lay their
hand. "We see, therefore, that although they had never enjoyed the
teaching of the law, they had been so taught by nature, that they knew
very well that the blood of man was dear to God, and precious in His
sight" (Calvin).

[Jonah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jon 1:15</span></span>

After they had prayed thus, they cast Jonah into the sea, and "the sea
stood still (ceased) from its raging." The sudden cessation of the storm
showed that the bad weather had come entirely on Jonah's account, and
that the sailors had not shed innocent blood by casting him into the
sea. In this sudden change in the weather, the arm of the holy God was
so suddenly manifested, that the sailors "feared Jehovah with great
fear, and offered sacrifice to Jehovah" - not after they landed, but
immediately, on board the ship - "and vowed vows," i.e., vowed that they
would offer Him still further sacrifices on their safe arrival at their
destination.

[Jonah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jon 1:17</span></span>

(Heb. Ch. 2:1). "And Jehovah appointed a great fish to swallow up
Jonah." מנּה does not mean to create, but to determine, to appoint. The
thought is this: Jehovah ordained that a great fish should swallow him.
The great fish (lxx κῆτος, cf. [Mat
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040).md), which is not more precisely
defined, was not a whale, because this is extremely rare in the
Mediterranean, and has too small a throat to swallow a man, but a large
shark or sea-dog, canis carcharias, or squalus carcharias L., which is
very common in the Mediterranean, and has so large a throat, that it can
swallow a living man whole.

(Note: The aqualus carcharias L., the true shark, Requin, or rather
Requiem, reaches, according to Cuvier, the length of 25 feet, and
according to Oken the length of four fathoms, and has about 400
lance-shaped teeth in its jaw, arranged in six rows, which the animal
can either elevate or depress, as they are simply fixed in cells in the
skin. It is common in the Mediterranean, where it generally remains in
deep water, and is very voracious, swallowing everything that comes in
its way - plaice, seals, and tunny-fish, with which it sometimes gets
into the fishermen's net on the coat of Sardinia, and is caught. As many
as a dozen undigested tunny-fish have been found in a shark weighing
three or four hundredweight; in one a whole horse was found, and its
weight was estimated at fifteen hundredweight. Rondelet (Oken, p. 58)
says that he saw one on the western coast of France, through whose
throat a fat man could very easily have passed. Oken also mentions a
fact, which is more elaborately described in Mller's Vollstndiges
Natur-system des Ritters Carl v. Linn (Th. iii. p. 268), namely, that in
the year 1758 a sailor fell overboard from a frigate, in very stormy
weather, into the Mediterranean Sea, and was immediately taken into the
jaws of a sea-dog (carcharias), and disappeared. The captain, however,
ordered a gun, which was standing on the deck, to be discharged at the
shark, and the cannon-ball struck it, so that it vomited up again the
sailor that it had swallowed, who was then taken up alive, and very
little hurt, into the boat that had been lowered for his rescue.)

The miracle consisted therefore, not so much in the fact that Jonah was
swallowed alive, as in the fact that he was kept alive for three days in
the shark's belly, and then vomited unhurt upon the land. The three days
and three nights are not to be regarded as fully three times twenty
hours, but are to be interpreted according to Hebrew usage, as
signifying that Jonah was vomited up again on the third day after he had
been swallowed (compare [Est 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md) with
[Est 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md) and Tob. 3:12, 13, according
to the Lutheran text).
