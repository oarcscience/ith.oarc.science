### [1 Chronicles Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 26:1</span></span>

The classes of the doorkeepers, the stewards of the treasures of the
sanctuary, and the officers for the external business. - Vv. 1-19. The
classes of the doorkeepers. [Ch1 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md).
The superscription runs shortly thus: "As to (ל) the divisions of the
doorkeepers." The enumeration beings with לקרחים: to the Korahites
(belongs) Meshelemiah (in [Ch1 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014.md),
Shelemiah). Instead of אסף מן־בּני we should read, according to [Ch1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md), אביסף מן־בּני, for the Korahites
are descended from Kohath ([Exo 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#021.md);
[Exo 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#016).md), but Asaph is a descendant
of Gershon ([Ch1 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039)..md). - In [Ch1
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#002.md), [Ch1
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#003.md), seven sons of Meshelemiah are
enumerated; the first-born Zechariah is mentioned also in [Ch1
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#021.md), and was entrusted, according to
[Ch1 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014.md), with the guarding of the
north side.

[1 Chronicles 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 26:4</span></span>

Obed-edom's family. Obed-edom has been already mentioned in [Ch1
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038.md) and [Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024.md) as doorkeeper; see the
commentary on the passage. From our passage we learn that Obed-edom
belonged to the Kohathite family of the Korahites. According to [Ch1
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#019.md), the doorkeepers were Korahites
and Merarites. The Merarites, however, are only treated of from [Ch1
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#010.md) and onwards. אדם וּלעבד ([Ch1
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#004).md) corresponds to ולמשׁלמיהוּ ([Ch1
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#002).md), and is consequently thereby
brought under לקּרהים ([Ch1 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001).md).
Here, [Ch1 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#004.md), [Ch1
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#005.md), eight sons with whom God had
blessed him (cf. [Ch1 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#014).md), and in
[Ch1 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#006.md) and [Ch1
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#007.md) his grandchildren, are
enumerated. The verb נולד is used in the singular, with a subject
following in the plural, as frequently (cf. Ew. 316, a). The
grandchildren of Obed-edom by his first-born son Shemaiah are
characterized as המּמשׁלים, the dominions, i.e., the lords (rulers) of
the house of their fathers (ממשׁל, the abstract dominion, for the
concrete משׁל; cf. Ew. 160, b), because they were חיל גּבּורי, valiant
heroes, and so qualified for the office of doorkeepers. In the
enumeration in [Ch1 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#007.md), the omission
of the ו cop. with אחיו אלזבד is strange; probably we must supply ו
before both words, and take them thus: And Elzabad and his brethren,
valiant men, (viz.) Elihu and Semachiah. For the conjecture that the
names of the אחיו are not given (Berth.) is not a very probable one.

[1 Chronicles 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 26:8</span></span>

The whole number of doorkeepers of Obed-edom's family, his sons and
brethren, was sixty-two; able men with strength for the service. The
singular חיל אישׁ, after the preceding plural, is most simply explained
by taking it to be in apposition to the כּל at the beginning of the
verse, by repeating כּל mentally before אישׁ. - In [Ch1
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#009.md) the number of Meshelemiah's sons
and brothers is brought in in a supplementary way.

[1 Chronicles 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 26:10</span></span>

The Merarites. Hosah's sons and brothers. חוסה has been already
mentioned ([Ch1 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038).md) along with
Obed-edom as doorkeeper. Hosah made Shimri head of the Merarites, who
served as doorkeepers, because there was no first-born, i.e., because
his first-born son had died without leaving any descendant, so that none
of the families descended from Hosah had the natural claim to the
birthright. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.
Meshelemiah had eighteen (cf. [Ch1
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#009).md), and Obed-edom sixty-two ([Ch1
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#008).md); and all taken together they
make ninety-three, whom we are (according to [Ch1
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#012)..md) to regard as the heads of the
4000 doorkeepers. In [Ch1 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md) the
number of the doorkeepers appointed by David is stated to be 212, but
that number most probably refers to a different time (see on [Ch1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022).md). Bertheau further remarks:
"According to [Ch1 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038.md), sixty-eight
are reckoned to Obed-edom and Hosah, in our passage seventy-five; and
the small difference between the numbers is explained by the fact that
in the first passage only the doorkeepers before the ark are referred
to." Against this we have already shown, in our remarks on [Ch1
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038.md), that the number there mentioned
cannot be held with certainty to refer to the doorkeepers.

[1 Chronicles 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 26:12</span></span>

The division of the doorkeepers according to their posts of service.
[Ch1 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#012.md). "To these classes of
doorkeepers, viz., to the heads of the men, (were committed) the
watches, in common with their brethren, to serve in the house of Jahve."
By מחלקות לאלּה it is placed beyond doubt that the above-mentioned names
and numbers give us the classes of the doorkeepers. By the apposition
הגּברים לראשׁי, the meaning of which is discussed in the commentary on
[Ch1 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#004.md), השׁ מחלקות is so defined as
to show that properly the heads of the households are meant, only these
having been enumerated in the preceding section, and not the classes.

[Ch1 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#013.md)

The distribution of the stations by lot followed (cf. [Ch1
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#008).md), the small as the great; i.e.,
the younger as the older cast lots, according to their fathers'-houses,
"for door and door," i.e., for each door of the four sides of the
temple, which was built so that its sides corresponded to the points of
the compass.

[Ch1 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014.md)

The lot towards the east, i.e., for the guarding of the east side, fell
to Shelemiah (cf. [Ch1 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md), [Ch1
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#002).md); while that towards the north
fell to his first-born Zechariah. Before זכריהוּ, ל is to be repeated.
To him the title בּשׂכל יויץ is given, for reasons unknown to us. גו
הפּילוּ, (for him) they threw lots.

[Ch1 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#015.md)

To Obed-edom (fell the lot) towards the south, and to his sons it fell
(to guard) the house Asuppim. As to בּית־האספּים, called for brevity
עספּים in [Ch1 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#017.md), i.e., house of
collections or provisions (cf. [Neh
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#025).md), we can say nothing further
than that it was a building used for the storing of the temple goods,
situated in the neighbourhood of the southern door of the temple in the
external court, and that it probably had two entrances, since in [Ch1
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#019.md) it is stated that two
guard-stations were assigned to it.

[Ch1 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#016.md)

The word לשׁפּים is unintelligible, and probably has come into the text
merely by a repetition of the two last syllables of the preceding word,
since the name שׁפּים ([Ch1 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#012).md) has
no connection with this passage. To Hosah fell the lot towards the west,
by the door Shallecheth on the ascending highway. העולה המסלּה is the
way which led from the lower city up to the more lofty temple site.
Instead of the door on this highway, in [Ch1
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#018.md), in the statement as to the
distribution of the guard-stations, Parbar is named, and the highway
distinguished from it, four doorkeepers being appointed for the מסלּה,
and two for פּרבּר. פּרבּר .פּר, probably identical with פּרורים, [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md), a word of uncertain meaning,
was the name of an out-building on the western side, the back of the
outer court of the temple by the door Shallecheth, which contained cells
for the laying up of temple goods and furniture. שׁלּכת, Bttcher
translates, Proben, S. 347, "refuse-door;" see on [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md). Nothing more definite can be
said of it, unless we hold, with Thenius on [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md), that Ezekiel's temple is in all
its details a copy of the Solomonic temple, and use it, in an
unjustifiable way, as a source of information as to the prae-exilic
temple. משׁמר לעמּת משׁמר (as in [Neh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#024)), guard with (over against?.md)
guard, or one guard as the other (cf. on לעמּת, [Ch1
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#012.md) and [Ch1
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#008).md), Bertheau connects with Hosah,
according to the Masoretic punctuation, and explains it thus: "Because
it was Hosah's duty to set guards before the western gate of the temple,
and also before the gate Shallecheth, which lay over against it."
Clericus, on the contrary, refers the words to all the guard-stations:
cum ad omnes januas essent custodiae, sibi ex adverso respondebant. This
reference, according to which the words belong to what follows, and
introduce the statement as to the number of guards at the individual
posts which follows in [Ch1 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#017.md).,
seems to deserve the preference. So much is certain in any case, that
there is no ground in the text for distinguishing the gate Shallecheth
from the western gate of the temple, for the two gates are not
distinguished either in [Ch1 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#016.md) or
in [Ch1 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#018.md).

[Ch1 26:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#017.md)

Settlement of the number of guard-stations at the various sides and
places. Towards morning (on the east side) were six of the Levites (six
kept guard); towards the north by day (i.e., daily, on each day), four;
towards the south daily, four; and at the storehouse two and two,
consequently four also; at Parbar towards the west, four on the highway
and two at Parbar, i.e., six. In all, therefore, there were twenty-four
guard-stations to be occupied daily; but more than twenty-four persons
were required, because, even supposing that one man at a time was
sufficient for each post, one man could not stand the whole day at it:
he must have been relieved from time to time. Probably, however, there
were always more than one person on guard at each post. It further
suggests itself that the number twenty-four may be in some way connected
with the divisions or classes of doorkeepers; but there is only a
deceptive appearance of a connection. The division of the priests and
musicians each into twenty-four classes respectively is no sufficient
analogy in the case, for these classes had to perform the service in
succession each for a week at a time, while the twenty-four doorkeepers'
stations had to be all occupied simultaneously every day. - In [Ch1
26:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#002.md), then, twenty-eight heads in
all are enumerated by name (Meshelemiah with seven sons, Obed-edom with
eight sons and six grandsons, and Hosah with four sons); but the total
number in all the three families of doorkeepers is stated at
ninety-three, and neither the one nor the other of these numbers bears
any relation to twenty-four. Finally, the posts are so distributed that
Meshelemiah with his eighteen sons and brothers kept guard on the east
and north sides with six posts; Obed-edom with his sixty-two sons and
brothers on the south side with four and 2 x 2, that is, eight posts;
and Hosah with his thirteen sons and brothers on the western side with
four and two, that is, six; so that even here no symmetrical
distribution of the service can be discovered.

[Ch1 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#019.md)

Subscription, in which it is again stated that the classes of
doorkeepers were taken from among the Korahites and Merarites.

[1 Chronicles 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 26:20</span></span>

The stewards of the treasures of the sanctuary. - [Ch1
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020.md) appears to contain the
superscription of the succeeding section. For here the treasures of the
house of God and the treasures of the consecrated things are grouped
together, while in [Ch1 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#022.md) and [Ch1
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#026.md) they are separated, and placed
under the oversight of two Levite families: the treasures of the house
of Jahve under the sons of the Gershonite Laadan ([Ch1
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#021.md), [Ch1
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#022).md); the treasures of the
consecrated things under the charge of the Amramites. But with this the
words אחיּה הלויּם cannot be made to harmonize. According to the
Masoretic accentuation, הלויּם alone would be the superscription; but
הלויּם alone gives no suitable sense, for the Levites have been treated
of already from 1 Chron 23 onwards. Moreover, it appears somewhat
strange that there is no further characterization of אחיּה, for the name
is a very common one, but has not before occurred in our chapter, whence
we would expect a statement of his descent and his family, such as we
find in the case of the succeeding chief overseers. All these things
tend to throw doubt upon the correctness of the Masoretic reading, while
the lxx, on the contrary, in καὶ οἱ Δευῖται ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τῶν
θησαυρῶν κ.τ.λ, give a perfectly suitable superscription, which involves
the reading אחיהם instead of אחיּה. This reading we, with J. D. Mich.
and Berth., hold to be the original. On אהיהם הלויּם, cf. [Ch1
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#029.md); [Ch2
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md).

[Ch1 26:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#021.md)

[Ch1 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#021.md) and [Ch1
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#022.md) to together: "The sons of
Laadan, (namely) the sons of the Gershonite family which belong to
Laadan, (namely) the heads of the fathers'-houses of Laadan of the
Gershonite family: Jehieli, (namely) the sons of Jehieli, Zetham and his
brother Joel (see [Ch1 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007).md), were
over the treasures of the house of Jahve." The meaning is this: "Over
the treasures of the house of Jahve were Zetham and Joel, the heads of
the father's-house of Jehieli, which belonged to the Laadan branch of
the Gershonites." Light is thrown upon these words, so obscure through
their brevity, by [Ch1 23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007.md),
according to which the sons of Jehiel, or the Jehielites, are descended
from Laadan, the older branch of the Gershonites. This descent is
briefly but fully stated in the three clauses of the 21st verse, each of
which contains a more definite characterization of the father's-house
Jehieli, whose two heads Zetham and Joel were entrusted with the
oversight of the treasures of the house of God.

[Ch1 26:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#023.md)

[Ch1 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#023.md) and [Ch1
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#024.md) also go together: "As to the
Amramites, Jisharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites (the four chief
branches of the Kohathite family of Levites, [Ch1
23:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#015).md), Shebuel the son of Gershon,
the son of Moses, was prince over the treasures" (w before Shebuel
introduces the apodosis, cf. Ew. 348, a, and = Germ. "so war").

[Ch1 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#025.md)

"And his (Shebuel's) brethren of Eliezer were Rehabiah his (Eliezer's)
son, and Jeshaiah his son, ... and Shelomoth his son." These descendants
of Eliezer were called brethren of Shebuel, because they were descended
through Eliezer from Moses, as Shebuel was through his father Gershon.

[Ch1 26:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#026.md)

This Shelomoth (a descendant of Eliezer, and so to be distinguished both
from the Jisharite Shelomith [Ch1
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#018.md) and [Ch1
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#022.md), and the Gershonite of the same
name [Ch1 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#009).md), and his brethren were
over the treasures of the consecrated things which David the king had
consecrated, and the heads of the fathers'-houses, etc. Instead of לשׂרי
we must read ושׁרי, according to [Ch1
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#006.md). The princes over the thousands
and hundreds are the war captains, and the הצּבא שׂרי are the
commanders-in-chief, e.g., Abner, Joab, [Ch1
27:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#034.md), [Sa2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016.md); [Ch1
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#015.md). - The 27th verse is an
explanatory parenthesis: "from the wars and from the booty," i.e., from
the booty taken in war had they consecrated. לחזּק, to make strong,
i.e., to preserve in strength and good condition the house of Jahve.
חזּק elsewhere of the renovation of old buildings, [Kg2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#008.md)., [Neh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#002.md)., here in a somewhat general
signification. - In [Ch1 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#028.md) the
enumeration of those who had consecrated, thus interrupted, is resumed,
but in the form of a new sentence, which concludes with a predicate of
its own. In ההקדּישׁ the article represents אשׁר, as in [Ch1
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#017.md); [Ch2
29:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#036.md), and elsewhere; cf. Ew. 331, b.
With המּקדּישׁ כּל, all who had consecrated, the enumeration is
concluded, and the predicate, "was at the hand of Shelomith and his
brethren," is then brought in. על־יד, laid upon the hand, i.e.,
entrusted to them for preservation; Germ. unter der Hand (under the
hand).

If we glance back at the statements as to the stewards of the treasures
([Ch1 26:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020).md), we find that the
treasures of the house of Jahve were under the oversight of the
Jehielites Zetham and Joel, with their brethren, a branch of the
Gershonites (v. 22); and the treasures of the consecrated things under
the oversight of the Kohathite Shelomith, who was of the family of
Moses' second son Eliezer, with his brethren (v. 28). But in what
relation does the statement in v. 24, that Shebuel, the descendant of
Moses through Gershon, was על־האצרות נגיד, stand to this? Bertheau
thinks "that three kinds of treasures are distinguished, the guarding of
which was committed to different officials: (1) The sons of Jehieli,
Zetham and Joel, had the oversight of the treasures of the house of God,
which, as we may conclude from [Ch1
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#008.md), had been collected by voluntary
gifts: (2) Shebuel was prince over the treasures, perhaps over the sums
which resulted from regular assessment for the temple ([Exo
30:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011).md), from redemption-money,
e.g., for the first-born ([Num
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016).), or for vows (Lev.md);
consequently over a part of the sums which are designated in [Kg2
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#005) by the name הקדשים כסף: (3.md)
Shelomith and his brothers had the oversight of all the הקדשים אוצרות,
i.e., of the consecrated gifts which are called in [Kg2
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#019.md) קדשים, and distinguished from
the קדשים כסף in [Kg2 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#005.md)." But this
view has no support in the text. Both in the superscription ([Ch1
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020).md) and in the enumeration ([Ch1
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#022.md), [Ch1
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#026).md) only two kinds of
treasures-treasures of the house of God (of Jahve), and treasures of the
קדשׁים - are mentioned. Neither by the facts nor by the language used
are we justified in supposing that there was a third kind of treasures,
viz., the sums resulting from the regular assessment for the holy place.
For it is thoroughly arbitrary to confine the treasures of the house of
God to the voluntary contributions and the consecrated gifts given from
the war-booty; and it is still more arbitrary to limit the treasures
over which Shebuel was prince to the sums flowing into the temple
treasures from the regular assessment; for the reference to [Kg2
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#019.md) and [Kg2
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#005.md) is no proof of this, because,
though two kinds of קדשׁים are there distinguished, yet both are further
defined. The quite general expression האצרות, the treasures, can
naturally be referred only to the two different kinds of treasures
distinguished in [Ch1 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#022.md). This
reference is also demanded by the words נגיד...שׁבוּאל ([Ch1
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#024).md). Heads of fathers'-houses, with
their brethren (אהיהם), are mentioned as guardians of the two kinds of
treasures spoken of in [Ch1 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020.md);
while here, on the contrary, we have Shebuel alone, without assistants.
Further, the other guardians are not called נגיד, as Shebuel is. The
word נגיד denotes not an overseer or steward, but only princes of
kingdoms (kings), princes of tribes ([Ch1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#027.md); [Ch1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001.md); [Ch1
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016.md); [Ch2
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021).md), ministers of the palace and
the temple, and commanders-in-chief ([Ch2
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#011.md); [Ch2
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#007).md), and is consequently used in our
section neither of Zetham and Joel, nor of Shelomoth. The calling of
Shebuel נגיד consequently shows that he was the chief guardian of the
sacred treasures, under whose oversight the guardians of the two
different kinds of treasures were placed. This is stated in [Ch1
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#023.md), [Ch1
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#024.md); and the statement would not
have been misunderstood if it had been placed at the beginning or the
end of the enumeration; and its position in the middle between the
Gershonites and the Kohathites is explained by the fact that this prince
was, according to [Ch1 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#016.md), the head
of the four Levite families descended from Kohath.

The officials for the external business. - [Ch1
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029.md). "As to the Izharites, Chenaniah
(see on [Ch1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#022).md) with his sons was
for the outward business over Israel for scribes and judges." According
to this, the external business of the Levites consisted of service as
scribes and judges, for which David had set apart 6000 Levites ([Ch1
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004).md). Without sufficient reason,
Bertheau would refer the external business to the exaction of the dues
for the temple, because in [Neh 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#016.md)
ההיצנה המּלאכה for the temple is spoken of. But it does not at all
follow that in our verse the external work had any reference to the
temple, and that the scribes and judges had only this narrow sphere of
action, since here, instead of the house of God, ישׂראל על is mentioned
as the object with which the external service was connected.

[Ch1 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#030.md)

Of Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, 1700 valiant men, were ישׂ
פּקדּת על, for the oversight (inspection) of Israel this side Jordan,
for all the business of Jahve and the service of the king. Bertheau
takes פּקדּה to mean "due," "fixed tribute," a meaning which the word
cannot be shown to have. The lxx have translated correctly, ἐπὶ τῆς
ἐπισκέψεως τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, ad inspectionem Israelis, i.e., praefecti erant
(J. H. Mich.). For פּקדּת על is in [Ch1
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#032.md) rendered by על יפקיד. ליּרדּן
מעבר is shown by the addition מערבה to refer to the land of Canaan, as
in [Jos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md); [Jos
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#007.md), since Israel, both under Joshua
and also after the exile, had come from the eastward over Jordan into
Canaan. The words מלאכת and עבדת are synonymous, and are consequently
both represented in [Ch1 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#032.md) by
דּבר.

[Ch1 26:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#031.md)

David set another branch of the Hebronites, under the head Jeriah (cf.
[Ch1 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#009).md), over the East-Jordan
tribes. Between the words "Jeriah the head," [Ch1
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#031.md), and ואחיו, [Ch1
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#032.md), a parenthesis is inserted,
which gives the reason why David made these Hebronites scribes and
judges among the East-Jordan tribes. The parenthesis runs thus: "As to
the Hebronites, according to their generations, according to fathers,
they were sought out in the fortieth year of David's rule, and valiant
heroes were found among them in Jazer of Gilead." Jazer was a Levite
city in the tribal domain of Gad, assigned, according to [Jos
21:39](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#039.md), to the Merarites (see on [Ch1
6:81](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#081).md). The number of these Hebronites
was 2700 valiant men ([Ch1 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#032).md). The
additional האבות ראשׁי is obscure, for if we take אבות to be, as it
often is in the genealogies, a contraction for בּית־עבות rof no, the
number given does not suit; for a branch of the Hebronites cannot
possibly have numbered 2700 fathers'-houses (πατριαὶ, groups of related
households): they must be only 2700 men (גּברים), or heads of families,
i.e., households. Not only the large number demands this signification,
but also the comparison of this statement with that in [Ch1
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#030.md). The 1700 חיל בּני of which the
Hebronite branch, Hashabiah with his brethren, consisted, were not so
many πατριαὶ, but only so many men of this πατριά. In the same way, the
Hebronite branch of which Jeriah was head, with his brethren, 2700 חיל
בּני, were also not 2700 πατριαὶ, but only so many men, that is, fathers
of families. It is thus placed beyond doubt that אבות ראשׁי cannot here
denote the heads of fathers'-houses, but only heads of households. And
accordingly we must not understand לאבות ([Ch1
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#031).md) of fathers'-houses, as the lxx
and all commentators do, but only of heads of households. The use of the
verb נדרשׁוּ also favours this view, for this verb is not elsewhere used
of the legal census of the people, i.e., the numbering and entering of
them in the public lists, according to the great families and
fathers'-houses. There may therefore be in נדרשׁוּ a hint that it was
not a genealogical census which was undertaken, but only a numbering of
the heads of households, in order to ascertain the number of scribes and
judges to be appointed. There yet remain in this section three things
which are somewhat strange: 1. Only 1700 scribes and judges were set
over the cis-Jordanic land, inhabited as it was by ten and a half
tribes, while 2700 were set over the trans-Jordanic land with its two
and a half tribes. 2. Both numbers taken together amount to only 4400
men, while David appointed 6000 Levites to be scribes and judges. 3. The
scribes and judges were taken only from two fathers'-houses of the
Kohathites, while most of the other Levitical offices were filled by men
of all the families of the tribe of Levi. On all these grounds, it is
probable that our catalogue of the Levites appointed to be scribes and
judges, i.e., for the external business, is imperfect.
