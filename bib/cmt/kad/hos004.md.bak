II\. The Ungodliness of Israel. Its Punishment, and Final Deliverance -
Hosea 4-14

The spiritual adultery of Israel, with its consequences, which the
prophet has exposed in the first part, and chiefly in a symbolical mode,
is more elaborately detailed here, not only with regard to its true
nature, viz., the religious apostasy and moral depravity which prevailed
throughout the ten tribes, but also in its inevitable consequences,
viz., the destruction of the kingdom and rejection of the people; and
this is done with a repeated side-glance at Judah. To this there is
appended a solemn appeal to return to the Lord, and a promise that the
Lord will have compassion upon the penitent, and renew His covenant of
grace with them.

The Depravity of Israel, and Its Exposure to Punishment - Hosea 4-6:3

The first section, in which the prophet demonstrates the necessity for
judgment, by exposing the sins and follies of Israel, is divided into
two parts by the similar openings, "Hear the word of the Lord" in [Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md), and "Hear ye this" in [Hos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md). The distinction between the two
halves is, that in ch. 4 the reproof of their sins passes from Israel as
a whole, to the sins of the priests in particular; whilst in [Hos
5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md) it passes from the ruin of the
priesthood to the depravity of the whole nation, and announces the
judgment of devastation upon Ephraim, and then closes in [Hos
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md) with a command to return to the
Lord. The contents of the two chapters, however, are so arranged, that
it is difficult to divide them into strophes.

The Sins of Israel and the Visitation of God - Hosea 4

[Hosea 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 4:1</span></span>

[Hos 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md) form the first strophe, and
contain, so to speak, the theme and the sum and substance of the whole
of the following threatening of punishment and judgment. [Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md). "Hear the word of Jehovah, ye
sons of Israel! for Jehovah has a controversy with the inhabitants of
the land; for there is no truth, and no love, and no knowledge of God in
the land." Israel of the ten tribes is here addressed, as [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md) clearly shows. The Lord has a
controversy with it, has to accuse and judge it (cf. [Mic
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002).md), because truth, love, and the
knowledge of God have vanished from the land. 'Emeth and chesed are
frequently associated, not merely as divine attributes, but also as
human virtues. They are used here in the latter sense, as in [Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md). "There is no 'ĕmeth, i.e., no
truthfulness, either in speech or action, no one trusting another any
more" (cf. [Jer 9:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003).md). Chesed is not
human love generally, but love to inferiors, and to those who need help
or compassionate love. Truth and love are mutually conditions, the one
of the other. "Truth cannot be sustained without mercy; and mercy
without truth makes men negligent; so that the one ought to be mingled
with the other" (Jerome). They both have their roots in the knowledge of
God, of which they are the fruit ([Jer
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016.md); [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009).md); for the knowledge of God is not
merely "an acquaintance with His nature and will" (Hitzig), but
knowledge of the love, faithfulness, and compassion of God, resting upon
the experience of the heart. Such knowledge not only produces fear of
God, but also love and truthfulness towards brethren (cf. [Eph
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032.md); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)..md). Where this is wanting,
injustice gains the upper hand.

[Hosea 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 4:2</span></span>

"Swearing, and lying, and murdering, and stealing, and committing
adultery; they break in, and blood reaches to blood." The enumeration of
the prevailing sins and crimes commences with infin. absoll., to set
forth the acts referred to as such with the greater emphasis. 'Alâh, to
swear, in combination with kichēsh, signifies false swearing (= אלוה
שׁוא in [Hos 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md); compare the similar
passage in [Jer 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009).md); but we must not
on that account take kichēsh as subordinate to 'âlâh, or connect them
together, so as to form one idea. Swearing refers to the breach of the
second commandment, stealing to that of the eighth; and the infinitives
which follow enumerate the sins against the fifth, the seventh, and the
sixth commandments. With pârâtsū the address passes into the finite
tense (Luther follows the lxx and Vulg., and connects it with what
precedes; but this is a mistake). The perfects, pârâtsū and nâgâ‛ū, are
not preterites, but express a completed act, reaching from the past into
the present. Pârats to tear, to break, signifies in this instance a
violent breaking in upon others, for the purpose of robbery and murder,
"grassari as פריצים, i.e., as murderers and robbers" (Hitzig), whereby
one bloody deed immediately followed another ([Eze
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#010).md). Dâmı̄m: blood shed with
violence, a bloody deed, a capital crime.

[Hosea 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 4:3</span></span>

These crimes bring the land to ruin. [Hos
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003.md). "Therefore the land mourns, and
every dweller therein, of beasts of the field and birds of the heaven,
wastes away; and even the fishes of the sea perish." These words affirm
not only that the inanimate creation suffers in consequence of the sins
and crimes of men, but that the moral depravity of men causes the
physical destruction of all other creatures. As God has given to man the
dominion over all beasts, and over all the earth, that he may use it for
the glory of God; so does He punish the wickedness of men by
pestilences, or by the devastation of the earth. The mourning of the
earth and the wasting away of the animals are the natural result of the
want of rain and the great drought that ensues, such as was the case in
the time of Ahab throughout the kingdom of the ten tribes ([Kg1
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#018).md), and judging from [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md); [Amo
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008.md), may have occurred repeatedly with
the continued idolatry of the people. The verbs are not futures, in
which case the punishment would be only threatened, but aorists,
expressing what has already happened, and will continue still. כּל־יושׁב
בּהּ (every dweller therein): these are not the men, but the animals, as
the further definition בּחיּה וגו shows. ב is used in the enumeration of
the individuals, as in [Gen 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#021.md); [Gen
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#010.md). The fishes are mentioned last,
and introduced with the emphasizing וגם, to show that the drought would
prevail to such an extent, that even lakes and other waters would be
dried up. האסף, to be collected, to be taken away, to disappear or
perish, as in [Isa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#010.md); [Isa
60:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#020.md); [Jer
48:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#033.md).

[Hosea 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 4:4</span></span>

Notwithstanding the outburst of the divine judgments, the people prove
themselves to be incorrigible in their sins. [Hos
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md). "Only let no man reason, and let
no man punish; yet thy people are like priest-strivers." אך is to be
explained from the tacit antithesis, that with much depravity there
would be much to punish; but this would be useless. The first clause
contains a desperatae nequitiae argumentum. The notion that the second
'ı̄sh is to be taken as an object, is decidedly to be rejected, since it
cannot be defended either from the expression אישׁ בּאישׁ in [Isa
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005.md), or by referring to [Amo
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#015.md), and does not yield any meaning
at all in harmony with the second half of the verse. For there is no
need to prove that it does not mean, "Every one who has a priest blames
the priest instead of himself when any misfortune happens to him," as
Hitzig supposes, since עם signifies the nation, and not an individual.
ועמּך is attached adversatively, giving the reason for the previous
thought in the sense of "since thy people," or simply "thy people are
surely like those who dispute with the priest." The unusual expression,
priest-disputers, equivalent to quarrellers with the priest, an
analogous expression to boundary-movers in [Hos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010.md), may be explained, as Luther, and
Grotius, and others suppose, from the law laid down in [Deu
17:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#012.md), according to which every
law-suit was to be ultimately decided by the priest and judge as the
supreme tribunal, and in which, whoever presumes to resist the verdict
of this tribunal, is threatened with the punishment of death. The
meaning is, that the nation resembled those who are described in the law
as rebels against the priest (Hengstenberg, Dissertations on Pentateuch,
vol. 1. p. 112, translation). The suffix "thy nation" does not refer to
the prophet, but to the sons of Israel, the sum total of whom
constituted their nation, which is directly addressed in the following
verse.

[Hosea 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 4:5</span></span>

"And so wilt thou stumble by day, and the prophet with thee will also
stumble by night, and I will destroy thy mother." Kshal is not used here
with reference to the sin, as Simson supposes, but for the punishment,
and signifies to fall, in the sense of to perish, as in [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md); [Isa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003.md), etc. היּום is not to-day, or in
the day when the punishment shall fall, but "by day," interdiu, on
account of the antithesis לילה, as in [Neh
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016.md). נביא, used without an article in
the most indefinite generality, refers to false prophets - not of Baal,
however, but of Jehovah as worshipped under the image of a calf - who
practised prophesying as a trade, and judging from [Kg1
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#006.md), were very numerous in the
kingdom of Israel. The declaration that the people should fall by day
and the prophets by night, does not warrant our interpreting the day and
night allegorically, the former as the time when the way of right is
visible, and the latter as the time when the way is hidden or obscured;
but according to the parallelism of the clauses, it is to be understood
as signifying that the people and the prophets would fall at all times,
by night and by day. "There would be no time free from the slaughter,
either of individuals in the nation at large, or of false prophets"
(Rosenmller). In the second half of the verse, the destruction of the
whole nation and kingdom is announced ('ēm is the whole nation, as in
[Hos 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002.md); [Heb
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001).md).

[Hosea 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 4:6</span></span>

This thought is carried out still further in the second strophe, [Hos
4:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md). [Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md). "My nation is destroyed for lack
of knowledge; for thou, the knowledge hast thou rejected, and so do I
reject thee from being a priest to me. Thou didst forget the law of thy
God; thy sons will I also forget." The speaker is Jehovah: my nation,
that is to say, the nation of Jehovah. This nation perishes for lack of
the knowledge of God and His salvation. Hadda‛ath (the knowledge) with
the definite article points back to da‛ath Elōhı̄m (knowledge of God) in
[Hos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md). This knowledge Israel might
have drawn from the law, in which God had revealed His counsel and will
([Deu 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015).md), but it would not. It
rejected the knowledge and forgot the law of its God, and would be
rejected and forgotten by God in consequence. In 'attâh (thou) it is not
the priests who are addressed - the custodians of the law and promoters
of divine knowledge in the nation - but the whole nation of the ten
tribes which adhered to the image-worship set up by Jeroboam, with its
illegal priesthood ([Kg1 12:26-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#026).md), in
spite of all the divine threats and judgments, through which one dynasty
after another was destroyed, and would not desist from this sin of
Jeroboam. The Lord would therefore reject it from being priest, i.e.,
would deprive it of the privilege of being a priestly nation ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006).md), would strip it of the privilege
of being a priestly nation ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006).md), would strip it of its priestly
rank, and make it like the heathen. According to Olshausen (Heb. Gram.
p. 179), the anomalous form אמאסאך is only a copyist's error for אמאסך;
but Ewald (247, e) regards it as an Aramaean pausal form. "Thy sons,"
the children of the national community, regarded as a mother, are the
individual members of the nation.

[Hosea 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 4:7</span></span>

"The more they increased, the more they sinned against me; their glory
will I change into shame." כּרבּם, "according to their becoming great,"
does not refer to the increase of the population only ([Hos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011).md), but also to its growing into a
powerful nation, to the increase of its wealth and prosperity, in
consequence of which the population multiplied. The progressive increase
of the greatness of the nation was only attended by increasing sin. As
the nation attributed to its own idols the blessings upon which its
prosperity was founded, and by which it was promoted (cf. [Hos
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#007).md), and looked upon them as the
fruit and reward of its worship, it was strengthened in this delusion by
increasing prosperity, and more and more estranged from the living God.
The Lord would therefore turn the glory of Ephraim, i.e., its greatness
or wealth, into shame. כּבודם is probably chosen on account of its
assonance with כּרבּם. For the fact itself, compare [Hos
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003.md), [Hos
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009.md).

[Hosea 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 4:8</span></span>

"The sin of my people they eat, and after their transgression do they
lift up their soul." The reproof advances from the sin of the whole
nation to the sin of the priesthood. For it is evident that this is
intended, not only from the contents of the present verse, but still
more from the commencement of the next. Chatta'th ‛ammı̄ (the sin of my
people) is the sin-offering of the people, the flesh of which the
priests were commanded to eat, to wipe away the sin of the people (see
[Lev 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#026.md), and the remarks upon this
law at [Lev 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017).md). The fulfilment of
this command, however, became a sin on the part of the priests, from the
fact that they directed their soul, i.e., their longing desire, to the
transgression of the people; in other words, that they wished the sins
of the people to be increased, in order that they might receive a good
supply of sacrificial meat to eat. The prophet evidently uses the word
chattâ'th, which signifies both sin and sin-offering, in a double sense,
and intends to designate the eating of the flesh of the sin-offering as
eating or swallowing the sin of the people. נשׂא נפשׁ אל, to lift up or
direct the soul after anything, i.e., to cherish a longing for it, as in
[Deu 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015.md), etc. The singular suffix
attached to naphshō (his soul) is to be taken distributively: "(they)
every one his soul."

(Note: It is evident from this verse, that the sacrificial worship was
maintained in the kingdom of Israel according to the ritual of the
Mosaic law, and that the Israelitish priests were still in possession of
the rights conferred by the Pentateuch upon Levitical priests.)

[Hosea 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 4:9</span></span>

"Therefore it will happen as to the people so to the priest; and I will
visit his ways upon him, and I repay to him his doing." Since the
priests had abused their office for the purpose of filling their own
bellies, they would perish along with the nation. The suffixes in the
last clauses refer to the priest, although the retribution threatened
would fall upon the people also, since it would happen to the priest as
to the people. This explains the fact that in [Hos
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md) the first clause still applies to
the priest; whereas in the second clause the prophecy once more embraces
the entire nation.

[Hosea 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 4:10</span></span>

"They will eat, and not be satisfied; they commit whoredom, and do not
increase: for they have left off taking heed to Jehovah." The first
clause, which still refers to the priests on account of the evident
retrospect in ואכלוּ to יאכלוּ in [Hos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md), is taken from the threat in [Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md). The following word hiznū, to
practise whoredom (with the meaning of the kal intensified as in [Lev
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018), not to seduce to whoredom.md),
refers to the whole nation, and is to be taken in its literal sense, as
the antithesis לא יפרצוּ requires. Pârats, to spread out, to increase in
number, as in [Exo 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#012.md) and [Gen
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014.md). In the last clause Lשׁמר
belongs to Jehovah: they have given up keeping Jehovah, i.e., giving
heed to Him (cf. [Zac 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#011).md). This
applies to the priests as well as to the people. Therefore God withdraws
His blessing from both, so that those who eat are not satisfied, and
those who commit whoredom do not increase.

[Hosea 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 4:11</span></span>

The allusion to whoredom leads to the description of the idolatrous
conduct of the people in the third strophe, [Hos
4:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md), which is introduced with a
general sentence. [Hos 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md). "Whoring
and wine and new wine take away the heart (the understanding"). Zenūth
is licentiousness in the literal sense of the word, which is always
connected with debauchery. What is true of this, namely, that it weakens
the mental power, shows itself in the folly of idolatry into which the
nation has fallen. [Hos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012.md). "My
nation asks its wood, and its stick prophesies to it: for a spirit of
whoredom has seduced, and they go away whoring from under their God."
שׁאל בּעצו is formed after בּיהוה, to ask for a divine revelation of the
idols made of wood ([Jer 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003.md); [Hab
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#019).md), namely, the teraphim (cf. [Hos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md), and [Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026).md). This reproof is strengthened
by the antithesis my nation, i.e., the nation of Jehovah, the living
God, and its wood, the wood made into idols by the people. The next
clause, "and its stick is showing it," sc. future events (higgı̄d as in
[Isa 41:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022), etc..md), is supposed by
Cyril of Alexandria to refer to the practice of rhabdomancy, which he
calls an invention of the Chaldaeans, and describes as consisting in
this, that two rods were held upright, and then allowed to fall while
forms of incantation were being uttered; and the oracle was inferred
from the way in which they fell, whether forwards or backwards, to the
right or to the left. The course pursued was probably similar to that
connected with the use of the wishing rods.

(Note: According to Herod. iv. 67, this kind of soothsaying was very
common among the Scythians (see at [Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026).md). Another description of
rhabdomancy is described by Abarbanel, according to Maimonides and Moses
Mikkoz: cf. Marck and Rosenmller on this passage.)

The people do this because a spirit of whoredom has besotted them.

By rūăch zenūnı̄m the whoredom is represented as a demoniacal power,
which has seized upon the nation. Zenūnı̄m probably includes both carnal
and spiritual whoredom, since idolatry, especially the Asherah-worship,
was connected with gross licentiousness. The missing object to התעה may
easily be supplied from the context. זנה מתּחת אל, which differs from
זנה מאחרי ([Hos 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002).md), signifies "to
whore away from under God," i.e., so as to withdraw from subjection to
God.

[Hosea 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 4:13</span></span>

This whoredom is still further explained in the next verse. [Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md). "They sacrifice upon the tops of
the mountains, and upon the hills they burn incense, under oak and
poplar and terebinth, for their shadow is good; therefore your daughters
commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery."
Mountain-tops and hills were favourite places for idolatrous worship;
because men thought, that there they were nearer to heaven and to the
deity (see at [Deu 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002).md). From a
comparison of these and other passages, e.g., [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md) and [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md), it is evident that the following
words, "under oak," etc., are not to be understood as signifying that
trees standing by themselves upon mountains and hills were selected as
places for idolatrous worship; but that, in addition to mountains and
hills, green shady trees in the plains and valleys were also chosen for
this purpose. By the enumeration of the oak, the poplar (lı̄bhneh, the
white poplar according to the Sept. in loc. and the Vulg. at [Gen
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#030.md), or the storax-tree, as the lxx
render it at [Gen 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#030).md), and the
terebinth, the frequent expression "under every green tree" ([Deu
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002.md); [Kg1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023.md); [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006).md) is individualized. Such trees
were selected because they gave a good shade, and in the burning lands
of the East a shady place fills the mind with sacred awe. על־כּן,
therefore, on that account, i.e., not because the shadow of the trees
invites to it, but because the places for idolatrous worship erected on
every hand presented an opportunity for it; therefore the daughters and
daughters-in-law carried on prostitution there. The worship of the
Canaanitish and Babylonian goddess of nature was associated with
prostitution, and with the giving up of young girls and women (compare
Movers, Phnizier, i. pp. 583, 595ff.).

[Hosea 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 4:14</span></span>

"I will not visit it upon your daughters that they commit whoredom, nor
upon your daughters-in-law that they commit adultery; for they
themselves go aside with harlots, and with holy maidens do they
sacrifice: and the nation that does not see is ruined." God would not
punish the daughters and daughters-in-law for their whoredom, because
the elder ones did still worse. "So great was the number of
fornications, that all punishment ceased, in despair of any amendment"
(Jerome). With כּי הם God turns away from the reckless nation, as
unworthy of being further addressed or exhorted, in righteous
indignation at such presumptuous sinning, and proceed to speak about it
in the third person: for "they (the fathers and husbands, not 'the
priest,' as Simson supposes, since there is no allusion to them here)
go," etc. פּרד, piel in an intransitive sense, to separate one's self,
to go aside for the purpose of being alone with the harlots. Sacrificing
with the qedēshōth, i.e., with prostitutes, or Hetairai (see at [Gen
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014).md), may have taken its rise in the
prevailing custom, viz., that fathers of families came with their wives
to offer yearly sacrifices, and the wives shared in the sacrificial
meals ([Sa1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003)..md). Coming to the altar
with Hetairai instead of their own wives, was the climax of shameless
licentiousness. A nation that had sunk so low and had lost all
perception must perish. לבט = Arab. lbṭ: to throw to the earth; or in
the niphal, to cast headlong into destruction ([Pro
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008.md), [Pro
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 4:15</span></span>

A different turn is now given to the prophecy, viz., that if Israel
would not desist from idolatry, Judah ought to beware of participating
in the guilt of Israel; and with this the fourth strophe ([Hos
4:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md) is introduced, containing the
announcement of the inevitable destruction of the kingdom of the ten
tribes. [Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md). "If thou commit
whoredom, O Israel, let not Judah offend! Come ye not to Gilgal, go not
up to Bethaven, and swear ye not by the life of Jehovah." אשׁם, to
render one's self guilty by participating in the whoredom, i.e., the
idolatry, of Israel. This was done by making pilgrimages to the places
of idolatrous worship in that kingdom, viz., to Gilgal, i.e., not the
Gilgal in the valley of the Jordan, but the northern Gilgal upon the
mountains, which has been preserved in the village of Jiljilia to the
south-west of Silo (Seilun; see at [Deu
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#030.md) and [Jos
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#035).md). In the time of Elijah and
Elisha it was the seat of a school of the prophets ([Kg2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001.md); [Kg2
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038).md); but it was afterwards chosen as
the seat of one form of idolatrous worship, the origin and nature of
which are unknown (compare [Hos 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md);
[Hos 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md); [Amo
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md); [Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005).md). Bethaven is not the place of
that name mentioned in [Jos 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md), which
was situated to the south-east of Bethel; but, as [Amo
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md) and [Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md) clearly show, a name which Hosea
adopted from [Amo 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md) for Bethel (the
present Beitin), to show that Bethel, the house of God, had become
Bethaven, a house of idols, through the setting up of the golden calf
there ([Kg1 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029).md). Swearing by the
name of Jehovah was commanded in the law ([Deu
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md); [Deu
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020.md); compare [Jer
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002).md); but this oath was to have its
roots in the fear of Jehovah, to be simply an emanation of His worship.
The worshippers of idols, therefore, were not to take it into their
mouths. The command not to swear by the life of Jehovah is connected
with the previous warnings. Going to Gilgal to worship idols, and
swearing by Jehovah, cannot go together. The confession of Jehovah in
the mouth of an idolater is hypocrisy, pretended piety, which is more
dangerous than open ungodliness, because it lulls the conscience to
sleep.

[Hosea 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 4:16</span></span>

The reason for this warning is given in [Hos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md)., viz., the punishment which will
fall upon Israel. [Hos 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md). "For
Israel has become refractory like a refractory cow; now will Jehovah
feed them like a lamb in a wide field." סורר, unmanageable, refractory
([Deu 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018.md), cf. [Zac
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011).md). As Israel would not submit to
the yoke of the divine law, it should have what it desired. God would
feed it like a lamb, which being in a wide field becomes the prey of
wolves and wild beasts, i.e., He would give it up to the freedom of
banishment and dispersion among the nations.

[Hosea 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hos 4:17</span></span>

"Ephraim is joined to idols, let it alone." חבוּר עצבּים, bound up with
idols, so that it cannot give them up. Ephraim, the most powerful of the
ten tribes, is frequently used in the loftier style of the prophets for
Israel of the ten tribes. הנּח־לו, as in [Sa2
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#011.md); [Kg2
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#018.md), let him do as he likes, or
remain as he is. Every attempt to bring the nation away from its
idolatry is vain. The expression hannach-lō does not necessitate the
assumption, however, that these words of Jehovah are addressed to the
prophets. They are taken from the language of ordinary life, and simply
mean: it may continue in its idolatry, the punishment will not long be
delayed.

[Hosea 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hos 4:18</span></span>

"Their drinking has degenerated; whoring they have committed whoredom;
their shields have loved, loved shame. [Hos
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#019.md). The wind has wrapt it up in its
wings, so that they are put to shame because of their sacrifices." סר
from סוּר, to fall off, degenerate, as in [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md). סבא is probably strong,
intoxicating wine (cf. [Isa 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022.md); [Nah
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010).md); here it signifies the effect of
this wine, viz., intoxication. Others take sâr in the usual sense of
departing, after [Sa1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#014.md), and
understand the sentence conditionally: "when their intoxication is gone,
they commit whoredom." But Hitzig has very properly object to this, that
it is intoxication which leads to licentiousness, and not temperance.
Moreover, the strengthening of hisnū by the inf. abs. is not in harmony
with this explanation. The hiphil hiznâh is used in an emphatic sense,
as in [Hos 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md). The meaning of the
last half of the verse is also a disputed point, more especially on
account of the word הבוּ, which only occurs here, and which can only be
the imperative of יהב (הבוּ for הבוּ), or a contraction of אהבוּ. All
other explanations are arbitrary. But we are precluded from taking the
word as an imperative by קלון, which altogether confuses the sense, if
we adopt the rendering "their shields love 'Give ye' - shame." We
therefore prefer taking הבוּ as a contraction of אהבוּ, and אהבוּ הבוּ
as a construction resembling the pealal form, in which the latter part
of the fully formed verb is repeated, with the verbal person as an
independent form (Ewald, 120), viz., "their shields loved, loved shame,"
which yields a perfectly suitable thought. The princes are figuratively
represented as shields, as in Ps. 47:10, as the supporters and
protectors of the state. They love shame, inasmuch as they love the sin
which brings shame. This shame will inevitably burst upon the kingdom.
The tempest has already seized upon the people, or wrapt them up with
its wings (cf. [Psa 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md); [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003).md), and will carry them away ([Isa
57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013).md). צרר, literally to bind
together, hence to lay hold of, wrap up. Rūăch, the wind, or tempest, is
a figurative term denoting destruction, like רוּח קדים in [Hos
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015.md) and [Eze
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#003.md). אותהּ refers to Ephraim
represented as a woman, like the suffix attached to מגנּיה in [Hos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md). יבשׁוּ מזּבחותם, to be put to
shame on account of their sacrifices, i.e., to be deceived in their
confidence in their idols (bōsh with min as in [Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006.md); [Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036.md); [Jer
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#013), etc..md), or to discover that the
sacrifices which they offered to Jehovah, whilst their heart was
attached to the idols, did not save from ruin. The plural formation
זבחות for זבחים only occurs here, but it has many analogies in its
favour, and does not warrant our altering the reading into מזבּחותם,
after the Sept. ἐκ τῶν θυσιατηρίων, as Hitzig proposes; whilst the
inadmissibility of this proposal is sufficiently demonstrated by the
fact that there is nothing to justify the omission of the indispensable
מן, and the cases which Hitzig cites as instances in which min is
omitted (viz., [Zac 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md); [Psa
68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014.md), and [Deu
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#011).md) are based upon a false
interpretation.
