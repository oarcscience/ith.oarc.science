### [Ezekiel Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 13:0</span></span>

Against the False Prophets and Prophetesses

The way was already prepared for the address in this chapter by the
announcement in [Eze 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#024.md). It divides
itself into two parts, viz., vv. 1-16, directed against the false
prophets; and [Eze 13:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md), against
the false prophetesses. In both parts their conduct is first described,
and then the punishment foretold. Jeremiah, like Ezekiel, and sometimes
still more strongly, denounces the conduct of the false prophets, who
are therefore to be sought for not merely among the exiles, but
principally among those who were left behind in the land (vid., [Jer
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009)..md). A lively intercourse was kept
up between the two, so that the false prophets extended their operations
from Canaan to the Chaboras, and vice versa.

[Ezekiel 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 13:1</span></span>

Against the False Prophets

Their conduct. - [Eze 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001.md). And the
word of Jehovah came to me, saying, [Eze
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#002.md). Son of man, prophesy against the
prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to the prophets out of their
heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah. [Eze
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#003.md). Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe
upon the foolish prophets, who go after their spirit, and that which
they have not seen! [Eze 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#004.md). Like
foxes in ruins have thy prophets become, O Israel. [Eze
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005.md). Ye do not stand before the
breaches, nor wall up the wall around the house of Israel to stand firm
in the battle on the day of Jehovah. [Eze
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#006.md). They see vanity and lying
soothsaying, who say, "Oracle of Jehovah;" and Jehovah hath not sent
them; so that they might hope for the fulfilment of the word. [Eze
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#007.md). Do ye not see vain visions, and
speak lying soothsaying, and say, Oracle of Jehovah; and I have not
spoken? - The addition הנּבּאים, "who prophesy," is not superfluous.
Ezekiel is not to direct his words against the prophets as a body, but
against those who follow the vocation of prophet in Israel without being
called to it by God on receiving a divine revelation, but simply
prophesying out of their own heart, or according to their own subjective
imagination. In the name of the Lord he is to threaten them with woes,
as fools who follow their own spirit; in connection with which we must
bear in mind that folly, according to the Hebrew idea, was not merely a
moral failing, but actual godlessness (cf. [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001).md). The phrase "going after their
spirit" is interpreted and rendered more emphatic by לבלתּי, which is to
be taken as a relative clause, "that which they have not seen," i.e.,
whose prophesying does not rest upon intuition inspired by God.
Consequently they cannot promote the welfare of the nation, but ([Eze
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#004).md) are like foxes in ruins or
desolate places. The point of comparison is to be found in the
undermining of the ground by foxes, qui per cuniculos subjectam terram
excavant et suffodiunt (Bochart). For the thought it not exhausted by
the circumstance that they withdraw to their holes instead of standing
in front of the breach (Hitzig); and there is no force in the objection
that, with this explanation, בּחרבות is passed over and becomes in fact
tautological (Hvernick). The expression "in ruins" points to the fall of
the theocracy, which the false prophets cannot prevent, but, on the
contrary, accelerate by undermining the moral foundations of the state.
For ([Eze 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005).md) they do not stand in
the breaches, and do not build up the wall around the house of Israel
(לא belongs to both clauses). He who desires to keep off the enemy, and
prevent his entering the fortress, will stand in the breach. For the
same purpose are gaps and breaches in the fortifications carefully built
up. The sins of the people had made gaps and breaches in the walls of
Jerusalem; in other words, had caused the moral decay of the city. But
they had not stood in the way of this decay and its causes, as the
calling and duty of prophets demanded, by reproving the sins of the
people, that they might rescue the people and kingdom from destruction
by restoring its moral and religious life. לעמד בּמּלחמה, to stand, or
keep ground, i.e., so that ye might have kept your ground in the war.
The subject is the false prophets, not Israel, as Hvernick supposes. "In
the day of Jehovah," i.e., in the judgment which Jehovah has decreed.
Not to stand, does not mean merely to avert the threatening judgment,
but not to survive the judgment itself, to be overthrown by it. This
arises from the fact that their prophesying is a life; because Jehovah,
whose name they have in their mouths, has not sent them ([Eze
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#006).md). ויחלוּ is dependent upon שׁלחם:
God has not sent them, so that they could hope for the fulfilment of the
word which they speak.The rendering adopted by others, "and they cause
to hope," is untenable; for יחל with ל does not mean "to cause to hope,"
or give hope, but simply to hope for anything. This was really the case;
and it is affirmed in the declaration, which is repeated in the form of
a direct appeal in [Eze 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#007.md), to the
effect that their visions were vain and lying soothsaying. For this they
are threatened with the judgment described in the verses which follow.

[Ezekiel 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 13:8</span></span>

Punishment of the False Prophets

[Eze 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#008.md). Therefore thus saith the
Lord Jehovah, Because ye speak vanity and prophesy lying, therefore,
behold, I will deal with you, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. [Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009.md). And my hand shall be against the
prophets who see vanity and divine lies: in the council of my people
they shall not be, and in the register of the house of Israel they shall
not be registered, and into the land of Israel shall they not come; and
ye shall learn that I am the Lord Jehovah. [Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010.md). Because, yea because they lead
my people astray, and say, "Peace," though there is no peace; and when
it (my people) build a wall, behold, they plaster it with cement: [Eze
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#011.md). Say to the plasterers, that it
will fall: there cometh a pouring rain; and ye hailstones fall, and thou
stormy wind break loose! [Eze 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#012.md).
And, behold, the wall falleth; will men not say to you, Where is the
plaster with which ye have plastered it? [Eze
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#013.md). Therefore thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, I cause a stormy wind to break forth in my wrath, and a pouring
rain will come in my anger, and hailstones in wrath, for destruction.
[Eze 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#014.md). And I demolish the wall
which ye have plastered, and cast it to the ground, that its foundation
may be exposed, and it shall fall, and ye shall perish in the midst of
it; and shall learn that I am Jehovah. [Eze
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#015.md). And I will exhaust my wrath
upon the wall, and upon those who plaster it; and will say to you, It is
all over with the wall, and all over with those who plastered it; [Eze
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#016.md). With the prophets of Israel who
prophesied to Jerusalem, and saw visions of peace for her, though there
is no peace, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - In [Eze
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#008.md) the punishment which is to fall
upon the false prophets is threatened in general terms; and in [Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009.md) it is more specifically described
in the form of a climax, rising higher and higher in the severity of its
announcements. (1) They are no longer to form part of the council of the
people of God; that is to say, they will lose their influential position
among the people. (סוד is the sphere of counsellors, not the social
sphere.) (2) Their names shall not be registered in the book of the
house of Israel. The book of the house of Israel is the register in
which the citizens of the kingdom of God are entered. Any one whose name
was not admitted into this book, or was struck out of it, was separated
thereby from the citizenship of Israel, and lost all the privileges
which citizenship conferred. The figure of the book of life is a similar
one (cf. [Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032).md). For Israel is
not referred to here with regard to its outward nationality, but as the
people of God; so that exclusion from Israel was also exclusion from
fellowship with God. The circumstance that it is not the erasure of
their names from the book that is mentioned here, but their not being
entered in the book at all, may be accounted for from the reference
contained in the words to the founding of the new kingdom of God. The
old theocracy was abolished, although Jerusalem was not yet destroyed.
The covenant nation had fallen under the judgment; but out of that
portion of Israel which was dispersed among the heathen, a remnant would
be gathered together again, and having been brought back to its own
land, would be made anew into a holy people of God (cf. [Eze
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#017)..md). But the false prophets are
not to be received into the citizenship of the new kingdom. (3) They are
not even to come into the land of Israel; i.e., they are not merely to
remain in exile, but to lose all share in the privileges and blessings
of the kingdom of God. This judgment will come upon them because they
lead astray the people of God, by proclaiming peace where there is no
peace; i.e., by raising and cherishing false hopes of prosperity and
peace, by which they encourage the people in their sinful lives, and
lead them to imagine that all is well, and there is no judgment to be
feared (cf. [Jer 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017.md) and [Mic
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005).md). The exposure of this offence is
introduced by the solemn יען וּביען, because and because (cf. [Lev
26:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#043).md); and the offence itself is
exhibited by means of a figure.

When the people build a wall, the false prophets plaster the wall with
lime. והוּא ([Eze 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010).md) refers to
עמּי, and the clause is a circumstantial one. תּפל signifies the plaster
coating or cement of a wall, probably from the primary meaning of תּפל,
to stick or plaster over (= טפל, conglutinare, to glue, or fasten
together), from which the secondary meaning of weak, insipid, has
sprung. The proper word for plaster or cement is טיח ([Eze
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#012).md), and תּפל is probably chosen
with an allusion to the tropical signification of that which is silly or
absurd ([Jer 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013.md); [Lam
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014).md). The meaning of the figure is
intelligible enough. The people build up foolish hopes, and the prophets
not only paint these hopes for them in splendid colours, but even
predict their fulfilment, instead of denouncing their folly, pointing
out to the people the perversity of their ways, and showing them that
such sinful conduct must inevitably be followed by punishment and ruin.
The plastering is therefore a figurative description of deceitful
flattery or hypocrisy, i.e., the covering up of inward corruption by
means of outward appearance (as in [Mat
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027.md) and [Act
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003).md). This figure leads the prophet
to describe the judgment which they are bringing upon the nation and
themselves, as a tempest accompanied with hail and pouring rain, which
throws down the wall that has been erected and plastered over; and in
connection with this figure he opens out this double thought: (1) the
conduct of the people, which is encouraged by the false prophets, cannot
last ([Eze 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#011.md) and [Eze
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#012)); and (2.md) when this work of
theirs is overthrown, the false prophets themselves will also meet with
the fate they deserve ([Eze 13:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#013).md).
The threat of judgment commences with the short, energetic ויפּל, let it
(the wall) fall, or it shall fall, with Vav to indicate the train of
thought (Ewald, 347a). The subject is תּפל, to which יפּל suggests a
resemblance in sound. In [Eze 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#012.md)
this is predicted as the fate awaiting the plastered wall. In the
description of the bursting storm the account passes with ואתּנה (and
ye) into a direct address; in other words, the description assumes the
form of an appeal to the destructive forces of nature to burst forth
with all their violence against the work plastered over by the prophets,
and to destroy it. גּשׁם שׁוטף ., pouring rain; cf. [Eze
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022.md). אבני אלגּבישׁ here and [Eze
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022.md) are hailstones. The word
אלגּבישׁ, which is peculiar to Ezekiel, is probably גּבישׁ ([Job
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#018).md), with the Arabic article אל;
ice, then crystal. רוּח , wind of storms, a hurricane or tempest. תּבקּע
([Eze 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#011).md) is used intransitively,
to break loose; but in [Eze 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#013.md) it
is transitive, to cause to break loose. The active rendering adopted by
Kliefoth, "the storm will rend," sc. the plaster of the wall, is
inappropriate in [Eze 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#011.md); for a
tempest does not rend either the plaster or the wall, but throws the
wall down. The translation which Kliefoth gives in [Eze
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#013.md), "I will rend by tempest," is at
variance with both the language and the sense. Jehovah will cause this
tempest to burst forth in His wrath and destroy the wall, and lay it
level with the ground. The suffix in בּתוכהּ refers (ad sensum) to
Jerusalem not to קיר (the wall), which is masculine, and has no תּוך
(midst). The words pass from the figure to the reality here; for the
plastered wall is a symbol of Jerusalem, as the centre of the theocracy,
which is to be destroyed, and to bury the lying prophets in its ruins.
וכלּיתי ([Eze 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#015).md) contains a play
upon the word לכלה in [Eze 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#013.md). By a
new turn given to klh כלה, Ezekiel repeats the thought that the wrath of
God is to destroy the wall and its plasterers; and through this
repetition he rounds off the threat with the express declaration, that
the false prophets who are ever preaching peace are the plasterers to
whom he refers.

[Ezekiel 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 13:17</span></span>

Against the False Prophetesses

As the Lord had not endowed men only with the gifts of prophecy, but
sometimes women also, e.g., Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah; so women also
rose up along with the false prophets, and prophesied out of their own
hearts without being impelled by the Spirit of God. [Eze
13:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md). Their conduct. - [Eze
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md). And thou, son of man, direct
thy face towards the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their
heart and prophesy against them, [Eze
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018.md). And say, Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Woe to those who sew coverings together over all the joints of
my hands, and make caps for the head of every size, to catch souls! Ye
catch the souls of my people, and keep your souls alive. [Eze
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019.md). And ye profane me with my
people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay souls
which should not die, and to keep alive which should not live, by your
lying to my people who hearken to lying. - Like the prophets in [Eze
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#002.md), the prophetesses are here
described as prophesying out of their own heart ([Eze
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017).md); and in [Eze
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018.md) and [Eze
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019.md) their offences are more
particularly described. The meaning of these verses is entirely
dependent upon the view to be taken of ידי, which the majority of
expositors, following the lead of the lxx, the Syriac, and the Vulgate,
have regarded as identical with ידים or יד, and understood as referring
to the hands of the women or prophetesses. But there is nothing to
justify the assumption that ידי is an unusual form for ידים, which even
Ewald takes it to be (Lehrbuch, 177a). Still less can it stand for the
singular יד. And we have not sufficient ground for altering the text, as
the expression זרועתיכם in [Eze 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020.md)
(I will tear the כּסתות from your arms) does not require the assumption
that the prophetesses had hidden their arms in כסתות; and such a
supposition is by no means obviously in harmony with the facts.

The word כּסתות, from כּסת, with ת fem. treated as a radical letter (cf.
Ewald, 186e), means a covering or concealment = כּסוּת. The meaning
"cushion" or "pillow" (lxx προσκεφάλαια, Vulg. pulvilli) is merely an
inference drawn from this passage, and is decidedly erroneous; for the
word תּפר (to sew together) is inapplicable to cushions, as well as the
phrase על כּל־אצּילי ידי, inasmuch as cushions are not placed upon the
joints of the hands, and still less are they sewed together upon them.
The latter is also a decisive reason for rejecting the explanation given
by Hvernick, namely, that the kesâthōth were carpets, which were used as
couches, and upon which these voluptuous women are represented as
reclining. For cushions or couches are not placed upon, but under, the
arm-joints (or elbows) and the shoulders, which Hvernick understands by
אצּילי יד. This also overthrows another explanation given of the words,
namely, that they refer to carpets, which the prophetesses had sewed
together for all their arm-joints, so as to form comfortable beds upon
splendid carpets, that they may indulge in licentiousness thereon. The
explanation given by Ephraem Syrus, and adopted by Hitzig, namely, that
the kesâthōth were amulets or straps, which they would round their
arm-joints when they received or delivered their oracles, is equally
untenable. For, as Kliefoth has observed, "it is evident that there is
not a word in the text about adultery, or amulets, or straps used in
prayer." And again, when we proceed to the next clause, the traditional
rendering of מספּחות, as signifying either pillows (ὑπαυχένια, Symm.;
cervicalia, Vulg.) or broad cloaks = מטפּחות (Hitzig, Hvernick, etc.),
is neither supported by the usage of the language, nor in harmony with
על ראשׁ. Mispâchōth, from sâphach, to join, cannot have any other
meaning in the present context than a cap fitting close to the head; and
על must denote the pattern which was followed, as in [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md); [Est
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#026.md) : they make the caps after
(answering to) the head of every stature. The words of both clauses are
figurative, and have been correctly explained by Kliefoth as follows: "A
double charge is brought against the prophetesses. In the first place,
they sew coverings together to wrap round all the joints of the hand of
God, so that He cannot touch them; i.e., they cover up and conceal the
word of God by their prophesying, more especially its rebuking and
threatening force, so that the threatening and judicial arm of God,
which ought above all to become both manifest and effective through His
prophetic word, does not become either one or the other. In the second
place, they make coverings upon the heads of men, and construct them in
such a form that they exactly fit the stature or size or every
individual, so that the men neither hear nor see; i.e., by means of
their flattering lies, which adapt themselves to the subjective
inclinations of their hearers at the time, they cover up the senses of
the men, so that they retain neither ear nor eye for the truth." They do
both of these to catch souls. The inevitable consequence of their act is
represented as having been intended by them; and this intention is then
still further defined as being to catch the souls of the people of God;
i.e., to allure them to destruction, and take care of their own souls.
The clause הנּפשׁות תּצודדנה is not to be taken as a question, "Will ye
catch the souls?" implying a doubt whether they really thought that they
could carry on such conduct as theirs with perfect impunity (Hvernick).
It contains a simple statement of what really took place in their
catching of souls, namely, "they catch the souls of the people of God,
and preserve their own souls;" i.e., they rob the people of God of their
lives, and take care of their own (Kliefoth). לעמּי is used instead of
the genitive (stat. constr.) to show that the accent rests upon עמּי.
And in the same way we have לכנה instead of the suffix. The construction
is the same as in [Sa1 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#016.md). [Eze
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019.md) shows how great their sin had
been. They profane God among His people; namely, by delivering the
suggestions of their own heart to the people as divine revelations, for
the purpose of getting their daily bread thereby (cf. [Mic
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005).md); by hurling into destruction,
through their lies, those who are only too glad to listen to lying; by
slaying the souls of the people which ought to live, and by preserving
those which ought not to live, i.e., their own souls ([Deu
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#020).md). The punishment for this will
not fail to come.

[Ezekiel 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 13:20</span></span>

Punishment of the False Prophetesses

[Eze 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020.md). Therefore thus saith the
Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will deal with your coverings with which ye
catch, I will let the souls fly; and I will tear them away from your
arms, and set the souls free, which ye catch, the souls to fly. [Eze
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#021.md). And I will tear your caps in
pieces, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no more
become a prey in your hands; and ye shall learn that I am Jehovah. [Eze
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022.md). Because ye grieve the heart of
the righteous with lying, when I have not pained him; and strengthen the
hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his evil way, to
preserve his life. [Eze 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#023.md).
Therefore ye shall no more see vanity, and no longer practise
soothsaying: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall
learn that I am Jehovah. - The threat of judgment is closely connected
with the reproof of their sins. [Eze
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020.md) and [Eze
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#021.md) correspond to the reproof in
[Eze 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018.md), and [Eze
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022.md) and [Eze
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#023.md) to that in [Eze
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019.md). In the first place, the Lord
will tear in pieces the coverings and caps, i.e., the tissue of lies
woven by the false prophetesses, and rescue the people from their snares
([Eze 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020.md) and [Eze
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#021).md); and, secondly, He will
entirely put an end to the pernicious conduct of the persons addressed
([Eze 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022.md) and [Eze
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#023).md). The words from אשׁר אתּנּה to
לפרחות ([Eze 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020).md), when taken as one
clause, as they generally are, offer insuperable difficulties, since it
is impossible to get any satisfactory meaning from שׁם, and לפרחות will
not fit in. Whether we understand by kesâthōth coverings or cushions,
the connection of שׁם with אשׁר (where ye catch the souls), which the
majority of commentators prefer, is untenable; for coverings and
cushions were not the places where the souls were caught, but could only
be the means employed for catching them. Instead of שׁם we should expect
בּם or בּהם; and Hitzig proposes to amend it in this way. Still less
admissible is the proposal to take שׁם as referring to Jerusalem
("wherewith ye catch souls there"); as שׁם would not only contain a
perfectly superfluous definition of locality, but would introduce a
limitation altogether at variance with the context. It is not affirmed
either of the prophets or of the prophetesses that they lived and
prophesied in Jerusalem alone. In [Eze
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#002.md) and [Eze
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md) reference is made in the most
general terms to the prophets of Israel and the daughters of thy people;
and in [Eze 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#016.md) it is simply stated
that the false prophets prophesied peace to Jerusalem when there was no
peace at all. Consequently we must regard the attempt to find in שׁם an
allusion to Jerusalem (cf. [Eze 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#016).md)
as a mere loophole, which betrays an utter inability to get any
satisfactory sense for the word. Moreover, if we construe the words in
this manner, לפרחות is also incomprehensible. Commentators have for the
most part admitted that פּרח taht is used here in the Aramaean sense of
volare, to fly. In the second half of the verse there is no doubt about
its having this meaning. For שׁלּח is used in [Deu
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#007.md) for liberating a bird, or letting
it fly; and the combination שׁלּח is supported by the expression שׁלּח
לחפשׁי in [Exo 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#026.md), while the
comparison of souls to birds is sustained by [Psa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md) and [Psa
124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md). Hence the true meaning of the
whole passage לפרחות... שׁלּחתּי את־הנּפשׁות is, I send away (set free)
the souls, which ye have caught, as flying ones, i.e., so that they
shall be able to fly away at liberty. And in the first half also we must
not adopt a different rendering for לפרחות, since את־הנּפשׁות is also
connected with it there.

But if the words in question are combined into one clause in the first
hemistich, they will give us a sense which is obviously wrong, viz.,
"wherewith ye catch the souls to let them fly." As the impossibility of
adopting this rendering has been clearly seen, the attempt has been made
to cloak over the difficulty by means of paraphrases. Ewald, for
example, renders לפרחות in both cases "as if they were birds of
passage;" but in the first instance he applies it to birds of passage,
for which nets are spread for the purpose of catching them; and in the
second, to birds of passage which are set at liberty. Thus, strictly
speaking, he understands the first לפרחות as signifying the catching of
birds; and the second, letting them fly: an explanation which refutes
itself, as pârach, to fly, cannot mean "to catch" as well. The rendering
adopted by Kimchi, Rosenmller, and others, who translate לפרחות ut
advolent ad vos in the first hemistich, and ut avolent in the second, is
no better. And the difficulty is not removed by resorting to the
dialects, as Hvernick, for the purpose of forcing upon פּרחות the
meaning dissoluteness of licentiousness, for which there is no authority
in the Hebrew language itself. If, therefore, it is impossible to obtain
any satisfactory meaning from the existing text, it cannot be correct;
and no other course is open to us than to alter the unsuitable שׁם into
שׂם, and divide the words from אשׁר אתּנּה to לפרחות into two clauses,
as we have done in our translation above. There is no necessity to
supply anything to the relative אשׁר, as צוּד is construed with a double
accusative (e.g., [Mic 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002.md), צוּד חרם,
to catch with a net), and the object to מצדדות, viz., the souls, can
easily be supplied from the next clause. שׂם, as a participle, can
either be connected with הנני, "behold, I make," or taken as introducing
an explanatory clause: "making the souls into flying ones," i.e., so
that they are able to fly (שׁוּם ל, [Gen
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002), etc..md). The two clauses of the
first hemistich would then exactly correspond to the two clauses of the
second half of the verse. וקרעתּי אתם is explanatory of הנני אל כסת, I
will tear off the coverings from their arms. These words do not require
the assumption that the prophetesses wore the לסתות on their arms, but
may be fully explained from the supposition that the persons in question
prepared them with their own hands. 'ושׁלּחתּי וגו corresponds to 'שׂם
את־הנּפשׁות וגו; and לפרחות is governed by שׁלּחתּי. The insertion of
את־הנּפשׁים is to be accounted for from the copious nature of Ezekiel's
style; at the same time, it is not merely a repetition of את־הנּפשׁות,
which is separated from לפרחות by the relative clause 'אשׁר אתּם מח, but
as the unusual plural form נפשׁים shows, is intended as a practical
explanation of the fact, that the souls, while compared to birds, are
regarded as living beings, which is the meaning borne by נפשׁ in other
passages. The omission of the article after את may be explained,
however, from the fact that the souls had been more precisely defined
just before; just as, for example, in [Sa1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#006.md); [Sa2
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018.md), where the more precise
definition follows immediately afterwards (cf. Ewald, 277a, p. 683). -
The same thing is said in [Eze 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#021.md),
with regard to the caps, as has already been said of the coverings in
[Eze 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020.md). God will tear these in
pieces also, to deliver His people from the power of the lying
prophetesses. In what way God will do this is explained in [Eze
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022.md) and [Eze
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#023.md), namely, not only by putting
their lying prophecies to shame through His judgment, but by putting an
end to soothsaying altogether, and exterminating the false prophetesses
by making them an object of ridicule and shame. The reason for this
threat is given in [Eze 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022.md), where a
further description is given of the disgraceful conduct of these
persons; and here the disgracefulness of their conduct is exhibited in
literal terms and without any figure. They do harm to the righteous and
good, and strengthen the hands of the wicked. הכאות, Hiphil of כּאה, in
Syriac, to use harshly or depress; so here in the Hiphil, connected with
לב, to afflict the heart. שׁקר is used adverbially: with lying, or in a
lying manner; namely, by predicting misfortune and divine punishments,
with which they threatened the godly, who would not acquiesce in their
conduct; whereas, on the contrary, they predicted prosperity and peace
to the ungodly, who were willing to be ensnared by them, and thus
strengthened them in their evil ways. For this God would put them to
shame through His judgments, which would make their deceptions manifest,
and their soothsaying loathsome.
