### [Job Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#001.md)

[Job 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 18:1</span></span>

1 Then began Bildad the Shuhite, and said:

2 How long will ye hunt for words?!

Attend, and afterwards we will speak.

3 Wherefore are we accounted as beasts,

And narrow-minded in your eyes?

Job's speeches are long, and certainly are a trial of patience to the
three, and the heaviest trial to Bildad, whose turn now comes on,
because he is at pains throughout to be brief. Hence the reproach of
endless babbling with which he begins here, as at [Job
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002.md), when he at last has an
opportunity of speaking; in connection with which it must, however, not
be forgotten that Job also, [Job 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#003.md),
satirically calls upon them to cease. He is indeed more entitled than
his opponents to the entreaty not to weary him with long speeches. The
question, [Job 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#002.md), if קנצי six
derived from קץ, furnishes no sense, unless perhaps it is, with Ralbag,
explained: how long do you make close upon close in order, when you seem
to have come to an end, to begin continually anew? For to give the
thought: how long do you make no end of speaking, it must have been לא
עד־אנה, as the lxx (μέχρι τίνος ου ̓ παύσῃ:) involuntarily inserts the
negative. And what should the plur. mean by this rendering? The form
קנצי = קצּי would not cause doubt; for though קצּים does not occur
elsewhere in the Old Testament, it is nevertheless sufficient that it is
good Aramaic (קצּין), and that another Hebr. plural, as קצי, קצוי,
קצוות, would have been hardly in accordance with the usage of the
language. But the plural would not be suitable here generally, the
over-delicate explanation of Ralbag perhaps excepted. Since the book of
Job abounds in Arabisms, and in Arabic qanaṣa (as synon. of ṣâd)
signifies venari, venando capere, and qanṣun (maqnaṣun) cassis, rete
venatorium; since, further, שׂים קנצים (comp. שׂים ארב, [Jer
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007).md) is an incontrovertible reading,
and all the difficulties in connection with the reference to קץ lying in
the עד־אנה for עד־אנה לא and in the plur. vanish, we translate with
Castell., Schultens, J. D. Mich., and most modern expositors: how long
(here not different from [Job 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002.md);
[Job 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#002).md) will ye lay snares
(construction, as also by the other rendering, like [Job
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005.md); [Job
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016), according to Ges. 116, 1.md) for
words; which, however, is not equivalent to hunt for words in order to
contradict, but in order to talk on continually.

(Note: In post-bibl. Hebrew, קנצים has become common in the
signification, proofs, arguments, as e.g., a Karaitic poet says, ויחוד
שׁמך בקנצים הקימותי, the oneness of thy name have I upheld with proofs;
vid., Pinsker, Likute Kadmoniot. Zur Gesch. des Karaismus und der
karischen Literatur, 1860, S. קסו.)

Job is the person addressed, for Bildad agrees with the two others. It
is remarkable, however, that he addresses Job with "you." Some say that
he thinks of Job as one of a number; Ewald observes that the controversy
becomes more wide and general; and Schlottm. conjectures that Bildad
fixes his eye on individuals of his hearers, on whose countenances he
believed he saw a certain inclination to side with Job. This conjecture
we will leave to itself; but the remark which Schlottm. also makes, that
Bildad regards Job as a type of a whole class, is correct, only one must
also add, this address in the plur. is a reply to Job's sarcasm by a
similar one. As Job has told the friends that they act as if they were
mankind in general, and all wisdom were concentrated in them, so Bildad
has taken it amiss that Job connects himself with the whole of the truly
upright, righteous, and pure; and he addresses him in the plural,
because he, the unit, has puffed himself up as such a collective whole.
This wrangler - he means - with such a train behind him, cannot
accomplish anything: Oh that you would understand (הבין, as e.g., [Job
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003.md), not causative, as [Job
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#024).md), i.e., come to your senses, and
afterward we will speak, i.e., it is only then possible to walk in the
way of understanding. That is not now possible, when he, as one who
plays the part of their many, treats them, the three who are agreed in
opposition to him, as totally void of understanding, and each one of
them unwise, in expressions like [Job
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#004.md), [Job
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010.md). Looking to [Psa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013.md), 21, one might be tempted to
regard נטמינוּ (on the vowel instead of , vid., Ges. 75, rem. 7) as an
interchange of consonants from נדמינו: be silent, make an end, ye
profligati; but the supposition of this interchange of consonants would
be arbitrary. On the other hand, there is no suitable thought in "why
are we accounted unclean?" (Vulg. sorduimus), from טמה = טמא, [Lev
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#043) (Ges. 75, vi..md); the complaint
would have no right connection, except it were a very slight one, with
[Job 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#009.md). On the contrary, if we
suppose a verb טמה in the signification opplere, obturare, which is
peculiar to this consonant-combination in the whole range of the Semitic
languages (comp. א־טם, Arab. 'ṭm, obstruere, Aram. טמּם, טמטם, Arab.
ṭmm, e.g., Talm.: transgression stoppeth up, מטמטמת, man's heart), and
after which this טמה has been explained by the Jewish expositors
(Raschi: נחשׁבנו טמומים), and is interpreted by סתם (Parchon: נסתמה
דעתנו), we gain a sense which corresponds both with previous reproaches
of Job and the parallelism, and we decide in its favour with the
majority of modern expositors. With the interrogative Wherefore, Bildad
appeals to Job's conscience. These invectives proceed from an
impassioned self-delusion towards the truth, which he wards off from
himself, but cannot however alter.

[Job 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 18:4</span></span>

4 Thou art he who teareth himself in his anger:

Shall the earth become desolate for thy sake,

And a rock remove from its place?

5 Notwithstanding, the light of the wicked shall be put out,

And the glow of his fire shineth not;

6 The light becometh dark in his tent,

And his lamp above him is extinguished;

7 His vigorous steps are straitened,

And his own counsel casteth him down.

The meaning of the strophe is this: Dost thou imagine that, by thy
vehement conduct, by which thou art become enraged against thyself, thou
canst effect any change in the established divine order of the world? It
is a divine law, that sufferings are the punishment of sin; thou canst
no more alter this, than that at thy command, or for thy sake, the
earth, which is appointed to be the habitation of man ([Isa
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018).md), will become desolate (tê‛âzab
with the tone drawn back, according to Ges. 29, 3, b, Arab. with similar
signification in intrans. Kal t‛azibu), or a rock remove from its place
(on יעתּק, vid., [Job 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#018).md). Bildad
here lays to Job's charge what Job, in [Job
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009.md), has said of God's anger, that it
tears him: he himself tears himself in his rage at the inevitable lot
under which he ought penitently to bow. The address, [Job
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#004.md), as apud Arabes ubique fere
(Schult.), is put objectively (not: Oh thou, who); comp. what is said on
כּלּם, [Job 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010.md), which is influenced
by the same syntactic custom. The lxx transl. [Job
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#004.md): Why! will Hades be tenantless if
thou diest (ἐὰν σὺ ἀποθάνῃς)? after which Rosenm. explains: tu caus h.
e. te cadente. But that ought to be הבמוּתך. The peopling of the earth
is only an example of the arrangements of divine omnipotence and wisdom,
the continuance of which is exalted over the human power of volition,
and does not in the least yield to human self-will, as ([Job
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#004).md) the rock is an example, and at
the same time an emblem, of what God has fixed and rendered immoveable.
That of which he here treats as fixed by God is the law of retribution.
However much Job may rage, this law is and remains the unavoidable power
that rules over the evil-doer.

[Job 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#005.md)

גּם is here equivalent to nevertheless, or prop. even, ὅμως, as e.g.,
[Psa 129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002) (Ew. 354, a.md). The light of
the evil-doer goes out, and the comfortable brightness and warmth which
the blaze (שׁביב, only here as a Hebr. word; according to Raschi and
others, tincelle, a spark; but according to lxx, Theod., Syr., Jer., a
flame; Targ. the brightness of light) of his fire in his dwelling throws
out, comes to an end. In one word, as the praet. חשׁך implies, the light
in his tent is changed into darkness; and his lamp above him, i.e., the
lamp hanging from the covering of his tent ([Job
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#003.md), comp. [Job
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017).md), goes out. When misfortune
breaks in upon him, the Arab says: ed-dahru attfaa es-sirâgi, fate has
put out my lamp; this figure of the decline of prosperity receives here
a fourfold application. The figure of straitening one's steps is just as
Arabic as it is biblical; צעדי אונו, the steps of his strength (און
synon. of כּח, [Job 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#016).md) become
narrow (comp. [Pro 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#012.md), Arab.
takâssarat), by the wide space which he could pass over with a
self-confident feeling of power becoming more and more contracted; and
the purpose formed selfishly and without any recognition of God, the
success of which he considered infallible, becomes his overthrow.

[Job 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 18:8</span></span>

8 For he is driven into the net by his own feet,

And he walketh over a snare.

9 The trap holdeth his heel fast,

The noose bindeth him.

10 His snare lieth hidden in the earth,

His nets upon the path;

11 Terrors affright him on every side,

And scare him at every step.

The Pual שׁלּח signifies not merely to be betrayed into, but driven
into, like the Piel, [Job 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#012.md), to
drive away, and as it is to be translated in the similar passage in the
song of Deborah, [Jdg 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#015.md) : "And as
Issachar, Barak was driven (i.e., with desire for fighting) behind him
down into the valley (the place of meeting under Mount Tabor);" בּרגליו,
which there signifies, according to [Jdg
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010.md); [Jdg
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#005.md), "upon his feet = close behind
him," is here intended of the intermediate cause: by his own feet he is
hurried into the net, i.e., against his will, and yet with his own feet
he runs into destruction. The same thing is said in [Job
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#008.md); the way on which he complacently
wanders up and down (which the Hithp. signifies here) is שׂבכה,
lattice-work, here a snare (Arab. schabacah, a net, from שׂבך, schabaca,
to intertwine, weave), and consequently will suddenly break in and bring
him to ruin. This fact of delivering himself over to destruction is
established in apocopated futt. ([Job
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#009).md) used as praes., and without the
voluntative signification in accordance with the poetic licence: a trap
catches a heel (poetic brevity for: the trap catches his heel), a noose
seizes upon him, עליו (but with the accompanying notion of overpowering
him, which the translation "bind" is intended to express). Such is the
meaning of צמּים here, which is not plur., but sing., from צמם (Arab.
ḍmm), to tie, and it unites in itself the meanings of snare-layer ([Job
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#005).md) and of snare; the form (as אבּיר,
אדּיר) corresponds more to the former, but does not, however, exclude
the latter, as תּנּין and לפּיד (λαμπάς) show.

The continuation in [Job 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#010.md) of the
figure of the fowler affirms that that issue of his life ([Job
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#009).md) has been preparing long
beforehand; the prosperity of the evil-doer from the beginning tends
towards ruin. Instead of חבלו we have the pointing חבלו, as it would be
in Arab. in a similar sense hhabluhu (from hhabl, a cord, a net). The
nearer destruction is now to him, the stronger is the hold which his
foreboding has over him, since, as [Job
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#011.md) adds, terrible thoughts
(בּלּהות) and terrible apparitions fill him with dismay, and haunt him,
following upon his feet. לרגליו, close behind him, as [Gen
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#030.md); [Sa1
25:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#042.md); [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md); [Hab
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#005.md). The best authorized pointing of
the verb is והפיצהוּ, with Segol (Ges. 104, 2, c), Chateph-Segol, and
Kibbutz. Except in [Hab 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#014.md), where
the prophet includes himself with his people, הפיץ, diffundere,
dissipare (vid., [Job 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#011.md); [Job
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#011).md), never has a person as its obj.
elsewhere. It would also probably not be used, but for the idea that the
spectres of terror pursue him at every step, and are now here, now
there, and his person is as it were multiplied.

[Job 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 18:12</span></span>

12 His calamity looketh hunger-bitten,

And misfortune is ready for his fall.

13 It devoureth the members of his skin;

The first-born of death devoureth his members.

14 That in which he trusted is torn away out of his tent,

And he must march on to the king of terrors.

15 Beings strange to him dwell in his tent;

Brimstone is strewn over his habitation.

The description of the actual and total destruction of the evil-doer now
begins with יהי (as [Job 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#014.md), after
the manner of the voluntative forms already used in [Job
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#009).md). Step by step it traces his
course to the total destruction, which leaves no trace of him, but still
bears evident marks of being the fulfilment of the curse pronounced upon
him. In opposition to this explanation, Targ., Raschi, and others,
explain אנו according to [Gen 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md) :
the son of his manhood's strength becomes hungry, which sounds comical
rather than tragic; another Targ. transl.: he becomes hungry in his
mourning, which is indeed inadmissible, because the signif. planctus,
luctus, belongs to the derivatives of אנה, אנן, but not to און. But even
the translation recently adopted by Ew., Stick., and Schlottm., "his
strength becomes hungry," is unsatisfactory; for it is in itself no
misfortune to be hungry, and רעב does not in itself signify "exhausted
with hunger." It is also an odd metaphor, that strength becomes hungry;
we would then rather read with Reiske, רעב באנו, famelicus in media
potentia sua. But as און signifies strength ([Job
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#007).md), so און (root אן, to breathe and
pant) signifies both wickedness and evil (the latter either as evil =
calamity, or as anhelitus, sorrow, Arab. ain); and the thought that his
(i.e., appointed to the evil-doer) calamity is hungry to swallow him up
(Syr., Hirz., Hahn, and others), suits the parallelism perfectly: "and
misfortune stands ready for his fall."

(Note: If רעב elsewhere corresponds to the Arabic rugb, to be
voraciously hungry, the Arab. ra‛b, to be paralyzed with fright, might
correspond to it in the present passage: "from all sides spectres alarm
him (בעתהו from בעת = Arab. bgt, to fall suddenly upon any one; or
better: = b‛ṯ, to hunt up, excitare, to cause to rise, to fill with
alarm) and urge him forward, seizing on his heels; then his strength
becomes a paralyzing fright (רעב), and destruction is ready to overwhelm
him." The ro‛b (רעב, thus in Damascus) or ra‛b (רעב, thus in Hauran and
among the Beduins) is a state of mind which only occurs among us in a
lower degree, but among the Arabs it is worthy of note as a
psychological fact. If the wahm (Arab. 'l-whm), or idea of some great
and inevitable danger or misfortune, overpowers the Arab, all strength
of mind and body suddenly forsakes him, so that he breaks down powerless
and defenceless. Thus on July 8, 1860, in Damascus, in a few hours,
about 6000 Christian men were slain, without any one raising a hand or
uttering a cry for mercy. Both European and native doctors have assured
me the ro‛b in Arabia kills, and I have witnessed instances myself.
Since it often produces a stiffness of the limbs with chronic paralysis,
all kinds of paralysis are called ro‛b, and the paralytics mar‛ûb. -
Wetzst.)

איד signifies prop. a weight, burden, then a load of suffering, and gen.
calamity (root אד, Arab. âda, e.g., Sur. 2, 256, la jaâduhu, it is not
difficult for him, and adda, comp. on [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012).md); and לצלעו not: at his side
(Ges., Ew., Schlottm., Hahn), but, according to [Psa
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md); [Psa
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#018.md) : for his fall (lxx freely, but
correctly: ἐξαίσιοϚ); for instead of "at the side" (Arab. ila ganbi),
they no more say in Hebrew than in Germ. "at the ribs."

[Job 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#013.md) figuratively describes how
calamity takes possession of him. The members, which are called יצרים in
[Job 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#007.md), as parts of the form of the
body, are here called בּדּים, as the parts into which the body branches
out, or rather, since the word originally signifies a part, as that
which is actually split off (vid., on [Job
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016), where it denotes "cross-bars".md),
or according to appearance that which rises up, and from this primary
signification applied to the body and plants, the members (not merely as
Farisol interprets: the veins) of which the body consists and into which
it is distributed. עור (distinct from גּלד, [Job
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015.md), similar in meaning to Arab.
baschar, but also to the Arab. gild, of which the former signifies
rather the epidermis, the latter the skin in the widest sense) is the
soluble surface of the naked animal body. בּכור מות devours this, and
indeed, as the repetition implies, gradually, but surely and entirely.
"The first-born of the poor," [Isa
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030.md), are those not merely who belong
(בּני) to the race of the poor, but the poor in the highest sense and
first rank. So here diseases are conceived of as children of death, as
in the Arabic malignant fevers are called benât el-menı̂jeh, daughters of
fate or death; that disease which Bildad has in his mind, as the one
more terrible and dangerous than all others, he calls the "first-born of
death," as that in which the whole destroying power of death is
contained, as in the first-born the whole strength of his parent.

(Note: In Arabic the positive is expressed in the same metonymies with
abu, e.g., abû 'l-chêr, the benevolent; on the other hand, e.g., ibn
el̇hhâge is much stronger than abu 'l-hhâge: the person who is called ibn
is conceived of as a child of these conditions; they belong to his
inmost nature, and have not merely affected him slightly and passed off.
The Hebrew בכור represents the superlative, because among Semites the
power and dignity of the father is transmitted to the first-born. So far
as I know, the Arab does not use this superlative; for what is terrible
and revolting he uses "mother," e.g., umm el-fâritt, mother of death, a
name for the plague (in one of the modern popular poets of Damascus),
umm el-quashshâsh, mother of the sweeping death, a name for war (in the
same); for that which awakens the emotions of joy and grief he
frequently uses "daughter." In an Arabian song of victory the fatal
arrows are called benât el-môt, and the heroes (slayers) in the battle
benı̂ el-môt, which is similar to the figure used in the book of Job.
Moreover, that disease which eats up the limbs could not be described by
a more appropriate epithet than בכור מות. Its proper name is shunned in
common life; and if it is necessary to mention those who are affected
with it, they always say sâdât el-gudhamâ to avoid offending the
company, or to escape the curse of the thing mentioned. - Wetzst.)

The Targ. understands the figure similarly, since it transl. מלאך מותא
(angel of death); another Targ. has instead שׁרוּי מותא, the firstling
of death, which is intended in the sense of the primogenita (=
praematura) mors of Jerome. Least of all is it to be understood with
Ewald as an intensive expression for בן־מות, [Sa1
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#031.md), of the evil-doer as liable to
death. While now disease in the most fearful form consumes the body of
the evil-doer, מבטחו (with Dag.f. impl., as [Job
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014.md); [Job
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024), Olsh. 198, b.md) (a collective
word, which signifies everything in which he trusted) is torn away out
of his tent; thus also Rosenm., Ew., and Umbr. explain, while Hirz.,
Hlgst., Schlottm., and Hahn regard מבטחו as in apposition to אהלו, in
favour of which [Job 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014.md) is only a
seemingly suitable parallel. It means everything that made the ungodly
man happy as head of a household, and gave him the brightest hopes of
the future. This is torn away (evellitur) from his household, so that
he, who is dying off, alone survives. Thus, therefore, [Job
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#014.md) describes how he also himself
dies at last. Several modern expositors, especially Stickel, after the
example of Jerome (et calcet super eum quasi rex interitus), and of the
Syr. (praecipitem eum reddent terrores regis), take בּלּהות as subj.,
which is syntactically possible (vid., [Job
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#020.md); [Job
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#015).md): and destruction causes him to
march towards itself (Ges.: fugant eum) like a military leader; but
since הצעיד signifies to cause to approach, and since no אליו (to
itself) stands with it, למלך is to be considered as denoting the goal,
especially as ל never directly signifies instar. In the passage advanced
in its favour it denotes that which anything becomes, that which one
makes a thing by the mode of treatment ([Job
39:16](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#016).md), or whither anything extends
(e.g., in Schultens on [Job 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#012.md) :
they had claws li-machlbi, i.e., "approaching to the claws" of wild
beasts).

(Note: Comp a note infra on [Job 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#004.md).
- Tr.)

One falls into these strange interpretations when one departs from the
accentuation, which unites מלך בלהות quite correctly by Munach.

Death itself is called "the king of terrors," in distinction from the
terrible disease which is called its first-born. Death is also
personified elsewhere, as [Isa 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015.md),
and esp. [Psa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015.md), where it appears
as a רעה, ruler in Hades, as in the Indian mythology the name of the
infernal king Jamas signifies the tyrant or the tamer. The biblical
representation does not recognise a king of Hades, as Jamas and Pluto:
the judicial power of death is allotted to angels, of whom one, the
angel of the abyss, is called Abaddon (אבדון), [Rev
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011.md); and the chief possessor of this
judicial power, ὁ τὸδράτος ἔχων τοῦ θανάτον, is, according to [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md), the angel-prince, who, according
to the prologue of our book, has also brought a fatal disease upon Job,
without, however, in this instance being able to go further than to
bring him to the brink of the abyss. It would therefore not be contrary
to the spirit of the book if we were to understand Satan by the king of
terrors, who, among other appellations in Jewish theology, is called שׂר
על־התהו, because he has his existence in the Thohu, and seeks to hurl
back every living being into the Thohu. But since the prologue casts a
veil over that which remains unknown in this world in the midst of
tragic woes, and since a reference to Satan is found nowhere else in the
book - on the contrary, Job himself and the friends trace back directly
to God that mysterious affliction which forms the dramatic knot - we
understand (which is perfectly sufficient) by the king of terrors death
itself, and with Hirz., Ew., and most expositors, transl.: "and it
causes him to march onward to the king of terrors." The "it" is a secret
power, as also elsewhere the fem. is used as neut. to denote the "dark
power" (Ewald, 294, b) of natural and supernatural events, although
sometimes, e.g., [Job 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#016.md); [Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md), the masc. is also so applied.
After the evil-doer is tormented for a while with temporary בלהות, and
made tender, and reduced to ripeness for death by the first-born of
death, he falls into the possession of the king of בלהות himself; slowly
and solemnly, but surely and inevitably (as תצעיד implies, with which is
combined the idea of the march of a criminal to the place of execution),
he is led to this king by an unseen arm.

In [Job 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015.md) the description advances
another step deeper into the calamity of the evil-doer's habitation,
which is now become completely desolate. Since [Job
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015.md) says that brimstone (from
heaven, [Gen 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md); [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006).md) is strewn over the evil-doer's
habitation, i.e., in order to mark it as a place that, having been
visited with the fulfilment of the curse, shall not henceforth be
rebuilt and inhabited (vid., [Deu
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md)., and supra, on [Job
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028).md), [Job
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015.md) cannot be intended to affirm
that a company of men strange to him take up their abode in his tent.
But we shall not, however, on that account take בלהות as the subj. of
תּשׁכּון. The only natural translation is: what does not belong to him
dwells in his tent (Ew. 294, b); מבּלי, elsewhere praepos. ([Job
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#011.md), [Job
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020.md); [Job
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#007)..md), is here an adverb of negation,
as which it is often used as an intensive of אין, e.g., [Exo
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011.md). It is unnecessary to take the מ
as partitive (Hirz.), although it can have a special signification, as
[Deu 28:55](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#055) (because not.md), by being
separated from בלי. The neutral fem. תשׁכון refers to such inhabitants
as are described in [Isa 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md)., [Job
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#010.md)., [Job
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#011.md)., [Zep
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009.md), and in other descriptions of
desolation. Creatures and things which are strange to the deceased rich
man, as jackals and nettles, inhabit his domain, which is appointed to
eternal unfruitfulness; neither children nor possessions survive him to
keep up his name. What does dwell in his tent serves only to keep up the
recollection of the curse which has overtaken him.

(Note: The desolation of his house is the most terrible calamity for the
Semite, i.e., when all belonging to his family die or are reduced to
poverty, their habitation is desolated, and their ruins are become the
byword of future generations. For the Beduin especially, although his
hair tent leaves no mark, the thought of the desolation of his house,
the extinction of his hospitable hearth, is terrible. - Wetzst.)

[Job 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 18:16</span></span>

16 His roots wither beneath,

And above his branch is lopped off.

17 His remembrance is vanished from the land,

And he hath no name far and wide on the plain;

18 They drive him from light into darkness,

And chase him out of the world.

19 He hath neither offspring nor descendant among his people,

Nor is there an escaped one in his dwellings.

The evil-doer is represented under the figure of a plant, [Job
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016.md), as we have had similar figures
already, [Job 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#016.md)., [Job
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030.md), [Job
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032.md).;

(Note: To such biblical figures taken from plants, according to which
root and branch are become familiar in the sense of ancestors and
descendants (comp. Sir. 23:25, 40:15; Wisd. 4:3-5; [Rom
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016).md), the arbor consanguineitatis,
which is not Roman, but is become common in the Christian refinement of
the Roman right, may be traced back; the first trace of this is found in
Isidorus Hispalensis (as also the Cabbalistic tree אילן, which
represents the Sephir-genealogy, has its origin in Spain).)

his complete extirpation is like the dying off of the root and of the
branch, as [Amo 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009.md); [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md), and "let him not have a root
below and a branch above" in the inscription on the sarcophagus of
Eschmunazar. Here we again meet with ימּל, the proper meaning of which
is so disputed; it is translated by the Targ. (as by us) as Niph.
יתמולל, but the meaning "to wither" is near at hand, which, as we said
on [Job 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002.md), may be gained as well
from the primary notion "to fall to pieces" (whence lxx ἐπιπεσεῖται), as
from the primary notion "to parch, dry." אמל (whence אמלל, formed after
the manner of the Arabic IX. form, usually of failing; vid., Caspari,
59) offers a third possible explanation; it signifies originally to be
long and lax, to let anything hang down, and thence in Arab. (amala) to
hope, i.e., to look out into the distance. Not the evil-doer's family
alone is rooted out, but also his memory. With חוּץ, a very relative
notion, both the street outside in front of the house ([Job
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#032).md), and the pasture beyond the
dwelling ([Job 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#010).md), are described;
here it is to be explained according to [Pro
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#026) (ארץ וחוצות.md), where Hitz.
remarks: "The lxx translates correctly ἀοικήτους. The districts beyond
each persons' land, which also belong to no one else, the desert,
whither one goes forth, is meant." So ארץ seems also here (comp. [Job
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008).md) to denote the land that is
regularly inhabited - Job himself is a large proprietor within the range
of a city ([Job 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007).md) - and חוץ the
steppe traversed by the wandering tribes which lies out beyond. Thus
also the Syr. version transl. 'al apai barito, over the plain of the
desert, after which the Arabic version is el-barrı̂je (the synon. of
bedw, bâdije, whence the name of the Beduin

(Note: The village with its meadow-land is el-beled wa 'l-berr. The
arable land, in distinction from the steppe, is el-ardd el-âmira, and
the steppe is el-berrı̂je. If both are intended, ardd can be used alone.
Used specially, el-berrı̂je is the proper name for the great Syrian
desert; hence the proverb: el-hhurrı̂je fi 'l-berrı̇je, there is freedom
in the steppe (not in towns and villages). - Wetzst.)).

What is directly said in [Job 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#017.md) is
repeated figuratively in [Job 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#018.md);
as also what has been figuratively expressed in [Job
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016.md) is repeated in [Job
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#019.md) without figure. The subj. of the
verbs in [Job 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#018.md) remains in the
background, as [Job 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019.md); [Psa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#011.md); [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md) : they thrust him out of the
light (of life, prosperity, and fame) into the darkness (of misfortune,
death, and oblivion); so that the illustris becomes not merely
ignobilis, but totally ignotus, and they hunt him forth (ינדּהוּ from
the Hiph. הנד of the verb נדד, instead of which it might also be ינדהו
from נדּה, they banish him) out of the habitable world (for this is the
signification of תּבל, the earth as built upon and inhabited). There
remains to him in his race neither sprout nor shoot; thus the rhyming
alliteration נין and נכד (according to Luzzatto on [Isa
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#022.md), used only of the descendants of
persons in high rank, and certainly a nobler expression than our rhyming
pairs: Germ. Stumpf und Stiel, Mann und Maus, Kind und Kegel). And there
is no escaped one (as [Deu 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034.md) and
freq., Arab. shârid, one fleeing; sharûd, a fugitive) in his abodes
(מגוּר, as only besides [Psa 55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016).md).
Thus to die away without descendant and remembrance is still at the
present day among the Arab races that profess Dı̂n Ibrâhı̂m (the religion
of Abraham) the most unhappy thought, for the point of gravitation of
continuance beyond the grave is transferred by them to the immortality
of the righteous in the continuance of his posterity and works in this
world (vid., supra, p. 386); and where else should it be at the time of
Job, since no revelation had as yet drawn the curtain aside from the
future world? Now follows the declamatory conclusion of the speech.

[Job 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 18:20</span></span>

20 Those who dwell in the west are astonished at his day,

And trembling seizeth those who dwell in the east;

21 Surely thus it befalleth the dwellings of the unrighteous,

And thus the place of him that knew not God.

It is as much in accordance with the usage of Arabic as it is biblical,
to call the day of a man's doom "his day," the day of a battle at a
place "the day of that place." Who are the אחרנים who are astonished at
it, and the קדמנים whom terror (שׂער as twice besides in this sense in
Ezek.) seizes, or as it is properly, who seize terror, i.e., of
themselves, without being able to do otherwise than yield to the emotion
(as [Job 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#006.md); [Isa
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008.md); comp. on the contrary [Exo
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014)..md)? Hirz., Schlottm., Hahn, and
others, understand posterity by אחרנים, and by קדמנים their ancestors,
therefore Job's contemporaries. But the return from the posterity to
those then living is strange, and the usage of the language is opposed
to it; for קדמנים is elsewhere always what belongs to the previous age
in relation to the speaker (e.g., [Sa1
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#014.md), comp. [Ecc
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#016).md). Since, then, קדמני is used in
the signification eastern (e.g., הים הקדמוני, the eastern sea = the Dead
Sea), and אחרון in the signification western (e.g., הים האחרון, the
western sea = the Mediterranean), it is much more suited both to the
order of the words and the usage of the language to understand, with
Schult., Oetinger, Umbr., and Ew., the former of those dwelling in the
west, and the latter of those dwelling in the east. In the summarizing
[Job 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#021.md), the retrospective pronouns
are also praegn., like [Job 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019.md); [Job
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029.md), comp. [Job
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014.md) : Thus is it, viz., according to
their fate, i.e., thus it befalls them; and אך here retains its original
affirmative signification (as in the concluding verse of [Psa
58:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001).md), although in Hebrew this is
blended with the restrictive. וזה has Rebia mugrasch instead of great
Schalscheleth,

(Note: Vid., Psalter ii. 503, and comp. Davidson, Outlines of Hebrew
Accentuation (1861), p. 92, note.)

and מקום has in correct texts Legarme, which must be followed by לא־ידע
with Illuj on the penult. On the relative clause לא־ידע אל without אשׁר,
comp. e.g., [Job 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#016.md); and on this
use of the st. constr., vid., Ges. 116, 3. The last verse is as though
those mentioned in [Job 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#020.md) pointed
with the finger to the example of punishment in the "desolated"
dwellings which have been visited by the curse.

This second speech of Bildad begins, like the first ([Job
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002).md), with the reproach of endless
babbling; but it does not end like the first ([Job
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#022).md). The first closed with the
words: "Thy haters shall be clothed with shame, and the tent of the
godless is no more," the second is only an amplification of the second
half of this conclusion, without taking up again anywhere the tone of
promise, which there also embraces the threatening.

It is manifest also from this speech, that the friends, to express it in
the words of the old commentators, know nothing of evangelical but only
of legal suffering, and also only of legal, nothing of evangelical,
righteousness. For the righteousness of which Job boasts is not the
righteousness of single works of the law, but of a disposition directed
to God, of conduct proceeding from faith, or (as the Old Testament
generally says) from trust in God's mercy, the weaknesses of which are
forgiven because they are exonerated by the habitual disposition of the
man and the primary aim of his actions. The fact that the principle,
"suffering is the consequence of human unrighteousness," is accounted by
Bildad as the formula of an inviolable law of the moral order of the
world, is closely connected with that outward aspect of human
righteousness. One can only thus judge when one regards human
righteousness and human destiny from the purely legal point of view. A
man, as soon as we conceive him in faith, and therefore under grace, is
no longer under that supposed exclusive fundamental law of the divine
dealing. Brentius is quite right when he observes that the sentence of
the law certainly is modified for the sake of the godly who have the
word of promise. Bildad knows nothing of the worth and power which a man
attains by a righteous heart. By faith he is removed from the domain of
God's justice, which recompenses according to the law of works; and
before the power of faith even rocks move from their place.

Bildad then goes off into a detailed description of the total
destruction into which the evil-doer, after going about for a time
oppressed with the terrors of his conscience as one walking over snares,
at last sinks beneath a painful sickness. The description is terribly
brilliant, solemn, and pathetic, as becomes the stern preacher of
repentance with haughty mien and pharisaic self-confidence; it is none
the less beautiful, and, considered in itself, also true - a masterpiece
of the poet's skill in poetic idealizing, and in apportioning out the
truth in dramatic form. The speech only becomes untrue through the
application of the truth advanced, and this untruthfulness the poet has
most delicately presented in it. For with a view of terrifying Job,
Bildad interweaves distinct references to Job in his description; he
knows, however, also how to conceal them under the rich drapery of
diversified figures. The first-born of death, that hands the ungodly
over to death itself, the king of terrors, by consuming the limbs of the
ungodly, is the Arabian leprosy, which slowly destroys the body. The
brimstone indicates the fire of God, which, having fallen from heaven,
has burned up one part of the herds and servants of Job; the withering
of the branch, the death of Job's children, whom he himself, as a
drying-up root that will also soon die off, has survived. Job is the
ungodly man, who, with wealth, children, name, and all that he
possessed, is being destroyed as an example of punishment for posterity
both far and near.

But, in reality, Job is not an example of punishment, but an example for
consolation to posterity; and what posterity has to relate is not Job's
ruin, but his wondrous deliverance ([Psa
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031)..md). He is no עוּל, but a
righteous man; not one who לא ידע־אל, but he knows God better than the
friends, although he contends with Him, and they defend Him. It is with
him as with the righteous One, who complains, [Psa
69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021.md) : "Contempt hath broken my
heart, and I became sick: I hoped for sympathy, but in vain; for
comforters, and found none;" and [Psa
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#012.md) (comp. [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012.md); [Psa
55:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#013.md); [Psa
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md); [Psa
88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009), 19.md): "My lovers and my friends
stand aloof from my stroke, and my kinsmen stand afar off." Not without
a deep purpose does the poet make Bildad to address Job in the plural.
The address is first directed to Job alone; nevertheless it is so put,
that what Bildad says to Job is also intended to be said to others of a
like way of thinking, therefore to a whole party of the opposite opinion
to himself. Who are these like-minded? Hirzel rightly refers to [Job
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#008.md). Job is the representative of the
suffering and misjudged righteous, in other words: of the
"congregation," whose blessedness is hidden beneath an outward form of
suffering. One is hereby reminded that in the second part of Isaiah the
יהוה עבד is also at one time spoken of in the sing., and at another time
in the plur.; since this idea, by a remarkable contraction and expansion
of expression (systole and diastole), at one time describes the one
servant of Jehovah, and at another the congregation of the servants of
Jehovah, which has its head in Him. Thus we again have a trace of the
fact that the poet is narrating a history that is of universal
significance, and that, although Job is no mere personification, he has
in him brought forth to view an idea connected with the history of
redemption. The ancient interpreters were on the track of this idea when
they said in their way, that in Job we behold the image of Christ, and
the figure of His church. Christi personam figuraliter gessit, says
Beda; and Gregory, after having stated and explained that there is not
in the Old Testament a righteous man who does not typically point to
Christ, says: Beatus Iob venturi cum suo corpore typum redemtoris
insinuat.
