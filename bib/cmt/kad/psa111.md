Alphabetical Song in Praise of God

With [Psa 111:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md) begins a trilogy of
Hallelujah-Psalms. It may be appended to [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), because it places the "for
ever" of [Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md) in broader light
in relation to the history of redemption, by stringing praise upon
praise of the deeds of Jahve and of His appointments. It stands in the
closest relationship to [Psa 112:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001.md).
Whilst [Psa 111:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md), as Hitzig
correctly says, celebrates the glory, might, and loving-kindness of
Jahve in the circle of the "upright," [Psa
112:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001.md) celebrates the glory flowing
therefrom and the happiness of the "upright" themselves, of those who
fear Jahve. The two Psalms are twin in form as in contents. They are a
mixture of materials taken from older Psalms and gnomical utterances;
both are sententious, and both alphabetical. Each consists of twenty-two
lines with the twenty-two letters of the alphabet at the beginning,

(Note: Bttcher transposes the verses in [Psa
111:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md), and in [Psa
112:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005.md) corrects יכלכל into וכלכל; in
the warmth of his critical zeal he runs against the boundary-posts of
the letters marking the order, without observing it.)

and every line for the most part consists of three words. Both songs are
only chains of acrostic lines without any strophic grouping, and
therefore cannot be divided out. The analogous accentuation shows how
strong is the impression of the close relationship of this twin pair;
and both Psalms also close, in [Psa
111:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#009.md) and [Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md), with two verses of three
members, being up to this point divided into verses of two members.

[Psalms 111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md)

That which the poet purposes doing in [Psa
111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md), he puts into execution from
[Psa 111:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002.md) onwards. ועדה, according to
[Psa 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007.md); [Psa
118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014.md), is equivalent to ועדתם.
According to [Psa 111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md), הפציהם in
[Psa 111:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002.md) apparently signifies those
who find pleasure in them (the works of God); but חפצי = חפצי (like
שׂמחי, [Isa 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#007) = שׂמחי.md) is less
natural than that it should be the construct form of the plural of חפץ,
that occurs in three instances, and there was no need for saying that
those who make the works of God the object of their research are such as
interest themselves in them. We are led to the right meaning by לכל־חפצו
in [Kg1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011.md) in comparison with [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md); [Isa
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010.md), cf. [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md), where חפץ signifies God's
purpose in accordance with His counsel: constantly searched into, and
therefore a worthy object of research (דרשׁ, root דר, to seek to know by
rubbing, and in general experimentally, cf. Arab. drâ of knowledge
empirically acquired) according to all their aims, i.e., in all phases
of that which they have in view. In [Psa
111:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#004.md) זכר points to the festival which
propagates the remembrance of the deeds of God in the Mosaic age; טרף,
[Psa 111:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#005.md), therefore points to the
food provided for the Exodus, and to the Passover meal, together with
the feast of unleavened bread, this memorial (זכּרון, [Exo
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014).md) of the exemption in
faithfulness to the covenant which was experienced in Egypt. This Psalm,
says Luther, looks to me as though it had been composed for the festival
of Easter. Even from the time of Theodoret and Augustine the thought of
the Eucharist has been connected with [Psa
111:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#005.md) in the New Testament mind; and
it is not without good reason that [Psa
111:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md) has become the Psalm of the
church at the celebration of the Lord's Supper. In connection with הגּיד
one is reminded of the Pesach-Haggada. The deed of redemption which it
relates has a power that continues in operation; for to the church of
Jahve is assigned the victory not only over the peoples of Canaan, but
over the whole world. The power of Jahve's deeds, which He has made
known to His people, and which they tell over again among themselves,
aims at giving them the inheritance of the peoples. The works of His
hands are truth and right, for they are the realization of that which is
true and which lasts and verifies itself, and of that which is right,
that triumphantly maintains its ground. His ordinances are נאמנים
(occasionally pointed נאמנים), established, attested, in themselves and
in their results authorizing a firm confidence in their salutariness
(cf. [Psa 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#008).md). סמוּכים, supported,
stayed, viz., not outwardly, but in themselves, therefore imperturbable
(cf. סמוּך used of the state of mind, [Psa
112:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#008.md); [Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003).md). עשׂוּים, moulded, arranged,
viz., on the part of God, "in truth, and upright;" ישׂר is accusative of
the predicate (cf. [Psa 119:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#037).md), but
without its being clear why it is not pointed וישׁר. If we have
understood [Psa 111:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#004.md) correctly,
then פּדוּת glances back at the deliverance out of Egypt. Upon this
followed the ratification of the covenant on Sinai, which still remains
inviolable down to the present time of the poet, and has the holiness
and terribleness of the divine Name for a guarantee of its
inviolability. The fear of Jahve, this holy and terrible God, is the
beginning of wisdom - the motto of the Chokma in Job ([Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028).md) and Proverbs ([Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md); [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010).md), the Books of the Chokma. [Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md) goes on in this Proverbs-like
strain: the fear of God, which manifests itself in obedience, is to
those who practise them (the divine precepts, פקודים) שׂכל טּוב ([Pro
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#015.md); [Pro
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004.md), cf. [Ch2
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022).md), a fine sagacity, praiseworthy
discernment - such a (dutiful) one partakes of everlasting praise. It is
true, in glancing back to [Psa 111:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#003.md),
תּהלּתו seems to refer to God, but a glance forward to [Psa
112:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#003.md) shows that the praise of him who
fears God is meant. The old observation therefore holds good: ubi haec
ode desinit, sequens incipit (Bakius).
