Exhortation to a Faithful Observance of the Law - Deuteronomy 4:1-40

With the word ועתּה, "and now," Moses passes from a contemplation of
what the Lord had done for Israel, to an exhortation to keep the law of
the Lord. The divine manifestations of grace laid Israel under the
obligation to a conscientious observance of the law, that they might
continue to enjoy the blessings of the covenant. The exhortation
commences with the appeal, to hear and keep the commandments and rights
of the Lord, without adding to them or taking from them; for not only
were life and death suspended upon their observance, but it was in this
that the wisdom and greatness of Israel before all the nations consisted
([Deu 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001)). It then proceeds to a
warning, not to forget the events at Horeb ([Deu
4:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009)) and so fall into idolatry, the
worship of images or idol deities ([Deu
4:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015)); and it closes with a threat
of dispersion among the heathen as the punishment of apostasy, and with
a promise of restoration as the consequence of repentance and sincere
conversion ([Deu 4:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#025)), and also
with a reason for this threat and promise drawn from the history of the
immediate past ([Deu 4:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#032)), for the
purpose of fortifying the nation in its fidelity to its God, the sole
author of its salvation ([Deu
4:35-40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#035)).

[Deuteronomy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 4:1</span></span>

The Israelites were to hearken to the laws and rights which Moses taught
to do (that they were to do), that they might live and attain to the
possession of the land which the Lord would give them. "Hearkening"
involves laying to heart and observing. The words "statutes and
judgments" (as in [Lev 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#037)) denote
the whole of the law of the covenant in its two leading features. חקּים,
statutes, includes the moral commandments and statutory covenant laws,
for which חק and חקּה are mostly used in the earlier books; that is to
say, all that the people were bound to observe; משׁפּטים, rights, all
that was due to them, whether in relation to God or to their fellow-men
(cf. [Deu 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#017)). Sometimes המּצוה,
the commandment, is connected with it, either placed first in the
singular, as a general comprehensive notion ([Deu
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#028); [Deu
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#001); [Deu
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#011)), or in the plural ([Deu
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#011); [Deu
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001); [Deu
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#016)); or העדת, the testimonies, the
commandments as a manifestation of the will of God ([Deu
4:45](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#045), [Deu
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#017), [Deu
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#020)). - Life itself depended upon the
fulfilment or long life in the promised land ([Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012)), as Moses repeatedly impressed
upon them (cf. [Deu 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040); [Deu
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#030); [Deu
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#002); [Deu
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001); [Deu
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#021); [Deu
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#020); [Deu
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#015); [Deu
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#006), [Deu
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015)., [Deu
32:47](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#047)). ירשׁתּם, for ירשׁתּם (as in
[Deu 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#022), [Jos
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#016); cf. Ges. 44, 2, Anm. 2).

[Deu 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002)

The observance of the law, however, required that it should be kept as
it was given, that nothing should be added to it or taken from it, but
that men should submit to it as to the inviolable word of God. Not by
omissions only, but by additions also, was the commandment weakened, and
the word of God turned into ordinances of men, as Pharisaism
sufficiently proved. This precept is repeated in [Deu
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001); it is then revived by the
prophets ([Jer 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#002); [Pro
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006)), and enforced again at the close
of the whole revelation ([Rev
22:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#018)). In the same sense Christ
also said that He had not come to destroy the law or the prophets, but
to fulfil ([Mat 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017)); and the old
covenant was not abrogated, but only glorified and perfected, by the
new.

[Deu 4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#003)

The Israelites had just experienced how a faithful observance of the law
gave life, in what the Lord had done on account of Baal-peor, when He
destroyed those who worshipped this idol ([Num
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003), [Num
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009)), whereas the faithful followers
of the Lord still remained alive. בּ דּבק, to cleave to any one, to hold
fast to him. This example was adduced by Moses, because the congregation
had passed through all this only a very short time before; and the
results of faithfulness towards the Lord on the one hand, and of the
unfaithfulness of apostasy from Him on the other, had been made
thoroughly apparent to it. "Your eyes the seeing," as in [Deu
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#021).

[Deu 4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#005)

But the laws which Moses taught were commandments of the Lord. Keeping
and doing them were to be the wisdom and understanding of Israel in the
eyes of the nations, who, when they heard all these laws, would say,
"Certainly (רק, only, no other than) a wise and understanding people is
this great nation." History has confirmed this. Not only did the wisdom
of a Solomon astonish the queen of Sheba ([Kg1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#004).), but the divine truth which
Israel possessed in the law of Moses attracted all the more earnest
minds of the heathen world to seek the satisfaction of the inmost
necessities of their heart and the salvation of their souls in Israel's
knowledge of God, when, after a short period of bloom, the inward
self-dissolution of the heathen religions had set in; and at last, in
Christianity, it has brought one heathen nation after another to the
knowledge of the true God, and to eternal salvation, notwithstanding the
fact that the divine truth was and still is regarded as folly by the
proud philosophers and self-righteous Epicureans and Stoics of ancient
and modern times.

[Deu 4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007)

This mighty and attractive force of the wisdom of Israel consisted in
the fact, that in Jehovah they possessed a God who was at hand with His
help when they called upon Him (cf. [Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029); [Psa
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#019); [Psa
145:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018); [Kg1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007)), as none of the gods of the other
nations had ever been; and that in the law of God they possessed such
statutes and rights as the heathen never had. True right has its roots
in God; and with the obscuration of the knowledge of God, law and right,
with their divinely established foundations, are also shaken and
obscured (cf. [Rom 1:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026)).

[Deuteronomy 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 4:9</span></span>

Israel was therefore not to forget the things which it had seen at Horeb
with its own eyes.

[Deu 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009)

"Only beware and take care of thyself." To "keep the soul," i.e., to
take care of the soul as the seat of life, to defend one's life from
danger and injury ([Pro 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#003); [Pro
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#016)). "That thou do not forget
את־הדּברים (the facts described in Ex 19-24), and that they do not
depart from thy heart all the days of thy life," i.e., are not forgotten
as long as thou livest, "and thou makest them known to thy children and
thy children's children." These acts of God formed the foundation of the
true religion, the real basis of the covenant legislation, and the firm
guarantee of the objective truth and divinity of all the laws and
ordinances which Moses gave to the people. And it was this which
constituted the essential distinction between the religion of the Old
Testament and all heathen religions, whose founders, it is true,
professed to derive their doctrines and statutes from divine
inspiration, but without giving any practical guarantee that their
origin was truly divine.

[Deu 4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010)

In the words, "The day (היּום, adverbial accusative) "that thou stoodest
before Jehovah thy God at Horeb," etc., Moses reminds the people of the
leading features of those grand events: first of all of the fact that
God directed him to gather the people together, that He might make known
His words to them ([Exo 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009).), that
they were to learn to fear Him all their life long, and to teach their
children also (יראה, inf., like שׂנאה, [Deu
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#027)); and secondly ([Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011)), that they came near to the
mountain which burned in fire (cf. [Exo
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#017).). The expression, burning in
fire "even to the heart of heaven," i.e., quite into the sky, is a
rhetorical description of the awful majesty of the pillar of fire, in
which the glory of the Lord appeared upon Sinai, intended to impress
deeply upon the minds of the people the remembrance of this
manifestation of God. And the expression, "darkness, clouds, and thick
darkness," which is equivalent to the smoking of the great mountain
([Exo 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018)), is employed with the
same object. And lastly ([Deu 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#012),
[Deu 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#013)), he reminds them that the
Lord spoke out of the midst of the fire, and adds this important remark,
to prepare the way for what is to follow, "Ye heard the sound of the
words, but ye did not see a shape," which not only agrees most fully
with Ex 24, where it is stated that the sight of the glory of Jehovah
upon the mountain appeared to the people as they stood at the foot of
the mountain "like devouring fire" ([Deu
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#017)), and that even the elders who
"saw God" upon the mountain at the conclusion of the covenant saw no
form of God ([Deu 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011)), but also with
[Exo 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020), [Exo
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#023), according to which no man can
see the face (פּנים) of God. Even the similitude (Temunah) of Jehovah,
which Moses saw when the Lord spoke to him mouth to mouth ([Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008)), was not the form of the
essential being of God which was visible to his bodily eyes, but simply
a manifestation of the glory of God answering to his own intuition and
perceptive faculty, which is not to be regarded as a form of God which
was an adequate representation of the divine nature. The true God has no
such form which is visible to the human eye.

[Deu 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#013)

The Israelites, therefore, could not see a form of God, but could only
hear the voice of His words, when the Lord proclaimed His covenant to
them, and gave utterance to the ten words, which He afterwards gave to
Moses written upon two tables of stone ([Exo
20:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001) \[17\], and [Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018), compared with [Exo
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012)). On the "tables of stone," see
at [Exo 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001).

[Deu 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#014)

When the Lord Himself had made known to the people in the ten words the
covenant which He commanded them to do, He directed Moses to teach them
laws and rights which they were to observe in Canaan, viz., the rights
and statutes of the Sinaitic legislation, from Ex 21 onwards.

[Deuteronomy 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 4:15</span></span>

As the Israelites had seen no shape of God at Horeb, they were to beware
for their souls' sake (for their lives) of acting corruptly, and making
to themselves any kind of image of Jehovah their God, namely, as the
context shows, to worship God in it. (On pesel, see at [Exo
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004).) The words which follow, viz.,
"a form of any kind of sculpture," and "a representation of male or
female" (for tabnith, see at [Exo
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#009)), are in apposition to "graven
image," and serve to explain and emphasize the prohibition.

[Deuteronomy 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 4:17</span></span>

They were also not to make an image of any kind of beast; a caution
against imitating the animal worship of Egypt.

[Deuteronomy 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 4:19</span></span>

They were not to allow themselves to be torn away (נדּח) to worship the
stars of heaven, namely, by the seductive influence exerted upon the
senses by the sight of the heavenly bodies as they shone in their
glorious splendour. The reason for this prohibition is given in the
relative clause, "which Jehovah thy God hath allotted to all nations
under the whole heaven." The thought is not, "God has given the heathen
the sun, moon, and stars for service, i.e., to serve them with their
light," as Onkelos, the Rabbins, Jerome, and others, suppose, but He has
allotted them to them for worship, i.e., permitted them to choose them
as the objects of their worship, which is the view adopted by Justin
Martyr, Clemens Alex., and others. According to the scriptural view,
even the idolatry of the heathen existed by divine permission and
arrangement. God gave up the heathen to idolatry and shameful lusts,
because, although they knew Him from His works, they did not praise Him
as God ([Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021), [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024), [Rom
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026)).

[Deuteronomy 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 4:20</span></span>

The Israelites were not to imitate the heathen in this respect, because
Jehovah, who brought them out of the iron furnace of Egypt, had taken
them (לקח) to Himself, i.e., had drawn them out or separated them from
the rest of the nations, to be a people of inheritance. They were
therefore not to seek God and pray to Him in any kind of creature, but
to worship Him without image and form, in a manner corresponding to His
own nature, which had been manifested in no form, and therefore could
not be imitated. בּרזל כּוּר, an iron furnace, or furnace for smelting
iron, is a significant figure descriptive of the terrible sufferings
endured by Israel in Egypt. נחלה עם (a people of inheritance) is
synonymous with סגלּה עם (a special people, [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006) : see at [Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005), "a peculiar treasure"). "This
day:" as in [Deu 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030).

[Deuteronomy 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 4:21</span></span>

The bringing of Israel out of Egypt reminds Moses of the end, viz.,
Canaan, and leads him to mention again how the Lord had refused him
permission to enter into this good land; and to this he adds the renewed
warning not to forget the covenant or make any image of God, since
Jehovah, as a jealous God, would never tolerate this. The swearing
attributed to God in [Deu 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#021) is
neither mentioned in Num 20 nor at the announcement of Moses' death in
[Num 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012).; but it is not to be
called in question on that account, as Knobel supposes. It is perfectly
obvious from [Deu 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#023). that all the
details are not given in the historical account of the event referred
to. כּל תּמוּנת פּסל, "image of a form of all that Jehovah has
commanded," sc., not to be made ([Deu
4:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#016)). "A consuming fire" ([Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024)): this epithet is applied to God
with special reference to the manifestation of His glory in burning fire
([Exo 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#017)). On the symbolical
meaning of this mode of revelation, see at [Exo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002). "A jealous God:" see at [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).

[Deuteronomy 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 4:25</span></span>

To give emphasis to this warning, Moses holds up the future dispersion
of the nation among the heathen as the punishment of apostasy from the
Lord.

[Deu 4:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#025)

If the Israelites should beget children and children's children, and
grow old in the land, and then should make images of God, and do that
which was displeasing to God to provoke Him; in that case Moses called
upon heaven and earth as witnesses against them, that they should be
quickly destroyed out of the land. "Growing old in the land" involved
forgetfulness of the former manifestations of grace on the part of the
Lord, but not necessarily becoming voluptuous through the enjoyment of
the riches of the land, although this might also lead to forgetfulness
of God and the manifestations of His grace (cf. [Deu
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#010)., [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015)). The apodosis commences with
[Deu 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026). העיד, with בּ and the
accusative, to take or summon as a witness against a person. Heaven and
earth do not stand here for the rational beings dwelling in them, but
are personified, represented as living, and capable of sensation and
speech, and mentioned as witnesses who would raise up against Israel,
not to proclaim its guilt, but to bear witness that God, the Lord of
heaven and earth, had warned the people, and, as it is described in the
parallel passage in [Deu 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019), had
set before them the choice of life and death, and therefore was just in
punishing them for their unfaithfulness (cf. [Psa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#006); [Psa
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006)). "Prolong days," as in [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012).

[Deu 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#027)

Jehovah would scatter them among the nations, where they would perish
through want and suffering, and only a few (מספּר מתי, [Gen
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030)) would be left. "Whither" refers
to the nations whose land is thought of (cf. [Deu
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029); [Deu
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003)). For the thing intended, see
[Lev 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033), [Lev
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036), [Lev
26:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#038), and [Deu
28:64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064)., from which it is evident that
the author had not "the fate of the nation in the time of the Assyrians
in his mind" (Knobel), but rather all the dispersions which would come
upon the rebellious nation in future times, even down to the dispersion
under the Romans, which continues still; so that Moses contemplated the
punishment in its fullest extent.

[Deu 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#028)

There among the heathen they would be obliged to serve gods that were
the work of men's hands, gods of wood and stone, that could neither
hear, nor eat, nor smell, i.e., possessed no senses, showed no sign of
life. What Moses threatens here, follows from the eternal laws of the
divine government. The more refined idolatry of image-worship leads to
coarser and coarser forms, in which the whole nature of idol-worship is
manifested in all its pitiableness. "When once the God of revelation is
forsaken, the God of reason and imagination must also soon be given up
and make way for still lower powers, that perfectly accord with the I
exalted upon the throne, and in the time of pretended 'illumination' to
atheism and materialism also" (Schultz).

[Deu 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029)

From thence Israel would come to itself again in the time of deepest
misery, like the prodigal son in the gospel ([Luk
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017)), would seek the Lord its God,
and would also find Him if it sought with all its heart and soul (cf.
[Deu 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005); [Deu
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012)).

[Deu 4:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#030)

"In tribulation to thee (in thy trouble), all these things (the
threatened punishments and sufferings) will befall thee; at the end of
the days (see at [Gen 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001)) thou wilt
turn to Jehovah thy God, and hearken to His voice." With this
comprehensive thought Moses brings his picture of the future to a close.
(On the subject-matter, vid., [Lev
26:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039).) Returning to the Lord and
hearkening to His voice presuppose that the Lord will be found by those
who earnestly seek Him; "for ([Deu
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#031)) He is a merciful God, who does
not let His people go, nor destroy them, and who does not forget the
covenant with the fathers" (cf. [Lev
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#042) and [Lev
26:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#045)). הרפּה, to let loose, to
withdraw the hand from a person ([Jos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006)).

[Deuteronomy 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">deu 4:32</span></span>

But in order to accomplish something more than merely preserving the
people from apostasy by the threat of punishment, namely, to secure a
more faithful attachment and continued obedience to His commands by
awakening the feeling of cordial love, Moses reminds them again of the
glorious miracles of divine grace performed in connection with the
election and deliverance of Israel, such as had never been heard of from
the beginning of the world; and with this strong practical proof of the
love of the true God, he brings his first address to a close. This
closing thought in [Deu 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#032) is
connected by כּי (for) with the leading idea in [Deu
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#031). "Jehovah thy God is a merciful
God," to show that the sole ground for the election and redemption of
Israel was the compassion of God towards the human race. "For ask now of
the days that are past, from the day that God created man upon the
earth, and from one end of the heaven unto the other, whether so great a
thing has ever happened, or anything of the kind has been heard of:"
i.e., the history of all times since the creation of man, and of all
places under the whole heaven, can relate no such events as those which
have happened to Israel, viz., at Sinai ([Deu
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#033); cf. [Deu
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#012)). From this awfully glorious
manifestation of God, Moses goes back in [Deu
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034) to the miracles with which God
effected the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt. "Or has a god attempted
(made the attempt) to come and take to himself people from people (i.e.,
to fetch the people of Israel out of the midst of the Egyptian nation),
with temptations (the events in Egypt by which Pharaoh's relation to the
Lord was put to the test; cf. [Deu
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#022) and [Deu
7:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#018)), with signs and wonders (the
Egyptian plagues, see [Exo 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003)), and
with conflict (at the Red Sea: [Exo
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#014); [Exo
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003)), and with a strong hand and
outstretched arm (see [Exo 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006)), and
with great terrors?" In the three points mentioned last, all the acts of
God in Egypt are comprehended, according to both cause and effect. They
were revelations of the omnipotence of the Lord, and produced great
terrors (cf. [Exo 12:30-36](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#030)).

[Deuteronomy 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">deu 4:35</span></span>

Israel was made to see all this, that it might know that Jehovah was God
(האלהים, the God, to whom the name of elohim rightfully belonged), and
there was none else beside Him (cf. [Deu
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#039), [Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039); [Isa
45:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005)).

[Deuteronomy 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">deu 4:36</span></span>

But the Lord had spoken to Israel chiefly down from heaven (cf. [Exo
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#019) \[22\]), and that out of the
great fire, in which He had come down upon Sinai, to chastise it. יסּר
does not mean "to instruct the people with regard to His truth and
sovereignty," as Schultz thinks, but "to take them under holy
discipline" (Knobel), to inspire them with a salutary fear of the
holiness of His ways and of His judgments by the awful phenomena which
accompanied His descent, and shadowed forth the sublime and holy majesty
of His nature.

[Deuteronomy 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">deu 4:37</span></span>

All this He did from love to the fathers of Israel (the patriarchs):
"and indeed because He loved thy fathers, He chose his seed (the seed of
Abraham, the first of the patriarchs) after him, and brought thee
(Israel) out of Egypt by His face with great power, to drive out...and
to bring thee, to give thee their land...so that thou mightest know and
take to heart...and keep His laws," etc. With regard to the construction
of these verses, the clause כּי ותחת (and because) in [Deu
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037) is not to be regarded as
dependent upon what precedes, as Schultz supposes; nor are [Deu
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037) and [Deu
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#038) to be taken as the protasis, and
[Deu 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#039), [Deu
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040) as the apodosis (as Knobel
maintains). Both forms of construction are forced and unnatural. The
verses form an independent thought; and the most important point, which
was to bind Israel to faithfulness towards Jehovah, is given as the sum
and substance of the whole address, and placed as a protasis at the head
of the period. The only thing that admits of dispute, is whether the
apodosis commences with ויּבחר ("He chose," [Deu
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037)), or only with ויּוצאך ("brought
thee out"). Either is possible; and it makes no difference, so far as
the main thought is concerned, whether we regard the choice of Israel,
or simply the deliverance from Egypt, in which that choice was carried
into practical effect, as the consequence of the love of Jehovah to the
patriarchs. - The copula ו before תהת is specially emphatic, "and
truly," and indicates that the sum and substance of the whole discourse
is about to follow, or the one thought in which the whole appeal
culminates. It was the love of God to the fathers, not the righteousness
of Israel ([Deu 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#005)), which lay at the
foundation of the election of their posterity to be the nation of
Jehovah's possession, and also of all the miracles of grace which were
performed in connection with their deliverance out of Egypt. Moses
returns to this thought again at [Deu
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#015), for the purpose of impressing
it upon the minds of the people as the one motive which laid them under
the strongest obligation to circumcise the foreskin of their heart, and
walk in the fear and love of the Lord their God ([Deu
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012).). - The singular suffixes in
זרעו (his seed) and אחריו after him) refer to Abraham, whom Moses had
especially in his mind when speaking of "thy fathers," because he was
pre-eminently the lover of God ([Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008); [Ch2
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#007)), and also the beloved or friend
of God ([Jam 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023); cf. [Gen
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017).). "By His face" points back to
[Exo 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014). The face of Jehovah was
Jehovah in His personal presence, in His won person, who brought Israel
out of Egypt, to root out great and mighty nations before it, and give
it their land for an inheritance. "As this day" (clearly shows), viz.,
by the destruction of Sihon and Og, which gave to the Israelites a
practical pledge that the Canaanites in like manner would be rooted out
before them. The expression "as this day" does not imply, therefore,
that the Canaanites were already rooted out from their land.

[Deuteronomy 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">deu 4:39</span></span>

By this the Israelites were to know and lay it to heart, that Jehovah
alone was God in heaven and on earth, and were to keep His commandments,
in order that (אשׁר) it might be well with them and their descendants,
and they might have long life in Canaan. כּל־היּמים, "all time," for all
the future (cf. [Exo 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012)).

[Deuteronomy 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">deu 4:41</span></span>

Selection of Three Cities of Refuge for Unintentional Manslayers on the
East of the Jordan. - The account of this appointment of the cities of
refuge in the conquered land on the east of the Jordan is inserted
between the first and second addresses of Moses, in all probability for
no other reason than because Moses set apart the cities at that time
according to the command of God in [Num
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#006), [Num
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#014), not only to give the land on
that side its full consecration, and thoroughly confirm the possession
of the two Amoritish kingdoms on the other side of the Jordan, but also
to give the people in this punctual observance of the duty devolving
upon it an example for their imitation in the conscientious observance
of the commandments of the Lord, which he was now about to lay before
the nation. The assertion that this section neither stood after Num, nor
really belongs there, has a little foundation as the statement that its
contents are at variance with the precepts in Deut 19. "Toward the
sunrising" is introduced as a more precise definition; היּרדּן עבר, like
מזרחה in [Num 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#019) and [Num
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#015). On the contents of [Deu
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#042), comp. [Num
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#015). The three towns that were set
apart were Bezer, Ramoth, and Golan. "Bezer in the steppe, (namely) in
the land of the level" (The Amoritish table-land: [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010)). The situation of this Levitical
town and city of refuge, which is only mentioned again in [Jos
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008); [Jos
21:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#036), and [Ch1
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#063), has not yet been discovered.
Bezer was probably the same as Bosor (1 Macc. 5:36), and is possibly to
be seen in the Berza mentioned by Robinson (Pal. App. p. 170). Ramoth in
Gilead, i.e., Ramoth-Mizpeh (comp. [Jos
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008) with [Jos
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026)), was situated, according to the
Onom., fifteen Roman miles, or six hours, to the west of Philadelphia
(Rabbath-Ammon); probably, therefore, on the site of the modern Salt,
which is six hours' journey from Ammn (cf. v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 265,
266). - Golan, in Bashan, according to Eusebius (s. v. Gaulon or Golan),
was still a very large village in Batanaea even in his day, from which
the district generally received the name of Gaulonitis or Joan; but it
has not yet been discovered again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">deu 4:44</span></span>

Announcement of the Discourse upon the Law. - First of all, in [Deu
4:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#044), we have the general notice in
the form of a heading: "This is the Thorah which Moses set before the
children of Israel;" and then, in [Deu
4:45](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#045), [Deu
4:46](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#046), a fuller description of the
Thorah according to its leading features, "testimonies, statutes, and
rights" (see at [Deu 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001)), together
with a notice of the place and time at which Moses delivered this
address. "On their coming out of Egypt," i.e., not "after they had come
out," but during the march, before they had reached the goal of their
journeyings, viz., ([Deu 4:46](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#046)) when
they were still on the other side of the Jordan. "In the valley," as in
[Deu 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#029). "In the land of Sihon," and
therefore already upon ground which the Lord had given them for a
possession. The importance of this possession as the first-fruit and
pledge of the fulfilment of the further promises of God, led Moses to
mention again, though briefly, the defeat of the two kings of the
Amorites, together with the conquest of their land, just as he had done
before in [Deu 2:32-36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#032) and 3:1-17. On
[Deu 4:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#048), cf. [Deu
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009), [Deu
3:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012). Sion, for Hermon (see at [Deu
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009)).
