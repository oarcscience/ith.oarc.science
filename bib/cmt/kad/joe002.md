Summons to Penitential Prayer for the Removal of the Judgment - Joel
2:1-17

This section does not contain a fresh or second address of the prophet,
but simply forms the second part of his sermon of repentance, in which
he repeats with still greater emphasis the command already hinted at in
[Joe 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md), that there should be a
meeting of the congregation for humiliation and prayer, and assigns the
reason in a comprehensive picture of the approach of Jehovah's great and
terrible judgment-day ([Joe 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001).md),
coupled with the cheering assurance that the Lord will still take
compassion upon His people, according to His great grace, if they will
return to Him with all their heart ([Joe
2:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#012).md); and then closes with another
summons to the whole congregation to assemble for this purpose in the
house of the Lord, and with instructions how the priests are to pray to
the Lord ([Joe 2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015).md).

[Joel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 2:1</span></span>

By blowing the far-sounding horn, the priests are to make known to the
people the coming of the judgment, and to gather them together in the
temple to pray. [Joe 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md). "Blow ye the
trumpet upon Zion, and cause it to sound upon my holy mountain! All the
inhabitants of the land shall tremble; for the day of Jehovah cometh,
for it is near." That this summons is addressed to the priests, is
evident from [Joe 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md), compared with
[Joe 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014.md). On tiq‛ū shōphâr and
hârı̄‛ū, see at [Hos 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md). "Upon Zion,"
i.e., from the top of the temple mountain. Zion is called the holy
mountain, as in [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md), because the
Lord was there enthroned in His sanctuary, on the summit of Moriah,
which He claimed as His own. Râgaz, to tremble, i.e., to start up from
their careless state (Hitzig). On the expression, "for the day of
Jehovah cometh," see [Joe 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md). By the
position of בּוא at the head of the sentence, and that in the perfect
בּא instead of the imperfect, as in [Joe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md), the coming of the day of Jehovah
is represented as indisputably certain. The addition of kı̄ qârōbh (for
it is near) cannot be accounted for, however, from the fact that in the
spiritual intuition of the prophet this day had already come, whereas in
reality it was only drawing near (Hengstenberg); for such a separation
as this between one element of prophesying and another is inconceivable.
The explanation is simply, that the day of the Lord runs throughout the
history of the kingdom of God, so that it occurs in each particular
judgment: not, however, as fully manifested, but simply as being near or
approaching, so far as its complete fulfilment is concerned. Joel now
proclaims the coming of the day in its full completion, on the basis of
the judgment already experienced, as the approach of a terrible army of
locusts that darkens the land, at the head of which Jehovah is riding in
all the majesty of the Judge of the world. The description is divided
into three strophes thus: he first of all depicts the sight of this army
of God, as seen afar off, and its terrible appearance in general ([Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md) and [Joe
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#003).md); then the appearance and advance
of this mighty army ([Joe 2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#004).md); and
lastly, its irresistible power ([Joe
2:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#007).md); and closes the first strophe
with a figurative description of the devastation caused by this terrible
army, whilst in the second and third he gives prominence to the terror
which they cause among all nations, and over all the earth.

[Joel 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joe 2:2</span></span>

"A day of darkness and obscurity, a day of clouds and cloudy night: like
morning dawn spread over the mountains, a people great and strong: there
has not been the like from all eternity, nor will there be after it even
to the years of generation and generation. [Joe
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#003.md). Before it burneth fire, and
behind it flameth flame: the land before it as the garden of Eden, and
behind it like a desolate wilderness; and even that which escaped did
not remain to it." With four words, expressing the idea of darkness and
obscurity, the day of Jehovah is described as a day of the manifestation
of judgment. The words חשׁך ענן וערפל are applied in [Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011.md) to the cloudy darkness in which
Mount Sinai was enveloped, when Jehovah came down upon it in the fire;
and in [Exo 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#022.md), the darkness which
fell upon Egypt as the ninth plague is called אפלה. כּשׁחר וגו does not
belong to what precedes, nor does it mean blackness or twilight (as
Ewald and some Rabbins suppose), but "the morning dawn." The subject to
pârus (spread) is neither yōm (day), which precedes it, nor ‛am
(people), which follows; for neither of these yields a suitable thought
at all. The subject is left indefinite: "like morning dawn is it spread
over the mountains." The prophet's meaning is evident enough from what
follows. He clearly refers to the bright glimmer or splendour which is
seen in the sky as a swarm of locusts approaches, from the reflection of
the sun's rays from their wings.

(Note: The following is the account given by the Portuguese monk Francis
Alvarez, in his Journey through Abyssinia (Oedmann, Vermischte
Sammlungen, vi. p. 75): "The day before the arrival of the locusts we
could infer that they were coming, from a yellow reflection in the sky,
proceeding from their yellow wings. As soon as this light appeared, no
one had the slightest doubt that an enormous swarm of locusts was
approaching." He also says, that during his stay in the town of Barua he
himself saw this phenomenon, and that so vividly, that even the earth
had a yellow colour from the reflection. The next day a swarm of locusts
came.)

With עם רב ועצוּם (a people great and strong) we must consider the verb
בּא (cometh) in [Exo 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#001.md) as still
retaining its force. Yōm (day) and ‛âm (people) have the same predicate,
because the army of locusts carries away the day, and makes it into a
day of cloudy darkness. The darkening of the earth is mentioned in
connection with the Egyptian plague of locusts in [Exo
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#015.md), and is confirmed by many
witnesses (see the comm. on Ex. l.c.). The fire and the flame which go
both before and behind the great and strong people, viz., the locusts,
cannot be understood as referring to the brilliant light kindled as it
were by the morning dawn, which proceeds from the fiery armies of the
vengeance of God, i.e., the locusts (Umbreit), nor merely to the burning
heat of the drought by which everything is consumed ([Joe
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#019).md); but this burning heat is
heightened here into devouring flames of fire, which accompany the
appearing of God as He comes to judgment at the head of His army, after
the analogy of the fiery phenomena connected with the previous
manifestations of God, both in Egypt, where a terrible hail fell upon
the land before the plague of locusts, accompanied by thunder and balls
of fire ([Exo 9:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#023).md), and also at
Sinai, upon which the Lord came down amidst thunder and lightning, and
spoke to the people out of the fire ([Exo
19:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md); [Deu
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011).md). The land, which had
previously resembled the garden of paradise ([Gen
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008).md), was changed in consequence into
a desolate wilderness. פּליטה does not mean escape or deliverance,
either here or in [Oba 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017.md), but
simply that which has run away or escaped. Here it signifies that part
of the land which has escaped the devastation; for it is quite contrary
to the usage of the language to refer לו, as most commentators do, to
the swarm of locusts, from which there is no escape, no deliverance (cf.
[Sa2 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#014.md); [Jdg
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#017.md); [Ezr
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013.md), in all of which ל refers to the
subject, to which the thing that escaped was assigned). Consequently לו
can only refer to הארץ. The perfect היתה stands related to אחריו,
according to which the swarm of locusts had already completed the
devastation.

[Joel 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joe 2:4</span></span>

In [Joe 2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#004.md) we have a description of
this mighty army of God, and of the alarm caused by its appearance among
all nations. [Joe 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#004.md). "Like the
appearance of horses is its appearance; and like riding-horses, so do
they run. [Joe 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#005.md). Like rumbling of
chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the crackling
of flame which devours stubble, like a strong people equipped for
conflict. [Joe 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#006.md). Before it nations
tremble; all faces withdraw their redness." The comparison drawn between
the appearance of the locusts and that of horses refers chiefly to the
head, which, when closely examined, bears a strong resemblance to the
head of a horse, as Theodoret has already observed; a fact which gave
rise to their being called Heupferde (hay-horses) in German. In [Joe
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#004.md) the rapidity of their motion is
compared to the running of riding-horses (pârâshı̄m); and in [Joe
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#005.md) the noise caused by their
springing motion to the rattling of chariots, the small two-wheeled
war-chariots of the ancients, when driven rapidly over the rough
mountain roads. The noise caused by their devouring the plants and
shrubs is also compared to the burning of a flame over a stubble-field
that has been set on fire, and their approach to the advance of a war
force equipped for conflict. (Compare the adoption and further expansion
of these similes in [Rev 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#007.md), [Rev
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#009).md). At the sight of this terrible
army of God the nations tremble, so that their faces grow pale. ‛Ammı̄m
means neither people (see at [Kg1
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#028).md) nor the tribes of Israel, but
nations generally. Joel is no doubt depicting something more here than
the devastation caused by the locusts in his own day. There are
differences of opinion as to the rendering of the second hemistich,
which Nahum repeats in [Joe 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011.md). The
combination of פּארוּר with פּרוּר, a pot (Chald., Syr., Jer., Luth.,
and others), is untenable, since פּרוּר comes from פּרר, to break in
pieces, whereas פּארוּר (= פּארוּר) is from the root פאר, piel, to
adorn, beautify, or glorify; so that the rendering, "they gather
redness," i.e., glow with fear, which has an actual but not a
grammatical support in [Isa 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008.md), is
evidently worthless. We therefore understand פּארוּר, as Ab. Esr., Abul
Wal., and others have done, in the sense of elegantia, nitor,
pulchritudo, and as referring to the splendour or healthy ruddiness of
the cheeks, and take קבּץ ekat dn as an intensive form of קבץ, in the
sense of drawing into one's self, or withdrawing, inasmuch as fear and
anguish cause the blood to fly from the face and extremities to the
inward parts of the body. For the fact of the face turning pale with
terror, see [Jer 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#006.md).

[Joel 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joe 2:7</span></span>

In [Joe 2:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#007.md) the comparison of the
army of locusts to a well-equipped army is carried out still further;
and, in the first place, by a description of the irresistible force of
its advance. [Joe 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#007.md). "They run like
heroes, like warriors they climb the wall; every one goes on its way,
and they do not change their paths. [Joe
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#008.md). And they do not press one
another, they go every one in his path; and they fall headlong through
weapons, and do not cut themselves in pieces. [Joe
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#009.md). They run about in the city, they
run upon the wall, they climb into the houses, they come through the
windows like a thief." This description applies for the most part word
for word to the advance of the locusts, as Jerome (in loc.) and
Theodoret (on [Joe 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#008).md) attest from
their own observation.

(Note: Jerome says: "We saw (al. heard) this lately in the province
(Palestine). For when the swarms of locusts come and fill the whole
atmosphere between the earth and sky, they fly in such order, according
to the appointment of the commanding God, that they preserve an exact
shape, just like the squares drawn upon a tesselated pavement, not
diverging on either side by, so to speak, so much as a finger's breadth.
'And,' as he (the prophet) interprets the metaphor, 'through the windows
they will fall, and not be destroyed.' For there is no road impassable
to locusts; they penetrate into fields, and crops, and trees, and
cities, and houses, and even the recesses of the bed-chambers." And
Theodoret observes on [Joe 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#008.md): "For
you may see the grasshopper like a hostile army ascending the walls, and
advancing along the roads, and not suffering any difficulty to disperse
them, but steadily moving forward, as if according to some concerted
plan." And again, on [Joe 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#009.md) : "And
this we have frequently seen done, not merely by hostile armies, but
also by locusts, which not only when flying, but by creeping along the
walls, pass through the windows into the houses themselves.")

They run like heroes - namely, to the assault: רוּץ referring to an
attack, as in [Job 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#026.md) and [Psa
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#030.md), "as their nimbleness has
already been noticed in [Joe 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#004.md)"
(Hitzig). Their climbing the walls also points to an assault. Their
irresistible march to the object of their attack is the next point
described. No one comes in another's way; they do not twist (עבט) their
path, i.e., do not diverge either to the right hand or to the left, so
as to hinder one another. Even the force of arms cannot stop their
advance. שׁלח is not a missile, telum, missile (Ges. and others), but a
weapon extended or held in front (Hitzig); and the word is not only
applied to a sword ([Ch2 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#010.md); [Neh
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#011).md), but to weapons of defence ([Ch2
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005).md). בּצע, not "to wound themselves"
(= פּצע), but "to cut in pieces," used here intransitively, to cut
themselves in pieces. This does no doubt transcend the nature even of
the locust; but it may be explained on the ground that they are
represented as an invincible army of God.

(Note: The notion that these words refer to attempts to drive away the
locusts by force of arms, in support of which Hitzig appeals to Liv.
hist. xlii. 10, Plinii hist. n. xi. 29, and Hasselquist, Reise nach Pal.
p. 225, is altogether inappropriate. All that Livy does is to speak of
ingenti agmine hominum ad colligendas eas (locustas) coacto; and Pliny
merely says, Necare et in Syria militari imperio coguntur. And although
Hasselquist says, Both in Asia and Europe they sometimes take the field
against the locusts with all the equipments of war," this statement is
decidedly false so far as Europe is concerned. In Bessarabia (according
to the accounts of eye-witnesses) they are merely in the habit of
scaring away the swarms of locusts that come in clouds, by making a
great noise with drums, kettles, hay-forks, and other noisy instruments,
for the purpose of preventing them from settling on the ground, and so
driving them further. Hass's account of a pasha of Tripoli having sent
4000 soldiers against the insects only a few years ago, is far too
indefinite to prove that they were driven away by the force of arms.)

On the other hand, the words of [Joe
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#009.md) apply, so far as the first half is
concerned, both to the locusts and to an army (cf. [Isa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004.md); [Nah
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#005).md); whereas the second half applies
only to the former, of which Theodoret relates in the passage quoted
just now, that he has frequently seen this occur (compare also [Exo
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#006).md).

[Joel 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joe 2:10</span></span>

The whole universe trembles at this judgment of God. [Joe
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010.md). "Before it the earth quakes, the
heavens tremble: sun and moon have turned black, and the stars have
withdrawn their shining. [Joe 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011.md).
And Jehovah thunders before His army, for His camp is very great, for
the executor of His word is strong; for the day of Jehovah is great and
very terrible, and who can endure it?" The remark of Jerome on [Joe
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010.md), viz., that "it is not that the
strength of the locusts is so great that they can move the heavens and
shake the earth, but that to those who suffer from such calamities, from
the amount of their own terror, the heavens appear to shake and the
earth to reel," is correct enough so far as the first part is concerned,
but it by no means exhausts the force of the words. For, as Hitzig
properly observes, the earth could only quake because of the locusts
when they had settled, and the heavens could only tremble and be
darkened when they were flying, so that the words would in any case be
very much exaggerated. But it by no means follows from this, that לפניו
is not to be taken as referring to the locusts, like מפּניו in [Joe
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#006.md), but to the coming of Jehovah in a
storm, and that it is to be understood in this sense: "the earth quakes,
the air roars at the voice of Jehovah, i.e., at the thunder, and
storm-clouds darken the day." For although nâthan qōlō (shall utter His
voice) in [Joe 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011.md) is to be
understood as referring to the thunder, Joel is not merely describing a
storm, which came when the trouble had reached its height and put an end
to the plague of locusts (Credner, Hitzig, and others). לפניו cannot be
taken in any other sense than that in which it occurs in [Joe
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#003.md); that is to say, it can only refer
to "the great people and strong," viz., the army of locusts, like
מפּניו. Heaven and earth tremble at the army of locusts, because Jehovah
comes with them to judge the world (cf. [Isa
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#013.md); [Nah
1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005.md); [Jer
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010).md). The sun and moon become black,
i.e., dark, and the stars withdraw their brightness ('âsaph, withdraw,
as in [Sa1 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019).md), i.e., they let
their light shine no more. That these words affirm something infinitely
greater than the darkening of the lights of heaven by storm-clouds, is
evident partly from the predictions of the judgment of the wrath of the
Lord that is coming upon the whole earth and upon the imperial power
([Isa 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010.md); [Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007).md), at which the whole fabric of
the universe trembles and nature clothes itself in mourning, and partly
from the adoption of this particular feature by Christ in His
description of the last judgment ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md); [Mar
13:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024).md). Compare, on the other hand,
the poetical description of a storm in [Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md)., where this feature is wanting.
(For further remarks, see at [Joe
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004)..md) At the head of the army which is
to execute His will, the Lord causes His voice of thunder to sound
(nâthan qōl, to thunder; cf. [Psa
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014), etc..md). The reason for this is
given in three sentences that are introduced by kı̄. Jehovah does this
because His army is very great; because this powerful army executes His
word, i.e., His command; and because the day of judgment is so great and
terrible, that no one can endure it, i.e., no one can stand before the
fury of the wrath of the Judge (cf. [Jer
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010.md); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md).

[Joel 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joe 2:12</span></span>

But there is still time to avert the completion of the judgment by
sincere repentance and mourning; for God is merciful, and ready to
forgive the penitent. [Joe 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#012.md). "Yet
even now, is the saying of Jehovah, turn ye to me with all your heart,
and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning. [Joe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md). And rend your heart and not your
garments, and turn back to Jehovah your God; for He is gracious and
merciful, long-suffering, and great in kindness, and suffers Himself to
repent of the evil. [Joe 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014.md). Who
knoweth He turns and repents, and leaves behind Him blessing,
meat-offering and drink-offering for Jehovah your God?" As the plague of
locusts was intended to bring the people to reflect upon their conduct
towards the Lord, so was the announcement of the great day of judgment
and all its terrors made with no other object than to produce repentance
and conversion, and thereby promote the good of the people of God. Joel
therefore appends to the threatening of judgment a summons to sincere
conversion to the Lord; and this he does by first of all addressing the
summons to the people as a saying of Jehovah (v. 12), and then
explaining this word of God in the most emphatic manner (vv. 13, 14).
The Lord God requires conversion to Himself with all the heart (cf. [Sa1
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#003.md), and [Deu
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005.md); and for שׂוּב עד, [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002).md), associated with deep-rooted
penitence on account of sin, which is to be outwardly manifested in
fasting and mourning. But lest the people should content themselves with
the outward signs of mourning, he proceeds in [Joe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md) with the warning admonition,
"Rend your heart, and not your garments." Rending the heart signifies
contrition of heart (cf. [Psa 51:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019.md);
[Eze 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026).md). He then assigns the
motive for this demand, by pointing to the mercy and grace of God, in
the words of [Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md), with which the
Lord made known to Moses His inmost nature, except that in the place of
ואמת, which we find in this passage, he adds, on the ground of the facts
recorded in [Eze 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014.md) and [Sa2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md), ונחם על הרעה. On the strength
of these facts he hopes, even in the present instance, for forgiveness
on the part of God, and the removal of the judgment. "Who knoweth?"
equivalent to "perhaps;" not because "too confident a hope would have
had in it something offensive to Jehovah" (Hitzig), but "lest perchance
they might either despair on account of the magnitude of their crimes,
or the greatness of the divine clemency might make them careless"
(Jerome).

(Note: "He speaks after the manner of a terrified conscience, which is
lifted up again with difficulty after a season of affliction, and begins
to aspire after hope and the mercy of God. Moreover, the expression 'who
knoweth' is a Hebrew phrase, which does not indicate doubt, but rather
affirmation, coupled with desire, as if we were to say, 'And yet surely
God will turn again.'" - Luther, Enarrat. in Joelem, Opp., Jena 1703, p.
iii.)

ישׁוּב, to turn, sc. from coming to judgment. נהם as in [Joe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md). השׁאיר אחריו, to leave behind
Him, sc. when He returns to His throne in heaven ([Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015).md). Berâkhâh, a blessing, viz.,
harvest-produce for a meat-offering and drink-offering, which had been
destroyed by the locusts ([Joe 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009.md),
[Joe 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013).md).

[Joel 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joe 2:15</span></span>

To make this admonition still more emphatic, the prophet concludes by
repeating the appeal for the appointment of a meeting in the temple for
prayer, and even gives the litany in which the priests are to offer
their supplication. [Joe 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md). "Blow
ye the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, proclaim a meeting. [Joe
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#016.md). Gather the people together,
sanctify an assembly, bring together the old men, gather together the
children and sucklings at the breasts. Let the bridegroom go out of his
chamber, and the bride out of her room. [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017.md). Between the porch and the altar
are the priests, the servants of Jehovah, to weep and say, Spare, O
Jehovah, Thy people, and give not up Thine inheritance to shame, so that
the heathen scoff at them. Wherefore should men say among the nations,
Where is their God?" [Joe 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md) is a
literal repetition from [Joe 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md) and
[Joe 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md); [Joe
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#016.md) a more detailed expansion of [Joe
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md), in which, first of all, the
people generally (עם) are mentioned, and then the objection of the
summons explained in the words קדּשׁוּ קהל, "Call a holy meeting of the
congregation." But in order that none may think themselves exempt, the
people are more precisely defined as old men, children, and sucklings.
Even the bride and bridegroom are to give up the delight of their
hearts, and take part in the penitential and mournful worship. No age,
no rank, is to stay away, because no one, not even the suckling, is free
from sin; but all, without exception, are exposed to the judgment. "A
stronger proof of the deep and universal guilt of the whole nation could
not be found, than that on the great day of penitence and prayer, even
new-born infants were to be carried in their arms" (Umbreit). The
penitential supplication of the whole nation is to be brought before the
Lord by the priests as the mediators of the nation. יבכּוּ in [Joe
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#017.md) is jussive, like יצא in [Joe
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#016.md), though Hitzig disputes this, but
on insufficient grounds. The allusion to the priests in the former could
only be unsuitable, if they were merely commanded to go to the temple
like the rest of the people. But it is not to this that [Joe
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#017.md) refers, but to the performance of
their official duty, when the people had assembled for the penitential
festival. They were to stand between the porch of the temple and the
altar of burnt-offering, i.e., immediately in front of the door of the
holy place, and there with tears entreat the Lord, who was enthroned in
the sanctuary, not to give up the people of His possession (nachălâh as
in [Kg1 8:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#051.md); cf. [Deu
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md); [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009).md) to the reproach of being scoffed
at by the heathen. למשׁל־בּם גּוים is rendered by Luther and others,
"that heathen rule over them," after the ancient versions; and [Psa
106:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#041.md); [Deu
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#006.md), and [Lam
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#008.md), might be appealed to in support
of this rendering. But although grammatically allowable, it is not
required by the parallelism, as Hengstenberg maintains. For even if the
reproach of Israel could consist in the fact that they, the inheritance
of the Lord, were subjected to the government of heathen, this thought
is very remote from the idea of the passage before us, where there is no
reference at all in the threatening of punishment to subjection to the
heathen, but simply to the devastation of the land. משׁל with ב also
signifies to utter a proverb (= to scoff) at any one, for which Ezekiel
indeed makes use of משׁל משׁל ([Eze
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#002.md); [Eze
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002.md), and in [Eze
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#023.md) and [Eze
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#003) construed with ב.md); but it is
evident that mâshal was sometimes used alone in this sense, from the
occurrence of mōshelı̄m in [Num 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027.md)
as a term applied to the inventors of proverbs, and also of meshōl as a
proverb or byword in [Job 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006.md),
whether we take the word as an infinitive or a substantive. This
meaning, as Marck observes, is rendered probable both by the connection
with חרפּה, and also by the parallel clause which follows, viz.,
"Wherefore should men among the heathen say," etc., more especially if
we reflect that Joel had in his mind not [Deu
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#006.md), which has nothing in common with
the passage before us except the verb mâshal, but rather [Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037.md), where Moses not only threatens
the people with transportation to another land for their apostasy from
the Lord, and that they shall become "an astonishment, a proverb
(mâshâl), and a byword" among all nations, but ([Deu
28:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#038.md), [Deu
28:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#040).md) also threatens them with the
devastation of their seed-crops, their vineyards, and their
olive-grounds by locusts. Compare also [Kg1
9:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#007.md), where not only the casting out
of Israel among the heathen, but even the destruction of the temple, is
mentioned as the object of ridicule on the part of the heathen; also the
combination of לחרפּה and למשׁל in [Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md). But [Joe
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md) is decisive in favour of this
view of למשׁל בם ג. The Lord there promises that He will send His people
corn, new wine, and oil, to their complete satisfaction, and no longer
make them a reproach among the nations; so that, according to this, it
was not subjugation or transportation by heathen foes that gave occasion
to the scoffing of the nations at Israel, but the destruction of the
harvest by the locusts. The saying among the nations, "Where is their
God?" is unquestionably a sneer at the covenant relation of Jehovah to
Israel; and to this Jehovah could offer no inducement, since the
reproach would fall back upon Himself. Compare for the fact itself, [Exo
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012.md); [Mic
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010.md), and [Psa
115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002.md). Thus the prayer closes with the
strongest reason why God should avert the judgment, and one that could
not die away without effect.

[Joel 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joe 2:18</span></span>

[Joe 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018.md) and [Joe
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md) contain the historical statement,
that in consequence of the penitential prayer of the priests, the Lord
displayed His mercy to His people, and gave them a promise, the first
part of which follows in [Joe 2:19-27](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md).
[Joe 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018.md), [Joe
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md). "Then Jehovah was jealous for
His land, and had compassion upon His people. And Jehovah answered, and
said." The grammar requires that we should take the imperfects with Vav
consec. in these clauses, as statements of what actually occurred. The
passages in which imperfects with Vav cons. are either really or
apparently used in a prophetic announcement of the future, are of a
different kind; e.g., in [Joe 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023.md),
where we find one in a subordinate clause preceded by perfects. As the
verb ויּען describes the promise which follows, as an answer given by
Jehovah to His people, we must assume that the priests had really
offered the penitential and supplicatory prayer to which the prophet had
summoned them in [Joe 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017.md). The
circumstance that this is not expressly mentioned, neither warrants us
in rendering the verbs in [Joe 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017.md) in
the present, and taking them as statements of what the priest really did
(Hitzig), nor in changing the historical tenses in [Joe
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018.md), [Joe
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md) into futures. We have rather
simply to supply the execution of the prophet's command between [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017.md) and [Joe
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018.md). קנּא with ל, to be jealous for a
person, i.e., to show the jealousy of love towards him, as in [Exo
39:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#025.md); [Zac
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014.md) (see at [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).md). חמל as in [Exo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006.md); [Sa1
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#021.md). In the answer from Jehovah
which follows, the three features in the promise are not given according
to their chronological order; but in order to add force to the
description, we have first of all, in [Joe
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md), a promise of the relief of the
distress at which both man and beast had sighed, and then, in [Joe
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020.md), a promise of the destruction of
the devastator; and it is not till [Joe
2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#021.md) that the third feature is
mentioned in the further development of the promise, viz., the teacher
for righteousness. Then finally, in [Joe
2:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023.md), the fertilizing fall of rain,
and the plentiful supply of the fruits of the ground that had been
destroyed by the locusts, are more elaborately described, as the first
blessing bestowed upon the people.

[Joel 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joe 2:19</span></span>

The promise runs as follows. [Joe
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md). "Behold, I send you the corn,
and the new wine, and the oil, that ye may become satisfied therewith;
and will no more make you a reproach among the nations. [Joe
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020.md). And I will remove the northern
one far away from you, and drive him into the land of drought and
desert; its van into the front sea, and its rear into the hinder sea:
and its stink will ascend, and its corruption ascend, for it has done
great things." The Lord promises, first of all, a compensation for the
injury done by the devastation, and then the destruction of the
devastation itself, so that it may do no further damage. [Joe
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md) stands related to [Joe
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#011.md). Shâlach, to send: the corn is
said to be sent instead of given ([Hos
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#010).md), because God sends the rain
which causes the corn to grow. Israel shall no longer be a reproach
among the nations, "as a poor people, whose God is unable to assist it,
or has evidently forsaken it" (Ros.). Marck and Schmieder have already
observed that this promise is related to the prayer, that He would not
give up His inheritance to the reproach of the scoffings of the heathen
([Joe 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#017.md) : see the comm. on this
verse). הצּפוני, the northern one, as an epithet applied to the swarm of
locusts, furnishes no decisive argument in favour of the allegorical
interpretation of the plague of locusts. For even if locusts generally
come to Palestine from the south, out of the Arabian desert, the remark
out of the Arabian desert, the remark made by Jerome, to the effect that
"the swarms of locusts are more generally brought by the south wind than
by the north," shows that the rule is not without its exceptions.
"Locusts come and go with all winds" (Oedmann, ii. p. 97). In Arabia,
Niebuhr (Beschreib. p. 169) saw swarms of locusts come from south, west,
north, and east. Their home is not confined to the desert of Arabia, but
they are found in all the sandy deserts, which form the southern
boundaries of the lands that were, and to some extent still are, the
seat of cultivation, viz., in the Sahara, the Libyan desert, Arabia, and
Irak (Credner, p. 285); and Niebuhr (l.c.) saw a large tract of land, on
the road from Mosul to Nisibis, completely covered with young locusts.
They are also met with in the Syrian desert, from which swarms could
easily be driven to Palestine by a north-east wind, without having to
fly across the mountains of Lebanon. Such a swarm as this might be
called the tsephōnı̄, i.e., the northern one, or northerner, even if the
north was not its true home. For it cannot be philologically proved that
tsephōnı̄ can only denote one whose home is in the north. Such
explanations as the Typhonian, the barbarian, and others, which we meet
with in Hitzig, Ewald, and Meier, and which are obtained by alterations
of the text or far-fetched etymologies, must be rejected as arbitrary.
That which came from the north shall also be driven away by the north
wind, viz., the great mass into the dry and desert land, i.e., the
desert of Arabia, the van into the front (or eastern) sea, i.e., the
Dead Sea ([Eze 47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md); [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008).md), the rear into the hinder (or
western) sea, i.e., the Mediterranean (cf. [Deu
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024).md). This is, of course, not to be
understood as signifying that the dispersion was to take place in all
these three directions at one and the same moment, in which case three
different winds would blow at the same time; but it is a rhetorical
picture of rapid and total destruction, which is founded upon the idea
that the wind rises in the north-west, then turns to the north, and
finally to the north-east, so that the van of the swarm is driven into
the eastern sea, the great mass into the southern desert, and the rear
into the western sea. The explanation given by Hitzig and others -
namely, that pânı̄m signifies the eastern border, and sōph the western
border of the swarm, which covered the entire breadth of the land, and
was driven from north to south - cannot be sustained. Joel mentions both
the van and the rear after the main body, simply because they both meet
with the same fate, both falling into the sea and perishing there;
whereupon the dead bodies are thrown up by the waves upon the shore,
where their putrefaction fills the air with stench. The perishing of
locusts in seas and lakes is attested by many authorities.

(Note: Even Pliny says (h. n. xi. 29), Gregatim sublato vento in maria
aut stagna decidunt; and Jerome has the following remarks on this verse:
"Even in our own times we have seen the land of Judaea covered by swarms
of locusts, which, as soon as the wind rose, were precipitated into the
first and latest seas, i.e., the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean. And
when the shores of both seas were filled with heaps of dead locusts,
which the waters had thrown up, their corruption and stench became so
noxious, that even the atmosphere was corrupted, and both man and beasts
suffered from the consequent pestilence.")

For עלה באשׁו, compare [Isa 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#003.md) and
[Amo 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#010.md). צחנה is ἁπ. λεγ.; but the
meaning corruption is sustained partly by the parallelism, and partly by
the Syriac verb, which means to be dirty. The army of locusts had
deserved this destruction, because it had done great things. הגדּיל
לעשׂות, to do great things, is affirmed of men or other creatures, with
the subordinate idea of haughtiness; so that it not only means he has
done a mighty thing, accomplished a mighty devastation, but is used in
the same sense as the German grosstun, via. to brag or be proud of one
strength. It does not follow from this, however, that the locusts are
simply figurative, and represent hostile nations. For however true it
may be that sin and punishment presuppose accountability (Hengst.,
Hvernick), and conclusion drawn from this - namely, that they cannot be
imputed to irrational creatures - is incorrect. The very opposite is
taught by the Mosaic law, according to which God will punish every act
of violence done by beasts upon man ([Gen
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005).md), whilst the ox which killed a man
was commanded to be stoned ([Exo
21:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#028).md).

[Joel 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joe 2:21</span></span>

This promise is carried out still further in what follows; and Joel
summons the earth ([Joe 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#021).md), the
beasts of the field ([Joe 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#022).md), and
the sons of Zion ([Joe 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023).md) to joy
and exultation at this mighty act of the Lord, by which they have been
delivered from the threatening destruction. [Joe
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#021.md). "Fear not, O earth! exult and
rejoice: for Jehovah doeth great things! [Joe
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#022.md). Fear ye not, O beasts of the
field! for the pastures of the desert become green, for the tree bears
its fruit; fig-tree and vine yield their strength. [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023.md). And ye sons of Zion, exult and
rejoice in the Lord your God; for He giveth you the teacher for
righteousness, and causes to come down to you a rain-fall, early rain
and latter rain, first of all." The soil had suffered from the drought
connected with the swarms of locusts ([Joe
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009).md); the beasts of the field had
groaned on account of the destruction of all the plants and vegetation
of every kind ([Joe 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#018).md); the men had
sighed over the unparalleled calamity that had befallen both land and
people. The prophet here calls to all of them not to fear, but to exult
and rejoice, and gives in every case an appropriate reason for the call.
In that of the earth, he introduces the thought that Jehovah had done
great things - had destroyed the foe that did great things; in that of
the beasts, he points to the fresh verdure of the pastures, and the
growth of the fruit upon the trees; in that of men, he lays stress upon
a double fact, viz., the gift of a teacher for righteousness, and the
pouring out of a plentiful rain. In this description we have to notice
the rhetorical individualizing, which forms its peculiar characteristic,
and serves to explain not only the distinction between the earth, the
beasts of the field, and the sons of Zion, but the distribution of the
divine blessings among the different members of the creation that are
mentioned here. For, so far as the fact itself is concerned, the
threefold blessing from God benefits all three classes of the earthly
creation: the rain does good not only to the sons of Zion, or to men,
but also to animals and to the soil; and so again do the green of the
pastures and the fruits of the trees; and lastly, even the הגדּיל יי
לעשׂות not only blesses the earth, but also the beasts and men upon it.
It is only through overlooking this rhetorico-poetical distribution,
that any one could infer from [Joe
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#022.md), that because the fruits are
mentioned here as the ordinary food of animals, in direct contrast to
[Gen 1:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028.md), where the fruit of the
trees is assigned to men for food, the beasts of the field signify the
heathen. The perfects in the explanatory clauses of these three verses
are all to be taken alike, and not to be rendered in the preterite in
[Joe 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#021.md), and in the present in [Joe
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#022.md) and [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023.md). The perfect is not only applied
to actions, which the speaker looks upon from his own standpoint as
actually completed, as having taken place, or as things belonging to the
past, but to actions which the will or the lively fancy of the speaker
regards as being as good as completed, in other words, assumes as
altogether unconditional and certain, and to which in modern languages
we should apply the present (Ewald, 135, a, etc.). The latter is the
sense in which it is used here, since the prophet sets forth the divine
promise as a fact, which is unquestionably certain and complete, even
though its historical realization has only just begun, and extends into
the nearer or more remote future. The divine act over which the prophet
calls upon them to rejoice, is not to be restricted to the destruction
of those swarms of locusts that had at that time invaded Judah, and the
revivification of drying nature, but is an act of God that is being
constantly repeated whenever the same circumstances occur, or whose
influence continues as long as this earth lasts; since it is a tangible
pledge, that to all eternity, as is stated in [Joe
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#026.md), [Joe
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#027.md), the people of the Lord will not
be put to shame. The "sons of Zion" are not merely the inhabitants of
Zion itself, but the dwellers in the capital are simply mentioned as the
representatives of the kingdom of Judah. As the plague of locusts fell
not upon Jerusalem only, but upon the whole land, the call to rejoicing
must refer to all the inhabitants of the land ([Joe
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002.md), [Joe
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014).md). They are to rejoice in Jehovah,
who has proved Himself to be their God by the removal of the judgment
and the bestowal of a fresh blessing.

This blessing is twofold in its nature. He gives them את־המּורה לצדקה.
From time immemorial there has been a diversity of opinion as to the
meaning of these words. Most of the Rabbins and earlier commentators
have followed the Chaldee and Vulgate, and taken mōreh in the sense of
"teacher;" but others, in no small number, have taken it in the sense of
"early rain," e.g., Ab. Ezra, Kimchi, Tanch., Calvin, and most of the
Calvinistic and modern commentators. But although mōreh is
unquestionably used in the last clause of this verse in the sense of
early rain; in every other instance this is called yōreh ([Deu
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014.md); [Jer
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024).md); for [Psa
84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007.md) cannot be brought into the
account since the meaning is disputed. Consequently the conjecture is a
very natural one, that in the last clause of the verse Joel selected the
form mōreh, instead of yōreh, to signify early rain, simply on account
of the previous occurrence of hammōreh in the sense of "teacher," and
for the sake of the unison. This rendering of hammōreh is not only
favoured by thee article placed before it, since neither mōreh = yōreh
(early rain), nor the corresponding and tolerably frequent malqōsh
(latter rain), ever has the article, and no reason can be discovered why
mōreh should be defined by the article here if it signified early rain;
but it is decisively confirmed by the following word לצדקה, which is
quite inapplicable to early rain, since it cannot mean either "in just
measure," or "at the proper time," or "in becoming manner," as tsedâqâh
is only used in the ethical sense of righteousness, and is never met
with sensu physico, neither in [Sa2
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#029.md); [Neh
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#020.md), nor in [Psa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003.md) and [Lev
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036.md), where moreover צדק occurs. For
מעגּלי צדק (in the Psalm) are not straight or right ways, but ways of
righteousness (spiritual ways); and although מאזני צדק, אבני צדק, are no
doubt really correct scales and weight-stones, this is simply because
they correspond to what is ethically right, so that we cannot deduce
from this the idea of correct measure in the case of the rain. Ewald and
Umbreit, who both of them recognise the impossibility of proving that
tsedâqâh is used in the physical sense of correctness or correct
measure, have therefore adopted the rendering "rain for justification,"
or "for righteousness;" Ewald regarding the rain as a sign that they are
adopted again into the righteousness of God, whilst Umbreit takes it as
a manifestation of eternal righteousness in the flowing stream of
fertilizing grace. But apart from the question, whether these thoughts
are in accordance with the doctrine of Scripture, they are by no means
applicable here, where the people have neither doubted the revelation of
the righteousness of God, nor prayed to God for justification, but have
rather appealed to the compassion and grace of God in the consciousness
of their sin and guilt, and prayed to be spared and rescued from
destruction ([Joe 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md), [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017).md). By the "teacher for
righteousness," we are to understand neither the prophet Joel only (v.
Hofmann), nor the Messiah directly (Abarbanel), nor the idea teacher or
collective body of messengers from God (Hengstenberg), although there is
some truth at the foundation of all these suppositions. The direct or
exclusive reference to the Messiah is at variance wit the context, since
all the explanatory clauses in vv. 21-23 treat of blessings or gifts of
God, which were bestowed at any rate partially at that particular time.
Moreover, in v. 23, the sending of the rain-fall is represented by
ויּורד (imperf. c. Vav cons.), if not as the consequence of the sending
of the teacher for righteousness, at any rate as a contemporaneous
event. These circumstances apparently favour the application of the
expression to the prophet Joel. Nevertheless, it is by no means probable
that Joel describes himself directly as the teacher for righteousness,
or speaks of his being sent to the people as the object of exultation.
No doubt he had induced the people to turn to the Lord, and to offer
penitential supplication for His mercy through his call to repentance,
and thereby effected the consequent return of rain and fruitful seasons;
but his address and summons would not have had this result, if the
people had not been already instructed by Moses, by the priests, and by
other prophets before himself, concerning the ways of the Lord. All of
these were teachers for righteousness, and are included under hammōreh.
Still we must not stop at them. As the blessings of grace, at the
reception of which the people were to rejoice, did not merely consist,
as we have just observed, in the blessings which came to it at that
time, or in Joel's days, but also embraced those which were continually
bestowed upon it by the Lord; we must not exclude the reference to the
Messiah, to whom Moses had already pointed as the prophet whom the Lord
would raise up unto them, and to whom they were to hearken ([Deu
18:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018).md), but must rather regard the
sending of the Messiah as the final fulfilment of this promise. This
view answers to the context, if we simply notice that Joel mentions here
both the spiritual and material blessings which the Lord is conveying to
His people, and then in what follows expounds the material blessings
still further in [Joe 2:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023.md), and the
spiritual blessings in [Joe 2:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md)
and ch. 3. They are both of them consequences of the gift of the teacher
for righteousness.

Hence the expansion of the earthly saving gifts is attached by ויּורד
with Vav cons. Joel mentions first of all geshem, a rain-fall, or
plentiful rain for the fertilizing of the soil and then defines it more
exactly as early rain, which fell in the autumn at the sowing time and
promoted the germination and growth of the seed, and latter rain, which
occurred in the spring shortly before the time of harvest and brought
the crops to maturity (see at [Lev
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003).md). בּראשׁון, in the beginning,
i.e., first (= ראשׂנה in [Gen 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#002.md),
just as כּראשׁון is used in [Lev 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#015.md)
for בּראשׂנה in [Num 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#013).md), not in
the first month (Chald., etc.), or in the place of כּבראשׂנה, as before
(lxx, Vulg., and others). For בּראשׁון corresponds to אחרי־כן in [Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md) ([Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001).md), as Ewald, Meier, and
Hengstenberg admit. First of all the pouring out of a plentiful rain (an
individualizing expression for all kinds of earthly blessings, chosen
here with reference to the opposite of blessing occasioned by the
drought); and after that, the pouring out of the spiritual blessing
(Joel 2:28-3:21).

[Joel 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joe 2:24</span></span>

Effects of the rain. [Joe 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#024.md). "And
the barns become full of corn, and the vats flow over with new wine and
oil. [Joe 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#025.md). And I repay to you the
years which the locust has eaten, the licker, and the devourer, and the
gnawer, my great army which I sent among you. [Joe
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#026.md). And ye will eat, eat and be
satisfied, and praise the name of Jehovah your God, who hath done
wondrously with you; and my people shall not be put to shame to all
eternity. [Joe 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#027.md). And ye will know
that I am in the midst of Israel, and I (am) Jehovah your God, and none
else, and my people shall not be put to shame to all eternity." [Joe
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#024.md) is practically the same as [Joe
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md), and the counterpart to [Joe
1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010.md). השׁיק from שׁוּק, to run,
hiphil only here and [Joe 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013.md), to run
over, to overflow; pilel, [Psa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010.md),
shōqēq, to cause to overflow. יקבים, the vats of the wine-presses, into
which the wine flows when trodden out; here it also applies to the vats
of the oil-presses, into which the oil ran as it was pressed out.
Through these bountiful harvests God would repay to the people the
years, i.e., the produce of the years, which the locusts ate. The
plural, shânı̄m, furnishes no certain proof that Joel referred in ch. 1
to swarms of locusts of several successive years; but is used either
with indefinite generality, as in [Gen
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007.md), or with a distinct significance,
viz., as a poetical expression denoting the greatness and violence of
the devastation. On the different names of the locusts, see at [Joe
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md). It is to be observed here that
the copula stands before the last two names, but not before yeleq, so
that the last three names belong to one another as co-ordinates
(Hitzig), i.e., they are merely different epithets used for 'arbeh, the
locusts.

[Joel 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joe 2:26</span></span>

On the reception of these benefits the people will praise the Lord, who
has shown it such wondrous grace, lit., has acted towards it even to the
doing of wonders.

[Joel 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joe 2:27</span></span>

They will learn thereby that Jehovah is present among His people, and
the only true God, who does not suffer His people to be put to shame.
The repetition of ולא יבשׁוּ וגו, by which the promised grace is
guaranteed to the people for all ages, serves as a rhetorical rounding
off of the section (see at [Joe 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020).md).

[Joel 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joe 2:28</span></span>

(Heb. ch. 3). Outpouring of the Spirit of God, and Announcement of
Judgment.

(Note: Among other special expositions of these verses, see
Hengstenberg's Christology, vol. i. p. 326ff. translation.)

[Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md). "And it will come to pass
afterwards, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and
your daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, and your
young men see visions. [Joe 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#029.md). And
also upon the men-servants and maid-servants I will put out my Spirit in
those days." As 'achărē-khēn points back to bâri'shōn in [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023.md), the formula vehâyâh achărē-khēn
describes the outpouring of the Spirit as a second and later consequence
of the gift of the teacher for righteousness. שׁפך, to pour out,
signifies communication in rich abundance, like a rain-fall or
water-fall. For the communication of the Spirit of God was not entirely
wanting to the covenant nation from the very first. In fact, the Spirit
of God was the only inward bond between the Lord and His people; but it
was confined to the few whom God endowed as prophets with the gift of
His Spirit. This limitation was to cease in the future.

(Note: "There is no doubt that the prophet promises something greater
here than the fathers had experienced under the law. We know that the
grace of the Holy Spirit flourished even among the ancient people; but
the prophet promises here not what the faithful had formerly
experienced, but something greater. And this may be gathered from the
verb 'to pour' which he employs. For שׁפך does not mean merely to give
in drops, but to pour out in great abundance. But God did not pour out
the Holy Spirit so abundantly or copiously under the law, as He has
since the manifestation of Christ." - Calvin.)

What Moses expressed as a wish - namely, that the people were all
prophets, and the Lord would put His Spirit upon them ([Num
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#029).md) - was to be fulfilled in the
future. Rūăch Yehōvâh is not the first principle of the
physico-creaturely life (i.e., not equivalent to rūăch Elōhı̄m in [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002).md), but that of the spiritual or
ethical and religious life of man, which filled the prophets under the
Old Testament as a spirit of prophecy; consequently Joel describes its
operations under this form. "All flesh" signifies all men. The idea that
it embraces the irrational animals, even the locusts (Credner), is
rejected with perfect justice by Hitzig as an inconceivable thought, and
one unheard-of in the Bible; but he is wrong in adding that the Old
Testament does not teach a communication of the Spirit of God to all
men, but limits it to the people of Israel. A decided protest is entered
against this by [Gen 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md), where
Jehovah threatens that He will no longer let His Spirit rule bâ'âdâm,
i.e., in the human race, because it has become bâsâr (flesh). Bâsâr, as
contrasted with rūăch Yehōvâh, always denotes human nature regarded as
incapacitated for spiritual and divine life. Even in this verse we must
not restrict the expression "all flesh" to the members of the covenant
nation, as most of the commentators have done; for whatever truth there
may be in the remark made by Calovius and others (compare Hengstenberg,
Christol. i. p. 328 transl.), that the following clause, "your sons,
your daughters, your old men, your young men, and men-servants and
maid-servants," contains a specification of כּל־בּשׂר, it by no means
follows with certainty from this, that the word all does not do away
with the limitation to one particular nation, but merely that in this
one nation even the limits of sex, age, and rank are abolished; since it
cannot be proved that the specification in [Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md) and [Joe
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#003.md) is intended to exhaust the idea of
"all flesh." Moreover, as the prophecy of Joel had respect primarily to
Judah, Joel may primarily have brought into prominence, and specially
singled out of the general idea of kol-bâsâr in [Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md) and [Joe
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#029.md), only those points that were of
importance to his contemporaries, viz., that all the members of the
covenant nation would participate in this outpouring of the Spirit,
without regard to sex, age, or rank; and in so doing, he may have looked
away from the idea of the entire human race, including all nations,
which is involved in the expression "all flesh." We shall see from [Joe
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032.md) that this last thought was not a
strange one to the prophet. In the specification of the communication of
the Spirit, the different forms which it assumes are rhetorically
distributed as follows: to the sons and daughters, prophesying is
attributed; to the old, dreams; to the young, sights or visions. But it
by no means follows from this, that each of these was peculiar to the
age mentioned. For the assertion, that the Spirit of God only manifests
itself in the weakened mind of the old man by dreams and visions of the
night; that the vigorous and lively fancy of the youth or man has sights
by day, or true visions; and lastly, that in the soul of the child the
Spirit merely works as furor sacer Tychs., Credner, Hitzig, and others),
cannot be historically sustained. According to [Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md), visions and dreams are the two
forms of the prophetic revelation of God; and נבּא is the most general
manifestation of the prophetic gift, which must not be restricted to the
ecstatic state associated with the prophesying. The meaning of this
rhetorical individualizing, is simply that their sons, daughters, old
persons, and youths, would receive the Spirit of God with all its gifts.
The outpouring of the Spirit upon slaves (men-servants and maidens) is
connected by vegam, as being something very extraordinary, and under
existing circumstances not to be expected. Not a single case occurs in
the whole of the Old Testament of a salve receiving the gift of
prophecy. Amos, indeed, was a poor shepherd servant, but not an actual
slave. And the communication of this gift to slaves was irreconcilable
with the position of slaves under the Old Testament. Consequently even
the Jewish expositors could not reconcile themselves to this
announcement. The lxx, by rendering it ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους μου καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς
δούλας μου, have put servants of God in the place of the slaves of men;
and the Pharisees refused to the ὄχλος even a knowledge of the law ([Joh
7:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049).md). The gospel has therefore also
broken the fetters of slavery.

Judgment upon all nations goes side by side with the outpouring of the
Spirit of God. [Joe 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#030.md). "And I give
wonders in the heavens and on earth, blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.
[Joe 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md). The sun will turn into
darkness, and the moon into blood, before the day of Jehovah, the great
and terrible (day), comes. [Joe 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032.md).
And it comes to pass, every one who shall call upon the name of Jehovah
will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem will be fugitives, as
Jehovah hath said, and among those that are left will be those whom
Jehovah calls." With the word ונתתּי, [Joe
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#003.md) is attached to [Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002) as a simple continuation (Hitzig.md).
The wonders which God will give in the heavens and upon earth are the
forerunners of judgment. Mōphethı̄m (see at [Exo
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021).md) are extraordinary and marvellous
natural phenomena. The wonders on earth are mentioned first, in [Joe
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#030.md); then in [Joe
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md) those in the heavens. Blood and
fire recal to mind the plagues which fell upon Egypt as signs of the
judgment: the blood, the changing of the water of the Nile into blood
([Exo 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#017).md); the fire, the balls of
fire which fell to the earth along with the hail ([Exo
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#024).md). Blood and fire point to
bloodshed and war. Timrōth ‛âshân signifies cloud-pillars (here and in
[Sol 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006).md), whether we regard the form
timrōth as original, and trace it to timrâh and the root tâmar, or
prefer the reading תּימרות, which we meet with in many codices and
editions, and take the word as a derivative of yâmar = mūr, as
Hengstenberg does (Christol. i. p. 334 transl.). This sign has its type
in the descent of Jehovah upon Sinai, at which the whole mountain
smoked, and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a smelting-furnace
([Exo 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018).md). We have not to think,
therefore, of columns of cloud ascending from basons of fire, carried in
front of caravans or armies on the march to show the way (see at [Sol
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006).md), but of pillars of cloud, which
roll up from burning towns in time of war ([Isa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017).md). [Joe
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md). In the heavens the sun is
darkened, and the moon assumes a dull, blood-red appearance. These signs
also have their type in the Egyptian plague of darkness ([Exo
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021)..md). The darkening and extinction
of the lights of heaven are frequently mentioned, either as harbingers
of approaching judgment, or as signs of the breaking of the day of
judgment (it was so in [Joe 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md), [Joe
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010.md), and is so again in [Joe
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#014.md) : see also [Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010.md); [Isa
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md); [Jer
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md); [Eze
32:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md); [Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009.md); [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md); [Mar
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024.md); [Luk
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025).md). What we have to think of here,
is not so much periodically returning phenomena of nature, or eclipses
of the sun and moon, as extraordinary (not ecliptic) obscurations of the
sun and moon, such as frequently occur as accompaniments to great
catastrophes in human history.

(Note: Compare O. Zoeckler, Theologia Natural. i. p. 420, where
reference is made to Humboldt (Kosmos, iii. 413-17), who cites no fewer
than seventeen extraordinary cases of obscuration of the sun from the
historical tradition of past ages, which were occasioned, not by the
moon, but by totally different circumstances, such as diminished
intensity in the photosphere, unusually large spots in the sun,
extraneous admixtures in our own atmosphere, such as trade-wind dust,
inky rain, and sand rain, etc.; and many of which took place in most
eventful years, such as 45 b.c., a.d. 29 (the year of the Redeemer's
death), 358, 360, etc.)

And these earthly and celestial phenomena are forerunners and signs of
the approaching or bursting judgment; not only so far as subjective
faith is concerned, from the impression which is made upon the human
mind by rare and terrible phenomena of nature, exciting a feeling of
anxious expectation as to the things that are about to happen,

(Note: Calvin has taken too one-sided and subjective a view of the
matter, when he gives the following explanation of [Joe
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md) : "What is said here of the sun
and moon - namely, that the sun will be turned into darkness, and the
moon into blood - is metaphorical, and signifies that the Lord will fill
the whole universe with signs of His wrath, which will paralyze men with
fear, as if all nature were changed into a thing of horror. For just as
the sun and moon are witnesses of the paternal favour of God towards us,
while they give light in their turns to the earth, so, on the other
hand, the prophet affirms that they will be the heralds of an angry and
offended God.... By the darkness of the sun, the turning of the moon
into blood, and the black vapour of smoke, the prophet meant to express
the thought, that wherever men turned their eyes, everywhere, both above
and below, many things would meet the eye that would fill them with
terror. So that it is just as if he had said, that there had never been
such a state of misery in the world, nor so many fierce signs of the
wrath of God." For example, the assertion that they "are metaphorical
expressions" cannot possibly be sustained, but is at variance with the
scriptural view of the deep inward connection between heaven and earth,
and more particularly with the scriptural teaching, that with the last
judgment the present heavens and present earth will perish, and the
creation of a new heaven and a new earth will ensue. Moreover, the
circumstance that a belief in the significance of these natural
phenomena is met with in all nations, favours their real (not merely
imaginary) connection with the destinies of humanity.)

but also in their real connection with the onward progress of humanity
towards its divinely appointed goal, which may be explained from the
calling of man to be the lord of the earth, though it has not yet
received from science its due recognition and weight; in accordance with
which connection, they show "that the eternal motion of the heavenly
worlds is also appointed by the world-governing righteousness of God; so
that the continued secret operation of this peculiar quality manifests
itself through a strong cosmico-uranian symbolism, in facts of singular
historical significance" (Zoeckler, l. c.).

[Joel 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joe 2:31</span></span>

For [Joe 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md), see at [Joe
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md), [Joe
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011.md). But it is only by the world and
its children that the terrible day of the Lord is to be feared; to the
children of God it brings redemption ([Luk
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028).md). Whoever calls upon the name of
Jehovah, i.e., the believing worshippers of the Lord, will be exempted
from the judgment. "Calling upon the name of Jehovah" signifies not only
the public worship of God, but inward worship also, in which the
confession of the mouth is also an expression of the heart. Upon Mount
Zion will be pelētâh, i.e., not deliverance, but that which has escaped,
or, in a collective sense, those who have escaped the judgment, as the
synonym serı̄dı̄m, which follows, clearly shows. Mount Zion and Jerusalem
are not mentioned here as the capital of the kingdom of Judah, but,
according to their spiritual significance, as the place where the Lord
was enthroned in the sanctuary in the midst of His people; that is to
say, as the central spot of the kingdom of God. Consequently it is not
"to the whole nation of Judah as such that deliverance is promised, on
the assumption that in those times of distress the population of the
land would have streamed to Jerusalem" (Hitzig), but only to those who
call upon the name of the Lord, i.e., to the true worshippers of God,
upon whom the Spirit of God is poured out. The words כּאשׁר אמר יי are
not synonymous with נאם יי or כּי יי דּבּר ([Joe
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#008.md); [Isa
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#020.md); [Isa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005), etc..md), but point to a prophetic
word already known, viz., to [Oba
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017.md), where the saying of the Lord,
that in the midst of the judgment there would be rescued ones upon Mount
Zion, occurs word for word. וּבשּׂרידים also depends תּהיה ... כּי: "and
among those that remain will be those whom Jehovah calls." Sârı̄d is one
who is left after a judgment or a battle; hence in [Jer
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#017.md) and [Jos
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#022.md) it is connected with pâlı̄t (one
who has escaped from destruction), so that here serı̄dı̄m and pelētâh are
actually alike, the serı̄dı̄m being just the escaped ones upon Mount Zion.
Through this clause there is appended to what precedes the fresh
definition, that among the saved will be found those whom the Lord
calls. These may either be the believing portion of Judah, or believers
from among the heathen. If we adopted the first view, the sentence would
simply contain a more precise definition of the thought, that none are
saved but those who call upon the name of the Lord, and therefore would
preclude the possibility of including all the inhabitants of Judah among
those who call upon the Lord. If we took the second view, the sentence
would add this new feature to the thought contained in the first
hemistich, that not only citizens of Jerusalem and Judah would be saved
in the time of judgment, but all who called upon the Lord out of every
nation. The latter view deserves the preference, because the expression
קרא בשׁם יי did not need a more precise definition. The salvation of
believers from the heathen world is implied in the first half of the
verse, since it is simply connected with calling upon the name of the
Lord. The Apostle Paul has quoted it in this sense in [Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013.md), as a proof of the participation
of the heathen in the Messianic salvation.

If we proceed now to seek for the fulfilment of this prophecy, the
Apostle Peter quoted the whole of these verses (28-32), with the
exception of [Joe 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032.md), after the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples, on the first
Whitsuntide feast of the apostolical church, as having been fulfilled by
that Whitsuntide miracle ([Act
2:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017).md); and in his subsequent
reference to this fulfilment in Joel 2:39, "For the promise is unto you
and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the
Lord our God shall call," he even adds the closing words of Joel ([Joe
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032).md).

(Note: In quoting this passage Peter follows the lxx on the whole, even
in their deviations from the original text, viz., in ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματός
μου instead of רוּחי ([Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md), [Joe
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#029).md), in the addition of μου to ἐπὶ
τοὺς δούλους and δούλας ([Joe 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#029).md),
in ἐπιφανῆ for נורא ([Joe 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#004).md),
because these differences were of no consequence, so far as his object
was concerned. On the other hand, he has interpreted καὶ ἔσται μετὰ
ταῦτα (והיה אחרי כן) by καὶ ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέπαις, and added
for the same purpose, λέγει ὁ Θεός. He has also transposed the two
clauses καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ... and καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι, probably simply for
the purpose of letting the youths follow the sons and daughters, and
placing the old men in the third row; and lastly, he has added ἄνω to ἐν
τῶ οὐρανῶ ..., and κάτω to ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, to give greater prominence to
the antithesis.)

Consequently the Christian church from time immemorial has recognised in
the miracle of Pentecost the outpouring of the Spirit of God predicted
in [Joe 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md), [Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md) :

(Note: See Hengstenberg, Christol. i. pp. 345, 346, translation.)

so that the only point upon which there has been a division of opinion
has been, whether the fulfilment is to be confined to the feast of
Pentecost (as nearly all the fathers and earlier Lutheran commentators
suppose); or is to be sought for in certain events of Joel's own time,
as well as the first feast of Pentecost (Ephr. Syr., Grot., and others);
or, lastly, whether the occurrence at the first feast of Pentecost is to
be regarded as simply the beginning of the fulfilment which has
continued throughout the whole of the Christian era (Calov.,
Hengstenberg, and many others). Even the Rabbins, with the exception of
R. Mose Hakkohen in Aben Ezra, who sees only a reference to some event
in Joel's own time, expect the fulfilment to take place in the future on
the advent of the Messiah (Yarchi, Kimchi, Abarb.). Of the three views
expressed by Christian commentators, the third is the only one that
answers to the nature of the prophecy as correctly interpreted. The
outpouring of the Spirit of God, or the communication of it in all its
fulness to the covenant nation, without any limitation whatever, is a
standing mark with the prophets of the Messianic times (compare [Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md) with [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md) and [Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013).md) or new covenant ([Jer
31:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md); [Eze
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026.md).; [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md). And even if the way was opened
and prepared for this by the prophetic endowment of particular members
of the old covenant, these sporadic communications of the Spirit of God
in the Old Testament times cannot be regarded as the first steps in the
fulfilment of our prophecy, since they were not outpourings of the
Spirit of God. This first took place when Christ Jesus the Son of God
had completed the work of redemption, i.e., on the first feast of
Pentecost after the resurrection and ascension of Christ. Previous to
this the words of [Joh 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md) applied:
οὔπω ἦν πνεῦμα ἅγιον, ὅτι ὁ Ἰησοῦς οὐδέπω ἐδοξάστη. The reference in
this prophecy to the founding of the new covenant, or Christian church,
is also evident from the words, "And it shall come to pass afterwards,"
for which Peter substituted, "And it shall come to pass in the last
days," interpreting אחרי כן, the use of which was occasioned by the
retrospective reference to בּראשׁון in [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023.md), with perfect correctness so far
as the fact was concerned, by the formula answering to באחרית הימים,
viz., ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις, which always denotes the Messianic
future, or times of the completion of the kingdom of God. And just as
achărē khēn precludes any reference to an event in Joel's own time, so
does ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις preclude any fulfilment whatever in the
times before Christ. But however certain it may be that the fulfilment
first took place at the first Christian feast of Pentecost, we must not
stop at this one pentecostal miracle. The address of the Apostle Peter
by no means requires this limitation, but rather contains distinct
indications that Peter himself saw nothing more therein than the
commencement of the fulfilment, "but a commencement, indeed, which
embraced the ultimate fulfilment, as the germ enfolds the tree." We see
this in [Act 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md), where he exhorts
his hearers to repent and be baptized, and adds the promise, "and ye
shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost;" and again in [Act
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039.md), where he observes, "The promise
belongs to you and to your children, and to all that are afar off (τοῖς
εἰς μακράν), as many as the Lord our God will call." For if not only the
children of the apostle's contemporaries, but also those that were afar
off - i.e., not foreign Jews, but the far-off heathen - were to
participate in the gift of the Holy Spirit, the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit which commenced at Pentecost must continue as long as the Lord
shall receive into His kingdom those who re still standing afar off,
i.e., until the fulness of the Gentiles shall have entered the kingdom
of God. See Hengstenberg, Christology, i. pp. 326ff. transl., where
further reasons are adduced for taking this to be the allusion in the
prophecy.

There is far greater diversity in the opinions entertained as to the
fulfilment of [Joe 2:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#030.md) : some
thinking of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans (Grotius,
Turretius, and the Socinians); and others of judgments upon the enemies
of the covenant nation shortly after the return from the Babylonian
exile (Ephr. Syr. and others); others, again, of the last judgment
(Tertull., Theod., Crus.), or the destruction of Jerusalem and the last
judgment (Chrys.). Of all these views, those which refer to events
occurring before the Christian era are irreconcilable with the context,
according to which the day of the Lord will come after the outpouring of
the Spirit of God. Even the wonders connected with the death of Christ
and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, of which some
have thought, cannot properly be taken into account, although the
marvellous phenomena occurring at the death of Christ - the darkening of
the sun, the shaking of the earth, and the rending of the rocks - were
harbingers of the approaching judgment, and were recognised by the
ὄχλοις as warnings to repent, and so escape from the judgment ([Mat
27:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045.md), [Mat
27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051.md); [Luk
23:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#044.md), [Luk
23:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#048).md). For the signs in heaven and
earth that are mentioned in [Joe 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#030.md)
and [Joe 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md) were to take place
before the coming of the terrible day of the Lord, which would dawn
after the outpouring of the Spirit of God upon all flesh, and which
came, as history teaches, upon the Jewish nation that had rejected its
Saviour on the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and upon the
Gentile world-power in the destruction of the Roman empire, and from
that time forward breaks in constant succession upon one Gentile nation
after another, until all the ungodly powers of this world shall be
overthrown (cf. [Joe 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002).md). On account
of this internal connection between the day of Jehovah and the
outpouring of the Spirit upon the church of the Lord, Peter also quoted
vv. 30-32 of this prophecy, for the purpose of impressing upon the
hearts of all the hearers of his address the admonition, "Save
yourselves from this perverse generation" ([Act
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040).md), and also of pointing out the
way of deliverance from the threatening judgment to all who were willing
to be saved.
