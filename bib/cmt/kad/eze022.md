The Sins of Jerusalem and Israel

Ezekiel 22:1-16

To the prediction of the judgment in Ezekiel 21 there is appended
another description of the sins of Jerusalem and Israel, by which this
judgment is occasioned. The chapter contains three words of God, which
are connected together both in substance and design, viz., (1) The
blood-guiltiness and idolatry of Jerusalem accelerate the coming of the
days when the city will be an object of scorn to all the world (vv.
1-16); (2) The house of Israel has become dross, and is to be melted in
the fire of tribulation ([Eze
22:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#017)); (3) All ranks of the
kingdom - prophets, priests, princes, and people - are thoroughly
corrupt, therefore has the judgment burst upon them ([Eze
22:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#023)).

[Ezekiel 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 22:1</span></span>

Blood-guiltiness of Jerusalem and the burden of its sins. [Eze
22:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001) contain the principal
accusation relating to bloodshed and idolatry; and [Eze
22:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006) a further account of the sins
of the people and their rulers, with a brief threatening of punishment.
- [Eze 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#002). And
thou, son of man, wilt thou judge? wilt thou judge the city of
blood-guiltiness? then show it all its abominations, [Eze
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003). And say, Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, City, which sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time
may come, and maketh idols within itself for defilement. [Eze
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#004). Through thy blood which thou
hast shed hast thou made thyself guilty, and through thine idols which
thou hast made hast thou defiled thyself, and hast drawn thy days near,
and hast come to thy years; therefore I make thee a scorn to the
nations, and ridicule to all lands. [Eze
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#005). Those near and those far off
from thee shall ridicule thee as defiled in name, rich in confusion. -
The expression 'התשׁפּט וגו proves this address to be a continuation of
the reproof of Israel's sins, which commenced in [Eze
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#004). The epithet city of
blood-guiltiness, as in Ezekiel [Eze
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006), [Eze
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#009) (compare [Nah
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#001)), is explained in [Eze
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003). The apodosis commences with
והודעתּהּ, and is continued in [Eze
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003) (ואמרתּ). לבוא עתּהּ, that her
time, i.e., her time of punishment, may come: עתּהּ, like יומו in [Eze
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#030). ועשׂתּה is not a continuation
of the infinitive לבוא, but of the participle שׁפכת. עליה, of which
different renderings have been given, does not mean "over itself," i.e.,
as a burden with which it has laden itself (Hvernick); still less "for
itself" (Hitzig), a meaning which על never has, but literally "upon,"
i.e., in itself, covering the city with it, as it were. ותּקריבי, thou
hast brought near, brought on thy days, that is to say, the days of
judgment, and hast come to, arrived at thy years, sc. the years of
visitation and punishment (cf. [Jer
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#023)). This meaning is readily
supplied by the context. טמאת ה, defiled, unclean with regard to the
name, i.e., having forfeited the name of a holy city through capital
crimes and other sinful abominations. מהוּמה is internal confusion, both
moral and religious, as in [Amo 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009)
(cf. [Psa 55:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#010)).

In [Eze 22:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006) there follows an
enumeration of a multitude of sins which had been committed in
Jerusalem. - [Eze 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006). Behold, the
princes of Israel are every one, according to his arm, in thee to shed
blood. [Eze 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#007). Father and mother
they despise in thee; toward the foreigner they act violently in the
midst of thee; orphans and widows they oppress in thee. [Eze
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#008). Thou despisest my holy things,
and desecratest my Sabbaths. [Eze
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009). Slanderers are in thee to shed
blood, and they eat upon the mountains in thee; they practise lewdness
in thee. [Eze 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#010). They uncover the
father's nakedness in thee; they ravish the defiled in her uncleanness
in thee. [Eze 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#011). They take gifts
in thee to shed blood; interest and usury thou takest, and overreachest
thy neighbours with violence, and thou forgettest me, is the saying of
the Lord Jehovah. - By the repetition of the refrain, to shed blood
([Eze 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006), [Eze
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009), and [Eze
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#012)), the enumeration is divided
into three groups of sins, which are placed in the category of
blood-guiltiness by the fact that they are preceded by this sentence and
the repetition of it after the form of a refrain. the first group ([Eze
22:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006)) embraces sins which are
committed in daring opposition to all the laws of morality. By the
princes of Israel we are to understand primarily the profligate kings,
who caused innocent persons to be put to death, such, for example, as
Jehoiakim ([Kg2 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#004)), Manasseh ([Kg2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016)), and others. The words אישׁ are
rendered by Hitzig and Kliefoth, they were ready to help one another;
and in support of the rendering they appeal to [Psa
83:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009). But in that case אישׁ לזרעו
would stand for לזרע אישׁ rof dnat, or rather for אישׁ זרוע לאישׁ, - a
substitution which cannot be sustained. Nor can they be taken in the
sense proposed by Hvernick, every one relying upon his arm, i.e.,
looking to physical force alone, but simply every one according to his
arm, i.e., according to his strength or violence, are they in thee. In
this case היוּ does not require anything to be supplied, any more than
in the similar combination in [Eze
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009). Followed by למען with an
infinitive, it means to be there with the intention of doing anything,
or making an attempt, i.e., to direct his efforts to a certain end. In
[Eze 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#007) it is not the princes who
are the subject, but the ungodly in general. הקלּוּ is the opposite of
כּבּד ([Exo 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012)). In the reproofs
which follow, compare [Exo 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#020).;
[Lev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#013); [Deu
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014). With insolence and violence
toward men there is associated contempt of all that is holy. For [Eze
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#008), see [Eze
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#013). - In the second group, [Eze
22:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009), in addition to slander and
idolatry, the crimes of lewdness and incest are the principal sins for
which the people are reproved; and here the allusion to Lev 18 and 19 is
very obvious. The reproof of slander also points back to the prohibition
in [Lev 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#016). Slander to shed blood,
refers to malicious charges and false testimony in a court of justice
(vid., [Kg1 21:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#010)). For eating upon
the mountains, see [Eze 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006). The
practice of zimmâh is more specifically described in [Eze
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#010) and [Eze
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#011). For the thing itself, compare
[Lev 18:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007); [Lev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015) and [Lev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#009). The threefold אישׁ in [Eze
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#011) does not mean every one, but
one, another, and the third, as the correlative רעהוּ shows. - The third
group, [Eze 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#012), is composed of sins
of covetousness. For the first clause, compare the prohibition in [Exo
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#002); for the second, [Eze
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008), [Eze
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013). The reproof finishes with
forgetfulness of God, which is closely allied to covetousness.

[Eze 22:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#013)

The Lord is enraged at such abominable doings. He will interfere, and
put an end to them by scattering Judah among the heathen. - [Eze
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#013). And, behold, I smite my hand
because of thy gain which thou hast made, and over thy bloodguiltiness
which is in the midst of thee. [Eze
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#014). Will thy heart indeed stand
firm, or will thy hands be strong for the day when I shall deal with
thee? I Jehovah have spoken it, and also do it. [Eze
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#015). I will scatter thee among the
nations, and disperse thee in the lands, and will utterly remove thine
uncleanness from thee. [Eze 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#016). And
thou wilt be desecrated through thyself before the eyes of the nations,
and know that I am Jehovah. - [Eze
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#013) is closely connected with the
preceding verse. This serves to explain the fact that the only sins
mentioned as exciting the wrath of God are covetousness and
blood-guiltiness. הכּה , as [Kg2 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#012)
clearly shows, is a contracted expression for הכּה כּף אל ([Eze
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#019)), and the smiting of the hands
together is a gesture indicative of wrathful indignation. For the form
דּמך, contracted from דּמיך, see the comm. on [Eze
16:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#045). - As [Eze
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#013) leads on to the threatening of
judgment, so does [Eze 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#014) point in
anticipation to the terrible nature of the judgment itself. The
question, "will thy heart stand firm?" involves a warning against
security. עמד is the opposite of נמס (cf. [Eze
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012)), as standing forms the
antithesis to passing away (cf. [Psa
102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027)). עשׂה אותך, as in [Eze
16:59](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#059) and [Eze
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#027). The Lord will scatter them (cf.
[Eze 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#015); [Eze
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#023)), and remove the uncleanness of
sin, namely, by purifying the people in exile (cf. [Isa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004)). התם, from תּמם, to cause to
cease, with מן, to take completely away. נחלתּ, Niphal of חלל fo lahpiN
,נחלתּ ., connected with לעיני גּוים, as in [Eze
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#009), not from נחל, as many of the
commentators who follow the Septuagint and Vulgate suppose. בּך, not in
te, in thyself, but through thee, i.e., through thy sinful conduct and
its consequences.

[Ezekiel 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#017)

Refining of Israel in the Furnace of Besieged Jerusalem

[Eze 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#017). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018). Son of
man, the house of Israel has become to me as dross; they are all brass,
and tin, and iron, and lead in the furnace; dross of silver have they
become. [Eze 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#019). Therefore thus
saith the Lord Jehovah, Because ye have all become dross, therefore,
behold, I gather you together in Jerusalem. [Eze
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#020). As men gather together silver,
and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin into the furnace, to blow the
fire upon it for melting, so will I gather (you) together in my anger
and my wrath, and put you in and melt you. [Eze
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#021). And I will collect you
together, and blow the fire of my wrath upon you, that ye may be melted
therein. [Eze 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#022). As silver is
melted in the furnace, so shall ye be melted therein (viz., in
Jerusalem), and shall learn that I Jehovah have poured out my wrath upon
you. - This second word of God rests no doubt upon the figure in [Eze
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#015), of the uncleanness or dirt of
sin; but it is not an exposition of the removal of the dirt, as
predicted there. For that was to be effected through the dispersion of
Israel among the nations, whereas the word of God, from [Eze
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#017) onwards, represents the siege
awaiting Jerusalem as a melting process, through which God will separate
the silver ore contained in Israel from the baser metals mingled with
it. In [Eze 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018) it commences with a
description of the existing condition of Israel. It has turned to dross.
היוּ is clearly a perfect, and is not to be taken as a prophetical
future, as Kliefoth proposes. Such a rendering is not only precluded by
the clause 'יען היות in [Eze 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#019),
cut could only be made to yield an admissible sense by taking the middle
clause of the verse, "all of them brass and tin," etc., as a statement
of what Israel had become, or as a preterite in opposition to all the
rules of Hebrew syntax, inasmuch as this clause merely furnishes an
explanation of היוּ־לסוּג. סוּג, which only occurs here, for סיג
signifies dross, not smelting-ore (Kliefoth), literally, recedanea, the
baser ingredients which are mixed with the silver, and separated from it
by smelting. This is the meaning here, where it is directly afterwards
interpreted as consisting of brass, tin, iron, and lead, and then still
further defined as סגּים כּסף, dross of silver, i.e., brass, tin, iron,
and lead, with a mixture of silver. Because Israel had turned into
silver-dross of this kind, the Lord would gather it together in
Jerusalem, to smelt it there as in a smelting furnace; just as men
gather together brass, iron, lead, and tin in a furnace to smelt them,
or rather to separate the silver contained thereon. קבצת כּסף,
literally, a collection of silver, etc., for "like a collection." The כ
simil. is probably omitted for the sake of euphony, to avoid the discord
occasioned by prefixing it to קבצת. Ezekiel mentions the silver as well,
because there is some silver contained in the brass, iron, etc., or the
dross is silver-dross. התּוּך, nomen verbale, from נתך in the Hiphil,
smelting; literally, as the smelting of silver takes place in the
furnace. The smelting is treated here simply as a figurative
representation of punishment, and consequently the result of the
smelting, namely, the refining of the silver by the removal of the baser
ingredients, is not referred to any further, as in the case in [Isa
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022), [Isa
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025); [Jer
6:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#027); [Mal
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002). This smelting process was
experienced by Israel in the last siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans.

[Ezekiel 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 22:23</span></span>

The corrupt state of all classes in the kingdom is the immediate cause
of its destruction. - [Eze 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#023). And
the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, [Eze
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#024). Son of man, say to it, Thou art
a land which is not shined upon, nor rained upon in the day of anger.
[Eze 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025). Conspiracy of its prophets
is within it; like a roaring lion, which rends in pieces the prey, they
devour souls, take possessions and money; they multiply its widows
within it. [Eze 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026). Its priests
violate my law and profane my holy things; they make no distinction
between holy and unholy, and do not teach the difference between clean
and unclean, and they hide their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am
profaned among them. [Eze 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027). Its
princes in the midst of it are like wolves, which rend prey in pieces,
that they may shed blood, destroy souls, to acquire gain. [Eze
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028). And its prophets plaster it
with cement, seeing what is worthless, and diving lies for them, saying,
"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah," when Jehovah hath not spoken. [Eze
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#029). The common people offer
violence and commit theft; they crush the wretched and the poor, and
oppress the foreigner against right. [Eze
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030). I seek among them for a man who
might build a wall and step into the breach before me on behalf of the
land, that I might not destroy it, but I find none. [Eze
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#031). Therefore I pour out my anger
upon them; I destroy them in the fire of my wrath, I give their way upon
their head, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - To show the necessity
for the predicted judgment still more clearly, in the third word of God
contained in this chapter a description is given of the spread of deep
corruption among all classes of the people, and the impossibility of
saving the kingdom is plainly shown. The words אמר־להּ, "say unto her,"
are taken by most of the commentators as referring to Jerusalem, the
abominations of which the prophet is commanded to declare. But although
the clause, "thou art a land," etc. ([Eze
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#024)), could unquestionably be made
to harmonize with this, yet the words of [Eze
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030), "I sought for a man who might
stand in the gap before Jehovah for the land," indicate most
unquestionably that this word of God is directed against the land of
Judah, and consequently להּ must be taken as referring to ארץ which
follows, the pronoun is this case being placed before the noun to which
it refers, as in [Num 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017). Any
allusion to the city of Jerusalem would therefore be somewhat out of
place, inasmuch as in the preceding word of God the object referred to
was not the city, but the house of Israel, or the nation generally, from
which a transition is here made to the land, or the kingdom of Judah.
The meaning of [Eze 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#024) is a
disputed question. לא מטהרה היא, which is rendered ἡ οὐ βρεχομένηin the
Sept., is taken by most of the expositors to mean, "it is not cleansed,"
the form מטהרה being correctly rendered as a participle Pual of טהר. But
this rendering does not furnish any appropriate sense, unless the
following words לא גּשׁמהּ are taken as a threat: there shall not be
rain, or it shall not be rained upon in the day of wrath. But this view
is hardly reconcilable with the form of the word. גּשׁמהּ, according to
the Masoretic pointing with Mappik in the ה, is evidently meant to be
taken as a noun גּשׁם = גּשׁם. In that case, if the words were intended
to contain a threat, יהיה ought not to be omitted. But without a verb
the words contain a statement in harmony with what precedes. We regard
the Chetib גשׁמה as the perfect Pual גּשׁמהּ. And let it not be objected
to this that the Pual of this verb is not met with elsewhere, for the
form of the noun גּשׁם with the u sound does not occur anywhere else. As
a perfect Pual, לא גּשׁמהּ is a simple continuation of the participial
clause לא מטהרה היא, containing like this an affirmation, and cannot
possibly be taken as a threat or prediction. But "not cleansed" and "not
rained upon" do not agree together, as rain is not a means of
purification according to the Hebrew idea. It is true that in the law
the withdrawal or suspension of rain is threatened as a punishment from
God, and the pouring out of rain is promised as a theocratical blessing.
But even if the words are taken in a tropical sense, as denoting a
withdrawal of the blessings of divine grace, they will not harmonize
with the other clause, "not cleansed." We therefore take מטהרה in the
sense of "shined upon by the light," or provided with brightness; a
meaning which is sustained by [Exo
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010), where tohar occurs in the sense
of splendour, and by the kindred word tzohar, light. In this way we
obtain the suitable thought, land which has neither sunlight nor rain in
the day of wrath, i.e., does not enjoy a single trace of the divine
blessing, but is given up to the curse of barrenness.

The reason for this threat is given in [Eze
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025)., where a picture is drawn of
the moral corruption of all ranks; viz., of the prophets ([Eze
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025)), the priests ([Eze
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026)), the princes ([Eze
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027)), and the common people ([Eze
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#029)). There is something very
striking in the allusion to the prophets in [Eze
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025), not so much because they are
mentioned again in [Eze 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028), - for
this may be accounted for on the ground that in the latter passage they
are simply introduced as false advisers of the princes, - as on account
of the statement made concerning them in [Eze
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025), namely, that, like lions
tearing their prey, they devour souls, etc.; a description which is not
given either in Ezekiel 13 or elsewhere. Hitzig therefore proposes to
alter נביאיה into נשׂיאיה, after the rendering ἀφηγούμενοι given by the
lxx. This alteration of the text, which confines itself to a single
letter, is rendered very plausible by the fact that almost the same is
affirmed of the persons mentioned in [Eze
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025) as of the princes in [Eze
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027), and that in the passage in
Zephaniah ([Zep 3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003)), which is so
similar to the one before us, that Ezekiel appears to have had it in his
mind, the princes (שׂריה) and the judges (שׁפטיה) are called the
prophets and the priests. The נשׂיאים here would correspond to the שׂרים
of Zephaniah, and the שׂרים to the שׁפטים. According to [Eze
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006), the נשׂיאים would indicate
primarily the members of the royal family, possibly including the chief
officers of the crown; and the שׂרים eht dna ;n ([Eze
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027)) would be the heads of tribes,
of families, and of fathers' houses, in whose hands the national
administration of justice principally lay (cf. [Exo
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#019).; [Deu
1:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#013); and my Bibl. Archol. ii.
149). I therefore prefer this conjecture, or correction, to the
Masoretic reading, although the latter is supported by ancient
witnesses, such as the Chaldee with its rendering ספרהא, scribes, and
the version of Jerome. For the statement which the verse contains is not
applicable to prophets, and the best explanation given of the Masoretic
text - namely, that by Michaelis, "they have made a compact with one
another as to what kind of teaching they would or would not give; and in
order that their authority may continue undisturbed, they persecute even
to blood those who do not act with them, or obey them, but rather
contradict" - does not do justice to the words, but weakens their sense.
קשׁר is not a predicate to 'נב, "they are (i.e., form) a conspiracy;"
but 'נב is a genitive. At the same time, there is no necessity to take
קשׁר in the sense of "company," a rendering which cannot be sustained.
The fact that in what follows, where the comparison to lions is
introduced, the נביאים (נשׂיאים) are the subject, simply proves that in
the first clause also these men actually form the prominent idea. There
is no ground for supplying המּה to 'כּארי (they are like, etc.); but the
simile is to be linked on to the following clause. נפשׁ אכלוּ is to be
explained from the comparison to a lion, which devours the prey that it
has captured in its blood, in which is the soul, or nephesh ([Gen
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004); [Lev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011).). The thought is this: in their
insatiable greed for riches they sacrifice men and put them to death,
and thereby multiply the number of victims (for the fact, see [Eze
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005), [Eze
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#007)). What is stated in [Eze
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026) concerning the priests is simply
a further expansion of [Zep 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004), where
the first two clauses occur word for word; for קדשׁ in Zephaniah is
really equivalent to קדשׁי, holy things and deeds. The desecration of
the holy things consisted in the fact that they made no distinction
between sacred and profane, clean and unclean. For the fact, compare
[Lev 10:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010). Their covering their
eyes from the Sabbaths showed itself in their permitting the Sabbaths to
be desecrated by the people, without offering any opposition (cf. [Jer
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#027)).

The comparison of the rulers (sārim) to ravening wolves is taken from
[Zep 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003). Destroying souls to acquire
gain is perfectly applicable to unjust judges, inasmuch as, according to
[Exo 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#021), the judges were to hate
בּצע. All that is affirmed in [Eze
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028) of the conduct of the false
prophets is repeated for the most part verbatim from [Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010),[Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009), and [Eze
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#007). By להם, which points back to the
three classes of men already mentioned, and not merely to the sārim, the
prophets are represented as helpers of those who support the ungodly in
their wicked ways, by oracles which assured them of prosperity. עם ([Eze
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#029)), as distinguished from the
spiritual and secular rulers of the nation, signifies the common people.
With reference to their sins and wickednesses, see [Eze
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#007), [Eze
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#012), [Eze
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#018); and for the command against
oppressing the poor and foreigners, compare [Exo
22:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#020); [Deu
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017). - The corruption is so
universal, that not a man is to be found who could enter into the gap as
a righteous man, or avert the judgment of destruction by his
intercession. מהם refers not merely to the prophets, who did not enter
into the gap according to [Eze 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005),
but to all the classes previously mentioned. At the same time, it does
not follow from this, that entering into the gap by means of
intercession cannot be the thing intended, as Hitzig supposes. The
expression לפני בּעד הארץ clearly refers to intercession. This is
apparent from the simple fact that, as Hitzig himself observes, the
intercession of Abraham for Sodom ([Gen
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#013).) was floating before the mind
of Ezekiel, since the concluding words of the verse contain an obvious
allusion to [Gen 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#028). Because the
Lord does not find a single righteous man, who might intercede for the
land, He pours out His anger upon it, to destroy the inhabitants
thereof. With reference to the fact and the separate words employed,
compare Ezekiel 21:36; [Eze 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#004); [Eze
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#010); [Eze
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#021), and [Eze
16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043). It does not follow from the
word ואשׁפּך, that Ezekiel "is speaking after the catastrophe" (Hitzig).
For although ואשׁפּך expresses the consequence of Jehovah's seeking a
righteous man and not finding one, it by no means follows from the
occurrence of the preterite ולא מצאתי that ואשׁפּך is also a preterite.
ואשׁפּך is simply connected with ואבקּשׁ as a consequence; and in both
verbs the Vav consec. expresses the sequence of thought, and not of
time. The seeking, therefore, with the result of not having found,
cannot be understood in a chronological sense, i.e., as an event
belonging to the past, for the simple reason that the preceding words do
not record the chronological order of events. It merely depicts the
existing moral condition of the people, and [Eze
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030) sums up the result of the
description in the thought that there was no one to be found who could
enter in the gap before God. Consequently we cannot determine from the
imperfect with Vav consec. either the time of the seeking and not
finding, or that of the pouring out of the wrath.
