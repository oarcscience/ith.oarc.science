### [Deuteronomy Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 8:1</span></span>

In addition to the danger of being drawn aside to transgress the
covenant, by sparing the Canaanites and their idols out of pusillanimous
compassion and false tolerance, the Israelites would be especially in
danger, after their settlement in Canaan, of falling into pride and
forgetfulness of God, when enjoying the abundant productions of that
land. To guard against this danger, Moses set before them how the Lord
had sought to lead and train them to obedience by temptations and
humiliations during their journey through the desert. In order that his
purpose in doing this might be clearly seen, he commenced ([Deu
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001).md) with the renewed admonition to
keep the whole law which he commanded them that day, that they might
live and multiply and attain to the possession of the promised land (cf.
[Deu 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001.md); [Deu
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#003).md).

[Deu 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md)

To this end they were to remember the forty years' guidance through the
wilderness ([Deu 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031.md); [Deu
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#007).md), by which God desired to humble
them, and to prove the state of their heart and their obedience.
Humiliation was the way to prove their attitude towards God. ענּה, to
humble, i.e., to bring them by means of distress and privations to feel
their need of help and their dependence upon God. נסּה, to prove, by
placing them in such positions in life as would drive them to reveal
what was in their heart, viz., whether they believed in the omnipotence,
love, and righteousness of God, or not.

[Deu 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md)

The humiliation in the desert consisted not merely in the fact that God
let the people hunger, i.e., be in want of bread and their ordinary
food, but also in the fact that He fed them with manna, which was
unknown to them and their fathers (cf. [Exo
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016)..md). Feeding with manna is called
a humiliation, inasmuch as God intended to show to the people through
this food, which had previously been altogether unknown to them, that
man does not live by bread alone, that the power to sustain life does
not rest upon bread only ([Isa 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016.md);
[Gen 27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040).md), or belong simply to it,
but to all that goeth forth out of the mouth of Jehovah. That which
"proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah" is not the word of the law, as
the Rabbins suppose, but, as the word כּל (all, every) shows, "the word"
generally, the revealed will of God to preserve the life of man in
whatever way (Schultz): hence all means designed and appointed by the
Lord for the sustenance of life. In this sense Christ quotes these words
in reply to the tempter ([Mat 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004).md),
not to say to him, The Messiah lives not by (material) bread only, but
by the fulfilment of the will of God (Usteri, Ullmann), or by trusting
in the sustaining word of God (Olshausen); but that He left it to God to
care for the sustenance of His life, as God could sustain His life in
extraordinary ways, even without the common supplies of food, by the
power of His almighty word and will.

[Deu 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#004.md)

As the Lord provided for their nourishment, so did He also in a
marvellous way for the clothing of His people during these forty years.
"Thy garment did not fall of thee through age, and thy foot did not
swell." בּלה with מן, to fall off from age. בּצק only occurs again in
[Neh 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#021.md), where this passage is
repeated. The meaning is doubtful. The word is certainly connected with
בּצק (dough), and probably signifies to become soft or to swell,
although בּצק is also used for unleavened dough. The Septuagint
rendering here is ו̓פץכש́טחףבם, to get hard skin; on the other hand, in
[Neh 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#021.md), we find the rendering
ὑποδήματα αὐτῶν ου' διεῤῥάγησαν, "their sandals were not worn out," from
the parallel passage in [Deu 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#005.md).
These words affirm something more than "clothes and shoes never failed
you," inasmuch as ye always had wool, hides, leather, and other kinds of
material in sufficient quantities for clothes and shoes, as not only J.
D. Michaelis and others suppose, but Calmet, and even Kurtz. Knobel is
quite correct in observing, that "this would be altogether too trivial a
matter by the side of the miraculous supply of manna, and moreover that
it is not involved in the expression itself, which rather affirms that
their clothes did not wear out upon them, or fall in tatters from their
backs, because God gave them a miraculous durability" (Luther, Calvin,
Baumgarten, Schultz, etc.). At the same time, there is no necessity to
follow some of the Rabbins and Justin Martyr (dial. c. Tryph. c. 131),
who so magnify the miracle of divine providence, as to maintain not only
that the clothes of the Israelites did not get old, but that as the
younger generation grew up their clothes also grew upon their backs,
like the shells of snails. Nor is it necessary to shut out the different
natural resources which the people had at their command for providing
clothes and sandals, any more than the gift of manna precluded the use
of such ordinary provisions as they were able to procure.

[Deu 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#005.md)

In this way Jehovah humbled and tempted His people, that they might
learn in their heart, i.e., convince themselves by experience, that
their God was educating them as a father does his son. יסּר, to
admonish, chasten, educate; like παιδεύειν. "It includes everything
belonging to a proper education" (Calvin).

[Deu 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#006.md)

The design of this education was to train them to keep His commandments,
that they might walk in His ways and fear Him ([Deu
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#024).md).

[Deuteronomy 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 8:7</span></span>

The Israelites were to continue mindful of this paternal discipline on
the part of their God, when the Lord should bring them into the good
land of Canaan. This land Moses describes in [Deu
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#008.md), [Deu
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#009.md), in contrast with the dry
unfruitful desert, as a well-watered and very fruitful land, which
yielded abundance of support to its inhabitants; a land of water-brooks,
fountains, and floods (תּהומות, see [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002).md), which had their source (took
their rise) in valleys and on mountains; a land of wheat and barley, of
the vine, fig, and pomegranate, and full of oil and honey (see at [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008).md); lastly, a land "in which thou
shalt not eat (support thyself) in scarcity, and shalt not be in want of
anything; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose mountains thou
hewest brass." The stones are iron, i.e., ferruginous. This statement is
confirmed by modern travellers, although the Israelites did not carry on
mining, and do not appear to have obtained either iron or brass from
their own land. The iron and brass of which David collected such
quantities for the building of the temple ([Ch1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#003.md), [Ch1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014).md), he procured from Betach and
Berotai ([Sa2 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#008).md), or Tibchat and Kun
([Ch1 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008).md), towns of Hadadezer, that
is to say, from Syria. According to [Eze
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#019.md), however, the Danites brought
iron-work to the market of Tyre. Not only do the springs near Tiberias
contain iron (v. Schubert, R. iii. p. 239), whilst the soil at Hasbeya
and the springs in the neighbourhood are also strongly impregnated with
iron (Burckhardt, Syrien, p. 83), but in the southern mountains as well
there are probably strata of iron between Jerusalem and Jericho
(Russegger, R. iii. p. 250). But Lebanon especially abounds in
iron-stone; iron mines and smelting furnaces being found there in many
places (Volney, Travels; Burckhardt, p. 73; Seetzen, i. pp. 145, 187ff.,
237ff.). The basalt also, which occurs in great masses in northern
Canaan by the side of the limestone, from the plain of Jezreel onwards
(Robinson, iii. p. 313), and is very predominant in Bashan, is a
ferruginous stone. Traces of extinct copper-works are also found upon
Lebanon (Volney, Travels; Ritter's Erdkunde, xvii. p. 1063).

[Deuteronomy 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 8:10</span></span>

But if the Israelites were to eat there and be satisfied, i.e., to live
in the midst of plenty, they were to beware of forgetting their God;
that when their prosperity - their possessions, in the form of lofty
houses, cattle, gold and silver, and other good things - increased,
their heart might not be lifted up, i.e., they might not become proud,
and, forgetting their deliverance from Egypt and their miraculous
preservation and guidance in the desert, ascribe the property they had
acquired to their own strength and the work of their own hands. To keep
the people from this danger of forgetting God, which follows so easily
from the pride of wealth, Moses once more enumerates in [Deu
8:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#014.md) the manifestations of divine
grace, their deliverance from Egypt the slave-house, their being led
through the great and terrible desert, whose terrors he depicts by
mentioning a series of noxious and even fatal things, such as snakes,
burning snakes (saraph, see at Num 21; 6), scorpions, and the thirsty
land where there was no water. The words from נחשׁ, onwards, are
attached rhetorically to what precedes by simple apposition, without any
logically connecting particle; though it will not do to overlook
entirely the rhetorical form of the enumeration, and supply the
preposition בּ before נחשׁ and the words which follow, to say nothing of
the fact that it would be quite out of character before these nouns in
the singular, as a whole people could not go through one serpent, etc.
In this parched land the Lord brought he people water out of the flinty
rock, the hardest stone, and fed them with manna, to humble them and
tempt them (cf. [Deu 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002).md), in order
(this was the ultimate intention of all the humiliation and trial) "to
do thee good at thy latter end." The "latter end" of any one is "the
time which follows some distinct point in his life, particularly an
important epoch-making point, and which may be regarded as the end by
contrast, the time before that epoch being considered as the beginning"
(Schultz). In this instance Moses refers to the period of their life in
Canaan, in contrast with which the period of their sojourn in Egypt and
their wandering in the desert is recorded as the beginning; consequently
the expression does not relate to death as the end of life, as in [Num
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010.md), although this allusion is not
to be altogether excluded, as a blessed death is only the completion of
a blessed life. - Like all the guidance of Israel by the Lord, what is
stated here is applicable to all believers. It is through humiliations
and trials that the Lord leads His people to blessedness. Through the
desert of tribulation, anxiety, distress, and merciful interposition, He
conducts them to Canaan, into the land of rest, where they are refreshed
and satisfied in the full enjoyment of the blessings of His grace and
salvation; but those alone who continue humble, not attributing the good
fortune and prosperity to which they attain at last, to their own
exertion, strength, perseverance, and wisdom, but gratefully enjoying
this good as a gift of the grace of God. חיל עשׂה, to create property,
to prosper in wealth (as in [Num
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018).md). God gave strength for this
([Deu 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#018).md), not because of Israel's
merit and worthiness, but to fulfil His promises which He had made on
oath to the patriarchs. "As this day," as was quite evident then, when
the establishment of the covenant had already commenced, and Israel had
come through the desert to the border of Canaan (see [Deu
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020).md).

[Deuteronomy 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 8:19</span></span>

To strengthen his admonition, Moses pointed again in conclusion, as he
had already done in [Deu 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#014.md) (cf.
[Deu 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#025)..md), to the destruction which
would come upon Israel through apostasy from its God.
