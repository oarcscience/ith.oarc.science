### [Numbers Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 4:1</span></span>

Rules of Service, and Numbering of the Levites Qualified for Service. -
After the adoption of the Levites for service at the sanctuary, in the
place of the first-born of Israel, Moses and Aaron mustered the three
families of the Levites by the command of God for the service to be
performed by those who were between the ages of 30 and 50. The
particulars of the service are first of all described in detail (vv.
4-33); and then the men in each family are taken, of the specified age
for service (vv. 34-49). The three families are not arranged according
to the relative ages of their founders, but according to the importance
or sacredness of their service. The Kohathites take the lead, because
the holiest parts of the tabernacle were to be carried and kept by this
family, which included the priests, Aaron and his sons. The service to
be performed by each of the three Levitical families is introduced in
every case by a command from God to take the sum of the men from 30
years old to 50 (see [Num 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#001.md), [Num
4:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#021.md), [Num
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#029.md) and [Num
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#030).md).

[Numbers 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 4:2</span></span>

Service of the Kohathites, and the number qualified for service. - [Num
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#002.md), [Num
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md). "Take the sum of the sons of
Kohath from among the sons of Levi:" i.e., by raising them out of the
sum total of the Levites, by numbering them first and specially, viz.,
the men from 30 to 50 years of age, "every one who comes to the
service," i.e., who has to enter upon service "to do work at the
tabernacle." צבא (Angl. 'host') signifies military service, and is used
here with special reference to the service of the Levites as the militia
sacra of Jehovah.

[Numbers 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 4:4</span></span>

The service of the Kohathites at the tabernacle is (relates to) "the
most holy" (see at [Exo 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010).md). This
term includes, as is afterwards explained, the most holy things in the
tabernacle, viz., the ark of the covenant, the table of shew-bread, the
candlestick, the altar of incense and altar of burnt-offering, together
with all the other things belonging to these. When the camp was broken
up, the priests were to roll them up in wrappers, and hand them over in
this state to the Kohathites, for them to carry ([Num
4:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005).md). First of all ([Num
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005.md), [Num
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#006).md), Aaron and his sons were to take
down the curtain between the holy place and the most holy (see [Exo
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031).md), and to cover the ark of
testimony with it ([Exo 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010).md). Over
this they were to place a wrapper of sea-cow skin (tachash, see [Exo
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005).md), and over this again another
covering of cloth made entirely of hyacinth-coloured purple (as in [Exo
28:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#031).md). The sea-cow skin as to protect
the inner curtain, which was covered over the ark, from storm and rain;
the hyacinth purple, to distinguish the ark of the covenant as the
throne of the glory of Jehovah. Lastly, they were to place the staves
into the rings again, that is to say, the bearing poles, which were
always left in their places on the ark ([Exo
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015).md), but had necessarily to be
taken out while it was being covered and wrapped up.

[Numbers 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 4:7</span></span>

Over the table of shew-bread ([Exo
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023).md) they were to spread a hyacinth
cloth, to place the plates, bowls, wine-pitchers, and drink-offering
bowls ([Exo 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029).md) upon the top of
this, and to lay shew-bread thereon; and then to spread a crimson cloth
over these vessels and the shew-bread, and cover this with a sea-cow
skin, and lastly to put the bearing poles in their places.

[Numbers 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 4:9</span></span>

The candlestick, with its lamps, snuffers, extinguishers ([Exo
25:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031).md), and all its oil-vessels
(oil-cans), "wherewith they serve it," i.e., prepare it for the holy
service, were to be covered with a hyacinth cloth, and then with a
wrapper of sea-cow skin, and laid upon the carriage. מות ([Num
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#010.md) and [Num
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#012).md), bearing frame, in [Num
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md) bearing poles.

[Numbers 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 4:11</span></span>

So again they were to wrap up the altar of incense ([Exo
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001).md), to adjust its bearing poles;
and having wrapped it up in such coverings, along with the vessels
belonging to it, to lay it upon the frame.

[Numbers 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 4:13</span></span>

The altar of burnt-offering was first of all to be cleansed from the
ashes; a crimson cloth was then to be covered over it, and the whole of
the furniture belonging to it to be placed upon the top; and lastly, the
whole was to be covered with a sea-cow skin. The only thing not
mentioned is the copper laver ([Exo
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018).md), probably because it was
carried without any cover at all. The statement in the Septuagint and
the Samaritan text, which follows [Num
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#014.md). respecting its covering and
conveyance upon a frame, is no doubt a spurious interpolation.

[Numbers 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 4:15</span></span>

After the priests had completed the wrapping up of all these things, the
Kohathites were to come up to carry them; but they were not to touch
"the holy" (the holy things), lest they should die (see [Num
1:53](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#053.md); [Num
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#003.md), and comp. [Sa2
6:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006).md).

[Numbers 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 4:16</span></span>

The oversight of the oil for the candlestick ([Exo
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020).md), the incense ([Exo
30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034).md), the continual meat-offering
([Exo 29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040).md), and the anointing oil
([Exo 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023).md), belonged to Eleazar as
the head of all the Levites ([Num
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#032).md). He had also the oversight of
the dwelling and all the holy things and furniture belonging to it; and,
as a comparison of [Num 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#028.md) and [Num
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#033.md) clearly shows, of the services of
the Kohathites also.

[Numbers 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 4:17</span></span>

In order to prevent as far as possible any calamity from befalling the
Levites while carrying the most holy things, the priests are again urged
by the command of God to do what has already been described in detail in
[Num 4:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005.md), lest through any
carelessness on their part they should cut off the tribe of the families
of the Kohathites, i.e., should cause their destruction; viz., if they
should approach the holy things before they had been wrapped up by Aaron
and his sons in the manner prescribed and handed over to them to carry.
If the Kohathites should come for only a single moment to look at the
holy things, they would die. אל־תּכריתוּ, "cut ye not off," i.e., "take
care that the Kohathites are not cut off through your mistake and
negligence" (Ros.). "The tribe of the families of the Kohathites:"
shebet, the tribe, is not used here, as it frequently is, in its
derivative sense of tribe (Tribus), but in the original literal sense of
stirps.

[Numbers 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 4:19</span></span>

"This do to them:" sc., what is prescribed in [Num
4:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005.md) with reference to their
service.

[Numbers 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 4:20</span></span>

כּבלּע, "like a swallow, a gulp," is probably a proverbial expression,
according to the analogy of [Job 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019.md),
for "a single instant," of which the Arabic also furnishes examples (see
A. Schultens on [Job 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019).md). The Sept.
rendering, ἐξάπινα, conveys the actual sense. A historical illustration
of [Num 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#020.md) is furnished by [Sa1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#019.md).

(Note: According to Knobel, [Num
4:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#017.md) have been interpolated by the
Jehovist into the Elohistic text. But the reasons for this assumption
are weak throughout. Neither the peculiar use of the word shebet, to
which there is no corresponding parallel in the whole of the Old
Testament, nor the construction of נגשׁ with את, which is only met with
in [Sa1 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#018.md) and [Sa1
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#021.md), nor the Hiphil הכרית, can be
regarded as criteria of a Jehovistic usage. And the assertion, that the
Elohist lays the emphasis upon approaching and touching the holy things
([Num 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015.md); [Num
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019.md); [Num
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#003.md), [Num
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#022).md), and not upon seeing or looking
at them, rests upon an antithesis which is arbitrarily forced upon the
text, since not only seeing ([Num
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#020).md), but touching also ([Num
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#019).md), is described as causing death;
so that seeing and touching form no antithesis at all.)

[Numbers 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 4:21</span></span>

The service of the Gershonites is introduced in [Num
4:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#021.md) in the same manner as that of
the Kohathites in [Num 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#001.md); and in
[Num 4:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#024.md) it is described in
accordance with the brief notice and explanation already given in [Num
3:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#024.md).

[Numbers 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 4:27</span></span>

Their service was to be performed "according to the mouth (i.e.,
according to the appointment) of Aaron and his sons, with regard to all
their carrying (all that they were to carry), and all their doing." -
"And ye (the priests) shall appoint to them for attendance (in charge)
all their carrying," i.e., all the things they were to carry. בּמשׁמרת
פּקד, to give into keeping. The combination of פּקד with בּ and the
accusative of the object is analogous to בּ נתן, to give into a persons'
hand, in [Gen 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#017.md); and there is no
satisfactory reason for any such emendations of the text as Knobel
proposes.

[Numbers 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 4:28</span></span>

"Their charge (mishmereth) is in the hand of Ithamar," i.e., is to be
carried out under his superintendence (cf. [Exo
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021).md).

[Numbers 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 4:29</span></span>

Service of the Merarites. - [Num 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#029.md)
and [Num 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#030.md), like [Num
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#022.md) and [Num
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#023.md). פּקד, to muster, i.e., to
number, equivalent to ראשׁ נשׁא, to take the number.

[Numbers 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 4:31</span></span>

[Num 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#031.md) and [Num
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#032.md), like [Num
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#036.md) and [Num
3:37](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#037.md). "The charge of their burden"
(their carrying), i.e., the things which it was their duty to carry.

[Numbers 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 4:32</span></span>

לכל־כּליהם: with regard to all their instruments, i.e., all the things
used for setting up, fastening, or undoing the beams, bolts, etc.; see
[Num 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#036.md) and [Exo
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#019.md).

[Numbers 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 4:34</span></span>

Completion of the prescribed mustering, and statement of the number of
men qualified for service in the three Levitical families: viz., 2750
Kohathites, 2630 Gershonites, and 3200 Merarites - in all, 8580 Levites
fit for service: a number which bears a just proportion to the total
number of male Levites of a month old and upwards, viz., 22,000.

[Numbers 4:49](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">num 4:49</span></span>

"According to the commandment of Jehovah, they appointed them through
the hand of Moses (i.e., under his direction), each one to his service,
and his burden, and his mustered things (פּקדיו), i.e., the things
assigned to him at the time of the mustering as his special charge (see
[Exo 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021).md).
