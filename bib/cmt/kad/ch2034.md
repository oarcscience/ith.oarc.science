Reign of Josiah - 2 Chronicles 34-35

The account of Josiah in the Chronicle agrees in all essential points
with the representation in 2 Kings 22 and 23, but is chronologically
more exact, and in many parts more complete than that. In the second
book of Kings, the whole reform of the cultus carried out by Josiah is
viewed in its connection with the discovery of the book of the law, on
the occasion of the temple being repaired; and the narrative comprehends
not only the repair of the temple, the discovery, the reading of the
book of the law before the assembled people, and the renewal of the
covenant, but also the extirpation of idolatry in Jerusalem and Judah
and in all the cities of Israel, and the celebration of the passover in
the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign; see the introductory remarks to 2
Kings 22. In the Chronicle, on the contrary, these events are more kept
apart, and described according to their order in time. As early as in
the eighth year of his reign, Josiah, still a youth, began to seek the
God of his ancestor David, and in his twelfth year to purge Jerusalem
and Judah of idolatry ([Ch2 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003).md). In
the eighteenth year the book of the law was discovered in the temple,
brought to the king, and read before him ([Ch2
34:8-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008).md); whereupon he, deeply moved
by the contents of the book which had been read, and by the answer of
the prophetess Huldah when inquired of concerning it ([Ch2
34:19-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#019).md), went into the temple with
the elders of the people, caused the law to be read to the whole people,
and made a covenant before the Lord to obey the law ([Ch2
34:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#029).md). He then caused all the
idolatrous abominations which were still to be found in the land of
Israel to be removed ([Ch2 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#033).md), and
prepared to hold the passover, as it had not been held since the days of
Solomon (2 Chron 35:1-19). In other respects the main difference between
the two accounts is, that in 2 Kings the suppression of idolatry is
narrated with greater minuteness; the passover, on the contrary, being
only briefly noticed; - while in the Chronicle the purification of
Jerusalem, Judah, and the kingdom of Israel is shortly summarized ([Ch2
34:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003).md), but the celebration of the
passover is minutely described on its ceremonial side (2 Chron 35:1-19).

[2 Chronicles 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 34:1</span></span>

Duration and spirit of Josiah's reign; agreeing with [Kg2
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001.md), [Kg2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#002.md), only the note as to Josiah's
mother being here omitted.

[2 Chronicles 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 34:3</span></span>

Extirpation of idolatry. In the eighth year of his reign, while he was
yet a youth, being then only sixteen years old, Josiah began to seek the
God of his ancestor David, and in the twelfth year of his reign he
commenced to purify Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, Asherim,
etc. The cleansing of the land of Judah from the numerous objects of
idolatry is summarily described in [Ch2
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004.md) and [Ch2
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#005.md); and thereupon there follows
([Ch2 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006.md) and [Ch2
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#007).md) the destruction of the
idolatrous altars and images in the land of Israel, - all that it seemed
necessary to say on that subject being thus mentioned at once. For that
all this was not accomplished in the twelfth year is clear from the לטהר
החל, "he commenced to cleanse," and is moreover attested by [Ch2
34:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#033.md). The description of this
destruction of the various objects of idolatry is rhetorically
expressed, only carved and cast images being mentioned, besides the
altars of the high places and the Asherim, without the enumeration of
the different kings of idolatry which we find in 2 Kings 23:4-20. - On
[Ch2 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004.md), cf. [Ch2
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md). ינתּציּ, they pulled down before
him, i.e., under his eye, or his oversight, the altars of the Baals
(these are the בּמות, [Ch2 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003).md); and
the sun-pillars (cf. [Ch2 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#004).md) which
stood upwards, i.e., above, upon the altars, he caused to be hewn away
from them (מעליהם); the Asherim (pillars and trees of Asherah) and the
carved and molten images to be broken and ground (הדק, cf. [Ch2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016)), and (the dust of them.md) to be
strewn upon the graves (of those) who had sacrificed to them. הזּבחים is
connected directly with הקּברים, so that the actions of those buried in
them are poetically attributed to the graves. In [Kg2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006.md) this is said only of the ashes of
the Asherah statue which was burnt, while here it is rhetorically
generalized.

[2 Chronicles 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 34:5</span></span>

And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, i.e., he caused
the bones of the idolatrous priests to be taken from their graves and
burnt on the spot where the destroyed altars had stood, that he might
defile the place with the ashes of the dead. In these words is
summarized what is stated in [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013.md) and [Kg2
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#014.md) as to the defilement of the
places of sacrifice built upon the Mount of Olives by the bones of the
dead, and in [Kg2 23:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016.md) as to the
burning of the bones of the high priests of Bethel, after they had been
taken from their graves, upon their own altars. מזבחותים is an
orthographical error for מזבּחותם.

[2 Chronicles 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 34:6</span></span>

[Ch2 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006.md) and [Ch2
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#007.md) form a connected sentence: And in
the cities of Manasseh ..., in their ruins round about, there he pulled
down the altars, etc. The tribe of Simeon is here, as in [Ch2
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009.md), reckoned among the tribes of the
kingdom of Israel, because the Simeonites, although they belonged
geographically to the kingdom of Judah, yet in religion remained
attached to the worship on the high places practised by the ten tribes;
see on [Ch2 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009.md). "And unto Naphtali"
is added, to designate the kingdom of Israel in its whole extent to the
northern frontier of Canaan. The form בתיהם בּחר (in the Keth. divided
into two words) gives no suitable sense. R. Sal. explains, timentes in
planitie habitare, sed fixerunt in monte domicilia, rendering it "in
their mountain-dwellings." This the words cannot mean.

(Note: The lxx translate ἐν τοῖς τόποις αὐτῶν, expressing merely the
בתיהם. The Targ. has צדיוּתהון בבית, in domo (s. loco) desolationis
eorum.)

The Keri בּחרבתיהם, "with their swords," is suggested by [Eze
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#009.md), and is accepted by D. Kimchi,
Abu Melech, and others, and understood to denote instruments with which
the altars, groves, and images were cut down. But this interpretation
also is certainly incorrect. The word is rather to be pointed בּחרבתיהם,
in their wastes (ruins) (cf. [Psa
109:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#010).md), and to be taken as an
explanatory apposition to בּערי: in the cities of Manasseh ..., namely,
in their ruins round about; for the land had been deserted since the
times of Shalmaneser, and its cities were in great part in ruins. The
statement as to the locality precedes in the form of an absolute
sentence, and that which is predicated of it follows in the form of an
apodosis with ו consec. (וינתּץ). להדק כּתּת, he dashed to pieces to
crush; the form הדק is not a perfect after ל, but an infinitive which
has retained the vowel of the perfect; cf. Ew. 238, d.

[2 Chronicles 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 34:8</span></span>

The cleansing and repairing of the temple, and the finding of the book
of the law. Cf. [Kg2 22:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003.md). - In the
eighteenth year of his reign, when he was purging the land and the house
(of God), he sent. לטהר does not indeed signify "after the purging" (De
Wette, with the older expositors), but still less is it a statement of
the object, "to purge" (Berth.); for that is decisively disposed of both
by its position at the beginning of the sentence, where no statement of
the object would stand, but still more by the fact that a statement of
the object follows, וגו לחזּק. ל used of time denotes "about," and so
with the inf., e.g., [Jer 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md) : at
(his) coming = when he came. Shaphan was סופר, state secretary,
according to [Kg2 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003.md). With him the
king sent the governor of the city Maaseiah, and the chancellor Joah.
These two are not mentioned in [Kg2
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003.md), but have not been arbitrarily
added by the chronicler, or invented by him, as Then. groundlessly
supposes. "To repair the house of Jahve." What these high royal
officials had to do with it we learn from what follows.

[Ch2 34:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#009.md)

They, together with the high priest, gave the money which had been
received for the repair of the temple to the overseers of the building,
who then gave it to workmen to procure building materials and for wages,
just as was done when the temple was repaired by Joash, [Ch2
24:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#011.md). The Keri ויּשׁבוּ is a
correction resulting from a misinterpretation of the Keth. וישׁבי, "and
of the dwellers in Jerusalem." The enumeration, "from the hand of
Manasseh, Ephraim," etc., is rhetorical. In ויּתּנוּ, [Ch2
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#010.md), the verb of [Ch2
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#009.md) is again taken up: they handed it
to the overseers of the building, and they to the workmen. הם עשׂה is a
rare form of the plur. עשׁי; see on [Ch1
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md). The overseers of the building
(המפקדים - עשׁי) are the subject of the second ויּתּנוּ; and before the
following עשׂי ל, which stands in 2 Kings, is to be supplied. בדוק is a
denom. from בּדק, and signifies to repair what has been damaged. The
statement of [Ch2 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#010.md) is made more
definite by [Ch2 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#011.md) : they gave it,
namely, to the workers in stone and wood, and to the builders to buy
hewn stones and timber for couplings, and for the beams of the houses
(לקרות, to provide with beams; הבּתים are the various buildings of the
temple and its courts), which the kings of Judah had allowed to decay
(השׁחית, not of designed destroying, but of ruining by neglect). - In
[Ch2 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#012.md) we have still the remark
that the people did the work with fidelity, and the money could
consequently be given to them without reckoning, cf. [Kg2
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#007.md); and then the names of the
building inspectors follow. Two Levites of the family of Merari, and two
of the family of Kohath, were overseers; לנצּח, i.e., to lead in the
building, to preside over it as upper overseers; and besides them, the
Levites, all who were skilled in instruments of song (cf. [Ch1
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#006)..md). As men who by their office and
their art occupied a conspicuous place among the Levites, the oversight
of the workmen in the temple was committed to them, not "that they might
incite and cheer the workmen by music and song" (Berth.).

[Ch2 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#013.md)

[Ch2 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#013.md) is probably to be taken,
along with [Ch2 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#012.md), in the
signification, "All the Levites who were skilled in music were over the
bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all the workmen in reference
to every work." The ו before הס על appears certainly to go against this
interpretation, and Berth. would consequently erase it to connect
הסּבּלים על with the preceding verse, and begin a new sentence with
וּמנצּחים: "and they led all the workmen." But if we separate וּמנצּחים
from הסּבּלים על, this mention of the bearers of burdens (סבלים) comes
awkwardly in between the subject and the predicate, or the statement as
to the subject. We hold the text to be correct, and make the w before הס
על correspond to the ו before מנצחים, in the signification, et - et. The
Levites, all who were skilled in instruments of song, were both over the
bearers of burdens, and overseeing the workmen, or leading the workmen.
Besides, of the Levites were, i.e., still other Levites were, scribes
and officers and porters, i.e., were busied about the temple in the
discharge of these functions.

[Ch2 34:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#014.md)

In bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of the
Lord, the high priest found the book of Moses' law. It is not clearly
implied in the words, that he found it in the place where the money was
laid up. The book of the law which was found is merely characterized as
the book of the Mosaic law by the words בּיד־משׁה, not necessarily as
Moses' autograph. The communication of this discovery by the high priest
to the state secretary Shaphan, and by him to the king, is narrated in
[Ch2 34:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#015.md), just as in [Kg2
22:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008.md). The statement, [Ch2
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#016.md), "And Shaphan brought the book
to the king," instead of the words, "and Shaphan the ספר came (went) to
the king," involves no difference as to the facts; it rather makes the
matter clear. For since in [Kg2 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#010.md),
immediately after the statement that Hilkiah gave him the book, it is
said that Shaphan read from it to the king, he must have brought it to
the king. With this elucidation, both the omission of ויּקראהוּ ([Kg2
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008).md), and the insertion of עוד after
ויּשׁב, [Ch2 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#016.md), is connected. The
main thing, that which it concerned the author of the Chronicle to
notice, was the fact that the book of the law which had been discovered
was immediately brought and read to the king; while the circumstance
that Shaphan, when the book was given him, also opened it and read in
it, is omitted, as it had no further results. But since Shaphan did not
go to the king merely to bring him the book, but rather, in the first
place, to report upon the performance of the commission entrusted to him
in respect of the money, this report required to be brought prominently
forward by the עוד: He brought the book to the king, and besides, made
his report to the king. All that has been committed to thy servants
(בּיד נתן), that they do; they have poured out the money, etc. The עבדים
are not Shaphan and the others mentioned in [Ch2
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008.md), but in general those who were
entrusted with the oversight of the repair of the temple, among whom,
indeed, the chief royal officials were not included. After this report
there follows in [Ch2 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#018.md) an account
of the book which Shaphan had brought, and which, as we were informed in
[Ch2 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#016.md), in anticipation of the
event, he gave to the king.

[2 Chronicles 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 34:19</span></span>

The dismay of the king at the contents of the book which was read to
him, and his inquiry of the prophetess Huldah as to the judgments
threatened in the law. - Compare with this the parallel account in [Kg2
22:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#011.md), with the commentary there
given, as both accounts agree with the exception of some unimportant
variations in expression. Instead of Abdon ben Micah ([Ch2
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#020).md) we find in 2 Kings Achbor ben
Micayahu, perhaps the correct reading. In [Ch2
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#021.md), the expression, "and for those
that are left in Israel and Judah," i.e., for the remainder of the
people who were left in Israel after the destruction of the kingdom, and
in Judah after the divine chastisements inflicted, mainly by the
Assyrians under Hezekiah and Manasseh, is clearer and more significant
than that in [Kg2 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#013.md), "and for the
people, and for all Judah." נתּכה, to pour itself forth (of anger), is
quite as suitable as נצּתה, inflame, kindle itself, in [Kg2
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#013.md). In [Ch2
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#022.md), those sent with the high priest
Hilkiah are briefly designated by the words המּלך ואשׁר, and whom the
king, scil. had sent; in [Kg2 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md),
on the contrary, the individual names are recorded (Ewald, Gramm. 292,
b, would supply אמר, after the lxx). The names of the ancestors of the
prophetess Huldah also are somewhat different. כּזאת, as the king had
said to him, is omitted in 2 Kings. - In [Ch2
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#024.md), כּל־האלות, all the curses, is
more significant than כּל־דּברי, [Kg2
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#016.md). ותּתּך ([Ch2
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#025).md) is a statement of the result of
the עזבוּני: Because they have forsaken me, my anger pours itself forth.
In [Ch2 34:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#027.md), the rhetorical
expansion of the words which God had spoken of Jerusalem in the law, וגו
לשׁמּה להיות, inserted in [Kg2 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#019.md)
as an elucidation, are omitted. After the preceding designation of these
words as "the curses written in the law," any further elucidation was
superfluous. On the contents of the saying of the prophetess Huldah, see
the commentary on [Kg2 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#016.md).

[2 Chronicles 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch2 34:29</span></span>

The reading of the book of the law in the temple, and the solemn renewal
of the covenant, to which the king assembled the elders of Judah and
Jerusalem, with all the people, after the saying of the prophetess
Huldah had been reported to him, are recorded in [Kg2
23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001.md) as they are in the Chronicle,
and have been commented upon at the former passage. Only [Ch2
34:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#032.md), the contents of which
correspond to the words, "And the whole people entered into the
covenant" ([Kg2 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003).md), will need
explanation. ויּעמד is usually translated, "he caused the people to
enter into the covenant" (after 2 Kings). This is in substance correct,
but exegetically cannot be defended, since בּבּרית does not precede, so
as to allow of its here being supplied from the context. ויּעמד only
signifies, he caused all who were in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand,
and they did according to the covenant of God; whence we can easily
supply in the first clause, "and to do according to the covenant." The
collocation, "in Jerusalem and in Benjamin," is an abbreviation of the
complete formula, "in Jerusalem and Judah and Benjamin;" then in the
following clause only the inhabitants of Jerusalem are named as
representatives of the inhabitants of the whole kingdom.

[2 Chronicles 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch2 34:33</span></span>

But not only his own subjects did Josiah induce to act towards God in
accordance with the covenant; in all the districts of the sons of Israel
he removed the idolatrous abominations, and compelled every one in
Israel to serve Jahve. The "sons of Israel," as distinguished from the
inhabitants of Jerusalem and Benjamin ([Ch2
34:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#032).md), are the remnant of the ten
tribes in their land, where Josiah, according to [Ch2
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006.md)., had also destroyed the
idolatrous places of worship and the images. The statement in our verse,
with which the account of Josiah's cultus reform is concluded, refers to
that. לעבד ויּעבד, he made to serve, compelled them to serve. By the
abolition of idolatry he compelled them to worship Jahve. The last words
of the verse are accordingly to be interpreted as signifying that
Josiah, so long as he lived, allowed no open idolatry, but externally
maintained the worship of Jahve. These measures could not effect a real,
heartfelt conversion to God, and so the people fell again into open
idolatry immediately after Josiah's death; and Jeremiah continually
complains of the defection and corruption of Judah and Israel: cf. [Ch2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001.md), [Ch2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001.md), [Ch2
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001.md), etc.
