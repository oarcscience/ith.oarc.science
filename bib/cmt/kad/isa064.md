### [Isaiah Chapter 64](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 64:1</span></span>

The similes which follow cannot be attached to this nâzōllū, however we
may explain it. Yet [Isa 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001) (2.md) does
not form a new and independent sentence; but we must in thought repeat
the word upon which the principal emphasis rests in [Isa
63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019.md) ([Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001)). "(Wouldst come down.md) as fire
kindles brushwood, fire causes water to boil; to make known Thy name to
Thine adversaries, that the heathen may tremble before Thy face! When
Thou doest terrible things which we hoped not for; wouldst come down,
(and) mountains shake before Thy countenance!" The older expositors gave
themselves a great deal of trouble in the attempt to trace hămâsı̄m to
mâsas, to melt. But since Louis de Dieu and Albert Schultens have
followed Saadia and Abulwlid in citing the Arabic hms, to crack, to
mutter, to mumble, etc., and hšm, to break in pieces, confringere, from
which comes hashim, broken, dry wood, it is generally admitted that
hămâsim is from hemes (lit. crackling, rattling, Arab. hams), and
signifies "dry twigs," arida sarmenta. The second simile might be
rendered, "as water bubbles up in the fire;" and in that case mayim
would be treated as a feminine (according to the rule in Ges. 146, 3),
in support of which [Job 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019.md) may be
adduced as an unquestionable example (although in other cases it is
masculine), and אשׁ = בּאשׁ would be used in a local sense, like
lehâbhâh, into flames, in [Isa 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md).
But it is much more natural to take אשׁ, which is just as often a
feminine as מים is a masculine, as the subject of תּבעה, and to give to
the verb בּעה, which is originally intransitive, judging from the Arabic
bgâ, to swell, the Chald. בּוּע, to spring up (compare אבעבּעות,
blisters, pustules), the Syr. בּגא, to bubble up, etc., the transitive
meaning to cause to boil or bubble up, rather than the intransitive to
boil (comp. [Isa 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#013.md), נבעה, swollen
= bent forwards, as it were protumidus). Jehovah is to come down with
the same irresistible force which fire exerts upon brushwood or water,
when it sets the former in flames and makes the latter boil; in order
that by such a display of might He may make His name known (viz., the
name thus judicially revealing itself, hence "in fire," [Isa
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md); [Isa
66:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015).md) to His adversaries, and that
nations (viz., those that are idolaters) may tremble before Him (מפּניך:
cf., [Psa 68:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002).md). The infinitive
clause denoting the purpose, like that indicating the comparison, passes
into the finite (cf., [Isa 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#002.md); [Isa
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009.md); [Isa
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025).md). Modern commentators for the
most part now regard the optative lū' (O that) as extending to [Isa
64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002.md) also; and, in fact, although this
continued influence of lū' appears to overstep the bounds of the
possible, we are forced to resort to this extremity. [Isa
64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002.md) cannot contain a historical
retrospect: the word "formerly" would be introduced if it did, and the
order of the words would be a different one. Again, we cannot assume
that נזלּוּ הרים מפּניך ירדתּ contains an expression of confidence, or
that the prefects indicate certainty. Neither the context, the foregoing
נוראות בּעשׂותך נו (why not עשׂה?), nor the parenthetical assertion
נקוּה לא, permits of this. On the other hand, וגו בעשׂותך connects
itself very appropriately with the purposes indicated in [Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001) (2..md): "may tremble when Thou
doest terrible things, which we, i.e., such as we, do not look for,"
i.e., which surpass our expectations. And now nothing remains but to
recognise the resumption of [Isa 63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019.md)
([Isa 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001).md) in the clause "The
mountains shake at Thy presence," in which case Isaiah 63:19b-64:2 ([Isa
64:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001).md) forms a grand period rounded
off palindromically after Isaiah's peculiar style.

[Isaiah 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 64:3</span></span>

The following clause gives the reason for this; ו being very frequently
the logical equivalent for kı̄ (e.g., [Isa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#007.md) and [Isa
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015).md). The justification of this
wish, which is forced from them by the existing misery, is found in the
incomparable acts of Jehovah for the good of His own people, which are
to be seen in a long series of historical events. [Isa
64:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003) (4..md). "For from olden time men
have not heard, nor perceived, nor hath an eye seen, a God beside Thee,
who acted on behalf of him that waiteth for Him." No ear, no eye has
ever been able to perceive the existence of a God who acted like
Jehovah, i.e., really interposed on behalf of those who set their hopes
upon Him. This is the explanation adopted by Knobel; but he wrongly
supplies נוראות to יעשׂה, whereas עשׂה is used here in the same pregnant
sense as in Ps. 22:32; [Psa 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005.md);
52:11 (cf., gâmar in [Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md); [Psa
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008).md). It has been objected to this
explanation, that האזין is never connected with the accusative of the
person, and that God can neither be heard nor seen. But what is terrible
in relation to שׁמע in [Job 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005.md)
cannot be untenable in relation to האזין. Hearing and seeing God are
here equivalent to recognising His existence through the perception of
His works. The explanation favoured by Rosenmller and Stier, viz., "And
from olden time men have not heard it, nor perceived with ears, no eye
has seen it, O God, beside Thee, what (this God) doth to him that
waiteth for Him," is open to still graver objections. The thought is the
same as in [Psa 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020.md), and when so
explained it corresponds more exactly to the free quotation in [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md), which with our explanation there
is no necessity to trace back to either [Isa
42:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#015.md), or a lost book, as Origen
imagined (see Tischendorf's ed. vii. of the N.T. on this passage). This
which no ear has heard, no eye seen, is not God Himself, but He who acts
for His people, and justifies their waiting for Him (cf., Hofmann, Die
h. Schrift Neuen Testaments, ii. 2, 51). Another proof that Paul had no
other passage than this in his mind, is the fact that the same quotation
is met with in Clement's Epistle to the Corinthians (ch. 34), where,
instead of "those that love Him," we have "those that wait for Him," a
literal rendering of למחכּה־לו. The quotation by Paul therefore by no
means leads us to take Elohim as a vocative or וגו יעשׂה as the object,
although it must not be concealed that this view of the passage and its
reference to the fulness of glory in the eternal life is an old
rabbinical one, as Rashi expressly affirms, when he appeals to R. Jose
(Joseph Kara) as bondsman for the other (see b. Sanhedrin 99a). Hahn has
justly objected to this traditional explanation, which regards Elohim as
a vocative, that the thought, that God alone has heard and perceived and
seen with His eye what He intends to do to His people, is unsuitable in
itself, and at variance with the context, and that if וגו יעשׂה was
intended as the object, אשר (את) would certainly be inserted. And to
this we may add, that we cannot find the words Elohim zūlâthekhâ (God
beside Thee) preceded by a negation anywhere in chapters 40-66 without
receiving at once the impression, that they affirm the sole deity of
Jehovah (comp. [Isa 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005.md), [Isa
45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021).md). The meaning therefore is, "No
other God beside Jehovah has ever been heard or seen, who acted for
(ageret pro) those who waited for Him." Mechakkēh is the construct,
according to Ges. 116, 1; and ya‛ăsēh has tsere here, according to
Kimchi (Michlol 125b) and other testimonies, just as we meet with תעסה
four times (in [Gen 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#029.md); [Jos
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#009.md); [Sa2
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#012.md); [Jer
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#016).md) and ונעשׂה once ([Jos
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#024).md), mostly with a disjunctive
accent, and not without the influence of a whole or half pause, the form
with tsere being regarded as more emphatic than that with seghol.

(Note: In addition to the examples given above, we have the following
forms of the same kind in kal: ימּצה (with tiphchah) in [Jer
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#017); תּראה (with tsakpeh.md) in [Dan
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#013), compare תּגלּה (with athnach.md) in
[Lev 18:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007.md), and תגלּה (with the
smaller disjunctive tiphchah) in [Lev
18:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009); ינקּה (with athnach.md) in [Nah
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003); אזרה (with tsakeph.md) in [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012.md). This influence of the
accentuation has escaped the notice of the more modern grammarians
(e.g., Ges. 75, Anm. 17).)

[Isaiah 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 64:4</span></span>

After the long period governed by לוּא has thus been followed by the
retrospect in [Isa 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003) (4..md), it is
absolutely impossible that [Isa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md)
(5a) should be intended as an optative, in the sense of "O that thou
wouldst receive him that," etc., as Stier and others propose. The
retrospect is still continued thus: "Thou didst meet him that rejoiceth
to work righteousness, when they remembered Thee in Thy ways." צדק ועשׂה
שׂשׂ is one in whom joy and right action are paired, and is therefore
equivalent to לעשׂות שׂשׂ. At the same time, it may possibly be more
correct to take צדק as the object of both verses, as Hofmann does in the
sense of "those who let what is right be their joy, and their action
also;" for though שׂוּשׂ (שׂישׂ) cannot be directly construed with the
accusative of the object, as we have already observed at [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md) and [Isa
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md), it may be indirectly, as in this
passage and [Isa 65:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#018.md). On pâga‛, "to
come to meet," in the sense of "coming to the help of," see at [Isa
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003.md); it is here significantly
interchanged with בּדרכיך of the minor clause bidrâkhekhâ yizkerūkhâ,
"those who remember Thee in Thy ways" (for the syntax, compare [Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005.md) and [Isa
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016).md): "When such as love and do
right, walking in Thy ways, remembered Thee (i.e., thanked Thee for
grace received, and longed for fresh grace), Thou camest again and again
to meet them as a friend."

But Israel appeared to have been given up without hope to the wrath of
this very God. [Isa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004) (5b.md).
"Behold, Thou, Thou art enraged, and we stood as sinners there; already
have we been long in this state, and shall we be saved?" Instead of hēn
‛attâh (the antithesis of now and formerly), the passage proceeds with
hēn 'attâh. There was no necessity for 'attâh with qâtsaphtâ; so that it
is used with special emphasis: "Behold, Thou, a God who so faithfully
accepts His own people, hast broken out in wrath." The following word
ונּחטא cannot mean "and we have sinned," but is a fut. consec., and
therefore must mean at least, "then we have sinned" (the sin inferred
from the punishment). It is more correct, however, to take it, as in
[Gen 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#009.md), in the sense of, "Then we
stand as sinners, as guilty persons:" the punishment has exhibited
Israel before the world, and before itself, as what it really is
(consequently the fut. consec. does not express the logical inference,
but the practical consequence). As ונחטא has tsakeph, and therefore the
accents at any rate preclude Shelling's rendering, "and we have wandered
in those ways from the very earliest times," we must take the next two
clauses as independent, if indeed בהם is to be understood as referring
to בדרכיך. Stier only goes halfway towards this when he renders it, "And
indeed in them (the ways of God, we sinned) from of old, and should we
be helped?" This is forced, and yet not in accordance with the accents.
Rosenmller and Hahn quite satisfy this demand when they render it,
"Tamen in viis tuis aeternitas ut salvemur;" but ‛ōlâm, αἰών, in this
sense of αἰωνιότης, is not scriptural. The rendering adopted by Besser,
Grotius, and Starck is a better one: "(Si vero) in illis (viis tuis)
perpetuo (mansissemus), tunc servati fuerimus" (if we had continued in
Thy ways, then we should have been preserved). But there is no
succession of tenses here, which could warrant us in taking ונוּשׁע as a
paulo-post future; and Hofmann's view is syntactically more correct, "In
them (i.e., the ways of Jehovah) eternally, we shall find salvation,
after the time is passed in which He has been angry and we have sinned"
(or rather, been shown to be guilty). But we question the connection
between בהם and רדכיך in any form. In our view the prayer suddenly takes
a new turn from hēn (behold) onwards, just as it did with lū' (O that)
in [Isa 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md); and רדכיך in [Isa
64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md) stands at the head of a
subordinate clause. Hence בהם must refer back to ונחטא קצפת ("in Thine
anger and in our sins," Schegg). There is no necessity, however, to
search for nouns to which to refer בּהם. It is rather to be taken as
neuter, signifying "therein" ([Eze
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#018.md), cf., [Psa
90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010).md), like עליהם, thereupon =
thereby ([Isa 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016).md), בּהן therein
([Isa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016).md), מהם thereout ([Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006).md), therefrom ([Isa
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#015).md). The idea suggested by such
expressions as these is no doubt that of plurality (here a plurality of
manifestations of wrath and of sins), but one which vanishes into the
neuter idea of totality. Now we do justice both to the clause without a
verb, which, being a logical copula, admits simply of a present sumus;
and also to ‛ōlâm, which is the accusative of duration, when we explain
the sentence as meaning, "In this state we are and have been for a long
time." ‛Olâm is used in other instances in these prophecies to denote
the long continuance of the sate of punishment (see [Isa
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014.md); [Isa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011).md), since it appeared to the
exiles as an eternity (a whole aeon), and what lay beyond it as but a
little while (mits‛âr, [Isa 63:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#018).md).
The following word ונוּשׁע needs no correction. There is no necessity to
change it into ונּתע, as Ewald proposes, after the lxx καὶ ἐπλανήθημεν
("and we fell into wandering"), or what would correspond still more
closely to the lxx (cf., [Isa 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008.md),
פשׁעים, lxx πεπλανήμενοι), but is less appropriate here, into ונּפשׁע
("and we fell into apostasy"), the reading supported by Lowth and
others. If it were necessary to alter the text at all, we might simply
transpose the letters, and read וּנשׁוּע, "and cried for help." But if
we take it as a question, "And shall we experience salvation - find
help?" there is nothing grammatically inadmissible in this (compare [Isa
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028).md), and psychologically it is
commended by the state of mind depicted in [Isa
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#027.md); [Isa
59:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010.md). Moreover, what follows
attaches itself quite naturally to this.

[Isaiah 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 64:5</span></span>

\(6\)

The people who ask the question in [Isa
64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md) do not regard themselves as
worthy of redemption, as their self-righteousness has been so thoroughly
put to shame. "We all became like the unclean thing, and all our virtues
like a garment soiled with blood; and we all faded away together like
the leaves; and our iniquities, like the storm they carried us away."
The whole nation is like one whom the law pronounces unclean, like a
leper, who has to cry "tâmē, tâmē "as he goes along, that men may get
out of his way ([Lev 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045).md). Doing
right in all its manifold forms (tsedâqōth, like [Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md), used elsewhere of the
manifestations of divine righteousness), which once made Israel
well-pleasing to God ([Isa 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021).md), has
disappeared and become like a garment stained with menstruous discharge
(cf., [Eze 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017).md); (lxx ὡς ῥάκος
ἀποκαθημένης = dâvâ, [Isa 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022.md);
niddâh, [Lam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017.md); temē'âh, [Lev
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#033).md). ‛Iddı̄m (used thus in the
plural in the Talmud also) signifies the monthly period (menstrua). In
the third figure, that of fading falling foliage, the form vannâbhel is
not kal (= vannibbōl or vannibbal; Ewald, 232, b), which would be an
impossibility according to the laws of inflexion; still less is it
niphal = vanninnâbhel (which Kimchi suggests as an alternative); but
certainly a hiphil. It is not, however, from nâbhēl = vannabbel, "with
the reduplication dropped to express the idea of something gradual," as
Bttcher proposes (a new and arbitrary explanation in the place of one
founded upon the simple laws of inflexion), but either from bâlal
(compare the remarks on belı̄l in [Isa
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#024.md), which hardly signifies "ripe
barley" however), after the form ויּגל (from גּלל) ויּסך (from סכך), or
from būl, after the form ויּקם, etc. In any case, therefore, it is a
metaplastic formation, whether from bâlal or būl = nâbhēl, like ויּשׂר
(in [Ch1 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#003.md), after the form ויּסר,
from שּׂור = נשׂר, or after the form ויּרע, from שׂרר = נשׂר (compare
the rabbinical explanation of the name of the month Bul from the falling
of the leaves, in Buxtorf, Lex. talm. col. 271). The hiphil הבל or הביל
is to be compared to האדים, to stream out red (= to be red); האריך, to
make an extension (= to be long); השׁרישׁ, to strike root (= to root),
etc., and signifies literally to produce a fading (= to fade away). In
the fourth figure, עוננוּ (as it is also written in [Isa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006) according to correct codices.md) is
a defective plural (as in [Jer 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007.md);
[Eze 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#018.md); [Dan
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#013).md) for the more usual עונתינוּ
([Isa 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012).md). עון is the usual term
applied to sin regarded as guilt, which produces punishment of itself.
The people were robbed by their sins of all vital strength and energy,
like dry leaves, which the guilt and punishment springing from sin
carried off as a very easy prey.

[Isaiah 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 64:6</span></span>

Universal forgetfulness of God was the consequence of this
self-instigated departure from God. "And there was no one who called
upon Thy name, who aroused himself to lay firm hold of Thee: for Thou
hadst hidden Thy face from us, and didst melt us into the hand of our
transgressions." There was no one (see [Isa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016).md) who had risen up in prayer and
intercession out of this deep fall, or had shaken himself out of the
sleep of security and lethargy of insensibility, to lay firm hold of
Jehovah, i.e., not to let Him go till He blessed him and his people
again. The curse of God pressed every one down; God had withdrawn His
grace from them, and given them up to the consequences of their sins.
The form ותּמוּגנוּ is not softened from the pilel ותּמגגנוּ, but is a
kal like ויכוּננּוּ ekil in [Job 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015.md)
(which see), מוּג being used in a transitive sense, as kūn is there
(cf., shūbh, [Isa 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md); mūsh, [Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009).md). The lxx, Targ., and Syr. render
it et tradidisti nos; but we cannot conclude from this with any
certainty that they read ותּמגּננוּ, which Knobel follows Ewald in
correcting into the incorrect form ותּמגּנּוּ. The prophet himself had
the expression miggēn beyad ([Gen
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#020.md), cf., [Job
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#004).md) in his mind, in the sense of
liquefecisti nos in manum, equivalent to liquefecisti et tradidisti
(παρέδωκας, [Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028).md), from which it
is evident that ביד is not a mere διά (lxx), but the "hand" of the
transgressions is their destructive and damning power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 64:7</span></span>

(8-9)

This was the case when the measure of Israel's sins had become full.
They were carried into exile, where they sank deeper and deeper. The
great mass of the people proved themselves to be really massa perdita,
and perished among the heathen. But there were some, though a
vanishingly small number, who humbled themselves under the mighty hand
of God, and, when redemption could not be far off, wrestled in such
prayers as these, that the nation might share it in its entirety, and if
possible not one be left behind. With ועתּה the existing state of sin
and punishment is placed among the things of the past, and the petition
presented that the present moment of prayer may have all the
significance of a turning-point in their history. "And now, O Jehovah,
Thou art our Father: we are the clay, and Thou our Maker; and we are all
the work of Thy hand. Be not extremely angry, O Jehovah, and remember
not the transgression for ever! Behold, consider, we beseech Thee, we
are all Thy people." The state of things must change at last; for Israel
is an image made by Jehovah; yea, more than this, Jehovah is the
begetter of Israel, and loves Israel not merely as a sculptor, but as a
father (compare [Isa 45:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009.md), and the
unquestionable passage of Isaiah in [Isa
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016).md). Let Him then not be angry
עד־מאד, "to the utmost measure" (cf., [Psa
119:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#008).md), or if we paraphrase it
according to the radical meaning of מד, "till the weight becomes
intolerable." Let Him not keep in mind the guilt for ever, to punish it;
but, in consideration of the fact that Israel is the nation of His
choice, let mercy take the place of justice. הן strengthens the petition
in its own way (see [Gen 30:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#034).md), just
as נא does; and הבּיט signifies here, as elsewhere, to fix the eye upon
anything. The object, in this instance, is the existing fact expressed
in "we are all Thy people." Hitzig is correct in regarding the
repetition of "all of us" in this prayer as significant. The object
throughout is to entreat that the whole nation may participate in the
inheritance of the coming salvation, in order that the exodus from
Babylonia may resemble the exodus from Egypt.

[Isaiah 64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 64:9</span></span>

The re-erection of the ruins of the promised land requires the zeal of
every one, and this state of ruin must not continue. It calls out the
love and faithfulness of Jehovah. "The cities of Thy holiness have
become a pasture-ground; Zion has become a pasture-ground, Jerusalem a
desert. The house of our holiness and of our adorning, where our fathers
praised Thee, is given up to the fire, and everything that was our
delight given up to devastation. Wilt Thou restrain Thyself in spite of
this, O Jehovah, be silent, and leave us to suffer the utmost?"
Jerusalem by itself could not possibly be called "cities" (‛ârē), say
with reference to the upper and lower cities (Vitringa). It is merely
mentioned by name as the most prominent of the many cities which were
all "holy cities," inasmuch as the whole of Canaan was the land of
Jehovah ([Isa 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025).md), and His holy
territory ([Psa 78:54](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#054).md). The word
midbâr (pasture-land, heath, different from tsiyyâh, the pastureless
desert, [Isa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001).md) is repeated, for
the purpose of showing that the same fate had fallen upon Zion-Jerusalem
as upon the rest of the cities of the land. The climax of the terrible
calamity was the fact, that the temple had also fallen a prey to the
burning of the fire (compare for the fact, [Jer
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013).md). The people call it "house of
our holiness and of our glory." Jehovah's qōdesh and tiph'ereth have, as
it were, transplanted heaven to earth in the temple (compare [Isa
63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md) with [Isa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007).md); and this earthly dwelling-place
of God is Israel's possession, and therefore Israel's qōdesh and
tiph'ereth. The relative clause describes what sublime historical
reminiscences are attached to the temple: אשׁר is equivalent to שׁם
אשׁר, as in [Gen 39:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#020.md); [Num
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013.md) (compare [Psa
84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004).md), [Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md), etc. הללּך has chateph-pathach,
into which, as a rule, the vocal sheva under the first of two similar
letters is changed. Machămaddēnū (our delights) may possibly include
favourite places, ornamental buildings, and pleasure grounds; but the
parallel leads us rather to think primarily of things associated with
the worship of God, in which the people found a holy delight. כל,
contrary to the usual custom, is here followed by the singular of the
predicate, as in [Pro 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002.md); [Eze
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015.md) (cf., [Gen
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#029).md). Will Jehovah still put
restraint upon Himself, and cause His merciful love to keep silence,
על־זאת, with such a state of things as this, or notwithstanding this
state of things ([Job 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#007).md)? On
התאפּק, see [Isa 63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md); [Isa
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014.md). The suffering would indeed
increase עד־מאד (to the utmost), if it caused the destruction of Israel,
or should not be followed at last by Israel's restoration. Jehovah's
compassion cannot any longer thus forcibly restrain itself; it must
break forth, like Joseph's tears in the recognition scene ([Gen
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#001).md).
