### [Exodus Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 33:1</span></span>

Moses' negotiations with the people, for the purpose of bringing them to
sorrow and repentance, commenced with the announcement of what Jehovah
had said. The words of Jehovah in [Exo
33:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001.md), which are only a still further
expansion of the assurance contained in [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md), commence in a similar manner to
the covenant promise in [Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md),
[Exo 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023.md); but there is this great
difference, that whereas the name, i.e., the presence of Jehovah
Himself, was to have gone before the Israelites in the angel promised to
the people as a leader in [Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md),
now, though Jehovah would still send an angel before Moses and Israel,
He Himself would not go up to Canaan (a land flowing, etc., see at [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008).md) in the midst of Israel, lest He
should destroy the people by the way, because they were stiff-necked
(אכלך for אכלך, see Ges. 27, 3, Anm. 2).

[Exodus 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 33:4</span></span>

The people were so overwhelmed with sorrow by this evil word, that they
all put off their ornaments, and showed by this outward sign the trouble
of their heart,

[Exodus 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 33:5</span></span>

That this good beginning of repentance might lead to a true and
permanent change of heart, Jehovah repeated His threat in a most
emphatic manner: "Thou art a stiff-necked people; if I go a moment in
the midst of thee, I destroy thee:" i.e., if I were to go up in the
midst of thee for only a single moment, I should be compelled to destroy
thee because of thine obduracy. He then issued this command: "Throw
thine ornament away from thee, and I shall know (by that) what to do to
thee."

[Exodus 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 33:6</span></span>

And the people obeyed this commandment, renouncing all that pleased the
eye. "The children of Israel spoiled themselves (see at [Exo
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#036).md) of their ornament from Mount
Horeb onwards." Thus they entered formally into a penitential condition.
The expression, "from Mount Horeb onwards," can hardly be paraphrased as
it is by Seb. Schmidt, viz., "going from Mount Horeb into the camp," but
in all probability expresses this idea, that from that time forward,
i.e., after the occurrence of this event at Horeb, they laid aside the
ornaments which they had hitherto worn, and assumed the outward
appearance of perpetual penitence.

[Exodus 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 33:7</span></span>

Moses then took a tent, and pitched it outside the camp, at some
distance off, and called it "tent of meeting." The "tent" is neither the
sanctuary of the tabernacle described in Ex 25., which was not made till
after the perfect restoration of the covenant (Ex 35.), nor another
sanctuary that had come down from their forefathers and was used before
the tabernacle was built, as Clericus, J. D. Michaelis, Rosenmller, and
others suppose; but a tent belonging to Moses, which was made into a
temporary sanctuary by the fact that the pillar of cloud came down upon
it, and Jehovah talked with Moses there, and which was called by the
same name as the tabernacle, viz., מועד אחל (see at [Exo
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021).md), because Jehovah revealed
Himself there, and every one who sought Him had to go to this tent
outside the camp. There were two reasons for this: in the first place,
Moses desired thereby to lead the people to a fuller recognition of
their separation from their God, that their penitence might be deepened
in consequence; and in the second place, he wished to provide such means
of intercourse with Jehovah as would not only awaken in the minds of the
people a longing for the renewal of the covenant, but render the
restoration of the covenant possible. And this end was answered. Not
only did every one who sought Jehovah go out to the tent, but the whole
nation looked with the deepest reverence when Moses went out to the
tent, and bowed in adoration before the Lord, every one in front of his
tent, when they saw the pillar of cloud come down upon the tent and
stand before the door. Out of this cloud Jehovah talked with Moses ([Exo
33:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007).md) "face to face, as a man talks
with his friend" ([Exo 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011).md); that is
to say, not from the distance of heaven, through any kind of medium
whatever, but "mouth to mouth," as it is called in [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008.md), as closely and directly as
friends talk to one another. "These words indicate, therefore, a
familiar conversation, just as much as if it had been said, that God
appeared to Moses in some peculiar form of manifestation. If any one
objects to this, that it is at variance with the assertion which we
shall come to presently, 'Thou canst not see My face,' the answer is a
very simple one. Although Jehovah showed Himself to Moses in some
peculiar form of manifestation, He never appeared in His own essential
glory, but only in such a mode as human weakness could bear. This
solution contains a tacit comparison, viz., that there never was any one
equal to Moses, or who had attained to the same dignity as he" (Calvin).
When Moses returned to the tent, his servant Joshua remained behind as
guard. - This condescension on the part of Jehovah towards Moses could
not fail to strengthen the people in their reliance upon their leader,
as the confidant of Jehovah. And Moses himself was encouraged thereby to
endeavour to effect a perfect restoration of the covenant bond that had
been destroyed.

[Exodus 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 33:12</span></span>

Jehovah had commanded Moses to lead the people to Canaan, and promised
him the guidance of an angel; but He had expressly distinguished this
angel from His own personal presence ([Exo
33:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001).md). Moreover, though it has not
been mentioned before, Jehovah had said to Moses, "I have known thee by
name," - i.e., I have recognised thee as Mine, and chosen and called
thee to execute My will (cf. [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md); [Isa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001).md), or put thee into "a
specifically personal relation to God, which was peculiar to Moses, and
therefore was associated with his name" (Oehler); - "and thou hast also
found grace in My eyes," inasmuch as God had granted a hearing to his
former intercession. Moses now reminded the Lord of this divine
assurance with such courage as can only be produced by faith, which
wrestles with God and will not let Him go without a blessing ([Gen
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#027).md); and upon the strength of this
he presented the petition ([Exo
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#013).md), "Let me know Thy way (the way
which Thou wilt take with me and with this people), that I may know
Thee, in order that I may find grace in Thine eyes, and see that this
people is Thy people." The meaning is this: If I have found grace in Thy
sight, and Thou hast recognised me as Thy servant, and called me to be
the leader of this people, do not leave me in uncertainty as to Thine
intentions concerning the people, or as to the angel whom Thou wilt give
as a guide to me and the nation, that I may know Thee, that is to say,
that my finding grace in Thine eyes may become a reality;

(Note: Domine fac ut verbis tuis respondeat eventus. Calvin.)

and if Thou wilt lead the people up to Canaan, consider that it is Thine
own people, to whom Thou must acknowledge Thyself as its God. Such
boldness of undoubting faith presses to the heart of God, and brings
away the blessing. Jehovah replied ([Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014).md), "My face will go, and I shall
give thee rest," - that is to say, shall bring thee and all this people
into the land, where ye will find rest ([Deu
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#020).md). The "face" of Jehovah is
Jehovah in His own personal presence, and is identical with the "angel"
in whom the name of Jehovah was ([Exo
23:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020).md), and who is therefore called
in [Isa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md) "the angel of His face."

With this assurance on the part of God, the covenant bond was completely
restored. But to make more sure of it. Moses replied ([Exo
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#015.md), [Exo
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#016).md), "If Thy face is not going
(with us), lead us not up hence. And whereby shall it be known that I
have found grace in thine eyes, I and Thy people, if not (lit., is it
not known) in Thy going with us, that we, I and Thy people, are
distinguished (see at [Exo 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018).md)
before every nation upon the face of the earth?" These words do not
express any doubt as to the truth of the divine assurance, "but a
certain feeling of the insufficiency of the assurance," inasmuch as even
with the restoration of the former condition of things there still
remained "the fear lest the evil root of the people's rebellion, which
had once manifested itself, should bread forth again at any moment"
(Baumgarten). For this reason Jehovah assured him that this request also
should be granted ([Exo 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#017).md). "There
was nothing extraordinary in the fact that Moses desired for himself and
his people that they might be distinguished before every nation upon the
face of the earth; this was merely the firm hold of faith upon the
calling and election of God ([Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005).md)."

[Exodus 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 33:18</span></span>

Moses was emboldened by this, and now prayed to the Lord, "Let me see
Thy glory." What Moses desired to see, as the answer of God clearly
shows, must have been something surpassing all former revelations of the
glory of Jehovah ([Exo 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#007.md), [Exo
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#010.md); [Exo
24:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#016).md), and even going beyond
Jehovah's talking with him face to face ([Exo
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011).md). When God talked with him face
to face, or mouth to mouth, he merely saw a "similitude of Jehovah"
([Num 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008).md), a form which rendered the
invisible being of God visible to the human eye, i.e., a manifestation
of the divine glory in a certain form, and not the direct or essential
glory of Jehovah, whilst the people saw this glory under the veil of a
dark cloud, rendered luminous by fire, that is to say, they only saw its
splendour as it shone through the cloud; and even the elders, at the
time when the covenant was made, only saw the God of Israel in a certain
form which hid from their eyes the essential being of God ([Exo
24:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010).md). What Moses desired,
therefore, was a sight of the glory or essential being of God, without
any figure, and without a veil.

Moses was urged to offer this prayer, as Calvin truly says, not by
"stulta curiositas, quae ut plurimum titillat hominum mentes, ut
audacter penetrare tentent usque ad ultima caelorum arcana," but by "a
desire to cross the chasm which had been made by the apostasy of the
nation, that for the future he might have a firmer footing than the
previous history had given him. As so great a stress had been laid upon
his own person in his present task of mediation between the offended
Jehovah and the apostate nation, he felt that the separation, which
existed between himself and Jehovah, introduced a disturbing element
into his office. For if his own personal fellowship with Jehovah was not
fully established, and raised above all possibility of disturbance,
there could be no eternal foundation for the perpetuity of his
mediation" (Baumgarten). As a man called by God to be His servant, he
was not yet the perfect mediator; but although he was faithful in all
his house, it was only as a servant, called εἰς μαρτύριον τῶν
λαληθησομένων ([Heb 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005).md), i.e., as a
herald of the saving revelations of God, preparing the way for the
coming of the perfect Mediator. Jehovah therefore granted his request,
but only so far as the limit existing between the infinite and holy God
and finite and sinful man allowed. "I will make all My goodness pass
before thy face, and proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee (בּשׁם קרא
see at [Gen 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026).md), and will be
gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will
show mercy. Thou canst not see My face, for man cannot see Me and live."
The words וגו וחנּתי, although only connected with the previous clause
by the cop. ו, are to be understood in a causative sense, as expressing
the reason why Moses' request was granted, viz., that it was an act of
unconditional grace and compassion on the part of God, to which no man,
not even Moses, could lay any just claim. The apostle Paul uses the
words in the same sense in [Rom 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#015.md),
for the purpose of overthrowing the claims of self-righteous Jews to
participate in the Messianic salvation. - No mortal man can see the face
of God and remain alive; for not only is the holy God a consuming fire
to unholy man, but a limit has been set, in and with the σῶμα χοΐκόν and
ψυχικόν (the earthly and psychical body) of man, between the infinite
God, the absolute Spirit, and the human spirit clothed in an earthly
body, which will only be removed by the "redemption of our body," and
our being clothed in a "spiritual body," and which, so long as it lasts,
renders a direct sight of the glory of God impossible. As our bodily eye
is dazzled, and its power of vision destroyed, by looking directly at
the brightness of the sun, so would our whole nature be destroyed by an
unveiled sight of the brilliancy of the glory of God. So long as we are
clothed with this body, which was destined, indeed, from the very first
to be transformed into the glorified state of the immortality of the
spirit, but has become through the fall a prey to the corruption of
death, we can only walk in faith, and only see God with the eye of
faith, so far as He has revealed His glory to us in His works and His
word. When we have become like God, and have been transformed into the
"divine nature" ([Pe2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004).md), then, and
not till then, shall we see Him as He is; then we shall see His glory
without a veil, and live before Him for ever. For this reason Moses had
to content himself with the passing by of the glory of God before his
face, and with the revelation of the name of Jehovah through the medium
of the word, in which God discloses His inmost being, and, so to speak,
His whole heart to faith. In [Exo
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022.md) "My glory" is used for "all My
goodness," and in [Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md) it is
stated that Jehovah passed by before the face of Moses. טוּב is not to
be understood in the sense of beautiful, or beauty, but signifies
goodness; not the brilliancy which strikes the senses, but the spiritual
and ethical nature of the Divine Being. For the manifestation of
Jehovah, which passed before Moses, was intended unquestionably to
reveal nothing else than what Jehovah expressed in the proclamation of
His name.

The manifested glory of the Lord would so surely be followed by the
destruction of man, that even Moses needed to be protected before it
([Exo 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#021.md), [Exo
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022).md). Whilst Jehovah, therefore,
allowed him to come to a place upon the rock near Him, i.e., upon the
summit of Sinai ([Exo 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#002).md), He said
that He would put him in a cleft of the rock whilst He was passing by,
and cover him with His hand when He had gone by, that he might see His
back, because His face could not be seen. The back, as contrasted with
the face, signifies the reflection of the glory of God that had just
passed by. The words are transferred anthropomorphically from man to
God, because human language and human thought can only conceive of the
nature of the absolute Spirit according to the analogy of the human
form. As the inward nature of man manifests itself in his face, and the
sight of his back gives only an imperfect and outward view of him, so
Moses saw only the back and not the face of Jehovah. It is impossible to
put more into human words concerning this unparalleled vision, which far
surpasses all human thought and comprehension. According to [Exo
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#002.md), the place where Moses stood by
the Lord was at the top (the head) of Sinai, and no more can be
determined with certainty concerning it. The cleft in the rock ([Exo
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022).md) has been supposed by some to be
the same place as the "cave" in which Elijah lodged at Horeb, and where
the Lord appeared to him in the still small voice ([Kg1
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#009)..md). The real summit of the Jebel
Musa consists of "a small area of huge rocks, about 80 feet in
diameter," upon which there is now a chapel that has almost fallen down,
and about 40 feet to the south-west a dilapidated mosque (Robinson,
Palestine, vol. i. p. 153). Below this mosque, according to Seetzen
(Reise iii. pp. 83, 84), there is a very small grotto, into which you
descend by several steps, and to which a large block of granite, about a
fathom and a half long and six spans in height, serves as a roof.
According to the Mussulman tradition, which the Greek monks also accept,
it was in this small grotto that Moses received the law; though other
monks point out a "hole, just large enough for a man," near the altar of
the Elijah chapel, on the small plain upon the ridge of Sinai, above
which the loftier peak rises about 700 feet, as the cave in which Elijah
lodged on Horeb (Robinson, Pal. ut supra).
