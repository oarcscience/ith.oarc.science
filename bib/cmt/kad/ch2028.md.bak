### [2 Chronicles Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 28:1</span></span>

In the general statements as to the king's age, and the duration and the
spirit of his reign, both accounts ([Ch2
28:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md); [Kg2
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001).md), agree entirely, with the
exception of some unessential divergences; see the commentary on [Kg2
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001.md). From [Ch2
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005.md) onwards both historians go their
own ways, so that they coincide only in mentioning the most important
events of the reign of this quite untheocratic king. The author of the
book of Kings, in accordance with his plan, records only very briefly
the advance of the allied kings Rezin and Pekah against Jerusalem, the
capture of the seaport Elath by the Syrians, the recourse which the
hard-pressed Ahaz had to the help of Tiglath-pileser the king of
Assyria, whom he induced, by sending him the temple and palace treasures
of gold and silver, to advance upon Damascus, to capture that city, to
destroy the Syrian kingdom, to lead the inhabitants away captive to Kir,
and to slay King Rezin ([Ch2 28:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005).md).
Then he records how Ahaz, on a visit which he paid the Assyrian king in
Damascus, saw an altar which so delighted him, that he sent a pattern of
it to the priest Urijah, with the command to build a similar altar for
the temple of the Lord, on which Ahaz on his return not only sacrificed
himself, but also commanded that all the sacrifices of the congregation
should be offered. And finally, he recounts how he laid violent hands on
the brazen vessels of the court, and caused the outer covered sabbath
way to be removed into the temple because of the king of Assyria ([Ch2
28:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#010).md); and then the history of
Ahaz is concluded by the standing formulae ([Ch2
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#019.md), [Ch2
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020).md). The author of the Chronicle,
on the contrary, depicts in holy indignation against the crimes of the
godless Ahaz, how God punished him for his sins. 1. He tells us how God
gave Ahaz into the hand of the king of Syria, who smote him and led away
many prisoners to Damascus, and into the hand of King Pekah of Israel,
who inflicted on him a dreadful defeat, slew 120,000 men, together with
a royal prince and two of the highest officials of the court, and
carried away 200,000 prisoners-women and children-with a great booty
([Ch2 28:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005).md); and how the Israelites
yet, at the exhortation of the prophet Oded, and of some of the heads of
the people who supported the prophet, again freed the prisoners,
provided them with food and clothing, and conducted them back to Jericho
([Ch2 28:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009).md). 2. He records that
Ahaz turned to the king of Assyria for help ([Ch2
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016).md), but that God still further
humbled Israel by an invasion of the land by the Edomites, who carried
prisoners away ([Ch2 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017).md); by an
attack of the Philistines, who deprived Judah of a great number of
cities ([Ch2 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018).md); and finally also
by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser, who, although Ahaz had sent him
the gold and silver of the temple and of the palaces of the kings and
princes, yet did not help him, but rather oppressed him ([Ch2
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020)..md). 3. Then he recounts how,
notwithstanding all this, Ahaz sinned still more against Jahve by
sacrificing to the idols of the Syrians, cutting up the vessels of the
house of God, closing the doors of the temple, and erecting altars and
high places in all corners of Jerusalem, and in all the cities of Judah,
for the purpose of sacrificing to idols ([Ch2
28:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022).md). This whole description is
planned and wrought out rhetorically; cf. C. P. Caspari, der
syrisch-ephraimitische Krieg, S. 42ff. Out of the historical materials,
those facts which show how Ahaz, notwithstanding the heavy blows which
Jahve inflicted upon him, always sinned more deeply against the Lord his
God, are chosen, and oratorically so presented as not only to bring
before us the increasing obduracy of Ahaz, but also, by the
representation of the conduct of the citizens and warriors of the
kingdom of Israel towards the people of Judah who were prisoners, the
deep fall of that kingdom.

[2 Chronicles 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 28:5</span></span>

The war with the Kings Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel. - On the
events of this war, so far as they can be ascertained by uniting the
statements of our chapter with the summary account in 2 Kings 16, see
the commentary on [Kg2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md). The
author of the Chronicle brings the two main battles prominently forward
as illustrations of the way in which Jahve gave Ahaz into the power of
his enemies because of his defection from Him. Into the power of the
king of Aram. They (ויּכּוּ, and they, the Arameans) smote בו, in him,
i.e., they inflicted on his army a great defeat. Just so also ממּנוּ
signifies of his army. גּדולה שׁביה, a great imprisonment, i.e., a great
number of prisoners. And into the power of the king of Israel, Pekah,
who inflicted on him a still greater defeat. He slew in (among) Judah
120,000 men "in one day," i.e., in a great decisive battle. Judah
suffered these defeats because they (the men of Judah) had forsaken
Jahve the God of their fathers. Judah's defection from the Lord is not,
indeed, expressly mentioned in the first verses of the chapter, but may
be inferred as a matter of course from the remark as to the people under
Jotham, [Ch2 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002.md). If under that king,
who did that which was right in the eyes of Jahve, and stedfastly walked
before the Lord ([Ch2 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#006).md), they did
corruptly, they must naturally have departed much further from the God
of the fathers, and been sunk much deeper in the worship of idols, and
the worship on high places, under Ahaz, who served the Baals and other
idols.

[2 Chronicles 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 28:7</span></span>

In this battle, Zichri, an Ephraimite hero, slew three men who were
closely connected with the king: Maaseiah, the king's son, i.e., not a
son of Ahaz, for in the first years of his reign, in which this war
arose, he cannot have had an adult son capable of bearing arms, but a
royal prince, a cousin or uncle of Ahaz, as in [Ch2
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#025.md); [Ch2
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#011.md), etc. (cf. Caspari, loc. cit. S.
45ff.); Azrikam, a prince of the house, probably not of the house of God
([Ch2 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#013.md); [Ch2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#011).md), but a high official in the
royal palace; and Elkanah, the second from the king, i.e., his first
minister; cf. [Est 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003.md); [Sa1
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#017.md).

[2 Chronicles 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 28:8</span></span>

The Israelites, moreover, carried away 200,000 - women, sons, and
daughters-from their brethren, and a great quantity of spoil, and
brought the booty (prisoners and goods; cf. for שׁלל of men, [Jdg
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030).md) to Samaria. אחיהם, the brethren
of the Israelites, is the name given, with emphasis, to the inhabitants
of Judah, here and in [Ch2 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#011.md), in
order to point out the cruelty of the Israelites in not scrupling to
carry away captive the defenceless women and children of their brethren.

The modern critics have taken offence at the large numbers, 120,000
slain and 200,000 women and children taken prisoners, and have declared
them to be exaggerations of the wonder-loving chronicler (Gesen. on
Isa., De Wette, Winer, etc.). But in this they are mistaken; for if we
consider the war more closely, we learn from [Isa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006.md) that the allied kings purposed to
annihilate the kingdom of Judah. And, moreover, the Ephraimites acted
always with extreme cruelty in war (cf. [Kg2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016).md); but more especially cherished
the fiercest hatred against the men of Judah, because these regarded
them as having fallen away from the service of the true God ([Ch2
25:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#006.md); [Ch2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#004)..md). But in a war for the existence
of the kingdom, Ahaz must certainly have called out the whole male
population capable of bearing arms, which is estimated in the time of
Amaziah at 300,000 men, and in that of Uzziah at 307,500 ([Isa
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#005.md); [Isa
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013).md), - numbers which appear
thoroughly credible, considering the size and populousness of Judah. If
we suppose the army of Ahaz to have been as large, in a decisive battle
fought with all possible energy nearly 120,000 men may have fallen,
especially if the Ephraimites, in their exasperation, unsparingly
butchered their enemies, as the narrative would seem to hint both by the
word הרג in [Ch2 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006.md), which signifies
to murder, massacre, butcher, and by the saying of the prophet, [Ch2
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009.md), "Ye massacred among them with a
rage which reached to heaven." By the character of the war, which
resembled a civil or even a religious war, and by the cruelty of the
Israelites, the great number of those carried captive is accounted for;
for after the great defeat of the men of Judah the whole land fell into
the hands of the enemy, so that they could sate their hatred and anger
to their heart's content by carrying off the defenceless women and
children to make them slaves. And finally, we must also consider that
the numbers of the slain and of the prisoners are not founded upon exact
enumeration, but upon a mere general estimate. The immense loss which
was sustained in the battle was estimated on the side of Judah at
120,000 men; and the number of captive women and children was so
immense, that they were, or might be, estimated at 200,000 souls, it
being impossible to give an exact statement of their number. These
numbers were consequently recorded in the annals of the kingdom, whence
the author of the Chronicle has taken them; cf. Caspari, S. 37ff.

[2 Chronicles 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 28:9</span></span>

The liberation of the prisoners. - In Samaria there was a prophet of the
Lord (i.e., not of the Jahve there worshipped in the calf images, but of
the true God, like Hosea, who also at that time laboured in the kingdom
of the ten tribes), Oded by name. He went forth to meet the army
returning with the prisoners and the booty, as Azariha-ben-Oded ([Ch2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#002).md) once went to meet Asa; pointed
out to the warriors the cruelty of their treatment of their brethren,
and the guilt, calling to Heaven for vengeance, which they thereby
incurred; and exhorted them to turn away the anger of God which was upon
them, by sending back the prisoners. To soften the hearts of the rude
warriors, and to gain them for his purpose, he tells them ([Ch2
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009).md), "Because the Lord God of your
fathers was wroth, He gave them (the men of Judah) into your hand:" your
victory over them is consequently not the fruit of your power and
valour, but the work of the God of your fathers, whose wrath Judah has
drawn upon itself by its defection from Him. This you should have
considered, and so have had pity upon those smitten by the wrath of God;
"but he have slaughtered among them with a rage which reacheth up to
heaven," i.e., not merely with a rage beyond all measure, but a rage
which calls to God for vengeance; cf. [Ezr
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#006.md).

[Ch2 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#010.md)

"And now the sons of Judah and Jerusalem ye purpose to subject to
yourselves for bondmen and bondwomen!" יהוּדה בּני is accus., and
precedes as being emphatic; i.e., your brethren, whom the wrath of God
has smitten, you purpose to keep in subjection. אתּם also is
emphatically placed, and then is again emphasized at the end of the
sentence by the suffix in לכם: "Are there not, only concerning you, with
you, sins with Jahve your God?" i.e., Have you, to regard only you, not
also burdened yourselves with many sins against the Lord? The question
הלא, is a lively way of expressing assurance as to a matter which is not
at all doubtful.

[Ch2 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#011.md)

After thus quickening the conscience, he calls upon them to send back
the prisoners which they had carried away from among their brethren,
because the anger of Jahve was upon them. Already in their pitiless
butchery of their brethren they had committed a sin which cried to
heaven, which challenged God's anger and His punishments; but by the
carrying away of the women and children from their brethren they had
filled up the measure of their sin, so that God's anger and rage must
fall upon them.

[Ch2 28:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012.md)

This speech made a deep impression. Four of the heads of the
Ephraimites, here mentioned by name, - according to [Ch2
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012.md), four princes at the head of the
assembled people, - came before those coming from the army (על קוּם, to
come forward before one, to meet one), and said, [Ch2
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#013.md), "Bring not the captives hither;
for in order that a sin of Jahve come upon us, do you purpose (do you
intend) to add to our sins and to our guilt?" i.e., to increase our sins
and our guilt by making these prisoners slaves; "for great is our guilt,
and fierce wrath upon Israel."

[Ch2 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#014.md)

Then the armed men (החלוּץ, cf. [Ch1
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#023).md) who had escorted the prisoners
to Samaria left the prisoners and the booty before the princes and the
whole assembly.

[Ch2 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015.md)

"And the men which were specified by name stood up." בשׁמות נקּבוּ אשׁר
does not signify those before mentioned ([Ch2
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012).md), but the men specified by name,
distinguished or famous men (see on [Ch1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#031).md), among whom, without doubt,
those mentioned in [Ch2 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012.md) are
included, but not these alone; other prominent men are also meant. These
received the prisoners and the booty, clothed all the naked, providing
them with clothes and shoes (sandals) from the booty, gave them to eat
and to drink, anointed them, and set all the feeble upon asses, and
brought them to Jericho to their brethren (countrymen). The description
is picturesque, portraying with satisfaction the loving pity for the
miserable. מערמּים, nakedness, abstr. pro concr., the naked. לכל־כּושׁל
is accus., and a nearer definition of the suffix in y

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

nahaluwm: they brought them, (not all, but only) all the stumbling, who
could not, owing to their fatigue, make the journey on foot. Jericho,
the city of palm trees, as in [Jdg
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md), in the tribe of Benjamin,
belonged to the kingdom of Judah; see [Jos
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#021.md). Arrived there, the prisoners
were with their brethren.

The speech of the prophet Oded is reckoned by Gesenius, on Isaiah, S.
269, among the speeches invented by the chronicler; but very erroneously
so: cf. against him, Caspari, loc cit. i. S. 49ff. The speech cannot be
separated from the fact of the liberation of the prisoners carried away
from Judah, which it brought about; and that is shown to be a historical
fact by the names of the tribal princes of Ephraim, who, in consequence
of the warning of the prophet, took his part and accomplished the
sending of them back; they being names which are not elsewhere met with
([Ch2 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012).md). The spontaneous
interference of these tribal chiefs would not be in itself impossible,
but yet it is very improbable, and becomes perfectly comprehensible only
by the statement that these men were roused and encouraged thereto by
the word of a prophet. We must consequently regard the speech of the
prophet as a fact which is as well established as that narrated in [Ch2
28:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012.md). "If that which is narrated
in [Ch2 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012.md). be not invented, it
would betray the greatest levity to hold that which is recorded in [Ch2
28:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009) to be incredible" (Casp..md).
And, moreover, the speech of the prophet does not contain the thoughts
and phrases current with the author of the Chronicle, but is quite
suitable to the circumstances, and so fully corresponds to what we
should expect to hear from a prophet on such an occasion, that there is
not the slightest reason to doubt the authenticity of its contents.
Finally, the whole transaction is exactly parallel to the interference
of the prophet Shemaiah in [Kg1
12:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#022.md) ([Ch2
11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001).md), who exhorted the army of
Judah, fully determined upon war with the ten tribes which had just
revolted from the house of David, not to make war upon their brethren
the Israelites, as the revolt had been brought about by God. "That fact
at the beginning of the history of the two separated kingdoms, and this
at the end of it, finely correspond to each other. In the one place it
is a Judaean prophet who exhorts the men of Judah, in the other an
Ephraimite prophet who exhorts the Ephraimites, to show a conciliatory
spirit to the related people; and in both cases they are successful. If
we do not doubt the truth of the even narrated in [Kg1
12:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#022.md), why should that recorded in
[Ch2 28:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009.md) be invented?" (Casp. S.
50.)

[2 Chronicles 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 28:16</span></span>

The further chastisements inflicted upon King Ahaz and the kingdom of
Judah. - [Ch2 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md). At this time,
when the kings Rezin and Pekah had so smitten Ahaz, the latter sent to
the king of Assyria praying him for help. The time when Ahaz sought the
help of the king of Assyria is neither exactly stated in [Kg2
16:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md), nor can we conclude, as
Bertheau thinks we can, from Isa. 7. that it happened soon after the
invasion of Judah by the allied kings. The plural אשּׁוּר מלכי is
rhetorical, like the plur. בּנין, [Ch2
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003.md). For, that Ahaz applied only to
one king, in the opinion of the chronicler also, we learn from [Ch2
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020.md), [Ch2
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md). By the plural the thought is
expressed that Ahaz, instead of seeking the help of Jahve his God, which
the prophet had promised him ([Isa
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004)..md), turned to the kings of the
world-power, so hostile to the kingdom of God, from whom he naturally
could obtain no real help. Even here the thought which is expressed only
in [Ch2 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020.md), [Ch2
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md), is present to the mind of the
author of the Chronicle. For before he narrates the issue of the help
thus sought from the Assyrian world-power in [Ch2
28:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017.md), he ranges all the other
afflictions which Judah suffered by its enemies, viz., the devastating
inroads of the Edomites and Philistines, in a series of circumstantial
clauses, as they preceded in time the oppression of Tiglath-pileser.

[Ch2 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017.md)

[Ch2 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017.md) is to be translated, "And
besides, the Edomites had come, and had inflicted a defeat upon Judah,
and carried away captives." עוד, yet besides, praeterea, as in [Gen
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#006.md); [Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005.md). The Edomites had been made
subject to the kingdom of Judah only by Amaziah and Uzziah ([Ch2
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#011.md)., [Ch2
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#002).md); but freed by Rezin from this
(cf. [Kg2 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006).md), they immediately
seized the opportunity to make an inroad upon Judah, and take vengeance
on the inhabitants.

[Ch2 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md)

And the Philistines whom Uzziah had subdued ([Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006).md) made use of the pressure of the
Syrians and Ephraimites upon Judah, not only to shake off the yoke
imposed upon them, but also to fall plundering upon the cities of the
lowland and the south of Judah, and to extend their territory by the
capture of several cities of Judah. They took Beth-shemesh, the present
Ain Shems; and Ajalon, the present village Jlo (see on [Ch1
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044.md) and [Ch1
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054).md); Gederoth in the lowland ([Jos
15:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#041).md), not yet discovered, for there
are not sufficient grounds for identifying it with Gedera ([Jos
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#036).md), which v. de Velde has pointed
out south-eastward from Jabneh (see on [Ch1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#004).md); Shocho, the present Shuweike,
which Rehoboam had fortified ([Ch2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#007).md); Timnah, on the frontier of the
tribal domain of Judah, the present Tibneh, three-quarters of an hour to
the west of Ain Shems (see on [Jos
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010).md); and Gimzo, now Jims, a large
village about two miles south-east of Lydda (Lud) on the way to
Jerusalem (Rob. sub voce). The three last-named cities, with their
daughters, i.e., the small villages dependent upon them.

[Ch2 28:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#019.md)

Judah suffered this defeat, because God humbled them on account of Ahaz.
Ahaz is called king of Israel, not because he walked in the ways of the
kings of the kingdom of the ten tribes ([Ch2
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002).md), but ironically, because his
government was the bitterest satire upon the name of the king of Israel,
i.e., of the people of God (Casp.); so that Israel here, and in [Ch2
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027.md), as in [Ch2
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002.md); [Ch2
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#006.md), is used with reference to the
pregnant signification of the word. הפריע כּי, for (Ahaz) had acted
wantonly in Judah; not: made Judah wanton, for הפריע is construed with
b, not with accus. obj., as in [Exo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#004.md).

After this episode the narrator comes back upon the help which Ahaz
sought of the Assyrians. The Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser (on the name,
see on [Ch1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#006).md) did indeed come, but
עליו, against him (Ahaz), and oppressed him, but strengthened him not.
חזקו ולא לו ויּצר Thenius and Bertheau translate: he oppressed him, that
is, besieged him, yet did not overcome him; adducing in support of this,
that חזק c. accus. cannot be shown to occur in the signification to
strengthen one, and according to [Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md); [Kg1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#022.md), is to be translated, to
overcome. But this translation does not at all suit the reason given in
the following clause: "for Ahaz had plundered the house of Jahve, ...
and given it to the king of Asshur; but it did not result in help to
him." The sending away of the temple and palace treasures to the
Assyrian king, to obtain his help, cannot possibly be stated as the
reason why Tiglath-pileser besieged Ahaz, but did not overcome him, but
only as a reason why he did not give Ahaz the expected help, and so did
not strengthen him. חזקו ולא corresponds to the לו לעזרה ולא, [Ch2
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md), and both clauses refer back to
לו לעזר, [Ch2 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md). That which Ahaz
wished to buy from Tiglath-pileser, by sending him the treasures of the
palace and the temple, - namely, help against his enemies, - he did not
thereby obtain, but the opposite, viz., that Tiglath-pileser came
against him and oppressed him. When, on the contrary, Thenius takes the
matter thus, that the subjection of Ahaz under Tiglath-pileser was
indeed prevented by the treasures given, but the support desired was not
purchased by them, he has ungrammatically taken חזק as imperfect, and
violently torn away the לו לעזרה לו ולא from what precedes. If we
connect these words, as the adversative ולא requires, with וגו ויּתּן,
then the expression, "Ahaz gave the Assyrian king the treasures of the
temple, ... but it did not result in help to him," gives no support to
the idea that Tiglath-pileser besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
The context therefore necessarily demands that חזק should have the
active signification, to strengthen, notwithstanding that חזק in Kal is
mainly used as intransitive. Moreover, לו ויּצר also does not denote he
besieged, as אליו ויּצר or עליו, [Sa2
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015.md); [Sa1
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#008.md); but only, he oppressed him, and
cannot here be translated otherwise than the לו חצר, [Ch2
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md), which corresponds to it, where
Bertheau also has decided in favour of the signification oppress. It is
not stated wherein the oppression consisted; but without doubt it was
that Tiglath-pileser, after he had both slain Rezin and conquered his
kingdom, and also taken away many cities in Galilee and the land of
Naphtali from Pekah, carrying away the inhabitants to Assyria ([Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md) and [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md), advanced against Ahaz himself,
to make him a tributary. The verbs חלק and ויּתּן ([Ch2
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021).md) are pluperfects: "for Ahaz had
plundered," etc. Not when Tiglath-pileser oppressed him, but when he
besought help of that king, Ahaz had sent him the treasures of the
temple and the palace as שׁחד, [Kg2
16:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md). חלק denotes to plunder, like
חלק, a share of booty, [Num 31:36](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#036.md), and
booty, [Job 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#005.md). The selection of
this word for the taking away of the treasures of silver and gold out of
the temple and palace arises from the impassioned nature of the
language. The taking away of these treasures was, in fact, a plundering
of the temple and of the palace. Had Ahaz trusted in the Lord his God,
he would not have required to lay violent hands on these treasures.
והשּׂרים is added to המּלך בּית, to signify that Ahaz laid hands upon
the precious things belonging to the high officials who dwelt in the
palace, and delivered them over to the Assyrian king (Berth.).

Although the author of the Chronicle makes the further remark, that the
giving of these treasures over did not result in help to Ahaz, yet it
cannot be at all doubtful that he had the fact recorded in [Kg2
16:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md) before his eyes, and says
nothing inconsistent with that account. According to [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md), Tiglath-pileser, in consequence
of the present sent him, took the field, conquered and destroyed the
kingdom of Rezin, and also took possession of the northern part of the
kingdom of Israel, as is narrated in [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md). The author of the Chronicle has
not mentioned these events, because Ahaz was not thereby really helped.
Although the kings Rezin and Pekah were compelled to abandon their plan
of capturing Jerusalem and subduing the kingdom of Judah, by the inroad
of the Assyrians into their land, yet this help was to be regarded as
nothing, seeing that Tiglath-pileser not only retained the conquered
territories and cities for himself, but also undertook the whole
campaign, not to strengthen Ahaz, but for the extension of his own (the
Assyrian) power, and so made use of it, and, as we are told in [Ch2
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020.md) of the Chronicle, oppressed
Ahaz. This oppression is, it is true, not expressly mentioned in 2 Kings
16, but is hinted in [Kg2 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018.md), and
placed beyond doubt by [Kg2 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#007.md), [Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md), [Kg2
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#020.md); cf. [Isa
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#005.md). In [Kg2
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018.md) it is recorded that Ahaz removed
the covered sabbath portico which had been built to the house of God,
and the external entrance of the king into the house of the Lord,
because of (מפּני) the king of Assyria. Manifestly Ahaz feared, as J. D.
Mich. has already rightly concluded from this, that the king of Assyria,
whom he had summoned to his assistance, might at some time desire to
take possession of the city, and that in such a case this covered
sabbath porch and an external entrance into the temple might be of use
to him in the siege. This note, therefore, notwithstanding its
obscurity, yet gives sufficiently clear testimony in favour of the
statement in the Chronicle, that the king of Assyria, who had been
called upon by Ahaz for help, oppressed him, upon which doubt has been
cast by Gesen. Isa. i. S. 269, etc. Tiglath-pileser must have in some
way shown a desire to possess Jerusalem, and Ahaz have consequently
feared that he might wish to take it by force. But from [Kg2
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#007.md), [Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md), [Kg2
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#020.md), cf. [Isa
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#005.md), it is quite certain Ahaz had
become tributary to the Assyrian king, and the kingdom dependent upon
the Assyrians. It is true, indeed, that in these passages, strictly
interpreted, this subjection of Judah is only said to exist immediately
before the invasion of Sennacherib; but since Assyria made no war upon
Judah between the campaign of Tiglath-pileser against Damascus and
Samaria and Sennacherib's attack, the subjection of Judah to Assyria,
which Hezekiah brought to an end, can only have dated from the time of
Ahaz, and can only have commenced when Ahaz had called in
Tiglath-pileser to aid him against his enemies. Certainly the exact
means by which Tiglath-pileser compelled Ahaz to submit and to pay
tribute cannot be recognised under, and ascertained from, the rhetorical
mode of expression: Tiglath-pileser came against him, and oppressed him.
Neither עליו ויּבא nor לו ויּצר require us to suppose that
Tiglath-pileser advanced against Jerusalem with an army, although it is
not impossible that Tiglath-pileser, after having conquered the
Israelite cities in Galilee and the land of Naphtali, and carried away
their inhabitants to Assyria ([Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md), may have made a further
advance, and demanded of Ahaz tribute and submission, ordering a
detachment of his troops to march into Judah to enforce his demand. But
the words quoted do not necessarily mean more than that Tiglath made the
demand on Ahaz for tribute from Galilee, with the threat that, if he
should refuse it, he would march into and conquer Judah; and that Ahaz,
feeling himself unable to cope successfully with so powerful a king,
promised to pay the tribute without going to war. Even in this last case
the author of the Chronicle might say that the king who had been
summoned by Ahaz to his assistance came against him and oppressed him,
and helped him not. Cf. also the elaborate defence of the account in the
Chronicle, in Caspari, S. 56ff.

[2 Chronicles 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 28:22</span></span>

Increase of Ahaz' transgressions against the Lord. - [Ch2
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md). After this proof that Ahaz only
brought greater oppression upon himself by seeking help from the king of
Assyria ([Ch2 28:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016).md), there follows
([Ch2 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022)..md) an account of how he, in
his trouble, continued to sin more and more against God the Lord, and
hardened himself more and more in idolatry. לו הצר וּבעת corresponds to
the ההיא בּעת [Ch2 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md). "At the time
when they oppressed him, he trespassed yet more against the Lord, he
King Ahaz." In the last words the rhetorical emphasizing of the subject
comes clearly out. The sentence contains a general estimation of the
attitude of the godless king under the divine chastisement, which is
then illustrated by facts ([Ch2
28:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023).md).

[Ch2 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023.md)

He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him, saying, i.e.,
thinking, The gods of the kings of Aram which helped them, to them will
I sacrifice, and they will help me. כּי serves to introduce the saying,
and both הם and להם are rhetorical. Berth. incorrectly translates the
participle המּכּים by the pluperfect: who had smitten him. It was not
after the Syrians had smitten him that Ahaz sought to gain by sacrifice
the help of their gods, but while the Syrians were inflicting defeats
upon him; not after the conclusion of the Syrian war, but during its
course. The ungrammatical translation of the participle by the
pluperfect arises from the view that the contents of our verse, the
statement that Ahaz sacrificed to the Syrian gods, is an unhistorical
misinterpretation of the statement in [Kg2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md)., about the altar which Ahaz saw
when he went to meet the Assyrian king in Damascus, and a copy of which
he caused to be made in Jerusalem, and set up in the temple court, in
the place of the copper altar of burnt-offering. But we have already
rejected that view as unfounded, in the exposition of [Kg2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md). Since Ahaz had cast and erected
statues to the Baals, and even sacrificed his son to Moloch, he
naturally would not scruple to sacrifice to the Assyrian gods to secure
their help. But they (these gods) brought ruin to him and to all Israel.
לכל־ישׂ is in the accusative, and co-ordinate with the suffix in
הכשׁילו.

[Ch2 28:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#024.md)

Not content with thus worshipping strange gods, Ahaz laid violent hands
upon the temple vessels and suppressed the temple worship. He collected
all the vessels of the house of God together, and broke them in pieces.
These words also are rhetorical, so that neither the יאסף, which depicts
the matter vividly, nor the כּל, is to be pressed. The קצּץ of the
vessels consisted, according to [Kg2
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017.md), in this, that he mutilated the
artistically wrought vessels of the court, and cut out the panels from
the bases, and took away the lavers from them, and took down the brazen
sea from the oxen on which it stood, and set it upon a pavement of
stones. "And he closed the doors of the house of Jahve," in order to put
an end to the Jahve-worship in the temple, which he regarded as
superfluous, since he had erected altars at the corners of all the
streets in Jerusalem, and in all the cities of Judah. The statement as
to the closing of the temple doors, to which reference is made in [Ch2
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003.md), [Ch2
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#007.md), is said by Berth. not to reset
upon good historical recollection, because the book of Kings not only
does not say anything of it, but also clearly gives us to understand
that Ahaz allowed the Jahve-worship to continue, [Kg2
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015.md). That the book of Kings ([Ch2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016).md) makes no mention of this
circumstance does not prove much, it being an argumentum e silentio; for
the book of Kings is not a complete history, it contains only a short
excerpt from the history of the kings; while the intimation given us in
[Kg2 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015.md). as to the continuation of
the worship of Jahve, may without difficulty be reconciled with the
closing of the temple doors. The יהוה בּית דּלתות are not the gates of
the court of the temple, but, according to the clear explanation of the
Chronicle, [Ch2 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#007.md), the doors of the
porch, which in [Ch2 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003.md) are also
called doors of the house of Jahve; the "house of Jahve" signifying here
not the whole group of temple buildings, but, in the narrower sense of
the words, denoting only the main body of the temple (the Holy Place and
the Most Holy, wherein Jahve was enthroned). By the closing of the doors
of the porch the worship of Jahve in the Holy Place and the Most Holy
was indeed suspended, but the worship at the altar in the court was not
thereby necessarily interfered with: it might still continue. Now it is
the worship at the altar of burnt-offering alone of which it is said in
[Kg2 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015.md) that Ahaz allowed it to
continue to this extent, that he ordered the priest Urijah to offer all
the burnt-offerings and sacrifices, meat-offerings and drink-offerings,
which were offered morning and evening by both king and people, not upon
the copper sacrificial altar (Solomon's), but on the altar built after
the pattern of that which he had seen at Damascus. The cessation of
worship at this altar is also left unmentioned by the Chronicle, and in
[Ch2 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#007.md). Hezekiah, when he again
opened the doors of the house of Jahve, only says to the priests and
Levites, "Our fathers have forsaken Jahve, and turned their backs on His
sanctuary; yea, have shut the doors of the porch, put out the lamps, and
have not burnt incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the Holy Place
unto the God of Israel." Sacrificing upon an altar built after a heathen
model was not sacrificing to the God of Israel. There is therefore no
ground to doubt the historical truth of the statement in our verse. The
description of the idolatrous conduct of Ahaz concludes with the remark,
[Ch2 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#025.md), that Ahaz thereby provoked
Jahve, the God of his fathers, to anger.

[2 Chronicles 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch2 28:26</span></span>

The end of his reign. - [Ch2 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027.md).
Ahaz indeed both died and was buried in the city, in Jerusalem (as [Kg2
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#020).md), but was not laid in the graves
of the kings, because he had not ruled like a king of the people of God,
the true Israel. Since the name Israel is used in a pregnant sense, as
in [Ch2 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#019.md), the terms in which the
place where he died is designated, "in the city, in Jerusalem," would
seem to have been purposely selected to intimate that Ahaz, because he
had not walked during life like his ancestor David, was not buried along
with David when he died.
