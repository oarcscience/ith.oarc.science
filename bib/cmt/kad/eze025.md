Predictions of Judgment upon the Heathen Nations - Ezekiel 25-32

While the prophet's mouth was to be mute to Israel, the Lord directed
him to speak against the heathen nations, and to foretell to them the
judgment of destruction, that they might not be lifted up by the fall of
the people and kingdom of God, but might recognise in the judgment upon
Israel a work of the omnipotence and righteousness of the Lord, the
Judge of the whole earth. There are seven heathen nations whose
destruction Ezekiel foretells in this section of his book, viz., (1)
Ammon; (2) Moab; (3) Edom; (4) The Philistines (Ezekiel 25); (5) Tyre,
(6) Sidon (Ezekiel 26-28); and (7) Egypt (Ezekiel 29-32). These
prophecies are divided into thirteen words of God by the introductory
formula, "The word of Jehovah came to me," the utterances against Ammon,
Moab, Edom, and the Philistines, being all comprehended in one word of
God; whereas there are four separate words of God directed against Tyre,
one against Sidon, and seven against Egypt. In the seven nations and the
seven words of God directed against Egypt we cannot fail to discover an
allusion to the symbolical significance of the number. Sidon, which had
lost its commanding position and become dependent upon Tyre long before
the time of Ezekiel, is evidently selected for a special word of God
only for the purpose of making up the number seven. And in order to make
it the more apparent that the number has been chosen on account of its
significance, Ezekiel divides his announcement of the judgment upon the
seventh people into seven words of God. On the basis of Gen 1, seven is
the number denoting the completion of the works of God. When, therefore,
Ezekiel selects seven nations and utters seven words of God concerning
the principal nation, namely Egypt, he evidently intends to indicate
thereby that the judgment predicted will be executed and completed upon
the heathen world and its peoples through the word and acts of God. -
The predictions of judgment upon these seven heathen nations are
divisible, accordingly, into two groups. Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia,
Tyre, and Sidon form one group, while the second treats of Egypt alone.
This is certainly the way in which the cycle of these prophecies is to
be divided rather than the plan ordinarily adopted, according to which
the nations included in Ezekiel 25, as representatives of the one phase
of the world-power, are placed in contrast with the other phase of
heathenism represented by Tyre, Sidon, and Egypt. The latter is the
opinion entertained by Hvernick, for example, with regard to the
"beautiful and symmetrical arrangement" of these prophecies. "First of
all," says he, "the prophet shows in one series of nations how the idea
of the judgment of God was realized in the case of those nations which
rose up in direct and open hostility to the theocracy, and thereby
represented the might of heathenism as turned away from God and engaged
in downright rebellion against Him (Ezekiel 25). The prophecies
concerning Tyre and Sidon contemplate heathenism in a second aspect
(Ezekiel 26-28). In Tyre we have an exhibition of pride or carnal
security, which looks away from god, and plunges deeper and deeper into
the sin and worthlessness of the natural life. Both aspects are then
finally combined in Egypt, that ancient fore of the covenant nation,
which had grown into a world-power, and while displaying in this
capacity unbending arrogance and pride, was now, like all the rest,
about to be hurled down from the summit of its ancient glory into a
bottomless deep." But this interpretation is, in more than one respect,
manifestly at variance with the substance of the prophecies. This
applies, in the first place, to the antithesis which is said to exist
between the nations threatened in Ezekiel 25 on the one hand, and Tyre
and Sidon on the other. In the case of Ammon, Moab, Edom, and the
Philistines, for example, the sins mentioned as those for which they
would be overthrown by the judgment are their malicious delight at the
fall of Israel, and their revengeful, hostile behaviour towards the
covenant nation ([Eze 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md), [Eze
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md),[Eze
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md), [Eze
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015).md). And in the same way, according
to [Eze 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#002.md), Tyre had involved itself
in guilt by giving utterance to its delight at the destruction of
Jerusalem, which inspired the hope that everything would now flow into
its own store. On the other hand, nothing more is said in the case of
Pharaoh and Egypt about malicious pleasure, or hostility, or enmity
towards Israel or the kingdom of God; but Pharaoh has rendered himself
guilty by saying: the Nile is mine, I have made it for myself; and by
the fact that Egypt had become a staff of reed to the house of Israel,
which broke when they sought to lean upon it ([Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md), [Eze
29:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006).md). According to these obvious
explanations, Ezekiel reckoned Tyre and Sidon among the nations that
were inimically disposed towards Israel, even though the hostile
attitude of the Phoenicians was dictated by different motives from those
of Edom and the other nations mentioned in Ezekiel 25; and the heathen
nations are arranged in two groups, and not in three. This is
established beyond all doubt, when we observe that each of these two
groups terminates with a promise for Israel. To the threat of judgment
uttered against Sidon there is appended the promise: and there shall be
no more for Israel a malicious briar and smarting thorn from all that
are round about them who despise them; and when the Lord shall gather
Israel from its dispersion, then will He cause it to dwell safely and
prosperously in His land, inasmuch as He will execute judgment upon all
round about them who despise them ([Eze
28:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024).md). And the prediction of
judgment upon Egypt in the last prophecy uttered concerning this land,
in the twenty-seventh year of the captivity ([Eze
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017).md), closes in a similar manner,
with the promise that at the time when the Lord gives Egypt as spoil to
the king of Babylon, He will cause a horn to grow to the house of Israel
([Eze 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#021).md). The fact that these two
prophecies correspond to each other would not have been overlooked by
the commentators if the prophecy concerning Egypt, which was really the
last in order of time, had been placed in its proper chronological
position in the book of Ezekiel, namely, at the close of the words of
God directed against that land.

The date of the great mass of these prophecies falls within the period
of the last siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, that is to say, in the
interval between Ezekiel 24 and Ezekiel 33, as the chronological data in
the headings plainly affirm. The first word concerning Tyre is from the
eleventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin ([Eze
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001).md). Of the prophecies against
Egypt, the one in Ezekiel 29:1-16 dates from the tenth month of the
tenth year; that in [Eze 30:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020.md),
from the first month of the eleventh year; that in Ezekiel 31, from the
third month of the same year; the two in [Eze
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md). and 17ff., from the twelfth
month of the twelfth year; and lastly, the brief utterance in [Eze
29:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017.md), from the twenty-seventh year
of the captivity. There are no chronological data attached to the
others. But the short, threatening words against the Ammonites,
Moabites, Edomites, and Philistines in Ezekiel 25 belong to the time
immediately succeeding the fall of Jerusalem, since they presuppose its
having occurred. The second and third utterances concerning Tyre in
Ezekiel 27 and Ezekiel 28:1-19, as well as that concerning Sidon in [Eze
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#020.md)., are closely connected, so far
as their contents are concerned, with the first word of God against Tyre
belonging to the eleventh year of the captivity. And lastly, the
threatening word concerning Egypt in Ezekiel 30:1-19, to which no
definite chronological data are attached, appears to stand nearer in
point of time to Ezekiel 29:1-16 than to [Eze
29:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017.md). - Consequently the
arrangement is based upon the subject-matter of the prophecies, and the
chronological sequence is kept subordinate to this, or rather to the
comparative importance of the several nations in relation to the
theocracy.

These prophecies evidently rest upon the predictions of the earlier
prophets against the same nations, so far as their contents are
concerned; and in the threats directed against Tyre and Egypt, more
especially, many of the thoughts contained in the prophecies of Isaiah
(Isa 23 and 19) are reproduced and expanded. But notwithstanding this
resting upon the utterances of earlier prophets, Ezekiel's prophecy
against the heathen nations is distinguished in a characteristic manner
from that of the other prophets, by the fact that he does not say a word
about the prospect of these nations being ultimately pardoned, or of the
remnant of them being converted to the Lord, but stops with the
announcement of the utter destruction of the earthly and temporal
condition of all these kingdoms and nations. The prophecy concerning
Egypt in [Eze 29:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013.md), to the effect
that after forty years of chastisement God will turn its captivity, and
gather it together again, is only an apparent and not a real exception
to this; for this turning of the judgment is not to bring about a
restoration of Egypt to its former might and greatness or its
glorification in the future; but, according to [Eze
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#014.md)., is simply to restore a lowly
and impotent kingdom, which will offer no inducement to Israel to rely
upon its strength. Through this promise, therefore, the threat of
complete destruction is only somewhat modified, but by no means
withdrawn. The only thing which Ezekiel positively holds out to view
before the seven heathen nations is, that in consequence of the judgment
falling upon them, they will learn that God is Jehovah, or the Lord.
This formula regularly returns in the case of all the nations (vid.,
[Eze 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005.md), [Eze
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#007.md),[Eze
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#011.md), [Eze
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#017.md); [Eze
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#006.md); [Eze
28:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#022.md); [Eze
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006.md), [Eze
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#009.md); [Eze
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#008.md), [Eze
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#019.md), [Eze
30:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#025.md); [Eze
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#015).md); and we might take it to mean,
that through the judgment of their destruction in a temporal respect,
these nations will come to the knowledge of the God of salvation. And
with this interpretation it would contain a slight allusion to the
salvation, which will flourish in consequence of and after the judgment,
in the case of those who have escaped destruction. If, however, we
consider, on the one hand, that in the case of Edom ([Eze
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#014).md) the formula takes a harsher
form, namely, not that they shall know Jehovah, but that they shall
experience His vengeance; and, on the other hand, that the mighty Tyre
is repeatedly threatened with destruction, even eternal extinction ([Eze
26:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020.md); [Eze
27:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#036.md); [Eze
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#019).md), and that the whole cycle of
these prophecies closes with a funeral-dirge on the descent of all the
heathen nations into Sheol (Ezekiel 32:17-32), - we shall see that the
formula in question cannot be taken in the sense indicated above, as
Kliefoth maintains, but must be understood as signifying that these
nations will discern in their destruction the punitive righteousness of
God, so that it presents no prospect of future salvation, but simply
increases the force of the threat. There is nothing in this distinction,
however, to establish a discrepancy between Ezekiel and the earlier
prophets; for Ezekiel simply fixes his eye upon the judgment, which will
fall upon the heathen nations, partly on account of their hostile
attitude towards the kingdom of God, and partly on account of their
deification of their own might, and is silent as to the salvation which
will accrue even to them out of the judgment itself, but without in the
least degree denying it. The reason for his doing this is not that the
contemplation of the particular features, which form the details of the
immediate fulfilment, has led him to avert his eye from the more
comprehensive survey of the entire future;

(Note: Drechsler (in his commentary on BIBLE:Isaiah 23) has given the
following explanation of the distinction to be observed between the
prophecies of Isaiah and those of Ezekiel concerning Tyre, - namely,
that in the case of Isaiah the spirit of prophecy invests its utterances
with the character of totality, in accordance with the position assigned
to this prophet at the entrance upon a new era of the world, embracing
the entire future even to the remotest times, and sketching with grand
simplicity the ground-plan and outline of the whole; whereas in the case
of the later prophets, such as Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who were living in
the midst of the historical execution, the survey of the whole gives
place to the contemplation of particular features belonging to the
details of the immediate fulfilment. But this explanation is not
satisfactory, inasmuch as Jeremiah, notwithstanding the fact that he
lived in the midst of the execution of the judgment, foretold the
turning of judgment into salvation at least in the case of some of the
heathen nations. For example, in Isa. 48:47 he prophesies to the
Moabites, and in [Isa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006.md) to the
Ammonites, that in the future time Jehovah will turn their captivity;
and in [Isa 46:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md) :26 he says,
concerning Egypt, that after the judgment it will be inhabited as in the
days of old.)

but that the proclamation of the spread of salvation among the heathen
lay outside the limits of the calling which he had received from the
Spirit of God. The prophetic mission of Ezekiel was restricted to the
remnant of the covenant nation, which was carried into exile, and
scattered among the heathen. To this remnant he was to foretell the
destruction of the kingdom of Judah, and after the occurrence of that
catastrophe the preservation and eventual restoration of the kingdom of
God in a renewed and glorified form. With this commission, which he had
received from the Lord, there was associated, it is true, the
announcement of judgment upon the heathen, inasmuch as such an
announcement was well fitted to preserve from despair the Israelites,
who were pining under the oppression of the heathen, and to revive the
hope of the fulfilment of the promise held out before the penitent of
their future redemption from their state of misery and restoration to
the position of the people of God. But this would not apply to the
prophecies of the reception of the heathen into the renovated kingdom of
God, as they contained no special element of consolation to the covenant
people in their depression.

In connection with this we have the equally striking circumstance, that
Ezekiel does not mention Babylon among the heathen nations. This may
also be explained, not merely from the predominance of the idea of the
judgment upon Israel and Jerusalem, which the Chaldeans were to execute
as "righteous men" ([Eze 23:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#045).md), so
that they only came before him as such righteous men, and not as a
world-power also (Kliefoth), but chiefly from the fact that, for the
reason described above, Ezekiel's prophecy of the judgment upon the
heathen is restricted to those nations which had hitherto cherished and
displayed either enmity or false friendship toward Israel, and the
Chaldeans were not then reckoned among the number. - For the further
development of the prophecy concerning the future of the whole heathen
world, the Lord had called the prophet Daniel at the same time as
Ezekiel, and assigned him his post at the seat of the existing heathen
imperial power.

[Ezekiel 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 25:1</span></span>

Against the Ammonites

[Eze 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001.md). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#002.md). Son of
man, direct thy face towards the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against
them, [Eze 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md). And say to the sons
of Ammon, Hear ye the word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Because thou sayest, Aha! concerning my sanctuary, that it is
profaned; and concerning the land of Israel, that it is laid waste; and
concerning the house of Judah, that they have gone into captivity; [Eze
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md). Therefore, behold, I will give
thee to the sons of the east for a possession, that they may pitch their
tent-villages in thee, and erect their dwellings in thee; they shall eat
thy fruits, and they shall drink thy milk. [Eze
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005.md). And Rabbah will I make a
camel-ground, and the sons of Ammon a resting-place for flocks; and ye
shall know that I am Jehovah. [Eze
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006.md). For thus saith the Lord Jehovah,
Because thou hast clapped thy hand, and stamped with thy foot, and hast
rejoiced in soul with all thy contempt concerning the house of Israel,
[Eze 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#007.md). Therefore, behold, I will
stretch out my hand against thee, and give thee to the nations for
booty, and cut thee off from the peoples, and exterminate thee from the
lands; I will destroy thee, that thou mayst learn that I am Jehovah. -
In [Eze 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028.md)., when predicting the
expedition of Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem, Ezekiel had already
foretold the destruction of the Ammonites, so that these verses are
simply a resumption and confirmation of the earlier prophecy. In the
passage referred to, Ezekiel, like Zephaniah before him ([Zep
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008.md), [Zep
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#010).md), mentions their reviling of the
people of God as the sin for which they are to be punished with
destruction. This reviling, in which their hatred of the divine calling
of Israel found vent, was the radical sin of Ammon. On the occasion of
Judah's fall, it rose even to contemptuous and malicious joy at the
profanation of the sanctuary of Jehovah by the destruction of the temple
(a comparison with [Eze 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021.md) will
show that this is the sense in which נחל is to be understood), at the
devastation of the land of Israel, and at the captivity of Judah, - in
other words, at the destruction of the religious and political existence
of Israel as the people of God. The profanation of the sanctuary is
mentioned first, to intimate that the hostility to Israel, manifested by
the Ammonites on every occasion that presented itself (for proofs, see
the comm. on [Zep 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008).md), had its roots
not so much in national antipathies, as in antagonism to the sacred
calling of Israel. As a punishment for this, they are not only to lose
their land ([Eze 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md) and [Eze
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005).md), but to be cut off from the
number of the nations ([Eze 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006.md) and
[Eze 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#007).md). The Lord will give up
their land, with its productions, for a possession to the sons of the
east, i.e., according to [Gen
25:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#013.md), to the Arabs, the Bedouins
(for בּני קדם, see the comm. on [Jdg
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003.md) and [Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003).md). The Piel ישּׁבוּ, although only
occurring here, is not to be rejected as critically suspicious, and to
be changed into Kal, as Hitzig proposes. The Kal would be unsuitable,
because the subject of the sentence can only be בּני קדם, and not
טירותיהם; and ישׁב in the Kal has an intransitive sense. For טירות,
tent-villages of nomads, see the comm. on [Gen
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#016.md). משׁכּנים, dwellings, are the
separate tents of the shepherds. In the last clauses of [Eze
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md), המּה is repeated for the sake of
emphasis; and Hitzig's opinion, that the first המּה corresponds to the
subject in the clause 'וישּׁבוּ וגו, the second to that in ונתנוּ, is to
be rejected as a marvellous flight of imagination, which approaches
absurdity in the assertion that פּרי הארץ signifies the folds, i.e., the
animals, of the land. Along with the fruit of the land, i.e., the
produce of the soil, milk is also mentioned as a production of pastoral
life, and the principal food of nomads. On the wealth of the Ammonites
in flocks and herds, see [Jdg 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005.md). The
words are addressed to Ammon, as a land or kingdom, and hence the
feminine suffix. The capital will also share the fate of the land.
Rabbah (see the comm. on [Deu 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011).md)
will become a camel-ground, a waste spot where camels lie down and feed.
This has been almost literally fulfilled. The ruins of Ammn are deserted
by men, and Seetzen found Arabs with their camels not far off (vid., von
Raumer, Palestine, p. 268). In the parallel clause, the sons of Ammon,
i.e., the Ammonites, are mentioned instead of their land.

In [Eze 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006.md) and [Eze
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#007.md), the Lord announces to the nation
of the Ammonites the destruction that awaits them, and reiterates with
still stronger emphasis the sin which occasioned it, namely, the
malicious delight they had manifested at Israel's fall. בּכל־שׁאטך is
strengthened by בּנפשׁ: with all thy contempt in the soul, i.e., with
all the contempt which thy soul could cherish. In [Eze
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#007.md) the ἁπ λεγ.. לבג occasions some
difficulty. The Keri has substituted לבז, for booty for the nations (cf.
[Eze 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#005).md); and all the ancient
versions have adopted this. Consequently בּג might be a copyist's error
for בּז; and in support of this the circumstance might be adduced, that
in [Eze 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md), where גּה stands for
זה, we have unquestionably a substitution of ג for ז. But if the Chetib
בז be correct, the word is to be explained - as it has been by Benfey
(Die Montasnamen, p. 194) and Gildemeister (in Lassen's Zeitschrift fr
die Kunde des Morgenlandes, iv. 1, p. 213ff.) - from the Sanscrit
bha=ga, pars, portio, and has passed into the Semitic languages from the
Aryan, like the Syriac bagaa', esca, which P. Boetticher (Horae aram. p.
21) has correctly traced to the Sanscrit bhaj, conquere. - The executors
of the judgment are not named; for the threat that God will give up the
land of the Ammonites to the Bedouins for their possession, does not
imply that they are to exterminate the Ammonites. On the contrary, a
comparison of this passage with [Amo
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md) and [Jer
49:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md), where the Ammonites are
threatened not only with the devastation of their land, but also with
transportation into exile, will show that the Chaldeans are to be
thought of as executing the judgment. (See the comm. on [Eze
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#011)..md)

[Ezekiel 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 25:8</span></span>

Against the Moabites

[Eze 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md). Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Because Moab, like Seir, saith, Behold, like all other nations
is the house of Judah: [Eze 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009.md).
Therefore, behold, I will open the shoulder of Moab from the cities,
from its cities even to the last, the ornament of the land,
Beth-hayeshimoth, Baal-meon, and as far as Kiryathaim, [Eze
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#010.md). To the sons of the east,
together with the sons of Ammon, and will give it for a possession, that
the sons of Ammon may no more be remembered among the nations. [Eze
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#011.md). Upon Moab will I execute
judgments; and they shall learn that I am Jehovah. - Moab has become
guilty of the same sin against Judah, the people of God, as Ammon,
namely, of misunderstanding and despising the divine election of Israel.
Ammon gave expression to this, when Judah was overthrown, in the
malicious assertion that the house of Judah was like all the heathen
nations, - that is to say, had no pre-eminence over them, and shared the
same fate as they. There is something remarkable in the allusion to
Seir, i.e., Edom, in connection with Moab, inasmuch as no reference is
made to it in the threat contained in [Eze
25:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009.md); and in [Eze
25:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md), there follows a separate
prediction concerning Edom. Hitzig therefore proposes to follow the
example of the lxx, and erase it from the text as a gloss, but without
being able in the smallest degree to show in what way it is probable
that such a gloss could have found admission into an obviously
unsuitable place. Seir is mentioned along with Moab to mark the feeling
expressed in the words of Moab as springing, like the enmity of Edom
towards Israel, from hatred and envy of the spiritual birthright of
Israel, i.e., of its peculiar prerogatives in sacred history. As a
punishment for this, Moab was to be given up, like Ammon, to the
Bedouins for their possession, and the people of the Moabites were to
disappear from the number of the nations. [Eze
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009.md) and [Eze
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#010.md) form one period, לבני קדם in
[Eze 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#010.md) being governed by פּתח in
[Eze 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009.md). The shoulder of Moab is the
side of the Moabitish land. In the application of the word כּתף to lands
or provinces, regard is had to the position of the shoulder in relation
to the whole body, but without reference to the elevation of the
district. We find an analogy to this in the use of כּתף in connection
with the sides of a building. In 'מהערים וגו' , the מן cannot be taken,
in a privative sense, for מהיות; for neither the article הערים, nor the
more emphatic מעריו מקּצהוּ, allows this; but מן indicates the
direction, "from the cities onwards," "from its cities onwards,
reckoning to the very last," - that is to say, in its whole extent.
מקּצהוּ, as in [Isa 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011.md); [Gen
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#004.md), etc. This tract of land is first
of all designated as a glorious land, with reference to its worth as a
possession on account of the excellence of its soil for the rearing of
cattle (see the comm. on [Num 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#004).md),
and then defined with geographical minuteness by the introduction of the
names of some of its cities. Beth-Hayeshimoth, i.e., house of wastes
(see the comm. on [Num 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001).md), has
probably been preserved in the ruins of Suaime, which F. de Saulcy
discovered on the north-eastern border of the Dead Sea, a little farther
inland (vid., Voyage en terre sainte, Paris 1865, t. i. p. 315).
Baal-meon, - when written fully, Beth-Baal-Meon ([Jos
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017).md) - contracted into Beth-Meon in
[Jer 48:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#023.md), is to be sought for to the
south-east of this, in the ruins of Myun, three-quarters of an hour's
journey to the south of Heshbon (see the comm. on [Num
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038).md). Kiryathaim was still farther
south, probably on the site of the ruins of El Teym (see the comm. on
[Gen 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md) and [Num
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#037).md). The Chetib קריתמה is based
upon the form קריתם, a secondary form of קריתים , like דּתן, a secondary
form of דּתין, in [Kg2 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#013.md). The
cities named were situated to the north of the Arnon, in that portion of
the Moabitish land which had been taken from the Moabites by the
Amorites before the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan ([Num
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013.md), [Num
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026).md), and was given to the tribe of
Reuben for its inheritance after the defeat of the Amoritish kings by
the Israelites; and then, still later, when the tribes beyond the Jordan
were carried into captivity by the Assyrians, came into the possession
of the Moabites again, as is evident from [Isa
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md) and [Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md), and [Jer
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md), [Jer
48:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#023.md), where these cities are
mentioned once more among the cities of the Moabites. This will explain
not only the naming of this particular district of the Moabitish
country, but the definition, "from its cities." For the fact upon which
the stress is laid in the passage before us is, that the land in
question rightfully belonged to the Israelites, according to [Num
32:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#037.md); [Num
33:49](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#049.md); [Jos
12:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002.md); [Jos
13:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#020.md), and that it was therefore
unlawfully usurped by the Moabites after the deportation of the
trans-Jordanic tribes; and the thought is this, that the judgment would
burst upon Moab from this land and these cities, and they would thereby
be destroyed (Hvernick and Kliefoth). על, not "over the sons of Ammon,"
but "in addition to the sons of Ammon." They, that is to say, their
land, had already been promised to the sons of the east ([Eze
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004).md). In addition to this, they are
now to receive Moab for their possession (Hitzig and Kliefoth). Thus
will the Lord execute judgments upon Moab. [Eze
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#011.md) sums up what is affirmed
concerning Moab in [Eze 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009.md) and [Eze
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#010.md), in the one idea of the
judgments of God upon this people.

The execution of these judgments commenced with the subjugation of the
Ammonites and Moabites by Nebuchadnezzar, five years after the
destruction of Jerusalem (vid., Josephus, Antt. x. 9. 7, and M. von
Niebuhr, Gesch. Assurs, etc., p. 215). Nevertheless the Ammonites
continued to exist as a nation for a long time after the captivity, so
that Judas the Maccabaean waged war against them (1 Macc. 5:6, 30-43);
and even Justin Martyr speaks of ̓Αμμανιτῶν νῦν πολὺ πληθος (Dial.
Tryph. p. 272). - But Origen includes their land in the general name of
Arabia (lib. i. in Job). The name of the Moabites appears to have become
extinct at a much earlier period. After the captivity, it is only in
[Ezr 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md); [Neh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001.md), and [Dan
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041.md), that we find any notice of them
as a people. Their land is mentioned by Josephus in the Antiq. xiii. 14.
2, and xv. 4, and in the Bell. Jud. iii. 3. 3. - A further fulfilment by
the Messianic judgment, which is referred to in [Zep
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#010.md), is not indicated in these words
of Ezekiel; but judging from the prophecy concerning the Edomites (see
the comm. on [Eze 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#014).md), it is not to
be excluded.

Against the Edomites

[Eze 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md). Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Because Edom acteth revengefully towards the house of Judah,
and hath been very guilty in avenging itself upon them, [Eze
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#013.md). Therefore, thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand over Edom, and cut off man and beast
from it, and make it a desert from Teman, and unto Dedan they shall fall
by the sword. [Eze 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#014.md). And I will
inflict my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, that
they may do to Edom according to my anger and my wrath; and they shall
experience my vengeance, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - Whilst the
Ammonites and the Moabites are charged with nothing more than malicious
pleasure at the fall of Israel, and disregard of its divine calling, the
Edomites are reproached with revengeful acts of hostility towards the
house of Judah, and threatened with extermination in consequence. The
עשׂות, doing or acting of Edom, is more precisely defined as 'בּנקום
וגו, i.e., as consisting in the taking of vengeance, and designated as
very guilty, ישׁמוּ אשׁום. עשׂה, followed by בּ with an infinitive, as
in [Eze 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017.md). Edom had sought every
opportunity of acting thus revengefully towards Israel (vid., [Oba
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011.md); [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011).md), so that in [Eze
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005.md) Ezekiel speaks of the "eternal
enmity" of Edom against Israel. For this reason we must not restrict the
reproach in [Eze 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md) to particular
outbreaks of this revenge at the time of the devastation and destruction
of Judah by the Chaldeans, of which the Psalmist complains in [Psa
137:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md), and for which he invokes the
vengeance of God upon Edom. Man and beast are to be cut off from Edom in
consequence, and the land to become a desert from Teman to Dedan. These
names denote not cities, but districts. Teman is the southern portion of
Idumaea (see the comm. on [Amo 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012).md);
and Dedan is therefore the northern district. Dedan is probably not the
Cushite tribe mentioned in [Gen 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007.md),
but the tribe of the same name which sprang from the sons of Abraham by
Keturah ([Gen 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003).md), and which is also
mentioned in [Jer 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008.md) in connection
with Edom. דּדנה has ה local with Seghol instead of Kametz, probably on
account of the preceding a (vid., Ewald, 216c). There is no necessity to
connect מתּימן with the following clause, as Hitzig and Kliefoth have
done, in opposition to the accents. The two geographical names, which
are used as a periphrasis for Idumaea as a whole, are distributed
equally through the parallelismus membrorum between the two clauses of
the sentence, so that they belong to both clauses, so far as the sense
is concerned. Edom is to become a desert from Teman to Dedan, and its
inhabitants from Teman to Dedan are to fall by the sword. This judgment
of vengeance will be executed by God through His people Israel. The
fulfilment of this threat, no doubt, commenced with the subjugation of
the Edomites by the Maccabees; but it is not to be limited to that
event, as Rosenmller, Kliefoth, and others suppose, although the
foundation was thereby laid for the disappearance of the national
existence of Edom. For it is impossible with this limitation to do
justice to the emphatic expression, "my people Israel." On the ground,
therefore, of the prophecies in [Amo
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md) and [Oba
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017.md), that the people of God are to
take possession of Edom, when the fallen tabernacle of David is raised
up again, i.e., in the Messianic times, which prophecies point back to
that of Balaam in [Num 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018.md), and have
their roots, as this also has, in the promise of God concerning the twin
sons of Isaac, "the elder shall serve the younger" ([Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023).md), we must seek for the complete
fulfilment in the victories of the people of God over all their foes,
among whom Edom from time immemorial had taken the leading place, at the
time when the kingdom of God is perfected. For even here Edom is not
introduced merely as a single nation that was peculiarly hostile to
Judah, but also as a type of the implacable enmity of the heathen world
towards the people and kingdom of God, as in [Eze
35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md), Isa. 34:63, etc. The
vengeance, answering to the anger and wrath of Jehovah, which Israel, as
the people of God, is to execute upon Edom, consists not merely in the
annihilation of the national existence of Edom, which John Hyrcanus
carried into effect by compelling the subjugated Edomites to adopt
circumcision (see the comm. on [Num
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018).md), but chiefly in the wrathful
judgment which Israel will execute in the person of Christ upon the
arch-enemy of the kingdom of God by its complete extinction.

[Ezekiel 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015.md)

Against the Philistines

[Eze 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015.md). Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Because the Philistines act with revenge, and avenge themselves
with contempt in the soul to destroy in everlasting enmity, [Eze
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016.md). Therefore thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand over the Philistines, and
cut off the Cretans, and destroy the remnant by the seashore. [Eze
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#017.md). And I will execute great
vengeance upon them through chastisements of wrath, and they shall know
that I am Jehovah, when I bring my vengeance upon them. - The
Philistines resembled the Edomites and Ammonites in their disposition
towards the covenant nation, the former in their thirst for revenge, the
latter in their malicious rejoicing at Israel's fall. For this reason
they had already been classed by Isaiah ([Isa
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014).md) with Edom, Moab, and Ammon as
enemies, who would be successfully attacked and overcome by Israel, when
the Lord had gathered it again from its dispersion. In the description
of its sin towards Israel we have a combination of elements taken from
the conduct of Edom and Ammon (vv. 12 and 6). They execute revenge with
contempt in the soul (שׁאט בּנפשׁ, as in v. 6), with the intention to
destroy (למשׁחית) Israel; and this revenge springs from eternal,
never-ending hostility. The Lord will cut off the whole of the people of
the Philistines for this. כּרתים, Cretans, originally a branch of the
Philistian people, settled in the south-west of Canaan. The name is used
by Ezekiel for the people, as it had already been by Zephaniah ([Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005).md), for the sake of the paronomasia
with הכרתּי. The origin of the name is involved in obscurity, as the
current derivation from Creta rests upon a very doubtful combination
(cf. Stark, Gaza, pp. 66 and 99ff.). By the "remnant of the sea-coast,"
i.e., the remnant of the inhabitants of the coast of the Mediterranean,
in other words, of the Philistines, the destruction of which had already
been predicted by Amos ([Amo 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008).md),
Isaiah ([Isa 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030).md), and Jeremiah
([Jer 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004).md), we are to understand the
whole nation to the very last man, all that was still left of the
Philistines (see the comm. on [Amo
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008).md). - The execution of the vengeance
threatened by God began in the Chaldean period, in which Gaza was
attacked by Pharaoh, and, judging from [Jer
47:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md), the whole of Philistia was
laid waste by the Chaldeans (see the fuller comments on this in the
exposition of [Jer 47:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001).md). But the
ultimate fulfilment will take place in the case of Philistia also,
through the Messianic judgment, in the manner described in the
commentary on [Zep 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#010.md).
