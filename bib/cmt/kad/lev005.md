### [Leviticus Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 5:1</span></span>

There follow here three special examples of sin on the part of the
common Israelite, all sins of omission and rashness of a lighter kind
than the cases mentioned in [Lev
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027.md).; in which, therefore, if the
person for whom expiation was to be made was in needy circumstances,
instead of a goat or ewe-sheep, a pair of doves could be received as a
sacrificial gift, or, in cases of still greater poverty, the tenth of an
ephah of fine flour. The following were the cases. The first ([Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001).md), when any one had heard the voice
of an oath (an oath spoken aloud) and was a witness, i.e., was in a
condition to give evidence, whether he had seen what took place or had
learned it, that is to say, had come to the knowledge of it in some
other way. In this case, if he did not make it known, he was to bear his
offence, i.e., to bear the guilt, which he had contracted by omitting to
make it known, with all its consequences. אלה does not mean a curse in
general, but an oath, as an imprecation upon one's self (= the "oath of
cursing" in [Num 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#021).md); and the sin
referred to did not consist in the fact that a person heard a curse,
imprecation, or blasphemy, and gave no evidence of it (for neither the
expression "and is a witness," nor the words "hath seen or known of it,"
are in harmony with this), but in the fact that one who knew of
another's crime, whether he had seen it, or had come to the certain
knowledge of it in any other way, and was therefore qualified to appear
in court as a witness for the conviction of the criminal, neglected to
do so, and did not state what he had seen or learned, when he heard the
solemn adjuration of the judge at the public investigation of the crime,
by which all persons present, who knew anything of the matter, were
urged to come forward as witnesses (vid., Oehler in Herzog's Cycl.). עון
נשׁא, to bear the offence or sin, i.e., to take away and endure its
consequences (see [Gen 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013).md), whether
they consisted in chastisements and judgments, by which God punished the
sin ([Lev 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#018.md); [Lev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#016.md); [Lev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017).md), such as diseases or distress
([Num 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#031.md); [Num
14:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033).md), childlessness ([Lev
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#020).md), death ([Lev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#009).md), or extermination ([Lev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#008.md); [Lev
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017.md); [Lev
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#013).md), or in punishment inflicted by
men ([Lev 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#015).md), or whether they
could be expiated by sin-offerings (as in this passage and [Lev
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017).md) and other kinds of atonement. In
this sense חמא נשׂא is also sometimes used (see at [Lev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017).md).

[Lev 5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#002.md)

The second was, if any one had touched the carcase of an unclean beast,
or cattle, or creeping thing, or the uncleanness of a man of any kind
whatever ("with regard to all his uncleanness, with which he defiles
himself," i.e., any kind of defilement to which a man is exposed), and
"it is hidden from him," sc., the uncleanness or defilement; that is to
say, if he had unconsciously defiled himself by touching unclean
objects, and had consequently neglected the purification prescribed for
such cases. In this case, if he found it out afterwards, he had
contracted guilt which needed expiation.

[Lev 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004.md)

The third was, if any one should "swear to prate with the lips," i.e.,
swear in idle, empty words of the lips, - "to do good or evil," i.e.,
that he would do anything whatever ([Num
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#013.md); [Isa
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023).md), - "with regard to all that he
speaks idly with an oath," i.e., if it related to something which a man
had affirmed with an oath in thoughtless conversation, - "and it is
hidden from him," i.e., if he did not reflect that he might commit sin
by such thoughtless swearing, and if he perceived it afterwards and
discovered his sin, and had incurred guilt with regard to one of the
things which he had thoughtlessly sworn.

[Lev 5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#005.md)

If any one therefore (the three cases enumerated are comprehended under
the one expression כי והיה, for the purpose of introducing the apodosis)
had contracted guilt with reference to one of these (the things named in
[Lev 5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001).md), and confessed in what he
had sinned, he was to offer as his guilt (trespass) to the Lord, for the
sin which he had sinned, a female from the flock-for a sin-offering,
that the priest might make atonement for him on account of his sin. אשׁם
([Lev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#006).md) does not mean either
guilt-offering or debitum (Knobel), but culpa, delictum, reatus, as in
[Lev 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007.md) : "as his guilt," i.e., for
the expiation of his guilt, which he had brought upon himself.

[Lev 5:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007.md)

"But if his hand does not reach what is sufficient for a sheep," i.e.,
if he could not afford enough to sacrifice a sheep ("his hand" is put
for what his hand acquires), he was to bring two turtle-doves or two
young pigeons, one for the sin-offering, the other for the
burnt-offering. The pigeon intended for the sin, i.e., for the
sin-offering, he was to bring first of all to the priest, who was to
offer it in the following manner. The head was to be pinched off from
opposite to its neck, i.e., in the nape just below the head, though
without entirely severing it, that is to say, it was to be pinched off
sufficiently to kill the bird and allow the blood to flow out. He was
then to sprinkle of the blood upon the wall of the altar, which could be
effected by swinging the bleeding pigeon, and to squeeze out the rest of
the blood against the wall of the altar, because it was a sin-offering;
for in the burnt-offering he let all the blood flow out against the wall
of the altar ([Lev 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#015).md). What more
was done with the pigeon is not stated. Hence it cannot be decided with
certainty, whether, after the crop and its contents were removed and
thrown upon the ash-heap, the whole of the bird was burned upon the
altar, or whether it fell to the priest, as the Mishnah affirms (Seb.
vi. 4), so that none of it was placed upon the altar. One circumstance
which seems to favour the statement in the Talmud is the fact, that in
the sin-offering of pigeons, a second pigeon was to be offered as a
burnt-offering, and, according to [Lev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#010.md), for the purpose of making an
atonement; probably for no other purpose than to burn it upon the altar,
as the dove of the sin-offering was not burned, and the sacrifice was
incomplete without some offering upon the altar. In the case of
sin-offerings of quadrupeds, the fat portions were laid upon the altar,
and the flesh could be eaten by the priest by virtue of his office; but
in that of pigeons, it was not possible to separate fat portions from
the flesh for the purpose of burning upon the altar by themselves, and
it would not do to divide the bird in half, and let one half be burned
and the other eaten by the priest, as this would have associated the
idea of halfness or incompleteness with the sacrifice. A second pigeon
was therefore to be sacrificed as a burnt-offering, כּמּשׂפּט, according
to the right laid down in [Lev 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#014.md).,
that the priest might make atonement for the offerer on account of his
sin, whereas in the sin-offering of a quadruped one sacrificial animal
was sufficient to complete the expiation.

(Note: From the instructions to offer two pigeons in order to obtain
expiation, it is perfectly evident that the eating of the flesh of the
sin-offering on the part of the priest formed an essential part of the
act of expiation, and was not merely a kind of honourable tribute, which
God awarded to His servants who officiated at the sacrifice.)

[Lev 5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011.md)

But if any one could not afford even two pigeons, he was to offer the
tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin-offering. ידו תּשּׂיג for ידו
תּגּיע ([Lev 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007).md): his hand reaches to
anything, is able to raise it, or with an accusative, obtains, gets
anything (used in the same sense in [Lev
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#030.md), [Lev
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#031).md), or else absolutely, acquires,
or gets rich ([Lev 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#026.md), [Lev
25:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#047).md). But it was to be offered
without oil and incense, because it was a sin-offering, that is to say,
"because it was not to have the character of a minchah" (Oehler). But
the reason why it was not to have this character was, that only those
who were in a state of grace could offer a minchah, and not a man who
had fallen from grace through sin. As such a man could not offer to the
Lord the fruits of the Spirit of God and of prayer, he was not allowed
to add oil and incense, as symbols of the Spirit and praise of God, to
the sacrifice with which he sought the forgiveness of sin. The priest
was to take a handful of the meal offered, and burn it upon the altar as
a memorial, and thus make atonement for the sinner on account of his
sin. - On "his handful" and "a memorial" (Azcarah), see [Lev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002.md). "In one of these" ([Lev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#013.md) as in [Lev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#005).md): cf. [Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md). "And let it (the remainder of the
meal offered) belong to the priest like the meat-offering:" i.e., as
being most holy ([Lev 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003).md).

[Leviticus 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 5:14</span></span>

(Ch. 5:14-6:7)

(Note: In the original the division of verses in the Hebrew text is
followed; but we have thought it better to keep to the arrangement
adopted in our English version. - Tr.)

The Trespass-Offerings. - These were presented for special sins, by
which a person had contracted guilt, and therefore they are not included
in the general festal sacrifices. Three kinds of offences are mentioned
in this section as requiring trespass-offerings. The first is, "if a
soul commit a breach of trust, and sin in going wrong in the holy gifts
of Jehovah." מעל, lit., to cover, hence מעיל the cloak, over-coat,
signifies to act secretly, unfaithfully, especially against Jehovah,
either by falling away from Him into idolatry, by which the fitting
honour was withheld from Jehovah ([Lev
26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md); [Deu
32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051.md); [Jos
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#016).md), or by infringing upon His
rights, abstracting something that rightfully belonged to Him. Thus in
[Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001.md); [Jos
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#020.md), it is applied to fraud in
relation to that which had been put under the ban; and in [Num
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#012.md), [Num
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#027.md),it is also applied to a married
woman's unfaithfulness to her husband: so that sin was called מעל, when
regarded as a violation of existing rights. "The holy things of Jehovah"
were the holy gifts, sacrifices, first-fruits, tithes, etc., which were
to be offered to Jehovah, and were assigned by Him to the priests for
their revenue (see [Lev 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#022).md). חטא
with מן is constructio praegnans: to sin in anything by taking away from
Jehovah that which belonged to Him. בּשׁגגה, in error (see [Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002).md): i.e., in a forgetful or
negligent way. Whoever sinned in this way was to offer to the Lord as
his guilt (see [Lev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#006).md) a ram from
the flock without blemish for a trespass-offering (lit.,
guilt-offering), according to the estimate of Moses, whose place was
afterwards taken by the officiating priest ([Lev
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#012.md); [Num
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016).md). שׁקלים כּסף "money of
shekels," i.e., several shekels in amount, which Abenezra and others
have explained, no doubt correctly, as meaning that the ram was to be
worth more than one shekel, two shekels at least. The expression is
probably kept indefinite, for the purpose of leaving some margin for the
valuation, so that there might be a certain proportion between the value
of the ram and the magnitude of the trespass committed (see Oehler ut
sup. p. 645). "In the holy shekel:" see [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md). At the same time, the culprit
was to make compensation for the fraud committed in the holy thing, and
add a fifth (of the value) over, as in the case of the redemption of the
first-born, of the vegetable tithe, or of what had been vowed to God
([Lev 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#027.md), [Lev
27:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#031.md), and [Lev
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#013.md), [Lev
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#015.md), [Lev
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#019).md). The ceremony to be observed in
the offering of the ram is described in [Lev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md). It was the same as that of the
sin-offerings, whose blood was not brought into the holy place, except
with regard to the sprinkling of the blood, and in this the
trespass-offering resembled the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.

The second case ([Lev 5:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017).md), from
its very position between the other two, which both refer to the
violation of rights, must belong to the same category; although the sin
is introduced with the formula used in [Lev
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027.md) in connection with those sins
which were to be expiated by a sin-offering. But the violation of right
can only have consisted in an invasion of Jehovah's rights with regard
to Israel, and not, as Knobel supposes, in an invasion of the rights of
private Israelites, as distinguished from the priests; an antithesis of
which there is not the slightest indication. This is evident from the
fact, that the case before us is linked on to the previous one without
anything intervening; whereas the next case, which treats of the
violation of the rights of a neighbour, is separated by a special
introductory formula. The expression, "and wist it not," refers to
ignorance of the sin, and not of the divine commands; as may be clearly
seen from [Lev 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#018.md) : "the priest
shall make an atonement for him concerning his error, which he committed
without knowing it." The trespass-offering was the same as in the former
case, and was also to be valued by the priest; but no compensation is
mentioned, probably because the violation of right, which consisted in
the transgression of one of the commands of God, was of such a kind as
not to allow of material compensation. The third case ([Lev
6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#001).md) is distinguished from the other
two by a new introductory formula. The sin and unfaithfulness to Jehovah
are manifested in this case in a violation of the rights of a neighbour.
"If a man deny to his neighbour (כּחשׁ with a double ב obj., to deny a
thing to a person) a pikkadon (i.e., a deposit, a thing entrusted to him
to keep, [Gen 41:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#036).md), or יד תּשׂוּמת,
"a thing placed in his hand" (handed over to him as a pledge) "or גּזל,
a thing robbed" (i.e., the property of a neighbour unjustly
appropriated, whether a well, a field, or cattle, [Gen
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#025.md); [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002.md); [Job
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#002).md), "or if he have oppressed his
neighbour" (i.e., forced something from him or withheld it unjustly,
[Lev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#013.md); [Deu
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014.md); [Jos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#008.md); [Mal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005).md), "or have found a lost thing and
denies it, and thereby swears to his lie" (i.e., rests his oath upon a
lie), "on account of one of all that a man is accustomed to do to sin
therewith:" the false swearing here refers not merely to a denial of
what is found, but to all the crimes mentioned, which originated in
avarice and selfishness, but through the false swearing became frauds
against Jehovah, adding guilt towards God to the injustice done to the
neighbour, and requiring, therefore, not only that a material
restitution should be made to the neighbour, but that compensation
should be made to God as well. Whatever had been robbed, or taken by
force, or entrusted or found, and anything about which a man had sworn
falsely ([Lev 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#004.md), [Lev
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#005).md), was to be restored "according to
its sum" (cf. [Exo 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012.md); [Num
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#002), etc..md), i.e., in its full value;
beside which, he was to "add its fifths" (on the plural, see Ges. 87, 2;
Ew. 186 e), i.e., in every one of the things abstracted or withheld
unjustly the fifth part of the value was to be added to the full amount
(as in [Lev 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016).md). "To him to whom it
(belongs), shall he give it" אשׁמתו בּיום: in the day when he makes
atonement for his trespass, i.e., offers his trespass-offering. The
trespass (guilt) against Jehovah was to be taken away by the
trespass-offering according to the valuation of the priest, as in [Lev
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015.md), [Lev
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016.md), and [Lev
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#018.md), that he might receive expiation
and forgiveness on account of what he had done.

If now, in order to obtain a clear view of the much canvassed difference
between the sin-offerings and trespass-offerings,

(Note: For the different views, see Bhr's Symbolik; Winer's bibl. R. W.;
Kurtz on Sacrificial Worship; Riehm, theol. Stud. und Krit. 1854, pp.
93ff.; Rinck, id. 1855, p. 369; Oehler in Herzog's Cycl.)

we look at once at the other cases, for which trespass-offerings were
commanded in the law; we find in [Num
5:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#005.md) not only a trespass against
Jehovah, but an unjust withdrawal of the property of a neighbour,
clearly mentioned as a crime, for which material compensation was to be
made with the addition of a fifth of its value, just as in [Lev
5:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#002.md) of the present chapter. So also
the guilt of a man who had lain with the slave of another ([Lev
19:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#020).md) did not come into the
ordinary category of adultery, but into that of an unjust invasion of
the domain of another's property; though in this case, as the crime
could not be estimated in money, instead of material compensation being
made, a civil punishment (viz., bodily scourging) was to be inflicted;
and for the same reason nothing is said about the valuation of the
sacrificial ram. Lastly, in the trespass-offerings for the cleansing of
a leper ([Lev 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#012)..md), or of a
Nazarite who had been defiled by a corpse ([Num
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#012).md), it is true we cannot show in
what definite way the rights of Jehovah were violated (see the
explanation of these passages), but the sacrifices themselves served to
procure the restoration of the persons in question to certain covenant
rights which they had lost; so that even here the trespass-offering, for
which moreover only a male sheep was demanded, was to be regarded as a
compensation or equivalent for the rights to be restored. From all these
cases it is perfectly evident, that the idea of satisfaction for a
right, which had been violated but was about to be restored or
recovered, lay at the foundation of the trespass-offering,

(Note: Even in the case of the trespass-offering, which those who had
taken heathen wives offered at Ezra's instigation ([Ezr
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#018)..md), it had reference to a
trespass (cf. vv. 2 and 10), an act of unfaithfulness to Jehovah, which
demanded satisfaction. And so again the Philistines ([Sa1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#003)..md), when presenting gifts as a
trespass-offering for Jehovah, rendered satisfaction for the robbery
committed upon Him by the removal of the ark of the covenant.)

and the ritual also points to this. The animal sacrificed was always a
ram, except in the cases mentioned in [Lev
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#012.md). and [Num
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#012.md). This fact alone clearly
distinguishes the trespass-offerings from the sin-offerings, for which
all kinds of sacrifices were offered from an ox to a pigeon, the choice
of the animal being regulated by the position of the sinner and the
magnitude of his sin. But they are distinguished still more by the fact,
that in the case of all the sin-offerings the blood was to be put upon
the horns of the altar, or even taken into the sanctuary itself, whereas
the blood of the trespass-offerings, like that of the burnt and
peace-offerings, was merely swung against the wall of the altar ([Lev
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#002).md). Lastly, they were also
distinguished by the fact, that in the trespass-offering the ram was in
most instances to be valued by the priest, not for the purpose of
determining its actual value, which could not vary very materially in
rams of the same kind, but to fix upon it symbolically the value of the
trespass for which compensation was required. Hence there can be no
doubt, that as the idea of the expiation of sin, which was embodied in
the sprinkling of the blood, was most prominent in the sin-offering; so
the idea of satisfaction for the restoration of rights that had been
violated or disturbed came into the foreground in the trespass-offering.
This satisfaction was to be actually made, wherever the guilt admitted
of a material valuation, by means of payment or penance; and in addition
to this, the animal was raised by the priestly valuation into the
authorized bearer of the satisfaction to be rendered to the rights of
God, through the sacrifice of which the culprit could obtain the
expiation of his guilt.
