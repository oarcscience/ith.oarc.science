### [Job Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#001)

[Job 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 15:1</span></span>

1 Then began Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:

2 Doth a wise man utter vain knowledge,

And fill his breast with the east wind?

3 Contending with words, that profit not,

And speeches, by which no good is done?

4 Moreover, thou makest void the fear of God,

And thou restrainest devotion before God;

5 For thy mouth exposeth thy misdeeds,

And thou choosest the language of the crafty.

6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee and not I,

And thine own lips testify against thee.

The second course of the controversy is again opened by Eliphaz, the
most respectable, most influential, and perhaps oldest of the friends.
Job's detailed and bitter answers seem to him as empty words and
impassioned tirades, which ill become a wise man, such as he claims to
be in assertions like [Job 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003); [Job
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#002). החלם with He interr., like העלה,
[Job 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025). רוּח, wind, is the
opposite of what is solid and sure; and קדים in the parallel (like [Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002)) signifies what is worthless,
with the additional notion of vehement action. If we translate בּטן by
"belly," the meaning is apt to be misunderstood; it is not intended as
the opposite of לב fo et (Ewald), but it means, especially in the book
of Job, not only that which feels, but also thinks and wills, the
spiritually receptive and active inner nature of man (Psychol. S. 266);
as also in Arabic, el-battin signifies that which is within, in the
deepest mystical sense. Hirz. and Renan translate the inf. abs. הוכח,
which follows in [Job 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#003), as verb.
fin.: se dfend-il par des vaines paroles; but though the inf. abs. is so
used in an historical clause ([Job
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035)), it is not an interrogative.
Ewald takes it as the subject: "to reprove with words-avails not, and
speeches - whereby one does no good;" but though דּבר and מלּים might be
used without any further defining, as in λογομαχεῖν ([Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014)) and λογομαχία ([Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004)), the form of [Job
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#003) is opposed to such an
explanation. The inf. abs. is connected as a gerund (redarguendo s.
disputando) with the verbs in the question, [Job
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#002); and the elliptical relative
clause יסכּן לא is best, as referring to things, according to [Job
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#003) : sermone (דּבד from דּבר, as
sermo from serere) qui non prodest; בּם יועיל לא, on the other hand, to
persons, verbis quibus nil utilitatis affert. Eliphaz does not censure
Job for arguing, but for defending himself by such useless and
purposeless utterances of his feeling. But still more than that: his
speeches are not only unsatisfactory and unbecoming, אף, accedit quod
(cumulative like [Job 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#003)), they are
moreover irreligious, since by doubting the justice of God they deprive
religion of its fundamental assumption, and diminish the reverence due
to God. יראה in such an objective sense as [Psa
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010) almost corresponds to the idea
of religion. שׂיחה לפני־אל is to be understood, according to [Psa
102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001); [Psa
142:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#003) (comp. [Psa
64:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#002); [Psa
104:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#034)): before God, and consequently
customary devotional meditation, here of the disposition of mind
indispensable to prayer, viz., devotion, and especially reverential awe,
which Job depreciates (גּרע, detrahere). His speeches are mostly
directed towards God; but they are violent and reproachful, therefore
irreverent in form and substance.

[Job 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#005)

כּי is not affirmative: forsooth (Hirz.), but, confirmatory and
explicative. This opinion respecting him, which is so sharply and
definitely expressed by אתּה, thrusts itself irresistibly forward, for
it is not necessary to know his life more exactly, his own mouth, whence
such words escape, reveals his sad state: docet (אלּף only in the book
of Job, from אלף, discere, a word which only occurs once in the Hebrew,
[Pro 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#025)) culpam tuam os tuum, not
as Schlottm. explains, with Raschi: docet culpa tua os tuum, which, to
avoid being misunderstood, must have been חטאתך תאלף, and is a though
unsuited to the connection. אלּף is certainly not directly equivalent to
הגּיד, [Isa 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009); it signifies to
teach, to explain, and this verb is just the one in the mouth of the
censorious friend. What follows must not be translated: while thou
choosest (Hirz.); ותבחר is not a circumstantial clause, but adds a
second confirmatory clause to the first: he chooses the language of the
crafty, since he pretends to be able to prove his innocence before God;
and convinced that he is in the right, assumes the offensive (as [Job
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004).) against those who exhort him to
humble himself. Thus by his evil words he becomes his own judge
(ירשׁיעך) and accuser (יענו בך after the fem. שׂפתיך, like [Pro
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002); [Pro
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#023)). The knot of the controversy
becomes constantly more entangled since Job strengthens the friends more
and more in their false view by his speeches, which certainly are sinful
in some parts (as [Job 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022)).

[Job 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 15:7</span></span>

7 Wast thou as the first one born as a man,

And hast thou been brought forth before the hills?

8 Hast thou attended to the counsel of Eloah,

And hast thou kept wisdom to thyself?

9 What dost thou know that we have not known?

Doest thou understand what we have not been acquainted with?

10 Both grey-haired and aged are among us,

Older in days than thy father.

The question in [Job 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007) assumes that
the first created man, because coming direct from the hand of God, had
the most direct and profoundest insight into the mysteries of the world
which came into existence at the same time as himself. Schlottman calls
to mind an ironical proverbial expression of the Hindus: "Yea, indeed,
he is the first man; no wonder that he is so wise" (Roberts, Orient.
Illustr. p. 276). It is not to be translated: wast thou born as the
first man, which is as inadmissible as the translation of אחת מעט, [Hag
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006), by "a little" (vid., Khler in
loc.); rather ראישׁון (i.e., ראישׁון, as [Jos
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#010), formed from ראשׁ, like the
Arabic raı̂s, from ras, if it is not perhaps a mere incorrect
amalgamation of the forms ראשׁון and רשׁון, [Job
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008)) is in apposition with the
subject, and אדם is to be regarded as predicate, according to Ges. 139,
2. Raschi's translation is also impossible: wast thou born before Adam?
for this Greek form of expression, πρῶτος μον, [Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015), [Joh
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#030); [Joh
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018) (comp. Odyss. xi. 481f., σεῖο
μακάρτατος), is strange to the Hebrew. In the parallel question, [Job
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007), Umbr., Schlottm., and Renan
(following Ewald) see a play upon [Pro
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#024).: art thou the demiurgic Wisdom
itself? But the introductory proverbs (Prov 1-9) are more recent than
the book of Job (vid., supra, p. 24), and indeed probably, as we shall
show elsewhere, belong to the time of Jehoshaphat. Consequently the more
probable relation is that the writer of [Pro
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#024). has adopted words from the book
of Job in describing the pre-existence of the Chokma. Was Job, a higher
spirit-nature, brought forth, i.e., as it were amidst the pangs of
travail (חוללת, Pulal from חול, חיל), before the hills? for the angels,
according to Scripture, were created before man, and even before the
visible universe (vid., [Job 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004).).
Hirz., Ew., Schlottm., and others erroneously translate the futt. in the
questions, [Job 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008), as praes. All
the verbs in [Job 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007), [Job
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008), are under the control of the
retrospective character which is given to the verses by ראישׁון; comp.
[Job 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#010)., where זכר־נא has the same
influence, and also [Job 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003), where
the historical sense of אוּלד depends not upon the syntax, but upon
logical necessity. Translate therefore: didst thou attend in the secret
council (סוד, like [Jer 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#018), comp.
[Psa 89:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#008)) of Eloah (according to the
correct form of writing in Codd. and in Kimchi, Michlol 54a, הבסוד, like
[Job 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#011) המעט and [Job
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#013) הבעד, with Beth raph. and
without Gaja),

(Note: As a rule, the interrogative He, when pointed with Pathach, has
Gaja against the Pathach [Sa2 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#005);
this, however, falls away (among other instances) when the syllable
immediately following the He has the tone, as in the two examples given
above (comp. also האל, [Job 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003); הלאל,
[Job 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007)), or the usual Gaja (Metheg)
which stands in the antepenultima (Br, Metheg-Setzung, 23)

and didst then acquire for thyself (גרע, here attrahere, like the
Arabic, sorbere, to suck in) wisdom? by which one is reminded of
Prometheus' fire stolen from heaven. Nay, Job can boast of no
extraordinary wisdom. The friends - as Eliphaz, [Job
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#009), says in their name - are his
contemporaries; and if he desires to appeal to the teaching of his
father, and of his ancestors generally, let them know that there are
hoary-headed men among themselves, whose discernment is deeper by reason
of their more advanced age. גּם is inverted, like [Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010) (which see); and at the same
time, since it is sued twice, it is correlative: etiam inter nos et cani
et senes. Most modern expositors think that Eliphaz, "in modestly
concealed language" (Ewald), refers to himself. But the reference would
be obvious enough; and wherefore this modest concealing, which is so
little suited to the character of Eliphaz? Moreover, [Job
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010) does not sound as if speaking
merely of one, and in [Job 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010)
Eliphaz would make himself older than he appears to be, for it is
nowhere implied that Job is a young man in comparison with him. We
therefore with Umbreit explain בּנוּ: in our generation. Thus it sounds
more like the Arabic, both in words (kebı̂r Arab., usual in the signif.
grandaevus) and in substance. Eliphaz appeals to the source of reliable
tradition, since they have even among their races and districts mature
old men, and since, indeed, according to Job's own admission ([Job
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012)), there is "wisdom among the
ancient ones."

[Job 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 15:11</span></span>

11 Are the consolations of God too small for thee,

And a word thus tenderly spoken with thee?

12 What overpowers thy hearts?

And why do thine eyes wink,

13 That thou turnest thy snorting against God,

And sendest forth such words from thy mouth?

By the consolations of God, Eliphaz means the promises in accordance
with the majesty and will of God, by which he and the other friends have
sought to cheer him, of course presupposing a humble resignation to the
just hand of God. By "a word (spoken) in gentleness to him," he means
the gentle tone which they have maintained, while he has passionately
opposed them. לאט, elsewhere לאט (e.g., [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006), of the softly murmuring and
gently flowing Siloah), from אט (declined, אטּי), with the neutral,
adverbial ל (as לבטה), signifies: with a soft step, gently, The word has
no connection with לוּט, לאט, to cover over, and is not third praet. (as
it is regarded by Raschi, after Chajug): which he has gently said to
you, or that which has gently befallen you; in which, as in Frst's
Handwrterbuch, the notions secrete ([Jdg
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#021), Targ. בּרז, in secret) and
leniter are referred to one root. Are these divine consolations, and
these so gentle addresses, too small for thee (מעט ממך, opp. [Kg1
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#007)), i.e., beneath thy dignity, and
unworthy of they notice? What takes away (לקה, auferre, abripere, as
frequently) thy heart (here of wounded pride), and why do thine eyes
gleam, that thou turnest (השׁיב, not revertere, but vertere, as freq.)
thy ill-humour towards God, and utterest מלּין (so here, not מלּים)
words, which, because they are without meaning and intelligence, are
nothing but words? רזם, ἅπ. γεγρ., is transposed from רמז, to wink,
i.e., to make known by gestures and grimaces, - a word which does not
occur in biblical, but is very common in post-biblical, Hebrew (e.g.,
חרשׁ רומז ונרמז, a deaf and dumb person expresses himself and is
answered by a language of signs). Modern expositors arbitrarily
understand a rolling of the eyes; it is more natural to think of the
vibration of the eye-lashes or eye-brows. רוּח, [Job
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#013), is as in [Jdg
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#003); [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004), comp. [Job
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#011), and freq. used of passionate
excitement, which is thus expressed because it manifests itself in
πνέειν ([Act 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)), and has its rise in
the πνεῦμα ([Ecc 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#009)). Job ought to
control this angry spirit, θυμός (Psychol. S. 198); but he allows it to
burst forth, and makes even God the object on which he vents his anger
in impetuous language. How much better it would be for him, if he would
search within himself ([Lam 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039)) for
the reason of those sufferings which so deprive him of his self-control!

[Job 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 15:14</span></span>

14 What is mortal man that he should be pure,

And that he who is born of woman should be righteous?

15 He trusteth not His holy ones,

And the heavens are not pure in His eyes:

16 How much less the abominable and corrupt,

Man, who drinketh iniquity as water!

The exclamation in [Job 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014) is like
the utterance: mortal man and man born flesh of flesh cannot be entirely
sinless. Even "the holy ones" and "the heavens" are not. The former are,
as in [Job 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001), according to [Job
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018), the angels as beings of light
(whether קדשׁ signifies to be light from the very first, spotlessly
pure, or, vid., Psalter, i. 588f., to be separated, distinct, and hence
exalted above what is common); the latter is not another expression for
the אנגּלי מרומא (Targ.), the "angels of the heights," but שׁמים is the
word used for the highest spheres in which they dwell (comp. [Job
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005)); for the angels are certainly
not corporeal, but, like all created things, in space, and the
Scriptures everywhere speak of angels and the starry heavens together.
Hence the angels are called the morning stars in [Job
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007), and hence both stars and angels
are called צבא השׁמים and צבאות (vid., Genesis. S. 128). Even the angels
and the heavens are finite, and consequently are not of a nature
absolutely raised above the possibility of sin and contamination.

Eliphaz repeats here what he has already said, [Job
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018).; but he does it intentionally,
since he wishes still more terribly to describe human uncleanness to Job
(Oetinger). In that passage אף was merely the sign of an anti-climax,
here כּי אף is quanto minus. Eliphaz refers to the hereditary infirmity
and sin of human nature in [Job 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014),
here ([Job 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016)) to man's own free
choice of that which works his destruction. He uses the strongest
imaginable words to describe one actualiter and originaliter corrupted.
נתעב denotes one who is become an abomination, or the abominated =
abominable (Ges. 134, 1); נאלח, one thoroughly corrupted (Arabic alacha,
in the medial VIII conjugation: to become sour, which reminds one of
ζύμη, Rabb. שׂאר שׁבּעסּה, as an image of evil, and especially of evil
desire). It is further said of him (an expression which Elihu adopts,
[Job 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007)), that he drinks up evil
like water. The figure is like [Pro
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#006), comp. on [Psa
73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010), and implies that he lusts after
sin, and that it is become a necessity of his nature, and is to his
nature what water is to the thirsty. Even Job does not deny this
corruption of man ([Job 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004)), but the
inferences which the friends draw in reference to him he cannot
acknowledge. The continuation of Eliphaz' speech shows how they render
this acknowledgment impossible to him.

[Job 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 15:17</span></span>

17 I will inform thee, hear me!

And what I have myself seen that I will declare,

18 Things which wise men declare

Without concealment from their fathers -

19 To them alone was the land given over,

And no stranger had passed in their midst - :

Eliphaz, as in his first speech, introduces the dogma with which he
confronts Job with a solemn preface: in the former case it had its rise
in a revelation, here it is supported by his own experience and reliable
tradition; for חזיתי is not intended as meaning ecstatic vision
(Schlottm.). The poet uses חזה also of sensuous vision, [Job
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#017); and of observation and knowledge
by means of the senses, not only the more exalted, as [Job
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#026)., but of any kind ([Job
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009); [Job
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001); [Job
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#012), comp. [Job
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#025); [Job
34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032)), in the widest sense. זה is
used as neuter, [Gen 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#015); [Exo
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#008); [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013); [Lev
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#004), and freq.

(Note: So also [Psa 56:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#010), where I now
prefer to translate "This I know," זה neuter, like [Pro
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012), and referring forward as above,
[Job 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#017).)

(comp. the neuter הוּא, [Job 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#016),
and often), and זה־חזיתי is a relative clause (Ges. 122, 2): quod
conspexi, as [Job 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#019) quos amo, and
[Psa 74:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002) in quo habitas, comp. [Psa
104:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#008), [Psa
104:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026); [Pro
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#022), where the punctuation
throughout proceeds from the correct knowledge of the syntax. The waw of
ואספרה is the waw apodosis, which is customary (Ngelsbach, 111, 1, b)
after relative clauses (e.g., [Num
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003)), or what is the same thing,
participles (e.g., [Pro 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#024)): et
narrabo = ea narrabo. In [Job 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#018)
ולא כחדו is, logically at least, subordinate to יגידו, as in [Isa
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009),

(Note: Heidenheim refers to [Hos 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#002)
for the position of the words, but there Israel may also be an
apposition: we know thee, we Israel.)

as the Targum of the Antwerp Polyglott well translates: "what wise men
declare, without concealing (ולא מכדבין), from the tradition of their
fathers;" whereas all the other old translations, including Luther's,
have missed the right meaning. These fathers to whom this doctrine
respecting the fate of evil-doers is referred, lived, as Eliphaz says in
[Job 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#019), in the land of their
birth, and did not mingle themselves with strangers, consequently their
manner of viewing things, and their opinions, have in their favour the
advantage of independence, of being derived from their own experience,
and also of a healthy development undisturbed by any foreign influences,
and their teaching may be accounted pure and unalloyed.

Eliphaz thus indirectly says, that the present is not free from such
influences, and Ewald is consequently of opinion that the individuality
of the Israelitish poet peeps out here, and a state of things is
indicated like that which came about after the fall of Samaria in the
reign of Manasseh. Hirzel also infers from Eliphaz' words, that at the
time when the book was written the poet's fatherland was desecrated by
some foreign rule, and considers it an indication for determining the
time at which the book was composed. But how groundless and deceptive
this is! The way in which Eliphaz commends ancient traditional lore is
so genuinely Arabian, that there is but the faintest semblance of a
reason for supposing the poet to have thrown his own history and
national peculiarity so vividly into the working up of the rôle of
another. Purity of race was, from the earliest times, considered by "the
sons of the East" as a sign of highest nobility, and hence Eliphaz
traces back his teaching to a time when his race could boast of the
greatest freedom from intermixture with any other. Schlottmann prefers
to interpret [Job 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#019) as referring
to the "nobler primeval races of man" (without, however, referring to
[Job 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008)), but הארץ does not signify
the earth here, but: country, as in [Job
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008); [Job
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#008), and elsewhere, and [Job
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#019) seems to refer to nations: זר =
barbarus (perhaps Semitic: בּרבּר, ὁ ἔξω). Nevertheless it is
unnecessary to suppose that Eliphaz' time was one of foreign domination,
as the Assyrian-Chaldean time was for Israel: it is sufficient to
imagine it as a time when the tribes of the desert were becoming
intermixed, from migration, commerce, and feud.

Now follows the doctrine of the wise men, which springs from a venerable
primitive age, an age as yet undisturbed by any strange way of thinking
(modern enlightenment and free thinking, as we should say), and is
supported by Eliphaz' own experience.

(Note: Communication from Consul Wetzstein: If this verse affirms that
the freer a people is from intermixture with other races, the purer is
its tradition, it gives expression to a principle derived from
experience, which needs no proof. Even European races, especially the
Scandinavians, furnish proof of this in their customs, language, and
traditions, although in this case certain elements of their indigenous
character have vanished with the introduction of Christianity. A more
complete parallel is furnished by the wandering tribes of the 'Aneze and
Sharrt of the Syrian deserts, people who have indeed had their
struggles, and have even been weakened by emigration, but have certainly
never lost their political and religious autonomy, and have preserved
valuable traditions which may be traced to the earliest antiquity. It is
unnecessary to prove this by special instance, when the whole outer and
inner life of these peoples can be regarded as the best commentary on
the biblical accounts of the patriarchal age. It is, however, not so
much the fact that the evil-doer receives his punishment, in favour of
which Eliphaz appeals to the teaching handed down from the fathers, as
rather the belief in it, consequently in a certain degree the dogma of a
moral order in the world. This dogma is an essential element of the
ancient Abrahamic religion of the desert tribes - that primitive
religion which formed the basis of the Mosaic, and side by side with it
was continued among the nomads of the desert; which, shortly before the
appearance of Christianity in the country east of Jordan, gave birth to
mild doctrines, doctrines which tended to prepare the way for the
teaching of the gospel; which at that very time, according to historical
testimony, also prevailed in the towns of the Higz, and was first
displaced again by the Jemanic idolatry, and limited to the desert, in
the second century after Christ, during the repeated migrations of the
southern Arabs; which gave the most powerful impulse to the rise of
Islam, and furnished its best elements; which, towards the end of the
last century, brought about the reform of Islamism in the province of
Negd, and produced the Wahabee doctrine; and which, finally, is
continued even to the present day by the name of Dn Ibrhm, "Religion of
Abraham," as a faithful tradition of the fathers, among the vast
Ishmaelitish tribes of the Syrian desert, "to whom alone the land is
given over, and into whose midst no stranger has penetrated." Had this
cultus spread among settled races with a higher education, it might have
been taught also in writings: if, however, portions of writings in
reference to it, which have been handed down to us by the Arabic, are to
be regarded as unauthentic, it may also in 'Irk have been mixed with the
Sabian worship of the stars; but among the nomads it will have always
been only oral, taught by the poets in song, and contained in the fine
traditions handed down uncorrupted from father to son, and practised in
life.

It is a dogma of this religion (of which I shall speak more fully in the
introduction to my Anthologie von Poesien der Wanderstmme), that the
pious will be rewarded by God in his life and in his descendants, the
wicked punished in his life and in his descendants; and it may also, in
[Job 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#019), be indirectly said that
the land of Eliphaz has preserved this faith, in accordance with
tradition, purer than Job's land. If Eliphaz was from the Petraean town
of Tmn (which we merely suggest as possible here), he might indeed
rightly assert that no strange race had become naturalized there; for
that hot, sterile land, poorly supplied with water, had nothing inviting
to the emigrant or marauder, and its natives remain there only by virtue
of the proverb: lôlâ hhibb el-wattan quat.tâl, lakân dâr eṡsû' charâb,
"Did not the love of one's country slay (him who is separated from it),
the barren country would be uninhabited." Job certainly could not affirm
the same of his native country, if this is, with the Syrian tradition,
to be regarded as the Nukra (on this point, vid., the Appendix). As the
richest province of Syria, it has, from the earliest time to the
present, always been an apple of contention, and has not only frequently
changed its rulers, but even its inhabitants.)

[Job 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 15:20</span></span>

20 So long as the ungodly liveth he suffereth,

And numbered years are reserved for the tyrant.

21 Terrors sound in his ears;

In time of peace the destroyer cometh upon him.

22 He believeth not in a return from darkness,

And he is selected for the sword.

23 He roameth about after bread: "Ah! where is it?"

He knoweth that a dark day is near at hand for him.

24 Trouble and anguish terrify him;

They seize him as a king ready to the battle.

All the days of the ungodly he (the ungodly) is sensible of pain. רשׁע
stands, like Elohim in [Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006), by
the closer definition; here however so, that this defining ends after
the manner of a premiss, and is begun by הוּא after the manner of a
conclusion. מתחולל, he writhes, i.e., suffers inward anxiety and
distress in the midst of all outward appearance of happiness. Most
expositors translate the next line: and throughout the number of the
years, which are reserved to the tyrant. But (1) this parallel
definition of time appended by waw makes the sense drawling; (2) the
change of עריץ (oppressor, tyrant) for רשׁע leads one to expect a fresh
affirmation, hence it is translated by the lxx: ἔτη δὲ ἀριθμητὰ δεδομένα
δυνάστῃ. The predicate is, then, like [Job
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#007), comp. [Job
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#010); [Job
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004) (Ges. 148), per attractionem in
the plur. instead of in the sing., and especially with מספּר followed by
gen. plur.; this attraction is adopted by our author, [Job
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#021); [Job
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#021). The meaning is not, that
numbered, i.e., few, years are secretly appointed to the tyrant, which
must have been sh'nôth mispâr, a reversed position of the words, as [Job
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#022); [Num
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#020) (vid., Gesenius' Thes.); but a
(limited, appointed) number of years is reserved to the tyrant (צפן as
[Job 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001); [Job
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019), comp. טמן, [Job
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026); Mercerus: occulto decreto
definiti), after the expiration of which his punishment begins. The
thought expressed by the Targ., Syr., and Jerome would be suitable: and
the number of the years (that he has to live unpunished) is hidden from
the tyrant; but if this were the poet's meaning, he would have written
שׁניו, and must have written מן־העריץ.

With regard to the following [Job
15:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#021), it is doubtful whether only
the evil-doer's anxiety of spirit is described in amplification of הוא
מתחולל, or also how the terrible images from which he suffers in his
conscience are realized, and how he at length helplessly succumbs to the
destruction which his imagination had long foreboded. A satisfactory and
decisive answer to this question is hardly possible; but considering
that the real crisis is brought on by Eliphaz later, and fully
described, it seems more probable that what has an objective tone in
[Job 15:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#021) is controlled by what
has been affirmed respecting the evil conscience of the ungodly, and is
to be understood accordingly. The sound of terrible things (startling
dangers) rings in his ears; the devastator comes upon him (בוא seq. acc.
as [Job 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#022); [Pro
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#022); comp. [Isa
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015)) in the midst of his prosperity.
He anticipates it ere it happens. From the darkness by which he feels
himself menaced, he believes not (האמין seq. infin. as [Psa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013), לראות, of confident hope) to
return; i.e., overwhelmed with a consciousness of his guilt, he cannot,
in the presence of this darkness which threatens him, raise to the hope
of rescue from it, and he is really - as his consciousness tells him -
צפוּ (like עשׂוּ, [Job 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#025); Ges. 75,
rem. 5; Keri צפוי, which is omitted in our printed copies, contrary to
the testimony of the Masora and the authority of correct MSS), spied out
for, appointed to the sword, i.e., of God ([Job
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#029); [Isa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008)), or decreed by God. In the midst
of abundance he is harassed by the thought of becoming poor; he wanders
about in search of bread, anxiously looking out and asking where?
(abrupt, like הנה, [Job 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019)), i.e.,
where is any to be found, whence can I obtain it? The lxx translates
contrary to the connection, and with a strange misunderstanding of the
passage: κατατέτακται δὲ δἰς σῖτα γυψίν (איּה לחם, food for the
vulture). He sees himself in the mirror of the future thus reduced to
beggary; he knows that a day of darkness stands in readiness (נכון, like
[Job 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#012)), is at his hand, i.e.,
close upon him (בּידו, elsewhere in this sense ליד, [Psa
140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006); [Sa1
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#003), and על־ידי, [Job
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#014)).

In accordance with the previous exposition, we shall now interpret
וּמצוּקה צר, [Job 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#024), not of need
and distress, but subjectively of fear and oppression. They come upon
him suddenly and irresistibly; it seizes or overpowers him (תּתקפהוּ
with neutral subject; an unknown something, a dismal power) as a king
עתיד לכּידור. lxx ὥσπερ στρατηγὸς πρωτοστάτης πίπτων, like a leader
falling in the first line of the battle, which is an imaginary
interpretation of the text. The translation of the Targum also, sicut
regem qui paratus est ad scabellum (to serve the conqueror as a
footstool), furnishes no explanation. Another Targum translation (in
Nachmani and elsewhere) is: sicut rex qui paratus est circumdare se
legionibus. According to this, כידור comes from כּדר, to surround, be
round (comp. כּתר, whence כּתר, Assyr. cudar, κίδαρις, perhaps also הזר,
Syr. חדר, whence chedor, a circle, round about); and it is assumed, that
as כּדּוּר signifies a ball (not only in Talmudic, but also in [Isa
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018), which is to be translated:
rolling he rolleth thee into a ball, a ball in a spacious land), so
כּידור, a round encampment, an army encamped in a circle, synon. of
מעגּל. In the first signification the word certainly furnishes no
suitable sense in connection with עתיד; but one may, with Kimchi,
suppose that כידור, like the Italian torniamento, denotes the circle as
well as the tournament, or the round of conflict, i.e., the conflict
which moves round about, like tumult of battle, which last is a suitable
meaning here. The same appropriate meaning is attained, however, if the
root is taken, like the Arabic kdr, in the signification turbidum esse
(comp. קדר, [Job 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#016)), which is
adopted of misfortunes as troubled experiences of life (according to
which Schultens translates: destinatus est ad turbulentissimas fortunas,
beginning a new thought with עתיד, which is not possible, since כמלך by
itself is no complete figure), and may perhaps also be referred to the
tumult of battle, tumultus bellici conturbatio (Rosenm.); or of, with
Fleischer, one starts from another turn of the idea of the root, viz.,
to be compressed, solid, thick, which is a more certain way gives the
meaning of a dense crowd.

(Note: The Arab. verb kdr belongs to the root kd, to smite, thrust,
quatere, percutere, tundere, trudere; a root that has many branches. It
is I. transitive cadara (fut. jacduru, inf. cadr) - by the non-adoption
of which from the original lexicons our lexicographers have deprived the
whole etymological development of its groundwork - in the signification
to pour, hurl down, pour out, e.g., cadara-l-ma, he has spilt, poured
out, thrown down the water; hence in the medial VII. form incadara
intransitive, to fall, fall down, chiefly of water and other fluids, as
of the rain which pours down from heaven, of a cascade, and the like;
then improperly of a bird of prey which shoots down from the air upon
its prey (e.g., in the poetry in Beidhwi on Sur. 81, 2: "The hawk saw
some bustards on the plain f'ancadara, and rushed down"); of a hostile
host which rushes upon the enemy first possible signification for
כידור\]; of a man, horse, etc., which runs very swiftly, effuse currit,
effuso curru ruit; of the stars that shall fall from heaven at the last
day (Sur. 81, 2). Then also II. intransitive cadara (fut. jacdiru) with
the secondary form cadira (fut. jacdaru) and cadura (fut. jacduru),
prop. to be shaken and jolted; then also of fluid things, mixed and
mingled, made turgid, unclean, i.e., by shaking, jolting, stirring,
etc., with the dregs (the cudre or cudde); then gen. turbidum, non
limpidum (opp. Arab. ṣf'), with a similar transition of meaning to that
in turbare (comp. deturbare) and the German trben (comp. traben or
trappen, treiben, treffen). The primary meaning of the root takes
another III. turn in the derived adjectives cudur, cudurr, cundur,
cundir, compressed, solid, thick; the last word with us (Germans) forms
a transition from cadir, cadr, cadr, dull, slimy, yeasty, etc., inasmuch
as we speak of dickes Bier (thick beer), etc., cerevisia spissa, de la
bire paisse. Here the point of contact of the word כידור, tumult of
battle, κλόνος ἀνδρῶν, seems indicated: a dense crowd and tumult, where
one is close upon another; as also נלחם, מלחמה, signify not reciprocal
destruction, slaughter, but to press firmly and closely upon one
another, a dense crowd. - Fl.)

Since, therefore, a suitable meaning is obtained in two ways, the
natural conjecture, which is commended by [Pro
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011), עתיד לכּידון, paratus ad hastam
= peritus hastae (Hupf.), according to [Job
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008)) where ערר = לערר), may be
abandoned. The signification circuitus has the most support, according
to which Saadia and Parchon also explain, and we have preferred to
translate round of battle rather than tumult of conflict; Jerome's
translation, qui praeparatur ad praelium, seems also to be gained in the
same manner.

[Job 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 15:25</span></span>

25 Because he stretched out his hand against God,

And was insolent towards the Almighty;

26 He assailed Him with a stiff neck,

With the thick bosses of his shield;

27 Because he covered his face with his fatness,

And addeth fat to his loins,

28 And inhabited desolated cities,

Houses which should not be inhabited,

Which were appointed to be ruins.

29 He shall not be rich, and his substance shall not continue

And their substance boweth not to the ground.

30 He escapeth not darkness;

The flame withereth his shoots;

And he perisheth in the breath of His mouth.

This strophe has periodic members: [Job
15:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#025) an antecedent clause with a
double beginning (כּי־נטה because he has stretched out, כּי־כסּה because
he has covered; whereas ירוּץ may be taken as more independent, but
under the government of the כי that stands at the commencement of the
sentence); [Job 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#029), [Job
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030), is the conclusion. Two chief
sins are mentioned as the cause of the final destiny that comes upon the
evil-doer: (1) his arrogant opposition to God, and (2) his contentment
on the ruins of another's prosperity. The first of these sins is
described [Job 15:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#025). The fut.
consec. is once used instead of the perf., and the simple fut. is twice
used with the signification of an imperf. (as [Job
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#003) and freq.). The Hithpa. התגּבּר
signifies here to maintain a heroic bearing, to play the hero; התעשּׁר
to make one's self rich, to play the part of a rich man, [Pro
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#007). And בּצוּאר expresses the
special prominence of the neck in his assailing God אל רוּץ, as [Dan
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#006), comp. על, [Job
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#014)); it is equivalent to erecto
collo (Vulg.), and in meaning equivalent to ὕβρει (lxx). Also in [Psa
75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006), בצואר (with Munach, which there
represents a distinctive)

(Note: Vid., Dachselt's Biblia Accentuata, p. 816.))

is absolute, in the sense of stiff-necked or hard-headed; for the
parallels, as [Psa 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019); [Psa
94:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#004), and especially the primary
passage, [Sa1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003), show that עתק is to
be taken as an accusative of the object. The proud defiance with which
he challengingly assails God, and renders himself insensible to the
dispensations of God, which might bring him to a right way of thinking,
is symbolized by the additional clause: with the thickness (עבי cognate
form to עבי) of the bosses of his shields. גּב is the back (Arab. dhr)
or boss (umbo) of the shield; the plurality of shields has reference to
the diversified means by which he hardens himself. [Job
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#027), similarly to [Psa
73:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004), pictures this impregnable
carnal security against all unrest and pain, to which, on account of his
own sinfulness and the distress of others, the nobler-minded man is so
sensitive: he has covered his face with his fat, so that by the
accumulation of fat, for which he anxiously labours, it becomes a gross
material lump of flesh, devoid of mind and soul, and made fat, i.e.,
added fat, caused it to accumulate, upon his loins (כּסל for כּסליו);
עשׂה (which has nothing to do with Arab. gšâ, to cover) is used as in
[Job 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#009), and in the phrase corpus
facere (in Justin), in the sense of producing outwardly something from
within. פּימה reminds one of πιμ-ελή (as Aquila and Symmachus translate
here), o-pim-us, and of the Sanscrit piai, to be fat (whence adj. pı̂van,
pı̂vara, πιαρός, part. pı̂na, subst. according to Roth pı̂vas); the Arabic
renders it probable that it is a contraction of פּאימה (Olsh. 171, b).
The Jewish expositors explain it according to the misunderstood פּים,
[Sa1 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#021), of the furrows or wrinkles
which are formed in flabby flesh, as if the ah were paragogic.

[Job 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028) describes the second
capital sin of the evil-doer. The desolated cities that he dwells in are
not cities that he himself has laid waste; [Job
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028) distinctly refers to a divinely
appointed punishment, for התעתּדוּ does not signify: which they
(evil-doers) have made ruins (Hahn), which is neither probable from the
change of number, nor accords with the meaning of the verb, which
signifies "to appoint to something in the future." Hirzel, by referring
to the law, [Deu 13:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#013) (comp. [Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034)), which forbids the rebuilding
of such cities as are laid under the curse, explains it to a certain
extent more correctly. But such a play upon the requirements of the
Mosaic law is in itself not probable in the book of Job, and here, as
Lwenthal rightly remarks, is the less indicated, since it is not the
dwelling in such cities that is forbidden, but only the rebuilding of
them, so far as they had been destroyed; here, however, the reference is
only to dwelling, not to rebuilding. The expression must therefore be
understood more generally thus, that the powerful man settles down
carelessly and indolently, without any fear of the judgments of God or
respect for the manifestations of His judicial authority, in places in
which the marks of a just divine retribution are still visible, and
which are appointed to be perpetual monuments of the execution of divine
judgments.

(Note: For the elucidation of this interpretation of the passage, Consul
Wetzstein has contributed the following: "As one who yields to
inordinate passion is without sympathy cast from human society because
he is called muqtal rabbuh, 'one who is beaten in the conflict against
his God' (since he has sinned against the holy command of chastity), and
as no one ventures to pronounce the name of Satan because God has cursed
him ([Gen 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014)), without adding 'alh
el-la'ne, 'God's curse upon him!' so a man may not presume to inhabit
places which God has appointed to desolation. Such villages and cities,
which, according to tradition, have perished and been frequently
overthrown (maqlbe, muqlbe, munqualibe) by the visitation of divine
judgment, are not uncommon on the borders of the desert. They are
places, it is said, where the primary commandments of the religion of
Abraham (Dn Ibrhim) have been impiously transgressed. Thus the city of
Babylon will never be colonized by a Semitic tribe, because they hold
the belief that it has been destroyed on account of Nimrod's apostasy
from God, and his hostility to His favoured one, Abraham. The tradition
which has even been transferred by the tribes of Arabia Petraea into
Islamism of the desolation of the city of Higr (or Medin Slih) on
account of disobedience to God, prevents any one from dwelling in that
remarkable city, which consists of thousands of dwellings cut in the
rock, some of which are richly ornamented; without looking round, and
muttering prayers, the desert ranger hurries through, even as does the
great procession of pilgrims to Mekka, from fear of incurring the
punishment of God by the slightest delay in the accursed city. The
destruction of Sodom, brought about by the violation of the right of
hospitality ([Gen 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#005), comp. [Job
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#032)), is to be mentioned here, for
this legend certainly belongs originally to the 'Din Ibrhm' rather than
to the Mosaic. At the source of the Rakkd (the largest river of the
Golan region) there are a number of erect and remarkably perforated
jasper formations, which are called 'the bridal procession' (el-frida).
This bridal procession was turned to stone, because a woman of the party
cleaned her child that had made itself dirty with a bread-cake (qurss).
Near it is its village (Ufne), which in spite of repeated attempts is no
more to be inhabited. It remains forsaken, as an eternal witness that
ingratitude (kufrn en-ni'ma), especially towards God, does not remain
unpunished.)

Only by this rendering is the form of expression of the elliptical
clause לא־ישׁבוּ למו explained. Hirz. refers למו to בּתּים: in which
they do not dwell; but ל ישׁב does not signify: to dwell in a place,
but: to settle down in a place; Schlottm. refers למו to the inhabitants:
therein they dwell not themselves, i.e., where no one dwelt; but the
אשׁר which would be required in this case as acc. localis could not be
omitted. One might more readily, with Hahn, explain: those to whom they
belong do not inhabit them; but it is linguistically impossible for למו
to stand alone as the expression of this subject (the possessors). The
most natural, and also an admissible explanation, is, that yshbw refers
to the houses, and that למו, which can be used not only of persons, but
also of things, is dat. ethicus. The meaning, however, is not: which are
uninhabited, which would not be expressed as future, but rather by אין
בהם יושׁב or similarly, but: which shall not inhabit, i.e., shall not be
inhabited to them (ישׁב to dwell = to have inhabitants, as [Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010); [Jer
50:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#013), [Jer
50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039), and freq.), or, as we should
express it, which ought to remain uninhabited.

[Job 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#029) begins the conclusion:
(because he has acted thus) he shall not be rich (with a personal
subject as [Hos 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009), and יעשּׁר to be
written with a sharpened שׁ, like יעצר above, [Job
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#015)), and his substance shall not
endure (קוּם, to take place, [Isa 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#007);
to endure, [Sa1 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014); and hold fast,
[Job 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#018)), and מנלם shall not
incline itself to the earth. The interpretation of the older expositors,
non extendet se in terra, is impossible - that must be בּארץ eb tsum
taht - elbi ינּטה; whereas Kal is commonly used in the intransitive
sense to bow down, bend one's self or incline (Ges. 53, 2). But what is
the meaning of the subject מנלם? We may put out of consideration those
interpretations that condemn themselves: לם מן, ex iis (Targ.), or לם
מן, quod iis, what belongs to them (Saad.), or מלּם, their word (Syr.
and Gecatilia), and such substitutions as σκιάν (צלם or צללם) of the
lxx, and radicem of Jerome (which seems only to be a guess). Certainly
that which throws most light on the signification of the word is כּנּלתך
(for כּהנלתך with Dag. dirimens, as [Job
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002)), which occurs in [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001). The oldest Jewish lexicographers
take this הנלה (parall. התם .ll) as a synonym of כּלּה in the
signification, to bring to an end; on the other hand, Ges., Knobel, and
others, consider כּכלּתך to be the original reading, because the meaning
perficere is not furnished for נלה from the Arab. nâl, and because נל,
standing thus together, is in Arabic an incompatible root combination
(Olsh. 9, 4). This union of consonants certainly does not occur in any
Semitic root, but the Arab. nâla (the long a of which can in the
inflection become a short changeable bowel) furnishes sufficient
protection for this one exception; and the meaning consequi, which
belongs to the Arab. nâla, fut. janı̂lu, is perfectly suited to [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001) : if thou hast fully attained
(Hiph. as intensive of the transitive Kal, like הזעיק, הקנה) to
plundering. If, however, the verb נלה is established, there is no need
for any conjecture in the passage before us, especially since the
improvement nearest at hand, מכלם (Hupf. מגּלה), produces a sentence
(non figet in terra caulam) which could not be flatter and tamer;
whereas the thought that is gained by Olshausen's more sensible
conjecture, מגּלם (their sickle does not sink to the earth, is not
pressed down by the richness of the produce of the field), goes to the
other extreme.

(Note: Carey proposes to take מנלם = נמלם, their cutting, layer for
planting; but the verb-group מלל, מול, נמל (vid., supra, p. 224) is not
favourable to the supposition of a substantive נמל in this
signification, according to the usual application of the language.)

Juda b. Karisch (Kureisch) has explained the word correctly by Arab.
mnâlhm: that which they have offered (from nâla, janûlu) or attained
(nâla, janı̂lu), i.e., their possession

(Note: Freytag has erroneously placed the infinitives nail and manl
under Arab. nl med. Wau, instead of under Arab. nl me. Je, where he only
repeats nail, and erroneously gives manl the signification donum, citing
in support of it a passage from Fkihat al-chulaf, where 'azz al-manl (a
figure borrowed from places difficult of access, and rendered strong and
impregnable by nature or art) signifies "one who was hard to get at"
(i.e., whose position of power is made secure). The true connection is
this: Arab. nl med. Wau signifies originally to extend, reach, to hand
anything to any one with outstretched arm or hand, the correlatum Arab.
nl med. Je: to attain, i.e., first to touch or reach anything with
outstretched arm or hand, and then really to grasp and take it, gen.
adipisci, consequi, assequi, impetrare, with the ordinary infinitives
nail and manl. Therefore manl (from Arab. nl med. Je) signifies
primarily as abstract, attainment; it may then, however, like nail and
the infinitives generally, pass over to the concrete signification: what
one attains to, or what one has attained, gotten, although I can give no
special example in support of it. - Fl.)

(not: their perfection, as it is chiefly explained by the Jewish
expositors, according to נלה = כלה). When the poet says, "their
prosperity inclines not to the ground," he denies to it the likeness to
a field of corn, which from the weight of the ears bows itself towards
the ground, or to a tree, whose richly laden branches bend to the
ground. We may be satisfied with this explanation (Hirz., Ew., Stickel,
and most others): מנלם from מנלה (with which Kimchi compares מכרם, [Num
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#019), which however is derived not
from מכרה, but from מכר), similar in meaning to the post-biblical ממון,
μαμωνᾶς; the suff., according to the same change of number as in [Job
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035); [Job
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023), and freq., refers to רשׁעים.

In [Job 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030), also, a figure taken
from a plant is interwoven with what is said of the person of the
ungodly: the flame withers up his tender branch without its bearing
fruit, and he himself does not escape darkness, but rather perishes by
the breath of His mouth, i.e., God's mouth ([Job
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#009), not of his own, after [Isa
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011)). The repetition of יסוּר ("he
escapes not," as [Pro 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014); "he must
yield to," as [Kg1 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014), and freq.)
is an impressive play upon words.

[Job 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 15:31</span></span>

31 Let him not trust in evil-he is deceived,

For evil shall be his possession.

32 His day is not yet, then it is accomplished,

And his palm-branch loseth its freshness.

33 He teareth off as a vine his young grapes,

And He casteth down as an olive-tree his flower.

34 The company of the hypocrite is rigid,

And fire consumeth the tents of bribery.

35 They conceive sorrow and bring forth iniquity,

And their inward part worketh self-deceit.

אל does not merely introduce a declaration respecting the future
(Luther: he will not continue, which moreover must have been expressed
by the Niph.), but is admonitory: may he only not trust in vanity
(Munach here instead of Dech, according to the rule of transformation,
Psalter, ii. 504, 4) - he falls, so far as he does it, into error, or
brings himself into error (נתעה, 3 praet., not part., and Niph. like
[Isa 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#014), where it signifies to be
thrust backwards and forwards, or to reel about helplessly), - a thought
one might expect after the admonition (Olsh. conjectures נתעב, one who
is detestable): this trusting in evil is self-delusion, for evil becomes
his exchange (תּמוּרה not compensatio, but permutatio, acquisitio). We
have translated שׁוא by "evil" (Unheil), by which we have sought
elsewhere to render און, in order that we might preserve the same word
in both members of the verse. In [Job
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031), שׁוא (in form = שׁוא from שׁוא,
in the Chethib שוּ, the Aleph being cast away, like the Arabic sû',
wickedness, form the v. cavum hamzatum s-'a = sawu'a) is waste and empty
in mind, in [Job 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031) (comp. [Hos
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012)) waste and empty in fortune; or,
to go further from the primary root, in the former case apparent
goodness, in the latter apparent prosperity - delusion, and being
undeceived "evil" in the sense of wickedness, and of calamity. תּמּלא,
which follows, refers to the exchange, or neutrally to the evil that is
exchanged: the one or the other fulfils itself, i.e., either: is
realized (passive of מלּא, [Kg1 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#015)),
or: becomes complete, which means the measure of the punishment of his
immorality becomes full, before his natural day, i.e., the day of death,
is come (comp. for expression, [Job
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#016); [Ecc
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017)). The translation: then it is
over with him (Ges., Schlottm., and others), is contrary to the usage of
the language; and that given by the Jewish expositors, תּמּלא = תּמּלל
(abscinditur or conteritur), is a needlessly bold suggestion. - [Job
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032). It is to be observed that רעננה
is Milel, and consequently 3 praet., not as in [Sol
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#016) Milra, and consequently adj.
כּפּה is not the branches generally (Luzzatto, with Raschi: branchage),
but, as the proverbial expression for the high and low, [Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013); [Isa
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#015) (vid., Dietrich, Abhandlung zur
hebr. Gramm. S. 209), shows, the palm-branch bent downwards (comp. Targ.
[Est 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#005), where כּפּין signifies seats
and walks covered with foliage). "His palm-branch does not become green,
or does not remain green" (which Symm. well renders: οὐκ εὐθαλήσει),
means that as he himself, the palm-trunk, so also his family, withers
away. In [Job 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#033) it is represented
as בּסר (= בּסר), wild grapes, or even unripe grapes of a vine, and as
נצּה, flowers of an olive.

(Note: In order to appreciate the point of the comparison, it is needful
to know that the Syrian olive-tree bears fruit plentifully the first,
third, and fifth years, but rests during the second, fourth, and sixth.
It blossoms in these years also, but the blossoms fall off almost
entirely without any berries being formed. The harvest of the olive is
therefore in such years very scanty. With respect to the vine, every
year an enormous quantity of grapes are used up before they are ripe.
When the berries are only about the size of a pea, the acid from them is
used in housekeeping, to prepare almost every kind of food. The people
are exceedingly fond of things sour, a taste which is caused by the heat
of the climate. During the months of June, July, and August, above six
hundred horses and asses laden with unripe grapes come daily to the
market in Damascus alone, and during this season no one uses vinegar;
hence the word בסרא signifies in Syriac the acid (vinegar) κατ ̓ ἐξοχήν.
In Arabic the unripe grapes are exclusively called hhossrum (Arab.
htsrm), or, with a dialectic distinction, hissrim. - Wetzst.)

In [Job 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032) the godless man himself
might be the subject: he casts down, like an olive-tree, his flowers,
but in [Job 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032) this is
inadmissible; if we interpret: "he shakes off (Targ. יתּר, excutiet),
like a vine-stock, his young grapes," this (apart from the far-fetched
meaning in יחמס) is a figure that is untrue to nature, since the grapes
sit firmer the more unripe they are; and if one takes the first meaning
of חמס, "he acts unjustly, as a vine, to his omphax" (e.g., Hupf.),
whether it means that he does not let it ripen, or that he does not
share with it any of the sweet sap, one has not only an indistinct
figure, but also (since what God ordains for the godless is described as
in operation) an awkward comparison. The subject of both verbs is
therefore other than the vine and olive themselves. But why only an
impersonal "one"? In [Job 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030) רוח
פיו was referred to God, who is not expressly mentioned. God is also the
subject here, and יחמס, which signifies to act with violence to one's
self, is modified here to the sense of tearing away, as [Lam
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006) (which Aben-Ezra has compared), of
tearing out; כגפן, כזית, prop. as a vine-stock, as an olive-tree, is
equivalent to even as such an one.

[Job 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#034) declares the lot of the
family of the ungodly, which has been thus figuratively described,
without figure: the congregation (i.e., here: family-circle) of the
ungodly (חנף according to its etymon inclinans, propensus ad malum,
vid., on [Job 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#016)) is (as it is
expressed from the standpoint of the judgment that is executed) גּלמוּד,
a hard, lifeless, stony mass (in the substantival sense of the Arabic
galmûd instead of the adject. גלמודה, [Isa
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021)), i.e., stark dead (lxx θάνατος;
Aq., Symm., Theod., ἄκαρπος), and fire has devoured the tents of bribery
(after Ralbag: those built by bribery; or even after the lxx: οἴκους
δωροδεκτῶν). The ejaculatory conclusion, [Job
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035), gives the briefest expression
to that which has been already described. The figurative language, [Job
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035), is like [Psa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015); [Isa
59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004) (comp. supra, p. 257); in the
latter passage similar vividly descriptive infinitives are found (Ges.
131, 4, b). They hatch the burdens or sorrow of others, and what comes
from it is evil for themselves. What therefore their בּטן, i.e., their
inward part, with the intermingled feelings, thoughts, and strugglings
(Olympiodorus: κοιλίαν ὅλον τὸ ἐντὸς χωρίον φησὶ καὶ αὐτὴν τῆν ψυχήν),
prepares or accomplishes (יכין similar to [Job
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#017); [Job
38:41](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#041)), that on which it works, is
מרמה, deceit, with which they deceive others, and before all, themselves
(New Test. ἀπάτη).

With the speech of Eliphaz, the eldest among the friends, who gives a
tone to their speeches, the controversy enters upon a second stage. In
his last speech Job has turned from the friends and called upon them to
be silent; he turned to God, and therein a sure confidence, but at the
same time a challenging tone of irreverent defiance, is manifested. God
does not enter into the controversy which Job desires; and the
consequence is, that that flickering confidence is again extinguished,
and the tone of defiance is changed into despair and complaint. Instead
of listening to the voice of God, Job is obliged to content himself
again with that of the friends, for they believe the continuance of the
contest to be just as binding upon them as upon Job. They cannot
consider themselves overcome, for their dogma has grown up in such
inseparable connection with their idea of God, and therefore is so much
raised above human contradiction, that nothing but a divine fact can
break through it. And they are too closely connected with Job by their
friendship to leave him to himself as a heretic; they regard Job as one
who is self-deluded, and have really the good intention of converting
their friend.

Eliphaz' speech, however, also shows that they become still more and
more incapable of producing a salutary impression on Job. For, on the
one hand, in this second stage of the controversy also they turn about
everywhere only in the circle of their old syllogism: suffering is the
punishment of sin, Job suffers, therefore he is a sinner who has to make
atonement for his sin; on the other hand, instead of being disconcerted
by an unconditioned acceptation of this maxim, they are strengthened in
it. For while at the beginning the conclusio was urged upon them only by
premises raised above any proof, so that they take for granted sins of
Job which were not otherwise known to them; now, as they think, Job has
himself furnished them with proof that he is a sinner who has merited
such severe suffering. For whoever can speak so thoughtlessly and
passionately, so vexatiously and irreverently, as Job has done, is, in
their opinion, his own accuser and judge. It remains unperceived by them
that Job's mind has lost its balance by reason of the fierceness of his
temptation, and that in it nature and grace have fallen into a wild,
confused conflict. In those speeches they see the true state of Job's
spirit revealed. What, before his affliction, was the determining
principle of his inner life, seems to them now to be brought to light in
the words of the sufferer. Job is a godless one; and if he does affirm
his innocence so solemnly and strongly, and challenges the decision of
God, this assurance is only hypocritical, and put on against his better
knowledge and conscience, in order to disconcert his accusers, and to
evade their admonitions to repentance. It is לשׁון ערומים, a mere
stratagem, like that of one who is guilty, who thinks he can overthrow
the accusations brought against him by assuming the bold bearing of the
accuser. Seb. Schmid counts up quinque vitia, with which Eliphaz in the
introduction to his speech ([Job
15:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#001)) reproaches Job: vexatious
impious words, a crafty perversion of the matter, blind assumption of
wisdom, contempt of the divine word, and defiance against God. Of these
reproaches the first and last are well-grounded; Job does really sin in
his language and attitude towards God. With respect to the reproach of
assumed wisdom, Eliphaz pays Job in the same coin; and when he
reproaches Job with despising the divine consolations and gentle
admonitions they have addressed to him, we must not blame the friends,
since their intention is good. If, however, Eliphaz reproaches Job with
calculating craftiness, and thus regards his affirmation of his
innocence as a mere artifice, the charge cannot be more unjust, and must
certainly produce the extremest alienation between them. It is indeed
hard that Eliphaz regards the testimony of Job's conscience as
self-delusion; he goes still further, and pronounces it a fine-spun lie,
and denies not only its objective but also its subjective truth. Thus
the breach between Job and the friends widens, the entanglement of the
controversy becomes more complicated, and the poet allows the solution
of the enigma to ripen, by its becoming increasingly enigmatical and
entangled.

In this second round of the friends' speeches we meet with no new
thoughts whatever; only "in the second circle of the dispute everything
is more fiery than in the first" (Oetinger): the only new thing is the
harsher and more decided tone of their maintenance of the doctrine of
punishment, with which they confront Job. They cannot go beyond the
narrow limits of their dogma of retribution, and confine themselves now
to even the half of that narrowness; for since Job contemns the
consolations of God with which they have hitherto closed their speeches,
they now exclusively bring forward the terrible and gloomy phase of
their dogma in opposition to him. After Eliphaz has again given
prominence to the universal sinfulness of mankind, which Job does not at
all deny, he sketches from his own experience and the tradition of his
ancestors, which demands respect by reason of their freedom from all
foreign influence, with brilliant lines, a picture of the evil-doer,
who, being tortured by the horrors of an evil conscience, is overwhelmed
by the wrath of God in the midst of his prosperity; and his possessions,
children, and whole household are involved in his ruin. The picture is
so drawn, that in it, as in a mirror, Job shall behold himself and his
fate, both what he has already endured and what yet awaits him. מרמה is
the final word of the admonitory conclusion of his speech: Job is to
know that that which satisfies his inward nature is a fearful lie.

But what Job affirms of himself as the righteous one, is not מרמה. He
knows that he is טמא מטמא ([Job 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004)),
but he also knows that he is as צדיק תמים ([Job
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004)). He is conscious of the
righteousness of his endeavour, which rests on the groundwork of a mind
turned to the God of salvation, therefore a believing mind, - a
righteousness which is also accepted of God. The friends know nothing
whatever of this righteousness which is available before God. Fateor
quidem, says Calvin in his Institutiones, iii. 12, in libro Iob
mentionem fieri justitiae, quae excelsior est observatione legis; et
hanc distinctionem tenere operae pretium est, quia etiamsi quis legi
satisfaceret, ne sic quidem staret ad examen illius justitiae, quae
sensus omnes exsuperat. Mercier rightly observes: Eliphas perstringit
hominis naturam, quae tamen per fidem pura redditur. In man Eliphaz sees
only the life of nature and not the life of grace, which, because it is
the word of God, makes man irreproachable before God. He sees in Job
only the rough shell, and not the kernel; only the hard shell, and not
the pearl. We know, however, from the prologue, that Jehovah
acknowledged Job as His servant when he decreed suffering for him; and
this sufferer, whom the friends regard as one smitten of God, is and
remains, as this truly evangelical book will show to us, the servant of
Jehovah.
