### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 16:1</span></span>

[Kg1 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#007.md) adds a supplementary remark
concerning the words of Jehu ([Kg1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#002)..md), not to preclude an excuse that
might be made, in which case וגם would have to be taken in the sense of
nevertheless, or notwithstanding (Ewald, 354, a.), but to guard against
a misinterpretation by adding a new feature, or rather to preclude an
erroneous inference that might be drawn from the words, "I (Jehovah)
have made thee prince" ([Kg1 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#002).md), as
through Baasha had exterminated Nadab and his house by divine command
(Thenius). וגם simply means "and also," and is not to be connected
specially with יהוּא בּיד, but to be taken as belonging to the whole
sentence: "also the word of Jehovah had come to Baasha through Jehu, ...
not only because of the evil, etc., but also (ועל...ועל) because he had
slain him (Jeroboam)." With regard to this last reason, we must call to
mind the remark made at [Kg1 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#039.md),
viz., that the prediction of the prophet to Baasha gave him no right to
put himself forward arbitrarily as the fulfiller of the prophecy. The
very fact that Baasha continued Jeroboam's sin and caused the illegal
worship to be perpetuated, showed clearly enough that in exterminating
the family of Jeroboam he did not act under divine direction, but simply
pursued his own selfish ends.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 16:8</span></span>

The Reign of Elah. - As Baasha reigned from the third to the
twenty-sixth year of Asa, i.e., not quite twenty-four years, but only
twenty-three years and a few months, so his son Elah reigned from the
twenty-sixth to the twenty-seventh year of Asa, i.e., not quite two
years.

[Kg1 16:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#009.md)

Zimri, the commander of the half of his war-chariots, conspired against
him, and not only slew him, when he was intoxicated (שׁכּור שׁתה) at a
drinking bout in the house of Arza, the prefect of his palace, but after
ascending the throne exterminated the whole family of Baasha to the very
last man. The prefect of the palace was no doubt a party to the
conspiracy, and had probably arranged the drinking bout in his house for
the purpose of carrying it out. "He did not leave him בּקיר משׁתּין (see
at [Kg1 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010).md), either his avengers
(גּאליו, blood-relations, who might have avenged his death) or his
friends." These words simply serve to explain בּקיר משׁתּין, and show
that this phrase is to be understood as relating to males only.

[Kg1 16:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#012.md)

"According to the word of the Lord;" see at [Kg1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md). כּל־חטּאות אל, with regard to
all, i.e., on account of all the sins (compare [Kg1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#007), where על is used.md). בּהבליהם,
through their nothingnesses, i.e., their idols, by which the golden
calves are meant.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 16:15</span></span>

The Reign of Zimri lasted only seven days. As soon as the people of war
(העם), who were besieging Gibbethon (see at [Kg1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#027).md), heard of his conspiracy, his
usurpation of the throne, and his murderous deeds, they proclaimed Omri
king in the camp of the military commanders, and he at once, with all
Israel, i.e., all the army, raised the siege of Gibbethon, to lay siege
to Thirza. Now when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the
castle of the royal palace and burned the king's house over his own
head, as Sardanapalus did, according to Justin (Hist. i. 3). ארמון does
not mean harem (Ewald), but the high castle (from ארם, to be high); here
and in [Kg2 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025.md), the citadel of the
royal palace, which consisted of several buildings.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 16:19</span></span>

[Kg1 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#019.md) is connected with ויּמת in
[Kg1 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#018.md) : "and so died for his
sins," i.e., as a punishment for them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 16:21</span></span>

But Omri did not come into possession of an undisputed sovereignty
immediately upon the death of Zimri. The nation divided itself into two
halves; one half was behind Tibni, the son of Ginath (i.e., declared in
favour of Tibni), to make him king, the other adhered to Omri.
Nevertheless Omri's gained the upper hand over the party of Tibni, and
the latter died, whereupon Omri became king after four years, as we may
see from a comparison of [Kg1 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015.md),
[Kg1 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#016.md) with [Kg1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#023.md). The "people of Israel" ([Kg1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#021).md) are probably the fighting
people, so that the succession to the throne was decided by the
military. אהרי היה as in [Sa2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#010.md).
הזק, with an accusative instead of with על, in the sense of to
overpower, as in [Jer 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md). According
to Josephus (Ant. viii. 12, 5), Tibni was slain by his opponent; but
this is not contained in the words; on the contrary, all that is implied
in the connection of ויּמת with וגו ויּחזק וגו/ is that he met with his
death in the decisive engagement in which the opposing party triumphed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 16:23</span></span>

The Reign of Omri. - [Kg1 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#023.md). Omri
reigned twelve years, i.e., if we compare [Kg1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015.md) and [Kg1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#023.md) with [Kg1
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#029.md), reckoning from his rebellion
against Zimri; so that he only possessed the sole government for eight
years (or, more exactly, seven years and a few months), viz., from the
31st to the 38th years of Asa, and the conflict with Tibni for the
possession of the throne lasted about four years. "At Thirza he reigned
six years," i.e., during the four years of the conflict with Tibni, and
after his death two years more.

[Kg1 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024.md)

As soon as he had obtained undisputed possession of the throne, he
purchased the hill Shomron (Samaria) from Shemer (Semer) for two talents
of silver, about 5200 thalers (780 - Tr.), built houses upon it, and
named the town which he built after the former owner of the hill שׁמרון,
rendered by the lxx Σεμηρών here, but everywhere else Σαμάρεια
(Samaria), after the Chaldee form שׁמרין ([Ezr
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010.md), [Ezr
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#017).md). This city he made his seat
(Residenz, place of residence, or capital), in which he resided for the
last six years of his reign, and where he was buried after his death
([Kg1 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#028).md). Samaria continued to be
the capital of the kingdom of the ten tribes from that time forward, and
the residence of all succeeding kings of Israel until the destruction of
this kingdom after its conquest by Salmanasar ([Kg2
18:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009).md). The city was two hours and a
half to the north-west of Sichem, upon a mountain or hill in a
mountain-hollow (Bergkessel, lit., mountain-caldron) or basin of about
two hours in diameter, surrounded on all sides by still higher
mountains. "The mountains and valleys round about are still for the most
part arable, and are alive with numerous villages and diligent
cultivation." The mountain itself upon which Samaria stood is still
cultivated to the very top, and about the middle of the slope is
surrounded by a narrow terrace of level ground resembling a girdle. And
even higher up there are marks of smaller terraces, where streets of the
ancient city may possibly have run. After the captivity Samaria was
retaken and demolished by John Hyrcanus, and lay in ruins till Gabinius
the Roman governor rebuilt it (Joseph. Ant. xiii. 19, 2, 3, and iv. 5,
3). Herod the Great afterwards decorated it in a marvellous manner,
built a temple there to the emperor Augustus, and named the city after
him Σεβαστή, i.e., Augusta, from which arose the present name Sebuste or
Sebustieh, borne by a village which is still standing on the ancient
site: "a pitiable hamlet consisting of a few squalid houses, inhabited
by a band of plunderers, notorious as thieves even among their lawless
fellow-countrymen" (V. de Velde, i. p. 378). - But by the side of this
there are magnificent ruins of an ancient Johannite church, with the
reputed grave of John the Baptist and remains of limestone columns at
the foot of the mountain (cf., Robinson, Pal. iii. p. 136ff.; Van de
Velde, Syria and Pal. i. p. 374ff.; and C. v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 159,160).

[Kg1 16:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#025.md)

Omri also walked in the ways of Jeroboam, and acted worse than his
predecessors upon the throne. - For [Kg1
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#026.md) and [Kg1
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#027.md), compare [Kg1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#013.md) and [Kg1
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#014.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 16:29</span></span>

The ascent of the throne of Israel by Ahab ([Kg1
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#029).md) formed a turning-point for the
worse, though, as a comparison of [Kg1
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#030.md) with [Kg1
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#025.md) clearly shows, the way had
already been prepared by his father Omri.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 16:30</span></span>

Whereas the former kings of Israel had only perpetuated the sin of
Jeroboam, i.e., the calf-worship. or worship of Jehovah under the image
of an ox, which he had introduced, Ahab was not satisfied with this.
לכתּו הנקל ויהי, "it came to pass, was it too little?" i.e., because it
was too little (cf. Ewald, 362, a.) to walk in the sins of Jeroboam,
that he took as his wife Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal the king of
the Sidonians, and served Baal, and worshipped him. ויּלך before ויּעבד,
"he went and served," is a pictorial description of what took place, to
give greater prominence to the new turn of affairs. אתבּעל .sri (i.e.,
with Baal) is the Εἰθώβαλος (בּעל אתּו or Ἰθόβαλος: Jos. Ant. viii. 13,
1) mentioned by Menander in Josephus, c. Ap. i. 18, who was king of Tyre
and Sidon, and priest of Astarte, and who usurped the throne after the
murder of his brother, king Pheles, and reigned thirty-two years.
Jezebel (איזבל, i.e., probably without cohabitation, cf. [Gen
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#020.md), = untouched, chaste; not a
contraction of אביזבל, as Ewald, 273, b., supposes) was therefore, as
tyrant and murderess of the prophets, a worthy daughter of her father,
the idolatrous priest and regicide. Baal (always הבּעל with the article,
the Baal, i.e., Lord κατ ̓ ἐξοχήν) was the principal male deity of the
Phoenicians and Canaanites, and generally of the western Asiatics,
called by the Babylonians בּל = בּעל ([Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001).md), Βῆλος, and as the sun-god was
worshipped as the supporter and first principle of psychical life and of
the generative and reproductive power of nature (see at [Jdg
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013).md). Ahab erected an altar to this
deity הבּעל בּית, in the house (temple) of Baal, which he had built at
Samaria. The worship of Baal had its principal seat in Tyre, where
Hiram, the contemporary of David and Solomon, had built for it a
splendid temple and placed a golden pillar (χρυσοῦν κίονα) therein,
according to Dius and Menander, in Joseph. Ant. viii. 5, 3, and c. Ap.
i. 18. Ahab also erected a similar pillar (מצּבה) to Baal in his temple
at Samaria (vid., [Kg2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#002.md); [Kg2
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#027).md). For statues of images of Baal
are not met with in the earlier times; and the בּעלים are not statues of
Baal, but different modifications of that deity. It was only in the
later temple of Baal or Hercules at Tyre that there was, as Cicero
observes (Verr. iv. 43), ex aere simulacrum ipsius Herculis, quo non
facile quidquam dixerim me vidisse pulcrius.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 16:33</span></span>

"And Ahab made את־האשׁרה, i.e., the Asherah belonging to the temple of
Baal" (see at [Jdg 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025.md) and [Exo
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013).md), an idol of Astarte (see at
[Kg1 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 16:34</span></span>

In his time Hil the Bethelite (האלי בּית; compare Ges. 111. 1 with 86,
2. 5) built Jericho: "he laid the foundation of it with Abiram his
first-born, and set up its gates with Segub his youngest, according to
the word of Jehovah," etc. (for the explanation see the Comm. on [Jos
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026).md). The restoration of this city as
a fortification, upon which Joshua had pronounced the curse, is
mentioned as a proof how far ungodliness had progressed in Israel;
whilst the fulfilment of the curse upon the builder shows how the Lord
will not allow the word of His servants to be transgressed with
impunity. Jericho, on the border of the tribe of Ephraim ([Jos
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007).md), which was allotted to the
Benjaminites ([Jos 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#021).md), had come
into the possession of the kingdom of Israel on the falling away of the
ten tribes from the royal house of David, and formed a border city of
that kingdom, through the fortification of which Ahab hoped to secure to
himself the passage across the Jordan.
