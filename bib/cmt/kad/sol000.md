The Song of Solomon

Introduction

The Song is the most obscure book of the Old Testament. Whatever
principle of interpretation one may adopt, there always remains a number
of inexplicable passages, and just such as, if we understood them, would
help to solve the mystery. And yet the interpretation of a book
presupposes from the beginning that the interpreter has mastered the
idea of the whole. It has thus become an ungrateful task; for however
successful the interpreter may be in the separate parts, yet he will be
thanked for his work only when the conception as a whole which he has
decided upon is approved of.

It is a love-poem. But why such a minne-song in the canon? This question
gave rise in the first century, in the Jewish schools, to doubts as to
the canonicity of the book. Yet they firmly maintained it; for they
presupposed that it was a spiritual and not a secular love-poem. They
interpreted it allegorically. The Targum paraphrases it as a picture of
the history of Israel from the Exodus to the coming of the Messiah. The
bride is the congregation of Israel; and her breasts, to quote one
example, are interpreted of the Messiah in His lowliness and the Messiah
in His glory. But "Solomon" is an anthropomorphic representation of
Jahve Himself. And all the instances of the occurrence of the name, with
one exception, are therefore regarded as an indirect allegorical
designation of the God of peace (vid., Norzi under [Sol
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001).md). And because of its apparently
erotic, but in truth mysterious contents, it was a Jewish saying, as
Origen and Jerome mention, that the Song should not be studied by any
one till he was thirty years of age (nisi quis aetatem sacerdotalis
ministerii, id est, tricesimum annum impleverit). Because, according to
the traditional Targ. interpretation, it begins with the departure out
of Egypt, it forms a part of the liturgy for the eighth day of the
Passov. The five Megilloths are arranged in the calendar according to
their liturgical use.

(Note: The Song. was read on the 8th day of the Passover; Ruth, on the
second Shabuoth Pentecost; Lamentations, on the 9th Ab; Ecclesiastes, on
the 3rd Succoth Tabernacles; Esther, between the 11th and 16th Adar
feast of Purim.)

In the church this synagogal allegorizing received a new turn. They saw
represented in the Song the mutual love of Christ and His church, and it
thus became a mine of sacred mysticism in which men have dug to the
present day. Thus Origen explains it in twelve volumes. Bernhard of
Clairvaux died (1153) after he had delivered eighty-six sermons on it,
and had only reached the end of the second chapter;

(Note: Vid., Fernbacher's Die Reden des. h. Bernhard ber das Hohelied,
prefaced by Delitzsch. Leipzig 1862.)

and his disciple Gilbert Porretanus carried forward the interpretation
in forty-eight sermons only to [Sol
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010.md), when he died. Perluigi de
Palestrina gained by his twenty-nine motettoes on the Song (1584) the
honoured name of Principe della Musica. In modern times this
allegorico-mystical interpretation is represented in the department of
exegesis (Hengst.), sermon (F. W. Krummacher), and poetry (Gustav Jahn),
as well as of music (Neukomm's duet: Er und sie), and even of painting
(Ludw. von Maydell).

If the Song is to be understood allegorically, then Shulamith is the
personification of the congregation of Israel, and mediately of the
church. All other interpretations fall below this. Hug (1813)
understands by the "beloved" the kingdom of the ten tribes longing after
a reunion with the house of David; and Heinr. Aug. Hahn (1852), the
Japhetic heathendom. Ludw. Noack (1869) has even changed and modified
the readings of the Heb. text, that he might find therein the ballads of
a Tirhka romance, i.e., a series of pictures of the events occurring
between Samaria and her Aethiopian lover Tirhka, of the years (b.c.)
702, 691, and 690. These are the aberrations of individuals. Only one
other interpretation recommends itself. Solomon's chairsma and aim was
the Chokma. The Peshito places over the Song the superscription חכמת
דחכמתא. Is Shulamith, then, the personification of wisdom, like Dante's
Beatrice? Rosenmller (1830) is the most recent representative of this
view; we ought then to have in Dante's Convito the key to the
allegorical interpretation. He there sings sweet songs of love of his
mistress Philosophy. But there is nothing in the description here to
show that Shulamith is Wisdom. The one expression, "Thou shalt teach me"
([Sol 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002).md), warns us against
attempting to put Wisdom in the place of the church, as a reversal of
the facts of the case.

But if one understands the church to be meant, there yet remains much
that is inexplicable. Who are the sixty queens and the eighty concubines
([Sol 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008).md)? And why are the heroes
just sixty ([Sol 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007).md)? The synagogal
and church interpretation, in spite of two thousand years' labour, has
yet brought to light no sure results, but only numberless absurdities,
especially where the Song describes the lovers according to their
members from head to foot and from foot to head. But notwithstanding all
this, it is certain that the "great mystery" ([Eph
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032).md) mirrors itself in the Song. In
this respect it resembles the love of Joseph and Zuleikha, often sung by
the Arabian poets, which is regarded by the mystics

(Note: Vid., Hammer-Purgstall's Das hohe Lied der Liebe der Araber,
1854.)

as a figure of the love of God towards the soul longing for union with
Him. Shulamith is a historic personage; not the daughter of Pharaoh, as
has been often maintained since the days of Theodore of Mopsuestia (died
429) and Abulfaraj (died 1286), but a country maiden of humble rank,
who, by her beauty and by the purity of her soul, filled Solomon with a
love for her which drew him away from the wantonness of polygamy, and
made for him the primitive idea of marriage, as it is described in [Gen
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#023.md)., a self-experienced reality.
This experience he here sings, idealizing it after the manner of a poet;
i.e., removing the husk of that which is accidental, he goes back to its
kernel and its essential nature. We have before us six dramatic figures,
each in two divisions, which represent from within the growth of this
delightful relation to its conclusion. This sunny glimpse of
paradisaical love which Solomon experienced, again became darkened by
the insatiableness of passion; but the Song of Songs has perpetuated it,
and whilst all other songs of Solomon have disappeared, the providence
of God has preserved this one, the crown of them all. It is a protest
against polygamy, although only in the measure one might expect from the
Mosaic standpoint. For the Tra recognises, indeed, in its primitive
history monogamy as the original form ([Mat
19:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004).md); but in its legislation,
giving up the attempt to abolish polygamy, it is satisfied with its
limitation ([Deu 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017).md).

The Song celebrates paradisaical, but yet only natural love (minne). It
stands, however, in the canon of the church, because Solomon is a type
of Him of whom it can be said, "a greater than Solomon is here" ([Mat
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#012).md). Referred to Him the antitype,
the earthly contents receive a heavenly import and glorification. We see
therein the mystery of the love of Christ and His church shadowed forth,
not, however, allegorically, but typically. The allegory has to coincide
throughout with that which is represented; but the type is always only a
type subtractis subtrahendis, and is exceedingly surpassed by the
antitype. In this sense Jul. Sturm (1854) has paraphrased the Song under
the title of "Zwei Rosen" (two roses) (the typical and the antitypical).
When my monograph on the Song appeared (1851), a notice of it in
Colani's Revue de Theologie (1852) began with the frivolous remark: "Ce
n'est pas la premire rverie de ce genre sur le livre en question; plt
Dieu que ce ft la dernire;" and Hitzig (1855) judged that "such a work
might properly have remained unprinted; it represents nothing but a
perverse inconsiderate literature which has no conception of scientific
judgment and industry." But this work (long since out of print and now
rare) was the fruit of many years of study. The commentary here given is
based on it, but does not put it out of date. It broke with the
allegorizing interpretation, the untenableness of which appears against
his will in Hengstenberg's commentary (1853); it broke also with the
theory which regards the poem as a history of Solomon's unsuccessful
seductive efforts to gain the Shulamite's affections, a theory which
Hitzig (1855) tries to exempt from the necessity of doing violence to
the text by arbitrarily increasing the number of speakers and actors in
the plot. I certainly succeeded in finding the right key to the
interpretation of this work. Zckler has recognised my book

(Note: Das Hohelied undersucht u. ausg. Leipzig 1851.)

as presenting "the only correct interpretation of its design and
contents." Kingsbury, author of the notes on the Son in The Speaker's
Commentary, has expressed the same judgment. Poets such as Stadelmann
(Das Hohelied, ein dramatisches Gedicht = The Song of Songs: a dramatic
poem, 1870) and J. Koch, late pastor of St. Mary's in Parchim (died
1873), have recognised in their beautiful German paraphrases my
interpretation as natural and in conformity with the text; and for
twenty years I have constantly more and more seen that the solution
suggested by me is the right and only satisfactory one.

Shulamith is not Pharaoh's daughter. The range of her thoughts is not
that of a king's daughter, but of a rustic maiden; she is a stranger
among the daughters of Jerusalem, not because she comes from a foreign
land, but because she is from the country; she is dark-complexioned, not
from the sun of her more southern home, but from the open sunshine to
which she has been exposed as the keeper of a vineyard; in body and soul
she is born to be a princess, but in reality she is but the daughter of
a humble family in a remote part of Galilee; hence the child-like
simplicity and the rural character of her thoughts, her joy in the open
fields, and her longing after the quiet life of her village home.
Solomon appears here in loving fellowship with a woman such as he had
not found among a thousand ([Ecc
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#028).md); and although in social rank far
beneath him, he raises her to an equality with himself. That which
attached her to him is not her personal beauty alone, but her beauty
animated and heightened by nobility of soul. She is a pattern of simple
devotedness, naive simplicity, unaffected modesty, moral purity, and
frank prudence, - a lily of the field, more beautifully adorned than he
could claim to be in all his glory. We cannot understand the Song of
Songs unless we perceive that it presents before us not only Shulamith's
external attractions, but also all the virtues which make her the idea
of all that is gentlest and noblest in woman. Her words and her silence,
her doing and suffering, her enjoyment and self-denial, her conduct as
betrothed, as a bride, and as a wife, her behaviour towards her mother,
her younger sister, and her brothers, - all this gives the impression of
a beautiful soul in a body formed as it were from the dust of flowers.
Solomon raises this child to the rank of queen, and becomes beside this
queen as a child. The simple one teaches the wise man simplicity; the
humble draws the king down to her level; the pure accustoms the
impetuous to self-restraint. Following her, he willingly exchanges the
bustle and the outward splendour of court life for rural simplicity,
wanders gladly over mountain and meadow if he has only her; with her he
is content to live in a lowly cottage. The erotic external side of the
poem has thus an ethical background. We have here no "song of loves"
([Eze 33:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#032).md) having reference to
sensual gratification. The rabbinical proverb is right when it utters
its threat against him who would treat this Song, or even a single verse
of it, as a piece of secular literature.

(Note: Cf. Tosefta Sanhedrin xii., Sanhedrin iii.a, and the commencement
of the tract Kalla.)

The Song transfigures natural but holy love. Whatever in the sphere of
the divinely-ordered marriage relation makes love the happiest, firmest
bond uniting two souls together, is presented to us here in living
pictures. "The Song," says Herder, "is written as if in Paradise. Adam's
song: Thou art my second self! Thou art mine own! echoes in it in speech
and interchanging song from end to end." The place of the book in the
canon does not need any further justification; that its reception was
favoured also by the supposition that it represented the intercourse
between Jahve and the congregation of Israel, may be conjectured indeed,
but is not established. The supposition, however, would have been false;
for the book is not an allegory, and Solomon is by no means an
Allegorumenon of God. But the congregation is truly a bride ([Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md); [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005).md), and Solomon a type of the
Prince of peace ([Isa 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md); [Luk
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#031).md), and marriage a mystery, viz.,
as a pattern of the loving relation of God and His Christ to the church
([Eph 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032).md). The Song has consequently
not only a historico-ethical, but also a typico-mystical meaning. But
one must be on his guard against introducing again the allegorical
interpretation as Soltz (1850) has done, under the misleading title of
the typical interpretation. The typical interpretation proceeds on the
idea that the type and the antitype do not exactly coincide; the
mystical, that the heavenly stamps itself in the earthly, but is yet at
the same time immeasurably different from it. Besides, the
historico-ethical interpretation is to be regarded as the proper
business of the interpreter. But because Solomon is a type (vaticinium
reale) of the spiritual David in his glory, and earthly love a shadow of
the heavenly, and the Song a part of sacred history and of canonical
Scripture, we will not omit here and there to indicate that the love
subsisting between Christ and His church shadows itself forth in it.

But the prevailing view which Jacob (1771) established, and which has
predominated since Umbreit (1820) and Ewald (1826), is different from
ours. According to them, the Song celebrates the victory of the chaste
passion of conjugal love. The beloved of Shulamith is a shepherd, and
Solomon acts toward her a part like that of Don Juan with Anna, or of
Faust with Gretchen. Therefore, of course, his authorship is excluded,
although Anton (1773), the second oldest representative of this
so-called shepherd hypothesis, supposes that Solomon at a later period
of his life recognised his folly, and now here magnanimously praises the
fidelity of Shulamith, who had spurned his enticements away from her;
and a Jewish interpreter, B. Hollnder (1871), following Hezel (1780),
supposes that Solomon represents himself as an enticer, only to exhibit
the idea of female virtue as triumphing over the greatest seduction.
Similarly also Godet (1867),

(Note: Vid., Jahrg. i. No. 22-24 of the Berne Kirchenfreund.)

who, resting on Ewald, sees here a very complicated mystery presented by
Solomon himself, and pointing far beyond him: Solomon, the earthly
Messiah; Shulamith, the true Israel; the shepherd, Jahve, and as Jahve
who is about to come, the heavenly Solomon; the little sisters,
heathenism - it is the old allegory, able for everything, only with
changed names and a different division of the parts which here comes in
again by the back-door of the seduction-history.

(Note: And in this Godet stands not alone. The Jewish interpreter Malbim
(1850) accepts also this seduction-history: Solomon = the sensual
impulse; Shulamith = the spirit-soul; the little sister = the natural
soul; and Shulamith's beloved = the heavenly Friend, the Shepherd of the
universe.)

Thus this seduction-history has not put an end to the over-ingenious
allegorizing. In one point, however, at least, it has aided in the
understanding of the Song. Herder saw in the Song a collection of
Solomonic songs of love, which he translated (1778), as the oldest and
the most beautiful, from the Orient. But Goethe, who in the Westst.
Divan (1819) praises the Song as the most divine of all love-songs,
recognised, after the appearance of Umbreit's Comm., the unity also of
the "inexplicably mysterious."

We are not conscious of any prejudice which makes it impossible for us
to do justice to the interpretation to which Umbreit and Ewald gave
currency. It abundantly accounts for the reception of the book into the
canon, for so interpreted it has a moral motive and aim. And the
personality of Solomon has certainly not merely a bright side, which is
typical, but also a dark side, which is pregnant with dark issues for
his kingdom; it may perhaps be possible that in the Song the latter, and
not the former, is brought to view. Then, indeed, the inscription would
rest on an error; for that in this case also the Solomonic authorship
could be maintained, is an idea which, in the traditional-apologetical
interest, mounts up to a faith in the impossible. But the truth goes
beyond the tradition; the inscription would then indicate a traditional
interpretation which, as is evident from the book itself, does not
correspond with its original meaning and aim. "It is clear to every
unprejudiced mind," says Gustav Baur,

(Note: Literaturb. der Darmst. Kirchenzeitung, 1851, pp. 114-146, and
1854, No. 11.)

"that in [Sol 2:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010.md); [Sol
4:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008.md), a different person speaks from
the royal wooer; for (1) Solomon only says, 'my friend' [Sol
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#015.md), etc.; while, on the other hand,
the shepherd heaps up flattering words of warmest love; (2) Solomon
praises only the personal beauty of the woman; the shepherd, the sweet
voice, the enchanting look, the warm love, the incorruptible chastity of
his beloved; - in short, the former reveals the eye and the sensuousness
of the king; the latter, the heart of a man who is animated by the
divine flame of true love." We only ask, meanwhile, whether words such
as [Sol 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013.md) are less sensuous than
[Sol 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005.md), and whether the image of the
twin gazelles is not more suitable in the mouth of the shepherd than the
comparison of the attractions of Shulamith with the exotic plants of
Solomon's garden? "In three passages," says Godet, "lies open the
slender thread which Ewald's penetrating eye discovered under the
flowers and leaves which adorn the poem: 'The kings has brought me into
his palace' ([Sol 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004).md); 'I knew not
how my heart has brought me to the chariots of a princely people' ([Sol
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012).md); 'I was a wall, and have found
peace before his eyes' ([Sol 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#010).md)."
The same critic also finds in several passages an apparent contrariety
between Solomon and the shepherd. "Observe," says he, "e.g., [Sol
1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012.md), where the shepherd - whom
Shulamith calls her spikenard, and compares to a bunch of flowers on her
breast - is placed over against the king, who sits on his divan; or [Sol
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009.md). where, suddenly interrupting the
king, she diverts the words which he speaks concerning herself to her
beloved; or [Sol 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md), where, leaning
on the arm of her beloved, she expresses her disregard for riches, with
which Solomon had sought to purchase her love." But spikenard is not the
figure of the shepherd, not at all the figure of a man; and she who is
praised as a "prince's daughter" ([Sol
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#002).md) cannot say ([Sol
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012).md) that, enticed by curiosity to
see the royal train, she was taken prisoner, and now finds herself,
against her will, among the daughters of Jerusalem; and he whom she
addresses ([Sol 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012).md) can be no other
than he with whom she now finds herself in her parents' home. The course
of the exposition will show that the shepherd who is distinguished from
Solomon is nothing else than a shadow cast by the person of Solomon.

The Song is a dramatic pastoral. The ancients saw in it a carmen
bucolicum mimicum. Laurentius Petrus, in his Heb.-Danish Paraphrase
(1640), calls it carmen bucolicum, ἀμοιβαῖον (δραματικόν); George
Wachter (1722), an "opera divided into scenic parts." It acquires the
character of a pastoral poem from this, that Shulamith is a shepherdess,
that she thinks of Solomon as a shepherd, and that Solomon condescends
to occupy the sphere of life and of thought of the shepherdess. It is
not properly an idyll, nor yet properly a drama. Not an idyll, because
the life-image which such a miniature drawn from life - such, e.g., as
the Adon. of Theocritus presents to us - unfolds itself within a brief
time without interruption; in the Song, on the other hand, not merely
are the places and persons interchanged, but also the times. The whole,
however, does not fall into little detached pictures; but there runs
through this wreath of figures a love-relation, which embodies itself
externally and internally before our eyes, and attains the end of its
desire, and shows itself on the summit of this end as one that is not
merely sensuous, but moral. The Song is certainly not a theatrical
piece:

(Note: "Shulamith," says E. F. Friedrich (1855 and 1866), "is the oldest
theatrical piece in existence." Ewald and Bttcher, who find not fewer
than twelve persons mentioned in it, think that it was represented on an
actual stage. Then, indeed, it would be the oldest drama - older than
Thespis and Kaldasa. For the Sakuntla and the drama Der Kaufmann und die
Bajadere belong to the first century of our era.)

the separate pieces would necessarily have been longer if the poet had
had in view the changes of theatrical scenery. But at all events the
theatre is not a Semitic institution, but is of Indo-Persian Greek
origin. Jewish poetry attempted the drama only after it began in
Alexandrinism

(Note: Vid., my Prolegomena to Luzzatto's מגדל עז (Heb. Paraphrase of
the Pastors fido of Guarini), 1837, pp. 24-32.)

to emulate Greece. Grtz' (1871) polemic against the dramatists is so far
justified. But yet we see, as in the Book of Job, so in the Song, the
drama in process of formation from the lyric and narrative form of
poetry, as it has developed among the Greeks from the lyric, and among
the Indians from the epic. In the Book of Job the colloquies are all
narrative. In the Song this is never the case;

(Note: Similar is the relation between Homer, where the speakers are
introduced with narrative, and our national epics, the Nibelungen and
Gudrun, which become dramatic when the action and the feeling rise to a
higher elevation: the words of the different persons follow each other
without introduction, so that here the manner of the singer had to
become dramatic.)

for the one expression, "answered my beloved, and said to me" ([Sol
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010).md), is not to be compared with,
"and Job answered and said:" the former expression indicates a
monologue. And in the "Daughters of Jerusalem" ([Job
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005), etc..md) we have already something
like the chorus of the Greek drama. The ancient Greek MSS bear
involuntary testimony to this dramatic character of the Song. There are
several of them which prefix to the separate addresses the names of the
persons speaking, ας ἡ νύμφη ὁ νυμφίος.

(Note: Vid., Repert. fr bibl. u. morgenl. Lit. viii. (1781), p. 180. The
Archimandrite Porphyrios describes such a MS in his (Russian) Reisewerk
(1856).)

And the Aethiopic translation makes five separate pieces, probably, as
the Cod. Sinait. shows, after the example of the lxx, which appear as
divisions into Acts.

The whole falls into the following six Acts: -

(1.) The mutual affection of the lovers, 1:2-2:7, with the conclusion,
"I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem."

(2.) The mutual seeking and finding of the lovers, 2:8-3:5, with the
conclusion, "I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem."

(3.) The fetching of the bride, and the marriage, 3:6-5:1, beginning
with, "Who is this ... ?" and ending with, "Drink and be drunken,
beloved."

(4.) Love scorned, but won again, 5:2-6:9.

(5.) Shulamith the attractively fair but humble princess, 6:10-8:4,
beginning with, "Who is this ... ?" and ending with, "I adjure you, ye
daughters of Jerusalem."

(6.) The ratification of the covenant of love in Shulamith's home, [Sol
8:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md), beginning with, "Who is this
... ?"

Zckler reckons only five acts, for he comprehends Song 5:2-8:4 in one;
but he himself confesses its disproportionate length; and the reasons
which determine him are invalid; for the analogy of the Book of Job,
which, besides, including the prologue and the epilogue, falls into
seven formal parts, can prove nothing; and the question, "Who is this?"
[Sol 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010.md), which he interprets as a
continuation of the encomium in [Sol
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md), is rather to be regarded, like
[Sol 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#008.md); [Sol
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md), as a question with reference to
her who is approaching, and as introducing a new act; for the
supposition that [Sol 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md) requires to
be further explained by a statement of what was included in the
"blessing" and the "praising" is unwarranted, since these are ideas
requiring no supplement to explain them ([Gen
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#013.md); [Psa
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003.md); [Psa
107:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#032).md), and the poet, if he had
wished to explain the praise as to its contents, would have done this
otherwise (cf. [Pro 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#028)..md) than in a
way so fitted to mislead. Rightly, Thrupp (1862) regards [Sol
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010.md) as the chorus of the daughters of
Jerusalem. He divides as follows: (1) The Anticipation, 1:2-2:7; (2) the
Awaiting, 2:8-3:5; (3) the Espousal and its Results, 3:6-5:1; (4) the
Absence, [Sol 5:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002); (5.md) the Presence,
5:9-8:4; (6) Love's Triumph, [Sol
8:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md), with the Conclusion, [Sol
8:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#013.md). But how can [Sol
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009.md) begin a new formal part? It is
certainly the reply to Shulamith's adjuration of the daughters of
Jerusalem, and not at all the commencement of a new scene, much less of
a new act.

In our division into six parts, the separate acts, for the most part
necessarily, and in every case without any violence, divide themselves
into two scenes each, thus: -

Act Scene 1 Scene 2 I: 1:2-2:7 [Sol
1:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md) 1:9-2:7 II: 2:8-3:5 [Sol
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md). [Sol
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001.md) III: 3:6-5:1 [Sol
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006.md). 4:1-5:1 IV: 5:2-6:9 5:2-6:3 [Sol
6:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md) V: 6:10-8:4 6:10-7:6 7:7-8:4 VI:
[Sol 8:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md) [Sol
8:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md) [Sol
8:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md)

The first scene of the first act I formerly (1851) extended to [Sol
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#017.md), but it reaches only to [Sol
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md); for up to this point Solomon is
absent, but with [Sol 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md) he begins to
converse with Shulamith, and the chorus is silent - the scene has thus
changed. Kingsbury in his translation (1871) rightly places over [Sol
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md) the superscription, "The Entrance
of the King."

The change of scenery is not regulated in accordance with stage
decoration, for the Song is not a theatrical piece.

(Note: Ephr. Epstein, surgeon in Cincinnati, in a review of Von Grtz'
Comm. in The Israelite (1872), calls the Song quite in our sense, "a
dramatic poem, though not a complete scenic drama." But the bridal
procession in the third act is not of this character - he sees in it a
return from a hunting expedition.)

The first act is played both in the dining-room and in the wine-room
appertaining to the women of the royal palace. In the second act,
Shulamith is again at home. In the third act, which represents the
marriage, the bride makes her entrance into Jerusalem from the
wilderness, and what we further then hear occurs during the marriage
festival. The locality of the fourth act is Jerusalem, without being
more particularly defined. That of the fifth act is the park of Etam,
and then Solomon's country house there. And in the sixth act we see the
newly-married pair first in the way to Shulem, and then in Shulamith's
parental home. In the first half of the dramatic pictures, Shulamith
rises to an equality with Solomon; in the second half, Solomon descends
to an equality with Shulamith. At the close of the first, Shulamith is
at home in the king's palace; at the close of the second, Solomon is at
home with her in her Galilean home.

In our monograph on the Song (1851), we believe we have proved that it
distinctly bears evidences of its Solomonic origin. The familiarity with
nature, the fulness and extent of its geographical and artistic
references, the mention made of so many exotic plants and foreign
things, particularly of such objects of luxury as the Egyptian horses,
point to such an authorship; in common with Ps 72, it has the
multiplicity of images taken from plants; with the Book of Job, the
dramatic form; with the Proverbs, manifold allusions to Genesis. If not
the production of Solomon, it must at least have been written near his
time, since the author of Prov 1-9, the introduction to the older Book
of Proverbs, for the origin of which there is no better defined period
than that of Jehoshaphat (909-883 b.c.), and the author or authors of
the supplement (Prov 22:17-24:22), reveal an acquaintance with the Song.
Ewald also, and Hitzig, although denying that Solomon is the author
because it is directed against him, yet see in it a produce of the most
flourishing state of the language and of the people; they ascribe it to
a poet of the northern kingdom about 950 b.c. Modern Jewish criticism
surpasses, however, on the field of O.T. history, the anachronisms of
the Tbingen school. As Zunz has recently (Deut. Morgenl. Zeitsch.
xxvii.) sought to show that the Book of Leviticus was written about a
thousand years after Moses, that there never was a prophet Ezekiel, that
the dates of this book are fictitious, etc.; so Grtz attempts to prove
that the Song in its Graecising language and Greek customs and symbols
bears evidences of the Syro-Macedonian age;

(Note: So also, on linguistic grounds, Ant. Theod. Hartmann in Winer's
Zeitschr. 1829.)

that the poet was acquainted with the idylls of Theocritus and the Greek
erotic poets, and, so far as his Israelitish standpoint admitted,
imitates them; and that he placed an ideal picture of pure Jewish love
over against the immorality of the Alexandrine court and its Hellenistic
partisans, particularly of Joseph b. Tobia, the collector of taxes in
the time of Ptolemy Euergetes (247-221 b.c.), - a picture in which "the
Shepherd,"

(Note: Epstein, in true American style, calls him "the bogus shepherd.")

now grown into a fixed idea, renders welcome service, in contrast to
Solomon, in whom the poet glances at the court of Alexandria. One is
thus reminded of Kirschbaum (1833), who hears in [Eze
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#005.md) an echo of Cicero's dixi et
salvavi animam, and in the [Sol 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md),
a reference to the Bethar of Barcochba. We do not deny the penetration
which this chief of Jewish historians has expended on the establishment
of his hypothesis; but the same penetration may prove that the
Babylon.-Assyr. "syllabaries" of the time of Asurbanipal (667-626)
belong to the Greek era, because there occurs therein the word azamillav
(knife), and this is the Greek σμίλη; or that the author of Prov 1-9
alludes in [Pro 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#023.md) to Eros and his
quivers, and in [Pro 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md) betrays a
knowledge of the seven artes liberales. Parallels to the Song are found
wherever sensuous love is sung, also in the Pastoralia of Longus,
without the least dependence of one author upon another. And if such a
relation is found between Theocritus and the Song, then it might rather
be concluded that he became acquainted with it in Alexandria from Jewish
literates,

(Note: Vid.Gesch. der jud. Poesie, p. 205ff. Not as Joh. Gott. Lessing
(Eclogae regis Salomonis, 1777), the brother of Gotthold Ephraim
Lessing, supposes: through the lxx translation; for the Song was among
the books latest in being translated.)

than that the author of the Song has imitated Greek models, as Immanuel
Romi, the Arabians and Dante; besides, it is not at all the Song lying
before us which Grtz expounds, but the Song modified by violent
corrections of all kinds, and fitted to the supposed tendency. Thus he
changes ([Sol 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003).md) שׁמניך (thine
unguent) into בּשׂמיך, and תּוּרק שׁמן (ointment poured forth) into
תּמרוּק שׁמך. - Shulamith says this of her beautiful shepherd, and what
follows ([Sol 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004).md) the damsels say to
him; he changes משׁכני into משׁכנו, הביאני into הביאנו, and then
remarks: "Shulamith mentions it as to the praise of her beloved, that
the damsels, attracted by his beauty, love him, and say to him, 'Draw
us, we will run after thee; though the king brought us into his
changers, we would rejoice only with thee, and prefer thee to the king.'
" His too confident conjectural criticism presents us with imaginary
words, such as ([Sol 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#010).md) אהבים
(ebony); with unfortunate specimens of style, such as ([Sol
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010).md), "Thou hast made me weak, O
daughter of Aminadab;" and with unheard-of renderings, such as ([Sol
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005).md), "There where thy mother has
wounded thee;" for he supposes that Shulamith is chastised by her mother
because of her love. This Song is certainly not written by Solomon, nor
yet does it date from the Syro-Macedonian time, but was invented in
Breslau in the 19th century of our era!

Grtz (1871) has placed yet farther down than the Song the Book of
Ecclesiastes, in which he has also found Graecisms; the tyrannical king
therein censured is, as he maintains, Herod the Great, and the last
three verses ([Ecc 12:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#012).md) are not
so much the epilogue of the book as that of the Hagiographa which closes
with it. Certainly, if this was first formed by the decision of the
conference in Jerusalem about 65, and of the synod in Jabne about 90,
and the reception of the Books of Ecclesiastes and the Song was carried
not without controversy, then it lies near to regard these two books as
the most recent, originating not long before. But the fact is this: We
learn from Jud-ajim iii. 5, iv. 6, cf. Edujoth v. 3, that in the decade
before the destruction of Jerusalem the saying was current among the
disciples of Hillel and Shammai, that "all Holy Scriptures (Kethubîm)
pollute the hands;"

(Note: Vid., for the explanation of this, my essay, "Das Hohelied
verunreinigt die Hnde," in the Luth. Zeitsch. 1854. The Tra and the
Theruma-food, as being both reckoned holy, were usually placed together
in the temple. It was discovered that the sacred books were thereby
exposed to damage by mice; and hence, to prevent their being brought any
longer into contact with the Theruma, the Rabbins decided that they were
henceforth to be regarded as unclean, and they gave forth the decree,
"All Holy Scriptures pollute the hand." This decree was applicable only
to holy or inspired books. Vid., Ginsburg on the Song, p. 3, note.)

but that the question whether Ecclesiastes is included was answered in
the negative by the school of Shammai, and in the affirmative by the
school of Hillel - of the Song nothing is here said. But we learn
further, that several decades later the Song also was comprehended in
this controversy along with Ecclesiastes; and in an assembly of
seventy-two doctors of the law in Jabne, that decree, "all Holy
Scriptures (Kethubîm) pollute the hands," was extended to Ecclesiastes
and the Song. R. Akiba (or some one else) asserted, in opposition to
those who doubted the canonicity of the Song, "No day in the whole
history of the world is so much worth as that in which the Song of Songs
was given; for all the Kethubîm are holy, but the Song of Songs is most
holy." From this Grtz draws the conclusion that the Hagiographa was
received as canonical for the first time about 65, and that its canon
was finally fixed so as to include Ecclesiastes and the Song, not till
about 90; but this conclusion rests on the false supposition that "Holy
Scriptures" (Kethubîm) is to be understood exclusive of the Hagiographa,
which is just as erroneous as that Sephârim designates the prophets,
with the exclusion of the Hagiographa. Holy Kethubîm is a general
designation, without distinction, of all the canonical books, e.g.,
Bathra i. 6, and Sephârim in like manner, with the exception only of the
Tra, Megilla i. 8, 333. 1, Shabbath 115b. And it rests on a
misapprehension of the question discussed: the question was not whether
Ecclesiastes and the Song should be admitted, but whether they had been
justly admitted, and whether the same sacred character should be
ascribed to them as to the other holy writings; for in Bathra 14b-15a
(without a parallel in the Palest. Talmud) the enriching of the canon by
the addition of the Books of Isaiah, Proverbs, the Song, and
Ecclesiastes, is ascribed to the Hezekiah-Collegium ([Pro
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005).md), and thus is dated back in the
period before the rise of the great synagogue. That Philo does not cite
the Song proves nothing; he cites none of the five Megilloth. But
Josephus (C. Ap. 1, 8; cf. Euseb. H. E. iii. 10), since he enumerates
five books of the Mosaic law, thirteen books of prophetic history and
prediction, and four books of a hymno-ethical character, certainly means
by these four the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song, which in
the Alexandrine canon stand thus connected. His work, Cont. Apion, was
not indeed written till about 100 a.d.; but Josephus there speaks of a
fact which had existed for centuries. The Song and Ecclesiastes formed
part of the sacred books among the Hellenists as well as among the
Palestinian Jews of the first Christian century; but, as those Talmud
notices show, not without opposition. The Old Testament canon, as well
as that of the New Testament, had then also its Antilegomena. These
books were opposed not because of their late origin, but because their
contents apparently militated against the truth of revelation and the
spiritual nature of revealed religion. Similar doubts, though not so
strong and lasting, were also uttered with reference to Proverbs,
Esther, and Ezekiel.

The history of the exposition of this book is given in detail by
Christian D. Ginsburg in The Song of Songs, London 1857; and by Zckler
in "The Song," forming part of Lange's Bibelwerk, 1868, and supplemented
by an account of the English interpretations and translations in the
Anglo-American translation of this work by Green. Zunz, in the preface
to Rebenstein's (Bernstein's) Lied der Lieder, 1834, has given an
historical account of the Jewish expositors. Steinschneider's המזכיר
(Heb. Bibliograph. 1869, p. 110ff.) presents a yet fuller account of the
Jewish commentaries. The Mnich royal library contains a considerable
number of these, - e.g., by Moses b. Tibbon, Shemariah, Immanuel Romi,
Moses Calais (who embraced Christianity). Our commentary presents
various new contributions to the history of the interpretation of this
book. No other book of Scripture has been so much abused, by an
unscientific spiritualizing, and an over-scientific unspiritual
treatment, as this has. Luther says, at the close of his exposition:
Quodsi erro, veniam meretur primus labor, nam aliorum cogitationes longe
plus absurditatis habent. To inventory the maculatur of these
absurdities is a repulsive undertaking, and, in the main, a useless
labour, from which we absolve ourselves.
