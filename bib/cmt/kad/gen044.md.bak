### [Genesis Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 44:1</span></span>

The Test. - After the dinner Joseph had his brothers' sacks filled by
his steward with corn, as much as they could hold, and every one's money
placed inside; and in addition to that, had his own silver goblet put
into Benjamin's sack.

[Genesis 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 44:3</span></span>

Then as soon as it was light (אור, 3rd pers. perf. in o: Ges. 72, 1),
they were sent away with their asses. But they were hardly outside the
town, "not far off," when he directed his steward to follow the men, and
as soon as he overtook them, to say, "Wherefore have ye rewarded evil
for good? Is it not this from which my lord drinketh, and he is
accustomed to prophesy from it? Ye have done an evil deed!" By these
words they were accused of theft; the thing was taken for granted as
well known to them all, and the goblet purloined was simply described as
a very valuable possession of Joseph's. נחשׁ: lit., to whisper, to
mumble out formularies, incantations, then to prophesy, divinare.
According to this, the Egyptians at that time practised λεκανοσκοπίη or
λεκανομαντεία and ὑδρομαντεία, the plate and water incantations, of
which Jamblichus speaks (de myst. iii. 14), and which consisted in
pouring clean water into a goblet, and then looking into the water for
representations of future events; or in pouring water into a goblet or
dish, dropping in pieces of gold and silver, also precious stones, and
then observing and interpreting the appearances in the water (cf. Varro
apud August. civ. Dei 7, 35; Plin. h. n. 37, 73; Strabo, xvi. p. 762).
Traces of this have been continued even to our own day (see Norden's
Journey through Egypt and Nubia). But we cannot infer with certainty
from this, that Joseph actually adopted this superstitious practice. The
intention of the statement may simply have been to represent the goblet
as a sacred vessel, and Joseph as acquainted with the most secret things
([Gen 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#015).md).

[Genesis 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 44:7</span></span>

In the consciousness of their innocence the brethren repelled this
charge with indignation, and appealed to the fact that they brought back
the gold which was found in their sacks, and therefore could not
possibly have stolen gold or silver; and declared that whoever should be
found in possession of the goblet, should be put to death, and the rest
become slaves.

[Genesis 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 44:10</span></span>

The man replied, "Now let it be even (גּם placed first for the sake of
emphasis) according to your words: with whom it is found, he shall be my
slave, and ye (the rest) shall remain blameless." Thus he modified the
sentence, to assume the appearance of justice.

[Genesis 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 44:11</span></span>

They then took down their sacks as quickly as possible; and he examined
them, beginning with the eldest and finishing with the youngest; and the
goblet was found in Benjamin's sack. With anguish and alarm at this new
calamity they rent their clothes (vid., [Gen
37:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#034).md), loaded their asses again, and
returned to the city. It would now be seen how they felt in their inmost
hearts towards their father's favourite, who had been so distinguished
by the great man of Egypt: whether now as formerly they were capable of
giving up their brother, and bringing their aged father with sorrow to
the grave; or whether they were ready, with unenvying, self-sacrificing
love, to give up their own liberty and lives for him. And they stood
this test.

[Genesis 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 44:14</span></span>

Result of the Test. - [Gen 44:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#014.md).
With Judah leading the way, they came into the house to Joseph, and fell
down before him begging for mercy. Joseph spoke to them harshly: "What
kind of deed is this that ye have done? Did ye not know that such a man
as I (a man initiated into the most secret things) would certainly
divine this?" נחשׁ augurari. Judah made no attempt at a defence. "What
shall we say to my lord? how speak, how clear ourselves? God (Ha-Elohim,
the personal God) has found out the wickedness of thy servants (i.e., He
is now punishing the crime committed against our brother, cf. [Gen
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021).md). Behold, we are my lord's
slaves, both we, and he in whose hand the cup was found." But Joseph
would punish mildly and justly. The guilty one alone should be his
slave; the others might go in peace, i.e., uninjured, to their father.

[Genesis 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 44:18</span></span>

But that the brothers could not do. Judah, who had pledged himself to
his father for Benjamin, ventured in the anguish of his heart to
approach Joseph, and implore him to liberate his brother. "I would give
very much," says Luther, "to be able to pray to our Lord God as well as
Judah prays to Joseph here; for it is a perfect specimen of prayer, the
true feeling that there ought to be in prayer." Beginning with the
request for a gracious hearing, as he was speaking to the ears of one
who was equal to Pharaoh (who could condemn or pardon like the king),
Judah depicted in natural, affecting, powerful, and irresistible words
the love of their aged father to this son of his old age, and his grief
when they told him that they were not to come into the presence of the
lord of Egypt again without Benjamin; the intense anxiety with which,
after a severe struggle, their father had allowed him to come, after he
(Judah) had offered to be answerable for his life; and the grievous
fact, that if they returned without the youth, they must bring down the
grey hairs of their father with sorrow to the grave.

[Genesis 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 44:21</span></span>

To "set eyes upon him" signifies, with a gracious intention, to show him
good-will (as in [Jer 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#012.md); [Jer
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#004).md).

[Genesis 44:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 44:27</span></span>

"That my wife bore to me two (sons):" Jacob regards Rachel alone as his
actual wife (cf. [Gen 46:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#019).md).

[Genesis 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 44:28</span></span>

ואמר, preceded by a preterite, is to be rendered "and I was obliged to
say, Only (nothing but) torn in pieces has he become."

[Genesis 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 44:30</span></span>

"His soul is bound to his soul:" equivalent to, "he clings to him with
all his soul."

[Genesis 44:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 44:33</span></span>

Judah closed his appeal with the entreaty, "Now let thy servant (me)
remain instead of the lad as slave to my lord, but let the lad go up
with his brethren; for how could I go to my father without the lad being
with me! (I cannot,) that I may not see the calamity which will befall
my father!"
