### [Psalms Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 39:0</span></span>

Prayers of One Sorely Tried at the Sight of the Prosperity of the
Ungodly

In [Psa 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#014.md) the poet calls himself a
dumb person, who opens not his mouth; this submissive, resigned keeping
of silence he affirms of himself in the same words in [Psa
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#003.md) also. This forms a prominent
characteristic common to the two Psalms, which fully warranted their
being placed together as a pair. There is, however, another Psalm, which
is still more closely related to [Psa
39:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md), viz., [Psa
62:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md), which, together with [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md), has a similar historical
background. The author, in his dignity, is threatened by those who from
being false friends have become open enemies, and who revel in the
enjoyment of illegitimately acquired power and possessions. From his own
experience, in the midst of which he commits his safety and his honour
to God, he derives the general warnings, that to trust in riches is
deceptive, and that power belongs alone to God the Avenger - two
doctrines, in support of which the issue of the affair with Absalom was
a forcible example. Thus it is with [Psa
62:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md), and in like manner [Psa
39:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md) also. Both Psalms bear the
name of Jeduthun side by side with the name of David at their head; both
describe the nothingness of everything human in the same language; both
delight more than other Psalms in the use of the assuring, confident אך;
both have סלה twice; both coincide in some points with the Book of Job;
the form of both Psalms, however, is so polished, transparent, and
classic, that criticism is not authorized in assigning to this pair of
Psalms any particular poet other than David. The reason of the redacteur
not placing [Psa 62:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md) immediately
after [Psa 39:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md) is to be found in
the fact that [Psa 62:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md) is an
Elohim-Psalm, which could not stand in the midst of Jahve-Psalms.

To the inscribed למנצּח, לידיתוּן is added in this instance. The name is
also written thus in [Psa 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001.md); [Ch1
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038.md); [Neh
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017.md), and always with the Kerמ
ידוּתוּן, which, after the analogy of זבוּלוּן, is the more easily
pronouncible pointing ([Psa 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001).md). It
is an offshoot of the form ידוּת or ידית; cf. שׁבוּת and שׁבית, חפשׁוּת
and חפשׁית. It is the name of one of David's three choir-masters or
precentors - the third in conjunction with Asaph and Heman, [Ch1
16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041.md)., [Psa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md)., [Ch2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012.md); [Ch2
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015.md), and is, without doubt, the same
person as איתן, 1 Chr. 15, a name which is changed into ידותון after the
arrangement in Gibeon, 1 Chr. 16. Consequently side by side with למנצח,
לידותון will be the name of the מנצח himself, i.e., the name of the
person to whom the song was handed over to be set to music. The fact
that in two inscriptions ([Psa 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md);
[Psa 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001).md) we read על instead of the ל
of לידיתון, does not militate against this. By ל Jeduthun is denoted as
the person to whom the song was handed over for performance; and by על,
as the person to whom the performance was assigned. The rendering: "to
the director of the Jeduthunites," adopted by Hitzig, is possible
regarding the ידותון as used as a generic name like אהרן in [Ch1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#027.md); [Ch1
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#017.md); but the customary use of the ל
in inscriptions is against it.

The Psalm consists of four stanzas without any strophic symmetry. The
first three are of only approximately the same compass, and the final
smaller stanza has designedly the character of an epilogue.

[Psalms 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 39:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 39:2-4) The poet relates how he has resolved to bear his own
affliction silently in the face of the prosperity of the ungodly, but
that his smart was so overpowering that he was compelled involuntarily
to break his silence by loud complaint. The resolve follows the
introductory אמרתּי in cohortatives. He meant to take heed to his ways,
i.e., his manner of thought and action, in all their extent, lest he
should sin with his tongue, viz., by any murmuring complaint concerning
his own misfortune, when he saw the prosperity of the ungodly. He was
resolved to keep (i.e., cause invariably to press) a bridling (cf. on
the form, [Gen 30:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#037).md), or a bridle
(capistrum), upon his mouth, so long as he should see the ungodly
continuing and sinning in the fulness of his strength, instead of his
speedy ruin which one ought to expect. Then he was struck dumb דּוּמיּה,
in silence, i.e., as in [Psa 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md), cf.
[Lam 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#026.md), in resigned submission, he
was silent מטּוב, turned away from (vid., [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md); [Sa1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#008), and frequently.md) prosperity, i.e.,
from that in which he saw the evil-doer rejoicing; he sought to silence
for ever the perplexing contradiction between this prosperity and the
righteousness of God. But this self-imposed silence gave intensity to
the repressed pain, and this was thereby נעכּר, stirred up, excited,
aroused; the inward heat became, in consequence of restrained complaint,
all the more intense ([Jer 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009).md): "and
while I was musing a fire was kindled," i.e., the thoughts and emotions
rubbing against one another produced a blazing fire, viz., of
irrepressible vexation, and the end of it was: "I spake with my tongue,"
unable any longer to keep in my pain. What now follows is not what was
said by the poet when in this condition. On the contrary, he turns away
from his purpose, which has been proved to be impracticable, to God
Himself with the prayer that He would teach him calm submission.

[Psalms 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 39:4</span></span>

(Heb.: 39:5-7) He prays God to set the transitoriness of earthly life
clearly before his eyes (cf. [Psa
90:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#012).md); for if life is only a few
spans long, then even his suffering and the prosperity of the ungodly
will last only a short time. Oh that God would then grant him to know
his end ([Job 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011).md), i.e., the end of
his life, which is at the same time the end of his affliction, and the
measure of his days, how it is with this (מה, interrog. extenuantis, as
in [Psa 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005).md), in order that he may
become fully conscious of his own frailty! Hupfeld corrects the text to
אני מה־חלד, after the analogy of [Psa
89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048.md), because חדל cannot signify
"frail." But חדל signifies that which leaves off and ceases, and
consequently in this connection, finite and transitory or frail. מה,
quam, in connection with an adjective, as in [Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md); [Psa
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020.md); [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md); [Psa
66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003.md); [Psa
133:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md). By הן (the customary form of
introducing the propositio minor, [Lev
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#018.md); [Lev
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#020).md) the preceding petition is
supported. God has, indeed, made the days, i.e., the lifetime, of a man
טפחות, handbreadths, i.e., He has allotted to it only the short
extension of a few handbreadths (cf. ימים, a few days, e.g., [Isa
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020).md), of which nine make a yard (cf.
πήχυιος χρόνος in Mimnermus, and [Sa1
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#003).md); the duration of human life (on
חלד vid., [Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014).md) is as a
vanishing nothing before God the eternal One. The particle אך is
originally affirmative, and starting from that sense becomes
restrictive; just as רק is originally restrictive and then affirmative.
Sometimes also, as is commonly the case with אכן, the affirmative
signification passes over into the adversative (cf. verum, verum enim
vero). In our passage, agreeably to the restrictive sense, it is to be
explained thus: nothing but mere nothingness (cf. [Psa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014.md); [Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002).md) is every man נצּב, standing
firmly, i.e., though he stand never so firmly, though he be never so
stedfast ([Zac 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#016).md). Here the music
rises to tones of bitter lament, and the song continues in [Psa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md) with the same theme. צלם,
belonging to the same root as צל, signifies a shadow-outline, an image;
the בּ is, as in [Psa 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002.md), Beth
essentiae: he walks about consisting only of an unsubstantial shadow.
Only הבל, breath-like, or after the manner of breath ([Psa
144:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#004).md), from empty, vain motives and
with vain results, do they make a disturbance (pausal fut. energicum, as
in [Psa 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008).md); and he who restlessly
and noisily exerts himself knows not who will suddenly snatch together,
i.e., take altogether greedily to himself, the many things that he heaps
up (צבר, as in [Job 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016).md); cf. [Isa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004.md), and on - ām = αὐτά, [Lev
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#010.md) (in connection with which אלה
הדברים, cf. [Isa 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#016.md), is in the mind
of the speaker).

[Psalms 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 39:7</span></span>

(Heb.: 39:8-12) It is customary to begin a distinct turning-point of a
discourse with ועתּה: and now, i.e., in connection with this nothingness
of vanity of a life which is so full of suffering and unrest, what am I
to hope, quid sperem (concerning the perfect, vid., on [Psa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003).md)? The answer to this question
which he himself throws out is, that Jahve is the goal of his waiting or
hoping. It might appear strange that the poet is willing to make the
brevity of human life a reason for being calm, and a ground of comfort.
But here we have the explanation. Although not expressly assured of a
future life of blessedness, his faith, even in the midst of death, lays
hold on Jahve as the Living One and as the God of the living. It is just
this which is so heroic in the Old Testament faith, that in the midst of
the riddles of the present, and in the face of the future which is lost
in dismal night, it casts itself unreservedly into the arms of God.
While, however, sin is the root of all evil, the poet prays in [Psa
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009.md) before all else, that God would
remove from him all the transgressions by which he has fully incurred
his affliction; and while, given over to the consequences of his sin, he
would become, not only to his own dishonour but also to the dishonour of
God, a derision to the unbelieving, he prays in [Psa
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009.md) that God would not permit it to
come to this. כּל, [Psa 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009.md), has
Mercha, and is consequently, as in [Psa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010), to be read with (not ŏ.md), since
an accent can never be placed by Kametz chatûph. Concerning נבל, [Psa
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009.md), see on [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md). As to the rest he is silent and
calm; for God is the author, viz., of his affliction (עשׂה, used just as
absolutely as in Ps 22:32; [Psa 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005.md);
52:11, [Lam 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#021).md). Without ceasing
still to regard intently the prosperity of the ungodly, he recognises
the hand of God in his affliction, and knows that he has not merited
anything better. But it is permitted to him to pray that God would
suffer mercy to take the place of right. נגעך is the name he gives to
his affliction, as in [Psa 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#012.md), as
being a stroke (blow) of divine wrath; תּגרת ידך, as a quarrel into
which God's hand has fallen with him; and by אני, with the almighty
(punishing) hand of God, he contrasts himself the feeble one, to whom,
if the present state of things continues, ruin is certain. In [Psa
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#012.md) he puts his own personal
experience into the form of a general maxim: when with rebukes (תּוכחות
from תּוכחת, collateral form with תּוכחה, תּוכחות) Thou chastenest a man
on account of iniquity (perf. conditionale), Thou makest his
pleasantness ([Isa 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003).md), i.e., his
bodily beauty ([Job 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#021).md), to melt
away, moulder away (ותּמס, fut. apoc. from המסה to cause to melt, [Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007).md), like the moth ([Hos
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#012).md), so that it falls away, as a
moth-eaten garment falls into rags. Thus do all men become mere nothing.
They are sinful and perishing. The thought expressed in [Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006.md) is here repeated as a refrain.
The music again strikes in here, as there.

[Psalms 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 39:12</span></span>

(Heb.: 39:13-14) Finally, the poet renews the prayer for an alleviation
of his sufferings, basing it upon the shortness of the earthly
pilgrimage. The urgent שׁמעה is here fuller toned, being שׁמעה.

(Note: So Heidenheim and Baer, following Abulwald, Efodi, and Mose
ha-Nakdan. The Masoretic observation לית קמץ חטף, "only here with
Kametzchateph," is found appended in codices. This Chatephkametz is
euphonic, as in לקחה, [Gen 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023.md), and
in many other instances that are obliterated in our editions, vid.,
Abulwald, חרקמה ס, p. 198, where even מטּהרו = מטּהרו, [Psa
89:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#045.md), is cited among these examples
(Ges. 10, 2 rem.).)

Side by side with the language of prayer, tears even appear here as
prayer that is intelligible to God; for when the gates of prayer seem to
be closed, the gates of tears still remain unclosed (שׁערי דמעות לא
ננעלו), B. Berachoth 32b. As a reason for his being heard, David appeals
to the instability and finite character of this earthly life in language
which we also hear from his own lips in [Ch1
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015.md). גּר is the stranger who travels
about and sojourns as a guest in a country that is not his native land;
תּושׁב is a sojourner, or one enjoying the protection of the laws, who,
without possessing any hereditary title, has settled down there, and to
whom a settlement is allotted by sufferance. The earth is God's; that
which may be said of the Holy Land ([Lev
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023).md) may be said of the whole earth;
man has no right upon it, he only remains there so long as God permits
him. כּכל־אבותי glances back even to the patriarchs ([Gen
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009.md), cf. [Psa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004).md). Israel is, it is true, at the
present time in possession of a fixed dwelling-place, but only as the
gift of his God, and for each individual it is only during his life,
which is but a handbreadth long. May Jahve, then - so David prays - turn
away His look of wrath from him, in order that he may shine forth,
become cheerful or clear up, before he goes hence and it is too late.
השׁע is imper. apoc. Hiph. for השׁעה (in the signification of Kal), and
ought, according to the form הרב, properly to be השׁע; it is, however,
pointed just like the imper. Hiph. of שׁעע in [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md), without any necessity for
explaining it as meaning obline (oculos tuos) = connive (Abulwald),
which would be an expression unworthy of God. It is on the contrary to
be rendered: look away from me; on which compare [Job
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019.md); [Job
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006.md); on אבליגה cf. ib. [Job
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020.md); [Job
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#027.md); on אלך בּטרם, ib.[Job
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md); on ואיננּי, ib. [Job
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#008.md), [Job
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021.md). The close of the Psalm,
consequently, is re-echoed in many ways in the Book of Job The Book of
Job is occupied with the same riddle as that with which this Psalm is
occupied. But in the solution of it, it advances a step further. David
does not know how to disassociate in his mind sin and suffering, and
wrath and suffering. The Book of Job, on the contrary, thinks of
suffering and love together; and in the truth that suffering also, even
though it be unto death, must serve the highest interests of those who
love God, it possesses a satisfactory solution.
