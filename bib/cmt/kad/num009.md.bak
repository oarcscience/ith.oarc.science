### [Numbers Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 9:1</span></span>

The Passover at Sinai, and Instructions for a Supplementary Passover. -
[Num 9:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001.md). On the first institution
of the Passover, before the exodus from Egypt, God had appointed the
observance of this feast as an everlasting statute for all future
generations ([Exo 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#013.md), [Exo
12:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#024).md). In the first month of the
second year after the exodus, that is to say, immediately after the
erection of the tabernacle ([Exo 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002.md),
[Exo 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017).md), this command was renewed,
and the people were commanded "to keep the Passover in its appointed
season, according to all its statutes and rights;" not to postpone it,
that is, according to an interpretation that might possibly have been
put upon [Exo 12:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#024.md), until they
came to Canaan, but to keep it there at Sinai. And Israel kept it in the
wilderness of Sinai, in exact accordance with the commands which God had
given before (Ex 12). There is no express command, it is true, that the
blood of the paschal lambs, instead of being smeared upon the lintel and
posts of the house-doors (or the entrances to the tents), was to be
sprinkled upon the altar of burnt-offering; nor is it recorded that this
was actually done; but it followed of itself from the altered
circumstances, inasmuch as there was not destroying angel to pass
through the camp at Sinai and smite the enemies of Israel, whilst there
was an altar in existence now upon which all the sacrificial blood was
to be poured out, and therefore the blood of the paschal sacrifice also.

(Note: If we take into consideration still further, the fact that the
law had already been issued that the blood of all the animals slain for
food, whether inside or outside the camp, was to be sprinkled upon the
altar ([Lev 17:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003).md), there can be no
doubt that the blood of the paschal lambs would also have to be
sprinkled upon the altar, notwithstanding the difficulties referred to
by Kurtz, arising from the small number of priests to perform the task,
viz., Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar, as Nadab and Abihu were now dead. But
(1) Kurtz estimates the number of paschal lambs much too high, viz., at
100,000 to 140,000; for when he reckons the whole number of the people
at about two millions, and gives one lamb upon an average to every
fifteen or twenty persons, he includes infants and sucklings among those
who partook of the Passover. But as there were only 603,550 males of
twenty years old and upwards in the twelve tribes, we cannot reckon more
than about 700,000 males as participants in the paschal meal, since the
children under ten or twelve years of age would not come into the
calculation, even if those who were between eight and twelve partook of
the meal, since there would be many adults who could not eat the
Passover, because they were unclean. Now if, as Josephus affirms (de
bell. jud. vi. 9, 3), there were never less than ten, and often as many
as twenty, who joined together in the time of Christ (οὐκ ἔλασσον ἀνδρῶν
δέκα...πολλοί δέ καὶ σὺν εἴκοσιν ἀθροίζονται), we need not assume that
there were more than 50,000 lambs required for the feast of Passover at
Sinai; because even if all the women who were clean took part in the
feast, they would confine themselves as much as possible to the quantity
actually needed, and one whole sheep of a year old would furnish flesh
enough for one supper for fifteen males and fifteen females. (2) The
slaughtering of all these lambs need not have taken place in the narrow
space afforded by the court, even if it was afterwards performed in the
more roomy courts of the later temple, as has been inferred from [Ch2
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#016.md) and [Ch2
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#011.md). Lastly, the sprinkling of the
blood was no doubt the business of the priests. But the Levites assisted
them, so that they sprinkled the blood upon the altar "out of the hand
of the Levites" ([Ch2 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#016).md).
Moreover, we are by no means in a condition to pronounce positively
whether three priests were sufficient or not at Sinai, because we have
no precise information respecting the course pursued. The altar, no
doubt, would appear too small for the performance of the whole within
the short time of hardly three hours (from the ninth hour of the day to
the eleventh). But if it was possible, in the time of the Emperor Nero,
to sprinkle the blood of 256,500 paschal lambs (for that number was
actually counted under Cestius; see Josephus, l. c.) upon the altar of
the temple of that time, which was six, or eight, or even ten times
larger, it must have been also possible, in Moses' time, for the blood
of 50,000 lambs to be sprinkled upon the altar of the tabernacle, which
was five cubits in length, and the same in breadth.)

[Numbers 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 9:6</span></span>

There were certain men who were defiled by human corpses (see [Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028).md), and could not eat the Passover
on the day appointed. These men came to Moses, and asked, "Why are we
diminished (prevented) from offering the sacrificial gift of Jehovah at
its season in the midst of the children of Israel (i.e., in common with
the rest of the Israelites)?" The exclusion of persons defiled from
offering the Passover followed from the law, that only clean persons
were to participate in a sacrificial meal ([Lev
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021).md), and that no one could offer any
sacrifice in an unclean state.

[Numbers 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 9:8</span></span>

Moses told them to wait (stand), and he would hear what the Lord, of
whom he would inquire, would command.

[Numbers 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 9:9</span></span>

Jehovah gave these general instructions: "Every one who is defiled by a
corpse or upon a distant

(Note: The רחקה is marked as suspicious by puncta extraordinaria,
probably first of all simply on the ground that the more exact
definition is not found in [Num 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#013.md).
The Rabbins suppose the marks to indicate that rechokah is not to be
taken here in its literal sense, but denotes merely distance from
Jerusalem, or from the threshold of the outer court of the temple. See
Mishnah Pesach ix. 2, with the commentaries of Bartenora and Maimonides,
and the conjectures of the Pesikta on the ten passages in the Pentateuch
with punctis extraordinariis, in Drusii notae uberiores ad h. v.)

journey, of you and your future families, shall keep the Passover in the
second month on the fourteenth, between the two evenings," and that in
all respects according to the statute of this feast, the three leading
points of which - viz., eating the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter
herbs, leaving nothing till the next day, and not breaking a bone ([Exo
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#008.md), [Exo
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#010.md), [Exo
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#046).md), - are repeated here. But lest
any one should pervert this permission, to celebrate the Passover a
month later in case of insuperable difficulties, which had only been
given for the purpose of enforcing the obligation to keep the covenant
meal upon every member of the nation, into an excuse for postponing it
without any necessity and merely from indifference, on the ground that
he could make it up afterwards, the threat is held out in [Num
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#013.md), that whoever should omit to keep
the feast at the legal time, if he was neither unclean nor upon a
journey, should be cut off; and in [Num
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#014.md) the command is repeated with
reference to foreigners, that they were also to keep the law and
ordinance with the greatest minuteness when they observed the Passover:
cf. [Exo 12:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#048.md), according to which
the stranger was required first of all to let himself be circumcised. In
[Num 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#014.md), יהיה stands for תּהיה, as
in [Exo 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#049.md); cf. Ewald, 295, d.
ו...ו et...et, both...and.

[Numbers 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 9:15</span></span>

[Num 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015.md)

Signs for Removing and Encamping. - On their way through the desert from
the border of Egypt to Sinai, Jehovah Himself had undertaken to guide
His people by a cloud, as the visible sign and vehicle of His gracious
presence ([Exo 13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021).md). This cloud
had come down upon the dwelling when the tabernacle was erected, whilst
the glory of the Lord filled the holy of holies ([Exo
40:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034).md). In [Num
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015.md) the historian refers to this
fact, and then describes more fully what had been already briefly
alluded to in [Exo 40:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#036.md), namely,
that when the cloud rose up from the dwelling of the tabernacle it was a
sign for removing, and when it came down upon the dwelling, a sign for
encamping. In [Num 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015.md), "on the day
of the setting up of the dwelling," [Exo
40:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md), is resumed; and in [Num
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015.md) the appearance of the cloud
during the night, from evening till morning, is described in accordance
with [Exo 40:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#038.md). (On the fact itself,
see the exposition of [Exo 13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021).md).
העדת לאהל משׁכּן, "the dwelling of the tent of witness" (ל used for the
genitive to avoid a double construct state: Ewald, 292, a). In the place
of ohel mod, "tent of the meeting of Jehovah with His people," we have
here "tent of witness" (or "testimony"), i.e., of the tables with the
decalogue which were laid up in the ark of the covenant ([Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016).md), because the decalogue formed
the basis of the covenant of Jehovah with Israel, and the pledge of the
gracious presence of the Lord in the tabernacle. In the place of
"dwellings of the tent of witness," we have "dwelling of witness"
(testimony) in [Num 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011.md), and "tent
of witness" in [Num 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#002.md); [Num
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008.md), to denote the whole dwelling, as
divided into the holy place and the holy of holies, and not the holy of
holies alone. This is unmistakeably evident from a comparison of the
verse before us with [Exo 40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md),
according to which the cloud covered not merely one portion of the
tabernacle, but the whole of the tent of meeting (ohel mod). The
rendering, "the cloud covered the dwelling at the tent of witness,"
i.e., at that part of it in which the witness (or "testimony") was kept,
viz., the holy of holies, which Rosenmller and Knobel adopt, cannot be
sustained, inasmuch as ל has no such meaning, but simply conveys the
idea of motion and passage into a place or condition (cf. Ewald, 217,
d); and the dwelling or tabernacle was not first made into the tent of
witness through the cloud which covered it.

[Num 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#016.md)

The covering of the dwelling, with the cloud which shone by night as a
fiery look, was constant, and not merely a phenomenon which appeared
when the tabernacle was first erected, and then vanished away again.

[Num 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#017.md)

"In accordance with the rising of the cloud from the tent, then
afterwards the children of Israel broke up," i.e., whenever the cloud
ascended up from the tent, they always broke up immediately afterwards;
"and at the place where the cloud came down, there they encamped." The
שׁכן, or settling down of the cloud, sc., upon the tabernacle, we can
only understand in the following manner, as the tabernacle was all taken
to pieces during the march: viz., that the cloud visibly descended from
the height at which it ordinarily soared above the ark of the covenant,
as it was carried in front of the army, for a signal that the tabernacle
was to be set up there; and then this had been done, it settled down
upon it.

[Num 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#018.md)

As Jehovah was with His people in the cloud, the rising and falling of
the cloud was "the command of the Lord" to the Israelites to break up or
to pitch the camp. As long, therefore, as the cloud rested upon the
dwelling, i.e., remained stationary, they continued their encampment.

[Num 9:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#019.md)

Whether it might rest many days long (האריך, to lengthen out the
resting), or only a few days ([Gen
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030).md), or only from evening till
morning, and then rise up again in the morning, or for a day and a
night, or for two days, or for a month, or for days (yamim), i.e., a
space of time not precisely determined (cf. [Gen
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#003.md); [Gen
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#004).md), they encamped without
departing. "Kept the charge of the Lord" ([Num
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#019.md) and [Num
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#023).md), i.e., observed what was to be
observed towards Jehovah (see [Lev
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035).md). With אשׁר וישׁ, "was it that,"
or "did it happen that," two other possible cases are introduced. After
[Num 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#020.md), the apodosis, "they kept
the charge of the Lord," is to be repeated in thought from [Num
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#019.md). The elaboration of the account
([Num 9:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015).md), which abounds with
repetitions, is intended to bring out the importance of the fact, and to
awaken the consciousness not only of the absolute dependence of Israel
upon the guidance of Jehovah, but also of the gracious care of their
God, which was thereby displayed to the Israelites throughout all their
journeyings.
