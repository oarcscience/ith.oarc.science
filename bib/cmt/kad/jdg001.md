### [Judges Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

I. Attitude of Israel Towards the Canaanites, and Towards Jehovah Its
God - Judges 1-3:6

Hostilities between Israel and the Canaanites after Joshua's Death -
Judges 1:1-2:5

After the death of Joshua the tribes of Israel resolved to continue the
war with the Canaanites, that they might exterminate them altogether
from the land that had been given them for an inheritance. In accordance
with the divine command, Judah commenced the strife in association with
Simeon, smote the king of Bezek, conquered Jerusalem, Hebron and Debir
upon the mountains, Zephath in the south land, and three of the chief
cities of the Philistines, and took possession of the mountains; but was
unable to exterminate the inhabitants of the plain, just as the
Benjaminites were unable to drive the Jebusites out of Jerusalem (vv.
1-21). The tribe of Joseph also conquered the city of Bethel ([Jdg
1:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#022).md); but from the remaining towns
of the land neither the Manassites, nor the Ephraimites, nor the tribes
of Zebulun, Asher, and Naphtali expelled the Canaanites: all that they
did was to make them tributary ([Jdg
1:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027).md). The Danites were actually
forced back by the Amorites out of the plain into the mountains, because
the latter maintained their hold of the towns of the plain, although the
house of Joseph conquered them and made them tributary ([Jdg
1:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034).md). The angel of the Lord
therefore appeared at Bochim, and declared to the Israelites, that
because they had not obeyed the command of the Lord, to make no covenant
with the Canaanites, the Lord would no more drive out these nations, but
would cause them and their gods to become a snare to them ([Jdg
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001).md). From this divine revelation it
is evident, on the one hand, that the failure to exterminate the
Canaanites had its roots in the negligence of the tribes of Israel; and
on the other hand, that the accounts of the wars of the different
tribes, and the enumeration of the towns in the different possessions
out of which the Canaanites were not expelled, were designed to show
clearly the attitude of the Israelites to the Canaanites in the age
immediately following the death of Joshua, or to depict the historical
basis on which the development of Israel rested in the era of the
judges.

[Judges 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 1:1</span></span>

With the words "Now, after the death of Joshua, it came to pass," the
book of Judges takes up the thread of the history where the book of
Joshua had dropped it, to relate the further development of the covenant
nation. A short time before his death, Joshua had gathered the elders
and heads of the people around him, and set before them the entire
destruction of the Canaanites through the omnipotent help of the Lord,
if they would only adhere with fidelity to the Lord; whilst, at the same
time, he also pointed out to them the dangers of apostasy from the Lord
(Josh 23). Remembering this admonition and warning, the Israelites
inquired, after Joshua's death, who should begin the war against the
Canaanites who still remained to be destroyed; and the Lord answered,
"Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand"
([Jdg 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md), [Jdg
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002).md). בּיהוה שׁאל, to ask with Jehovah
for the purpose of obtaining a declaration of the divine will, is
substantially the same as האוּרים בּמשׁפּט שׁאל ([Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021).md), to inquire the will of the
Lord through the Urim and Thummim of the high priest. From this time
forward inquiring of the Lord occurs with greater frequency (vid., [Jdg
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#023.md), [Jdg
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#027.md); [Sa1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#022.md); [Sa1
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#010.md); [Sa1
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#002), etc..md), as well as the synonymous
expression "ask of Elohim" in [Jdg
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#005.md); [Jdg
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018.md); [Sa1
14:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#037.md); [Sa1
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#013.md); [Ch1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#010.md); whereas Moses and Joshua
received direct revelations from God. The phrase אל־הכּנעני יעלה, "go up
to the Canaanites," is defined more precisely by the following words,
"to fight against them;" so that עלה is used here also to denote the
campaign against a nation (see at [Jos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001).md), without there being any
necessity, however, for us to take אל in the sense of על. בתּחלּה עלה
signifies "to go up in the beginning," i.e., to open or commence the
war; not to hold the commandership in the war, as the Sept., Vulgate,
and others render it (see [Jdg 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#018.md),
where להלּחם יחל is expressly distinguished from being the chief or
leader). Moreover, מי does not mean who? i.e., what person, but, as the
answer clearly shows, what tribe? Now a tribe could open the war, and
take the lead at the head of the other tribes, but could not be the
commander-in-chief. In the present instance, however, Judah did not even
enter upon the war at the head of all the tribes, but simply joined with
the tribe of Simeon to make a common attack upon the Canaanites in their
inheritance. The promise in [Jdg 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002.md)
is the same as that in [Jos 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#002.md); [Jos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md), etc. "The land" is not merely the
land allotted to the tribe of Judah, or Judah's inheritance, as Bertheau
supposes, for Judah conquered Jerusalem ([Jdg
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008).md), which had been allotted to the
tribe of Benjamin ([Jos 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028).md), but
the land of Canaan generally, so far as it was still in the possession
of the Canaanites and was to be conquered by Judah. The reason why Judah
was to commence the hostilities is not to be sought for in the fact that
Judah was the most numerous of all the tribes (Rosenmller), but rather
in the fact that Judah had already been appointed by the blessing of
Jacob ([Gen 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008)..md) to be the champion
of his brethren.

[Judges 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 1:3</span></span>

Judah invited Simeon his brother, i.e., their brother tribe, to take
part in the contest. The epithet is applied to Simeon, not because
Simeon and Judah, the sons of Jacob, were the children of the same
mother, Leah ([Gen 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#033.md), [Gen
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#035).md), but because Simeon's
inheritance was within the territory of Judah ([Jos
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001)..md), so that Simeon was more
closely connected with Judah than any of the other tribes. "Come up with
me into my lot (into the inheritance that has fallen to me by lot), that
we may fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee
into thy lot. So Simeon went with him," i.e., joined with Judah in
making war upon the Canaanites. This request shows that Judah's
principal intention was to make war upon and exterminate the Canaanites
who remained in his own and Simeon's inheritance. The different
expressions employed, come up and go, are to be explained from the
simple fact that the whole of Simeon's territory was in the shephelah
and Negeb, whereas Judah had received the heart of his possessions upon
the mountains.

[Judges 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 1:4</span></span>

"And Judah went up," sc., against the Canaanites, to make war upon them.

The completion of the sentence is supplied by the context, more
especially by [Jdg 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002.md). So far as the
sense is concerned, Rosenmller has given the correct explanation of
ויּעל, "Judah entered upon the expedition along with Simeon." "And they
smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites in Bezek, 10,000 men." The
result of the war is summed up briefly in these words; and then in [Jdg
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#005.md) the capture and punishment of
the hostile king Adoni-bezek is specially mentioned as being the most
important event in the war. The foe is described as consisting of
Canaanites and Perizzites, two tribes which have been already named in
[Gen 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007.md) and [Gen
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030.md) as representing the entire
population of Canaan, "the Canaanites" comprising principally those in
the lowlands by the Jordan and the Mediterranean (vid., [Num
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029.md); [Jos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003).md), and "the Perizzites" the tribes
who dwelt in the mountains ([Jos
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015).md). On the Perizzites, see [Gen
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007.md). The place mentioned, Bezek, is
only mentioned once more, namely in [Sa1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#008.md), where it is described as being
situated between Gibeah of Saul (see at [Jos
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028).md) and Jabesh in Gilead. According
to the Onom. (s. v. Bezek), there were at that time two places very near
together both named Bezek, seventeen Roman miles from Neapolis on the
road to Scythopolis, i.e., about seven hours to the north of Nabulus on
the road to Beisan. This description is perfectly reconcilable with [Sa1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#008.md). On the other hand, Clericus (ad
h. l.), Rosenmller, and v. Raumer suppose the Bezek mentioned here to
have been situated in the territory of Judah; though this cannot be
proved, since it is merely based upon an inference drawn from [Jdg
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003.md), viz., that Judah and Simeon
simply attacked the Canaanites in their own allotted territories-an
assumption which is very uncertain. There is no necessity, however, to
adopt the opposite and erroneous opinion of Bertheau, that the tribes of
Judah and Simeon commenced their expedition to the south from the
gathering-place of the united tribes at Shechem, and fought the battle
with the Canaanitish forces in that region upon this expedition; since
Shechem is not described in Josha as the gathering-place of the united
tribes, i.e., of the whole of the military force of Israel, and the
battle fought with Adoni-bezek did not take place at the time when the
tribes prepared to leave Shiloh and march to their own possessions after
the casting of the lots was over. The simplest explanation is, that when
the tribes of Judah and Simeon prepared to make war upon the Canaanites
in the possessions allotted to them, they were threatened or attacked by
the forces of the Canaanites collected together by Adoni-bezek, so that
they had first of all to turn their arms against this king before they
could attack the Canaanites in their own tribe-land. As the precise
circumstances connected with the occasion and course of this war have
not been recorded, there is nothing to hinder the supposition that
Adoni-bezek may have marched from the north against the possession of
Benjamin and Judah, possibly with the intention of joining the
Canaanites in Jebus, and the Anakim in Hebron and upon the mountains in
the south, and then making a combined attack upon the Israelites. This
might induce or even compel Judah and Simeon to attack this enemy first
of all, and even to pursue him till they overtook him at his capital
Bezek, and smote him with all his army. Adoni-bezek, i.e., lord of
Bezek, is the official title of this king, whose proper name is unknown.

In the principal engagement, in which 10,000 Canaanites fell,
Adoni-bezek escaped; but he was overtaken in his flight ([Jdg
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#006.md), [Jdg
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007).md), and so mutilated, by the cutting
off of his thumbs and great toes, that he could neither carry arms nor
flee. With this cruel treatment, which the Athenians are said to have
practised upon the capture Aegynetes (Aelian, var. hist. ii. 9), the
Israelites simply executed the just judgment of retribution, as
Adoni-bezek was compelled to acknowledge, for the cruelties which he had
inflicted upon captives taken by himself. "Seventy kings," he says in
[Jdg 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007.md), "with the thumbs of their
hands and feet cut off, were gathering under my table. As I have done,
so God hath requited me." מקצּצים ... בּהנות, lit. "cut in the thumbs of
their hands and feet" (see Ewald, Lehrb. 284 c.). The object to מלקּטים,
"gathering up" (viz., crumbs), is easily supplied from the idea of the
verb itself. Gathering up crumbs under the table, like the dogs in [Mat
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#027.md), is a figurative representation
of the most shameful treatment and humiliation. "Seventy" is a round
number, and is certainly an exaggerated hyperbole here. For even if
every town of importance in Canaan had its own king, the fact that, when
Joshua conquered the land, he only smote thirty-one kings, is sufficient
evidence that there can hardly have been seventy kings to be found in
all Canaan. It appears strange, too, that the king of Bezek is not
mentioned in connection with the conquest of Canaan under Joshua. Bezek
was probably situated more on the side towards the valley of the Jordan,
where the Israelites under Joshua did not go. Possibly, too, the
culminating point of Adoni-bezek's power, when he conquered so many
kings, was before the arrival of the Israelites in Canaan, and it may at
that time have begun to decline; so that he did not venture to undertake
anything against the combined forces of Israel under Joshua, and it was
not till the Israelitish tribes separated to go to their own
possessions, that he once more tried the fortunes of war and was
defeated. The children of Judah took him with them to Jerusalem, where
he died.

[Judges 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 1:8</span></span>

After his defeat, Judah and Simeon went against Jerusalem, and conquered
this city and smote it, i.e., its inhabitants, with the edge of the
sword, or without quarter (see [Gen
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#026).md), and set the city on fire.
בּאשׁ שׁלּח, to set on fire, to give up to the flames, only occurs again
in [Jdg 20:48](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#048.md); [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md), and [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md). Joshua had already slain the
king of Jerusalem and his four allies after the battle at Gibeon ([Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md), [Jos
10:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#018).md), but had not conquered
Jerusalem, his capital. This was not done till after Joshua's death,
when it was taken by the tribes of Judah and Simeon. But even after this
capture, and notwithstanding the fact that it had been set on fire, it
did not come into the sole and permanent possession of the Israelites.
After the conquerors had advanced still farther, to make war upon the
Canaanites in the mountains, in the Negeb, and in the shephelah (vv.
9ff.), the Jebusites took it again and rebuilt it, so that in the
following age it was regarded by the Israelites as a foreign city ([Jdg
19:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#011).md). The Benjaminites, to whom
Jerusalem had fallen by lot, were no more able to drive out the
Jebusites than the Judaeans had been. Consequently they continued to
live by the side of the Benjaminites ([Jdg
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#021).md) and the Judaeans ([Jos
15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063).md), who settled, as time rolled
on, in this the border city of their possessions; and in the upper town
especially, upon the top of Mount Zion, they established themselves so
firmly, that they could not be dislodged until David succeeded in
wresting this fortress from them, and make the city of Zion the capital
of his kingdom ([Sa2 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006)..md).

(Note: In this way we may reconcile in a very simple manner the
different accounts concerning Jerusalem in [Jos
15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063.md); [Jdg
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008.md), [Jdg
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#021.md); [Jdg
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#011.md)., [Sa1
17:54](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#054.md), and 2 Sam 5-6, without there
being the slightest necessity to restrict the conquest mentioned in this
verse to the city that was built round Mount Zion, as Josephus does, to
the exclusion of the citadel upon Zion itself; or to follow Bertheau,
and refer the account of the Jebusites dwelling by the children of Judah
in Jerusalem ([Jos 15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063).md) to a time
subsequent to the conquest of the citadel of Zion by David-an
interpretation which is neither favoured by the circumstance that the
Jebusite Araunah still held some property there in the time of David
([Sa2 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#021)..md), nor by the passage in
[Kg1 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020.md)., according to which the
descendants of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and
Jebusites who still remained in the land were made into tributary
bondmen by Solomon, and set to work upon the buildings that he had in
hand.)

[Jdg 1:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#009.md)

After the conquest of Jerusalem, the children of Judah (together with
the Simeonites, [Jdg 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003).md) went down to
their own possessions, to make war upon the Canaanites in the mountains,
the Negeb, and the shephelah (see at [Jos
15:48](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048.md); [Jos
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#033).md), and to exterminate them. They
first of all conquered Hebron and Debir upon the mountains ([Jdg
1:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#010).md), as has already been related
in [Jos 15:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014.md) (see the commentary
on this passage). The forms עלּית and תּחתּית ([Jdg
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#015).md), instead of עלּיּות and
תּחתּיּות ([Jos 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#019).md), are in the
singular, and are construed with the plural form of the feminine גּלּות,
because this is used in the sense of the singular, "a spring" (see
Ewald, 318, a.).

[Judges 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 1:16</span></span>

The notice respecting the Kenites, that they went up out of the
palm-city with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah in the
south of Arad, and dwelt there with the Judaeans, is introduced here
into the account of the wars of the tribe of Judah, because this
migration of the Kenites belonged to the time between the conquest of
Debir ([Jdg 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#012)..md) and Zephath ([Jdg
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017).md); and the notice itself was of
importance, as forming the intermediate link between [Num
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md)., and the later allusions to the
Kenites in [Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md); [Jdg
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024.md); [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md); [Sa1
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010.md); [Sa1
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#029.md). "The children of the Kenite,"
i.e., the descendants of Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses (compare
[Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md), where the name is given,
but קין occurs instead of קיני, with [Num
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029).md), were probably a branch of the
Kenites mentioned in [Gen 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019.md) along
with the other tribes of Canaan, which had separated from the other
members of its own tribe before the time of Moses and removed to the
land of Midian, where Moses met with a hospitable reception from their
chief Reguel on his flight from Egypt. These Kenites had accompanied the
Israelites to Canaan at the request of Moses ([Num
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029)..md); and when the Israelites
advanced into Canaan itself, they had probably remained as nomads in the
neighbourhood of the Jordan near to Jericho, without taking any part in
the wars of Joshua. But when the tribe of Judah had exterminated the
Canaanites out of Hebron, Debir, and the neighbourhood, after the death
of Joshua, they went into the desert of Judah with the Judaeans as they
moved farther towards the south; and going to the south-western edge of
this desert, to the district on the south of Arad (Tell Arad, see at
[Num 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001).md), they settled there on the
border of the steppes of the Negeb ([Num
33:40](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#040).md). "The palm-city" was a name
given to the city of Jericho, according to [Jdg
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md); [Deu
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#003.md); [Ch2
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015.md). There is no ground whatever for
thinking of some other town of this name in the desert of Arabia, near
the palm-forest, φοινικών, of Diod. Sic. (iii. 42) and Strabo (p. 776),
as Clericus and Bertheau suppose, even if it could be proved that there
was any such town in the neighbourhood. ויּלך, "then he went (the branch
of the Kenites just referred to) and dwelt with the people" (of the
children of Judah), that is to say, with the people of Israel in the
desert of Judah. The subject to ויּלך is קיני, the Kenite, as a tribe.

[Judges 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 1:17</span></span>

Remaining Conquests of the Combined Tribes of Judah and Simeon. - [Jdg
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017.md).

Zephath was in the territory of Simeon. This is evident not only from
the fact that Hormah (Zephath) had been allotted to the tribe of Simeon
(compare [Jos 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#004.md) with [Jos
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#030).md), but also from the words,
"Judah went with Simeon his brother," which point back to [Jdg
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003.md), and express the thought that
Judah went with Simeon into his territory to drive out the Canaanites
who were still to be found there. Going southwards from Debir, Judah and
Simeon smote the Canaanites at Zephath on the southern boundary of
Canaan, and executed the ban upon this town, from which it received the
name of Hormah, i.e., banning. The town has been preserved in the ruins
of Septa, on the south of Khalasa or Elusa (see at [Jos
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#014).md). In the passage mentioned, the
king of Hormah or Zephath is named among the kings who were slain by
Joshua. It does not follow from this, however, that Joshua must
necessarily have conquered his capital Zephath; the king of Jerusalem
was also smitten by Joshua and slain, without Jerusalem itself being
taken at that time. But even if Zephath were taken by the Israelites, as
soon as the Israelitish army had withdrawn, the Canaanites there might
have taken possession of the town again; so that, like many other
Canaanitish towns, it had to be conquered again after Joshua's death
(see the commentary on [Num 21:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#002).md).
There is not much probability in this conjecture, however, for the
simple reason that the ban pronounced by Moses upon the country of the
king of Arad ([Num 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#002).md) was carried
out now for the first time by Judah and Simeon upon the town of Zephath,
which formed a part of it. If Joshua had conquered it, he would
certainly have executed the ban upon it. The name Hormah, which was
already given to Zephath in [Jos 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#030.md)
and [Jos 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#004.md), is no proof to the
contrary, since it may be used proleptically there. In any case, the
infliction of the ban upon this town can only be explained from the fact
that Moses had pronounced the ban upon all the towns of the king of
Arad.

[Jdg 1:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018.md)

From the Negeb Judah turned into the shephelah, and took the three
principal cities of the Philistines along the line of coast, viz., Gaza,
Askelon, and Ekron, with their territory. The order in which the names
of the captured cities occur is a proof that the conquest took place
from the south. First of all Gaza, the southernmost of all the towns of
the Philistines, the present Guzzeh; then Askelon (Ashkuln), which is
five hours to the north of Gaza; and lastly Ekron, the most northerly of
the five towns of the Philistines, the present Akr (see at [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003).md). The other two, Ashdod and Gath,
do not appear to have been conquered at that time. And even those that
were conquered, the Judaeans were unable to hold long. In the time of
Samson they were all of them in the hands of the Philistines again (see
[Jdg 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019.md); [Jdg
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001.md).; [Sa1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#010), etc..md). - In [Jdg
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#019.md) we have a brief summary of the
results of the contests for the possession of the land. "Jehovah was
with Judah;" and with His help they took possession of the mountains.
And they did nothing more; "for the inhabitants of the plain they were
unable to exterminate, because they had iron chariots." הורישׁ has two
different meanings in the two clauses: first (ויּרשׁ), to seize upon a
possession which has been vacated by the expulsion or destruction of its
former inhabitants; and secondly (להורישׁ, with the accusative, of the
inhabitants), to drive or exterminate them out of their possessions-a
meaning which is derived from the earlier signification of making it an
emptied possession (see [Exo 34:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#024.md);
[Num 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#021), etc..md). "The mountain" here
includes the south-land (the Negeb), as the only distinction is between
mountains and plain. "The valley" is the shephelah ([Jdg
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#009)). להורישׁ לא, he was not (able.md) to
drive out. The construction may be explained from the fact that לא is to
be taken independently here as in [Amo
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010.md), in the same sense in which אין
before the infinitive is used in later writings ([Ch2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md); [Est
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#002.md); [Est
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008.md); [Ecc
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014.md) : see Ges. 132-3, anm. 1; Ewald,
237, e.). On the iron chariots, i.e., the chariots tipped with iron, see
at [Jos 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016.md). - To this there is
appended, in v. 20, the statement that "they gave Hebron unto Caleb,"
etc., which already occurred in [Jos
15:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md), and was there explained; and
also in [Jdg 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#012.md) the remark, that the
Benjaminites did not drive out the Jebusite who dwelt in Jerusalem,
which is so far in place here, that it shows, on the one hand, that the
children of Judah did not bring Jerusalem into the undisputed possession
of the Israelites through this conquest, and, on the other hand, that it
was not their intention to diminish the inheritance of Benjamin by the
conquest of Jerusalem, and they had not taken the city for themselves.
For further remarks, see at [Jdg 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008.md).

The hostile attacks of the other tribes upon the Canaanites who remained
in the land are briefly summed up in [Jdg
1:22-36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#022.md). Of these the taking of Bethel
is more fully described in [Jdg
1:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#022.md). Besides this, nothing more is
given than the list of the towns in the territories of western Manasseh
([Jdg 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027.md), [Jdg
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#028).md), Ephraim ([Jdg
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#029).md), Zebulun ([Jdg
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030).md), Asher ([Jdg
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031.md), [Jdg
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#032).md), Naphtali ([Jdg
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#033).md), and Dan ([Jdg
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034.md), [Jdg
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#035).md), out of which the Canaanites
were not exterminated by these tribes. Issachar is omitted; hardly,
however, because that tribe made no attempt to disturb the Canaanites,
as Bertheau supposes, but rather because none of its towns remained in
the hands of the Canaanites.

[Judges 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 1:22</span></span>

Like Judah, so also ("they also," referring back to [Jdg
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002.md), [Jdg
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003).md) did the house of Joseph (Ephraim
and western Manasseh) renew the hostilities with the Canaanites who were
left in their territory after the death of Joshua. The children of
Joseph went up against Bethel, and Jehovah was with them, so that they
were able to conquer the city. Bethel had indeed been assigned to the
tribe of Benjamin ([Jos 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#022).md), but it
was situated on the southern boundary of the tribe-land of Ephraim ([Jos
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002.md); [Jos
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013).md); so that the tribe of Joseph
could not tolerate the Canaanites in this border town, if it would
defend its own territory against them, and purge it entirely of them.
This is a sufficient explanation of the fact that this one conquest is
mentioned, and this only, without there being any necessity to seek for
the reason, as Bertheau does, in the circumstance that the town of
Bethel came into such significant prominence in the later history of
Israel, and attained the same importance in many respects in relation to
the northern tribes, as that which Jerusalem attained in relation to the
southern. For the fact that nothing more is said about the other
conquests of the children of Joseph, may be explained simply enough on
the supposition that they did not succeed in rooting out the Canaanites
from the other fortified towns in their possessions; and therefore there
was nothing to record about any further conquests, as the result of
their hostilities was merely this, that they did not drive the
Canaanites out of the towns named in [Jdg
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027.md), [Jdg
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#029.md), but simply made them tributary.
יתירוּ, they had it explored, or spied out. תּוּר is construed with בּ
here, because the spying laid hold, as it were, of its object. Bethel,
formerly Luz, now Beitin: see at [Gen
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019.md) and [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md).

[Judges 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 1:24</span></span>

And the watchmen (i.e., the spies sent out to explore Bethel) saw a man
coming out of the town, and got him to show them the entrance into it,
under a promise that they would show him favour, i.e., would spare the
lives of himself and his family (see [Jos
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#012).md); whereupon they took the town
and smote it without quarter, according to the law in [Deu
20:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#016.md), letting none but the man and
his family go. By "the entrance into the city" we are not to understand
the gate of the town, but the way or mode by which they could get into
the town, which was no doubt fortified.

[Judges 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 1:26</span></span>

The man whom they had permitted to go free, went with his family into
the land of the Hittites, and there built a town, to which he gave the
name of his earlier abode, viz., Luz. The situation of this Luz is
altogether unknown. Even the situation of the land of the Hittites
cannot be more precisely determined; for we find Hittites at Hebron in
the times of Abraham and Moses (Gen 23), and also upon the mountains of
Palestine ([Num 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029).md), and at a later
period on the north-east of Canaan on the borders of Syria ([Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029).md). That the Hittites were one of
the most numerous and widespread of the tribes of the Canaanites, is
evident from the fact that, in [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004.md), the Canaanites generally are
described as Hittites.

[Judges 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 1:27</span></span>

Manasseh did not root out the Canaanites from the towns which had been
allotted to it in the territory of Asher and Issachar ([Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011).md), but simply made them
tributary. וגו בּית־שׁאן הורישׁ לא, considered by itself, might be
rendered: "Manasseh did not take possession of Bethshean," etc. But as
we find, in the further enumeration, the inhabitants of the towns
mentioned instead of the towns themselves, we must take הורישׁ in the
sense of rooting out, driving out of their possessions, which is the
only rendering applicable in [Jdg
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#028.md); and thus, according to a very
frequent metonymy, must understand by the towns the inhabitants of the
towns. "Manasseh did not exterminate Bethshean," i.e., the inhabitants
of Bethshean, etc. All the towns mentioned here have already been
mentioned in [Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md), the only
difference being, that they are not placed in exactly the same order,
and that Endor is mentioned there after Dor; whereas here it has no
doubt fallen out through a copyist's error, as the Manassites, according
to [Jos 17:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#012.md), did not exterminate
the Canaanites from all the towns mentioned there. The change in the
order in which the towns occur, - Taanach being placed next to
Bethshean, whereas in Joshua Bethshean is followed by Ibleam, which is
placed last but one in the present list, - may be explained on the
supposition, that in [Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md),
Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo are placed together, as forming a triple
league, of which the author of our book has taken no notice. Nearly all
these towns were in the plain of Jezreel, or in the immediate
neighbourhood of the great commercial roads which ran from the coast of
the Mediterranean to Damascus and central Asia. The Canaanites no doubt
brought all their strength to bear upon the defence of these roads; and
in this their war-chariots, against which Israel could do nothing in the
plain of Jezreel, were of the greatest service (see [Jdg
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#019.md); [Jos
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016).md). For further particulars
respecting the situation of the different towns, see at [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md). Dor only was on the coast of
the Mediterranean (see at [Jos 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002).md),
and being a commercial emporium of the Phoenicians, would certainly be
strongly fortified, and very difficult to conquer.

[Jdg 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#028.md)

As the Israelites grew strong, they made serfs of the Canaanites (see at
[Gen 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#015).md). When this took place is
not stated; but at all events, it was only done gradually in the course
of the epoch of the judges, and not for the first time during the reign
of Solomon, as Bertheau supposes on the ground of [Kg1
9:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020.md) and [Kg1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012.md), without considering that even in
the time of David the Israelites had already attained the highest power
they ever possessed, and that there is nothing at variance with this in
[Kg1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012.md) and [Kg1
9:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020.md). For it by no means follows,
from the appointment of a prefect by Solomon over the districts of
Taanach, Megiddo, and Bethshean ([Kg1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012).md), that these districts had only
been conquered by Solomon a short time before, when we bear in mind that
Solomon appointed twelve such prefects over all Israel, to remit in
regular order the national payments that were required for the
maintenance of the regal court. Nor does it follow, that because Solomon
employed the descendants of the Canaanites who were left in the land as
tributary labourers in the erection of his great buildings, therefore he
was the first who succeeded in compelling those Canaanites who were not
exterminated when the land was conquered by Joshua, to pay tribute to
the different tribes of Israel.

[Judges 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 1:29</span></span>

Ephraim did not root out the Canaanites in Gezer ([Jdg
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#029).md), as has already been stated in
[Jos 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010.md).

[Jdg 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030.md)

Zebulun did not root out the Canaanites in Kitron and Nahalol.

[Jdg 1:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031.md)

Asher did not root out those in Acco, etc. Acco: a seaport town to the
north of Carmel, on the bay which is called by its name; it is called
Ake by Josephus, Diod. Sic., and Pliny, and was afterwards named
Ptolemais from one of the Ptolemys (1 Macc. 5:15, 21; 10:1, etc.; [Act
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#007).md). The Arabs called it Akka, and
this was corrupted by the crusaders into Acker or Acre. During the
crusades it was a very flourishing maritime and commercial town; but it
subsequently fell into decay, and at the present time has a population
of about 5000, composed of Mussulmans, Druses, and Christians (see C. v.
Raumer, Pal. p. 119; Rob. Bibl. Res.; and Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp.
725ff.). Sidon, now Saida: see at [Jos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008.md). Achlab is only mentioned here,
and is not known. Achzib, i.e., Ecdippa: see at [Jos
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029.md). Helbah is unknown. Aphek is the
present Afkah: see [Jos 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004.md); [Jos
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030.md). Rehob is unknown: see at [Jos
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md), [Jos
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030.md). As seven out of the twenty-two
towns of Asher ([Jos 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030).md) remained
in the hands of the Canaanites, including such important places as Acco
and Sidon, it is not stated in [Jdg
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#032.md), as in [Jdg
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#029.md), [Jdg
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030.md), that "the Canaanites dwelt among
them," but that "the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites," to show that
the Canaanites held the upper hand. And for this reason the expression
"they became tributaries" ([Jdg 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030.md),
[Jdg 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#035), etc..md) is also omitted.

[Jdg 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#033.md)

Naphtali did not root out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and
Beth-anath, two fortified towns, the situation of which is still unknown
(see at [Jos 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#038).md); so that this
tribe also dwelt among the Canaanites, but did not make them tributary.

[Jdg 1:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034.md)

Still less were the Danites able to drive the Canaanites out of their
inheritance. On the contrary, the Amorites forced Dan up into the
mountains, and would not suffer them to come down into the plain. But
the territory allotted to the Danytes was almost all in the plain (see
at [Jos 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#040).md). If, therefore, they
were forced out of that, they were almost entirely excluded from their
inheritance. The Amorites emboldened themselves (see at [Deu
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#005).md) to dwell in Har-cheres, Ajalon,
and Shaalbim. On the last two places see [Jos
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#042.md), where Ir-shemesh is also
mentioned. This combination, and still more the meaning of the names
Har-cheres, i.e., sun-mountain, and Ir-shemesh, i.e., sun-town, make the
conjecture a very probable one, that Har-cheres is only another name for
Ir-shemesh, i.e., the present Ain Shems (see at [Jos
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010), and Rob. Pal. iii. pp. 17, 18.md).
This pressure on the part of the Amorites induced a portion of the
Danites to emigrate, and seek for an inheritance in the north of
Palestine (see Judg 18). On the other hand, the Amorites were gradually
made tributary by the powerful tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, who
bounded Dan on the north. "The hand of the house of Joseph lay heavy,"
sc., upon the Amorites in the towns already named on the borders of
Ephraim. For the expression itself, comp. [Sa1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006.md); [Psa
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md).

[Judges 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 1:36</span></span>

In order to explain the supremacy of the Amorites in the territory of
Dan, a short notice is added concerning their extension in the south of
Palestine. "The territory of the Amorites was," i.e., extended (viz., at
the time of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites), "from the ascent
of Akrabbim, from the rock onwards and farther up." Maaleh-Akrabbim
(ascensus scorpiorum) was the sharply projecting line of cliffs which
intersected the Ghor below the Dead Sea, and formed the southern
boundary of the promised land (see at [Num
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#004.md) and [Jos
15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#002).md). מהסּלע, from the rock, is not
doubt given as a second point upon the boundary of the Amoritish
territory, as the repetition of the מן clearly shows, notwithstanding
the omission of the copula ו. הסּלע, the rock, is supposed by the
majority of commentators to refer to the city of Petra, the ruins of
which are still to be seen in the Wady Musa (see Burckhardt, Syr. pp.
703ff.; Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 573ff., iii. 653), and which is distinctly
mentioned in [Kg2 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md) under the name
of הסּלע, and in [Isa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md) is called
simply סלע. Petra is to the southeast of the Scorpion heights.
Consequently, with this rendering the following word ומעלה (and upward)
would have to be taken in the sense of ulterius (and beyond), and
Rosenmller's explanation would be the correct one: "The Amorites not
only extended as far as the town of Petra, or inhabited it, but they
even carried their dwellings beyond this towards the tops of those
southern mountains." But a description of the territory of the Amorites
in its southern extension into Arabia Petraea does not suit the context
of the verse, the object of which is to explain how it was that the
Amorites were in a condition to force back the Danites out of the plain
into the mountains, to say nothing of the fact that it is questionable
whether the Amorites ever really spread so far, for which we have
neither scriptural testimony nor evidence of any other kind. On this
ground even Bertheau has taken ומעלה as denoting the direction upwards,
i.e., towards the north, which unquestionably suits the usage of מעלה as
well as the context of the passage. But it is by no means in harmony
with this to understand הסּלע as referring to Petra; for in that case we
should have two boundary points mentioned, the second of which was
farther south than the first. Now a historian who had any acquaintance
with the topography, would never have described the extent of the
Amoritish territory from south to north in such a way as this,
commencing with the Scorpion heights on the north, then passing to
Petra, which was farther south, and stating that from this point the
territory extended farther towards the north. If ומעלה therefore refers
to the extension of the territory of the Amorites in a northerly
direction, the expression "from the rock" cannot be understood as
relating to the city of Petra, but must denote some other locality well
known to the Israelites by that name. Such a locality there undoubtedly
was in the rock in the desert of Zin, which had become celebrated
through the events that took place at the water of strife ([Num
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008.md), [Num
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#010).md), and to which in all
probability this expression refers. The rock in question was at the
south-west corner of Canaan, on the southern edge of the Rakhma plateau,
to which the mountains of the Amorites extended on the south-west (comp.
[Num 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025.md), [Num
14:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#044.md), with [Deu
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044).md). And this would be very
appropriately mentioned here as the south-western boundary of the
Amorites, in connection with the Scorpion heights as their south-eastern
boundary, for the purpose of giving the southern boundary of the
Amorites in its full extent from east to west.
