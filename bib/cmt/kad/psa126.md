The Harvest of Joy after the Sowing of Tears

It is with this Psalm, which the favourite word Zion connects with the
preceding Psalm, exactly as with [Psa
85:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md), which also gives thanks for
the restoration of the captive ones of Israel on the one hand, and on
the other hand has to complain of the wrath that is still not entirely
removed, and prays for a national restoration. There are expositors
indeed who also transfer the grateful retrospect with which this Song of
degrees ([Psa 126:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001).md), like that
Korahitic Psalm ([Psa 126:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002).md),
begins, into the future (among the translators Luther is at least more
consistent than the earlier ones); but they do this for reasons which
are refuted by [Psa 85:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md), and which
are at once silenced when brought face to face with the requirements of
the syntax.

[Psalms 126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 126:1</span></span>

When passages like [Isa 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md); [Gen
47:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#025.md), or others where והיינו is perf.
consec., are appealed to in order to prove that היינוּ כּחלמים may
signify erimus quasi somniantes, they are instances that are different
in point of syntax. Any other rendering than that of the lxx is here
impossible, viz.: Ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέψαι κύριον τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν Σιὼν
ἐγενήθημεν ὡς παρακεκλημένοι (כּנחמים? - Jerome correctly, quasi
somniantes). It is, however, just as erroneous when Jerome goes on to
render: tunc implebitur risu os nostrum; for it is true the future after
אז has a future signification in passages where the context relates to
matters of future history, as in [Psa
96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md); [Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md), but it always has the
signification of the imperfect after the key-note of the historical past
has once been struck, [Exo 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md); [Jos
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030.md); [Jos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md); [Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md); [Kg1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#021.md); [Kg2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016.md); [Job
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#021.md); it is therefore, tunc
implebatur. It is the exiles at home again upon the soil of their
fatherland who here cast back a glance into the happy time when their
destiny suddenly took another turn, by the God of Israel disposing the
heart of the conqueror of Babylon to set them at liberty, and to send
them to their native land in an honourable manner. שׁיבת is not
equivalent to שׁבית, nor is there any necessity to read it thus
(Olshausen, Bצttcher, and Hupfeld). שׁיבה (from שׁוּב, like בּיאה, קימה)
signifies the return, and then those returning; it is, certainly, an
innovation of this very late poet. When Jahve brought home the
homeward-bound ones of Zion - the poet means to say - we were as
dreamers. Does he mean by this that the long seventy years' term of
affliction lay behind us like a vanished dream (Joseph Kimchi), or that
the redemption that broke upon us so suddenly seemed to us at first not
to be a reality but a beautiful dream? The tenor of the language favours
the latter: as those not really passing through such circumstances, but
only dreaming. Then - the poet goes on to say - our mouth was filled
with laughter ([Job 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021).md) and our
tongue with a shout of joy, inasmuch, namely, as the impression of the
good fortune which contrasted so strongly with our trouble hitherto,
compelled us to open our mouth wide in order that our joy might break
forth in a full stream, and our jubilant mood impelled our tongue to
utter shouts of joy, which knew no limit because of the inexhaustible
matter of our rejoicing. And how awe-inspiring was Israel's position at
that time among the peoples! and what astonishment the marvellous change
of Israel's lot produced upon them! Even the heathen confessed that it
was Jahve's work, and that He had done great things for them ([Joe
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020.md)., [Sa1
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#024).md) - the glorious predictions of
Isaiah, as in [Psa 45:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014.md); 52:10, and
elsewhere, were being fulfilled. The church on its part seals that
confession coming from the mouth of the heathen. This it is that made
them so joyful, that God had acknowledged them by such a mighty deed.

[Psalms 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 126:4</span></span>

But still the work so mightily and graciously begun is not completed.
Those who up to the present time have returned, out of whose heart this
Psalm is, as it were, composed, are only like a small vanguard in
relation to the whole nation. Instead of שׁבותנו the Kerמ here reads
שׁביתנוּ, from שׁבית, [Num 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029.md),
after the form בכית in [Gen 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#004.md). As
we read elsewhere that Jerusalem yearns after her children, and Jahve
solemnly assures her, "thou shalt put them all on as jewels and gird
thyself like a bride" ([Isa 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018).md), so
here the poet proceeds from the idea that the holy land yearns after an
abundant, reanimating influx of population, as the Negeb (i.e., the
Judaean south country, [Gen 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001.md), and
in general the south country lying towards the desert of Sinai) thirsts
for the rain-water streams, which disappear in the summer season and
regularly return in the winter season. Concerning אפיק, "a water-holding
channel," vid., on [Psa 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016.md). If we
translate converte captivitatem nostram (as Jerome does, following the
lxx), we shall not know what to do with the figure, whereas in
connection with the rendering reduc captivos nostros it is just as
beautifully adapted to the object as to the governing verb. If we have
rightly referred negeb not to the land of the Exile but to the Land of
Promise, whose appearance at this time is still so unlike the promise,
we shall now also understand by those who sow in tears not the exiles,
but those who have already returned home, who are again sowing the old
soil of their native land, and that with tears, because the ground is so
parched that there is little hope of the seed springing up. But this
tearful sowing will be followed by a joyful harvest. One is reminded
here of the drought and failure of the crops with which the new colony
was visited in the time of Haggai, and of the coming blessing promised
by the prophet with a view to the work of the building of the Temple
being vigorously carried forward. Here, however, the tearful sowing is
only an emblem of the new foundation-laying, which really took place not
without many tears ([Ezr 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012).md), amidst
sorrowful and depressed circumstances; but in its general sense the
language of the Psalm coincides with the language of the Preacher on the
Mount, [Mat 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004.md) : Blessed are those
who mourn, for they shall be comforted. The subject to [Psa
126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006.md) is the husbandman, and without a
figure, every member of the ecclesia pressa. The gerundial construction
in [Psa 126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006.md) (as in [Sa2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#016.md); [Jer
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#004.md), cf. the more Indo-Germanic style
of expression in [Sa2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030).md) depicts
the continual passing along, here the going to and fro of the
sorrowfully pensive man; and [Psa
126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006.md) the undoubted coming and sure
appearing of him who is highly blessed beyond expectation. The former
bears משׁך הזּרע, the seed-draught, i.e., the handful of seed taken from
the rest for casting out (for משׁך הזּרע in [Amo
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md) signifies to cast forth the seed
along the furrows); the latter his sheaves, the produce (תּבוּאה), such
as puts him to the blush, of his, as it appeared to him, forlorn sowing.
As by the sowing we are to understand everything that each individual
contributes towards the building up of the kingdom of God, so by the
sheaves, the wholesome fruit which, by God bestowing His blessing upon
it beyond our prayer and comprehension, springs up from it.
