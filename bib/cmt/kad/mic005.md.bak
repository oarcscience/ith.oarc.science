### [Micah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md)

[Micah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 5:1</span></span>

(Heb. Bib. 4:14). "Now wilt thou gather in troops, thou daughter of
troops; they lay siege against us; with the staff they smite the judge
of Israel upon the cheek." With ‛attâh (now) the prophet's address turns
once more to the object introduced with ‛attâh in [Mic
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md). For we may see clearly enough
from the omission of the cop. Vav, which could not be left out if it
were intended to link on [Mic 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md) to
[Mic 4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md), that this ‛attâh points
back to [Mic 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md), and is not attached
to the ve‛attâh in [Mic 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md), for the
purpose of introducing a fresh occurrence to follow the event mentioned
in [Mic 4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md). "The prophecy in [Mic
4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md) explains the ground of that in
[Mic 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md), [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md), and the one in [Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md) sounds like a conclusion drawn
from this explanation. The explanation in [Mic
4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md) is enclosed on both sides by
that which it explains. By returning in [Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md) to the thoughts expressed in [Mic
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md), the prophet rounds off the
strophe in 4:9-5:1" (Caspari). The words are addressed to the daughter
Zion, who alone is addressed with every ‛attâh, and generally throughout
the entire section. Bath-gegūd, daughter of the troop, might mean: thou
nation accustomed or trained to form troops, thou warlike Zion. But this
does not apply to what follows, in which a siege alone is mentioned.
This turn is given to the expression, rather "for the purpose of
suggesting the thought of a crowd of people pressing anxiously together,
as distinguished from gedūd, an invading troop." The verb hithgōdēd does
not mean here to scratch one's self or make incisions ([Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001), etc..md), but, as in [Jer
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md), to press or crowd together; and
the thought is this: Now crowd together with fear in a troop, for he
(sc., the enemy) sets, or prepares, a siege against us. In עלינוּ the
prophet includes himself in the nation as being a member of it. He finds
himself in spirit along with the people besieged Zion. The siege leads
to conquest; for it is only in consequence of this that the judge of
Israel can be smitten with the rod upon the cheek, i.e., be shamefully
ill treated (compare [Kg1 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md); [Psa
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008.md); [Job
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010).md). The judge of Israel, whether
the king or the Israelitish judges comprehended in one, cannot be
thought of as outside the city at the time when the city is besieged. Of
all the different effects of the siege of the city the prophet singles
out only this one, viz., the ill-treatment of the judge, because
"nothing shows more clearly how much misery and shame Israel will have
to endure for its present sins" (Caspari). "The judge of Israel" is the
person holding the highest office in Israel. This might be the king, as
in [Amo 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#003.md) (cf. [Sa1
8:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#005.md), [Sa1
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#020).md), since the Israelitish king was
the supreme judge in Israel, or the true possessor of the judicial
authority and dignity. But the expression is hardly to be restricted to
the king, still less is it meant in distinction from the king, as
pointing back to the time when Israel had no king, and was only governed
by judges; but the judge stands for the king here, on the one hand with
reference to the threat in [Mic 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md),
[Mic 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009.md), [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md), where the heads and princes of
Israel are described as unjust and ungodly judges, and on the other hand
as an antithesis to mōshēl in [Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md). As the Messiah is not called king
there, but mōshēl, ruler, as the possessor of supreme authority; so here
the possessor of judicial authority is called shōphēt, to indicate the
reproach which would fall upon the king and the leaders of the nation on
account of their unrighteousness. The threat in this verse does not
refer, however, to the Roman invasion. Such an idea can only be
connected with the assumption already refuted, that [Mic
4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md) point to the times of the
Maccabees, and no valid argument can be adduced to support it. In the
verse before us the prophet reverts to the oppression predicted in [Mic
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md) and [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md), so that the remarks already made
in [Mic 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md) apply to the fulfilment
of what is predicted here. The principal fulfilment occurred in the
Chaldaean period; but the fulfilment was repeated in every succeeding
siege of Jerusalem until the destruction of the city by the Romans. For,
according to [Mic 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003.md), Israel will be
given up to the power of the empire of the world until the coming of the
Messiah; that is to say, not merely till His birth or public appearance,
but till the nation shall accept the Messiah, who has appeared as its
own Redeemer.

[Micah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 5:2</span></span>

The previous announcement of the glory to which Zion is eventually to
attain, is now completed by the announcement of the birth of the great
Ruler, who through His government will lead Israel to this, the goal of
its divine calling. [Mic 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md). "And
thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, too small to be among the thousands of Judah,
out of thee will He come forth to me who will be Ruler over Israel; and
His goings forth are from the olden time, from the days of eternity."
The ואתּה, with which this new section of the proclamation of salvation
opens, corresponds to the ואתּה in [Mic
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008.md). Its former government is to
return to Zion ([Mic 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008).md), and out of
little Bethlehem is the possessor of this government to proceed, viz.,
the Ruler of Israel, who has sprung from eternity. This thought is so
attached to [Mic 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md), that the divine
exaltation of the future Ruler of Israel is contrasted with the deepest
degradation of the judge. The names Bethlehem Ephratah ('Ephrâth and
'Ephrâthâh, i.e., the fertile ones, or the fruit-fields, being the
earlier name; by the side of which Bēth-lechem, bread-house, had arisen
even in the patriarchal times: see [Gen
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#019.md); [Gen
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007.md); [Rut
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011).md) are connected together to give
greater solemnity to the address, and not to distinguish the Judaean
Bethlehem from the one in Zebulun ([Jos
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015).md), since the following words,
"among the thousands of Judah," provide sufficiently for this. In the
little town the inhabitants are addressed; and this explains the
masculines אתּה, צעיר, and ממּך, as the prophet had them in his mind
when describing the smallness of the little town, which is called κώμη
in [Joh 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042.md). צעיר להיות, literally
"small with regard to the being among the 'ălâphı̄m of Judah," i.e., too
small to have a place among them. Instead of the more exact מהיות, להיות
is probably chosen, simply because of the following להיות.

(Note: The omission of the article before צעיר, and the use of להיות
instead of מהיות, do not warrant the alteration in the text which Hitzig
proposes, viz., to strike out להיות as erroneous, and to separate the ה
from אפרתה and connect it with צעיר = אפרת הצּעיר; for the assertion
that צעיר, if used in apposition, must have the article, is just as
unfounded as the still further remark, that "to say that Bethlehem was
too small to be among the 'ălaphı̄m of Judah is incorrect and at variance
with [Sa1 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#006.md), [Sa1
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#029.md)," since these passages by no
means prove that Bethlehem formed an 'eleph by itself.)

'Alâphı̄m, thousands - an epithet used as early as [Num
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#016.md); [Num
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#004.md), to denote the families,
mishpâchōth, i.e., larger sections into which the twelve tribes of
Israel were divided (see the comm. on [Num
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#016.md) and [Exo
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#025).md) - does not stand for sârē
'ălâphı̄m, the princes of the families; since the thought is simply this,
that Bethlehem is too small for its population to form an independent
'eleph. We must not infer from this, however, that it had not a thousand
inhabitants, as Caspari does; since the families were called 'ălâphı̄m,
not because the number of individuals in them numbered a thousand, but
because the number of their families or heads of families was generally
somewhere about a thousand (see my biblische Archologie, 140).
Notwithstanding this smallness, the Ruler over Israel is to come forth
out of Bethlehem. יצא מן does not denote descent here, as in [Gen
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#006.md) for example, so that Bethlehem
would be regarded as the father of the Messiah, as Hofmann supposes, but
is to be explained in accordance with [Jer
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md), "A Ruler will go forth out of
the midst of it" (cf. [Zac 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004).md); and
the thought is simply this, "Out of the population of the little
Bethlehem there will proceed and arise." לי (to me) refers to Jehovah,
in whose name the prophet speaks, and expresses the thought that this
coming forth is subservient to the plan of the Lord, or connected with
the promotion of His kingdom, just as in the words of God to Samuel in
[Sa1 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md), "I have provided me a King
among his sons," to which Micah most probably alluded for the purpose of
showing the typical relation of David to the Messiah. להיות מושׁל is
really the subject to יצא, the infinitive להיות being used as a relative
clause, like לכסּות in [Hos 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011.md), in
the sense of "who is destined to be ruler." But instead of simply saying
יצא מושׁל ישׂראל, Micah gives the sentence the turn he does, for the
purpose of bringing sharply out the contrast between the natural
smallness of Bethlehem and the exalted dignity to which it would rise,
through the fact that the Messiah would issue from it. בּישׂראל, not in,
but over Israel, according to the general meaning of משׁל ב. The article
is omitted before mōshēl, because the only thing of primary importance
was to give prominence to the idea of ruling; and the more precise
definition follows immediately afterwards in וּמוצאתיו וגו. The meaning
of this clause of the verse depends upon our obtaining a correct view
not only of מוצאות, but also of the references to time which follow.
מוצאה, the fem. of מוצא, may denote the place, the time, the mode, or
the act of going out. The last meaning, which Hengstenberg disputes, is
placed beyond all doubt by [Hos 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003.md);
[Kg1 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md); [Eze
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#004.md), and [Sa2
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#025.md). The first of these senses, in
which מוצא occurs most frequently, and in which even the form מוצאות is
used in the keri in [Kg2 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#027.md), which
is the only other passage in which this form occurs, does not suit the
predicate מימי עולם here, since the days of eternity cannot be called
places of departure; nor is it required by the correlate ממּך, i.e., out
of Bethlehem, because the idea which predominates in Bethlehem is that
of the population, and not that of the town or locality; and in general,
the antithesis between hemistich a and b does not lie in the idea of
place, but in the insignificance of Bethlehem as a place of exit for Him
whose beginnings are in the days of eternity. We take מוצאות in the
sense of goings forth, exits, as the meaning "times of going forth"
cannot be supported by a single passage. Both קדם and ימי עולם are used
to denote hoary antiquity; for example in [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md) and [Mic
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#020.md), where it is used of the
patriarchal age. Even the two together are so used in [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md), where they are combined for the
sake of emphasis. But both words are also used in [Pro
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md) and [Pro
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023.md) to denote the eternity preceding
the creation of the world, because man, who lives in time, and is bound
to time in his mode of thought, can only picture eternity to himself as
time without end. Which of these two senses is the one predominating
here, depends upon the precise meaning to be given to the whole verse.

It is now generally admitted that the Ruler proceeding from Bethlehem is
the Messiah, since the idea that the words refer to Zerubbabel, which
was cherished by certain Jews, according to the assertion of Chrysostom,
Theodoret, and others, is too arbitrary to have met with any acceptance.
Coming forth out of Bethlehem involves the idea of descent. Consequently
we must not restrict מוצאתיו (His goings forth) to the appearance of the
predicted future Ruler in the olden time, or to the revelations of the
Messiah as the Angel of Jehovah even in the patriarchal age, but must so
interpret it that it at least affirms His origin as well. Now the origin
of the Angel of the Lord, who is equal to God, was not in the olden time
in which He first of all appeared to the patriarchs, but before the
creation of the world - in eternity. Consequently we must not restrict
מקּדם מימי עולם (from of old, from the days of eternity) to the olden
time, or exclude the idea of eternity in the stricter sense.
Nevertheless Micah does not announce here the eternal proceeding of the
Son from the Father, or of the Logos from God, the generatio filii
aeterna, as the earlier orthodox commentators supposed. This is
precluded by the plural מוצאתיו, which cannot be taken either as the
plur. majestatis, or as denoting the abstract, or as an indefinite
expression, but points to a repeated going out, and forces us to the
assumption that the words affirm both the origin of the Messiah before
all worlds and His appearances in the olden time, and do not merely
express the thought, that "from an inconceivably remote and lengthened
period the Ruler has gone forth, and has been engaged in coming, who
will eventually issue from Bethlehem" (Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, ii. 1, p.
9).

(Note: We must reject in the most unqualified manner the attempts that
have been made by the Rabbins in a polemical interest, and by
rationalistic commentators from a dread of miracles, to deprive the
words of their deeper meaning, so as to avoid admitting that we have any
supernatural prediction here, whether by paraphrasing "His goings forth"
into "the going forth of His name" (we have this even in the Chaldee),
or the eternal origin into an eternal predestination (Calv.), or by
understanding the going forth out of Bethlehem as referring to His
springing out of the family of David, which belonged to Bethlehem
(Kimchi, Abarb., and all the later Rabbins and more modern
Rationalists). According to this view, the olden time and the days of
eternity would stand for the primeval family; and even if such a quid
pro quo were generally admissible, the words would contain a very
unmeaning thought, since David's family was not older than any of the
other families of Israel and Judah, whose origin also dated as far back
as the patriarchal times, since the whole nation was descended from the
twelve sons of Jacob, and thought them from Abraham. (See the more
elaborate refutation of these views in Hengstenberg's Christology, i. p.
486ff. translation, and Caspari's Micha, p. 216ff.))

The announcement of the origin of this Ruler as being before all worlds
unquestionably presupposes His divine nature; but this thought was not
strange to the prophetic mind in Micah's time, but is expressed without
ambiguity by Isaiah, when he gives the Messiah the name of "the Mighty
God" ([Isa 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md); see Delitzsch's comm.
in loc.). We must not seek, however, in this affirmation of the divine
nature of the Messiah for the full knowledge of the Deity, as first
revealed in the New Testament by the fact of the incarnation of God in
Christ, and developed, for example, in the prologue to the Gospel of
John. Nor can we refer the "goings forth" to the eternal proceeding of
the Logos from God, as showing the inward relation of the Trinity within
itself, because this word corresponds to the יצא of the first hemistich.
As this expresses primarily and directly nothing more than His issuing
from Bethlehem, and leaves His descent indefinite, מוצאתיו can only
affirm the going forth from God at the creation of the world, and in the
revelations of the olden and primeval times.

The future Ruler of Israel, whose goings forth reach back into eternity,
is to spring from the insignificant Bethlehem, like His ancestor, king
David. The descent of David from Bethlehem forms the substratum not only
for the prophetic announcement of the fact that the Messiah would come
forth out of this small town, but also for the divine appointment that
Christ was born in Bethlehem, the city of David. He was thereby to be
made known to the people from His very birth as the great promised
descendant of David, who would take possession of the throne of His
father David for ever. As the coming forth from Bethlehem implies birth
in Bethlehem, so do we see from [Mat
2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#005.md), and [Joh
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042.md), that the old Jewish synagogue
unanimously regarded this passage as containing a prophecy of the birth
of the Messiah in Bethlehem. The correctness of this view is also
confirmed by the account in [Mat
2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md); for Matthew simply relates the
arrival of the Magi from the East to worship the new-born King in
accordance with the whole arrangement of his Gospel, because he saw in
this even a fulfilment of Old Testament prophecies.

(Note: In the quotation of this verse in [Mat
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006.md), the substance is given freely
from memory: Καὶ σὺ Βεθλεέμ, γῆ Ἰούδα, οὐδαμῶς ἐλαχίστη εἶ ἐν τοῖς
ἡγεμόσιν Ἰούδα· ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ ἐξελεύσεται ἡγούμενος, ὅστις ποιμανεῖ τὸν
λαόν μου, τὸν Ἰσραήλ The deviations from the original text may be
accounted for from the endeavour to give the sense clearly, and bring
out into more distinct prominence the allusion in the words to David.
The γῆ Ἰούδα, in the place of the Ephrata of the original, has sprung
from [Sa1 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012.md), where Bethlehem is
distinguished from the town of the same name in Zebulun in the account
of the anointing of David as king, as it frequently is in the Old
Testament, by the addition of the word Judah; and γῆ Ἰούδα, "land of
Judah," is attached loosely in apposition to the name Bethlehem, in the
place of the more precise definition, "in the land of Judah." The
alteration of the expression, "too small to be among the thousands of
Judah," into οὐδαμῶς ἐλαχίστη, κ.τ.λ., does not constitute a
discrepancy, but simply alters the thought with an allusion to the
glorification which Bethlehem would receive through the fact of the
Messiah's springing from it. "Micah, looking at its outward condition,
calls it little; but Matthew, looking at the nativity of Christ, by
which this town had been most wondrously honoured and rendered
illustrious, calls it very little indeed" (C. B. Mich.). The
interpretation of באלפי (among the thousands) by ἐν τοῖς ἡγεμόσιν (among
the princes) was very naturally suggested by the personification of
Bethlehem, and still more by the thought of the ἡγούμενος about to
follow; and it does not alter the idea, since the families ('ălâphı̄m)
had their heads, who represented and led them. The last clause, ὅστις
ποιμανεῖ, κ.τ.λ., is simply a paraphrase of בּישׂראל, probably taken
from v. 3, and resting upon [Sa2 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002.md),
and pointing to the typical relation existing between the David born in
Bethlehem and the second David, viz., the Messiah. The second hemistich
of the verse is omitted, because it appeared superfluous so far as the
immediate object of the quotation was concerned.)

[Micah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 5:3</span></span>

"Therefore will He give them up until the time when a travailing woman
hath brought forth, and the remnant of His brethren will return,
together with the sons of Israel. [Mic
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004.md). And He will stand and feed in the
strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah His God, and
they will dwell, for now will He be great to the ends of the earth."
"Therefore" (lâkhēn): i.e., "because the great divine Ruler of Israel,
from whom alone its redemption can proceed, will spring from the little
Bethlehem, and therefore from the degraded family of David" (Caspari).
This is the correct explanation; for the reason why Israel is to be
given up to the power of the nations of the world, and not to be rescued
earlier, does not lie in the appearance of the Messiah as such, but in
His springing from little Bethlehem. The birth of the Messiah in
Bethlehem, and not in Jerusalem the city of David, presupposes that the
family of David, out of which it is to spring, will have lost the
throne, and have fallen into poverty. This could only arise from the
giving up of Israel into the power of its enemies. Micah had already
stated clearly enough in what precedes, that this fate would fall upon
the nation and the royal house of David, on account of its apostasy from
the Lord; so that he could overlook this here, and give prominence to
the other side alone, namely to the fact that, according to the counsel
of God, the future Deliverer and Ruler of Israel would also resemble His
royal ancestor David in the fact that He was not to spring from Zion the
royal city built on high, but from the insignificant country town of
Bethlehem, and that for this very reason Israel was to remain so long
under the power of the nations of the world. The suffix attached to
יתּנם points to ישׂראל in [Mic 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md);
and נתן is applied, as in [Kg1 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#016.md),
to the surrender of Israel into the power of its enemies as a punishment
for its sins. This surrender is not the last of many oppressions, which
are to take place in the period before the birth of the Messiah (the
Roman oppression), but a calamity lasting from the present time, or the
coming of the judgment threatened in ch. 3, until the time of the
Messiah's coming; and יתּנם points back not merely to [Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md), but also to [Mic
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009). The travailing woman (yōlēdâh.md)
is not the community of Israel (Theodoret, Calvin, Vitringa, and
others), but the mother of the Messiah (Cyril, and most of the Christian
expositors, including even Ewald and Hitzig). The supposition that the
congregation is personified here, is precluded not only by the fact that
in the very same sentence the sons of Israel are spoken of in the
plural, but still more by the circumstance that in that case the
bringing forth would be only a figurative representation of the joy
following the pain, in which the obvious allusion in the words to the
Messiah, which is required by the context, and especially by the suffix
to אחיו, which refers to the Messiah, and presupposes that His birth is
referred to in יולדה ילדה, would entirely fall away. But Micah had all
the more ground for speaking of this, inasmuch as Isaiah had already
predicted the birth of the Messiah ([Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md). יולדה has no article, and the
travailing woman is thereby left indefinite, because the thought, "till
He is born," or "till a mother shall bring Him forth," upon which alone
the whole turns, did not require any more precise definition.

In the second clause of the verse there commences the description of the
blessing, which the birth of the Messiah will bring to Israel. The first
blessing will be the return of those that remain of Israel to the Lord
their God. אחיו, the brethren of the Ruler born at Bethlehem, are the
Judaeans as the members of the Messiah's own tribe; just as, in [Sa2
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#013.md), David calls the Judaeans his
brethren, his flesh and bone, in contrast with the rest of the
Israelites. יתר אחיו, the remnant of his brethren, are those who are
rescued from the judgment that has fallen upon Judah; yether, as in [Zep
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009.md) and [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md), denoting the remnant, in
distinction from those who have perished (= שׁארית, [Mic
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md); [Mic
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007), etc..md). ישׁוּבוּן, to return, not
from exile to Canaan, but to Jehovah, i.e., to be concerted. על־בּגי
ישׂ, not "to the sons of Israel;" for although שׁוּב, construed with על,
is met with in the sense of outward return (e.g., [Pro
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011).md) as well as in that of spiritual
return to the Lord ([Ch2 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#009).md), the
former explanation would not give any suitable meaning here, not only
because "the sons of Israel," as distinguished from the brethren of the
Messiah, could not possibly denote the true members of the nation of
God, but also because the thought that the Judaeans are to return, or be
converted, to the Israelites of the ten tribes, is altogether unheard
of, and quite at variance with the idea which runs through all the
prophetic Scriptures of the Old Testament, - namely, that after the
division of the kingdom, Judah formed the kernel of the covenant nation,
with which the rebellious Israelites were to be united once more. על
signifies here together with, at the same time as (Hofmann, Caspari), as
in [Jer 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md) with the verb ילכוּ, and
in [Exo 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022.md) with בּוא; and "the sons
of Israel" are the Israelites of the ten tribes, and, in this
connection, those that are left of the ten tribes. There is no ground
for the objection offered by Hengstenberg to this explanation, namely,
that "it is absurd that the ten tribes should appear to be the principal
persons redeemed;" for this is not implied in the words. The meaning
"together with," for על, is not derived from the primary meaning,
thereupon, in addition to, insuper, as Ewald supposes (217, i), nor from
the idea of accompanying, as Ges. and Dietrich maintain. The persons
introduced with על are never the principal objects, as the two passages
quoted sufficiently prove. The women in [Exo
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022) (על הנּשׁים.md) are not the
principal persons, taking precedence of the men; nor is the house of
Israel placed above the house of Judah in [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md). The use of על in the sense of
together with has been developed rather from the idea of protecting,
shielding, as in [Gen 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012.md), slaying
the mothers upon, i.e., together with, the children, the mothers being
thought of as screening the children, as [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md) and other passages clearly show.
Consequently the person screening the other is the principal person, and
not the one covered or screened. And so here, the brethren of the
Messiah, like the sons of Judah in [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md), which passages is generally so
like the one before us that it might be regarded as an exposition of it,
are those who first receive the blessing coming from the Messiah; and
the sons of Israel are associated with them as those to whom this
blessing only comes in fellowship with them. In [Mic
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003.md) there follows what the Messiah
will do for Israel when it has returned to God. He will feed it (עמר
simply belongs to the pictorial description, as in [Isa
61:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005).md) in the strength of Jehovah. The
feeding, as a frequent figure for governing, reminds of David, whom the
Lord had called from the flock to be the shepherd of His people ([Sa2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002).md). This is done in the strength of
Jehovah, with which He is invested, to defend His flock against wolves
and robbers (see [Joh 10:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011).md).

(Note: The word "feed" expresses what Christ is towards His people, the
flock committed to His care. He does not rule over the church like a
formidable tyrant, who oppresses his people by fear; but He is a
shepherd, and leads His sheep with all the gentleness to be desired. And
inasmuch as we are surrounded on all sides by enemies, the prophet adds,
"He will feed in the strength," etc.; i.e., as much power as there is in
God, so much protection will there be in Christ, whenever it shall be
necessary to defend the church, and guard it against its foes (Calvin).)

This strength is not merely the divine authority with which earthly
rulers are usually endowed ([Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010).md), but גּאון, i.e., the exaltation
or majesty of the name of Jehovah, the majesty in which Jehovah
manifests His deity on earth. The Messiah is El gibbōr (the Mighty God,
[Isa 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005).md), and equipped with the
spirit of might (rūăch gebhūrâh, [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md). "Of His God;" for Jehovah is
the God of this Shepherd or Ruler, i.e., He manifests Himself as God to
Him more than to any other; so that the majesty of Jehovah is revealed
in what He does. In consequence of this feeding, they (the sons of
Israel) sit (yâshâbhū), without being disturbed (cf. [Mic
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004.md); [Lev
26:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005.md); [Sa2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010).md), i.e., will live in perfect
undisturbed peace under His pastoral care. For He (the Messiah) will now
(עתּה, now, referring to the time when He feeds Israel, in contrast with
the former oppression) be great (auctoritate et potentia valebit:
Maurer) to the ends of the earth, i.e., His authority will extend over
the whole earth. Compare the expression in [Luk
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md), οὗτος ἔσται μέγας, which has
sprung from the passage before us, and the parallel in [Mal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014.md).

[Micah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 5:5</span></span>

Under His rule Israel will attain to perfect peace. [Mic
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005.md). "And He will be peace. When
Asshur shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces,
we set up against him seven shepherds and eight princes of men. [Mic
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006.md). And they feed the land of Asshur
with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in his gates; and He rescues from
Asshur when he comes into our land and enters into our border." זה (this
man), viz., He who feeds His people in the majesty of God, will be
peace, i.e., not merely pacis auctor, but He who carries peace within
Himself, and gives it to His people. Compare [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md), "He is our peace," which points
back to this passage. In this relation the Messiah is called the Prince
of peace in [Isa 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md), as securing
peace for Israel in a higher and more perfect sense than Solomon. But in
what manner? This is explained more fully in what follows: viz., (1) by
defending Israel against the attacks of the imperial power ([Isa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md), [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)); (2.md) by exalting it into a power
able to overcome the nations ([Isa
9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007)); and (3.md) by exterminating all
the materials of war, and everything of an idolatrous nature, and so
preventing the possibility of war ([Isa
9:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#010).md). Asshur is a type of the
nations of the world by which the people of the Lord are attacked,
because in the time of the prophet this power was the imperial power by
which Israel was endangered. Against this enemy Israel will set up
seven, yea eight princes, who, under the chief command of the Messiah,
i.e., as His subordinates, will drive it back, and press victoriously
into its land. (On the combination of the numbers seven and eight, see
the discussions at [Amo 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003)..md) Seven is
mentioned as the number of the works proceeding from God, so that seven
shepherds, i.e., princes, would be quite sufficient; and this number is
surpassed by the eight, to express the thought that there might be even
more than were required. נסיכי אדם, not anointed of men, but installed
and invested, from nâsakh, to pour out, to form, to appoint; hence [Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md), vassals, here the
under-shepherds appointed by the Messiah as the upper-shepherd. The
meaning "anointed," which is derived from sūkh, neither suits [Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md) nor [Pro
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023.md) (see Delitzsch on [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md). On the figurative expression
"feed with the sword," for rule, see [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md) and [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md); רעוּ from רעה, not from רעע. The
land of Asshur is called the land of Nimrod, after the founder of the
first empire ([Gen 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#009)..md), to indicate
the character of the imperial power with its hostility to the kingdom of
God. בּפתחיה, in his gates, i.e., cities and fortresses; gates for
cities, as in [Isa 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026.md); [Isa
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002.md), etc.: not at his gates = on his
borders, where the Assyrians stream together for defence (Hitzig,
Caspari, etc.). The borders of a land are never called gates; nor could
a land be devastated or governed from the border, to say nothing of the
fact that ב\[תחיה corresponds to "in thy palaces" in [Mic
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004.md), and leads to the thought that
Asshur is to be fully repaid for what it has done to the kingdom of God.
The thought is rounded off with והצּיל מאשּׁוּר וגו, and so He saves
from Asshur, etc., not merely by the fact that Asshur is driven back to
his own border, and watched there, but by the fact that he is fed in his
own territory with the sword. This victorious conflict with the imperial
power must not be restricted to the spiritual victory of the kingdom of
God over the kingdoms of the world, as Hengstenberg supposes, appealing
to [Mic 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md)., according to which the
Lord will make His people outwardly defenceless before it becomes fully
victorious in Christ (Hengstenberg). For the extermination of the
instruments of war announced in [Mic
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md) refers not to the period of the
exaltation of the people of God into the world-conquering power, but to
the time of consummation, when the hostile powers shall be overcome.
Before the people of God reach this goal, they have not only to carry on
spiritual conflicts, but to fight for existence and recognition even
with the force of arms. The prediction of this conflict and victory is
not at variance with the announcement in [Mic
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002.md), that in the Messianic times all
nations will go on pilgrimage to Zion, and seek for adoption into the
kingdom of God. Both of these will proceed side by side. Many nations,
i.e., great crowds out of all nations, will seek the Lord and His
gospel, and enter into His kingdom; but a great multitude out of all
nations will also persist in their enmity to the Lord and His kingdom
and people, and summon all their power to attack and crush it. The more
the gospel spreads among the nations, the more will the enmity of
unbelief and ungodliness grow, and a conflict be kindled, which will
increase till the Lord shall come to the last judgment, and scatter all
His foes.

[Micah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 5:7</span></span>

But the Messiah will prove Himself to be peace to His people, not only
by the fact that He protects and saves it from the attacks of the
imperial power represented by Asshur, but also by the fact that He
endows His rescuing people with the power to overcome their enemies,
both spiritually and bodily also. [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md). "And the remnant of Jacob will be
in the midst of many nations like dew from Jehovah, like drops of rain
upon grass, which tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for children of men.
[Mic 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008.md). And the remnant of Jacob
will be among the nations, in the midst of many nations, like the lion
among the beasts of the forest, like the young lion among the flocks of
sheep; which, when it goes through, treads down, and tears in pieces,
without deliverer. [Mic 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009.md). High be
thy hand above thine oppressors, and may all thine enemies be rooted
out." Two things are predicted here. In the first place ([Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007).md), Israel will come upon many
nations, like a refreshing dew from Jehovah, which falls plentifully in
drops upon the grass, and will produce and promote new and vigorous life
among them. Dew is here, as indeed everywhere else, a figurative
expression for refreshing, stimulating, enlivening (cf. [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md); [Psa
133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003.md), and [Psa
72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006.md); [Hos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006.md); [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002).md). The spiritual dew, which Jacob
will bring to the nations, comes from Jehovah, and falls in rich
abundance without the cooperation of men. Without the spiritual dew from
above, the nations are grass (cf. [Isa
40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006).md). אשׁר before לא יקוּה does not
refer to עשׂב, but to the principal idea of the preceding clause, viz.,
to טל, to which the explanatory כּרביבים וגו is subordinate. As the
falling of the dew in rain-drops upon the grass does not depend upon the
waiting of men, but proceeds from Jehovah; so will the spiritual
blessing, which will flow over from Israel upon the nations, not depend
upon the waiting of the nations, but will flow to them against and
beyond their expectation. This does not deny the fact that the heathen
wait for the salvation of Jehovah, but simply expresses the thought that
the blessings will not be measured by their expectation. Secondly ([Mic
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008.md), [Mic
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009).md), the rescued Israel will prove
itself a terrible power among the nations, and one to which they will be
obliged to succumb. No proof is needed that [Mic
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008.md), [Mic
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009.md) do not state in what way Israel
will refresh the heathen, as Hitzig supposes. The refreshing dew and the
rending lion cannot possibly be synonymous figures. The similarity of
the introduction to [Mic 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md) and [Mic
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008.md) points of itself to something new.
To the nations Christ is set for the rising and falling of many (compare
[Luk 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034.md); [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md), with [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md) and [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016).md). The people of God shows itself
like a lion, trampling and rending the sheep among the nations of the
world which oppose its beneficent work. And over these may it triumph.
This wish (târōm is optative) closes the promise of the attitude which
Israel will assume among the nations of the world. For târōm yâd (high
be the hand), compare [Isa 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011.md). High
is the hand which accomplishes mighty deeds, which smites and destroys
the foe.

[Micah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 5:10</span></span>

But if Israel conquer the nations in such a way as this, then will
Jehovah fulfil the peace of His people by the destruction of all the
instruments of war, and the extermination of everything of an idolatrous
nature, as well as by the judgment of wrath upon all resisting nations.
[Mic 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md). "And it comes to pass in
that day, is the saying of Jehovah, that I will destroy thy horses out
of the midst of thee, and annihilate thy chariots. [Mic
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#011.md). And I shall destroy the cities
of thy land, and throw down all thy fortresses. [Mic
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#012.md). And I shall destroy the
witchcrafts out of thy hand; and cloud-interpreters shall not be left to
thee. [Mic 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#013.md). And I shall destroy
thy graven images and thy statutes out of the midst of thee; and thou
wilt no more worship the work of thy hands. [Mic
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#014.md). And I shall root out thine
idol-groves out of the midst of thee, and destroy thy cities. [Mic
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#015.md). And I shall execute vengeance in
wrath and fury upon the nations which have not heard." These verses do
not explain [Mic 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008.md), or state how the
extermination of the enemy is to take place, or how Israel is made into
a lion destroying the nations that are hostile to it, namely, by the
fact that the Lord eradicates from its heart all confidence in horses,
chariots, and fortifications, in witchcraft and idolatry (Caspari). This
assumption is at variance with the words themselves, and with the
strophic arrangement of the chapter. There is nothing about trust in
horses, etc., but simply about the extermination of the horses, and
everything else in which the idolatrous nation had sought its strength.
Moreover, the expression והיה ביּום ההוּא, when compared with והיה in
[Mic 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004.md) and [Mic
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006.md), shows at once that these verses
are intended to depict the last and greatest effect produced by the
coming of the Prince of peace in Israel, and overthrows Hengstenberg's
assumption, that the prophet here foretels the destructive work of the
Lord in Israel, which will precede the destruction of the enemy
predicted in [Mic 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md). In that case
בּיּום ההוּא would mean "before that day," a meaning which it can never
have. The prophet passes rather from the attitude of Israel among the
nations, to the description of the internal perfection of the kingdom of
God, which does indeed stand in a reciprocal relation to the former and
proceed simultaneously with it, but which will not be completed till
after the victorious suppression of the foe. Only when the people of God
shall have gained the supremacy over all their enemies, will the time
have arrived for all the instruments of war to be destroyed. When the
world shall be overcome, then will all war cease. The ancient Israel did
indeed put its trust in war-horses, and war-chariots, and fortifications
(cf. [Isa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007).md); but the Messianic
Israel, or the true people of the Lord, will only put its trust in such
things so far as it is not yet pervaded by the power of the peace
brought by the Messiah. And the more it appropriates the spiritual power
of the Prince of peace, the more will the trust in horses and chariots
disappear; so that they will be destroyed, because all war comes to an
end (compare [Isa 9:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004).md). And the
extermination of everything of an idolatrous nature will go hand in hand
with this. Two kinds are mentioned in [Mic
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#012.md) and [Mic
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#013.md), viz., witchcraft and the worship
of idols of their own making. As objects of witchcraft there are
mentioned keshâphı̄m, lit., witchcrafts of different kinds, but the
expression מיּדך limits them to such as are performed with the hand, and
me‛ōnenı̄m (= ‛ōnenı̄m in [Isa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006).md),
lit., cloud-interpreters, or cloud, i.e., storm makers, from ‛ânan, a
kind of witchcraft which cannot be more precisely defined (see Delitzsch
on Isaiah, l.c.). Of the objects of the idolatrous worship there are
mentioned (after [Lev 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001).md) pesı̄lı̄m,
idols made of wood or metal; and מצּבות, stone-images, or stones
dedicated to idols (see at [Kg1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023).md). For [Mic
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#012.md), compare [Isa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#008.md).

[Micah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mic 5:14</span></span>

[Mic 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#014.md) sums up the objects
enumerated in [Mic 5:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md), which are
to be exterminated, for the purpose of rounding off the description; the
only objects of idolatrous worship mentioned being the 'ăshērim, and the
only materials of war, the cities as means of defence. אשׁירים, written
with scriptio plena, as in [Deu 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005.md)
and [Kg2 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016.md), lit., stems of trees
or posts standing upright or set up as idols, which were dedicated to
the Canaanitish goddess of nature (see at [Exo
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013).md). ערים, cities with walls,
gates, and bolts. These two rather subordinate objects are mentioned
instar omnium, to express the entire abolition of war and idolatry. We
must not infer from this, however, that the nation of God will still
have images made by human hands and worship them, during the stage of
its development described in [Mic
5:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md); but must distinguish between
the thought and its formal dress. The gross heathen idolatry, to which
Israel was addicted under the Old Testament, is a figure denoting that
more refined idolatry which will exist even in the church of Christ so
long as sin and unbelief endure. The extermination of every kind of
heathen idolatry is simply the Old Testament expression for the
purification of the church of the Lord from everything of an idolatrous
and ungodly nature. To this there is appended in [Mic
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#015.md) a promise that the Lord will take
vengeance, and wrath, and fury upon the nations which have not heard or
have not observed the words and acts of the Lord, i.e., have not yielded
themselves up to conversion. In other words, He will exterminate every
ungodly power by a fierce judgment, so that nothing will ever be able to
disturb the peace of His people and kingdom again.
