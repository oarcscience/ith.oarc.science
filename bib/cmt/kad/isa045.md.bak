### [Isaiah Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 45:1</span></span>

The first strophe of the first half of this sixth prophecy ([Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024)..md), the subject of which is
Cyrus, the predicted restorer of Jerusalem, of the cities of Judah, and
of the temple, is now followed by a second strophe ([Isa
45:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md), having for its subject Cyrus,
the man through whose irresistible career of conquest the heathen would
be brought to recognise the power of Jehovah, so that heavenly blessings
would come down upon the earth. The naming of the great shepherd of the
nations, and the address of him, are continued in [Isa
45:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md) : "Thus saith Jehovah to His
anointed, to Koresh, whom I have taken by his right hand to subdue
nations before him; and the loins of kings I ungird, to open before him
doors and gates, that they may not continue shut. I shall go before
thee, and level what is heaped up: gates of brass shall I break in
pieces, and bolts of iron shall I smite to the ground. And I shall give
thee treasures of darkness, and jewels of hidden places, that thou
mayest know that I Jehovah am He who called out thy name, (even) the God
of Israel." The words addressed to Cyrus by Jehovah commence in [Isa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002.md), but promises applying to him
force themselves into the introduction, being evoked by the mention of
his name. He is the only king of the Gentiles whom Jehovah ever meshı̄chı̄
(my anointed; lxx τῷ χριστῷ μου). The fundamental principle of the
politics of the empire of the world was all-absorbing selfishness. But
the politics of Cyrus were pervaded by purer motives, and this brought
him eternal honour. The very same thing which the spirit of Darius, the
father of Xerxes, is represented as saying of him in the Persae of
Aeschylus (v. 735), Θεὸς γὰρ οὐκ ἤχθησεν ὡς εὔφρων ἔφυ (for he was not
hateful to God, because he was well-disposed), is here said by the
Spirit of revelation, which by no means regards the virtues of the
heathen as splendida vitia. Jehovah has taken him by his right hand, to
accomplish great things through him while supporting him thus. (On the
inf. rad for rōd, from râdad, to tread down, see Ges. 67, Anm. 3.) The
dual delâthaim has also a plural force: "double doors" (fores) in great
number, viz., those of palaces. After the two infinitives, the verb
passes into the finite tense: "loins of kings I ungird" (discingo;
pittēăch, which refers primarily to the loosening of a fastened garment,
is equivalent to depriving of strength). The gates - namely, those of
the cities which he storms - will not be shut, sc. in perpetuity, that
is to say, they will have to open to him. Jerome refers here to the
account given of the elder Cyrus in Xenophon's Cyropaedia. A general
picture may no doubt be obtained from this of his success in war; but
particular statements need support from other quarters, since it is only
a historical romance. Instead of אושׁר (אושׁר)? in [Isa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002.md), the keri has אישּׁר; just as in
[Psa 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md) it has הישׁר instead of
הושׁר. A hiphil הושׁיר cannot really be shown to have existed, and the
abbreviated future form עושׁר would be altogether without ground or
object here. הדּורים (tumida; like נעיימם, amaena, and others) is meant
to refer to the difficulties piled up in the conqueror's way. The "gates
of brass' (nedhūshâh, brazen, poetical for nechōsheth, brass, as in the
derivative passage, [Psa 107:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#016).md) and
"bolts of iron" remind one more especially of Babylon with its hundred
"brazen gates," the very posts and lintels of which were also of brass
(Herod. i. 179); and the treasures laid up in deep darkness and jewels
preserved in hiding-places, of the riches of Babylon ([Jer
50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037.md); [Jer
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013).md), and especially of those of the
Lydian Sardes, "the richest city of Asia after Babylon" (Cyrop. vii. 2,
11), which Cyrus conquered first. On the treasures which Cyrus acquired
through his conquests, and to which allusion is made in the Persae of
Aeschylus, v. 327 ("O Persian, land and harbour of many riches thou"),
see Plin. h. n. xxxiii. 2. Brerewood estimates the quantity of gold and
silver mentioned there as captured by him at no less than 126,224,000
sterling. And all this success is given to him by Jehovah, that he may
know that it is Jehovah the God of Israel who has called out with his
name, i.e., called out his name, or called him to be what he is, and as
what he shows himself to be.

[Isaiah 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 45:4</span></span>

A second and third object are introduced by a second and third למען.
"For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I called thee
hither by name, surnamed thee when thou knewest me not. I Jehovah, and
there is none else, beside me no God: I equipped thee when thou knewest
me not; that they may know from the rising of the sun, and its going
down, that there is none without me: I Jehovah, and there is none else,
former of the light, and creator of the darkness; founder of peace, and
creator of evil: I Jehovah am He who worketh all this." The ואקרא which
follows the second reason assigned like an apodosis, is construed
doubly: "I called to thee, calling thee by name." The parallel אכנּך
refers to such titles of honour as "my shepherd" and "my anointed,"
which had been given to him by Jehovah. This calling, distinguishing,
and girding, i.e., this equipment of Cyrus, took place at a time when
Cyrus knew nothing as yet of Jehovah, and by this very fact Jehovah made
known His sole Deity. The meaning is, not that it occurred while he was
still worshipping false gods, but, as the refrain-like repetition of the
words "though thou hast not know me" affirms with strong emphasis,
before he had been brought into existence, or could know anything of
Jehovah. The passage is to be explained in the same way as [Jer
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005.md), "Before I formed thee in the
womb, I knew thee" (see Psychol. pp. 36, 37, 39); and what the God of
prophecy here claims for Himself, must not be questioned by false
criticism, or weakened down by false apologetics (i.e., by giving up the
proper name Cyrus as a gloss in [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md) and [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md); or generalizing it into a king's
name, such as Pharaoh, Abimelech, or Agag). The third and last object of
this predicted and realized success of the oppressor of nations and
deliverer of Israel is the acknowledgement of Jehovah, spreading over
the heathen world from the rising and setting of the sun, i.e., in every
direction. The ah of וּממּערבה is not a feminine termination (lxx,
Targ., Jer.), but a feminine suffix with He raphato pro mappic (Kimchi);
compare [Isa 23:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017.md); [Isa
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#017.md) (but not נצּה in [Isa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005.md), or מוּסדה in [Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032)). Shemesh (the sun.md) is a
feminine here, as in [Gen 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md), [Nah
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017.md), [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md), and always in Arabic; for the
west is invariably called מערב (Arab. magrib). In [Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007.md) we are led by the context to
understand by darkness and evil the penal judgments, through which light
and peace, or salvation, break forth for the people of God and the
nations generally. But as the prophecy concerning Cyrus closes with this
self-assertion of Jehovah, it is unquestionably a natural supposition
that there is also a contrast implied to the dualistic system of
Zarathustra, which divided the one nature of the Deity into two opposing
powers (see Windischmann, Zoroastrische Studien, p. 135). The
declaration is so bold, that Marcion appealed to this passage as a proof
that the God of the Old Testament was a different being from the God of
the New, and not the God of goodness only. The Valentinians and other
gnostics also regarded the words "There is no God beside me" in Isaiah,
as deceptive words of the Demiurugs. The early church met them with
Tertullian's reply, "de his creator profitetur malis quae congruunt
judici," and also made use of this self-attestation of the God of
revelation as a weapon with which to attack Manicheesism. The meaning of
the words is not exhausted by those who content themselves with the
assertion, that by the evil (or darkness) we are not to understand the
evil of guilt (malum culpae), but the evil of punishment (malum paenae).
Undoubtedly, evil as an act is not the direct working of God, but the
spontaneous work of a creature endowed with freedom. At the same time,
evil, as well as good, has in this sense its origin in God - that He
combines within Himself the first principles of love and wrath, the
possibility of evil, the self-punishment of evil, and therefore the
consciousness of guilt as well as the evil of punishment in the broadest
sense. When the apostle celebrates the glory of free grace in [Rom
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011.md)., he stands on that giddy height,
to which few are able to follow him without falling headlong into the
false conclusions of a decretum absolutum, and the denial of all
creaturely freedom.

[Isaiah 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 45:8</span></span>

In the prospect of this ultimate and saving purpose of the mission of
Cyrus, viz., the redemption of Israel and the conversion of the heathen,
heaven and earth are now summoned to bring forth and pour down spiritual
blessings in heavenly gifts, according to the will and in the power of
Jehovah, who has in view a new spiritual creation. "Cause to trickle
down, ye heavens above, and let the blue sky rain down righteousness;
let the earth open, and let salvation blossom, and righteousness; let
them sprout together: I Jehovah have created it." What the heavens are
to cause to trickle down, follows as the object to יזּלוּ. And what is
to flower when the earth opens (pâthach as in [Psa
106:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#017.md); compare aprilis and the
Neo-Greek anoixis, spring), is salvation and righteousness. But tzedek
(righteousness) is immediately afterwards the object of a new verb; so
that וּצדקה ישׁע, which are thought of as combined, as the word יחד
(together) shows, are uncoupled in the actual expression. Knobel
expresses a different opinion, and assumes that ישׁע is regarded as a
collective noun, and therefore construed with a plural, like אמרּה in
[Psa 119:103](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103.md), and חמדה in [Hag
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007). But the use of yachad (together.md)
favours the other interpretation. The suffix of בּראתיו points to this
fulness of righteousness and salvation. It is a creation of Jehovah
Himself. Heaven and earth, when co-operating to effect this, are endowed
with their capacity through Him from whom cometh every good and perfect
gift, and obey now, as at the first, His creative fiat. This "rorate
caeli desuper et nubes pluant justum," as the Vulgate renders it, is
justly regarded as an old advent cry.

[Isaiah 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 45:9</span></span>

The promise is now continued in the third strophe ([Isa
45:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009).md), and increases more and more
in the distinctness of its terms; but just as in [Isa
29:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015.md), it opens with a reproof of
that pusillanimity ([Isa 40:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#027.md); cf.,
[Isa 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013.md); [Isa
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024.md); [Isa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003).md), which goes so far to complain
of the ways of Jehovah. "Woe to him that quarreleth with his Maker - a
pot among the pots of earthenware? Can the clay indeed say to him that
shapeth it, What makest thou? and thy work, He hath no hands? Woe to him
that saith to his father, What begettest thou? and to the woman, What
bringest thou forth?" The comparison drawn between a man as the work of
God and the clay-work of a potter suggested itself all the more
naturally, inasmuch as the same word yootseer was applied to God as
Creator, and also to a potter (figulus). The word cheres signifies
either a sherd, or fragment of earthenware ([Isa
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014).md), or an earthenware vessel ([Jer
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md); [Pro
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#023).md). In the passage before us,
where the point of comparison is not the fragmentary condition, but the
earthen character of the material ()'adâmâh), the latter is intended:
the man, who complains of God, is nothing but a vessel of clay, and,
more than that, a perishable vessel among many others of the very same
kind.

(Note: The Septuagint reads shin for sin in both instances, and
introduces here the very unsuitable thought already contained in [Isa
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#024.md), "Shall the ploughman plough the
land the whole day?")

The questions which follow are meant to show the folly of this
complaining. Can it possibly occur to the clay to raise a complaint
against him who has it in hand, that he has formed it in such and such a
manner, or for such and such a purpose (compare [Rom
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020), "Why hast thou made me thus".md)?
To the words "or thy work" we must supply num dicet (shall it say);
pō‛al is a manufacture, as in [Isa
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#031.md). The question is addressed to the
maker, as those in [Isa 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#025.md) are to
the husbandman: Can the thing made by thee, O man, possibly say in a
contemptuous tone, "He has no hands?" - a supposition the ridiculous
absurdity of which condemns it at once; and yet it is a very suitable
analogy to the conduct of the man who complains of God. In [Isa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#010.md) a woe is denounced upon those
who resemble a man who should say to his own father, What children dost
thou beget? or to a wife, What dost thou bring forth? (techı̄lı̄n an
emphatic, and for the most part pausal, fut. parag., as in [Rut
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#008.md); [Rut
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#018).md). This would be the rudest and
most revolting attack upon an inviolably tender and private relation;
and yet Israel does this when it makes the hidden providential
government of its God the object of expostulation.

[Isaiah 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 45:11</span></span>

After this double woe, which is expressed in general terms, but the
application of which is easily made, the words of Jehovah are directly
addressed to the presumptuous criticizers. [Isa
45:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011.md) "Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy
One of Israel, and its Maker, Ask me what is to come; let my sons and
the work of my hands be committed to me!" The names by which He calls
Himself express his absolute blamelessness, and His absolute right of
supremacy over Israel. שׁאלוּני is an imperative, like שׁמעוּני in [Gen
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#008.md); the third person would be
written שׁאלוּני. The meaning is: If ye would have any information or
satisfaction concerning the future ("things to come," [Isa
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023.md); [Isa
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007).md), about which ye can neither know
nor determine anything of yourselves, inquire of me. צוּה with an
accusative of the person, and על of the thing, signifies to commit
anything to the care of another ([Ch1
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#012).md). The fault-finders in Israel
were to leave the people of whom Jehovah was the Maker (a retrospective
allusion to [Isa 45:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#010.md) and [Isa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009).md), in the hands of Him who has
created everything, and on whom everything depends. [Isa
45:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#012.md) "I, I have made the earth, and
created men upon it; I, my hands have stretched out the heavens, and all
their host have I called forth." ידי אני, according to Ges. 121, 3, is
equivalent to my hands, and mine alone - a similar arrangement of words
to those in [Gen 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027.md); [Ch2
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#010.md); [Ecc
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015.md). Hitzig is wrong in his
rendering, "all their host do I command." That of Ewald is the correct
one, "did I appoint;" for tsivvâsh, followed by an accusative of the
person, means to give a definite order or command to any one, the
command in this case being the order to come into actual existence (=
esse jussi, cf., [Psa 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 45:13</span></span>

He who created all things, and called all things into existence, had
also raised up this Cyrus, whose victorious career had increased the
anxieties and fears of the exiles, instead of leading them to lift up
their heads, because their redemption was drawing nigh. "I, I have
raised him up in righteousness, and all his ways shall I make smooth: He
will build my city, and release my banished ones, not for price nor for
reward, saith Jehovah of hosts." All the anxieties of the exiles are
calmed by the words "in righteousness," which trace back the revolutions
that Cyrus was causing to the righteousness of Jehovah, i.e., to His
interposition, which was determined by love alone, and tended directly
to the salvation of His people, and in reality to that of all nations.
And they are fully quieted by the promise, which is now expressed in the
clearest and most unequivocal words, that Cyrus would build up Jerusalem
again, and set the captivity free (gâlūth, as in [Isa
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004).md), and that without redemption
with money ([Isa 52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003).md) - a clear proof
that Jehovah had not only raised up Cyrus himself, but had put his
spirit within him, i.e., had stirred up within him the resolution to do
this (see the conclusion to the books of Chronicles, and the
introduction to that of Ezra). This closes the first half of our sixth
prophecy.

[Isaiah 45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 45:14</span></span>

The second half is uttered in the prospect, that the judgment which
Cyrus brings upon the nations will prepare the way for the overthrow of
heathenism, and the universal acknowledgment of the God of Israel. The
heathen submit, as the first strophe or group of vv. ([Isa
45:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014).md) affirms, to the congregation
and its God; the idolatrous are converted, whilst Israel is for ever
redeemed. With the prospect of the release of the exiles, there is
associated in the prophet's perspective the prospect of an expansion of
the restored church, through the entrance of "the fulness of the
Gentiles." "Thus saith Jehovah, The productions of Egypt, and gain of
Ethiopia, and the Sabaeans, men of tall stature, will come over to thee,
and belong to thee: they will come after thee; in chains they will come
over, and cast themselves down to thee; they pray to thee, Surely God is
in thee, and there is none else; no Deity at all." Assuming that יעברוּ
has the same meaning in both cases, the prophet's meaning appears to be,
that the Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Meroites (see [Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003).md), who had been enslaved by the
imperial power of Persia, would enter the miraculously emancipated
congregation of Israel (Ewald). But if they were thought of as in a
state of subjugation to the imperial power of Asia, who could the
promise be at the same time held out that their riches would pass over
into the possession of the church? And yet, on the other hand, the
chains in which they come over cannot be regarded, at least in this
connection, where such emphasis is laid upon the voluntary character of
the surrender, as placed upon them by Israel itself (as in [Isa
60:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011.md) and [Psa
149:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008).md). We must therefore suppose that
they put chains upon themselves voluntarily, and of their own accord,
and thus offer themselves spontaneously to the church, to be henceforth
its subjects and slaves. Egypt, Ethiopia, and Saba are the nations that
we meet with in other passages, where the haereditas gentium is promised
to the church, and generally in connection with Tyre (vid., [Psa
68:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#032.md); [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010.md); compare [Isa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007.md); [Isa
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#016.md)., [Isa
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018).md). Whilst the labour of Egypt
(i.e., the productions of its labour) and the trade of Ethiopia (i.e.,
the riches acquired by trade) are mentioned; in the case of Saba the
prophecy looks at the tall and handsome tribe itself, a tribe which
Agatharchides describes as having σώματα ἀξιολογώτερα. These would place
themselves at the service of the church with their invincible strength.
The voluntary character of the surrender is pointed out, not only in the
expression "they will come over," but also in the confession with which
this is accompanied. In other cases the words hithpallēl 'el are only
used of prayer to God and idols; but here it is to the church that
prayer is offered. In the prophet's view, Jehovah and His church are
inseparably one (compare [Co1 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012.md),
where "Christ" stands for the church as one body, consisting of both
head and members; also the use of the word "worship" in [Rev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md), which has all the ring of a
passage taken from Isaiah). אך is used here in its primary affirmative
sense, as in [Psa 58:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#011.md). There can be
no doubt that Paul had this passage of Isaiah in his mind when writing
[Co1 14:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024.md), ἀπαγγέλλων ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς
ὄντως ἐν ὑμῖν ἐστί, or, according to a better arrangement of the words,
ὅτι ὄντως (= אך) ὁ Θεὸς ἐν ὑμῖν ἐστίν. 'Ephes does not signify praeter
(as a synonym of בּלעדי, זוּלתי) either here or anywhere else, but is a
substantive used with a verbal force, which stands in the same relation
to אין as "there is not at all (absolutely not)" to "there is not;"
compare [Isa 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md); [Isa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#006.md); [Isa
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#009.md), also [Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md) (derivative passage, [Kg2
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026).md), and [Amo
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010.md); [Sa2
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#003.md); vid., [Isa
47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008.md).

[Isaiah 45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 45:15</span></span>

What follows in [Isa 45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015.md) is not a
continuation of the words of the Gentiles, but a response of the church
to their confession. The nations that have been idolatrous till now,
bend in humble spontaneous worship before the church and its God; and at
the sight of this, the church, from whose soul the prophet is speaking,
bursts out into an exclamation of reverential amazement. "Verily Thou
art a mysterious God, Thou God of Israel, Thou Savour." Literally, a God
who hides Himself (mistattēr: the resemblance to μυστηρ-ιώδης is quite
an accidental one; the ē is retained in the participle even in pause).
The meaning is, a God who guides with marvellous strangeness the history
of the nations of the earth, and by secret ways, which human eyes can
never discern, conducts all to a glorious issue. The exclamation in [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md), "O the depth of the riches,"
etc., is a similar one.

[Isaiah 45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 45:16</span></span>

The way in which this God who hides Himself is ultimately revealed as
the God of salvation, is then pointed out in [Isa
45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016.md), [Isa
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017.md) : "They are put to shame, and
also confounded, all of them; they go away into confusion together, the
forgers of idols. Israel is redeemed by Jehovah with everlasting
redemption: ye are not put to shame nor confounded to everlasting
eternities." The perfects are expressive of the ideal past. Jehovah
shows Himself as a Savour by the fact, that whereas the makers of idols
perish, Israel is redeemed an everlasting redemption (acc. obj. as in
[Isa 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006.md); [Isa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#017); Ges. 138, 1, Anm. 1.md), i.e., so
that its redemption is one that lasts for aeons (αἰωνία λύτρωσις, [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012).md) - observe that teshū‛âh does not
literally signify redemption or rescue, but transfer into a state of
wide expanse, i.e., of freedom and happiness. The plural ‛ōlâmı̄m
(eternities = αἰῶνες aeua) belongs, according to Knobel, to the later
period of the language; but it is met with as early as in old Asaphite
psalms ([Psa 77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006).md). When the further
promise is added, Ye shall not be put to shame, etc., this clearly
shows, what is also certain on other grounds - namely, that the
redemption is not thought of merely as an outward and bodily one, but
also as inward and spiritual, and indeed (in accordance with the
prophetic blending of the end of the captivity with the end of all
things) as a final one. Israel will never bring upon itself again such a
penal judgment as that of the captivity by falling away from God; that
is to say, its state of sin will end with its state of punishment, even
עב עד־עולמי, i.e., since עד has no plural, εἰς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων.

[Isaiah 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 45:18</span></span>

The second and last strophe of this prophecy commences with [Isa
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018.md). By the fulfilment of the
promise thus openly proclaimed, those of the heathen who have been saved
from the judgment will recognise Jehovah as the only God; and the
irresistible will of Jehovah, that all mankind should worship Him, be
carried out. The promise cannot remain unfulfilled. "For thus saith
Jehovah, the creator of the heavens (He is the Deity), the former of the
earth, and its finisher; He has established it (He has not created it a
desert, He has formed it to be inhabited): I am Jehovah, and there is
none else. I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of
darkness; I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Into the desert seek ye
me! I Jehovah am speaking righteousness, proclaiming upright things."
The athnach properly divides [Isa
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018.md) in half. [Isa
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018.md) describes the speaker, and what
He says commences in [Isa 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018.md). The
first parenthesis affirms that Jehovah is God in the fullest and most
exclusive sense; the second that He has created the earth for man's
sake, not "as a desert" (tōhū: the lxx, Targum, and Jerome render this
with less accuracy, non in vanum), i.e., not to be and continue to be a
desert, but to be inhabited. Even in [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md), chaos is not described as of
God's creation, because (whatever may be men's opinions concerning it in
other respects) the creative activity of God merely made use of this as
a starting-point, and because, although it did not come into existence
without God, it was at any rate not desired by God for its own sake. The
words of Jehovah commence, then, with the assertion that Jehovah is the
absolute One; and from this two thoughts branch off: (1.) The first is,
that the prophecy which emanates from Him is an affair of light, no
black art, but essentially different from heathen soothsaying. By "a
dark place of the earth" we are to understand, according to [Psa
139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015.md), the interior of the earth, and
according to [Job 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md), Hades; the
intention being to point out the contrast between the prophecies of
Jehovah and the heathen cave-oracles and spirit-voices of the
necromancists, which seemed to rise up from the interior of the earth
(see [Isa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#004.md); [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md); [Isa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004)). (2..md) The second thought is,
that the very same love of Jehovah, which has already been displayed in
the creation, attests itself in His relation to Israel, which He has not
directed to Himself "into the desert" (tōhū), just as He did not create
the earth a tōhū. Meier and Knobel suppose that baqshūnı̄, which is
written here, according to a well-supported reading, with Koph raphatum
(whereas in other cases the dagesh is generally retained, particularly
in the imperative of biqqēsh), refers to seeking for disclosures as to
the future; but the word דרשׁוּני would be used for this, as in [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md). He has not said, "Seek ye me (as
in [Zep 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003).md) into the desert," i.e.,
without the prospect of meeting with any return for your pains. On the
contrary, He has attached promises to the seeking of Himself, which
cannot remain unfulfilled, for He is "one speaking righteousness,
declaring things that are right;" i.e., when He promises, He follows out
the rule of His purpose and of His plan of salvation, and the impulse of
sincere desire for their good, and love which is ever true to itself.
The present word of prophecy points to the fulfilment of these promises.

[Isaiah 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 45:20</span></span>

The salvation of Israel, foretold and realized by Jehovah, becomes at
the same time the salvation of the heathen world. "Assemble yourselves
and come; draw near together, ye escaped of the heathen! Irrational are
they who burden themselves with the wood of their idol, and pray to a
god that bringeth no salvation. Make known, and cause to draw near; yea,
let them take counsel together: Who has made such things known from the
olden time, proclaimed it long ago? have not I, Jehovah? and there is no
Deity beside me; a God just, and bringing salvation: there is not
without me!" The fulness of the Gentiles, which enters into the kingdom
of God, is a remnant of the whole mass of the heathen: for salvation
comes through judgment; and it is in the midst of great calamities that
the work of that heathen mission is accomplished, which is represented
in these prophecies on the one hand as the mission of Cyrus, and on the
other hand as the mission of Jehovah and His servant. Hence this summons
to listen to the self-assertion of the God of revelation, is addressed
to the escaped of the heathen, who are not therefore the converted, but
those who are susceptible of salvation, and therefore spared. By "the
heathen" (haggōyı̄m) Knobel understands the allies and auxiliaries of the
Babylonians, whom Cyrus put to flight (according to the Cyropaedia)
before his Lydian campaign. But this is only an example of that
exaggerated desire to turn everything into history, which not only
prevented his seeing the poetry of the form, but obscured the fact that
prophecy is both human and divine. For the future was foreshortened to
the telescopic glance of the prophet, so that he could not see it in all
its length and breadth. He saw in one mass what history afterwards
unrolled; and then behind the present he could just see as it were the
summit of the end, although a long eventful way still lay between the
two. Accordingly, our prophet here takes his stand not at the close of
any particular victory of Cyrus, but at the close of all his victories;
and, in his view, these terminate the whole series of catastrophes,
which are outlived by a remnant of the heathen, who are converted to
Jehovah, and thus complete the final glory of the restored people of
God. Throughout the whole of these prophecies we see immediately behind
the historical foreground this eschatological background lifting up its
head. The heathen who have been preserved will assemble together; and
from the fact that Jehovah proves Himself the sole foreteller of the
events that are now unfolding themselves, they will be brought to the
conviction that He is the only God. The hithpael hithnaggēsh does not
occur anywhere else. On the absolute ידע לא, see at [Isa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009.md) (cf., [Isa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003).md). To the verb haggı̄shū we must
supply, as in [Isa 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022.md), according to
the same expression in [Isa 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021.md),
עצּמתיכם (your proofs). "This" refers to the fall of Babylon and
redemption of Israel - salvation breaking through judgment. On mē'âz,
from the olden time, compare [Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008.md). God is "a just God and a
Saviour," as a being who acts most stringently according to the demands
of His holiness, and wherever His wrath is not wickedly provoked, sets
in motion His loving will, which is ever concerned to secure the
salvation of men.

[Isaiah 45:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 45:22</span></span>

It is in accordance with this holy loving will that the cry is published
in [Isa 45:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#022.md) : "Turn unto me, and be
ye saved, all ye ends of the earth; for I am God, and none else." The
first imperative is hortatory, the second promising (cf., [Isa
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#016.md) and [Isa
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009).md): Jehovah desires both, viz., the
conversion of all men to Himself; and through this their salvation, ad
this His gracious will, which extends to all mankind, will not rest till
its object has been fully accomplished. [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md) "By myself have I sworn, a word
has gone out of a mouth of righteousness, and will not return, That to
me every knee shall bend, every tongue swear." Swearing by Himself (see
[Gen 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016).md), God pledges what He
swears with His own life (compare [Rom
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011), "as I live".md). Parallel to
נשׁבּעתּי בּי is the clause ישׁוּב ולא דּבר צדק מפּי יצא. Here
Rosenmller connects דבר צדקה together as if with a hyphen, in the sense
of a truth-word (Jerome, justitiae verbum). But this is grammatically
impossible, since it would require צדקה דּבר; moreover, it is opposed
both to the accents, and to the dagesh in the Daleth. Hitzig's rendering
is a better one: "Truth (lxx δικαιοσύνη), a word that does not return,"
- the latter being taken as an explanatory permutative; but in that case
we should require לא for ולא, and tsedâqâh is not used in the sense of
truth anywhere else (compare tsaddı̄q, however, in [Isa
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026).md). On the other hand, צדקה might
be equivalent to בצדקה "in righteousness;" cf., [Isa
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025), חמה = בּהמה.md), if it were not
incomparably more natural to connect together צדקה מפי as a genitive
construction; though not in the sense in which הגבורה מפי is used in
post-biblical writings - namely, as equivalent to "out of the mouth of
God" (see Buxtorf, Lex. Chald. Col. 385) - but rather in this way, that
the mouth of God is described attributively as regulated in its words by
His holy will (as "speaking righteousness, [Isa
45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019).md). A word has gone forth from
this mouth of righteousness; and after it has once gone forth, it does
not return without accomplishing its object ([Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011).md). What follows is not so much a
promising prediction (that every knee will bend to me), as a definitive
declaration of will (that it shall or must bend to me). According to
[Isa 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md); [Isa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005.md), "to me" is to be regarded as
carried forward, and so to be supplied after "shall swear" (the
Septuagint rendering, ὀμεῖται @85 τὸν Θεόν, is false; that of Paul in
[Rom 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011.md), ἐξομολογήσεται τῷ Θεῷ, is
correct; and in this case, as in others also, the Cod. Al. of the Sept.
has been corrected from the New Testament quotations).

[Isaiah 45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 45:24</span></span>

This bending of the knee, this confession as an oath of homage, will be
no forced one. [Isa 45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md) "Only in
Jehovah, do men say of me, is fulness of righteousness and strength;
they come to Him, and all that were incensed against Him are put to
shame." The parenthetical insertion of אמר לי ל, with reference to, as
in [Isa 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007.md); [Isa
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026.md), [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028).md) is the same as in [Psa
119:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#057.md). אך has a restrictive sense
here, which springs out of the affirmative (cf., [Psa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md); [Psa
73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001).md), just as, in the case of raq,
the affirmative grows out of the primary restrictive sense. The
"righteousness" is abounding (superabundant) righteousness ([Rom
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015)..md). עז is the strength of
sanctification, and of the conquest of the world. The subject to יבוא
(which is not to be changed, according to the Masora, into the more
natural יבאּוּ, as it is by the lxx, Syr., and Vulg.) is, whoever has
seen what man has in Jehovah, and made confession of this; such a man
does not rest till he has altogether come over to Jehovah, whereas all
His enemies are put to shame. They separate themselves irretrievably
from the men who serve Him, the restoration of whom is His direct will,
and the goal of the history of salvation. [Isa
45:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#025.md) "In Jehovah all the seed of
Israel shall become righteous, and shall glory." Ruetschi has very
properly observed on this verse, that the reference is to the Israel of
God out of all the human race, i.e., the church of the believers in
Israel expanded by the addition of the heathen; which church is now
righteous, i.e., reconciled and renewed by Jehovah, and glories in Him,
because by grace it is what it is.

This brings the sixth prophecy to a close. Its five strophes commence
with "Thus saith the Lord;" at the same time, the fifth strophe has two
"woes" (hoi) before this, as the ground upon which it rests.
