### [2 Chronicles Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 16:1</span></span>

War with Baasha, and the weakness of Asa's faith. The end of his reign.
- [Ch2 16:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001.md). Baasha's invasion of
Judah, and Asa's prayer for help to the king of Syria. The statement,
"In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha the king of Israel
came up against Judah," is inaccurate, or rather cannot possibly be
correct; for, according to [Kg1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#008.md),
[Kg1 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#010.md), Baasha died in the
twenty-sixth year of Asa's reign, and his successor Elah was murdered by
Zimri in the second year of his reign, i.e., in the twenty-seventh year
of Asa. The older commentators, for the most part, accepted the
conjecture that the thirty-fifth year (in [Ch2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019).md) is to be reckoned from the
commencement of the kingdom of Judah; and consequently, since Asa became
king in the twentieth year of the kingdom of Judah, that Baasha's
invasion occurred in the sixteenth year of his reign, and that the land
had enjoyed peace till his fifteenth year; cf. Ramb. ad h. l.; des
Vignoles, Chronol. i. p. 299. This is in substance correct; but the
statement, "in the thirty-sixth year of Asa's kingship," cannot re
reconciled with it. For even if we suppose that the author of the
Chronicle derived his information from an authority which reckoned from
the rise of the kingdom of Judah, yet it could not have been said on
that authority, אסא למלכוּת. This only the author of the Chronicle can
have written; but then he cannot also have taken over the statement, "in
the thirty-sixth year," unaltered from his authority into his book.
There remains therefore no alternative but to regard the text as
erroneous - the letters ל (30) and י (10), which are somewhat similar in
the ancient Hebrew characters, having been interchanged by a copyist;
and hence the numbers 35 and 36 have arisen out of the original 15 and
16. By this alteration all difficulties are removed, and all the
statements of the Chronicle as to Asa's reign are harmonized. During the
first ten years there was peace ([Ch2
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001).md); thereafter, in the eleventh
year, the inroad of the Cushites; and after the victory over them there
was the continuation of the Cultus reform, and rest until the fifteenth
year, in which the renewal of the covenant took place ([Ch2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019.md), cf. with [Ch2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#010).md); and in the sixteenth year the
war with Baasha arose.

(Note: Movers, S. 255ff., and Then. on 1 Kings 15, launch out into
arbitrary hypotheses, founded in both cases upon the erroneous
presumption that the author of the Chronicle copied our canonical books
of Kings - they being his authority-partly misunderstanding and partly
altering them.)

The account of this war in [Ch2 16:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001.md)
agrees with that in [Kg1 15:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#017.md)
almost literally, and has been commented upon in the remarks on 1 Kings
15. In [Ch2 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#002.md) the author of the
Chronicle has mentioned only the main things. Abel-maim, i.e., Abel in
the Water ([Ch2 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#004).md), is only another
name for Abel-Beth-Maachah (Kings); see on [Sa2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#014.md). In the same verse נפתּלי ערי
כּל־מסכּנות ואת is surprising, "and all magazines (or stores) of the
cities of Naphtali," instead of נפתּלי כּל־ארץ על כּל־כּנּרות את, "all
Kinneroth, together with all the land of Naphtali" (Kings). Then. and
Berth. think ערי מסכנות has arisen out of ארץ and כנרות by a
misconception of the reading; while Gesen., Dietr. in Lex. sub voce
כּנּרות, conjecture that in [Kg1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020.md)
מסכּנות should be read instead of כּנּרות. Should the difference
actually be the result only of a misconception, then the latter
conjecture would have much more in its favour than the first. But it is
a more probable solution of the difficulty that the text of the
Chronicle is a translation of the unusual and, especially on account of
the כּל־ארץ נ על, scarcely intelligible כּל־כּנּרות. כּנּרות is the
designation of the very fertile district on the west side of the Sea of
Kinnereth, i.e., Gennesaret, after which a city also was called כּנּרת
(see on [Jos 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035).md), and which, on
account of its fertility, might be called the granary of the tribal
domain of Naphtali. But the smiting of a district can only be a
devastation of it, - a plundering and destruction of its produce, both
in stores and elsewhere. With this idea the author of the Chronicle,
instead of the district Kinnereth, the name of which had perhaps become
obsolete in his time, speaks of the מסכּנות, the magazines or stores, of
the cities of Naphtali. In [Ch2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#005.md),
too, we cannot hold the addition את־מלאכתּו ויּשׁבּת, "he caused his
work to rest," as Berth. does, for an interpretation of the original
reading, בּתרצה ויּשׁב (Kings), it having become illegible: it is rather
a free rendering of the thought that Baasha abandoned his attempt upon
Judah.

[2 Chronicles 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 16:6</span></span>

In regard to the building of Mizpah, it is casually remarked in [Jer
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#009.md) that Asa had there built a
cistern.

[2 Chronicles 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 16:7</span></span>

The rebuke of the prophet Hanani, and Asa's crime. - [Ch2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007.md). The prophet Hanani is met with
only here. Jehu, the son of Hanani, who announced to Baasha the ruin of
his house ([Kg1 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001).md), and who
reappears under Jehoshaphat ([Ch2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002).md), was without doubt his son.
Hanani said to King Asa, "Because thou hast relied on the king of Aram,
and not upon Jahve thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Aram
escaped out of thy hand." Berth. has correctly given the meaning thus:
"that Asa, if he had relied upon God, would have conquered not only the
host of Baasha, but also the host of the king of Damascus, if he had, as
was to be feared, in accordance with his league with Baasha ([Ch2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#003).md), in common with Israel, made an
attack upon the kingdom of Judah." To confirm this statement, the
prophet points to the victory over the great army of the Cushites, which
Asa had won by his trust in God the Lord. With the Cushites Hanani names
also פּרשׁים, Libyans (cf. [Ch2 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003).md),
and besides רכב, the war-chariots, also פּרשׁים osla ,sto, horsemen, in
order to portray the enemy rhetorically, while in the historical
narrative only the immense number of warriors and the multitude of the
chariots is spoken of.

[2 Chronicles 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 16:9</span></span>

"For Jahve, His eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show
Himself strong with those whose heart is devoted to Him;" i.e., for
Jahve, who looks forth over all the earth, uses every opportunity
wonderfully to succour those who are piously devoted to Him. עם התחזק,
to help mightily, as in [Ch1 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#010.md).
אליו שׁלם עם־לבבם is a relative sentence without the relative אשׁר with
עם; cf. [Ch1 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012.md). "Thou hast done
foolishly, therefore," scil. because thou hast set thy trust upon men
instead of upon Jahve, "for from henceforth there shall be wars to thee"
(thou shalt have war). In these words the prophet does not announce to
Asa definite wars, but only expresses the general idea that Asa by his
godless policy would bring only wars (מלחמות in indefinite
universality), not peace, to the kingdom. History confirms the truth of
this announcement, although we have no record of any other wars which
broke out under Asa.

[2 Chronicles 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 16:10</span></span>

This sharp speech so angered the king, that he caused the seer to be set
in the stock-house. המּהשפכת בּית, properly, house of stocks. מהפּכת,
twisting, is an instrument of torture, a stock, by which the body was
forced into an unnatural twisted position, the victim perhaps being bent
double, with the hands and feet fastened together: cf. [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md); [Jer
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026.md); and [Act
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#024.md), ἔβαλεν εἰς τὴν φυλακὴ̀ν καὶ τοὺς
πόδας ἠσφαλίσατο αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ ξύλον. "For in wrath against him (scil. he
did it) because of this thing, and Asa crushed some of the people at
this time." Clearly Hanani's speech, and still more Asa's harsh
treatment of the seer, caused great discontent among the people, at
least in the upper classes, so that the king felt himself compelled to
use force against them. רצץ, to break or crush, is frequently used along
with עשׁק ([Deu 28:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033.md); [Sa1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003), etc..md), and signifies to suppress
with violence. Asa had indeed well deserved the censure, Thou hast dealt
foolishly. His folly consisted in this, that in order to get help
against Baasha's attack, he had had recourse to a means which must
become dangerous to him and to his kingdom; for it was not difficult to
foresee that the Syrian king Benhadad would turn the superiority to
Israel which he had gained against Judah itself. But in order to
estimate rightly Asa's conduct, we must consider that it was perhaps an
easier thing, in human estimation, to conquer the innumerable multitudes
of the Ethiopian hordes than the united forces of the kings of Israel
and Syria; and that, notwithstanding the victory over the Ethiopians,
yet Asa's army may have been very considerably weakened by that war. But
these circumstances are not sufficient to justify Asa. Since he had so
manifestly had the help of the Lord in the war against the Cushites, it
was at bottom mainly weakness of faith, or want of full trust in the
omnipotence of the Lord, which caused him to seek the help of the enemy
of God's people, the king of Syria, instead of that of the Almighty God,
and to make flesh his arm; and for this he was justly censured by the
prophet.

[2 Chronicles 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 16:11</span></span>

The end of Asa's reign; cf. [Kg1
15:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023.md). - On [Ch2
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#011.md), cf. the Introduction.

[Ch2 16:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012.md)

In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa became diseased in his feet,
and that in a high degree. The words חיו עד־למעלה are a circumstantial
clause: to a high degree was his sickness. "And also in his sickness (as
in the war against Baasha) he sought not Jahve, but turned to the
physicians." דּרשׁ is primarily construed with the accus., as usually in
connection with יהוה or אלהים, to seek God, to come before Him with
prayer and supplication; then with בּ, as usually of an oracle, or
seeking help of idols (cf. [Sa1 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007.md);
[Kg2 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002.md).; [Ch1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#014).md), and so here of superstitious
trust in the physicians. Consequently it is not the mere inquiring of
the physicians which is here censured, but only the godless manner in
which Asa trusted in the physicians.

[Ch2 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014.md)

The Chronicle gives a more exact account of Asa's burial than [Kg1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#024.md). He was buried in the city of
David; not in the general tomb of the kings, however, but in a tomb
which he had caused to be prepared for himself in that place. And they
laid him upon the bed, which had been filled with spices (בּשׂמים, see
[Exo 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023).md), and those of various
kinds, mixed for an anointing mixture, prepared. זנים from זן, kind,
species; וּזנים, et varia quidem. מרקּח in Piel only here, properly
spiced, from רקח, to spice, usually to compound an unguent of various
spices. מרקחת, the compounding of ointment; so also [Ch1
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#030.md), where it is usually translated
by unguent. מעשׂה, work, manufacture, is a shortened terminus technicus
for רוקח מעשׂה, manufacture of the ointment-compounder (cf. [Exo
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025.md), [Exo
30:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#035).md), and the conjecture that רוקח
has been dropped out of the text by mistake is unnecessary. "And they
kindled for him a great, very great burning," cf. [Ch2
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#019.md) and [Jer
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#005.md), whence we gather that the
kindling of a burning, i.e., the burning of odorous spices, was
customary at the burials of kings. Here it is only remarked that at
Asa's funeral an extraordinary quantity of spices was burnt. A burning
of the corpse, or of the bed or clothes of the dead, is not to be
thought of here: the Israelites were in the habit of burying their dead,
not of burning them. That occurred only in extraordinary
circumstances-as, for example, in the case of the bodies of Saul and his
sons; see on [Sa1 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#012.md). The kindling
and burning of spices at the solemn funerals of persons of princely
rank, on the other hand, occurred also among other nations, e.g., among
the Romans; cf. Plinii hist. nat. xii. 18, and M. Geier, de luctu Hebr.
c. 6.
