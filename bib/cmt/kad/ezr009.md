Ezra's Proceedings in the Severance of the Strange Women from the
Congregation of Israel - [Ezr 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001)

When Ezra, some time after his arrival, was in the temple at Jerusalem,
the princes of the people informed him that the Israelites had mingled
themselves by marriage with the people of the lands ([Ezr
9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001)). Deeply moved by this
communication, he sat astonished till the time of the evening sacrifice,
while all who feared God's word assembled about him ([Ezr
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003), [Ezr
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#004)). At the evening sacrifice he fell
upon his knees and prayed, making a touching confession of sin before
God, in the name of the congregation ([Ezr
9:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#005)). During this prayer many were
gathered around him weeping, and Shecaniah coming forth from their
midst, acknowledged that transgressions of the congregation, and
declared that they would make a covenant with God to put away all the
strange wives ([Ezr 10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001)). After
making the princes, the priests, and Levites take an oath that they
would do according to the declaration thus made, Ezra left the temple
and retired to the chamber of Johanan, to fast and mourn over the
transgression of those who had returned from captivity ([Ezr
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#005), [Ezr
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#006)). An assembly at Jerusalem was
then proclaimed, and those who should not attend it were threatened with
heavy penalties ([Ezr 10:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#007)). At this
assembly Ezra reproved the people for their transgression, and called
upon them to separate themselves from the people of the countries, and
from the strange wives ([Ezr 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#010),
[Ezr 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#011)); upon which the assembly
resolved to appoint a commission to investigate and decide upon
individual cases. In spite of the opposition of some, this proposal was
accepted, and the commission named ([Ezr
10:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#012)), which held its sittings
from the first day of the tenth month, and made an end of its
investigations into all cases brought before it by the close of the
year. Then follows the list of those who had taken strange wives
(10:18-44), with which the book concludes.

[Ezra 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 9:1</span></span>

Information given of the intermingling of Israel with the heathen
nations of the land by marriage ([Ezr
9:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001)), and Ezra's prayer and
confession ([Ezr 9:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#005)). - [Ezr
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001), [Ezr
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#002). "When this was done, the princes
came to me, and said, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the
Levites, do not separate themselves from the people of the lands,
according to their abominations, (even) of the Canaanites; ... for they
have taken (wives) of their daughters for themselves and for their sons,
and the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of the lands."
What now follows is placed in close chronological sequence with what
precedes by the formula אלּה וּככלּות, at the time of the completion of
these things; comp. [Ch2 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001); [Ch2
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#029); [Ch2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001). אלּה are the things related [Ezr
8:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#033). Of these the delivery of the
gifts took place on the fourth day after Ezra's arrival at Jerusalem,
i.e., on the fourth or fifth day of the first month (comp. [Ezr
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#032), etc., with [Ezr
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009)). The sacrifices ([Ezr
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#035)) would undoubtedly be offered
immediately; and the royal orders would be transmitted to the satraps
and governors ([Ezr 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#036)) very soon
after. As soon, then, as Ezra received intelligence concerning the
illegal marriages, he took the matter in hand, so that all related ([Ezr
9:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003)) occurred on one day. The first
assemblage of the people with relation to this business was not,
however, held till the twentieth day of the ninth month ([Ezr
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#009)); while on the calling of this
meeting, appearance thereat was prescribed within three days, thus
leaving apparently an interval of nine whole months between Ezra 8 and
[Ezr 9:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001). Hence Bertheau
conjectures that the first proclamation of this assembly encountered
opposition, because certain influential personages were averse to the
further prosecution of this matter ([Ezr
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#015)). But though [Ezr
10:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#004) does not inform us what period
elapsed between the adoption of Shecaniah's proposal to Ezra, and the
proclamation for assembling the people at Jerusalem, the narrative does
not give the impression that this proclamation was delayed for months
through the opposition it met with. Besides, Ezra may have received the
information concerning the unlawful marriages, not during the month of
his arrival at Jerusalem, but some months later. We are not told whether
it was given immediately, or soon after the completion of the matters
mentioned [Ezr 8:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#033). The delivery
of the royal commands to the satraps and governors ([Ezr
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#036)) may have occupied weeks or
months, the question being not merely to transmit the king's decrees to
the said officials, but to come to such an understanding with them as
might secure their favour and goodwill in assisting the newly
established community, and supporting the house of God. The last
sentence ([Ezr 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#036)), "And they
furthered the people and the house of God," plainly shows that such an
understanding with the royal functionaries was effected, by transactions
which must have preceded what is related [Ezr
9:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001).

This matter having been arranged, and Ezra being now about to enter upon
the execution of his commission to inquire concerning Judah and
Jerusalem according to the law of his God ([Ezr
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012)), he received information of the
illegal marriages. While he was in the temple, the princes (השּׂרים, the
princes, are those who give the information, the article being used
e.g., like that in הפּליט, [Gen 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013))
came to him, saying: The people (viz., Israel, the priests, and the
Levites; the three classes of the Israelite community) do not separate
themselves from the people of the lands; comp. [Ezr
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#021). כּתעבתיהם, with respect to their
abominations, i.e., as Israel should have done with respect to the
abominations of these people. The ל to לכּנעני might be regarded as
introducing the enumeration of the different nations, and corresponding
with מעמּי; it is, however, more likely that it is used merely as a
periphrasis for the genitive, and subordinates the names to תּעבתיהם:
their, i.e., the Canaanites', etc., abominations, the suffix relating,
as e.g., at [Ezr 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012) and elsewhere,
to the names following. Give Canaanitish races are here named, as in
[Exo 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#005), with this difference, that
the Perizzites are here substituted for the Hivites, while in [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008); [Exo
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023), both are enumerated, making
six; to these are added in [Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001)
the Girgashites, making, generally speaking, seven nations. Ammonites,
Moabites, and Egyptians are here cited besides the Canaanitish races.
The non-severance of the Israelites from these nations consisted,
according to [Ezr 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#002), in the fact of
their having contracted marriages with them. In the law, indeed ([Exo
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#016); [Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003)), only marriages with Canaanitish
women were forbidden; but the reason of this prohibition, viz., that
Israel might not be seduced by them to idolatry, made its extension to
Moabites, Ammonites, and Egyptians necessary under existing
circumstances, if an effectual check was to be put to the relapse into
heathenism of the Israelitish community, now but just gathered out again
from among the Gentiles. For during the captivity idolaters of all
nations had settled in the depopulated country, and mingled with the
remnant of the Israelites left there. By "the people of the lands,"
however, we are not to understand, with J. H. Michaelis, remnants of the
races subjugated by Nebuchadnezzar and carried to Babylon, - who were
now, after seventy years, returning, as well as the Jews, to their
native lands under Cyrus; in support of which view Mich. incorrectly
refers to [Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009), etc. - but those
portions, both of the ancient Canaanitish races and of the Moabites and
Ammonites, who, escaping the sentence of captivity, remained in the
land. נשׂאוּ is naturally completed by נשׁים from the context; comp.
[Ezr 10:44](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#044); [Ch2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021), and other passages. The subject
of התערבוּ is the collective הקּדשׁ זרע, the holy seed, i.e., the
members of the nation called to holiness ([Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005)). The appellation is taken from
[Isa 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013), where the remnant of the
covenant people, preserved in the midst of judgments, and purified
thereby, is called a holy seed. The second part of [Ezr
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#002) contains an explanatory accessory
clause: and the hand of the princes and rulers hath been first in this
unfaithfulness (מעל, comp. [Lev 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015)),
i.e., the princes were the first to transgress; on the figurative
expression, comp. [Deu 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#010). סגנים is
an Old-Persian word naturalized in Hebrew, signifying commander,
prefect; but its etymology is not as yet satisfactorily ascertained: see
Delitzsch on [Isa 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025).

[Ezra 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 9:3</span></span>

This information threw Ezra into deep grief and moral consternation. The
tearing of the upper and under garments was a sign of heartfelt and
grievous affliction ([Jos 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#006)); see
remarks on [Lev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006). The plucking out
of (a portion of) the hair was the expression of violent wrath or moral
indignation, comp. [Neh 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#025), and is
not to be identified with the cutting off of the hair in mourning [Job
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#020)). "And sat down stunned;" משׁומם,
desolate, rigid, stunned, without motion. While he was sitting thus,
there were gathered unto him all who feared the word of God concerning
the transgression of those that had been carried away. חרד, trembling,
being terrified, generally construed with על or אל (e.g., [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002), [Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005)), but here with ב (like verbs of
embracing, believing), and meaning to believe with trembling in the word
which God had spoken concerning this מעל, i.e., thinking with terror of
the punishments which such faithless conduct towards a covenant God
involved.

[Ezra 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 9:5</span></span>

Ezra's prayer and confession for the congregation. - [Ezr
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#005) And at the time of the evening
sacrifice, I rose up from my mortification (תּענית, humiliation,
generally through fasting, here through sitting motionless in deep
affliction of soul), and rending my garment and my mantle. These words
contribute a second particular to קמתּי, and do not mean that Ezra arose
with his garments torn, but state that, on arising, he rent his
clothing, and therefore again manifested his sorrow in this manner. He
then fell on his knees, and spread out his hands to God (comp. [Kg1
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022)), to make a confession of the
heavy guilt of the congregation before God, and thus impressively to set
their sins before all who heard his prayer.

[Ezr 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#006)

9:6, etc. The train of thought in this prayer is as follows: I scarcely
dare to lift up my fact to God, through shame for the greatness of our
misdeeds ([Ezr 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#006)). From the days of
our fathers, God has sorely punished us for our sins by delivering us
into the power of our enemies; but has now again turned His pity towards
us, and revived us in the place of His sanctuary, through the favour of
the king of Persia ([Ezr 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007)). But we
have again transgressed His commands, with the keeping of which God has
connected our possession of the good land given unto us ([Ezr
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#010)). Should we then, after God has
spared us more than we through our trespasses have deserved, bring His
wrath upon us, till we are wholly consumed? God is just; He has
preserved us; but we stand before Him with heavy guilt upon us, such
guilt that we cannot endure God's presence ([Ezr
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013)). Ezra does not pray for the
pardon of their sin, for he desires only to bring the congregation to
the knowledge of the greatness of their transgression, and so to invite
them to do all that in them lies to atone for their guilt, and to
appease God's wrath.

"I am ashamed, and am covered with shame, to lift up my face to Thee, my
God." ונכלמתּי בּשׁתּי united, as in [Jer
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019), comp. [Isa
45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016), and other passages. נכלם, to be
covered with shame, is stronger than בּושׁ. "For our iniquities are
increased over our head," i.e., have grown above our head. ראשׁ למעלה,
to or over the head. למעלה serves to enhance the meaning of רבוּ, like
[Ch1 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#017). "And our guiltiness is
great, (reaching) unto the heavens;" comp. [Ch2
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009).

[Ezr 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007)

"Since the days of our fathers, have we, our kings, our priests, been
delivered into the hands of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to
captivity, to plunder, and to shame of face." The words from בּחרב
onwards serve to explain what is meant by being delivered into the hand
of strange kings. On the expression פּנים בּשׁת, comp. [Dan
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007), etc., [Ch2
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021). הזּה כּהיּום, as it is this
day, as is to-day the case; see remarks on [Dan
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007). The thought is: We are still
sorely suffering for our sins, by being yet under the yoke of foreign
sovereigns.

[Ezr 9:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008)

"And now for a little moment there has been mercy from the Lord our God,
to leave us a rescued remnant, and to give us a nail in His holy place,
that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our
bondage." He calls the short interval between their release from
captivity by Cyrus, and the time when he is speaking, רגע כּמעט, a
little moment (comp. [Isa 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020)), in
comparison with the long period of suffering from the times of the
Assyrians (comp. [Neh 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032)) till the
reign of Cyrus. פּליטה, a rescued remnant, is the new community
delivered from Babylon, and returned to the land of their fathers. In
proportion to the numerous population of former days, it was but a
remnant that escaped destruction; but a remnant which, according to the
predictions of the prophets, was again to grow into a large nation. A
foundation for this hope was given by the fact that God had given them
"a nail in the place of His sanctuary." The expression is figurative.
יתד is a nail or peg struck into the wall, to hang any kind of domestic
utensils upon; comp. [Isa 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#023), etc.
Such a nail was the place of God's sanctuary, the temple, to the rescued
community. This was to them a firm nail, by which they were borne and
upheld; and this nail God had given them as a support to which they
might cling, and gain new life and vigour. The infinitive clauses
following, להאיר and לתתּנוּ, are dependent upon the preceding
infinitives להשׁאיר and ולתת, and state the purpose for which God has
given a nail in His house to this remnant. That our God may enlighten
our eyes, i.e., may bestow upon us new vitality; comp. [Psa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004). Suffering and misfortune make
the eyes dim, and their light is quenched in death: the enlightened or
beaming eye is an image of vital power; comp. [Sa1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027), [Sa1
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#029). מחיה לתתּנוּ is not to be
translated, ut daret nobis vivificationem, the suffix to לתתּנוּ being
not dative, but accusative. The literal rendering is: that He may make
us a slight reviving. מחיה, the means of supporting life, restoration to
life; see on [Ch2 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#013). Ezra adds
מעט; for the life to which the community had attained was but feeble, in
comparison with a vigorous social life. Their deliverance from Babylon
and return to the land of their fathers was, so to speak, a revival from
death; compare the embodiment of this figure in Ezekiel's vision, [Eze
37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001) : they were, however, still in
a state of vassalage, and had not yet regained their independence. This
thought is further carried out in [Ezr
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#009) : "For we are bondmen, yet our God
hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy to us
before the kings of Persia; so that they have given us a reviving to
build up the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and have given
us a wall about us in Judah and Jerusalem." They who have returned to
Jerusalem and Judah are still bondmen, for they are yet under the
Persian yoke; but God has disposed the kings of Persia so to favour them
as to give them a reviving, to enable them to rebuild the house of God.
Cyrus and Darius had not merely permitted and commanded the building of
the temple, but had also furnished them with considerable assistance
towards the carrying out of this work; comp. [Ezr
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003), etc. [Ezr
6:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#007). The suffix in חרבתיו alludes to
אלהים בּית. The words of the last sentence are figurative. גּדר means
the wall of a vineyard, the wall or fence built for its protection ([Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002), [Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005)). Hence the wall, or enclosure, is
an image of protection from the incursions and attacks of enemies. Such
a wall has been given them in Judah and Jerusalem by the kings of
Persia. "The meaning is not that they possess a place defended by walls
(perhaps, therefore, the temple) in Jerusalem and Judah, but that the
Persian kings have given to the new community a safe dwelling-place (or
the means of existence), because the power of the Persian empire secures
to the returned Israelites continued and undisturbed possession of the
city and the land." (Bertheau.)

After this statement concerning the divine favour, Ezra next sets
himself to describe the conduct of his countrymen with respect to the
mercy extended to them.

[Ezr 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#010)

"And now, O our God, what can we say after this? That we have forsaken
Thy commandments," זאת, i.e., such proofs of the divine compassion as
have just been mentioned. The answer which follows commences with כּי,
before which נאמר is mentally repeated: "we can only say that we have
forsaken Thy commandments, requited Thy kindness with sins."

[Ezr 9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#011)

Namely, the commandments "which Thou hast commanded by Thy servants the
prophets, saying, The land unto which ye go to possess it is an unclean
land through the uncleanness of the people of the lands, through their
abominations, wherewith they have filled it from one end to another
through their impurity. And now give not your daughters unto their sons,
neither take their daughters unto your sons (for wives), nor seek their
peace nor their wealth for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good
of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever."
The words of the prophets introduced by לאמר are found in these terms
neither in the prophetical books nor the Pentateuch. They are not,
therefore, to be regarded as a verbal quotation, but only as a
declaration that the prohibition of intermarriage with the heathen had
been inculcated by the prophets. The introduction of this prohibition by
the words: the land unto which ye go to possess it, refers to the Mosaic
age, and in using it Ezra had chiefly in view [Deu
7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001). He interweaves, however, with
this passage other sayings from the Pentateuch, e.g., [Deu
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007), and from the prophetic writings,
without designing to make a verbal quotation. He says quite generally,
by His servants the prophets, as the author of the books of Kings does
in similar cases, e.g., [Kg2 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023);
[Kg2 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#010); [Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002), where the leading idea is, not
to give the saying of some one prophet, but to represent the truth in
question as one frequently reiterated. The sayings of Moses in
Deuteronomy also bear a prophetical character; for in this book he,
after the manner of the prophets, seeks to make the people lay to heart
the duty of obeying the law. It is true that we do not meet in the other
books of Scripture a special prohibition of marriages with Canaanites,
though in the prophetical remarks, [Jdg
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#006), such marriages are reproved as
occasions of seducing the Israelites to idolatry, and in the prophetic
descriptions of the whoredoms of Israel with Baalim, and the general
animadversions upon apostasy from the Lord, the transgression of this
prohibition is implicitly included; thus justifying the general
expression, that God had forbidden the Israelites to contract such
marriages, by His servants the prophets. Besides, we must here take into
consideration the threatening of the prophets, that the Lord would
thrust Israel out of the land for their sins, among which intermarriage
with the Canaanites was by no means the least. Ezra, moreover, makes use
of the general expression, "by the prophets," because he desired to say
that God had not merely forbidden these marriages one or twice in the
law, but had also repeatedly inculcated this prohibition by the
prophets. The law was preached by the prophets when they reiterated what
was the will of God as revealed in the law of Moses. In this respect
Ezra might well designate the prohibition of the law as the saying of
the prophets, and cite it as pronounced according to the circumstances
of the Mosaic period.

(Note: It is hence evident that these words of Ezra afford no evidence
against the single authorship of the Pentateuch. The inference that a
saying of the law, uttered during the wanderings in the wilderness, is
here cited as a saying of the prophets the servants of Jahve, is,
according to the just remark of Bertheau, entirely refuted even by the
fact that the words cited are nowhere found in the Pentateuch in this
exact form, and that hence Ezra did not intend to make a verbal
quotation.)

The words: the land into which ye go, etc., recall the introduction of
the law in [Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001), etc.; but the
description of the land as a land of uncleanness through the uncleanness
of the people, etc., does not read thus either in the Pentateuch or in
the prophets. נדּה, the uncleanness of women, is first applied to moral
impurity by the prophets: comp. [Lam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017); [Eze
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#020); [Eze
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017), comp. [Isa
64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005). The expression מפּה אל־פּה, from
edge to edge, i.e., from one end to the other, like לפה פּה, [Kg2
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#021); [Kg2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016), is taken from vessels filled to
their upper rim. ועתּה introduces the consequence: and now, this being
the case. The prohibition וגו תּתּנוּ אל is worded after [Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003). The addition: nor seek their
peace, etc., is taken almost verbally from [Deu
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007), where this is said in respect of
the Ammonites and Moabites. תּחזקוּ למאן recalls [Deu
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#008), and the promise: that ye may eat
the good of the land for ever, [Isa
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019). לבניכם והורשׁתּם, and leave it
for an inheritance to your children, does not occur in this form in the
Pentateuch, but only the promise: that they and their children should
possess the land for ever. On הורישׁ in this sense comp. [Jdg
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024); [Ch2
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#011).

[Ezr 9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013)

And after all, continues Ezra, taking up again the אחרי־זאת of [Ezr
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#010), - "after all that is come upon
us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass - yea, Thou our God
has spared us more than our iniquity deserved, and hast given us this
escaped remnant - can we again break Thy commandments, and join in
affinity with the people of these abominations? Wilt Thou not be angry
with us even to extirpation, so that no residue and no escaped remnant
should be left?" The premiss in [Ezr
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013) is followed in [Ezr
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#014) by the conclusion in the form of
a question, while the second clause of [Ezr
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013) is an explanatory parenthesis.
Bertheau construes the passage otherwise. He finds the continuation of
the sentence: and after all this ... in the words וגו אתּה כּי, which,
calmly spoken, would read: Thou, O God, hast not wholly destroyed us,
but hast preserved to us an escaped remnant; while instead of such a
continuation we have an exclamation of grateful wonder, emphatically
introduced by כּי in the sense of כּי אמנם. With this construction of
the clauses, however, no advance is made, and Ezra, in this prayer, does
but repeat what he had already said, [Ezr
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008) and [Ezr
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#009); although the introductory אהרי
leads us to expect a new thought to close the confession. Then, too, the
logical connection between the question [Ezr
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#014) and what precedes it would be
wanting, i.e., a foundation of fact for the question [Ezr
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#014). Bertheau remarks on [Ezr
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#014), that the question: should we
return to break (i.e., break again) the commands of God? is an
antithesis to the exclamation. But neither does this question, to judge
by its matter, stand in contrast to the exclamation, nor is any such
contrast indicated by its form. The discourse advances in regular
progression only when [Ezr 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#014) forms
the conclusion arrived at from [Ezr
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013), and the thought in the premiss
(13a) is limited by the thoughts introduced with כּי. What had come upon
Israel for their sins was, according to [Ezr
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007), deliverance into the hand of
heathen kings, to the sword, to captivity, etc. God had not, however,
merely chastened and punished His people for their sins, He had also
extended mercy to them, [Ezr 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008), etc.
This, therefore, is also mentioned by Ezra in [Ezr
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013), to justify, or rather to limit,
the כּל in כּל־הבּא. The כּי is properly confirmatory: for Thou, our
God, hast indeed punished us, but not in such measure as our sins had
deserved; and receives through the tenor of the clause the adversative
meaning of imo, yea (comp. Ewald, 330, b). למטּה מ חשׂכתּ, Thou hast
checked, hast stopped, beneath our iniquities. חשׂך is not used
intransitively, but actively; the missing object must be supplied from
the context: Thou hast withheld that, all of which should have come upon
us, i.e., the punishment we deserved, or, as older expositors completed
the sense, iram tuam. מעוננוּ למטּה, infra delicta nostra, i.e., Thou
hast punished us less than our iniquities deserved. For their iniquities
they had merited extirpation; but God had given them a rescued remnant.
כּזאת, as this, viz., this which exists in the community now returned
from Babylon to Judaea. This is the circumstance which justifies the
question: should we, or can we, again (נשׁוּב is used adverbially) break
Thy commandments, and become related by marriage? (חתחתּן like [Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003).) התּעבות עמּי, people who live in
abominations. The answer to this question is found in the subsequent
question: will He not - if, after the sparing mercy we have experienced,
we again transgress the commands of God - by angry with us till He have
consumed us? כּלּה עד (comp. [Kg2
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#017), [Kg2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#019)) is strengthened by the
addition: so that there will be no remnant and no escaping. The question
introduced by הלוא is an expression of certain assurance: He will most
certainly consume us.

[Ezr 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#015)

"Jahve, God of Israel, Thou art righteous; for we remain an escaped
remnant, as (it is) this day. Behold, we are before Thee in our
trespass; for no one can stand before Thy face, because of this." Ezra
appeals to the righteousness of God, not to supplicate pardon, as [Neh
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#033), for the righteousness of God
would impel Him to extirpate the sinful nation, but to rouse the
conscience of the community, to point out to them what, after this
relapse into their old abominations, they had to expect from the justice
of God. נשׁארנוּ כּי is confirmatory. God has shown Himself to be just
by so sorely punishing this once numerous nation, that only a small
remnant which has escaped destruction now exists. And this remnant has
again most grievously offended: we lie before Thee in our trespass; what
can we expect from Thy justice? Nothing but destruction; for there is no
standing before Thee, i.e., no one can stand before Thee, על־זאת,
because of this (comp. [Ezr 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#023); [Ezr
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#002)), i.e., because of the fresh
guilt which we have incurred.
