Israel's Bulwark against Temptation to Apostasy

The favourite word Israel furnished the outward occasion for annexing
this Psalm to the preceding. The situation is like that in [Psa
123:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md) and [Psa
124:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md). The people are under foreign
dominion. In this lies the seductive inducement to apostasy. The pious
and the apostate ones are already separated. Those who have remained
faithful shall not, however, always remain enslaved. Round about
Jerusalem are mountains, but more important still: Jahve, of rocks the
firmest, Jahve encompasses His people.

That this Psalm is one of the latest, appears from the circumstantial
expression "the upright in their hearts," instead of the old one, "the
upright of heart," from פעלי האון instead of the former פעלי און, and
also from למען לא (beside this passage occurring only in [Psa
119:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011.md), [Psa
119:80](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#080.md); [Eze
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#009.md); [Eze
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020.md); [Zac
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#007).md) instead of למען אשׁר לא or פּן.

[Psalms 125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 125:1</span></span>

The stedfastness which those who trust in Jahve prove in the midst of
every kind of temptation and assault is likened to Mount Zion, because
the God to whom they believingly cling is He who sits enthroned on Zion.
The future ישׁב signifies: He sits and will sit, that is to say, He
continues to sit, cf. [Psa 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008.md); [Psa
122:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#005.md). Older expositors are of opinion
that the heavenly Zion must be understood on account of the Chaldaean
and the Roman catastrophes; but these, in fact, only came upon the
buildings on the mountain, not upon the mountain itself, which in itself
and according to its appointed destiny (vid., [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012.md); [Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001).md) remained unshaken. in [Psa
125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002.md) also it is none other than the
earthly Jerusalem that is meant. The holy city has a natural
circumvallation of mountains, and the holy nation that dwells and
worships therein has a still infinitely higher defence in Jahve, who
encompasses it round (vid., on [Psa
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008).md), as perhaps a wall of fire ([Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005).md), or an impassably broad and
mighty river ([Isa 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021).md); a statement
which is also now confirmed, for, etc. Instead of inferring from the
clause [Psa 125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002.md) that which is to be
expected with לכן, the poet confirms it with כי by that which is surely
to be expected.

[Psalms 125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 125:3</span></span>

The pressure of the worldly power, which now lies heavily upon the holy
land, will not last for ever; the duration of the calamity is exactly
proportioned to the power of resistance of the righteous, whom God
proves and purifies by calamity, but not without at the same time
graciously preserving them. "The rod of wickedness" is the heathen
sceptre, and "the righteous" are the Israelites who hold fast to the
religion of their fathers. The holy land, whose sole entitled inheritors
are these righteous, is called their "lot" (גורל, κλῆρος = κληρονομία).
נוּח signifies to alight or settle down anywhere, and having alighted,
to lean upon or rest (cf. [Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md)
with [Joh 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032), ἔμεινεν.md). The lxx
renders οὐκ ἀφφήσει, i.e., לא ינּיח (cf. on the other hand יניח, He
shall let down, cause to come down, in [Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032).md). Not for a continuance shall
the sceptre of heathen tyranny rest upon the holy land, God will not
suffer that: in order that the righteous may not at length, by virtue of
the power which pressure and use exercises over men, also participate in
the prevailing ungodly doings. שׁלח with Beth: to seize upon anything
wrongfully, or even only (as in [Job
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#009).md) to lay one's hand upon anything
(frequently with על). As here in the case of עולתה, in [Psa
80:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#003.md) too the form that is the same as
the locative is combined with a preposition.

[Psalms 125:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 125:4</span></span>

On the ground of the strong faith in [Psa
125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md). and of the confident hope in
[Psa 125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003.md), the petition now arises
that Jahve would speedily bestow the earnestly desired blessing of
freedom upon the faithful ones, and on the other hand remove the
cowardly lit. those afraid to confess God and those who have fellowship
with apostasy, together with the declared wicked ones, out of the way.
For such is the meaning of [Psa 125:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#004.md).
טובים (in Proverbs alternating with the "righteous," [Pro
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#020.md), the opposite being the "wicked,"
רשׁעים, [Pro 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#019).md) are here those who
truly believe and rightly act in accordance with the good will of God,

(Note: The Midrash here calls to mind a Talmudic riddle: There came a
good one (Moses, [Exo 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#002).md) and
received a good thing (the Tra, [Pro
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#002).md) from the good One (God, [Psa
145:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#009).md) for the good ones (Israel, [Psa
125:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#004))..md)

or, as the parallel member of the verse explains (where לישׁרים did not
require the article on account of the addition), those who in the bottom
of their heart are uprightly disposed, as God desires to have it. The
poet supplicates good for them, viz., preservation against denying God
and deliverance out of slavery; for those, on the contrary, who bend
(הטּה) their crooked paths, i.e., turn aside their paths in a crooked
direction from the right way (עקלקלּותם, cf. [Jdg
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006.md), no less than in [Amo
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007.md); [Pro
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023.md), an accusative of the object,
which is more natural than that it is the accusative of the direction,
after [Num 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#023.md) extrem., cf. [Job
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011.md); [Isa
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#011).md) - for these he wishes that
Jahve would clear them away (הוליך like Arab. ahlk, perire facere =
perdere) together with the workers of evil, i.e., the open, manifest
sinners, to whom these lukewarm and sly, false and equivocal ones are in
no way inferior as a source of danger to the church. lxx correctly: τοὺς
δὲ ἐκκλίνοντας εἰς τάς στραγγαλιὰς (Aquila διαπλοκάς, Symmachus
σκολιότητας, Theodotion διεστραμμένα) ἀπάξει κύριος μετὰ κ. τ. λ..
Finally, the poet, stretching out his hand over Israel as if pronouncing
the benediction of the priest, gathers up all his hopes, prayers, and
wishes into the one prayer: "Peace be upon Israel." He means "the Israel
of God," [Gal 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md). Upon this Israel
he calls down peace from above. Peace is the end of tyranny, hostility,
dismemberment, unrest, and terror; peace is freedom and harmony and
unity and security and blessedness.
