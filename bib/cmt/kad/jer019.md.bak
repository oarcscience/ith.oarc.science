### [Jeremiah Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 19:1</span></span>

The Broken Pitcher. - [Jer 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md). "Thus
said Jahveh: Go and buy a potter's vessel, and take of the elders of the
people and of the elders of the priests, [Jer
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#002.md). And go forth into the valley of
Benhinnom, which is before the gate Harsuth, and proclaim there the
words which I shall speak unto thee, [Jer
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003.md). And say: Hear the word of
Jahveh, ye kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus hath said
Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I bring evil upon this
place, the which whosoever heareth his ears shall tingle. [Jer
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004.md). Because they have forsaken me,
and disowned this place, and burnt incense in it to other gods whom they
knew not, they, and their fathers, and the kings of Judah, and have
filled this place with the blood of innocents, [Jer
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005.md). And have built high places for
Baal, to burn their sons in the fire as burnt-offerings to Baal, which I
have neither commanded nor spoken, nor came it into my heart. [Jer
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006.md). Therefore, behold, days come,
saith Jahve, that this place shall no longer be called Tophet and Valley
of Benhinnom, but Valley of Slaughter. [Jer
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#007.md). And I make void the counsel of
Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and cause them to fall by the sword
before their enemies and by the hand of them that seek their lives, and
give their carcases to be food for the fowls of the heaven and the beast
of the earth. [Jer 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md). And make this
city a dismay and a scoffing; every one that passeth thereby shall be
dismayed and hiss because of all her strokes; [Jer
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009.md). And make them eat the flesh of
their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and each shall eat his
neighbour's flesh in the siege and straitness wherewith their enemies
and they that seek after their lives shall straiten them. - [Jer
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#010.md). And break the pitcher before
the eyes of the men that go with thee, [Jer
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011.md). And say to them: Thus hath
Jahve of hosts said: Even so will I break this people and this city as
one breaketh this potter's vessel, that it cannot be made whole again;
and in Tophet shall they bury them, because there is no room to bury.
[Jer 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#012.md). Thus will I do unto this
place, saith Jahveh, and its inhabitants, to make this city as Tophet.
[Jer 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md). And the houses of
Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall become, as the
place Tophet, unclean, all the houses upon whose roofs they have burnt
incense to the whole host of heaven and poured out drink-offerings to
other gods."

The purpose for which Jeremiah was to buy the earthen jar is told in
[Jer 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#010.md), and the meaning of
breaking it in the valley of Benhinnom is shown in [Jer
19:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011.md). בּקבּק, from בּקק, to pour
out, is a jar with a narrow neck, so called from the sound heard when
liquid is poured out of it, although the vessel was used for storing
honey, [Kg1 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#003.md). The appellation
יוצר, former of earthen vessels, i.e., potter, is given to denote the
jar as one which, on being broken, would shiver into many fragments.
Before "of the elders of the people" a verb seems to be awanting, for
which cause many supply ולקחתּ (according to [Jer
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#012.md); [Jer
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010), etc..md), rightly so far as sense
is concerned; but we are hardly entitled to assume a lacuna in the text.
That assumption is opposed by the ו before מזּקני; for we cannot
straightway presume that this ו was put in after the verb had dropped
out of the text. In that case the whole word would have been restored.
We have here rather, as Schnur. saw, a bold constructio praegnans, the
verb "buy" being also joined in zeugma with "of the elders:" buy a jar
and (take) certain of the elders; cf. similar, only less bold, zeugmatic
constr. in [Job 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#010.md); [Job
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#012.md); [Isa
58:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#005.md). "Elders of the priests," as in
[Kg2 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#002.md), probably identical with the
"princes (שׂרי) of the priests," [Ch2
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#014.md), are doubtless virtually the
same as the "heads (ראשׁי) of the priests," [Neh
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#007.md), the priests highest in esteem,
not merely for their age, but also in virtue of their rank; just as the
"elders of the people" were a permanent representation of the people,
consisting of the heads of tribes, houses or septs, and families; cf.
[Kg1 8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001.md), and my Bibl. Archol. ii.
S. 218. Jeremiah was to take elders of the people and of the priesthood,
because it was most readily to be expected of them that the word of God
to be proclaimed would find a hearing amongst them. As to the valley of
Benhinnom, see on [Jer 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md). שׁער
החרסוּת, not Sun-gate (after חרס, [Job
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#007.md); [Jdg
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#013).md), but Pottery or Sherd-gate, from
חרס = חרשׂ, in rabbin. חרסית, potter's clay. The Chet. חרסוּת is the
ancient form, not the modern (Hitz.), for the Keri is adapted to the
rabbinical form. The clause, "which is before the Harsuth-gate," is not
meant to describe more particularly the locality, sufficiently well
known in Jerusalem, but has reference to the act to be performed there.
The name, gate of חרסוּת, which nowhere else occurs, points no doubt to
the breaking to shivers of the jar. Hence we are rather to translate
Sherd-gate than Pottery-gate, the name having probably arisen amongst
the people from the broken fragments which lay about this gate. Comm.
are not at one as to which of the known city gates is meant. Hitz. and
Kimchi are wrong in thinking of a gate of the court of the temple - the
southern one. The context demands one of the city gates, two of which
led into the Benhinnom valley: the Spring-or Fountain-gate at the
south-east corner, and the Dung-gate on the south-west side of Zion; see
on [Neh 3:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#013.md). One of these two must
be meant, but which of them it cannot be decided. there Jeremiah is to
cry aloud the words which follow, [Jer
19:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003.md), and which bear on the kings of
Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. "Kings" in the plural, as in
[Jer 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#013.md), because the matter
concerned not the reigning king only, but his successors too, who had
been guilty of the sins to be punished.

[Jer 19:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003.md)

In [Jer 19:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003.md) the threatening is
summarily set forth. Horrible evil will the Lord bring on this place,
i.e., Jerusalem. The ears of every one that hears it will tingle, so
utterly stunning will the news of it turn out to be; cf. [Kg2
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#012.md) and [Sa1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011.md), where we find תּצלּינה; cf. Ew.
197, a. This they have brought on themselves by their dreadful sins.
They have forsaken Jahveh, disowned this place; נכּר , prop. find
strange, [Deu 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027.md), then treat as
strange, deny, [Job 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#029.md). In
substance: they have not treated Jerusalem as the city of the sanctuary
of their God, but, as it mentioned after, they have burnt incense in it
to other (strange) gods. The words: they and their fathers, and the
kings of Judah, are not the subject to "knew not," as is "they and
their," etc., in [Jer 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015.md); [Jer
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013.md), but to the preceding verb of
the principal clause. "And have filled the city with the blood of
innocents." This Grot. and others understand by the blood of the
children slain for Moloch; and for this, appeal is made to [Psa
106:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037.md)., where the pouring out of
innocent blood is explained to be that of sons and daughters offered to
idols. But this passage cannot be the standard for the present one,
neither can the statement that here we have to deal with idolatry alone.
This latter is petitio principii. If shedding the blood of innocents had
been said of offerings to Moloch, then [Jer
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005.md) must be taken as epexegesis. But
in opposition to this we have not only the parallelism of the clauses,
but also and especially the circumstance, that not till [Jer
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005.md) is mention made of altars on
which to offer children of Moloch. We therefore understand the filling
of Jerusalem with the blood of innocents, according to [Jer
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#006.md), cf. [Jer
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#034.md) and [Jer
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003.md), [Jer
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#017.md), of judicial murder or of bloody
persecution of the godly; and on two grounds: 1. because alongside of
idolatry we always find mentioned as the chief sin the perversion of
justice to the shedding of innocent blood (cf. the passages cited), so
that this sin would not likely be omitted here, as one cause of the
dreadful judgment about to pass on Jerusalem; 2. because our passage
recalls the very wording of [Kg2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md), where, after mentioning his
idolatry, it is said of Manasseh: Also innocent blood hath he shed,
until he made Jerusalem full (מלּא) to the brink.

The climax in the enumeration of sins in these verses is accordingly
this: 1. The disowning of the holiness of Jerusalem as the abode of the
Lord by the public practice of idolatry; 2. the shedding of innocent
blood as extremity of injustice and godless judicial practices; 3. as
worst of all abominations, the building of altars for burning their own
children to Moloch. That the Moloch-sacrifices are mentioned last, as
being worst of all, is shown by the three relative clauses: which I have
not commanded, etc., which by an impassioned gradation of phrases mark
God's abomination of these horrors. On this subject cf. [Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md) and [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035.md).

[Jer 19:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006.md)

In [Jer 19:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006.md) the threatened
punishment is given again at large, and that in two strophes or series
of ideas, which explain the emblematical act with the pitcher. The first
series, [Jer 19:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006.md), is introduced by
בּקּותי, which intimates the meaning of the pitcher; and the other, [Jer
19:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#010.md), is bound up with the
breaking of the pitcher. But both series are, [Jer
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006.md), opened by the mention of the
locality of the act. As [Jer 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005.md) was
but an expansion of [Jer 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md), so [Jer
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006.md) is a literal repetition of [Jer
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#032.md). The valley of Benhinnom, with
its places for abominable sacrifices (תּפת, see on [Jer
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#032).md), shall in the future be called
Valley of Slaughter; i.e., at the judgment on Jerusalem it will be the
place where the inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah will be slain by the
enemy. There God will make void (בּקּותי, playing on בּקבּק), i.e.,
bring to nothing; for what is poured out comes to nothing; cf. [Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003.md). There they shall fall by the
sword in such numbers that their corpses shall be food for the beasts of
prey (cf. [Jer 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033).md), and the city of
Jerusalem shall be frightfully ravaged ([Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md), cf. [Jer
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md); [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009), etc..md). מכּתה (plural form of
suffix without Jod; cf. Ew. 258, a), the wounds she has received. - In
[Jer 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009.md) is added yet another item to
complete the awful picture, the terrible famine during the siege, partly
taken from the words of [Deu 28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053.md).
and [Lev 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029.md). That this appalling
misery did actually come about during the last siege by the Chaldeans,
we learn from [Lam 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010.md). - The second
series, [Jer 19:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#010.md), is introduced
by the act of breaking the pitcher. This happens before the eyes of the
elders who have accompanied Jeremiah thither: to them the explanatory
word of the Lord is addressed. As the earthen pitcher, so shall
Jerusalem - people and city - be broken to pieces; and that
irremediably. This is implied in: as one breaks a potter's vessel, etc.
(הרפה for הרפא). The next clause: and in Tophet they shall bury, etc.,
is omitted by the lxx as a repetition from [Jer
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#032.md), and is object to by Ew., Hitz.,
and Graf, as not being in keeping with its context. Ew. proposes to
insert it before "as one breaketh;" but this transposition only obscures
the meaning of the clause. It connects very suitably with the idea of
the incurable breaking in sunder. Because the breaking up of Jerusalem
and its inhabitants shall be incurable, shall be like the breaking of a
pitcher dashed into countless fragments, therefore there will be lack of
room in Jerusalem to bury the dead, and the unclean places of Tophet
will need to be used for that purpose. With this the further thought of
[Jer 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#012.md) and [Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md) connects simply and suitably.
Thus (as had been said at [Jer 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011).md)
will I do unto this place and its inhabitants, ולתת, and that to make
the city as Tophet, i.e., not "a mass of sherds and rubbish, as Tophet
now is" (Graf); for neither was Tophet then a rubbish-heap, nor did it
so become by the breaking of the pitcher. But Josiah had turned all the
place of Tophet in the valley of Benhinnom into an unclean region ([Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010).md). All Jerusalem shall become an
unclean place like Tophet. This is put in so many words in [Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md) : The houses of Jerusalem shall
become unclean like the place Tophet, namely, all houses on whose roofs
idolatry has been practised. The construction of הטּמאים causes some
difficulty. The position of the word at the end disfavours our
connecting it with the subject בּתּי, and so does the article, which
does not countenance its being taken as predicate. To get rid of the
article, J. D. Mich. and Ew. sought to change the reading into תּפתּה
טמאים, after [Isa 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md). But תּפתּה
means a Tophet-like place, not Tophet itself, and so gives no meaning to
the purpose. No other course is open than to join the word with "the
place Tophet:" like the place Tophet, which is unclean. The plural would
then be explained less from the collective force of מקום than from
regard to the plural subject. "All the houses" opens a supplementary
definition of the subject: as concerning all houses; cf. Ew. 310, a. On
the worship of the stars by sacrifice on the housetops, transplanted by
Manasseh to Jerusalem, see the expos. of [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md) and [Kg2
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md). 'והסּך, coinciding literally
with [Jer 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018.md); the inf. absol. being
attached to the verb. finit. of the former clause (Ew. 351, c.). - Thus
far the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, which he was to proclaim in the
valley of Benhinnom. - The execution of the divine commission is, as
being a matter of course, not expressly recounted, but is implied in
[Jer 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#014.md) as having taken place.

[Jeremiah 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 19:14</span></span>

The Prophet Jeremiah and the Temple-Warden Pashur. - [Jer
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#014.md). When Jeremiah, having performed
the divine command, returned from Tophet to the city, he went into the
court of the house of God and spoke to the people assembled there, v.
15: "Thus hath said Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I bring
upon this city, and all its cities, all the evil that I have pronounced
against it, because they stiffened their necks not to hear my words."
"All the people" is the people present in the court of the temple as
distinguished from the men who had accompanied Jeremiah into the valley
of Benhinnom ([Jer 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#010).md). מבי, the א
having dropped off, as in [Jer 39:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#016.md);
[Kg1 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021.md), [Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md); [Sa2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002.md), and often. "All its cities" are
the towns that belonged to Jerusalem, were subject to it ([Jer
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001).md); in other words, the cities of
Judah, [Jer 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015.md); [Jer
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010.md), etc. All the evil that I have
pronounced against it, not merely in the valley of Benhinnom ([Jer
19:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003).md), but generally up till this
time, by the mouth of Jeremiah. If we limit the reference of this view
to the prophecy in Tophet, we must assume, with Ng., that Jeremiah
repeated the substance of it here; and besides, that prophecy is not in
keeping with "all its cities," inasmuch as it ([Jer
19:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003).md) deals with Jerusalem alone.
Apparently Jeremiah must have said more than is written in the verse,
and described the evil somewhat more closely; so that the new matter
spoken by him here consists in the "Behold I bring," etc., i.e., in his
forewarning them of the speedy fulfilment of the threatenings against
Jerusalem and Judah, as was the case with the prophecy in the valley of
Benhinnom, which also, [Jer 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003.md),
begins with הנני מביא. On "they stiffened their necks," etc., cf. [Jer
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#023.md); [Jer
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#026.md).
