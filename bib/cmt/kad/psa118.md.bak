Festival Psalm at the Dedication of the New Temple

What the close of [Psa 117:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001.md) says of
God's truth, viz., that it endureth for ever, the beginning of Ps 118
says of its sister, His mercy or loving-kindness. It is the closing
Psalm of the Hallel, which begins with [Psa
113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md), and the third Hodu (vid., on
Ps 105). It was Luther's favourite Psalm: his beauteous Confitemini,
which "had helped him out of troubles out of which neither emperor nor
king, nor any other man on earth, could have helped him." With the
exposition of this his noblest jewel, his defence and his treasure, he
occupied himself in the solitude of his Patmos.

It is without any doubt a post-exilic song. Here too Hupfeld sweeps away
everything into vague generality; but the history of the period after
the Exile, without any necessity for our coming down to the Maccabean
period, as do De Wette and Hitzig, presents three occasions which might
have given birth to it; viz., (1) The first celebration of the Feast of
Tabernacles in the seventh month of the first year of the Return, when
there was only a plain altar as yet erected on the holy place, [Ezr
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md) (to be distinguished from a
later celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles on a large scale and in
exact accordance with the directions of the Law, Neh. 8). So Ewald. (2)
The laying of the foundation-stone of the Temple in the second month of
the second year, [Ezr 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md). So
Hengstenberg. (3) The dedication of the completed temple in the twelfth
month of the sixth year of Darius, [Ezr
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#015.md). So Stier. These references to
contemporary history have all three more or less in their favour. The
first if favoured more especially by the fact, that at the time of the
second Temple [Psa 118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md) was the
festal cry amidst which the altar of burnt-offering was solemnly
compassed on the first six days of the Feast of Tabernacles once, and on
the seventh day seven times. This seventh day was called the great
Hosanna (Hosanna rabba), and not only the prayers for the Feast of
Tabernacles, but even the branches of willow trees (including the
myrtles) which are bound to the palm-branch (lulab), were called
Hosannas (הושׁענות, Aramaic הושׁעני).

(Note: Vid., my Talmudic Studies, vi. (Der Hosianna-Ruf), in the
Lutherische Zeischrift, 1855, S. 653-656.)

The second historical reference is favoured by the fact, that the
narrative appears to point directly to our Psalm when it says: And the
builders laid the foundation of the Temple of Jahve, and the priests
were drawn up there in official robes with trumpets, and the Levites the
descendants of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Jahve after the direction
of David king of Israel, and they sang על־ישׂראל בּהלּל וּבהודת ליהוה
כּי טוב כּי־לעולם חסדּו; and all the people raised a great shout בּהלּל
ליהוה, because the house of Jahve was founded. But both of these
derivations of the Psalm are opposed by the fact that [Psa
116:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#019.md) and [Psa
118:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#020.md) assume that the Temple-building
is already finished; whereas the unmistakeable allusions to the events
that transpired during the building of the Temple, viz., the intrigues
of the Samaritans, the hostility of the neighbouring peoples, and the
capriciousness of the Persian kings, favour the third. In connection
with this reference of the Psalm to the post-exilic dedication of the
Temple, [Psa 118:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md), too, now
present no difficulty. [Psa 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md) is
better understood as spoken in the presence of the now upreared
Temple-building, than as spoken in the presence of the foundation-stone;
and the words "unto the horns of the altar" in [Psa
118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027.md), interpreted in many different
ways, come into the light of [Ezr
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#017.md).

The Psalm falls into two divisions. The first division (vv. 1-19) is
sung by the festive procession brought up by the priests and Levites,
which is ascending to the Temple with the animals for sacrifice. With
[Psa 118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md) the procession stands at
the entrance. The second part ([Psa
118:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#020).md) is sung by the body of
Levites who receive the festive procession. Then [Psa
118:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#028.md) is the answer of those who have
arrived, and [Psa 118:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#029.md) the
concluding song of all of them. This antiphonal arrangement is
recognised even by the Talmud (B. Pesachim 119a) and Midrash. The whole
Psalm, too, has moreover a peculiar formation. It resembles the Mashal
Psalms, for each verse has of itself its completed sense, its own scent
and hue; one thought is joined to another as branch to branch and flower
to flower.

[Psalms 118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 118:1</span></span>

The Hodu-cry is addressed first of all and every one; then the whole
body of the laity of Israel and the priests, and at last (as it appears)
the proselytes (vid., on [Psa
115:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009).md) who fear the God of
revelation, are urgently admonished to echo it back; for "yea, His mercy
endureth for ever," is the required hypophon. In [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md), Israel too then begins as one
man to praise the ever-gracious goodness of God. יהּ, the Jod of which
might easily become inaudible after קראתי, has an emphatic Dagesh as in
[Psa 118:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#018.md), and המּצר has the
orthophonic stroke beside צר (the so-called מקּל), which points to the
correct tone-syllable of the word that has Dechמ.

(Note: Vid., Baer's Thorath Emeth, p. 7 note, and p. 21, end of note 1.)

Instead of ענני it is here pointed ענני, which also occurs in other
instances not only with distinctive, but also (though not uniformly)
with conjunctive accents.

(Note: Hitzig on [Pro 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md) considers
the pointing קנני to be occasioned by Dech, and in fact ענני in the
passage before us has Tarcha, and in [Sa1
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015.md) Munach; but in the passage
before us, if we read במרחביה as one word according to the Masora, ענני
is rather to be accented with Mugrash; and in [Sa1
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015.md) the reading ענני is found side
by side with ענני (e.g., in Bibl. Bomberg. 1521). Nevertheless צרפתני
[Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md), and הרני [Job
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#019.md) (according to Kimchi's Michlol,
30a), beside Mercha, show that the pointing beside conjunctive as beside
disjunctive accents wavers between a& and a4, although a4 is properly
only justified beside disjunctive accents, and צוּני also really only
occurs in pause.)

The constructions is a pregnant one (as in [Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md); [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md); [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md); [Sa2
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#019.md); [Ezr
2:62](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#062.md); [Ch2
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001).md): He answered me by removing me
to a free space ([Psa 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020).md). Both
lines end with יהּ; nevertheless the reading במּרחביה is attested by the
Masora (vid., Baer's Psalterium, pp. 132f.), instead of בּמּרחב יהּ. It
has its advocates even in the Talmud (B. Pesachim 117a), and signifies a
boundless extent, יה expressing the highest degree of comparison, like
מאפּליה in [Jer 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031.md), the deepest
darkness. Even the lxx appears to have read מרחביה thus as one word (εἰς
πλατυσμόν, Symmachus εἰς εὐρυχωρίαν). The Targum and Jerome, however,
render it as we do; it is highly improbable that in one and the same
verse the divine name should not be intended to be used in the same
force of meaning. [Psa 56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md) ([Psa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#010.md); [Psa
56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005.md), [Psa
56:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#012).md) echoes in [Psa
118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006.md); and in [Psa
118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007.md) [Psa
54:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001.md) ([Psa
54:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#006).md) is in the mind of the later
poet. In that passage it is still more clear than in the passage before
us that by the Beth of בּעזרי Jahve is not meant to be designated as
unus e multis, but as a helper who outweighs the greatest multitude of
helpers. The Jewish people had experienced this helpful succour of Jahve
in opposition to the persecutions of the Samaritans and the satraps
during the building of the Temple; and had at the same time learned what
is expressed in [Psa 118:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007.md) (cf. [Psa
146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003).md), that trust in Jahve (for which
חסה ב is the proper word) proves true, and trust in men, on the
contrary, and especially in princes, is deceptive; for under
Pseudo-Smerdis the work, begun under Cyrus, and represented as open to
suspicion even in the reign of Cambyses, was interdicted. But in the
reign of Darius it again became free: Jahve showed that He disposes
events and the hearts of men in favour of His people, so that out of
this has grown up in the minds of His people the confident expectation
of a world-subduing supremacy expressed in [Psa
118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md).

The clauses [Psa 118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md), [Psa
118:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#011.md), and [Psa
118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012.md), expressed in the perfect form,
are intended more hypothetically than as describing facts. The perfect
is here set out in relief as a hypothetical tense by the following
future. כּל־גּוים signifies, as in [Psa
117:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001.md), the heathen of every kind.
דּברים (in the Aramaic and Arabic with )ז are both bees and wasps, which
make themselves especially troublesome in harvest time. The suffix of
אמילם (from מוּל = מלל, to hew down, cut in pieces) is the same as in
[Exo 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#030.md); [Exo
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#017.md), and also beside a conjunctive
accent in [Psa 74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008.md). Yet the reading
אמילם, like יחיתן [Hab 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#017.md), is here
the better supported (vid., Gesenius, Lehrgebude, S. 177), and it has
been adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer. The כּי is that which
states the ground or reason, and then becomes directly confirmatory and
assuring ([Psa 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002.md), [Psa
128:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#004).md), which here, after the "in the
name of Jahve" that precedes it, is applied and placed just as in the
oath in [Sa1 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#044.md). And in general, as
Redslob has demonstrated, כּי has not originally a relative, but a
positive (determining) signification, כ being just as much a
demonstrative sound as ד, ז, שׁ, and ת (cf. ἐκεῖ, ἐκεῖνος, κει'νος,
ecce, hic, illic, with the Doric τηνεί, τῆνος). The notion of compassing
round about is heightened in [Psa
118:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#011.md) by the juxtaposition of two
forms of the same verb (Ges. 67, rem. 10), as in [Hos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md); [Hab
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005.md); [Zep
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md), and frequently. The figure of the
bees is taken from [Deu 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md). The
perfect דּעכוּ (cf. [Isa 43:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017).md)
describes their destruction, which takes place instantly and
unexpectedly. The Pual points to the punishing power that comes upon
them: they are extinguished (exstinguuntur) like a fire of thorns, the
crackling flame of which expires as quickly as it has blazed up ([Psa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010).md). In [Psa
118:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#013.md) the language of Israel is
addressed to the hostile worldly power, as the antithesis shows. It
thrust, yea thrust (inf. intens.) Israel, that it might fall (לנפּל;
with reference to the pointing, vid., on [Psa
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015).md); but Jahve's help would not
suffer it to come to that pass. Therefore the song at the Red Sea is
revived in the heart and mouth of Israel. [Psa
118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014.md) (like [Isa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002).md) is taken from [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002). עזּי (in MSS also written עזּי.md)
is a collateral form of עזּי (Ew. 255, a), and here signifies the lofty
self-consciousness which is united with the possession of power: pride
and its expression an exclamation of joy. Concerning זמרת vid., on [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md). As at that time, the cry of
exultation and of salvation (i.e., of deliverance and of victory) is in
the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of Jahve - they sing -
עשׂה חיל ([Num 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018).md), practises
valour, proves itself energetic, gains (maintains) the victory. רוממה is
Milra, and therefore an adjective: victoriosa (Ew. 120 d), from רמם =
רוּם like שׁומם from שׁמם. It is not the part. Pil. (cf. [Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007).md), since the rejection of the
participial Mem occurs in connection with Poal and Pual, but not
elsewhere with Pilel (רומם = מרומם from רוּם). The word yields a simpler
sense, too, as adject. participle Kal; romēmā́h is only the fuller form
for ramā́h, [Exo 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#008.md) (cf. rā́mah, [Isa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011).md). It is not its own strength
that avails for Israel's exultation of victory, but the energy of the
right hand of Jahve. Being come to the brink of the abyss, Israel is
become anew sure of its immortality through Him. God has, it is true,
most severely chastened it (יסּרנּי with the suffix anni as in [Gen
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#006.md), and יהּ with the emphatic
Dagesh, which neither reduplicates nor connects, cf. [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md), [Psa
94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012).md), but still with moderation
([Isa 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#007)..md). He has not suffered
Israel to fall a prey to death, but reserved it for its high vocation,
that it may see the mighty deeds of God and proclaim them to all the
world. Amidst such celebration of Jahve the festive procession of the
dedication of the Temple has arrived at the enclosure wall of the
Temple.

[Psalms 118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 118:19</span></span>

The gates of the Temple are called gates of righteousness because they
are the entrance to the place of the mutual intercourse between God and
His church in accordance with the order of salvation. First the "gates"
are spoken of, and then the one "gate," the principal entrance. Those
entering in must be "righteous ones;" only conformity with a divine
loving will gives the right to enter. With reference to the formation of
the conclusion [Psa 118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md), vid., Ew.
347, b. In the Temple-building Israel has before it a reflection of that
which, being freed from the punishment it had had to endure, it is
become through the mercy of its God. With the exultation of the
multitude over the happy beginning of the rebuilding there was mingled,
at the laying of the foundation-stone, the loud weeping of many of the
grey-headed priests. Levites, and heads of the tribes who had also seen
the first Temple ([Ezr 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012)..md). It was
the troublous character of the present which made them thus sad in
spirit; the consideration of the depressing circumstances of the time,
the incongruity of which weighed so heavily upon their soul in
connection with the remembrance of the former Temple, that memorably
glorious monument of the royal power of David and Solomon.

(Note: Kurtz, in combating our interpretation, reduces the number of the
weeping ones to "some few," but the narrative says the very opposite.)

And even further on there towered aloft before Zerubbabel, the leader of
the building, a great mountain; gigantic difficulties and hindrances
arose between the powerlessness of the present position of Zerubbabel
and the completion of the building of the Temple, which had it is true
been begun, but was impeded. This mountain God has made into a plain,
and qualified Zerubbabel to bring forth the top and key-stone (האבן
הראשׁה) out of its past concealment, and thus to complete the building,
which is now consecrated amidst a loud outburst of incessant shouts of
joy ([Zac 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007).md). [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md) points back to that
disheartened disdain of the small troubles beginning which was at work
among the builders ([Ezr 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010).md) at the
laying of the foundation-stone, and then further at the interruption of
the buidling. That rejected (disdained) corner-stone is nevertheless
become ראשׁ פּנּהּ, i.e., the head-stone of the corner ([Job
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#006).md), which being laid upon the
corner, supports and protects the stately edifice - an emblem of the
power and dignity to which Israel has attained in the midst of the
peoples out of deep humiliation.

In connection with this only indirect reference of the assertion to
Israel we avoid the question - perplexing in connection with the direct
reference to the people despised by the heathen - how can the heathen be
called "the builders?" Kurtz answers: "For the building which the
heathen world considers it to be its life's mission and its mission in
history to rear, viz., the Babel-tower of worldly power and worldly
glory, they have neither been able nor willing to make use of
Israel...." But this conjunction of ideas is devoid of scriptural
support and without historical reality; for the empire of the world has
set just as much value, according to political relations, upon the
incorporation of Israel as upon that of every other people. Further, if
what is meant is Israel's own despising of the small beginning of a new
ear that is dawning, it is then better explained as in connection with
the reference of the declaration to Jesus the Christ in [Mat
21:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md); [Mar
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010.md)., [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011) (ὑφ ̓ ὑμῶν τῶν οἰκοδομούντων.md),
[Pe1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007.md), the builders are the chiefs
and members of Israel itself, and not the heathen. From [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md); [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md), we see how this reference to
Christ is brought about, viz., by means of [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md), where Jahve says: Behold I am
He who hath laid in Zion a stone, a stone of trial, a precious
corner-stone of well-founded founding - whoever believeth shall not
totter. In the light of this Messianic prophecy of Isaiah [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md) of our Psalm also comes to have
a Messianic meaning, which is warranted by the fact, that the history of
Israel is recapitulated and culminates in the history of Christ; or,
according to [Joh 2:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md) (cf. [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012)..md), still more accurately by the
fact, that He who in His state of humiliation is the despised and
rejected One is become in His state of glorification the eternal
glorious Temple in which dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,
and is united with humanity which has been once for all atoned for. In
the joy of the church at the Temple of the body of Christ which arose
after the three days of burial, the joy which is here typically
expressed in the words: "From with Jahve, i.e., by the might which
dwells with Him, is this come to pass, wonderful is it become (has it
been carried out) in our eyes," therefore received its fulfilment. It is
not נפלאת but נפלאת, like הבאת in [Gen
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#011.md), קראת from קרא = קרה in [Deu
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#029.md); [Jer
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#023.md), קראת from קרא, to call, [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md). We can hear [Isa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md) sounding through this passage, as
above in [Psa 118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md)., [Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md). The God of Israel has given this
turn, so full of glory for His people, to the history.

(Note: The verse, "This is the day which the Lord hath made," etc., was,
according to Chrysostom, an ancient hypophon of the church. It has a
glorious history.)

He is able now to plead for more distant salvation and prosperity with
all the more fervent confidence. אנּא (six times אנּה) is, as in every
other instance (vid., on [Psa 116:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#004).md),
Milra. הושׁיעה is accented regularly on the penult., and draws the
following נא towards itself by means of Dag. forte conj.; הצליחה on the
other hand is Milra according to the Masora and other ancient
testimonies, and נא is not dageshed, without Norzi being able to state
any reason for this different accentuation. After this watchword of
prayer of the thanksgiving feast, in [Psa
118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md) those who receive them bless
those who are coming (הבּא with Dech) in the name of Jahve, i.e., bid
them welcome in His name.

The expression "from the house of Jahve," like "from the fountain of
Israel" in [Psa 68:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#027.md), is equivalent
to, ye who belong to His house and to the church congregated around it.
In the mouth of the people welcoming Jesus as the Messiah, Hoosanna' was
a "God save the king" (vid., on Ps 20:10); they scattered palm branches
at the same time, like the lulabs at the joyous cry of the Feast of
Tabernacles, and saluted Him with the cry, "Blessed is He who cometh in
the name of the Lord," as being the longed-for guest of the Feast ([Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009).md). According to the Midrash, in
[Psa 118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md) it is the people of
Jerusalem who thus greet the pilgrims. In the original sense of the
Psalm, however, it is the body of Levites and priests above on the
Temple-hill who thus receive the congregation that has come up. The many
animals for sacrifice which they brought with them are enumerated in
[Ezr 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#017.md). On the ground of the fact
that Jahve has proved Himself to be אל, the absolutely mighty One, by
having granted light to His people, viz., loving-kindness, liberty, and
joy, there then issues forth the ejaculation, "Bind the sacrifice," etc.
The lxx renders συστήσασθε ἑορτὴν ἐν τοῖς πυκάζουσιν, which is
reproduced by the Psalterium Romanum: constituite diem solemnem in
confrequentationibus, as Eusebius, Theodoret, and Chrysostom (although
the last waveringly) also interpret it; on the other hand, it is
rendered by the psalterium Gallicum: in condensis, as Apollinaris and
Jerome (in frondosis) also understand it. But much as Luther's version,
which follows the latter interpretation, "Adorn the feast with green
branches even to the horns of the altar," accords with our German taste,
it is still untenable; for אסר cannot signify to encircle with garlands
and the like, nor would it be altogether suited to חג in this
signification.

(Note: Symmachus has felt this, for instead of συστήσασθε ἑορτὴν ἐν τοῖς
πυκάζουσιν (in condensis) of the lxx, he renders it, transposing the
notions, συνδήσατε ἐν πανηγύρει πυκάσματα. Chrysostom interprets this:
στεφανώματα καὶ κλάδους ἀνάψατε τῷ ναῷ, for Montfaucon, who regards this
as the version of the Sexta, is in error.)

Thus then in this instance A. Lobwasser renders it comparatively more
correctly, although devoid of taste: "The Lord is great and mighty of
strength who lighteneth us all; fasten your bullocks to the horns beside
the altar." To the horns?! So even Hitzig and others render it. But such
a "binding to" is unheard of. And can אסר עד possibly signify to bind on
to anything? And what would be the object of binding them to the horns
of the altar? In order that they might not run away?! Hengstenberg and
von Lengerke at least disconnect the words "unto the horns of the altar"
from any relation to this precautionary measure, by interpreting: until
it (the animal for the festal sacrifice) is raised upon the horns of the
altar and sacrificed. But how much is then imputed to these words! No
indeed, חג denotes the animals for the feast-offering, and there was so
vast a number of these (according to Ezra loc. cit. seven hundred and
twelve) that the whole space of the court of the priests was full of
them, and the binding of them consequently had to go on as far as to the
horns of the altar. Ainsworth (1627) correctly renders: "unto the
hornes, that is, all the Court over, untill you come even to the hornes
of the altar, intending hereby many sacrifices or boughs." The meaning
of the call is therefore: Bring your hecatombs and make them ready for
sacrifice.

(Note: In the language of the Jewish ritual Isru-chag is become the name
of the after-feast day which follows the last day of the feast. Ps 118
is the customary Psalm for the Isru-chag of all מועדים.)

The words "unto (as far as) the horns of the altar" have the principal
accent. In v. 28 (cf. [Exo 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002).md) the
festal procession replies in accordance with the character of the feast,
and then the Psalm closes, in correspondence with its beginning, with a
Hodu in which all voices join.
