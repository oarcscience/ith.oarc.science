<p>Judah's sin is ineffaceably stamped upon the hearts of the people and on their altars. These four verses are closely connected with the preceding, and show why it is necessary that Judah be cast forth amidst the heathen, by reason of its being perfectly stepped in idolatry. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001">Jer 17:1</A>. "The sin of Judah is written with an iron pen, with the point of a diamond graven on the table of their hearts and on the horns of your altars. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002">Jer 17:2</A>. As they remember their children, so do they their altars and their Astartes by the green tree upon the high hills. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003">Jer 17:3</A>. My mountain in the field, thy substance, all thy treasures give I for a prey, thy high places for sin in all thy borders. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004">Jer 17:4</A>. And thou shalt discontinue, and that of thine own self, from thine inheritance that I gave thee, and I cause thee to serve thine enemies in a land which thou knowest not; for a fire have ye kindled in mine anger, for ever it burneth."
<p>The sin of Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001">Jer 17:1</A>) is not their sinfulness, their proneness to sin, but their sinful practices, idolatry. This is written upon the tables of the hearts of them of Judah, i.e., stamped on them (cf. for this figure <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003">Pro 3:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#003">Pro 7:3</A>), and that deep and firmly. This is intimated by the writing with an iron pen and graving with a diamond. &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1503;, from &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;, scratch, used in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#012">Deu 21:12</A> for the nail of the finger, here of the point of the style or graving-iron, the diamond pencil which gravers use for carving in iron, steel, and stone.
<p>(Note: Cf. Plinii hist. n. xxxvii. 15: crustae adamantis expetuntur a sculptoribus ferroque includuntur, nullam non duritiem ex facili excavantes.)
<p>&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;, diamond, not emery as Boch. and Ros. supposed; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009">Eze 3:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012">Zac 7:12</A>. The things last mentioned are so to be distributed that "on the table of their heart" shall belong to "written with a pen of iron," and "on the horns of their altars" to "with the point of a diamond grave." The iron style was used only for writing or carving letters in a hard material, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#024">Job 19:24</A>. If with it one wrote on tables, it was for the purpose of impressing the writing very deeply, so that it could not easily be effaced. The having of sin engraved upon the tables of the heart does not mean that a sense of unatoned sin could not be got rid of (Graf); for with a sense of sin we have here nothing to do, but with the deep and firm root sin has taken in the heart. To the tables of the heart as the inward seat of sin are opposed the horns of their altars (at "altars" the discourse is directly addressed to the Jews). By altars are generally understood idolatrous altars, partly because of the plural, "since the altar of Jahveh was but one," partly because of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002">Jer 17:2</A>, where the altars in question are certainly those of the idols. But the first reason proves nothing, since the temple of the Lord itself contained two altars, on whose horns the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled. The blood of the sin-offering was put not merely on the altar of burnt-offering, but also on the horns of the altar of incense, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007">Lev 4:7-8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#016">Lev 16:16</A>. Nor is the second reason conclusive, since there is no difficulty in taking it to be the altars of Jahveh as defiled by idolatry. This, indeed, we must do, since Josiah had destroyed the altars of the false gods, whereas here the altars are spoken of as existing monuments of idolatry. The question, in how far the sin of Judah is ineffaceably engraven upon the horns of her altars, is variously answered by comm., and the answer depends on the view taken of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002">Jer 17:2</A>, which is itself disputed. It is certainly wrong to join <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002">Jer 17:2</A> as protasis with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003">Jer 17:3</A> as apodosis, for it is incompatible with the beginning of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003">Jer 17:3</A>, &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;. Ew. therefore proposes to attach "my mountain in the field" to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002">Jer 17:2</A>, and to change &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; into &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;: upon the high hills, the mountains in the field - a manifest makeshift. Umbr. translates: As their children remember their altars...so will I my mountain in the field, thy possession...give for a prey; and makes out the sense to be: "in proportion to the strength and ineffaceableness of the impressions, such as are to be found in the children of idolatrous fathers, must be the severity of the consequent punishment from God." But if this were the force, then &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; could not possibly be omitted before the apodosis; apart altogether from the suddenness of such a transition from the sins of the people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001">Jer 17:1</A>) to the sins of the children.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002">Jer 17:2-3</A>
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002">Jer 17:2</A> is plainly meant to be a fuller and clearer disclosure of the sins written on the tables of Judah's heart, finding therein its point of connection with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001">Jer 17:1</A>. The verse has no verbum finit., and besides it is a question whether "their children" is subject or object to "remember." The rule, that in calm discourse the subject follows the verb, does not decide for us; for the object very frequently follows next, and in the case of the infinitive the subject is often not mentioned, but must be supplied from the context. Here we may either translate: as their sons remember (Chald. and Jerome), or: as they remember their sons. As already said, the first translation gives no sense in keeping with the context. Rashi, Kimchi, J. D. Mich., Maur., Hitz. follow the other rendering: as they remember their children, so do they their altars. On this view, the verb. fin. &#1497;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is supplied from the infin. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;, and the two accusatives are placed alongside, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003">Isa 66:3</A> after the participle, without the particle of comparison demanded by the sense, cf. also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008">Psa 92:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#015">Job 27:15</A>. Ng. calls this construction very harsh; but it has analogues in the passages cited, and gives the very suitable sense: Their altars, Astartes, are as dear to them as their children. Hitz. takes the force to be this: "Whenever they think of their children, they remember, and cannot but remember, the altars to whose horns the blood of their sacrificed children adheres. And so in the case of a green tree upon the heights; i.e., when they light upon such an one, they cannot help calling to mind the Asherahs, which were such trees." But this interpretation is clearly wrong; for it takes the second clause &#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1509; as object to &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;, which is grammatically quite indefensible, and which is besides incompatible with the order of the words. Besides, the idea that they remember the altars because the blood of their children stuck to the horns of them, is put into the words; and the putting of it in is made possible only by Hitz.'s arbitrarily separating "their Astartes" from "their altars," and from the specification of place in the next clause: "by the green tree." The words mean: As they remember their children, so do they their altars and Asherahs by every green tree. The co-ordination of Asherahs and altars makes it clear that it is not sacrifices to Moloch that are meant by altars; for the Asherahs have no connection with the worship of Moloch. Ng.'s assertions, that &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is the name for male images of Baal, and that there can be no doubt of their connection with child-slaughtering Moloch-worship, are unfounded and erroneous. The word means images of Asherah; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023">Kg1 14:23</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021">Deu 16:21</A>. Graf says that &#1512;'  &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1509;does not belong to "altars and Asherahs," because in that case it would need to be &#1512;'  &#1506;&#1509;  &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020">Jer 2:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006">Jer 3:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#013">Jer 3:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005">Isa 57:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002">Deu 12:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#004">Kg2 16:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#010">Kg2 17:10</A>, but that it depends on &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;. This remark is not correctly expressed, and Graf himself gives &#1506;&#1500; a local force, thus: by every green tree and on every high hill they think of the altars and Asherahs. This local relation cannot be spoken of as a "dependence" upon the verb; nor does it necessarily exclude the connection with "altars and Asherahs," since we can quite well think of the altars and Asherahs as being by or beside every green tree and on the hills. At the same time, we hold it better to connect the local reference with the verb, because it gives the stronger sense - namely, that the Jews not merely think of the altars and Asherahs which are by every green tree and upon the high hills, but that by every green tree and on the high hills they think of their altars and Asherahs, even when there are no such things to be seen there. Thus we can now answer the question before thrown out, in what respects the sin was ineffaceably engraven on the horns of the altar: It was because the altars and images of the false gods had entwined themselves as closely about their hearts as their children, so that they brought the sin of their idolatry along with their sacrifices to the altars of Jahveh. The offerings which they bring, in this state of mind, to the Lord are defiled by idolatry and carry their sins to the altar, so that, in the blood which is sprinkled on its horns, the sins of the offerers are poured out on the altar. Hence it appears unmistakeably that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001">Jer 17:1</A> does not deal with the consciousness of sin as not yet cancelled or forgiven, but with the sin of idolatry, which, ineradicably implanted in the hearts of the people and indelibly recorded before God on the horns of the altar, calls down God's wrath in punishment as announced in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003">Jer 17:3</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004">Jer 17:4</A>.
<p>"My mountain in the field" is taken by most comm. as a name for Jerusalem or Zion. But it is a question whether the words are vocative, or whether they are accusative; and so with the rest of the objects, "thy substance," etc., dependent on &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;. If we take them to be vocative, so that Jerusalem is addressed, then we must hold "thy substance" and "thy treasures" to be the goods and gear of Jerusalem, while the city will be regarded as representative of the kingdom, or rather of the population of Judah. But the second clause, "thy high places in all thy borders," does not seem to be quite in keeping with this, and still less <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004">Jer 17:4</A> : thou shalt discontinue from thine inheritance, which is clearly spoken of the people of Judah. Furthermore, if Jerusalem were the party addressed, we should expect feminine suffixes, since Jerusalem is everywhere else personified as a woman, as the daughter of Zion. We therefore hold "my mountain" to be accusative, and, under "the mountain of Jahveh in the field," understand, not the city of Jerusalem, but Mount Zion as the site of the temple, the mountain of the house of Jahveh, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003">Isa 2:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#003">Zac 8:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003">Psa 24:3</A>. The addition &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; may not be translated: with the field (Ges., de W., Ng.); for &#1489;&#1468; denotes the means or instrument, or an accessory accompanying the principal thing or action and subservient to it (Ew. 217, f. 3), but not the mere external surroundings or belongings. Ng.'s assertion, that &#1489;&#1468;, amidst = together with, is due to an extreme position in an empirical mode of treating language. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; means "in the field," and "mountain in the field" is like the "rock of the plain," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013">Jer 21:13</A>. But whether it denotes "the clear outstanding loftiness of the mountain, so that for it we might say: My mountain commanding a wide prospect" (Umbr., Graf), is a question. &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, field, denotes not the fruitful fields lying round Mount Zion, but, like "field of the Amalekites," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007">Gen 14:7</A>, "field of Edom" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#004">Gen 32:4</A>), the land or country; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#002">Eze 21:2</A>; and so here: my mountain in the land (of Judah or Israel). The land is spoken of as a field, as a level or plain (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013">Jer 21:13</A>), in reference to the spiritual height of the temple mountain or mountain of God above the whole land; not in reference to the physical pre-eminence of Zion, which cannot be meant, since Zion is considerably exceeded in height of the highlands of Judah. By its choice to be the site of the Lord's throne amid His people, Mount Zion was exalted above the whole land as is a mountain in the field; and it is hereafter to be exalted above all mountains (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002">Isa 2:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001">Mic 4:1</A>), while the whole land is to be lowered to the level of a plain (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010">Zac 14:10</A>). The following objects are ranged alongside as asyndetons: the Mount Zion as His peculiar possession and the substance of the people, all their treasures will the Lord give for a prey to the enemy. "Thy high places" is also introduced, with rhetorical effect, without copula. "Thy high places," i.e., the heights on which Judah had practised idolatry, will He give up, for their sins' sake, throughout the whole land. The whole clause, from "thy high places" to "thy borders," is an apposition to the first half of the verse, setting forth the reason why the whole land, the mountain of the Lord, and all the substance of the people, are to be delivered to the enemy; because, viz., the whole land has been defiled by idolatry. Hitz. wrongly translates &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; for sin, i.e., for a sin-offering.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004">Jer 17:4</A>
<p> And thou shalt discontinue from thine inheritance. There is in &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1496;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; an allusion to the law in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011">Exo 23:11</A>, to let the ground lie untilled in the seventh year, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002">Deu 15:2</A>, to let loans go, not to exact from one's neighbour what has been lent to him. Because Judah has transgressed this law, the Lord will compel the people to let go their hold of their inheritance, i.e., He will cast them out of it. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1498; seems strange, interposed between the verb and the "from thine inheritance" dependent on it. The later Greek translators (for the entire passage <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001">Jer 17:1-4</A> is wanting in the lxx) render it &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, and Jerome sola. Ew. therefore conjectures &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1491;, but without due reason, since the translation is only a free rendering of: and that by thyself. J. D. Mich., Gr., and Ng. propose to read &#1497;&#1491;&#1498;, on the ground of the connection wrongly made between &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1496; and &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, to let go his hand, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002">Deu 15:2</A>, given in Ges. Lex. s.v. For &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; in this case is not object to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1496;, but belongs to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, hand-lending; and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#003">Deu 15:3</A> &#1497;&#1491;&#1498; is subject to &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1496;, the hand shall quit hold. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1498; sig. and that by thee, i.e., by thine own fault; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#016">Eze 22:16</A>. Meaning: by thine own fault thou must needs leave behind thee thine inheritance, thy land, and serve thine enemies in a foreign land. On the last clause, "for a fire," etc., cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014">Jer 15:14</A>, where is also discussed the relation of the present <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003">Jer 17:3</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004">Jer 17:4</A> to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013">Jer 15:13-14</A>. For ever burns the fire, i.e., until the sin is blotted out by the punishment, and for ever inasmuch as the wicked are to be punished for ever.

<p> Further Confirmation of this Announcement in General Reflections concerning the Sources of Ruin and of well-being. - This portion falls into two halves: a. On the sources of ruin and of well-being (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005">Jer 17:5-18</A>); b. On the way to life (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018">Jer 17:18-27</A>). The reflections of the first half show the curse of confidence in man and the blessings of confidence in God the Lord, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005">Jer 17:5-13</A>; to which is joined, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014">Jer 17:14-18</A>, a prayer of the prophet for deliverance from his enemies.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005">Jer 17:5-6</A>
<p>"Thus saith Jahveh: Cursed is the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm, while his heart departeth from Jahveh. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006">Jer 17:6</A>. He shall be as a destitute man in the wilderness, and shall not see that good cometh; he shall inhabit parched places in the desert, a salt land and uninhabited. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007">Jer 17:7</A>. Blessed is the man that trusteth in Jahve, and whose trust Jahveh is. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008">Jer 17:8</A>. He shall be as a tree planted by the water, and shall by the river spread out his roots, and shall not fear when heat cometh; his leaves shall be green, and in the year of drought he shall not have care, neither cease from yielding fruit. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009">Jer 17:9</A>. Deceitful is the heart above all, and corrupt it is, who can know it? <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010">Jer 17:10</A>. I Jahveh search the heart and try the reins, even to give every one according to his way, according to the fruit of his doings. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011">Jer 17:11</A>. The partridge hatCheth the egg which it laid not; there is that getteth riches and not by right. In the midst of his days they forsake him, and at his end he shall be a fool. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012">Jer 17:12</A>. Thou throne of glory, loftiness from the beginning, thou place of our sanctuary. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013">Jer 17:13</A>. Thou hope of Israel, Jahveh, all that forsake Thee come to shame. They that depart from me shall be written in the earth, for they have forsaken the fountain of living water, Jahveh."
<p>Trust in man and departure from God brings only mischief (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005">Jer 17:5</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006">Jer 17:6</A>); trust in the Lord brings blessing only (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007">Jer 17:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008">Jer 17:8</A>). These truths are substantiated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009">Jer 17:9-13</A>, and elucidated by illustrations.
<p>Trust in man is described according to the nature of it in the second clause: he that maketh flesh his arm, i.e., has strength. Flesh, the antithesis to spirit (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003">Isa 31:3</A>), sets forth the vanity and perishableness of man and of all other earthly beings; cf. besides <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003">Isa 31:3</A>, also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#004">Job 10:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005">Psa 56:5</A>. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006">Jer 17:6</A> we are shown the curse of this trusting in man. One who so does is as &#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512; in the steppe. This word, which is found beside only in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018">Psa 102:18</A>, and in the form &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006">Jer 48:6</A>, is rendered by the old translators by means of words which mean desert plants or thorny growths (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;; Jerome, myrice; similarly in Chald. and Syr.); so Ew., arid shrub; Umbr., a bare tree. All these renderings are merely guesses from the context; and the latter, indeed, tells rather against than for a bush or tree, since the following clause, "he shall not see," can be said only of a man. So in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018">Psa 102:18</A>, where we hear of the prayer of the &#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512;. The word is from &#1506;&#1512;&#1512;, to be naked, made bare, and denotes the destitute man, who lacks all the means of subsistence. It is not the homeless or outcast (Graf, Hitz.). He shall not see, i.e., experience that good comes, i.e., he shall have no prosperity, but shall inhabit "burnt places," tracts in the desert parched by the sun's heat. Salt-land, i.e., quite unfruitful land; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022">Deu 29:22</A>. &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; is a relative clause: and which is not inhabited = uninhabitable. Dwelling in parched tracts and salt regions is a figure for the total want of the means of life (equivalent to the German: auf keinen grnen Zweig kommen).
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007">Jer 17:7-8</A>
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007">Jer 17:7</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008">Jer 17:8</A> show the companion picture, the blessings of trusting in the Lord. "That trusteth in Jahveh" is strengthened by the synonymous "whose trust Jahveh is;" cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005">Psa 40:5</A>. The portrayal of the prosperity of him that trusts in the Lord is an extension of the picture in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003">Psa 1:3-4</A>, of the man that hath his delight in the law of the Lord. The form &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; is &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., equivalent to &#1497;&#1489;&#1500;, water-brook, which, moreover, occurs only in the plural (&#1497;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025">Isa 30:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004">Isa 44:4</A>. He spreads forth his roots by the brook, to gain more and more strength for growth. The Chet. &#1497;&#1512;&#1488; is imperf. from &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;, and is to be read &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;. The Keri gives &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; from &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, corresponding to the &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006">Jer 17:6</A>. The Chet. is unqualifiedly right, and &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488; correspond to &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1488;&#1490;. As to &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001">Jer 14:1</A>. He has no fear for the heat in the year of drought, because the brook by which he grows does not dry up.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009">Jer 17:9</A>
<p>To bring this truth home to the people, the prophet in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009">Jer 17:9</A> discloses the nature of the human heart, and then shows in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010">Jer 17:10</A> how God, as the Searcher of hearts, requites man according to his conduct. Trust in man has its seat in the heart, which seeks thereby to secure to itself success and prosperity. But the heart of man is more deceitful, cunning than all else &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, from the denom. &#1506;&#1511;&#1489; .moned , to deal treacherously). &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, lit., dangerously sick, incurable, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018">Jer 15:18</A>; here, sore wounded by sin, corrupt or depraved. Who can know it? i.e., fathom its nature and corruptness. Therefore a man must not trust the suggestions and illusions of his own heart.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010">Jer 17:10-11</A>
<p>Only God searches the heart and tries the reins, the seat of the most hidden emotions and feelings, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020">Jer 11:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#003">Jer 12:3</A>, and deals accordingly, requiting each according to his life and his doings. The &#1493; before &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;, which is wanting in many MSS and is not expressed by the old translators, is not to be objected to. It serves to separate the aim in view from the rest, and to give it the prominence due to an independent thought; cf. Ew. 340, b. As to the truth itself, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019">Jer 32:19</A>. With this is joined the common saying as to the partridge, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011">Jer 17:11</A>. The aim is not to specify greed as another root of the corruption of the heart, or to give another case of false confidence in the earthly (Ng., Graf); but to corroborate by a common saying, whose truth should be obvious to the people, the greater truth, that God, as Searcher of hearts, requites each according to his works. The proverb ran: He that gains riches, and that by wrong, i.e., in an unjust, dishonourable manner, is like a partridge which hatches eggs it has not laid. In the Proverbs we often find comparisons, as here, without the &#1499;&#1468; similit.: a gainer of riches is a partridge (Rephuhn, properly Rphuhn from rpen = rufen, to call or cry); a bird yet found in plenty in the tribe of Judah; cf. Robinson, Palestine. All other interpretations are arbitrary. It is true that natural history has not proved the fact of this peculiarity of the partridge, on which the proverb was founded; testimonies as to this habit of the creature are found only in certain Church fathers, and these were probably deduced from this passage (cf. Winer, bibl. R. W., art. Rebhuhn). But the proverb assumes only the fact that such was the widespread popular belief amongst the Israelites, without saying anything as to the correctness of it. "HatCheth and layeth not" are to be taken relatively. &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;, the Targum word in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#014">Job 39:14</A> for &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501;, fovere, sig. hatch, lit., to hold eggs close together, cover eggs; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015">Isa 34:15</A>. &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, to bring forth, here of laying eggs. As to the Kametz in both words, see Ew. 100, c. The point of the comparison, that the young hatched out of another bird's eggs forsake the mother, is brought out in the application of the proverb. Hence is to be explained "forsake him:" the riches forsake him, instead of: are lost to him, vanish, in the half of his days, i.e., in the midst of life; and at the end of his life he shall be a fool, i.e., the folly of his conduct shall fully appear.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012">Jer 17:12-13</A>
<p>In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012">Jer 17:12</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013">Jer 17:13</A> Jeremiah concludes this meditation with an address to the Lord, which the Lord corroborates by His own word.
<p>Verse 12 is taken by many ancient comm. as a simple statement: a throne of glory, loftiness from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary. This is grammatically defensible; but the view preferred by almost all moderns, that it is an apostrophe, is more in keeping with the tension of feeling in the discourse. The "place of our sanctuary" is the temple as the spot where God sits throned amidst His people, not the heaven as God's throne: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001">Isa 66:1</A>. This the pronoun our does not befit, since heaven is never spoken of as the sanctuary of Israel. Hence we must refer both the preceding phrases to the earthly throne of God in the temple on Zion. The temple is in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#021">Jer 14:21</A> called throne of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, because in it Jahveh is enthroned above the ark; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022">Exo 25:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002">Psa 80:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001">Psa 99:1</A>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; has here the sig. of &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#021">Isa 40:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004">Isa 41:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026">Isa 41:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016">Isa 48:16</A> : from the beginning onwards, from all time. Heaven as the proper throne of God is often called &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, loftiness; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015">Isa 57:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#008">Psa 7:8</A>; but so also is Mount Zion as God's earthly dwelling-place; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023">Eze 17:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040">Eze 20:40</A>. Zion is called loftiness from the beginning, i.e., from immemorial time, as having been from eternity chosen to be the abode of God's glory upon earth; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017">Exo 15:17</A>, where in the song of Moses by the Red Sea, Mount Zion is pointed out prophetically as the place of the abode of Jahveh, inasmuch as it had been set apart thereto by the sacrifice of Isaac; see the expos. of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017">Exo 15:17</A>. Nor does &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; always mean the beginning of the world, but in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026">Isa 41:26</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016">Isa 48:16</A> it is used of the beginning of the things then under discussion. From the place of Jahveh's throne amongst His people, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013">Jer 17:13</A>, the discourse passes to Him who is there enthroned: Thou hope of Israel, Jahveh (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#008">Jer 14:8</A>), through whom Zion and the temple had attained to that eminence. The praise of God's throne prepares only the transition to praise of the Lord, who there makes known His glory. The address to Jahveh: Thou hope of Israel, is not a prayer directed to Him, so as to justify the objection against the vocative acceptation of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012">Jer 17:12</A>, that it were unseemly to address words of prayer to the temple. The juxtaposition of the sanctuary as the throne of God and of Jahveh, the hope of Israel, involves only that the forsaking of the sanctuary on Zion is a forsaking of Jahveh, the hope of Israel. It needs hardly be observed that this adverting to the temple as the seat of Jahve's throne, whence help may come, is not in contradiction to the warning given in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004">Jer 7:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009">Jer 7:9</A>. against false confidence in the temple as a power present to protect. That warning is aimed against the idolaters, who believed that God's presence was so bound up with the temple, that the latter was beyond the risk of harm. The Lord is really present in the temple on Zion only to those who draw near Him in the confidence of true faith. All who forsake the Lord come to shame. This word the Lord confirms through the mouth of the prophet in the second part of the verse. &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, according to the Chet., is a substantive from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, formed like &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; from &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; (cf. Ew. 162, a); the Keri &#1493;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; is partic. from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; with &#1493; cop. - an uncalled-for conjecture. My departers = those that depart from me, shall be written in the earth, in the loose earth, where writing speedily disappears. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, synonymous with &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#008">Job 14:8</A>, suggesting death. The antithesis to this is not the graving in rock, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#024">Job 19:24</A>, but being written in the book of life; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001">Dan 12:1</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032">Exo 32:32</A>. In this direction the grounding clause points: they have forsaken the fountain of living water (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013">Jer 2:13</A>); for without water one must pine and perish. - On this follows directly,
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014">Jer 17:14-16</A>
<p>The prophet's prayer for rescue from his enemies. - <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014">Jer 17:14</A>. "Heal me, Jahveh, that I may be healed; help me, that I may be holpen, for Thou art my praise. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015">Jer 17:15</A>. Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of Jahveh? let it come, now. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#016">Jer 17:16</A>. I have not withdrawn myself from being a shepherd after Thee, neither wished for the day of trouble, Thou knowest; that which went forth of my lips was open before Thy face. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#017">Jer 17:17</A>. Be not to me a confusion, my refuge art Thou in the day of evil. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018">Jer 17:18</A>. Let my persecutors be put to shame, but let not me be put to shame; let them be confounded, but let not me be confounded; bring upon them the day of evil, and break them with a double breach."
<p>The experience Jeremiah had had in his calling seemed to contradict the truth, that trust in the Lord brings blessing (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007">Jer 17:7</A>.); for his preaching of God's word had brought him nothing but persecution and suffering. Therefore he prays the Lord to remove this contradiction and to verify that truth in his case also. The prayer of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014">Jer 17:14</A>, "heal me," reminds one of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003">Psa 6:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#003">Psa 30:3</A>. Thou art &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, the object of my praises; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#006">Psa 71:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#021">Deu 10:21</A>. - The occasion for this prayer is furnished by the attacks of his enemies, who ask in scorn what then has become of that which he proclaims as the word of the Lord, why it does not come to pass. Hence we see that the discourse, of which this complaint is the conclusion, was delivered before the first invasion of Judah by the Chaldeans. So long as his announcements were not fulfilled, the unbelieving were free to persecute him as a false prophet (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#022">Deu 18:22</A>), and to give out that his prophecies were inspired by his own spite against his people. He explains, on the contrary, that in his calling he has neither acted of his own accord, nor wished for misfortune to the people, but that he has spoken by the inspiration of God alone. '&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;  cannot mean: I have not pressed myself forward to follow Thee as shepherd, i.e., pressed myself forward into Thy service in vain and overweening self-conceit (Umbr.). For although this sense would fall very well in with the train of thought, yet it cannot be grammatically justified. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, press, press oneself on to anything, is construed with &#1500;, cf.Josh. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013">Jer 10:13</A>; with &#1502;&#1503; it can only mean: press oneself away from a thing. &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; may stand for &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; , cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002">Jer 48:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023">Sa1 15:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013">Kg1 15:13</A> : from being a shepherd after Thee, i.e., I have not withdrawn myself from following after Thee as a shepherd. Against this rendering the fact seems to weigh, that usually it is not the prophets, but only the kings and princes, that are entitled the shepherds of the people; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001">Jer 23:1</A>. For this reason, it would appear, Hitz. and Graf have taken &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; in the sig. to seek after a person or thing, and have translated: I have not pressed myself away from keeping after Thee, or from being one that followed Thee faithfully. For this appeal is made to places like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020">Pro 13:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#007">Pro 28:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003">Psa 37:3</A>, where &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; does mean to seek after a thing, to take pleasure in it. But in this sig. &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is always construed with the accus. of the thing or person, not with &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;, as here. Nor does it by any means follow, from the fact of shepherds meaning usually kings or rulers, that the idea of "shepherd" is exhausted in ruling and governing people. According to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001">Psa 23:1</A>, Jahveh is the shepherd of the godly, who feeds them in green pastures and leads them to the refreshing water, who revives their soul, etc. In this sense prophets, too, feed the people, if they, following the Lord as chief shepherd, declare God's word to the people. We cannot in any case abide by Ng.'s rendering, who, taking &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; in its literal sense, puts the meaning thus: I have not pressed myself away from being a shepherd, in order to go after Thee. For the assumption that Jeremiah had, before his call, been, like Amos, a herd of cattle, contradicts <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001">Jer 1:1</A>; nor from the fact, that the cities of the priests and of the Levites were provided with grazing fields (&#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;), does it at all follow that the priests themselves tended their flocks. "The day of trouble," the ill, disastrous day, is made out by Ng. to be the day of his entering upon the office of prophet - a view that needs no refutation. It is the day of destruction for Jerusalem and Judah, which Jeremiah had foretold. When Ng. says: "He need not have gone out of his way to affirm that he did not desire the day of disaster for the whole people," he has neglected to notice that Jeremiah is here defending himself against the charges of his enemies, who inferred from his prophecies of evil that he found a pleasure in his people's calamity, and wished for it to come. For the truth of his defence, Jeremiah appeals to the omniscience of God: "Thou knowest it." That which goes from my lips, i.e., the word that came from my lips, was &#1504;&#1498; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, before or over against thy face, i.e., manifest to Thee.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#017">Jer 17:17-18</A>
<p>On this he founds his entreaty that the Lord will not bring him to confusion and shame by leaving his prophecies as to Judah unfulfilled, and gives his encouragement to pray in the clause: Thou art my refuge in the day of evil, in evil times; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011">Jer 15:11</A>. May God rather put his persecutors to shame and confusion by the accomplishment of the calamity foretold, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018">Jer 17:18</A>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; pointed with Tsere instead of the abbreviation &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;, cf. Ew. 224, c. &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; is imperat. instead of &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#040">Sa1 20:40</A>, where the Masoretes have thus pointed even the &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;. But in the Hiph. the i has in many cases maintained itself against the , so that we are neither justified in regarding the form before us as scriptio plena, nor yet in reading &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492;. - Break them with a double breach, i.e., let the disaster fall on them doubly. "A double breach," pr. something doubled in the way of breaking or demolition. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; is not subordinated to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; in stat. constr., but is added as accus. of kind; cf. Ew. 287, h.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019">Jer 17:19-25</A>
<p>Of the hallowing of the Sabbath. - <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019">Jer 17:19</A>. "Thus said Jahveh unto me: Go and stand in the gate of the sons of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in and by which they go out, and in all gates of Jerusalem, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#020">Jer 17:20</A>. And say unto them: Hear the word of Jahveh, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all inhabitants of Jerusalem, that go in by these gates: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#021">Jer 17:21</A>. Thus hath Jahveh said: Take heed for your souls, and bear no burden on the Sabbath-day, and bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#022">Jer 17:22</A>. And carry forth no burden out of your houses on the Sabbath-day, and do no work, and hallow the Sabbath-day, as I commanded your fathers. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#023">Jer 17:23</A>. But they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, and made their neck stiff, that they might not hear nor take instruction. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#024">Jer 17:24</A>. But if ye will really hearken unto me, saith Jahveh, to bring in no burden by the gates of the city on the Sabbath-day, and to hallow the Sabbath-day, to do no work thereon, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#025">Jer 17:25</A>. Then shall there go through the gates of the city kings and princes, who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ad this city shall be inhabited for ever. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#026">Jer 17:26</A>. And they shall come from the cities of Judah and the outskirts of Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin and from the lowland, from the hill-country and from the south, that bring burnt-offering and slain-offering, meat-offering and incense, and that bring praise into the house of Jahveh. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#027">Jer 17:27</A>. But if ye hearken not to me, to hallow the Sabbath-day, and not to bear a burden, and to come into the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath-day, then will I kindle fire in her gates, so that it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and not be quenched."
<p>The introduction, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019">Jer 17:19</A>, shows that this passage has, in point of form, but a loose connection with what precedes. It is, however, not a distinct and independent prophecy; for it wants the heading, "The word of Jahveh which came," etc., proper to all the greater discourses. Besides, in point of subject-matter, it may very well be joined with the preceding general reflections as to the springs of mischief and of well-being; inasmuch as it shows how the way of safety appointed to the people lies in keeping the decalogue, as exemplified in one of its fundamental precepts. - The whole passage contains only God's command to the prophet; but the execution of it, i.e., the proclamation to the people of what was commanded, is involved in the nature of the case. Jeremiah is to proclaim this word of the Lord in all the gates of Jerusalem, that it may be obeyed in them all. The locality of the gate of the sons of the people is obscure and difficult to determine, that by which the kings of Judah go and come. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1501; seems to stand for &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;, as the Keri would have it. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023">Jer 25:23</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006">Kg2 23:6</A>, "sons of the people" means the common people as opposed to the rich and the notables; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#005">Ch2 35:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#007">Ch2 35:7</A>., the people as opposed to the priests and Levites, that is, the laity. The first sig. of the phrase seems here to be excluded by the fact, that the kings come and go by this gate; for there is not the smallest probability that a gate so used could have borne the name of "gate of the common people." But we might well pause to weigh the second sig. of the word, if we could but assume that it was a gate of the temple that was meant. Ng. concludes that it was so, on the ground that we know of no city gate through which only the kings and the dregs of the people were free to go, or the kings and the mass of their subjects, to the exclusion of the priests. But this does not prove his point; for we are not informed as to the temple, that the kings and the laity were permitted to go and come by one gate only, while the others were reserved for priests and Levites. Still it is much more likely that the principal entrance to the outer court of the temple should have obtained the name of "people's gate," or "laymen's gate," than that a city gate should have been so called; and that by that "people's gate" the kings also entered into the court of the temple, while the priests and Levites came and went by side gates which were more at hand for the court of the priests. Certainly Ng. is right when he further remarks, that the name was not one in general use, but must have been used by the priests only. On the other hand, there is nothing to support clearly the surmise that the gate &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#005">Ch2 23:5</A>, was so called; the east gate of the outer court is much more likely. We need not be surprised at the mention of this chief gate of the temple along with the city gates; for certainly there would be always a great multitude of people to be found at this gate, even if what Ng. assumes were not the case, that by the sale and purchase of things used in the temple, this gate was the scene of a Sabbath-breaking trade. But if, with the majority of comm., we are to hold that by "people's gate" a city gate was meant, then we cannot determine which it was. Of the suppositions that it was the Benjamin-gate, or the well-gate, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#014">Neh 2:14</A> (Maur.), or the gate of the midst which led through the northern wall of Zion from the upper city into the lower city (Hitz.), or the water-gate, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#026">Neh 3:26</A> (Graf), each is as unfounded as another. From the plural: the kings of Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#020">Jer 17:20</A>), Hitz. infers that more kings than one were then existing alongside one another, and that thus the name must denote the members of the royal family. But his idea has been arbitrarily forced into the text. The gates of the city, as well as of the temple, did not last over the reign of but one king, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#021">Jer 17:21</A>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, to take heed for the souls, i.e., take care of the souls, so as not to lose life (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015">Mal 2:15</A>), is a more pregnant construction than that with &#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015">Deu 4:15</A>, although it yields the same sense. Ng. seeks erroneously to explain the phrase according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#010">Sa2 20:10</A> (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, take care against the sword) and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#008">Deu 24:8</A>, where &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; ought not to be joined at all with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1506;. The bearing of burdens on the Sabbath, both into the city and out of one's house, seems to point most directly at market trade and business, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015">Neh 13:15</A>., but is used only as one instance of the citizens' occupations; hence are appended the very words of the law: to do no work, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016">Exo 12:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010">Exo 20:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#014">Deu 5:14</A>, and: to hallow the Sabbath, namely, by cessation from all labour, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#024">Jer 17:24</A>. The remark in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#023">Jer 17:23</A>, that the fathers have already transgressed God's law, is neither contrary to the aim in view, as Hitz. fancies, nor superfluous, but serves to characterize the transgression censured as an old and deeply-rooted sin, which God must at length punish unless the people cease therefrom. The description of the fathers' disobedience is a verbal repetition of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#026">Jer 7:26</A>. The Chet. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1506; cannot be a participle, but is a clerical error for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506; (infin. constr. with (scriptio plena), as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#010">Jer 11:10</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015">Jer 19:15</A>. See a similar error in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025">Jer 2:25</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#006">Jer 8:6</A>. On "nor take instruction," cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030">Jer 2:30</A>.
<p>In the next verses the observance of this commandment is enforced by a representation of the blessings which the hallowing of the Sabbath will bring to the people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#024">Jer 17:24-26</A>), and the curse upon its profanation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027">Jer 2:27</A>). If they keep the Sabbath holy, the glory of the dynasty of David and the prosperity of the people will acquire permanence, and Jerusalem remain continually inhabited, and the people at large will bring thank-offerings to the Lord in His temple. Hitz., Graf, and Ng. take objection to the collocation: kings and princes (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025">Jer 2:25</A>), because princes do not sit on the throne of David, nor can they have other "princes" dependent on them, as we must assume from the "they and their princes." But although the &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; be awanting in the parallel, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#004">Jer 22:4</A>, yet this passage cannot be regarded as the standard; for whereas the discourse in Jer 22 is addressed to the king, the present is to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, or rather the people of Judah. The &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  is subordinate to the kings, so that the sitting on the throne of David is to be referred only to the kings, the following &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; helping further to define them. "Riding" is to be joined both with "in chariots" and "on horses," since &#1512;&#1499;&#1489; means either driving or riding. The driving and riding of the kings and their princes through the gates of Jerusalem is a sign of the undiminished splendour of the rule of David's race.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#026">Jer 17:26</A>
<p>Besides the blessing of the continuance of the Davidic monarchy, Jerusalem will also have to rejoice in the continued spiritual privilege of public worship in the house of the Lord. From the ends of the kingdom the people will come with offerings to the temple, to present thank-offerings for benefits received. The rhetorical enumeration of the various parts of the country appears again in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044">Jer 32:44</A>. The cities of Judah and the outskirts of Jerusalem denote the part of the country which bordered on Jerusalem; then we have the land of Benjamin, the northern province of the kingdom, and three districts into which the tribal domain of Judah was divided: the Shephelah in the west on the Mediterranean Sea, the hill-country, and the southland; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021">Jos 15:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033">Jos 15:33</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048">Jos 15:48</A>. The desert of Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#061">Jos 15:61</A>) is not mentioned, as being comprehended under the hill-country. The offerings are divided into two classes: bloody, burnt and slain offerings, and unbloody, meat-offerings and frankincense, which was strewed upon the meat-offering (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001">Lev 2:1</A>). The latter is not the incense-offering (Graf), which is not called &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, but &#1511;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514;, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007">Exo 30:7</A>., although frankincense was one of the ingredients of the incense prepared for burning (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034">Exo 30:34</A>). These offerings they will bring as "praise-offering" into the house of the Lord. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; is not here used for &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, praise-offering, as one species of slain-offering, but is, as we see from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011">Jer 33:11</A>, a general designation for the praise and thanks which they desire to express by means of the offerings specified.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#027">Jer 17:27</A>
<p>In the event of the continuance of this desecration of the Sabbath, Jerusalem is to be burnt up with fire, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014">Jer 21:14</A>, and, as regards the expressions used, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#014">Amo 1:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014">Hos 8:14</A>.
