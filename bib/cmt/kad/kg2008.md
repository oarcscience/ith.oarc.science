[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 8:1</span></span>

Elisha's Influence Helps the Shunammite to the Possession of her House
and Field. - [Kg2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md), [Kg2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#002.md). By the advice of Elisha, the
woman whose son the prophet had restored to life ([Kg2
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#033).md) had gone with her family into
the land of the Philistines during a seven years' famine, and had
remained there seven years. The two verses are rendered by most
commentators in the pluperfect, and that with perfect correctness, for
they are circumstantial clauses, and ותּקם is merely a continuation of
דּבּר, the two together preparing the way for, and introducing the
following event. The object is not to relate a prophecy of Elisha of the
seven years' famine, but what afterwards occurred, namely, how king
Joram was induced by the account of Elisha's miraculous works to have
the property of the Shunammite restored to her upon her application. The
seven years' famine occurred in the middle of Joram's reign, and the
event related here took place before the curing of Naaman the Syrian (2
Kings 5), as is evident from the fact that Gehazi talked with the king
([Kg2 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#004).md), and therefore had not yet
been punished with leprosy. But it cannot have originally stood between
[Kg2 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#037.md) and [Kg2
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md), as Thenius supposes, because the
incidents related in [Kg2 4:38-44](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md)
belong to the time of this famine (cf. [Kg2
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038).md), and therefore precede the
occurrence mentioned here. By the words, "the Lord called the famine,
and it came seven years" (sc., lasting that time), the famine is
described as a divine judgment for the idolatry of the nation.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 8:3</span></span>

When the woman returned to her home at the end of the seven years, she
went to the king to cry, i.e., to invoke his help, with regard to her
house and her field, of which, as is evident from the context, another
had taken possession during her absence.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 8:4</span></span>

And just at that time the king was asking Gehazi to relate to him the
great things that Elisha had done; and among these he was giving an
account of the restoration of the Shunammite's son to life.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 8:5</span></span>

While he was relating this, the woman herself came into invoke the help
of the king to recover her property, and was pointed out to the king by
Gehazi as the very woman of whom he was speaking, which caused the king
to be so interested in her favour, that after hearing her complaint he
sent a chamberlain with her (saris as in [Kg1
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#009).md), with instructions to procure
for her not only the whole of her property, but the produce of the land
during her absence. - For עזבה without mappiq, see Ewald, 247, d.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 8:7</span></span>

Elisha Predicts to Hazael at Damascus the Possession of the Throne. -
[Kg2 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#007.md). Elisha then came to Damascus
at the instigation of the Spirit of God, to carry out the commission
which Elijah had received at Horeb with regard to Hazael ([Kg1
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#015).md). Benhadad king of Syria was
sick at that time, and when Elisha's arrival was announced to him, sent
Hazael with a considerable present to the man of God, to inquire of
Jehovah through him concerning his illness. The form of the name חזהאל
(here and [Kg2 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#015).md) is etymologically
correct; but afterwards it is always written without .ה דם וכל־טוּב
("and that all kinds of good of Damascus") follows with a more precise
description of the minchah - "a burden of forty camels." The present
consisted of produce or wares of the rich commercial city of Damascus,
and was no doubt very considerable; at the same time, it was not so
large that forty camels were required to carry it. The affair must be
judged according to the Oriental custom, of making a grand display with
the sending of presents, and employing as many men or beasts of burden
as possible to carry them, every one carrying only a single article (cf.
Harmar, Beobb. ii. p. 29, iii. p. 43, and Rosenmller, A. u. N. Morgenl.
iii. p. 17).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 8:10</span></span>

According to the Chethb חיה לא, Elisha's answer was, "Thou wilt not
live, and (for) Jehovah has shown me that he will die;" according to the
Keri חיה לו, "tell him: Thou wilt live, but Jehovah," etc. Most of the
commentators follow the ancient versions, and the Masoretes, who reckon
our לא among the fifteen passages of the O.T. in which it stands for the
pronoun לו (vid., Hilleri Arcan. Keri, p. 62f.), and some of the
codices, and decide in favour of the Keri. (1) because the conjecture
that לו was altered into לא in order that Elisha might not be made to
utter an untruth, is a very natural one; and (2) on account of the
extreme rarity with which a negative stands before the inf. abs. with
the finite verb following. But there is not much force in either
argument. The rarity of the position of לא before the inf. abs. followed
by a finite verb, in connection with the omission of the pronoun לו
after אמר, might be the very reason why לא was taken as a pronoun; and
the confirmation of this opinion might be found in the fact that Hazael
brought back this answer to the king: "Thou wilt live" ([Kg2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#014).md). The reading in the text לא
(non) is favoured by the circumstance that it is the more difficult of
the two, partly because of the unusual position of the negative, and
partly because of the contradiction to [Kg2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#014.md). But the לא is found in the same
position in other passages ([Gen 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#004.md);
[Psa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008.md), and [Amo
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008).md), where the emphasis lies upon the
negation; and the contradiction to [Kg2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#014.md) may be explained very simply,
from the fact that Hazael did not tell his king the truth, because he
wanted to put him to death and usurp the throne. We therefore prefer the
reading in the text, since it is not in harmony with the character of
the prophets to utter an untruth; and the explanation, "thou wilt not
die of thine illness, but come to a violent death," puts into the words
a meaning which they do not possess. For even if Benhadad did not die of
his illness, he did not recover from it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 8:11</span></span>

Elisha then fixed Hazael for a long time with his eye, and wept. וגו
ויּעמד literally, he made his face stand fast, and directed it (upon
Hazael) to shaming. עד־בּשׁ as in [Jdg
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#025.md); not in a shameless manner
(Thenius), but till Hazael was embarrassed by it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 8:12</span></span>

When Hazael asked him the cause of his weeping, Elisha replied: "I know
the evil which thou wilt do to the sons of Israel: their fortresses wilt
thou set on fire (בּאשׁ שׁלּח, see at [Jdg
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008).md), their youths wilt thou slay with
the sword, and wilt dash their children to pieces, and cut asunder their
women with child" (בּקּע, split, cut open the womb). This cruel conduct
towards Israel which is here predicted of Hazael, was only a special
elaboration of the brief statement made by the Lord to Elijah concerning
Hazael ([Kg1 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#017).md). The fulfilment of
this prediction is indicated generally in [Kg2
10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md), and [Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003.md).; and we may infer with certainty
from [Hos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md) and [Hos
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001.md), that Hazael really practised the
cruelties mentioned.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 8:13</span></span>

But when Hazael replied in feigned humility, What is thy servant, the
dog (i.e., so base a fellow: for כּלב see at [Sa1
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#015).md), that he should do such great
things? Elisha said to him, "Jehovah has shown thee to me as king over
Aram;" whereupon Hazael returned to his lord, brought him the pretended
answer of Elisha that he would live (recover), and the next day
suffocated him with a cloth dipped in water. מכבּר, from כּבר, to plait
or twist, literally, anything twisted; not, however, a net for gnats or
flies (Joseph., J. D. Mich., etc.), but a twisted thick cloth, which
when dipped in water became so thick, that when it was spread over the
face of the sick man it was sufficient to suffocate him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 8:16</span></span>

Reign of Joram of Judah (cf. 2 Chron 21:2-20). - Joram became king in
the fifth year of Joram of Israel, while Jehoshaphat his father was
(still) king, the latter handing over the government to him two years
before his death (see at [Kg2 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#017).md),
and reigned eight years, namely, two years to the death of Jehoshaphat
and six years afterwards.

(Note: The words יהוּדה מלך ויהושׁפט have been improperly omitted by the
Arabic and Syriac, and by Luther, Dathe, and De Wette from their
translations; whilst Schulz, Maurer, Thenius, and others pronounce it a
gloss. The genuineness of the words is attested by the lxx (the Edit.
Complut. being alone in omitting them) and by the Chaldee: and the
rejection of them is just as arbitrary as the interpolation of מת, which
is proposed by Kimchi and Ewald ("when Jehoshaphat was dead"). Compare
J. Meyer, annotatt. ad Seder Olam, p. 916f.)

The Chethb שׁנה שׁמנה is not to be altered, since the rule that the
numbers two to ten take the noun in the plural is not without exception
(cf. Ewald, 287, i.).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 8:18</span></span>

Joram had married a daughter of Ahab, namely Athaliah ([Kg2
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026).md), and walked in the ways of the
house of Ahab, transplanting the worship of Baal into his kingdom.
Immediately after the death of Jehoshaphat he murdered his brothers,
apparently with no other object than to obtain possession of the
treasures which his father had left them ([Ch2
21:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002).md). This wickedness of Joram
would have been followed by the destruction of Judah, had not the Lord
preserved a shoot to the royal house for David's sake. For ניר לו לתת
see [Kg1 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#036.md). The following word
לבניו serves as an explanation of ניר לו, "a light with regard to his
sons," i.e., by the fact that he kept sons (descendants) upon the
throne.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 8:20</span></span>

Nevertheless the divine chastisement was not omitted. The ungodliness of
Joram was punished partly by the revolt of the Edomites and of the city
of Libnah from his rule, and partly by a horrible sickness of which he
died ([Ch2 21:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012).md). Edom, which had
hitherto had only a vicegerent with the title of king (see [Kg2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#009.md) and [Kg1
22:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#048).md), threw off the authority of
Judah, and appointed its own king, under whom it acquired independence,
as the attempt of Joram to bring it back again under his control
completely failed. The account of this attempt in [Kg2
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#021.md) and [Ch2
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#009.md) is very obscure. "Joram went over
to Zair, and all his chariots of war with him; and it came to pass that
he rose up by night and smote the Edomites round about, and indeed the
captains of the war-chariots, and the people fled (i.e., the Judaean men
of war, not the Edomites) to their tents." It is evident from this, that
Joram had advanced to Zair in Idumaea; but there he appears to have been
surrounded and shut in, so that in the night he fought his way through,
and had reason to be glad that he had escaped utter destruction, since
his army fled to their homes. צעירה is an unknown place in Idumaea,
which Movers, Hitzig, and Ewald take to be Zoar, but without considering
that Zoar was in the land of Moab, not in Edom. The Chronicles have
instead שׂריו עם, "with his captains," from a mere conjecture; whilst
Thenius regards צעירה as altered by mistake from שׂעירה ("to Seir"),
which is very improbable in the case of so well-known a name as שׂעיר.
הסּביב is a later mode of writing for הסּובב, probably occasioned by the
frequently occurring word סביב. "To this day," i.e., to the time when
the original sources of our books were composed. For the Edomites were
subjugated again by Amaziah and Uzziah ([Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md) and [Kg2
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022).md), though under Ahaz they made
incursions into Judah again ([Ch2
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017).md). - At that time Libnah also
revolted. This was a royal city of the early Canaanites, and at a later
period it was still a considerable fortress ([Kg2
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008).md). It is probably to be sought for
in the ruins of Arak el Menshiyeh, two hours to the west of Beit-Jibrin
(see the Comm. on [Jos 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029).md). This
city probably revolted from Judah on the occurrence of an invasion of
the land by the Philistines, when the sons of Joram were carried off,
with the exception of the youngest, Jehoahaz (Ahaziah: [Ch2
21:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 8:23</span></span>

According to [Ch2 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#018.md)., Joram died
of a terrible disease, in which his bowels fell out, and was buried in
the city of David, though not in the family sepulchre of the kings.

(Note: "The building of Carthage, Dido, her husband Sichaeus, her
brother Pygmalion king of Tyre (scelere ante alios immanior omnes), all
coincide with the reign of Joram. This synchronism of the history of
Tyre is not without significance here. The Tyrian, Israelitish, and
Judaean histories are closely connected at this time. Jezebel, a Tyrian
princess, was Ahab's wife, and again her daughter Athaliah was the wife
of Joram, and after his death the murderess of the heirs of the kingdom,
and sole occupant of the throne. Tyre, through these marriages,
introduced its own spirit and great calamity into both the Israelitish
kingdoms." - J. D. Michaelis on [Kg2
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#024)..md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 8:25</span></span>

Reign of Ahaziah of Judah (cf. [Ch2
22:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001).md). - Ahaziah, the youngest son
of Joram, ascended the throne in the twenty-second year of his age. The
statement in [Ch2 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002.md), that he was
forty-two years old when he became king, rests upon a copyist's error,
namely, a confusion of כ twenty with מ forty. Now, since his father
became king at the age of thirty-two, and reigned eight years, Ahaziah
must have been born in the nineteenth year of his age. Consequently it
may appear strange that Ahaziah had brothers still older than himself
([Ch2 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017).md); but as early marriages
are common in the East, and the royal princes had generally concubines
along with their wife of the first rank, as is expressly stated of Joram
in [Ch2 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017.md), he might have had some
sons in his nineteenth year. His mother was called Athaliah, and was a
daughter of the idolatrous Jezebel. In [Kg2
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026.md) and [Ch2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002.md) she is called the daughter, i.e.,
grand-daughter, of Omri; for, according to [Kg2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018.md), she was a daughter of Ahab.
Omri, the grand-father, is mentioned in [Kg2
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026.md) as the founder of the dynasty
which brought so much trouble upon Israel and Judah through its
idolatry.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 8:27</span></span>

Ahaziah, like his father, reigned in the spirit of Ahab, because he
allowed his mother to act as his adviser ([Ch2
22:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#003).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 8:28</span></span>

Ahaziah went with Joram of Israel, his mother's brother, to the war with
the Syrians at Ramoth. The contest for this city, which had already cost
Ahab his life (1 Kings), was to furnish the occasion, according to the
overruling providence of God, for the extermination of the whole of
Omri's family. Being wounded in the battle with the Syrians, Joram king
of Israel returned to Jezreel to be healed of his wounds. His nephew
Ahaziah visited him there, and there he met with his death at the same
time as Joram at the hands of Jehu, who had conspired against Joram (see
[Kg2 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#014.md). and [Ch2
22:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#007).md). Whether the war with Hazael
at Ramoth was for the recapture of this city, which had been taken by
the Syrians, or simply for holding it against the Syrians, it is
impossible to determine. All that we can gather from [Kg2
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#014.md) is, that at that time Ramoth was
in the possession of the Israelites, whether it had come into their
possession again after the disgraceful rout of the Syrians before
Samaria (2 Kings 7), or whether, perhaps, it was not recovered till this
war. For ארמּים without the article see Ewald, 277, c.
