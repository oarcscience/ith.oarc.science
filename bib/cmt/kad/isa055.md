### [Isaiah Chapter 55](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 55:1</span></span>

All things are ready; the guests are invited; and nothing is required of
them except to come. "Alas, all ye thirsty ones, come ye to the water;
and ye that have no silver, come ye, buy, and eat! Yea, come, buy wine
and milk without money and without payment! Wherefore do ye weigh silver
for that which is not bread, and the result of your labour for that
which satisfieth not? O hearken ye to me, and eat the good, and let your
soul delight itself in fat." Hitzig and Knobel understand by water,
wine, and milk, the rich material blessings which awaited the exiles on
their return to their fatherland, whereas they were now paying tribute
and performing service inf Babylon without receiving anything in return.
But the prophet was acquainted with something higher than either natural
water ([Isa 54:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#003.md), cf., [Isa
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017).md) or natural wine ([Isa
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006).md). He knew of an eating and
drinking which reached beyond the mere material enjoyment ([Isa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013).md); and the expression ה טּוּב,
whilst it includes material blessings ([Jer
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#012).md), is not exhausted by them ([Isa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007.md), cf., [Psa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013).md), just as התענּג in [Isa
58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014.md) (cf., [Psa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004.md), [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011).md) does not denote a feeling or
worldly, but of spiritual joy. Water, wine, and milk, as the fact that
water is placed first clearly shows, are not the produce of the Holy
Land, but figurative representations of spiritual revival, recreation,
and nourishment (cf., [Pe1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002.md), "the
sincere milk of the word"). The whole appeal is framed accordingly. When
Jehovah summons the thirsty ones of His people to come to the water, the
summons must have reference to something more than the water to which a
shepherd leads his flock. And as buying without money or any other
medium of exchange is an idea which neutralizes itself in the sphere of
natural objects, wine and ilk are here blessings and gifts of divine
grace, which are obtained by grace (χάριτι, gratis), their reception
being dependent upon nothing but a sense of need, and a readiness to
accept the blessings offered. Again, the use of the verb שׁברוּ, which
is confined in other passages to the purchase of cereals, is a
sufficient proof that the reference is not to natural objects, but to
such objects as could properly be compared to cereals. The bread and
other provisions, which Israel obtained in its present state of
punishment, are called "not bread," and "not serving to satisfy,"
because that which truly satisfies the soul comes from above, and being
of no earthly nature, is to be obtained by those who are the most
destitute of earthly supplies. Can any Christian reader fail to recall,
when reading the invitation in [Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md), the words of the parable in [Mat
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004.md), "All things are now ready?" And
does not [Isa 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md) equally suggest the
words of Paul in [Rom 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006.md), "If by
grace, then is it no more of works?" Even the exclamation hoi (alas! see
[Isa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001).md), with which the passage
commences, expresses deep sorrow on account of the unsatisfied thirst,
and the toilsome labour which affords nothing but seeming satisfaction.
The way to true satisfaction is indicated in the words, "Hearken unto
me:" it is the way of the obedience of faith. In this way alone can the
satisfaction of the soul be obtained.

[Isaiah 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 55:3</span></span>

And in this way it is possible to obtain not only the satisfaction of
absolute need, but a superabundant enjoyment, and an overflowing
fulfilment of the promise. "Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and
let your soul revive; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,
the true mercies of David. Behold, I have set him as a witness for
nations, a prince and commander of nations. Behold, thou wilt call a
mass of people that thou knowest not; and a mass of people that knoweth
thee not will hasten to thee, for the sake of Jehovah thy God, and for
the Holy One of Israel, that He hath made thee glorious." The expression
"make a covenant" (kârath berı̄th) is not always applied to a superior in
relation to an inferior (compare, on the contrary, [Ezr
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#003).md); but here the double-sided idea
implied in pactio is confined to one side alone, in the sense of a
spontaneous sponsio having all the force of a covenant ([Isa
61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008.md); compare [Ch2
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#018.md), where kârath by itself signifies
"to promise with the force of a covenant"), and also of the offer of a
covenant or anticipated conclusion of a covenant, as in [Eze
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md), and in the case before us,
where "the true mercies of David" are attached to the idea of offering
or granting involved in the expression, "I will make an everlasting
covenant with you," as a more precise definition of the object. All that
is required on the part of Israel is hearing, and coming, and taking:
let it do this, and it will be pervaded by new life; and Jehovah will
meet with with an everlasting covenant, viz., the unchangeable mercies
of David. Our interpretation of this must be dependent chiefly upon
whether [Isa 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md) is regarded as
looking back to the history of David, or looking forward to something
future. In the latter case we are either to understand by "David" the
second David (according to [Hos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md);
[Jer 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md); [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024).md), so that the allusion is to the
mercies granted in the Messiah, and according to [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md), enduring "from henceforth even
for ever;" or else David is the son of Jesse, and "the mercies of David"
are the mercies bestowed upon him, which are called "the true mercies"
as mercies promised and running into the future ([Psa
89:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#050.md); [Ch2
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042).md), in which case [Isa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md) explains what David will become
in the person of his antitype the second David. The directly Messianic
application of the name "David" is to be objected to, on the ground that
the Messiah is never so called without further remark; whilst the
following objections may be adduced to the indirectly Messianic
interpretation of [Isa 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md) (David in
the Messiah). (1.) The change of the tense in [Isa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md), [Isa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005.md), which requires that we should
assume that [Isa 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md) points backwards
into the past, and [Isa 55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005.md) forwards
into the future.

(Note: F. Philippi observes that הן, which refers to the future in [Isa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005.md) at any rate, must be taken as
referring to the same sphere of time as that which immediately precedes.
But hēn in Isaiah points sometimes backwards ([Isa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001.md); [Isa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004).md), sometimes forwards; and where
two follow one another, of which the one points backwards and the other
forwards, the former is followed by the perfect, the latter by the
future ([Isa 50:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001).md). But if they both
point to the future, the future tense is used in both instances ([Isa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009).md). A better argument in favour of
the prophetic interpretation of [Isa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md) might be drawn from the fact that
נתתּי הן may mean "I give (set, lay, or make) even now" (e.g., [Jer
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#009).md). But what we have said above is
sufficient proof that this is not the meaning here (if this were the
meaning, we should rather expect נתתּיו הן).)

(2.) That the choice of the expression in [Isa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md), [Isa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005.md) is designed to represent what
Israel has to look for in the future as going beyond what was
historically realized in David; for in [Isa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005.md) the mass of the heathen world,
which has hitherto stood out of all relation to Israel, answers to the
לאמּים. (3.) That the juxtaposition of the Messiah and Israel would be
altogether without parallel in these prophecies (chapters 40-66), and
contrary to their peculiar character; for the earlier stereotype idea of
the Messiah is here resolved into the idea of the "servant of Jehovah,"
from which it returns again to its primary use, i.e., from the national
basis to the individual, by means of the ascending variations through
which this expression passes, and thus reaches a more comprehensive,
spiritual, and glorified form. The personal "servant of Jehovah" is
undoubtedly no other than the "Son of David" of the earlier prophecy;
but the premises, from which we arrive at this conclusion in connection
with our prophet, are not that the "servant of Jehovah" is of the seed
of David and the final personal realization of the promise of a future
king, but that he is of the nation of Israel, and the final personal
realization of the idea of Israel, both in its inward nature, and in its
calling in relation to the whole world of nations.

Consequently [Isa 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md) and [Isa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005.md) stand to one another in the
relation of type and antitype, and the "mercies of David" are called
"the true mercies" (Probably with an allusion to [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md); cf., [Psa
89:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029).md), as being inviolable-mercies
which had both been realized in the case of David himself, and would be
realized still further, inasmuch as they must endure for an everlasting
future, and therefore be further and further fulfilled, until they have
reached that lofty height, on the summit of which they will remain
unchangeable for ever. It is of David the son of Jesse that Jehovah says
in [Isa 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md), "I have given him for a
witness to peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples." So far as
the sense is concerned, נגיד is as much a construct as מצוּה. In the
application to David of the term עד, which never means anything but
testis, witness, in these prophecies, we may clearly see the bent of the
prophet's mind towards what is spiritual. David had subdued nations by
the force of arms, but his true and loftiest greatness consisted in the
fact that he was a witness of the nations - a witness by the victorious
power of his word, the conquering might of his Psalms, the attractive
force of his typical life. What he expresses so frequently in the Psalms
as a resolution and a vow, viz., that he will proclaim the name of
Jehovah among the nations ([Psa 18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050.md);
[Psa 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010).md), he has really fulfilled:
he has not only overcome them by bloody warfare, but by the might of his
testimony, more especially as "the sweet psalmist of Israel" ([Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001).md). What David himself was able to
say in [Psa 18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043.md), "People that I did
not know served me," will be fulfilled to a still wider extent in the
experience of Israel. Having been presented with the promised
"inviolable mercies of David," it will effect a spiritual conquest over
the heathen world, even over that portion which has hitherto stood in no
reciprocal relation to it, and gain possession of it for itself for the
sake of Jehovah, whom it has for its God, and to the Holy One of Israel
(ל of the object, in relation to which, or at the instigation of which,
anything is done), because He hath glorified it (His people: פארך is not
a pausal form for פארך, cf., [Isa
54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006.md), but for פארך, פארך, hence =
פארך, cf., ענך, [Isa 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019).md); so that
joining themselves to Israel is the same as joining themselves to God
and to the church of the God of revelation (cf., [Isa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009.md), where [Isa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005.md) is repeated almost word for
word).

[Isaiah 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 55:6</span></span>

So gracious is the offer which Jehovah now makes to His people, so great
are the promises that He makes to it, viz., the regal glory of David,
and the government of the world by virtue of the religion of Jehovah.
Hence the exhortation is addressed to it in [Isa
55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006.md) and [Isa
55:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#007.md) : "Seek ye Jehovah while He may
be found, call ye upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his
way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return to
Jehovah, and He will have compassion upon him; and to our God, for He
will abundantly pardon." They are to seek to press into the fellowship
of Jehovah (dârash with the radical meaning terere, to acquire
experimental knowledge or confidential acquaintance with anything) now
that He is to be found ([Isa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md),
compare the parallelism of words and things in [Jer
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014).md), and to call upon Him, viz.,
for a share in that superabundant grace, ow that He is near, i.e., now
that He approaches Israel, and offers it. In the admonition to
repentance introduced in [Isa 55:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#007.md),
both sides of the μετάνοια find expression, viz., turning away from
sinful self-will, and turning to the God of salvation. The apodosis with
its promises commences with וירחמהוּ - then will He have compassion upon
such a man; and consequently לסלוח כּי־ירבּה (with כּי because the
fragmentary sentence ואל־אלהינוּ did not admit of the continuation with
ו) has not a general, but an individual meaning (vid., [Psa
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md), [Psa
130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007).md), and is to be translated as a
future (for the expression, compare [Isa
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 55:8</span></span>

The appeal, to leave their own way and their own thoughts, and yield
themselves to God the Redeemer, and to His word, is now urged on the
ground of the heaven-wide difference between the ways and thoughts of
this God and the despairing thoughts of men ([Isa
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#027.md); [Isa
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024).md), and their aimless labyrinthine
ways. "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
ways, saith Jehovah: no, heaven is high above the earth; so high are my
ways above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts." The kı̄ (imo)
introduces the undeniable statement of a fact patent to the senses, for
the purpose of clearly setting forth, by way of comparison, the relation
in which the ways and thoughts of God stand to those of man. There is no
necessity to supply כאשׁר after כּי, as Hitzig and Knobel do. It is
simply omitted, as in [Isa 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md) and
[Jer 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020.md), or like כּן in [Pro
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011.md), etc. On what side the
heaven-wide elevation is to be seen, is shown in what follows. They are
not so fickle, so unreliable, or so powerless.

[Isaiah 55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 55:10</span></span>

This is set forth under a figure drawn from the rain and the snow. "For
as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not
thither, till it has moistened the earth, and fertilized it, and made it
green, and offered seed to the sower and bread to the eater; so will my
word be which goeth forth out of my mouth: it will not return to me
fruitless, till it has accomplished that which I willed, and
prosperously carried out that for which I sent it." The rain and snow
come down from the sky, and return not thither till they have .... The
perfects after אם כּי are all to be understood as such (Ewald, 356, a).
Rain and snow return as vapour to the sky, but not without having first
of all accomplished the purpose of their descent. And so with the word
of Jehovah, which goeth forth out of His mouth (יצא, not יצא, [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md), because it is thought of as
still going on in the preaching of the prophet): it will not return
without having effected its object, i.e., without having accomplished
what was Jehovah's counsel, or "good pleasure" - without having attained
the end for which it was sent by Jehovah (constr. as in [Sa2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#022.md); [Kg1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#006).md). The word is represented in
other places as the messenger of God ([Isa
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008.md); [Psa
107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md); [Psa
147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015)..md). The personification
presupposes that it is not a mere sound or letter. As it goeth forth out
of the mouth of God it acquires shape, and in this shape is hidden a
divine life, because of its divine origin; and so it runs, with life
from God, endowed with divine power, supplied with divine commissions,
like a swift messenger through nature and the world of man, there to
melt the ice, as it were, and here to heal and to save; and does not
return from its course till it has given effect to the will of the
sender. This return of the word to God also presupposes its divine
nature. The will of God, which becomes concrete and audible in the word,
is the utterance of His nature, and is resolved into that nature again
as soon as it is fulfilled. The figures chosen are rich in analogies. As
snow and rain are the mediating causes of growth, and therefore the
enjoyment of what is reaped; so is the soil of the human heart softened,
refreshed, and rendered productive or prolific by the word out of the
mouth of Jehovah; and this word furnishes the prophet, who resembles the
sower, with the seed which he scatters, and brings with it bread which
feeds the souls: for every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
is bread ([Deu 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 55:12</span></span>

The true point of comparison, however, is the energy with which the word
is realized. Assuredly and irresistibly will the word of redemption be
fulfilled. "For ye will go out with joy, and be led forth in peace: the
mountains and the hills will break out before you into shouting, and all
the trees of the field will clap their hands. Instead of the thorn will
cypresses shoot up, and instead of the fleabane will myrtles shoot up:
and it will be to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting memorial that
will not be swept away." "With joy," i.e., without the hurry of fear
([Isa 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012).md); "in peace," i.e.,
without having to fight their way through or flee. The idea of the
sufferer falls back in הוּבל behind that of a festal procession ([Psa
45:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#015).md). In applying the term kaph
(hand) to the trees, the prophet had in his mind their kippōth, or
branches. The psalmist in [Psa 98:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#008.md)
transfers the figure created by our prophet to the waves of the streams.
Na‛ătsūts (from nâ‛ats, to sting) is probably no particular kind of
thorn, such, for example, as the fuller's thistle, but, as in [Isa
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#019.md), briers and thorns generally. On
sirpad, see Ges. Thes.; we have followed the rendering, κόυζα, of the
lxx. That this transformation of the vegetation of the desert is not to
be taken literally, any more than in [Isa
41:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017.md), is evident from the shouting
of the mountains, and the clapping of hands on the part of the trees. On
the other hand, however, the prophet says something more than that
Israel will return home with such feelings of joy as will cause
everything to appear transformed. Such promises as those which we find
here and in [Isa 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#019.md) and [Isa
35:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md), and such exhortations as those
which we find in [Isa 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023.md); [Isa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013.md), and [Isa
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#009.md), arise from the consciousness,
which was common to both prophets and apostles, that the whole creation
will one day share in the liberty and glory of the children of God ([Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021).md). This thought is dressed up
sometimes in one for, and sometimes in another. The psalmists after the
captivity borrowed the colours in which they painted it from our prophet
(see at [Psa 96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md) and [Psa
98:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001).md). והיה is construed as a neuter
(cf., בּראתיו, [Isa 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008).md), referring
to this festal transformation of the outer world on the festive return
of the redeemed. אות is treated in the attributive clause as a
masculine, as if it came from אוּת, to make an incision, to crimp, as we
have already indicated; but the Arabic âyat, shows that it comes from
אוה, to point out, and is contracted from ăwăyat, and therefore was
originally a feminine.
