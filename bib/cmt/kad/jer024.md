### [Jeremiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 24:1</span></span>

The Two Fig Baskets-an emblem of the future of Judah's people. - [Jer
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md). "Jahveh caused me to see, and
behold two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jahveh, after
Nebuchadrezzar had carried captive Jechoniah, the son of Jehoiakim, king
of Judah, and the princes of Judah, and the work-people and the smiths
from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. [Jer
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002.md). One basket had very good figs
like the early figs, the other basket very bad figs, which could not be
eaten for badness. [Jer 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#003.md). And
Jahveh said to me: What seest thou, Jeremiah? and I said: Figs; the good
figs are very good, and the bad figs very bad, which cannot be eaten for
badness. [Jer 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#004.md). Then came the word
of Jahveh unto me, saying: [Jer 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005.md).
Thus saith Jahveh, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I
look on the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into
the land of the Chaldeans, for good; [Jer
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006.md). And I will set mine eye upon
them for good, and will bring them back again to this land, and build
them and not pull down, and plant them and not pluck up. [Jer
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#007.md). And I give them an heart to know
me, that I am Jahveh; and they shall be my people, and I will be their
God; for they will return unto me with their whole heart. [Jer
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008.md). And as the bad figs, which
cannot be eaten for badness, yea thus saith Jahveh, so will I make
Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes and the residue of
Jerusalem, them that are left remaining in this land and them that dwell
in Egypt. [Jer 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md). I give them up
for ill-usage, for trouble to all kingdoms of the earth, for a reproach
and a by-word, for a taunt and for a curse in all the places whither I
shall drive them. [Jer 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#010.md). and I
send among them the sword, the famine, and the plague, till they be
consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers."

This vision resembles in form and substance that in [Amo
8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md). The words: Jahveh caused me to
see, point to an inward event, a seeing with the eyes of the spirit, not
of the body. The time is, [Jer 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md),
precisely given: after Nebuchadnezzar had carried to Babylon King
Jechoniah, with the princes and a part of the people; apparently soon
after this deportation, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the
king set up by Nebuchadnezzar over Judah. Cf. [Kg2
24:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md). - The Lord caused the
prophet to see in spirit two baskets of figs (דּוּדאים, from דּוּדי,
equivalent to דּוּד, [Jer 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002).md),
מוּעדים (from יעד) in the place appointed therefor (מועד( rofereh)
before the temple. We are not to regard these figs as an offering
brought to Jahveh (Graf); and so neither are we to think here of the
place where first-fruits or tithes were offered to the Lord, [Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md)., [Deu
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md). The two baskets of figs have
nothing to do with first-fruits. They symbolize the people, those who
appear before the Lord their God, namely, before the altar of
burnt-offering; where the Lord desired to appear to, to meet with His
people (נועד, [Exo 29:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#042)..md), so as to
sanctify it by His glory, [Exo 29:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043.md).
מוּעדים therefore means: placed in the spot appointed by the Lord for
His meeting with Israel.

[Jeremiah 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 24:2</span></span>

"The one basket very good figs" is short for: the basket was quite full
of very good figs; cf. Friedr. W. M. Philippi, on the Nature and Origin
of the Status constr. in Hebrew (1871), p. 93. The comparison to early
figs serves simply to heighten the idea of very good; for the first
figs, those ripened at the end of June, before the fruit season in
August, were highly prized dainties. Cf. [Isa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004.md); [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md).

[Jeremiah 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 24:3</span></span>

The question: what seest thou? serves merely to give the object seen
greater prominence, and does not imply the possibility of seeing wrong
(Ng.).

[Jeremiah 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 24:4</span></span>

The interpretation of the symbol. [Jer
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005.md). Like the good figs, the Lord
will look on the captives in Chaldea for good ("for good" belongs to the
verb "look on them"). The point of resemblance is: as one looks with
pleasure on good figs, takes them and keeps them, so will I bestow my
favour on Judah's captives. Looking on them for good is explained, [Jer
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006.md) : the Lord will set His eye on
them, bring them back into their land and build them up again. With
"build them," etc., cf. [Jer 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md). The
building and planting of the captives is not to consist solely in the
restoration of their former civil well-being, but will be a spiritual
regeneration of the people. God will give them a heart to know Him as
their God, so that they may be in truth His people, and He their God.
"For they will return," not: when they return (Ew., Hitz.). The turning
to the Lord cannot be regarded as the condition of their receiving
favour, because God will give them a heart to know Him; it is the
working of the knowledge of the Lord put in their hearts. And this is
adduced to certify the idea that they will then be really the Lord's
people.

[Jeremiah 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 24:8</span></span>

And as one deals with the bad uneatable figs, i.e., throws them away, so
will the Lord deliver up to ignominious ruin Zedekiah with his princes
and the remainder of the people, both those still staying in the land
and those living in Egypt. This, the fate awaiting them, is more fully
described in [Jer 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md) and [Jer
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#010.md). In [Jer
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008.md) the "yea, thus saith," is
inserted into the sentence by way of repetition of the "thus saith,"
[Jer 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005.md). כּן is resumed and expanded
by וּנתתּים in [Jer 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md). The
"princes" are Zedekiah's courtiers. Those in Egypt are they who during
the war had fled thither to hide themselves from judgment. From the
beginning of [Jer 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md) to הארץ is
verbally the same as [Jer 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004.md), save
that לרעה is added to make more marked the contrast to לטובּהּ, [Jer
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005.md) - the evil, namely, that is done
to them. Hitz., Ew., Umbr., Gr., following the lxx, delete this word,
but without due cause. The further description of the ill-usage in "for
a reproach," etc., is based on [Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037.md); and is intensified by the
addition of "and for an object of cursing," to show that in their case
the curse there recorded will be fulfilled. From the last words,
according to which disgrace will light on them in all the lands they are
driven into, it appears that captivity will fall to the lot of such as
are yet to be found in the land. But captivity involves new hostile
invasions, and a repeated siege and capture of Jerusalem; during which
many will perish by sword, famine, and plague. Thus and by deportation
they shall be utterly rooted out of the land of their fathers. Cf. [Jer
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#017.md)., where Jeremiah repeats the
main idea of this threatening.
