### [Ezekiel Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md)

The Restoration and Blessing of Israel

[Eze 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md). And thou, son of man,
prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, Mountains of Israel, hear
the word of Jehovah: [Eze 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#002.md). Thus
saith the Lord Jehovah, Because the enemy saith concerning you, Aha! the
everlasting heights have become ours for a possession: [Eze
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003.md). Therefore prophesy, and say,
Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because, even because they lay you waste,
and pant for you round about, so that ye have become a possession to the
remnant of the nations, and have come to the talk of the tongue and
gossip of the people: [Eze 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#004.md).
Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah:
Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and hills, to the low
places and valleys, and to the waste ruins and the forsaken cities,
which have become a prey and derision to the remnant of the nations
round about; [Eze 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005.md). Therefore thus
saith the Lord Jehovah, Truly in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken
against the remnant of the nations, and against Edom altogether, which
have made my land a possession for themselves in all joy of heart, in
contempt of soul, to empty it out for booty. [Eze
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#006.md). Therefore prophesy concerning
the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the low
places and valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, in my jealousy
and fury have I spoken, because ye have borne the disgrace of the
nations. [Eze 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#007.md). Therefore thus
saith the Lord Jehovah, I, I have lifted up my hand; truly the nations
round about you, they shall bear their disgrace. [Eze
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#008.md). But ye, ye mountains of Israel,
shall put forth your branches, and bear your fruit to my people Israel;
for they will soon come. [Eze 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#009.md).
For, behold, I will deal with you, and turn toward you, and ye shall be
tilled and sown. [Eze 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#010.md). I will
multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel at once; and the cities
shall be inhabited, and the ruins built. [Eze
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#011.md). And I will multiply upon you
man and beast; they shall multiply and be fruitful: and I will make you
inhabited as in your former time, and do more good to you than in your
earlier days; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. [Eze
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#012.md). I will cause men, my people
Israel, to walk upon you; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be
an inheritance to them, and make them childless no more. [Eze
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#013.md). Thus saith the Lord Jehovah,
Because they say to you, "Thou art a devourer of men, and hast made thy
people childless;" [Eze 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#014.md).
Therefore thou shalt no more devour men, and no more cause thy people to
stumble, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. [Eze
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#015.md). And I will no more cause thee
to hear the scoffing of the nations, and the disgrace of the nations
thou shalt bear no more, and shalt no more cause thy people to stumble,
is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.

This prophecy is uttered concerning the land of Israel, as is plainly
declared in [Eze 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#006.md); whereas in [Eze
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md) and [Eze
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#004.md) the mountains of Israel are
mentioned instead of the land, in antithesis to the mountains of Seir
([Eze 35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md); see the comm. on [Eze
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#012).md). The promise takes throughout
the form of antithesis to the threat against Edom in [Eze
35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md). Because Edom rejoices that
the Holy Land, which has been laid waste, has fallen to it for a
possession, therefore shall the devastated land be cultivated and sown
again, and be inhabited by Israel as in the former time. The heathen
nations round about shall, on the other hand, bear their disgrace; Edom,
as we have already observed, being expanded, so far as the idea is
concerned, into all the heathen nations surrounding Israel ([Eze
36:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003).md). In [Eze
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#002.md), האויב, the enemy, is mentioned
in quite a general manner; and what has already been stated concerning
Edom in [Eze 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005.md) and [Eze
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010.md), is her predicted of the enemy.
In [Eze 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003.md) and [Eze
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#004.md) this enemy is designated as a
remnant of the heathen nations; and it is not till [Eze
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005.md) that it is more precisely defined
by the clause, "and all Edom altogether." The גּוים round about (אשׁר,
[Eze 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#004.md), compared with [Eze
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003).md) are the heathen nations which
are threatened with destruction in Ezekiel 25 and 26, on account of
their malicious rejoicing at the devastation of Jerusalem and Judah.
This serves to explain the fact that these nations are designated as
שׁארית הגּוים, the rest, or remnant of the heathen nations, which
presupposes that the judgment has fallen upon them, and that only a
remnant of them is left, which remnant desires to take possession of the
devastated land of Israel. The epithet applied to this land, בּמות,
everlasting, i.e., primeval heights, points back to the גּבעות עולם of
[Gen 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#026.md) and [Deu
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#015.md), and is chosen for the purpose
of representing the land as a possession secured to the people of Israel
by primeval promises, in consequence of which the attempt of the enemy
to seize upon this land has become a sin against the Lord God. The
indignation at such a sin is expressed in the emotional character of the
address. As Ewald has aptly observed, "Ezekiel is seized with unusual
fire, so that after the brief statement in [Eze
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#002.md) 'therefore' is repeated five
times, the charges brought against these foes forcing themselves in
again and again, before the prophecy settles calmly upon the mountains
of Israel, to which it was really intended to apply." For יען בּיען, see
the comm. on [Eze 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010.md). שׁמּות is an
infinitive Kal, formed after the analogy of the verbs ה'ל (cf. Ewald,
238e), from שׁמם, to be waste, to devastate, as in [Dan
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md); [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md); [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), and is not to be taken in the
sense of נשׁם, after [Isa 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014.md), as
Hitzig supposes. שׁאף, to pant for a thing; here it is equivalent to
snapping at anything. This is required by a comparison with [Eze
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#004.md), where היה לבז corresponds to
שׁמּות ושׁאף, and ללעג to 'תּעלוּ על שׂפת וגו. In the connection שׂפת
לשׁון, שׂפה signifies the lip as an organ of speech, or, more precisely,
the words spoken; and לשׁון, the tongue, is personified, and stands for
אישׁ לשׁון ([Psa 140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012).md), a
tongue-man, i.e., a talker.

In [Eze 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#004.md) the idea expressed in
"the mountains of Israel" is expanded into mountains, hills, lowlands,
and valleys (cf. [Eze 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md); [Eze
32:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#005).md); and this periphrastic
description of the land is more minutely defined by the additional
clause, "waste ruins and forsaken cities." אם לא in [Eze
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005.md) is the particle used in oaths
(cf. [Eze 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#011), etc..md); and the perfect
דּבּרתּי is not merely prophetic, but also a preterite. God has already
uttered a threatening word concerning the nations round about in Ezekiel
25, 26, and [Eze 35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md); and here He
once more declares that they shall bear their disgrace. אשׁ קנאח is the
fiery jealousy of wrath. כּלּא is an Aramean form for כּלּהּ ([Eze
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015).md). For בשׁאט נפשׁ, see [Eze
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006.md). In the expression למען מגרשׁהּ
לבז noisserp, which has been rendered in various ways, we agree with
Gesenius and others in regarding מגרשׁ as an Aramean form of the
infinitive of גּרשׁ, with the meaning to empty out, which is confirmed
by the Syriac; for מגרשׁ cannot be a substantive, on account of the
למען; and Hitzig's conjecture, that לבז should be pointed לבז, and the
clause rendered "to plunder its produce," is precluded by the fact that
the separation of the preposition למען ל, by the insertion of a word
between, is unexampled, to say nothing of the fact that מגרשׁ does not
mean produce at all. The thought expressed in [Eze
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#006.md) and [Eze
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#007.md) is the following: because Israel
has hitherto borne the contempt of the heathen, the heathen shall now
bear their own contempt. The lifting of the hand is a gesture employed
in taking an oath, as in [Eze 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006.md),
etc. But the land of Israel is to receive a blessing. This blessing is
described in [Eze 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#008.md) in general
terms, as the bearing of fruit by the mountains, i.e., by the land of
Israel; and its speedy commencement is predicted. It is then depicted in
detail in [Eze 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#009.md). In the clause כּי
קרבוּ לבוא, the Israelites are not to be regarded as the subject, as
Kliefoth supposes, in which case their speedy return from exile would be
announced. The כּי shows that this cannot be the meaning; for it is
immediately preceded by 'לעמּי ישׁ' yb , which precludes the supposition
that, when speaking of the mountains, Ezekiel had the inhabitants in his
mind. The promised blessings are the subject, or the branches and
fruits, which the mountains are to bear. Nearly all the commentators
have agreed in adopting this explanation of the words, after the analogy
of [Isa 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md). With the כּי in [Eze
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#009.md) the carrying out of the blessing
promised is appended in the form of a reason assigned for the general
promise. The mountains shall be cultivated, the men upon them, viz., all
Israel, multiplied, the desolated cities rebuilt, so that Israel shall
dwell in the land as in the former time, and be fruitful and blessed.
This promise was no doubt fulfilled in certain weak beginnings after the
return of a portion of the people under Zerubbabel and Ezra; but the
multiplying and blessing, experienced by those who returned from
Babylon, did not take place till long after the salvation promised here,
and more especially in [Eze 36:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#012.md).

According to [Eze 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#012.md), the land is
to become the inheritance of the people Israel, and will no more make
the Israelites childless, or (according to [Eze
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#014).md) cause them to stumble; and the
people are no more to bear the contempt of the heathen. But that portion
of the nation which returned from exile not only continued under the
rule of the heathen, but had also in various ways to bear the contempt
of the heathen still; and eventually, because Israel not only stumbled,
but fell very low through the rejection of its Saviour, it was scattered
again out of the land among the heathen, and the land was utterly
wasted...until this day. In [Eze 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#012.md)
the masculine suffix attached to וירשׁוּך refers to the land regarded as
הר, which is also the subject to היית and תּוסף. It is not till [Eze
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#013.md), [Eze
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#014.md), where the idea of the land
becomes so prominent, that the feminine is used. שׁכּלם, to make them
(the Israelites) childless, or bereaved, is explained in [Eze
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#013.md), [Eze
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#014.md) by אכלת, devouring men. That the
land devours its inhabitants, is what the spies say of the land of
Canaan in [Num 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md); and in [Kg2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#019.md) is it affirmed of the district of
Jericho that it causes משׁכּלת, i.e., miscarriages, on account of its
bad water. The latter passage does not come into consideration; but the
former ([Num 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032).md) probably does, and
Ezekiel evidently refers to this. For there is no doubt whatever that he
explains or expands שׁכּלם by אכלת אדם yb. Although, for example, the
charge that the land devours men is brought against it by the enemies or
adversaries of Israel (אמרים לּכם, they say to you), the truth of the
charge is admitted, since it is said that the land shall henceforth no
more devour men, though without a repetition of the שׁכּל. But the sense
in which Ezekiel affirms of the land that it had been אכלת אדם, and was
henceforth to be so no more, is determined by וגויך לא תכשׁלי אוד, thou
wilt no more cause thy people to stumble, which is added in [Eze
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#014.md) in the place of משׁכּלת גּויך
היית in [Eze 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#014.md). Hence the land
became a devourer of men by the fact that it caused its people to
stumble, i.e., entangled them in sins (the Keri תּשׁכּלי for תכשׁלי is a
bad conjecture, the incorrectness of which is placed beyond all doubt by
the לא־תכשׁלי עוד of [Eze 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#015).md).
Consequently we cannot understand the "devouring of men," after [Num
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md), as signifying that, on account
of its situation and fruitfulness, the land is an apple of discord, for
the possession of which the nations strive with one another, so that the
inhabitants are destroyed, or at all events we must not restrict the
meaning to this; and still less can we agree with Ewald and Hitzig in
thinking of the restless hurrying and driving by which individual men
were of necessity rapidly swept away. If the sweeping away of the
population so connected with the stumbling, the people are devoured by
the consequences of their sins, i.e., by the penal judgment,
unfruitfulness, pestilence, and war, with which God threatened Israel
for its apostasy from Him. These judgments had depopulated the land; and
this fact was attributed by the heathen in their own way to the land,
and thrown in the teeth of the Israelites as a disgrace. The Lord will
henceforth remove this charge, and take away from the heathen all
occasion to despise His people, namely, by bestowing upon His land and
people the blessing which He promised in the law to those who kept His
commandments. But this can only be done by His removing the occasion to
stumble or sin, i.e., according to [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md). (compared with [Eze
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#018)..md), by His cleansing His people
from all uncleanness and idols, and giving them a new heart and a new
spirit. The Keri גּוייך in [Eze 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#013.md),
[Eze 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#014.md), and [Eze
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#015.md) is a needless alteration of the
Chetib גּויך. - In [Eze 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#015.md) this
promise is rounded off and concluded by another summing up of the
principal thoughts.

[Ezekiel 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 36:16</span></span>

The Salvation of Israel Founded upon Its Sanctification

Because Israel has defiled its land by its sins, God has scattered the
people among the heathen; but because they also profaned His name among
the heathen, He will exercise forbearance for the sake of His holy name
([Eze 36:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#016).md), will gather Israel
out of the lands, cleanse it from its sins, and sanctify it by the
communication of His Spirit, so that it will walk in His ways ([Eze
36:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022).md), and will so bless and
multiply it, that both the nations around and Israel itself will know
that He is the Lord ([Eze 36:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#029).md). -
This promise is shown by the introductory formula in [Eze
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#016.md) and by the contents to be an
independent word of God; but it is substantially connected in the
closest manner with the preceding word of God, showing, on the one hand,
the motive which prompted God to restore and bless His people;, and, on
the other hand, the means by which He would permanently establish the
salvation predicted in Ezekiel 34 and [Eze
36:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md). - The kernel of this promise
is formed by [Eze 36:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md), for which
the way is prepared in [Eze 36:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017.md),
whilst the further extension is contained in [Eze
36:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#029.md).

[Eze 36:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#016.md)

The Lord will extend His forbearance, for the sake of His holy name, to
the people who have been rejected on account of their sins. - [Eze
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#016.md). And the word of Jehovah came to
me, saying, [Eze 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017.md). Son of man,
the house of Israel dwelt in its land, and defiled it with its way and
its doings; like the uncleanness of the unclean woman, was its way
before me. [Eze 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#018.md). Then I poured
out my fury upon them on account of the blood which they had shed in the
land, and because they had defiled it through their idols, [Eze
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#019.md). And scattered them among the
nations, and they were dispersed in the land; according to their way and
their doings I judge them. [Eze 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020.md).
And they came to the nations whither they came, and profaned my holy
name, for men said of them, "These are Jehovah's people, and they have
come out of His land." [Eze 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#021.md). And
so I had pity upon my holy name, which the house of Israel profaned
among the nations whither they came. - The address commences with a
description of the reasons why God had thrust out His people among the
heathen, namely, on account of their sins and idolatrous abominations,
by which the Israelites had defiled the land (cf. [Lev
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028.md) and [Num
35:34](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#034).md). Their conduct resembled the
most offensive uncleanness, namely, the uncleanness of a woman in her
menstruation ([Lev 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019).md), to which
the moral depravity of the people had already been compared in [Isa
64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md). - In [Eze
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#018.md) the consequence of the defiling
of the land by the people is introduced with the impression ואשׁפּך. In
[Eze 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017.md), ויטמּאוּ is the
continuation of the participle ישׁבים; and the participle is expressive
of the condition in the past, as we may see from the words 'ואשׁפּך וגו.
The simile in [Eze 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017.md) is an
explanatory, circumstantial clause. For [Eze
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#018.md), compare [Eze
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#008.md), and for 'על הדּם וגו, [Eze
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003.md), [Eze
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006.md). The last clause, "and through
their idols they have defiled it," is loosely appended; but it really
contains a second reason for the pouring out of the wrath of God upon
the people. For [Eze 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#019.md), compare
[Eze 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#015.md). ויּבוא in [Eze
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020.md) refers to בּית־ישׂראל; but there
is no necessity to read ויבאוּ on that account. It is perfectly
arbitrary to supply the subject proposed by Kliefoth, viz., "the report
of what had happened to Israel" came to the heathen, which is quite
foreign to the connection; for it was not the report concerning Israel,
but Israel itself, which came to the heathen, and profaned the sacred
name of God. This is not only plainly expressed in [Eze
36:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#021.md), but has been already stated in
[Eze 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020.md). The fact that the words of
the heathen, by which the name of God was profaned, are quoted here,
does not prove that it is the heathen nations who are to be regarded as
those who profaned the name of God, as Kliefoth imagines. The words,
"these are Jehovah's people, and have come out of His (Jehovah's) land,"
could only contain a profanation of the holy name of God, if their
coming out was regarded as involuntary, i.e., as an exile enforced by
the power of the heathen; or, on the other hand, if the Israelites
themselves had denied the holiness of the people of God through their
behaviour among the heathen. Most of the commentators have decided in
favour of the former view. Vatablus, for example, gives this
explanation: "if their God whom they preach had been omnipotent, He
would not have allowed them to be expelled from His land." And we must
decide in favour of this exposition, not only because of the parallel
passages, such as [Num 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#016.md) and [Jer
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#024.md), which support this view; but
chiefly on account of the verses which follow, according to which the
sanctification of the name of God among the nations consists in the fact
that God gathers Israel out of its dispersion among the nations, and
leads them back into His own land (vid., [Eze
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023.md) and [Eze
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#024).md). Consequently the profanation
of His name can only have consisted in the fact that Israel was carried
away out of its own land, and scattered in the heathen lands. For, since
the heathen acknowledged only national gods, and regarded Jehovah as
nothing more than such a national god of Israel, they did not look upon
the destruction of the kingdom of Judah and the carrying away of the
people as a judgment of the almighty and holy God upon His people, but
concluded that that catastrophe was a sign of the inability of Jehovah
to defend His land and save His people. The only way in which God could
destroy this delusion was by manifesting Himself to the heathen as the
almighty God and Lord of the whole world through the redemption and
glorification of His people. ואחמל על־שׁם ק: so I had pity, compassion
upon my holy name. The preterite is prophetic, inasmuch as the
compassion consists in the gathering of Israel out of the nations, which
is announced in [Eze 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022.md). as still
in the future. The rendering, "I spared (them) for my holy name's sake"
(lxx, Hvernick), is false; for חמל is construed with על, governing the
person or the thing toward which the compassion is shown (vid., [Eze
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005.md) and [Ch2
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015.md), [Ch2
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017).md).

[Eze 36:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022.md)

For His holy name's sake the Lord will bring Israel back from its
dispersion into His own land, purify it from its sins, and sanctify it
by His Spirit to be His own people. - [Eze
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022.md). Therefore say to the house of
Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I do it not for your sakes, O house
of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the
nations whither ye have come. [Eze
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023.md). I will sanctify my great name,
which is profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst
of them, so that the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, is the saying
of the Lord Jehovah, when I prove myself holy upon you before their
eyes. [Eze 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#024.md). I will take you out
of the nations, and gather you out of all lands, and bring you into your
land, [Eze 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md). And will sprinkle
clean water upon you, that ye may become clean; from all your
uncleannesses and from all your idols will I cleanse you, [Eze
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026.md). And I will give you a new
heart, and give a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone
out of your flesh, and give you a heart of flesh. [Eze
36:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#027.md). I will put my Spirit within
you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and keep my rights, and do
them. [Eze 36:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#028.md). And ye shall dwell
in the land which I have given to your fathers, and shall become my
people, and I will be your God. - These verses show in what way the Lord
will have compassion upon His holy name, and how He will put an end to
the scoffing thereat, and vindicate His honour in the sight of the
heathen. "Nor for your sake," i.e., not because you have any claim to
deliverance on account of your behaviour (cf. [Isa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md) and [Deu
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#006).md), but for my holy name's sake,
i.e., to manifest as holy the name which has been profaned among the
heathen, I do it, namely, what follows from [Eze
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023.md) onwards. The Lord will sanctify
His name, i.e., show it to be holy by proving Himself to be holy upon
Israel. קדּשׁ is not equivalent to glorify, although the holiness of God
involves the idea of glory. Sanctifying is the removing or expunging of
the blots and blemishes which adhere to anything. The giving up of His
people was regarded by the heathen as a sign of the weakness of Jehovah.
This blot through which His omnipotence and glory were dishonoured, God
would remove by gathering Israel out of the heathen, and glorifying it.
Instead of לעיניכם, the ancient versions have rendered לעיניהם. This
reading is also found in many of the codices and the earliest editions,
and is confirmed by the great Masora, and also commended by the parallel
passages, [Eze 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#041.md) and [Eze
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025.md), so that it no doubt deserves
the preference, although לעיניכם can also be justified. For inasmuch as
Israelites had despaired in the midst of their wretchedness through
unbelief, it was necessary that Jehovah should sanctify His great name
in their sight as well. The great name of Jehovah is His almighty
exaltation above all gods (cf. [Mal
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011).md). The first thing that Jehovah
does for the sanctification of His name is to bring back Israel from its
dispersion into its own land ([Eze
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#024.md), compare [Eze
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#017.md) and [Eze
20:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#041).md); and then follows the
purifying of Israel from its sins. The figurative expression, "to
sprinkle with clean water," is taken from the lustrations prescribed by
the law, more particularly the purifying from defilement from the dead
by sprinkling with the water prepared from the ashes of a red heifer
([Num 19:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#017.md); compare [Psa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#009).md). Cleansing from sins, which
corresponds to justification, and is not to be confounded with
sanctification (Schmieder), is followed by renewal with the Holy Spirit,
which takes away the old heart of stone and puts within a new heart of
flesh, so that the man can fulfil the commandments of God, and walk in
newness of life ([Eze 36:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026.md);
compare [Eze 11:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#018.md), where this
promise has already occurred, and the necessary remarks concerning its
fulfilment have been made). - With regard to the construction 'עשׂה את
אשׁר , to make or effect your walking, compare Ewald, ֗337b.

[Eze 36:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#029.md)

The Lord will richly bless, multiply, and glorify His people, when thus
renewed and sanctified. - [Eze 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#029.md).
And I will save you from all your uncleannesses, and will call the corn,
and multiply it, and no more bring famine upon you; [Eze
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#030.md). But I will multiply the fruit
of the tree and the produce of the field, so that ye will no more bear
the reproach of famine among the nations. [Eze
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031.md). But ye will remember your evil
ways, and your deeds which were not good, and will loathe yourselves on
account of your iniquities and your abominations. [Eze
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#032.md). Not for your sake do I this, is
the saying of the Lord Jehovah, be this known to you; be ye ashamed and
blush for your ways, O house of Israel! [Eze
36:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#033.md). Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, In
the day when I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will make
the cities inhabited, and the ruins shall be built, [Eze
36:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#034.md). And the devastated land shall
be tilled instead of being a desert before the eyes of every one who
passed by. [Eze 36:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#035.md). And men will
say, This land, which was laid waste, has become like the garden of
Eden, and the desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.
[Eze 36:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#036.md). And the nations, which
have been left round about you, shall know that I Jehovah build up that
which is destroyed, and plant that which is laid waste. I, Jehovah, have
said it, and do it. [Eze 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#037.md). Thus
saith the Lord Jehovah, I will still let myself be sought by the house
of Israel in this, to do it for them; I will multiply them, like a
flock, in men; [Eze 36:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#038.md). Like a
flock of holy sacrifices, like the flock of Jerusalem on its feast-days,
so shall the desolate cities be full of flocks of men; and they shall
know that I am Jehovah. - The words 'הושׁעתּי , I help or save you from
all your uncleannesses, cannot be understood as relating to their
purification from the former uncleannesses; for they have already been
cleansed from these, according to [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md). The טמאות can only be such
defilements as are still possible even after the renewing of the people;
and הושׁע, to help, means to guard them against any further recurrence
of such defilements (cf. [Eze 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023).md),
and not to deliver them from the consequences of their former
pollutions. But if God preserves His people from these, there is no
longer any occasion for a fresh suspension of judgments over them, and
God can bestow His blessing upon the sanctified nation without reserve.
It is in this way that the further promises are appended; and, first of
all, in [Eze 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#029.md) and [Eze
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#030.md), a promise that He will bless
them with an abundant crop of fruits, both of the orchard and the field.
"I call to the corn," i.e., I cause it to come or grow, so that famine
will occur no more (for the fact, compare [Eze
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#029).md).

In consequence of this blessing, Israel will blush with shame at the
thought of its former sins, and will loathe itself for those
abominations ([Eze 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031).md); compare
[Eze 20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043.md), where the same thought has
already occurred. To this, after repeating what has been said before in
[Eze 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022.md), namely, that God is not
doing all this for the sake of the Israelites themselves, the prophet
appends the admonition to be ashamed of their conduct, i.e., to repent,
which is so far inserted appropriately in the promise, that the promise
itself is meant to entice Israel to repent and return to God. Then,
secondly, in two strophes introduced with 'כּה אמר יי, the promise is
still further expanded. In [Eze
36:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#033.md), the prophet shows how the
devastated land is to be restored and rebuilt, and to become a paradise;
and in [Eze 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#037.md) and [Eze
36:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#038.md), how the people are to be
blessed through a large increase in their numbers. Both of these
strophes are simply a further elaboration of the promise contained in
[Eze 36:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#009.md). הושׁיב, causative of
ישׁב, to cause to be inhabited, to populate, as in [Isa
54:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#003.md). לעיני כּל־עובר, as in [Eze
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#014.md). The subject to ואמרוּ in [Eze
36:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#035.md) is, "those who pass by." For the
comparison to the garden of Eden, see [Eze
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009.md). בּצוּרות is a circumstantial
word belonging to ישׁבוּ: they shall be inhabited as fortified cities,
that is to say, shall afford to their inhabitants the security of
fortresses, from which there is no fear of their being expelled. In [Eze
36:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#036.md) the expression, "the heathen
nations which shall be left round about you," presupposes that at the
time of Israel's redemption the judgment will have fallen upon the
heathen (compare [Eze 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#003.md) with [Eze
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#021).md), so that only a remnant of them
will be still in existence; and this remnant will recognise the work of
Jehovah in the restoration of Israel. This recognition, however, does
not involve the conversion of the heathen to Jehovah, but is simply
preparatory to it. For the fact itself, compare [Eze
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#024.md). הדּרשׁ, to let oneself be asked
or entreated, as in [Eze 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003.md). זאת,
with regard to this, is explained by לעשׂות . What God will do follows
in 'ארבּה ותו. God will multiply His people to such an extent, that they
will resemble the flock of lambs, sheep, and goats brought to Jerusalem
to sacrifice upon the feast days. Compare [Ch2
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#007.md), where Josiah is said to have
given to the people thirty thousand lambs and goats for the feast of the
passover. כּצּאן אדם does not mean, like a flock of men. אדם cannot be a
genitive dependent upon צאן, on account of the article in כּצּאן, but
belongs to ארבּה, either as a supplementary apposition to אותם, or as a
second object, so that ארבּה would be construed with a double
accusative, after the analogy of verbs of plenty, to multiply them in
men. Kliefoth's rendering,, "I will multiply them, so that they shall be
the flock of men" (of mankind), is grammatically untenable. צאן קדשׁים,
a flock of holy beasts, i.e., of sacrificial lambs. The flock of
Jerusalem is the flock brought to Jerusalem at the yearly feasts, when
the male population of the land came to the sanctuary ([Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016).md): So shall the desolate cities
be filled again with flocks of men (compare [Mic
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012).md).
