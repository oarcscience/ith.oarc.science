The Curse of Alienation from God, and the Blessing of Fellowship with
Him

The preceding Psalm, in the hope of speedy deliverance, put into the
lips of the friends of the new kingship, who were now compelled to keep
in the background, the words: "Jahve, be magnified, who hath pleasure in
the well-being of His servant." David there calls himself the servant of
Jahve, and in the inscription to [Psa
36:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md) he bears the very same name:
To the Precentor, by the servant of Jahve, by David. The textus receptus
accents למנצח with a conjunctive Illuj; Ben-Naphtali accents it less
ambiguously with a disjunctive Legarme (vid., Psalter, ii. 462), since
David is not himself the מנצח. [Psa
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md); [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) ([Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001).md), [Psa
36:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md), Ps 37, form a group. In These
Psalms David complains of the moral corruption of his generation. They
are all merely reflections of the character of the time, not of
particular occurrences. In common with [Psa
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md), the Psalm before us has a
prophetic colouring; and, in common with Ps 37, allusions to the
primeval history of the Book of Genesis. The strophe schema is 4. 5. 5.
6. 6.

[Psalms 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 36:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 36:1-4) At the outset the poet discovers to us the wickedness of
the children of the world, which has its roots in alienation from God.
Supposing it were admissible to render [Psa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002.md) : "A divine word concerning the
evil-doing of the ungodly is in the inward parts of my heart" (נאם with
a genitive of the object, like משּׂא, which is compared by Hofmann),
then the difficulty of this word, so much complained of, might find the
desired relief in some much more easy way than by means of the
conjecture proposed by Diestel, נעם (נעם), "Pleasant is transgression to
the evil-doer," etc. But the genitive after נאם (which in [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md); [Num
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md)., 15f., [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md); [Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md), just as here, stands at the head
of the clause) always denotes the speaker, not the thing spoken. Even in
[Isa 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md) שׁירת דודי לכרמו is not a
song concerning my beloved in relation to His vineyard, but a song of my
beloved (such a song as my beloved has to sing) touching His vineyard.
Thus, therefore, פּשׁע must denote the speaker, and לרשׁע, as in [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) לאדני, the person or thing
addressed; transgression is personified, and an oracular utterance is
attributed to it. But the predicate בּקרב לבּי, which is intelligible
enough in connection with the first rendering of פשׁע as genit. obj., is
difficulty and harsh with the latter rendering of פשׁע as gen. subj.,
whatever way it may be understood: whether, that it is intended to say
that the utterance of transgression to the evil-doer is inwardly known
to him (the poet), or it occupies and affects him in his inmost parts.
It is very natural to read לבּו, as the lxx, Syriac, and Arabic
versions, and Jerome do. In accordance therewith, while with Von
Lengerke he takes נאם as part of the inscription, Thenius renders it:
"Sin is to the ungodly in the midst of his heart," i.e., it is the
inmost motive or impulse of all that he thinks and does. But this
isolation of נאם is altogether at variance with the usage of the
language and custom. The rendering given by Hupfeld, Hitzig, and at last
also by Bצttcher, is better: "The suggestion of sin dwells in the
ungodly in the inward part of his heart;" or rather, since the idea of
בקרב is not central, but circumferential, in the realm of (within) his
heart, altogether filling up and absorbing it. And in connection with
this explanation, it must be observed that this combination בקרב לבו
(instead of בקרבו, or בלבו, בלבבו) occurs only here, where, together
with a personification of sin, an incident belonging to the province of
the soul's life, which is the outgrowth of sin, is intended to be
described. It is true this application of נאם does not admit of being
further substantiated; but נאם (cognate נהם, המה), as an onomatopoetic
designation of a dull, hollow sound, is a suitable word for secret
communication (cf. Arabic nemmâm, a tale-bearer), or even - since the
genius of the language does not combine with it the idea of that which
is significantly secretly, and solemnly silently communicated, but
spoken out - a suitable word for that which transgression says to the
ungodly with all the solemn mien of the prophet or the philosopher,
inasmuch as it has set itself within his heart in the place of God and
of the voice of his conscience. לרשׁע does not, however, denote the
person addressed, but, as in [Psa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010.md), the possessor. He possesses
this inspiration of iniquity as the contents of his heart, so that the
fear of God has no place therein, and to him God has no existence
(objectivity), that He should command his adoration.

Since after this נאם פּשׁע we expect to hear further what and how
transgression speaks to him, so before all else the most probable thing
is, that transgression is the subject to החליק. We do not interpret: He
flatters God in His eyes (with eye-service), for this rendering is
contrary both to what precedes and to what follows; nor with Hupfeld
(who follows Hofmann): "God deals smoothly (gently) with him according
to his delusions," for the assumption that החליק must, on account of
בּעיניו, have some other subject that the evil-doer himself, is indeed
correct. It does not, however, necessarily point to God as the subject,
but, after the solemn opening of [Psa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002.md), to transgression, which is
personified. This addresses flattering words to him (אל like על in [Pro
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#005).md) in his eyes, i.e., such as are
pleasing to him; and to what end? For the finding out, i.e.,
establishing (מצא עון, as in [Gen
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#016.md); [Hos
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009).md), or, - since this is not exactly
suited to פשׁע as the subject, and where it is a purpose that is spoken
of, the meaning assequi, originally proper to the verb מצא, is still
more natural - to the attainment of his culpability, i.e., in order that
he may inculpate himself, to hating, i.e., that he may hate God and man
instead of loving them. לשׂנא is designedly used without an object just
as in [Ecc 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#008.md), in order to imply that
the flattering words of פשׁע incite him to turn into an object of hatred
everything that he ought to love, and to live and move in hatred as in
his own proper element. Thenius endeavours to get rid of the harshness
of the expression by the following easy alteration of the text: למצא עון
ולשׂנא; and interprets it: Yea, it flatters him in his own eyes (it
tickles his pride) to discover faults in others and to make them suffer
for them. But there is no support in the general usage of the language
for the impersonal rendering of the החליק; and the בּעיניו, which in
this case is not only pleonastic, but out of place, demands a
distinction between the flatterer and the person who feels himself
flattered. The expression in [Psa
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#003.md), in whatever way it may be
explained, is harsh; but David's language, whenever he describes the
corruption of sin with deep-seated indignation, is wont to envelope
itself in such clouds, which, to our difficult comprehension, look like
corruptions of the text. In the second strophe the whole language is
more easy. להשׂכּיל להיטיב is just such another asyndeton as למצא עונו
לשׂנא. A man who has thus fallen a prey to the dominion of sin, and is
alienated from God, has ceased (חדל ל, as in [Sa1
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#013).md) to act wisely and well (things
which essentially accompany one another). His words when awake, and even
his thoughts in the night-time, run upon און ([Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007).md), evil, wickedness, the absolute
opposite of that which alone is truly good. Most diligently does he take
up his position in the way which leads in the opposite direction to that
which is good ([Pro 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#029.md); [Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002).md); and his conscience is deadened
against evil: there is not a trace of aversion to it to be found in him,
he loves it with all his soul.

[Psalms 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 36:5</span></span>

(Heb.: 36:6-10) The poet now turns from this repulsive prospect to one
that is more pleasing. He contemplates, and praises, the infinite, ever
sure mercy of God, and the salvation, happiness, and light which spring
from it. Instead of בּשּׁמים, the expression is בּהשּׁמים, the syncope
of the article not taking place. בּ alternating with עד, cf. [Psa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011.md), has here, as in [Psa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005.md); [Psa
72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016.md), the sense of touching or
reaching to the spot that is denoted in connection with it. The poet
describes the exaltation and super-eminence of divine mercy and
faithfulness figuratively, after earthly standards. They reveal
themselves on earth in a height that reaches to the heavens and extends
to שׁחקים, i.e., the thin veil of vapour which spreads itself like a
veil over the depths of the heavens; they transcend all human thought,
desire, and comprehension ([Psa
103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011.md), and cf. [Eph
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018)). The צדקה (righteousness.md) is
distinguished from the אמונה (faithfulness) thus: the latter is governed
by the promises of God, the former by His holiness; and further, the
latter has its being in the love of God, the former, on the other hand,
manifests itself partly as justifying in mercies, and partly as avenging
in wrath. Concerning the righteousness, the poet says that it is like
the mountains of God, i.e., (cf. cedars of God, [Psa
80:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#011).md) unchangeably firm ([Psa
111:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#003).md), like the giant primeval
mountains which bear witness to the greatness and glory of God;
concerning God's judgments, that they are "a great deep,"
incomprehensible and unsearchable (ἀνεξερεύνηται, [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033).md) as the great, deep-surging mass
of waters in the lower parts of the earth, which becomes visible in the
seas and in the rivers. God's punitive righteousness, as at length
becomes evident, has His compassion for its reverse side; and this, as
in the case of the Flood (cf. [Jon
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011).md), embraces the animal world,
which is most closely involved, whether for weal or for woe, with man,
as well as mankind.

Lost in this depth, which is so worthy of adoration, the Psalmist
exclaims: How precious (cf. [Psa
139:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017).md) is Thy mercy, Elohim! i.e.,
how valuable beyond all treasures, and how precious to him who knows how
to prize it! The Waw of וּבני is the explicative Waw = et hoc ipsum
quod. The energetic form of the future, יחסיוּן, has the pre-tonic
Kametz, here in pause, as in [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md); [Psa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md); [Psa
78:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#044.md). The shadow of God's wings is
the protection of His love, which hides against temptation and
persecution. To be thus hidden in God is the most unspeakable
blessedness, [Psa 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md) : they satiate
themselves, they drink full draughts of "the fatness of Thy house." The
house of God is His sanctuary, and in general the domain of His mercy
and grace. דּשׁן (cf. טוּב, [Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005).md)
is the expression for the abundant, pleasant, and powerful gifts and
goods and recreations with which God entertains those who are His; and
רוה (whence ירוין, as in [Deu 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#013.md);
[Isa 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018).md) is the spiritual joy of
the soul that experiences God's mercy to overflowing. The abundant fare
of the priests from Jahve's table (vid., [Jer
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#014).md), and the festive joy of the
guests at the shelamim-offering, i.e., the communion-offering, - these
outward rites are here treated according to their spiritual
significance, receive the depth of meaning which radically belongs to
them, and are ideally generalized. It is a stream of pleasures (עדנים)
with which He irrigates and fertilizes them, a paradisaic river of
delights. This, as the four arms of the river of Paradise had one common
source ([Gen 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#010).md), has its spring in
God, yea, God is the fountain itself. He is "the fountain of life" ([Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013).md); all life flows forth from Him,
who is the absolutely existing and happy One. The more inwardly,
therefore, one is joined to Him, the fuller are the draughts of life
which he drinks from this first fountain of all life. And as God is the
fountain of life, so also is He the fountain of light: "In Thy light do
we see light;" out of God, seeing we see only darkness, whereas immersed
in God's sea of light we are illumined by divine knowledge, and lighted
up with spiritual joy. The poet, after having taken a few glimpses into
the chaos of evil, here moves in the blessed depths of holy mysticism
\[Mystik, i.e., mysticism in the good sense - true religion, vital
godliness\], and in proportion as in the former case his language is
obscure. So here it is clear as crystal.

[Psalms 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 36:10</span></span>

(Heb.: 36:11-13) Now for the first time, in the concluding hexastich,
after complaint and commendation comes the language of prayer. The poet
prays that God would lengthen out, i.e., henceforth preserve (משׁך, as
in [Psa 109:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#012).md), such mercy to His
saints; that the foot of arrogance, which is conceived of as a tyrant,
may not come suddenly upon him (בּוא, as in [Psa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008).md), and that the hand of the wicked
may not drive him from his home into exile (cf. [Psa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018).md). With חסד alternates צדקה,
which, on its merciful side, is turned towards them that now God, and
bestows upon them the promised gracious reward. Whilst the Psalmist is
thus praying, the future all at once becomes unveiled to him. Certain in
his own mind that his prayer will be heard, he sees the adversaries of
God and of His saints for ever overthrown. שׁם, as in [Psa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md), points to the place where the
judgment is executed. The preterites are prophetic, as in [Psa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md); [Psa
64:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008.md). The poet, like Isaiah ([Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014).md), beholds the whole tribe of the
oppressors of Jahve's Church changed into a field of corpses, without
hope of any rising again.
