### [Exodus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 4:1</span></span>

Moses now started a fresh difficulty: the Israelites would not believe
that Jehovah had appeared to him. There was so far a reason for this
difficulty, that from the time of Jacob-an interval, therefore, of 430
years - God had never appeared to any Israelite. God therefore removed
it by giving him three signs by which he might attest his divine mission
to his people. These three signs were intended indeed for the
Israelites, to convince them of the reality of the appearance of Jehovah
to Moses; at the same time, as even Ephraem Syrus observed, they also
served to strengthen Moses' faith, and dissipate his fears as to the
result of his mission. For it was apparent enough that Moses did not
possess true and entire confidence in God, from the fact that he still
raised this difficulty, and distrusted the divine assurance, "They will
hearken to thy voice," [Exo 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018).md). And
finally, these signs were intended for Pharaoh, as is stated in [Exo
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021); and to him the אתות (σημεῖα.md)
were to become מפתים (τέρατα). By these signs Moses was installed as the
servant of Jehovah ([Exo 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031).md), and
furnished with divine power, with which he could and was to appear
before the children of Israel and Pharaoh as the messenger of Jehovah.
The character of the three signs corresponded to this intention.

[Exo 4:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002.md)

The First Sign. - The turning of Moses' staff into a serpent, which
became a staff again when Moses took it by the tail, had reference to
the calling of Moses. The staff in his hand was his shepherd's crook
(מזּה [Exo 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002.md), for מה־זה, in this
place alone), and represented his calling as a shepherd. At the bidding
of God he threw it upon the ground, and the staff became a serpent,
before which Moses fled. The giving up of his shepherd-life would expose
him to dangers, from which he would desire to escape. At the same time,
there was more implied in the figure of a serpent than danger which
merely threatened his life. The serpent had been the constant enemy of
the seed of the woman (Gen 3), and represented the power of the wicked
one which prevailed in Egypt. The explanation in Pirke Elieser, c. 40,
points to this: ideo Deum hoc signum Mosi ostendisse, quia sicut serpens
mordet et morte afficit homines, ita quoque Pharao et Aegyptii mordebant
et necabant Israelitas. But at the bidding of God, Moses seized the
serpent by the tail, and received his staff again as "the rod of God,"
with which he smote Egypt with great plagues. From this sign the people
of Israel would necessarily perceive, that Jehovah had not only called
Moses to be the leader of Israel, but had endowed him with the power to
overcome the serpent-like cunning and the might of Egypt; in other
words, they would "believe that Jehovah, the God of the fathers, had
appeared to him." (On the special meaning of this sign for Pharaoh, see
[Exo 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#010)..md)

[Exo 4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006.md)

The Second Sign. - Moses' hand became leprous, and was afterwards
cleansed again. The expression כּשּׁלג מצרעת, covered with leprosy like
snow, refers to the white leprosy (vid., [Lev
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#003).md). - "Was turned again as his
flesh;" i.e., was restored, became healthy, or clean like the rest of
his body. So far as the meaning of this sign is concerned, Moses' hand
has been explained in a perfectly arbitrary manner as representing the
Israelitish nation, and his bosom as representing first Egypt, and then
Canaan, as the hiding-place of Israel. If the shepherd's staff
represented Moses' calling, the hand was that which directed or ruled
the calling. It is in the bosom that the nurse carried the sucking child
([Num 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012).md), the shepherd the lambs
([Isa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011).md), and the sacred singer
the many nations, from whom he has suffered reproach and injury ([Psa
89:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#050).md). So Moses also carried his
people in his bosom, i.e., in his heart: of that his first appearance in
Egypt was a proof ([Exo 2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#011).md). But
now he was to set his hand to deliver them from the reproach and bondage
of Egypt. He put (הביא) his hand into his bosom, and his hand was
covered with leprosy. The nation was like a leper, who defiled every one
that touched him. The leprosy represented not only "the servitude and
contemptuous treatment of the Israelites in Egypt" (Kurtz), but the
ἀσέβεια of the Egyptians also, as Theodoret expresses it, or rather the
impurity of Egypt in which Israel was sunken. This Moses soon discovered
(cf. [Exo 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#017)..md), and on more than one
occasion afterwards (cf. Num 11); so that he had to complain to Jehovah,
"Wherefore hast Thou afflicted Thy servant, that Thou layest the burden
of all this people upon me?...Have I conceived all this people, that
Thou shouldest say to me, Carry them in thy bosom?" ([Num
11:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#011).md). But God had the power to
purify the nation from this leprosy, and would endow His servant Moses
with that power. At the command of God, Moses put his hand, now covered
with leprosy, once more into his bosom, and drew it out quite cleansed.
This was what Moses was to learn by the sign; whilst Israel also learned
that God both could and would deliver it, through the cleansed hand of
Moses, from all its bodily and spiritual misery. The object of the first
miracle was to exhibit Moses as the man whom Jehovah had called to be
the leader of His people; that of the second, to show that, as the
messenger of Jehovah, he was furnished with the necessary power for the
execution of this calling. In this sense God says, in [Exo
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#008.md), "If they will not hearken to the
voice of the first sign, they will believe the voice of the latter
sign." A voice is ascribed to the sign, as being a clear witness to the
divine mission of the person performing it. ([Psa
105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027).md).

[Exo 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#009.md)

The Third Sign. - If the first two signs should not be sufficient to
lead the people to believe in the divine mission of Moses, he was to
give them one more practical demonstration of the power which he had
received to overcome the might and gods of Egypt. He was to take of the
water of the Nile (the river, [Gen
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001).md) and pour it upon the dry land,
and it would become blood (the second והיוּ is a resumption of the
first, cf. [Exo 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#041).md). The Nile
received divine honours as the source of every good and all prosperity
in the natural life of Egypt, and was even identified with Osiris (cf.
Hengstenberg, Egypt and the Books of Moses, p. 109 transl.). If Moses
therefore had power to turn the life-distributing water of the Nile into
blood, he must also have received power to destroy Pharaoh and his gods.
Israel was to learn this from the sign, whilst Pharaoh and the Egyptians
were afterwards to experience this might of Jehovah in the form of
punishment ([Exo 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#015)..md). Thus Moses as
not only entrusted with the word of God, but also endowed with the power
of God; and as he was the first God-sent prophet, so was he also the
first worker of miracles, and in this capacity a type of the Apostle of
our profession ([Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001).md), even the
God-man, Christ Jesus.

[Exodus 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 4:10</span></span>

Moses raised another difficulty. "I am not a man of words," he said
(i.e., I do not possess the gift of speech), "but am heavy in mouth and
heavy in tongue" (i.e., I find a difficulty in the use of mouth and
tongue, not exactly "stammering"); and that "both of yesterday and the
day before" (i.e., from the very first, [Gen
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#002).md), "and also since Thy speaking to
Thy servant." Moses meant to say, "I neither possess the gift of speech
by nature, nor have I received it since Thou hast spoken to me."

[Exo 4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011.md)

Jehovah both could and would provide for this defect. He had made man's
mouth, and He made dumb or deaf, seeing or blind. He possessed unlimited
power over all the senses, could give them or take them away; and He
would be with Moses' mouth, and teach him what he was to say, i.e.,
impart to him the necessary qualification both as to matter and mode. -
Moses' difficulties were now all exhausted, and removed by the
assurances of God. But this only brought to light the secret reason in
his heart. He did not wish to undertake the divine mission.

[Exo 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#013.md)

"Send, I pray Thee," he says, "by whom Thou wilt send;" i.e., carry out
Thy mission by whomsoever Thou wilt. בּיד שׁלח: to carry out a mission
through any one, originally with accus. rei ([Sa1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#020.md); [Sa2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#014).md), then without the object, as
here, "to send a person" (cf. [Sa2
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#025.md); [Kg1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#025).md). Before תּשׁלח the word אשׁר is
omitted, which stands with בּיד in the construct state (vid., Ges. 123,
3). The anger of God was now excited by this groundless opposition. But
as this unwillingness also arose from weakness of the flesh, the mercy
of God came to the help of his weakness, and He referred Moses to his
brother Aaron, who could speak well, and would address the people for
him ([Exo 4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014).md). Aaron is called
הלּוי, the Levite, from his lineage, possibly with reference to the
primary signification of לוה "to connect one's self" (Baumgarten), but
not with any allusion to the future calling of the tribe of Levi (Rashi
and Calvin). הוּא ידבּר דּבּר speak will he. The inf. abs. gives
emphasis to the verb, and the position of הוּא to the subject. He both
can and will speak, if thou dost not know it.

[Exo 4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014.md)

And Aaron is quite ready to do so. He is already coming to meet thee,
and is glad to see thee. The statement in [Exo
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027.md), where Jehovah directs Aaron to
go and meet Moses, is not at variance with this. They can both be
reconciled in the following simple manner: "As soon as Aaron heard that
his brother had left Midian, he went to meet him of his own accord, and
then God showed him by what road he must go to find him, viz., towards
the desert" (R. Mose ben Nachman). - "Put the words" (sc., which I have
told thee) "into his mouth;" and I will support both thee and him in
speaking. "He will be mouth to thee, and thou shalt be God to him." Cf.
[Exo 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001.md), "Thy brother Aaron shall be
thy prophet." Aaron would stand in the same relation to Moses, as a
prophet to God: the prophet only spoke what God inspired him with, and
Moses should be the inspiring God to him. The Targum softens down the
word "God" into "master, teacher." Moses was called God, as being the
possessor and medium of the divine word. As Luther explains it, "Whoever
possesses and believes the word of God, possesses the Spirit and power
of God, and also the divine wisdom, truth, heart, mind, and everything
that belongs to God." In [Exo 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#017.md),
the plural "signs" points to the penal wonders that followed; for only
one of the three signs given to Moses was performed with the rod.

[Exo 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#018.md)

In consequence of this appearance of God, Moses took leave of his
father-in-law to return to his brethren in Egypt, though without telling
him the real object of his journey, no doubt because Jethro had not the
mind to understand such a divine revelation, though he subsequently
recognised the miracles that God wrought for Israel (Exo 18). By the
"brethren" we are to understand not merely the nearer relatives of
Moses, or the family of Amram, but the Israelites generally. Considering
the oppression under which they were suffering at the time of Moses'
flight, the question might naturally arise, whether they were still
living, and had not been altogether exterminated.

[Exodus 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 4:19</span></span>

Return of Moses to Egypt. - [Exo
4:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#019.md). On leaving Midian, Moses
received another communication from God with reference to his mission to
Pharaoh. The word of Jehovah, in [Exo
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#019.md), is not to be regarded as a
summary of the previous revelation, in which case ויּאמר would be a
pluperfect, nor as the account of another writer, who placed the summons
to return to Egypt not in Sinai but in Midian. It is not a fact that the
departure of Moses is given in [Exo
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#018.md); all that is stated there is,
that Jethro consented to Moses' decision to return to Egypt. It was not
till after this consent that Moses was able to prepare for the journey.
During these preparations God appeared to him in Midian, and encouraged
him to return, by informing him that all the men who had sought his
life, i.e., Pharaoh and the relatives of the Egyptian whom he had slain,
were now dead.

[Exo 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020.md)

Moses then set out upon his journey, with his wife and sons. בּניו is
not to be altered into בּנו, as Knobel supposes, notwithstanding the
fact that the birth of only one son has hitherto been mentioned ([Exo
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#022).md); for neither there, nor in this
passage ([Exo 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#025).md), is he described
as the only son. The wife and sons, who were still young, he placed upon
the ass (the one taken for the purpose), whilst he himself went on foot
with "the staff of God" - as the staff was called with which he was to
perform the divine miracles ([Exo
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#017).md) - in his hand. Poor as his
outward appearance might be, he had in his hand the staff before which
the pride of Pharaoh and all his might would have to bow.

[Exo 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md)

"In thy going (returning) to Egypt, behold, all the wonders which I have
put into thy hand, thou doest them before Pharaoh." מופת, τὸ τέρας,
portentum, is any object (natural event, thing, or person) of
significance which surpasses expectation or the ordinary course of
nature, and excites wonder in consequence. It is frequently connected
with אות, σημεῖον, a sign ([Deu 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md);
[Deu 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#022.md); [Deu
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#019), etc..md), and embraces the idea of
אות within itself, i.e., wonder-sign. The expression, "all those
wonders," does not refer merely to the three signs mentioned in [Exo
4:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002.md), but to all the miracles which
were to be performed by Moses with the staff in the presence of Pharaoh,
and which, though not named, were put into his hand potentially along
with the staff. - But all the miracles would not induce Pharaoh to let
Israel go, for Jehovah would harden his heart. את־לבּו אחזּק אני, lit.,
I will make his heart firm, so that it will not move, his feelings and
attitude towards Israel will not change. For אחזּק אני or וחזּקתּי ([Exo
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#004).md) and מחזּק אני ([Exo
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#017).md), we find אקשׁה אני in [Exo
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003.md), "I will make Pharaoh's heart
hard, or unfeeling;" and in [Exo 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#001.md),
הכבּדתּי אני "I have made his heart heavy," i.e., obtuse, or insensible
to impressions or divine influences. These three words are expressive of
the hardening of the heart.

The hardening of Pharaoh is ascribed to God, not only in the passages
just quoted, but also in [Exo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#012.md);
[Exo 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#020.md), [Exo
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#027.md); [Exo
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#010.md); [Exo
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#008.md); that is to say, ten times in
all; and that not merely as foreknown or foretold by Jehovah, but as
caused and effected by Him. In the last five passages it is invariably
stated that "Jehovah hardened (יהזּק) Pharaoh's heart." But it is also
stated just as often, viz., ten times, that Pharaoh hardened his own
heart, or made it heavy or firm; e.g., in [Exo
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#013.md), [Exo
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022.md); [Exo
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#015.md); [Exo
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#035.md), לב ויּחזק "and Pharaoh's heart
was (or became) hard;" [Exo 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#014.md), לב
כּבד "Pharaoh's heart was heavy;" in [Exo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#007.md), ל יכבּד; in [Exo
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#011.md), [Exo
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#028.md); [Exo
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#034.md), את־לבּו ויּכבּד or והכבּד; in
[Exo 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#015.md), פ הקשׁה כּי "for Pharaoh
made his heart hard." According to this, the hardening of Pharaoh was
quite as much his own act as the decree of God. But if, in order to
determine the precise relation of the divine to the human causality, we
look more carefully at the two classes of expressions, we shall find
that not only in connection with the first sign, by which Moses and
Aaron were to show their credentials as the messengers of Jehovah, sent
with the demand that he would let the people of Israel go ([Exo
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#013).md), but after the first five
penal miracles, the hardening is invariably represented as his own.
After every one of these miracles, it is stated that Pharaoh's heart was
firm, or dull, i.e., insensible to the voice of God, and unaffected by
the miracles performed before his eyes, and the judgments of God
suspended over him and his kingdom, and he did not listen to them (to
Moses and Aaron with their demand), or let the people go ([Exo
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022.md); [Exo
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#008.md), [Exo
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#015.md), [Exo
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#028.md); [Exo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#007).md). It is not till after the sixth
plague that it is stated that Jehovah made the heart of Pharaoh firm
([Exo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#012).md). At the seventh the
statement is repeated, that "Pharaoh made his heart heavy" ([Exo
9:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#034).md); but the continued refusal on
the part of Pharaoh after the eighth and ninth ([Exo
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#020.md), [Exo
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#027).md) and his resolution to follow
the Israelites and bring them back again, are attributed to the
hardening of his heart by Jehovah ([Exo
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#008.md), cf. [Exo
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#004.md) and [Exo
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#017).md). This hardening of his own
heart was manifested first of all in the fact, that he paid not
attention to the demand of Jehovah addressed to him through Moses, and
would not let Israel go; and that not only at the commencement, so long
as the Egyptian magicians imitated the signs performed by Moses and
Aaron (though at the very first sign the rods of the magicians, when
turned into serpents, were swallowed by Aaron's, [Exo
7:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#012).md), but even when the magicians
themselves acknowledged, "This is the finger of God" ([Exo
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019).md). It was also continued after the
fourth and fifth plagues, when a distinction was made between the
Egyptians and the Israelites, and the latter were exempted from the
plagues, - a fact of which the king took care to convince himself ([Exo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#007).md). And it was exhibited still
further in his breaking his promise, that he would let Israel go if
Moses and Aaron would obtain from Jehovah the removal of the plague, and
in the fact, that even after he had been obliged to confess, "I have
sinned, Jehovah is the righteous one, I and my people are unrighteous"
([Exo 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027).md), he sinned again, as soon
as breathing-time was given him, and would not let the people go ([Exo
9:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#034).md). Thus Pharaoh would not bend
his self-will to the will of God, even after he had discerned the finger
of God and the omnipotence of Jehovah in the plagues suspended over him
and his nation; he would not withdraw his haughty refusal,
notwithstanding the fact that he was obliged to acknowledge that it was
sin against Jehovah. Looked at from this side, the hardening was a fruit
of sin, a consequence of that self-will, high-mindedness, and pride
which flow from sin, and a continuous and ever increasing abuse of that
freedom of the will which is innate in man, and which involves the
possibility of obstinate resistance to the word and chastisement of God
even until death. As the freedom of the will has its fixed limits in the
unconditional dependence of the creature upon the Creator, so the sinner
may resist the will of God as long as he lives. But such resistance
plunges him into destruction, and is followed inevitably by death and
damnation. God never allows any man to scoff at Him. Whoever will not
suffer himself to be led, by the kindness and earnestness of the divine
admonitions, to repentance and humble submission to the will of God,
must inevitably perish, and by his destruction subserve the glory of
God, and the manifestation of the holiness, righteousness, and
omnipotence of Jehovah.

But God not only permits a man to harden himself; He also produces
obduracy, and suspends this sentence over the impenitent. Not as though
God took pleasure in the death of the wicked! No; God desires that the
wicked should repent of his evil way and live ([Eze
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#011).md); and He desires this most
earnestly, for "He will have all men to be saved and to come unto the
knowledge of the truth" ([Ti1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md), cf.
[Pe2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009).md). As God causes His earthly
sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and
the unjust ([Mat 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045).md), so He causes
His sun of grace to shine upon all sinners, to lead them to life and
salvation. But as the earthly sun produces different effects upon the
earth, according to the nature of the soil upon which it shines, so the
influence of the divine sun of grace manifests itself in different ways
upon the human heart, according to its moral condition.

(Note: "The sun, by the force of its heat, moistens the wax and dries
the clay, softening the one and hardening the other; and as this
produces opposite effects by the same power, so, through the
long-suffering of God, which reaches to all, some receive good and
others evil, some are softened and others hardened." - (Theodoret,
quaest. 12 in Ex.))

The penitent permit the proofs of divine goodness and grace to lead them
to repentance and salvation; but the impenitent harden themselves more
and more against the grace of God, and so become ripe for the judgment
of damnation. The very same manifestation of the mercy of God leads in
the case of the one to salvation and life, and in that of the other to
judgment and death, because he hardens himself against that mercy. In
this increasing hardness on the part of the impenitent sinner against
the mercy that is manifested towards him, there is accomplished the
judgment of reprobation, first in God's furnishing the wicked with an
opportunity of bringing fully to light the evil inclinations, desires,
and thoughts that are in their hearts; and then, according to an
invariable law of the moral government of the world, in His rendering
the return of the impenitent sinner more and more difficult on account
of his continued resistance, and eventually rendering it altogether
impossible. It is the curse of sin, that it renders the hard heart
harder, and less susceptible to the gracious manifestations of divine
love, long-suffering, and patience. In this twofold manner God produces
hardness, not only permissive but effective; i.e., not only by giving
time and space for the manifestation of human opposition, even to the
utmost limits of creaturely freedom, but still more by those continued
manifestations of His will which drive the hard heart to such utter
obduracy that it is no longer capable of returning, and so giving over
the hardened sinner to the judgment of damnation. This is what we find
in the case of Pharaoh. After he had hardened his heart against the
revealed will of God during the first five plagues, the hardening
commenced on the part of Jehovah with the sixth miracle ([Exo
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#012).md), when the omnipotence of God was
displayed with such energy that even the Egyptian magicians were covered
with the boils, and could no longer stand before Moses ([Exo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#011).md). And yet, even after this
hardening on the part of God, another opportunity was given to the
wicked king to repent and change his mind, so that on two other
occasions he acknowledged that his resistance was sin, and promised to
submit to the will of Jehovah ([Exo
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027.md)., [Exo
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#016)..md). But when at length, even
after the seventh plague, he broke his promise to let Israel go, and
hardened his heart again as soon as the plague was removed ([Exo
9:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#034).md), Jehovah so hardened
Pharaoh's heart that he not only did not let Israel go, but threatened
Moses with death if he ever came into his presence again ([Exo
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#020.md), [Exo
10:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#027).md). The hardening was now
completed so that he necessarily fell a victim to judgment; though the
very first stroke of judgment in the slaying of the first-born was an
admonition to consider and return. And it was not till after he had
rejected the mercy displayed in this judgment, and manifested a defiant
spirit once more, in spite of the words with which he had given Moses
and Aaron permission to depart, "Go, and bless me also" ([Exo
12:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#031).md), that God completely
hardened his heart, so that he pursued the Israelites with an army, and
was overtaken by the judgment of utter destruction.

Now, although the hardening of Pharaoh on the part of Jehovah was only
the complement of Pharaoh's hardening of his own heart, in the verse
before us the former aspect alone is presented, because the principal
object was not only to prepare Moses for the opposition which he would
meet with from Pharaoh, but also to strengthen his weak faith, and
remove at the very outset every cause for questioning and omnipotence of
Jehovah. If it was by Jehovah Himself that Pharaoh was hardened, this
hardening, which He not only foresaw and predicted by virtue of His
omniscience, but produced and inflicted through His omnipotence, could
not possibly hinder the performance of His will concerning Israel, but
must rather contribute to the realization of His purposes of salvation
and the manifestation of His glory (cf. [Exo
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016.md); [Exo
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#002.md); [Exo
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#004.md), [Exo
14:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#017).md).

[Exo 4:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md)

In order that Pharaoh might form a true estimate of the solemnity of the
divine command, Moses was to make known to him not only the relation of
Jehovah to Israel, but also the judgment to which he would be exposed if
he refused to let Israel go. The relation in which Israel stood to
Jehovah was expressed by God in the words, "Israel is My first-born
son." Israel was Jehovah's son by virtue of his election to be the
people of possession ([Deu 14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001).md).
This election began with the call of Abraham to be the father of the
nation in which all the families of the earth were to be blessed. On the
ground of this promise, which was now to be realized in the seed of
Abraham by the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, the nation of Israel
is already called Jehovah's "son," although it was through the
conclusion of the covenant at Sinai that it was first exalted to be the
people of Jehovah's possession out of all the nations ([Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005).md). The divine sonship of Israel
was therefore spiritual in its nature: it neither sprang from the fact
that God, as the Creator of all nations, was also the Creator, or
Begetter, and Father of Israel, nor was it founded, as Baumgarten
supposes, upon "the physical generation of Isaac, as having its origin,
not in the power of nature, but in the power of grace." The relation of
God, as Creator, to man His creature, is never referred to in the Old
Testament as that of a father to a son; to say nothing of the fact that
the Creator of man is Elohim, and not Jehovah. Wherever Jehovah is
called the Father, Begetter, or Creator of Israel (even in [Deu
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018.md); [Jer
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027.md); [Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008.md); [Mal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006.md) and [Mal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010).md), the fatherhood of God relates
to the election of Israel as Jehovah's people of possession. But the
election upon which the υἱοθεσία of Israel was founded, is not presented
in the aspect of a "begetting through the Spirit;" it is spoken of
rather as acquiring or buying (קנה), making (עשׂה), founding or
establishing (כּנן, [Deu 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006).md). Even
the expressions, "the Rock that begat thee," "God that bare thee" ([Deu
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018).md), do not point to the idea of
spiritual generation, but are to be understood as referring to the
creation; just as in [Psa 90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002.md), where
Moses speaks of the mountains as "brought forth" and the earth as
"born." The choosing of Israel as the son of God was an adoption flowing
from the free grace of God which involved the loving, fatherly treatment
of the son, and demanded obedience, reverence, and confidence towards
the Father ([Mal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006).md). It was this
which constituted the very essence of the covenant made by Jehovah with
Israel, that He treated it with mercy and love ([Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md); [Jer
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009.md), [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020).md), pitied it as a father pitieth
his children ([Psa 103:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013).md), chastened
it on account of its sins, yet did not withdraw His mercy from it ([Sa2
7:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md); [Psa
89:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#031).md), and trained His son to be a
holy nation by the love and severity of paternal discipline. - Still
Israel was not only a son, but the "first-born son" of Jehovah. In this
title the calling of the heathen is implied. Israel was not to be
Jehovah's only son, but simply the first-born, who was peculiarly dear
to his Father, and had certain privileges above the rest. Jehovah was
about to exalt Israel above all the nations of the earth ([Deu
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001).md). Now, if Pharaoh would not let
Jehovah's first-born son depart, he would pay the penalty in the life of
his own first-born (cf. [Exo 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029).md).
In this intense earnestness of the divine command, Moses had a strong
support to his faith. If Israel was Jehovah's first-born son, Jehovah
could not relinquish him, but must deliver His son from the bondage of
Egypt.

[Exo 4:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024.md)

But if Moses was to carry out the divine commission with success, he
must first of all prove himself to be a faithful servant of Jehovah in
his own house. This he was to learn from the occurrence at the inn: an
occurrence which has many obscurities on account of the brevity of the
narrative, and has received many different interpretations. When Moses
was on the way, Jehovah met him at the resting-place (מלון, see [Gen
42:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#027).md), and sought to kill him. In
what manner, is not stated: whether by a sudden seizure with some fatal
disease, or, what is more probable, by some act proceeding directly from
Himself, which threatened Moses with death. This hostile attitude on the
part of God was occasioned by his neglect to circumcise his son; for, as
soon as Zipporah cut off (circumcised) the foreskin of her son with a
stone, Jehovah let him go. צור = צוּר, a rock, or stone, here a stone
knife, with which, according to hereditary custom, the circumcision
commanded by Joshua was also performed; not, however, because "stone
knives were regarded as less dangerous than those of metal," nor because
"for symbolical reasons preference was given to them, as a simple
production of nature, over the metal knives that had been prepared by
human hands and were applied to daily use." For if the Jews had detected
any religious or symbolical meaning in stone, they would never have
given it up for iron or steel, but would have retained it, like the
Ethiopian tribe of the Alnaii, who used stone knives for that purpose as
late as 150 years ago; whereas, in the Talmud, the use of iron or steel
knives for the purpose of circumcision is spoken of, as though they were
universally employed. Stone knives belong to a time anterior to the
manufacture of iron or steel; and wherever they were employed at a later
period, this arose from a devoted adherence to the older and simpler
custom (see my Commentary on [Jos
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#002).md). From the word "her son," it is
evident that Zipporah only circumcised one of the two sons of Moses
([Exo 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020).md); so that the other, not
doubt the elder, had already been circumcised in accordance with the
law. Circumcision had been enjoined upon Abraham by Jehovah as a
covenant sign for all his descendants; and the sentence of death was
pronounced upon any neglect of it, as being a breach of the covenant
([Gen 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#014).md). Although in this passage
it is the uncircumcised themselves who are threatened with death, yet in
the case of children the punishment fell upon the parents, and first of
all upon the father, who had neglected to keep the commandment of God.
Now, though Moses had probably omitted circumcision simply from regard
to his Midianitish wife, who disliked this operation, he had been guilty
of a capital crime, which God could not pass over in the case of one
whom He had chosen to be His messenger, to establish His covenant with
Israel. Hence He threatened him with death, to bring him to a
consciousness of his sin, either by the voice of conscience or by some
word which accompanied His attack upon Moses; and also to show him with
what earnestness God demanded the keeping of His commandments. Still He
did not kill him; for his sin had sprung from weakness of the flesh,
from a sinful yielding to his wife, which could both be explained and
excused on account of his position in the Midianite's house. That
Zipporah's dislike to circumcision had been the cause of the omission,
has been justly inferred by commentators from the fact, that on
Jehovah's attack upon Moses, she proceeded at once to perform what had
been neglected, and, as it seems, with inward repugnance. The
expression, "She threw (the foreskin of her son) at his (Moses') feet,"
points to this (ל הגּיע, as in [Isa
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#012)). The suffix in רגליו (his feet.md)
cannot refer to the son, not only because such an allusion would give no
reasonable sense, but also because the suffix refers to Moses in the
immediate context, both before (in המיתו, [Exo
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024).md) and after (in ממּנּוּ, [Exo
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#026).md); and therefore it is simpler to
refer it to Moses here. From this it follows, then, that the words, "a
blood-bridegroom art thou to me," were addressed to Moses, and not to
the boy. Zipporah calls Moses a blood-bridegroom, "because she had been
compelled, as it were, to acquire and purchase him anew as a husband by
shedding the blood of her son" (Glass). "Moses had been as good as taken
from her by the deadly attack which had been made upon him. She
purchased his life by the blood of her son; she received him back, as it
were, from the dead, and married him anew; he was, in fact, a bridegroom
of blood to her" (Kurtz). This she said, as the historian adds, after
God had let Moses, go, למּוּלות, "with reference to the circumcisions."
The plural is used quite generally and indefinitely, as Zipporah
referred not merely to this one instance, but to circumcision generally.
Moses was apparently induced by what had occurred to decide not to take
his wife and children with him to Egypt, but to send them back to his
father-in-law. We may infer this from the fact, that it was not till
after Israel had arrived at Sinai that he brought them to him again
([Exo 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#002).md).

[Exo 4:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027.md)

After the removal of the sin, which had excited the threatening wrath of
Jehovah, Moses once more received a token of the divine favour in the
arrival of Aaron, under the direction of God, to meet him at the Mount
of God ([Exo 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001).md). To Aaron he related
all the words of Jehovah, with which He had sent (commissioned) him
(שׁלח with a double accusative, as in [Sa2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#022.md); [Jer
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#005).md), and all the signs which He had
commanded him (צוּה also with a double accusative, as in [Gen
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#022).md). Another proof of the favour of
God consisted of the believing reception of his mission on the part of
the elders and the people of Israel. "The people believed" (ויּאמן) when
Aaron communicated to them the words of Jehovah to Moses, and did the
signs in their presence. "And when they heard that Jehovah had visited
the children of Israel, and had looked upon their affliction, they bowed
and worshipped." (Knobel is wrong in proposing to alter ישׁמעוּ into
ישׂמחוּ, according to the Sept. rendering, καὶ ἐχάρη). The faith of the
people, and the worship by which their faith was expressed, proved that
the promise of the fathers still lived in their hearts. And although
this faith did not stand the subsequent test (Exo 5), yet, as the first
expression of their feelings, it bore witness to the fact that Israel
was willing to follow the call of God.
