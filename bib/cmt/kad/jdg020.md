### [Judges Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md)

[Judges 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 20:1</span></span>

War with Benjamin on the Part of All the Other Tribes. - The expectation
of the Levite was fulfilled. The congregation of Israel assembled at
Mizpeh to pass sentence upon Gibeah, and formed the resolution that they
would not rest till the crime was punished as it deserved ([Jdg
20:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001).md). But when the Benjaminites
refused to deliver up the offenders in Gibeah, and prepared to offer
resistance, the other tribes began to make war upon Gibeah and Benjamin
([Jdg 20:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#011).md), but were twice
defeated by the Benjaminites with very great loss ([Jdg
20:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#020).md). At length, however, they
succeeded by an act of stratagem in taking Gibeah and burning it to the
ground, and completely routing the Benjaminites, and also in putting to
death all the men and cattle that they found in the other towns of this
tribe, and laying the towns in ashes, whereby the whole of the tribe of
Benjamin was annihilated, with the exception of a very small remnant
(vv. 29-48).

[Jdg 20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md)

Decree of the Congregation concerning Gibeah. - [Jdg
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md), [Jdg
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#002.md). All the Israelites went out
(rose up from their dwelling-places) to assemble together as a
congregation like one man; all the tribes from Dan, the northern
boundary of the land (i.e., Dan-laish, [Jdg
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#029).md), to Beersheba, the most
southerly town of Canaan (see at [Gen
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031).md), and the land of Gilead, i.e.,
the inhabitants of the land to the east of the Jordan, "to Jehovah at
Mizpeh" in Benjamin, i.e., the present Nebi-samwil, in the neighbourhood
of Kirjath-jearim, on the western border of the tribe of Benjamin (see
at [Jos 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026).md). It by no means follows
with certainty from the expression "to Jehovah," that there was a
sanctuary at Mizpeh, or that the ark of the covenant was taken thither,
but simply that the meeting took place in the sight of Jehovah, or that
the congregation assembled together to hold a judicial court, which they
held in the name of Jehovah, analogous to the expression el-Elohim in
[Exo 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md); [Exo
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#007.md). It was not essential to a
judicial proceeding that the ark should be present. At this assembly the
pinnoth (the corner-pillars) of the whole nation presented themselves,
i.e., the heads and fathers as the supports of the congregation or of
the sate organism (vid., [Sa1 14:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#038.md);
[Isa 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013).md), even of all the tribes of
Israel four hundred thousand men on foot, drawing the sword, i.e., armed
foot soldiers ready for battle.

[Jdg 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#003.md)

"The Benjaminites heard that the children of Israel (the rest of the
Israelites, the eleven tribes) had come up to Mizpeh;" but they
themselves were not found there. This follows from the fact that nothing
is said about the Benjaminites coming, and still more clearly from [Jdg
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#013.md), where it is stated that the
assembled tribes sent men to the Benjaminites, after holding their
deliberations and forming their resolutions, to call them to account for
the crime that had been committed in the midst of them. Consequently the
question with which the whole affair was opened, "Say, how did this
wicked deed take place?" is not to be regarded as addressed to the two
parties, the inhabitants of Gibeah of the Benjaminites and the Levite
(Bertheau), but as a summons to all who were assembled to relate what
any one knew respecting the occurrence.

[Jdg 20:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#004.md)

Then the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, described the whole
affair. הגּבעה בּעלי, the owners or citizens of Gibeah (see at [Jdg
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#002).md). "Me they intended to kill:" the
Levite draws this conclusion from what had happened to his wife; the men
of Gibeah had not expressed any such intention in [Jdg
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022). "All the country (lit. field.md)
of the inheritance of Israel," i.e., all the land of the Israelites.
זמּה is applied to the vice of lewdness, as in [Lev
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017.md), which was to be punished with
death. וגו לכם הבוּ, "give yourselves (לכם as dat. comm.) word and
counsel here," i.e., make up your minds and pass sentence (vid., [Sa2
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#020).md). הלם, here, where you are all
assembled together.

[Jdg 20:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#008.md)

Then all the people rose up as one man, saying, "We will not any of us
go into his tent, neither will we any of us return to his house," sc.,
till this crime is punished. The sentence follows in [Jdg
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#009.md) : "This is the thing that we will
do," i.e., this is the way in which we will treat Gibeah: "against it by
lot" (sc., we will act). The Syriac gives the sense correctly - We will
cast lots upon it; but the lxx quite erroneously supply ἀναβησόμεθα (we
will go up); and in accordance with this, many expositors connect the
words with [Jdg 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#010.md) in the following
sense: "We will choose one man out of every ten by lot, to supply the
army with the necessary provision during the expedition." This is quite
a mistake, because in this way a subordinate point, which only comes
into consideration in connection with the execution of the sentence,
would be made the chief point, and the sentence itself would not be
given at all. The words "against it by lot" contain the resolution that
was formed concerning the sinful town, and have all the enigmatical
brevity of judicial sentences, and are to be explained from the course
laid down in the Mosaic law with regard to the Canaanites, who were to
be exterminated, and their land divided by lot among the Israelites.
Consequently the meaning is simply this: "Let us proceed with the lot
against Gibeah," i.e., let us deal with it as with the towns of the
Canaanites, conquer it, lay it in ashes, and distribute its territory by
lot. In [Jdg 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#010.md) a subordinate
circumstance is mentioned, which was necessary to enable them to carry
out the resolution that had been made. As the assembled congregation had
determined to keep together for the purpose of carrying on war ([Jdg
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#008).md), it was absolutely necessary
that resources should be provided for those who were actively engaged in
the war. For this purpose they chose one man in every ten "to fetch
provision for the people," לבואם לעשׁות, "that they might do on their
coming to Gibeah of Benjamin according to all the folly which had been
done in Israel," i.e., might punish the wickedness in Gibeah as it
deserved.

[Jdg 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#011.md)

Thus the men of Israel assembled together against Gibeah, united as one
man. חברים, lit. as comrades, simply serves to strengthen the expression
"as one man." With this remark, which indicates briefly the carrying out
of the resolution that was adopted, the account of the meeting of the
congregation is brought to a close; but the actual progress of the
affair is really anticipated, inasmuch as what is related in [Jdg
20:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#012.md) preceded the expedition in
order of time.

[Judges 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 20:12</span></span>

Before the tribes of Israel entered upon the war, they sent men to all
the tribes of Benjamin, who were to demand that the culprits in Gibeah
should be given up to be punished, that the evil might thus be
exterminated from Israel, according to the law in [Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022.md) as compared with [Jdg
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006.md) and [Jdg
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#012.md). "The tribes of Benjamin" are
the same as "the families of Benjamin:" the historian pictured to
himself the different divisions of the tribe of Benjamin as warlike
powers about to carry on a war with the other tribes of Israel. The word
shebet (tribe) is used in a different way in [Num
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#018.md). But the Benjaminites would not
hearken to the voice of their brethren, the other tribes of Israel. The
Keri (sons of Benjamin) is a needless alteration, since Benjamin may be
construed with the plural as a collective term. By refusing this just
demand on the part of the other tribes, the Benjaminites took the side
of the culprits in Gibeah, and compelled the congregation to make war
upon the whole tribe.

[Judges 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 20:14</span></span>

Both sides now made their preparations. The Benjaminites assembled
together at Gibeah out of their different towns, and "were mustered
26,000 men drawing the sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah they were
mustered, 700 picked men" (הגפּקדוּ, with the reduplication dropped,
like the Hothpael in [Num 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#047).md). "Out
of all this people there were 700 picked men, lamed in the right hand,
all these (were) slinging with a stone (hitting) at a hair's breadth
without fail." These statement are not quite clear. Since, according to
the distinct words of [Jdg 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016.md), the
700 slingers with their left hands were "out of the whole people," i.e.,
out of the whole number of fighting men mentioned in [Jdg
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016.md), they cannot be the same as the
700 chosen men referred to in [Jdg
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015.md), notwithstanding the similarity
in the numbers and the expression "chosen men." The obscurity arises
chiefly from the word התפּקדוּ in [Jdg
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015.md), which is separated by the
Masoretic accents from שׁבע מ, and connected with the previous words:
"Beside the inhabitants of Gibeah they (the men of the towns of
Benjamin) were mustered." On the other hand, the earlier translators
took the clause as a relative one: "Beside the inhabitants of Gibeah,
who were mustered 700 men." And this seems absolutely necessary, because
otherwise the following words, "700 picked men," would stand without any
connection; whilst we should certainly expect at least to find the cop.
vav, if these 700 men were not inhabitants of Gibeah. But even if
התפּקדוּ should be taken as a simple repetition of ויּתפּקדוּ, the
statement which follows could not be understood in any other way than as
referring to the number of the fighting men of Gibeah. There is
something striking too in the fact that only Benjaminites "out of the
cities" are mentioned, and that emphasis is laid upon this by the
repetition of the expression "out of the cities" ([Jdg
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#014.md), [Jdg
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015).md). Some have inferred from this,
that the Benjaminites as the rulers had settled in the towns, whilst the
Canaanites who had been subdued settled as dependants in the villages
(Bertheau); or that the Benjaminites had formed military brotherhoods,
the members of which lived unmarried in the towns, and that this may
possibly account for the abominable crime to which the inhabitants of
Gibeah were addicted, and in relation to which the whole tribe took
their part (O. v. Gerlach). But such inferences as these are extremely
uncertain, as the cities may be mentioned a potiori for all the places
inhabited by this tribe. There is another difficulty in the numbers.
According to [Jdg 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#014.md), [Jdg
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015.md), the total number of the
fighting men of Benjamin amounted to 26,000 and 700, without reckoning
Gibeah. But, according to the account of the battle, 25,100 were slain
([Jdg 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035).md), viz., 18,000 in the
principal engagement, 5000 as a gleaning, and 200 in the pursuit, i.e.,
25,000 men in all ([Jdg 20:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#044).md), and
only 600 were left, who fled into the desert to the rock Rimmon ([Jdg
20:47](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#047).md). According to these accounts,
the whole tribe would have contained only 25,100 + 600 = 25,700 fighting
men, or 25,000 + 600 = 25,600. Accordingly, in [Jdg
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015), the lxx (Cod. Al. etc..md) and
Vulgate give only 25,000 men; whilst the rest of the ancient versions
have 26,000, in agreement with the Masoretic text. Josephus (Ant. v. 2,
10) also gives the number of fighting men in Benjamin as 25,600, of whom
600 were splendid slingers; but he has merely taken the numbers from
[Jdg 20:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#044.md). Now, although mistakes
do frequently occur in the numbers given, it is a most improbable
supposition that we have a mistake of this kind (26,000 for 25,000) in
the instance before us, since even the latter number would not agree
with [Jdg 20:44](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#044.md).; and the assumption,
that in [Jdg 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035.md) and [Jdg
20:44](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#044.md). we have an account of all the
Benjaminites who fell, finds no support whatever in the history itself.
In the verses referred to we have simply a statement of the number of
Benjaminites who fell in the defeat which they sustained on the third
day, whereas the victories which they gained on the first and second
days could hardly have been obtained without some loss on their part; on
the contrary, we may confidently assume that they would not lose less
than a thousand men, though these are not mentioned in the brief account
before us. The other difference between [Jdg
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035.md) and [Jdg
20:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#044.md), viz., that 25,100 are given
in the one and 25,000 in the other, may be explained on the simple
assumption that we have only the full thousands mentioned in the latter,
whilst the exact number is given in the former. "Left-handed:" see at
[Jdg 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md).

[Judges 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 20:17</span></span>

The forces of the other tribes amounted when numbered to 400,000 men.
These numbers (26,000 Benjaminites and 400,000 Israelites) will not
appear too great if we consider that the whole of the congregation of
Israel took part in the war, with the simple exception of Jabesh in
Gilead ([Jdg 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#008).md), and that in the
time of Moses the twelve tribes numbered more than 600,000 men of twenty
years old and upwards (Num 26), so that not much more than two-thirds of
the whole of the fighting men went out to the war.

[Jdg 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018.md)

Before opening the campaign the Israelites went to Bethel, to inquire of
God which tribe should commence the war, i.e., should fight at the head
of the other tribes (on the fact itself, see [Jdg
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001).md); and God appointed the tribe of
Judah, as in [Jdg 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002.md). They went to
Bethel,

(Note: Rendered "the house of God" in the English version. - Tr.)

not to Shiloh, where the tabernacle was standing, because that place was
too far from the seat of war. The ark of the covenant was therefore
brought to Bethel, and Phinehas the high priest inquired of the Lord
before it through the Urim and Thummim ([Jdg
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#027.md), [Jdg
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028).md). Bethel was on the northern
boundary of the tribe of Benjamin, and was consecrated to this purpose
before any other place by the revelations of God which had been made to
the patriarch Jacob there (Gen 28 and 35).

[Judges 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 20:19</span></span>

Thus equipped, the Israelites proceeded against Gibeah.

[Judges 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 20:20</span></span>

As soon as the Israelites had posted themselves at Gibeah in battle
array (מלחמה ערך, to put in a row, or arrange the war or conflict, i.e.,
to put themselves in battle array, [Sa1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#002.md); [Sa1
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#002), etc..md), the Benjaminites came out
and destroyed 22,000 men of Israel upon that day. ארצה השׁחית, to
destroy to the earth, i.e., to lay dead upon the ground.

[Judges 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 20:22</span></span>

Notwithstanding this terrible overthrow, the people strengthened
themselves, and prepared again for battle, "at the same place" where
they had made ready on the first day, "seeking out of pure vainglory to
wipe out the stains and the disgrace which their previous defeat had
brought upon them" (Berleb. Bible).

[Judges 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 20:23</span></span>

But before renewing the conflict they went up to Bethel, wept there
before Jehovah, i.e., before the sanctuary of the ark, where Jehovah was
present in the midst of His people, enthroned between the cherubim,
until the evening, and then inquired of the Lord (again through the high
priest) "Shall I again draw near to war with the children of Benjamin my
brother" (i.e., renew the war with him)? The answer ran thus: "Advance
against him."

[Judges 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 20:24</span></span>

But on the second day also the Benjaminites brought 18,000 of them to
the ground. "The second day" is not the day following the first
engagement, as if the battles had been fought upon two successive days,
but the second day of actual fighting, which took place some days after
the first, for the inquiry was made at Bethel as to the will of God
between the two engagements.

[Judges 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 20:26</span></span>

After this second terrible overthrow, "the children of Israel" (k.e.
those who were engaged in the war), and "all the people," i.e., the rest
of the people, those members of the congregation who were not capable of
bearing arms, old men and women, came to Bethel, to complain to the Lord
of their misfortune, and secure His favour by fasting and sacrifices.
The congregation now discovered, from this repeated defeat, that the
Lord had withdrawn His grace, and was punishing them. Their sin,
however, did not consist in the fact that they had begun the war
itself-for the law in [Deu 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022.md), to
which they themselves had referred in [Jdg
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#013.md), really required this - but
rather in the state of mind with which they had entered upon the war,
their strong self-consciousness, and great confidence in their own might
and power. They had indeed inquired of God (Elohim) who should open the
conflict; but they had neglect to humble themselves before Jehovah the
covenant God, in the consciousness not only of their own weakness and
sinfulness, but also of grief at the moral corruption of their
brother-tribe. It is certainly not without significance, that in [Jdg
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018.md) it is stated that "they asked
God" (בּאלהים ישׁאלוּ), i.e., they simply desired a supreme or divine
decision as to the question who should lead the van in the war; whereas,
after the first defeat, they wept before Jehovah, and inquired of
Jehovah ([Jdg 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#023).md), the covenant
God, for whose law and right they were about to contend. But even then
there were still wanting the humility and penitence, without which the
congregation of the Lord could not successfully carry on the conflict
against the ungodly. The remark in [Jdg
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#022), "The people felt (showed.md)
themselves strong, and added (continued) to set in array the war," is
thoroughly expressive of the feeling of the congregation. They resolved
upon the continuance of the war, in the full consciousness of their
superior power and numerical strength; and it was not till afterwards
that they complained to the Lord of their misfortune, and inquired
whether they should renew the conflict. The question was followed by a
corresponding answer on the part of God, "Go up against him," which
certainly sanctioned the continuance of the war, but gave no promise as
to the result, because the people, thinking that they might be certain
of success, had not inquired about that at all. It was not till after
the second severe defeat, when 22,000 and 18,000, the tenth part of the
whole army, had fallen, that they humbled themselves before the Lord.
They not only wept because of the calamity which had befallen them, but
fasted the same day before the Lord, - the fasting being the manifest
expression of the bending of the heart before God, - and offered
burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. The shelamim here are not
thank-offerings, but supplicatory offerings, presented to implore the
gracious assistance of God, and to commemorate the enjoyment of
fellowship with the Lord, through the sacrificial meal associated with
this sacrifice (as in [Jdg 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#004.md); [Sa1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009.md); [Sa2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#025).md).

[Judges 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 20:27</span></span>

Having made these preparations, they inquired of the Lord whether they
should continue the war, and received this reply: "Go up (against
Benjamin); for to-morrow I will give it unto thy hand" (ידך, the hand of
the congregation carrying on the war). To this the supplementary remark
is appended, that the ark of the covenant was at Bethel in those days,
and the high priest served before it. The expression "in those days"
implies that the ark of the covenant was only temporarily at Bethel, and
therefore had been brought thither from the tabernacle at Shiloh during
this war.

[Judges 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 20:29</span></span>

The Victory on the Third Day's Engagement. - [Jdg
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#029.md). The account of this commences
with the most important point, so far as their success was concerned:
Israel set liers in wait (troops in ambush) round about Gibeah.

[Jdg 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#030.md)

They then advanced as on the former occasions.

[Jdg 20:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#031.md)

The Benjaminites came out again to meet the people (of Israel), and were
drawn away from the town (the perfect הנתּקוּ without ו is subordinate
to the preceding verb, and defines more precisely the advance itself,
whilst the mode in which they were drawn away from the town is not
described more fully till [Jdg 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#032.md),
[Jdg 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#033).md), and began to smite the
beaten of the people (who pretended to fly) as formerly upon the roads
(where two roads part), of which one led up to Bethel and the other to
Gibeah, into the field (Gibeah is the town at which the battle took
place, that is to say, somewhere in the neighbourhood, so that a road
might easily run from the field of battle towards the town into the
field), "about (sc., putting to death) thirty men of Israel." This
statement introduces the more precise definition of the חללים.

[Jdg 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#032.md)

Then the Benjaminites supposed that Israel was beaten by them as before;
but the Israelites said: We will flee, and draw it (the tribe of
Benjamin) away from the town to the roads (the high-roads mentioned in
[Jdg 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#031).md). On the Dagesh dirimens in
נתקּוּהוּ, see Ewald, 92, c.

[Jdg 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#033.md)

Carrying out this plan, "all the men of Israel rose up from their
places," i.e., left the place they had occupied, drew back, "and set
themselves in battle array" in Baal-thamar, i.e., palm-place, which
still existed, according to the Onom., in the time of Eusebius, as a
small place in the neighbourhood of Gibeah, bearing the name of
Bethamar. While this was going on, the ambush of Israel broke forth from
its position "from the plains of Geba." The ἁπ. λεγ. מערה, from ערה to
strip, denotes a naked region destitute of wood. גּבע is the masculine
form for גּבעה, and ממּערה־גבע a more precise definition of ממּקומו.
This rendering, which is the one given in the Targum, certainly appears
the simplest explanation of a word that has been rendered in very
different ways, and which the lxx left untranslated as a proper name,
Μαρααγαβέ. The objection raised to this, viz., that a naked level
country was not a place for an ambush, has no force, as there is no
necessity to understand the words as signifying that the treeless
country formed the actual hiding-place of the ambush; but the simple
meaning is, that when the men broke from their hiding-place, they came
from the treeless land towards the town. The rendering given by Rashi,
Trem., and others, "on account of the tripping of Gibeah," is much less
suitable, since, apart from the difficulty of taking מן in different
senses so close together, we should at least expect to find העיר (the
city) instead of גּבע.

[Jdg 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#034.md)

Through the advance of the ambush there came 10,000 picked men of all
Israel "from opposite to Gibeah" (who now attacked in the rear the
Benjaminites who were pursuing the flying army of Israel); "and the
contest became severe, since they (the Benjaminites) did not know that
the calamity was coming upon them."

[Jdg 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035.md)

And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel (according to His promise in
[Jdg 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028).md), so that the Israelites
destroyed of Benjamin on that day twenty and five thousand and an
hundred men (i.e., twenty-five thousand and upwards).

This was the result of the battle, which the historian gives at once,
before entering more minutely into the actual account of the battle
itself. He does this in [Jdg 20:36-46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#036.md)
in a series of explanations, of which one is attached to the other, for
the most part in the form of circumstantial clauses, so that it is not
till [Jdg 20:46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#046.md) that he again comes to
the result already announced in [Jdg
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035.md).

(Note: The opinions expressed by De Wette, etc. that [Jdg
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035.md) is spurious, and by Bertheau,
that [Jdg 20:36-46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#036.md) contain a different
account of the battle, simply prove that they have overlooked this
peculiarity in the Hebrew mode of writing history, viz., that the
generally result of any occurrence is given as early as possible, and
then the details follow afterwards; whilst these critics have not
succeeded in adducing even apparent differences in support of their
opinions.)

[Jdg 20:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#036.md)

The Benjaminites, for instance, saw (this is the proper rendering of
ויּראוּ with vav consec., which merely indicates the order of thought,
not that of time) that they were beaten, and the man of Israel vacated
the field before Benjamin (מקום נתן, to give place by falling back and
flying), because they relied upon the ambush which they had placed
against Gibeah. The Benjaminites did not perceive this till the ambush
fell upon their rear. But the ambush itself, as is added in [Jdg
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#037.md) by way of further explanation,
hastened and fell (fell as quickly as possible) into Gibeah, and went
thither and smote the whole town with the edge of the sword. To this
there is added the further explanation in [Jdg
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#038.md) : "And the arrangement of the
Israelites with the ambush was this: multiply, to cause smoke-rising to
ascend (i.e., cause a great cloud of smoke to ascend) out of the city."
The only objection that can be raised to this view of הרב, as the
imperative Hiphil of רבה, is the suffix ם-attached to להעלותם, since
this is unsuitable to a direct address. This suffix can only be
explained by supposing that there is an admixture of two constructions,
the direct appeal, and the indirect explanation, that they were to cause
to ascend. If this be not admitted, however, we can only follow Studer,
and erase the suffix as an error of the pen occasioned by the following
word משׂאת; for the other course suggested by Bertheau, namely that הרב
should be struck out as a gloss, is precluded by the circumstance that
there is no possible way of explaining the interpolation of so
apparently unsuitable a word into the text. It certainly stood in the
text used by the lxx, though they have most foolishly confounded הרב
with חרב, and rendered it μάχαιρα.

[Jdg 20:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#039.md)

"And the men of Israel turned in the battle:" that is to say, as is
afterwards more fully explained in [Jdg
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#039.md), [Jdg
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#040.md), in the form of a long new
circumstantial clause, whilst Benjamin had begun to smite, etc.
(repeated from [Jdg 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#031.md), [Jdg
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#032).md), and the cloud (המּשׂאת = העשׁן
משׂאת, [Jdg 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#038).md) had begun to ascend
out of the city as a pillar of smoke, and Benjamin turned back, and
behold the whole city ascended towards heaven (in smoke), Israel turned
(fighting) and Benjamin was terrified, for it saw that misfortune had
come upon it (see [Jdg 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#034).md). In [Jdg
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#041.md), the thread of the narrative,
which was interrupted by the long circumstantial clause, is again
resumed by the repetition of "and the men of Israel turned."

[Jdg 20:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#042.md)

The Benjaminites "now turned (flying) before the Israelites to the way
of the desert," i.e., no doubt the desert which rises from Jericho to
the mountains of Bethel ([Jos 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001).md).
They fled therefore towards the north-east; but the battle had overtaken
(reached or seized) them, and those out of the towns (had perished). The
difficult expression מהערים ואשׁר, of which very different, and for the
most part arbitrary, explanations have been given, can only be in
apposition to the suffix attached to the verb: "Benjamin, and in fact
those who had come to the help of Gibeah out of the towns of Benjamin"
(see [Jdg 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#014.md), [Jdg
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015).md), i.e., all the Benjaminites.
The following words, וגו משׁחיתים, are a circumstantial clause
explanatory of the previous clause, הדב המּלחמה: "since they (the men of
Israel) destroyed him (Benjamin) in the midst of it." The singular
suffix בּתוכו does not refer to Benjamin, as this would yield no sense
at all, but to the preceding words, "the way of the desert" (see [Jdg
20:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#045).md). - In [Jdg
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#043.md) the account is continued by
three perfects attached to one another without a copula: "they enclosed
(hedged round) Benjamin, pursued him; at the place of rest they trod him
down to before Gibeah eastwards." מנוּחה is not used adverbially in the
sense of "quietly," which would not give any fitting meaning, but is an
accus. loci, and signifies place of rest, as in [Num
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md). The notice "to before Gibeah"
refers to all three verbs.

[Jdg 20:44](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#044.md)

In this battle there fell of Benjamin 18,000 men, all brave men. The את
before כּל־אלּה is not a preposition, "with" (as the lxx, Cod. Al., and
Bertheau render it), but a sign of the accusative. It serves to show
that the thought which follows is governed by the principal clause, "so
far as all these were concerned, they were brave men."

[Jdg 20:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#045.md)

The remainder fled to the desert, to the rock (of the place) Rimmon,
which is described in the Onom. (s. v. Remmon) as a vicus fifteen Roman
miles to the north of Jerusalem. It has been preserved in the village of
Rummn, which stands upon and around the summit of a conical limestone
mountain, and is visible in all directions (Rob. Pal. ii. p. 113). "And
they (the Israelites) smote as a gleaning upon the roads 5000 men."
עולל, to have a gleaning of the battle, i.e., to smite or slay, as it
were, as a gleaning of the principal battle (vid., [Jer
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009).md). Mesilloth are the high-roads
mentioned in [Jdg 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#031.md). "And pursued
them to Gideom, and smote of them 2000 more." The situation of Gideom,
which is only met with here, is not precisely known; but it must have
been somewhere between Gibeah and Rimmon, as the rock Rimmon, according
to [Jdg 20:47](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#047.md), afforded a safe place
of refuge to the fugitives.

[Jdg 20:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#046.md)

On the total number of the slain, see the remarks on [Jdg
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015.md). - In [Jdg
20:47](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#047.md) the statement already made in
[Jdg 20:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#045.md) with regard to the flight
is resumed; and it is still further related, that 500 men reached the
rock Rimmon, and dwelt there four months, i.e., till the occurrence
described in [Jdg 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#013.md).

[Jdg 20:48](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#048.md)

The Israelites turned (from any further pursuit of the fugitive warriors
of Benjamin) to the children of Benjamin, i.e., to such of the people of
the tribe of Benjamin as were unarmed and defenceless, and smote them
with the edge of the sword, "from the town (or towns) onwards, men to
cattle (i.e., men, women, children, and cattle), to every one who was
found;" i.e., they cut down men and cattle without quarter, from the
towns onwards even to those who were found elsewhere. כּל־הנּמצא עד (to
all that was found) corresponds to מעיר (from the city), and עד־בּהמה
מתם (men to beast) serves as a more precise definition of the עיר
(city): everything that was in the city, man and beast. מתם is pointed
wrongfully for מתם, men, the reading in several MSS and most of the
early editions (see [Deu 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034.md); [Deu
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#006).md). They also set fire to all the
towns that were met with, i.e., all without exception. Thus they did the
same to the Benjaminites as to the Canaanites who were put under the
ban, carrying out the ban with the strictest severity.
