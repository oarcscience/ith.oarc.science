[1 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 3:1</span></span>

The sons and descendants of David. - After the enumeration of the chief
families of the two sons of Hezron, Caleb and Jerahmeel, in 1 Chron
2:18-55, the genealogy of Ram the second son of Hezron, which in [Ch1
2:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#010.md) was only traced down to Jesse,
the father of the royal race of David, is in 1 Chron 3 again taken up
and further followed out. In [Ch1
3:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md) all the sons of David are
enumerated; in [Ch1 3:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010.md), the line
of kings of the house of David from Solomon to Jeconiah and Zedekiah; in
[Ch1 3:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md), the descendants of
Jeconiah to the grandsons of Zerubbabel; and finally, in [Ch1
3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022.md), other descendants of
Shechaniah to the fourth generation.

[Ch1 3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md)

The sons of David: (a) Those born in Hebron; (b) those born in
Jerusalem. - [Ch1 3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md). The six sons
born in Hebron are enumerated also in [Sa2
3:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#002.md), with mention of their mother as
here: but there the second is called כּלאב; here, on the contrary,
דּניּאל, - a difference which cannot well have arisen through an error
of a copyist, but is probably to be explained on the supposition that
this son had two different names. In reference to the others, see on 2
Sam 3. The sing. לו נולד אשׁר after a preceding plural subject is to be
explained as in [Ch1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009.md). שׁני,
without the article, for משׁנהוּ, [Sa2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003.md), or המּשׁנה, [Ch1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012.md), is surprising, as all the other
numbers have the article; but the enumeration, the first-born, a second,
the third, etc., may be justified without any alteration of the text
being necessary. But the difference between our text and that of 2 Sam.
in regard to the second son, shows that the chronicler did not take the
register from 2 Sam 3. The preposition ל before אבשׁלום seems to have
come into the text only through a mistake occasioned by the preceding
לאביגיל, for no reason is apparent for any strong emphasis which might
be implied in the ל being placed on the name of Absalom. The addition of
אשׁתּו to עגלה ([Ch1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#003).md) seems
introduced only to conclude the enumeration in a fitting way, as the
descent of Eglah had not been communicated; just as, for a similar
reason, the additional clause "the wife of David" is inserted in [Sa2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#005.md), without Eglah being thereby
distinguished above the other wives as the most honoured. The concluding
formula, "six were born to him in Hebron" ([Ch1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#004).md), is followed by a notice of how
long David reigned in Hebron and in Jerusalem (cf. [Sa2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#011.md) and [Sa2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#005).md), which is intended to form a
fitting transition to the following list of the sons who were born to
him in Jerusalem.

[Ch1 3:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005.md)

In Jerusalem thirteen other sons were born to him, of whom four were the
children of Bathsheba. The thirteen names are again enumerated in the
history of David, in [Ch1 14:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#007.md),
which in the parallel passage, [Sa2
5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014.md), only eleven are mentioned,
the two last being omitted (see on the passage). Some of the names are
somewhat differently given in these passages, owing the differences of
pronunciation and form: שׁמעה is in both places שׁמוּע; אלישׁמע, between
Ibhar and Eliphalet, is in 1 Chron 14 more correctly written אלישׁוּע.
Elishama is clearly a transcriber's error, occasioned by one of the
following sons bearing this name. אליפלט, shortened in [Ch1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#006.md) into אלפּלט, and נוגה, are
wanting in [Sa2 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#015.md), probably because
they died early. אלידע, [Ch1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#008.md), [Sa2
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#016.md), appears in [Ch1
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#007.md) as בּעלידע; the mother also of
the four first named, בּתשׁוּע, the daughter of Ammiel, is elsewhere
always בּת־שׁבע, e.g., [Sa2 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003.md), and
[Kg1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#011.md), [Kg1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#015.md), etc.; and her father, Eliam
([Sa2 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003).md). בּתשׁוּע has been derived
from בּתשׁוע, and בּתשׁוע is softened from בּתשׁבע; but אליעם has arisen
by transposition of the two parts of the name עמּיאל, or Ammiel has been
altered to Eliam. Besides these, David had also sons by concubines,
whose names, however, are nowhere met with. Of David's daughters only
Tamar is mentioned as "their sister," i.e., sister of the
before-mentioned sons, because she had become known in history through
Amnon's crime (2 Sam 13).

[1 Chronicles 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 3:10</span></span>

The kings of the house of David from Solomon till the exile. - Until
Josiah the individual kings are mentioned in their order, each with the
addition בּנו, son of the preceding, [Ch1
3:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010.md); the only omission being that
of the usurper Athaliah, because she did not belong to the posterity of
David. But in [Ch1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015.md) four sons of
Josiah are mentioned, not "in order to allow of a halt in the long line
of David's descendants after Josiah the great reformer" (Berth.), but
because with Josiah the regular succession to the throne in the house of
David ceased. For the younger son Jehoahaz, who was made king after his
father's death by the people, was soon dethroned by Pharaoh-Necho, and
led away captive to Egypt; and of the other sons Jehoiakim was set up by
Pharaoh, and Zedekiah by Nebuchadnezzar, so that both were only vassals
of heathen lords of the land, and the independent kingship of David came
properly to an end with the death of Josiah. Johanan, the first-born of
the sons of Josiah, is not to be identified with Jehoahaz, whom the
people raised to the throne. For, in the first place, it appears from
the statement as to the ages of Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim in [Kg2
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md), [Kg2
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#036.md); [Ch2
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#002.md), [Ch2
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#005.md), that Jehoahaz was two years
younger than Jehoiakim, and consequently was not the first-born. In [Jer
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011.md) it is expressly declared that
Shallum, the fourth son of Josiah, was king of Judah instead of his
father, and was led away into captivity, and never saw his native land
again, as history narrates of Jehoahaz. From this it would appear that
Shallum took, as king, the name Jehoahaz. Johanan, the first-born, is
not met with again in history, either because he died early, or because
nothing remarkable could be told of him. Jehoiakim was called Eliakim
before he was raised to the throne ([Kg2
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024).md). Zedekiah was at first
Mattaniah ([Kg2 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017).md). Zedekiah, on
his ascending the throne, was younger than Shallum, and that event
occurred eleven years after the accession of Shallum = Jehoahaz.
Zedekiah was only twenty-one years old, while Jehoahaz had become king
in his twenty-third year. But in our genealogy Zedekiah is introduced
after Jehoiakim, and before Shallum, because, on the one hand, Jehoiakim
and Zedekiah had occupied the throne for a longer period, each having
been eleven years king; and on the other, Zedekiah and Shallum were sons
of Hamutal ([Kg2 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md); [Kg2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018).md), while Jehoiakim was the son of
Zebudah ([Kg2 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#036).md). According to
age, they should have followed each other in this order - Johanan,
Jehoiakim, Shallum, and Zedekiah; and in respect to their kingship,
Shallum should have stood before Jehoiakim. But in both cases those born
of the same mother, Hamutal, would have been separated. To avoid this,
apparently, Shallum has been enumerated in the fourth place, along with
his full brother Zedekiah. In [Ch1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#006.md)
it is remarkable that a son of Jehoiakim's son Jeconiah is mentioned,
named Zedekiah, while the sons of Jeconiah follow only in [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md) and [Ch1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018.md). Jeconiah (cf. [Jer
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md); shortened Coniah, [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024.md), [Jer
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028.md), and [Jer
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001).md) is called, as kings, in [Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md). and [Ch2
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009.md), Jehoiachin, another form of the
name, but having the same signification, "Jahve founds or establishes."
Zedekiah can only be a son of Jeconiah, for the בּנו which is added
constantly denotes that the person so called is the son of his
predecessor. Many commentators, certainly, were of opinion that Zedekiah
was the same person as the brother of Jehoiakim mentioned in [Ch1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015.md) under the name Zidkijahu, and who
is here introduced as son of Jeconiah, because he was the successor of
Jeconiah on the throne. For this view support was sought in a reference
to [Ch1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010.md)., in which all Solomon's
successors in the kingship are enumerated in order with בּנו. But all
the kings who succeeded each other from Solomon to Josiah were also,
without exception, sons of their predecessors; so that there בּנו
throughout denotes a proper son, while King Zedekiah, on the contrary,
was not the son, but an uncle of Jeconiah (Jehoiachin). We must
therefore hold צדקיּה for a literal son of Jeconiah, and that so much
the more, because the name צדקיּה differs also from צדקיּהוּ, as the
name of the king is constantly written in [Kg2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017.md). and in [Ch2
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010.md). But mention is made of this
Zedekiah in [Ch1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016.md) apart from the
other sons of Jeconiah ([Ch1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md) and
[Ch1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018).md), perhaps because he was not
led away captive into exile with the others, but died in Judah before
the breaking up of the kingdom.

[1 Chronicles 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 3:17</span></span>

The descendants of the captive and exiled Jeconiah, and other families.
- [Ch1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md). In the list of the son of
Jeconiah it is doubtful if אסּר be the name of a son, or should be
considered, as it is by Luther and others, an appellative, "prisoner,"
in apposition to יכניה, "the sons of Jeconiah, the captive, is
Shealtiel" (A. V. Salathiel). The reasons which have been advanced in
favour of this latter interpretation are: the lack of the conjunction
with שׁאלתּיאל; the position of בּנו after שׁאלת, not after אסּר; and
the circumstance that Assir is nowhere to be met with, either in [Mat
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012.md) or in Seder olam zuta, as an
intervening member of the family between Jeconiah and Shealtiel
(Berth.). But none of these reasons is decisive. The want of the
conjunction proves absolutely nothing, for in [Ch1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018.md) also, the last three names are
grouped together without a conjunction; and the position of בּנו after
שׁאלת is just as strange, whether Shealtiel be the first named son or
the second, for in [Ch1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018.md) other
sons of Jeconiah follow, and the peculiarity of it can only be accounted
for on the supposition that the case of Shealtiel differs from that of
the remaining sons. The omission of Assir in the genealogies in Matthew
and the Seder olam also proves nothing, for in the genealogies
intermediate members are often passed over. Against the appellative
interpretation of the word, on the contrary, the want of the article is
decisive; as apposition to יכניה, it should have the article. But
besides this, according to the genealogy of Jesus in [Luk
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#027.md), Shealtiel is a son of Neri, a
descendant of David, of the lineage of Nathan, not of Solomon; and
according to [Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md), [Hag
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012.md); [Ezr
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md); [Ezr
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002.md), and [Mat
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012.md), Zerubbabel is son of Shealtiel;
while, according to [Ch1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018.md) and [Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md) of our chapter, he is a son of
Pedaiah, a brother of Shealtiel. These divergent statements may be
reconciled by the following combination. The discrepancy in regard to
the enumeration of Shealtiel among the sons of Jeconiah, a descendant of
Solomon, and the statement that he was descended from Neri, a descendant
of Nathan, Solomon's brother, is removed by the supposition that
Jeconiah, besides the Zedekiah mentioned in [Ch1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016.md), who died childless, had another
son, viz., Assir, who left only a daughter, who then, according to the
law as to heiresses ([Num 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#008.md); [Num
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#008)..md), married a man belonging to a
family of her paternal tribe, viz., Neri, of the family of David, in the
line of Nathan, and that from this marriage sprang Shealtiel, Malchiram,
and the other sons (properly grandsons) of Jeconiah mentioned in [Ch1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018.md). If we suppose the eldest of
these, Shealtiel, to come into the inheritance of his maternal
grandfather, he would be legally regarded as his legitimate son. In our
genealogy, therefore, along with the childless Assir, Shealtiel is
introduced as a descendant of Jeconiah, while in Luke he is called,
according to his actual descent, a son of Neri. The other discrepancy in
respect to the descendants of Zerubbabel is to be explained, as has been
already shown on [Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md), by the law
of Levirate marriage, and by the supposition that Shealtiel died without
any male descendants, leaving his wife a widow. In such a case,
according to the law ([Deu 25:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md),
cf. [Mat 22:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#024).md), it became the duty
of one of the brothers of the deceased to marry his brother's widow,
that he might raise up seed, i.e., posterity, to the deceased brother;
and the first son born of this marriage would be legally incorporated
with the family of the deceased, and registered as his son. After
Shealtiel's death, his second brother Pedaiah fulfilled this Levirate
duty, and begat, in his marriage with his sister-in-law, Zerubbabel, who
was now regarded, in all that related to laws of heritage, as
Shealtiel's son, and propagated his race as his heir. According to this
right of heritage, Zerubbabel is called in the passages quoted from
Haggai and Ezra, as also in the genealogy in Matthew, the son of
Shealtiel. The בּנו seems to hint at this peculiar position of Shealtiel
with reference to the proper descendants of Jeconiah, helping to remind
us that he was son of Jeconiah not by natural birth, but only because of
his right of heritage only, on his mother's side. As to the orthography
of the name שׁאלתיאל, see on [Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md).
The six persons named in [Ch1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018.md) are
not sons of Shealtiel, as Kimchi, Hiller, and others, and latterly
Hitzig also, on [Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md), believe, but
his brothers, as the cop. ו before מלפּירם requires. The supposition
just mentioned is only an attempt, irreconcilable with the words of the
text, to form a series, thus: Shealtiel, Pedaiah his son, Zerubbabel his
son, - so as to get rid of the differences between our verse and [Hag
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md); [Ezr
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md). In [Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md) and [Ch1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#020.md), sons and grandsons of Pedaiah
are registered. Nothing further is known of the Bne Jeconiah mentioned
in [Ch1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018.md). Pedaiah's son Zerubbabel
is unquestionably the prince of Judah who returned to Jerusalem in the
reign of Cyrus in the year 536, at the head of a great host of exiles,
and superintended their settlement anew in the land of their fathers
(Ezra 1-6). Of Shimei nothing further is known. In [Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md) and [Ch1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#020.md), the sons of Zerubbabel are
mentioned, and in [Ch1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#021.md) two
grandsons are named. Instead of the singular וּבן some MSS have וּבני,
and the old versions also have the plural. This is correct according to
the sense, although וּבן cannot be objected to on critical grounds, and
may be explained by the writer's having had mainly in view the one son
who continued the line of descendants. By the mention of their sister
after the first two names, the sons of Zerubbabel are divided into two
groups, probably as the descendants of different mothers. How Shelomith
had gained such fame as to be received into the family register, we do
not know. Those mentioned in [Ch1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#020.md)
are brought together in one group by the number "five." חסד יוּשׁב,
"grace is restored," is one name. The grandsons of Zerubbabel, Pelatiah
and Jesaiah, were without doubt contemporaries of Ezra, who returned to
Jerusalem from Babylon seventy-eight years after Zerubbabel.

After these grandsons of Zerubbabel, there are ranged in [Ch1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#021.md), without any copula whatever,
four families, the sons of Rephaiah, the sons of Arnan, etc.; and of the
last named of these, the sons of Shecaniah, four generations of
descendants are enumerated in [Ch1
3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022.md), without any hint as to the
genealogical connection of Shecaniah with the grandsons of Zerubbabel.
The assertion of more modern critics, Ewald, Bertheau, and others, that
Shecaniah was a brother or a son of Pelatiah or Jesaiah, and that
Zerubbabel's family is traced down through six generations, owes its
origin to the wish to gain support for the opinion that the Chronicle
was composed long after Ezra, and is without any foundation. The
argument of Bertheau, that "since the sons of Rephaiah, etc., run
parallel with the preceding names Pelatiah and Jesaiah, and since the
continuation of the list in [Ch1 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022.md)
is connected with the last mentioned Shecaniah, we cannot but believe
that Pelatiah, Jesaiah, Rephaiah, Arnan, Obadiah, and Shecaniah are,
without exception, sons of Hananiah," would be well founded if, and only
if, the names Rephaiah, Arnan, etc., stood in our verse, instead of the
sons of Rephaiah, the sons of Arnan, etc., for Pelatiah and Jesaiah are
not parallel with the sons of Arnan. Pelatiah and Jesaiah may perhaps be
sons of Hananiah, but not the sons of Rephaiah, Arnan, etc. These would
be grandsons of Hananiah, on the assumption that Rephaiah, Arnan, etc.,
were brothers of Pelatiah and Jesaiah, and sons of Hananiah. But for
this assumption there is no tenable ground; it would be justified only
if our present Masoretic text could lay claim to infallibility. Only on
the ground of a belief in this infallibility of the traditional text
could we explain to ourselves, as Bertheau does, the ranging of the sons
of Rephaiah, the sons of Arnan, etc., along with Pelatiah and Jesaiah,
called sons of Hananiah, by supposing that Rephaiah, Arnan, Obadiah, and
Shecaniah are not named as individuals, but are mentioned together with
their families, because they were the progenitors of famous races, while
Pelatiah and Jesaiah either had no descendants at all, or none at least
who were at all renowned. The text, as we have it, in which the sons of
Rephaiah, etc., follow the names of the grandsons of Zerubbabel without
a conjunction, and in which the words שׁכניה וּבני, and a statement of
the names of one of these בּנים and his further descendants, follow the
immediately preceding שׁכניה בּני, has no meaning, and is clearly
corrupt, as has been recognised by Heidegger, Vitringa, Carpzov, and
others. Owing, however, to want of information from other sources
regarding these families and their connection with the descendants of
Zerubbabel, we have no means whatever of restoring the original text.
The sons of Rephaiah, the sons of Arnan, etc., were, it may be supposed,
branches of the family of David, whose descent or connection with
Zerubbabel is for us unascertainable. The list from רפיה בּני, [Ch1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#021.md), to the end of the chapter, is a
genealogical fragment, which has perhaps come into the text of the
Chronicle at a later time.

(Note: Yet at a very early time, for the lxx had before them our present
text, and sought to make sense of it by expressing the four times
recurring בּני, [Ch1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#021.md), by the
singular בּנו in every case, as follows: καὶ Ἰεσίας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ, Ῥαφὰλ
υἱὸς αὐτοῦ, Ὀρνὰ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ, etc.; according to which, between Hananiah
and Shecaniah seven consecutive generations would be enumerated, and
Zerubbabel's family traced down through eleven generations. So also
Vulg. and Syr.)

Many of the names which this fragment contains are met with singly in
genealogies of other tribes, but nowhere in a connection from which we
might drawn conclusions as to the origin of the families here
enumerated, and the age in which they lived. Bertheau, indeed, thinks
"we may in any case hold Hattush, [Ch1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022.md), for the descendant of David of
the same name mentioned in [Ezr 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#002.md),
who lived at the time of Ezra;" but he has apparently forgotten that,
according to his interpretation of our verse, Hattush would be a
great-grandson of Zerubbabel, who, even if he were then born, could not
possibly have been a man and the head of a family at the time of his
supposed return from Babylon with Ezra, seventy-eight years after the
return of his great-grandfather to Palestine. Other men too, even
priests, have borne the name Hattush; cf. [Neh
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#010.md); [Neh
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#005.md); [Neh
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#002.md). There returned, moreover, from
Babylon with Ezra sons of Shecaniah ([Ezr
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#003).md), who may as justly be identified
with the sons of Shecaniah mentioned in [Ch1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022.md) of our chapter as forefathers or
ancestors of Hattush, as the Hattush here is identified with the Hattush
of [Ezr 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#002.md). But from the fact that,
in the genealogy of Jesus, Matt 1, not a single one of the names of
descendants of Zerubbabel there enumerated coincides with the names
given in our verses, we may conclude that the descendants of Shecaniah
enumerated in [Ch1 3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022.md) did not
descend from Zerubbabel in a direct line. Intermediate members are, it
is true, often omitted in genealogical lists; but who would maintain
that in Matthew seven, or, according to the other interpretation of our
verse, nine, consecutive members have been at one bound overleapt? This
weighty consideration, which has been brought forward by Clericus, is
passed over in silence by the defenders of the opinion that our verses
contain a continuation of the genealogy of Zerubbabel. The only other
remark to be made about this fragment is, that in [Ch1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022.md) the number of the sons of
Shecaniah is given as six, while only five names are mentioned, and that
consequently a name must have fallen out by mistake in transcribing.
Nothing further can be said of these families, as they are otherwise
quite unknown.
