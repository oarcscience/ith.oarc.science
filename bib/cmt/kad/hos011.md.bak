### [Hosea Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 11:1</span></span>

The prophet goes back a third time (cf. [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md); [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010).md) to the early times of Israel,
and shows how the people had repaid the Lord, for all the proofs of His
love, with nothing but ingratitude and unfaithfulness; so that it would
have merited utter destruction from off the earth, if God should not
restrain His wrath for the sake of His unchangeable faithfulness, in
order that, after severely chastening, He might gather together once
more those that were rescued from among the heathen. [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md). "When Israel was young, then I
loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt. [Hos
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002.md). Men called to them; so they went
away from their countenance: they offer sacrifice to the Baals, and burn
incense to the idols." [Hos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md) rests
upon [Exo 4:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md), where the Lord
directs Moses to say to Pharaoh, "Israel is my first-born son; let my
son go, that he may serve me." Israel was the son of Jehovah, by virtue
of its election to be Jehovah's peculiar people (see at [Exo
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022).md). In this election lay the ground
for the love which God showed to Israel, by bringing it out of Egypt, to
give it the land of Canaan, promised to the fathers for its inheritance.
The adoption of Israel as the son of Jehovah, which began with its
deliverance out of the bondage of Egypt, and was completed in the
conclusion of the covenant at Sinai, forms the first stage in the
carrying out of the divine work of salvation, which was completed in the
incarnation of the Son of God for the redemption of mankind from death
and ruin. The development and guidance of Israel as the people of God
all pointed to Christ; not, however, in any such sense as that the
nation of Israel was to bring forth the son of God from within itself,
but in this sense, that the relation which the Lord of heaven and earth
established and sustained with that nation, was a preparation for the
union of God with humanity, and paved the way for the incarnation of His
Son, by the fact that Israel was trained to be a vessel of divine grace.
All essential factors in the history of Israel point to this as their
end, and thereby become types and material prophecies of the life of Him
in whom the reconciliation of man to God was to be realized, and the
union of God with the human race to be developed into a personal unity.
It is in this sense that the second half of our verse is quoted in [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015.md) as a prophecy of Christ, not
because the words of the prophet refer directly and immediately to
Christ, but because the sojourn in Egypt, and return out of that land,
had the same significance in relation to the development of the life of
Jesus Christ, as it had to the nation of Israel. Just as Israel grew
into a nation in Egypt, where it was out of the reach of Canaanitish
ways, so was the child Jesus hidden in Egypt from the hostility of
Herod. But [Hos 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002.md) is attached thus
as an antithesis: this love of its God was repaid by Israel with base
apostasy. קראוּ, they, viz., the prophets (cf. [Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md); [Kg2
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013.md); [Jer
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025.md); [Jer
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#004.md); [Zac
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#004).md), called to them, called the
Israelites to the Lord and to obedience to Him; but they (the
Israelites) went away from their countenance, would not hearken to the
prophets, or come to the Lord ([Jer
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031).md). The thought is strengthened by
כּן, with the כּאשׁר of the protasis omitted (Ewald, 360, a): as the
prophets called, so the Israelites drew back from them, and served
idols. בּעלים as in [Hos 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015.md), and
פּסלים as in [Kg2 17:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#041.md) and [Deu
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005.md), [Deu
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025.md) (see at [Exo
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004).md).

[Hosea 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 11:3</span></span>

Nevertheless the Lord continued to show love to them. [Hos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md), [Hos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004.md). "And I, I have taught Ephraim to
walk: He took them in His arms, and they did not know that I healed
them. I drew them with bands of a man, with cords of love, and became to
them like a lifter up of the yoke upon their jaws, and gently towards
him did I give (him) food." תּרגּלתּי, a hiphil, formed after the
Aramaean fashion (cf. Ges. 55, 5), by hardening the ה into ת, and
construed with ל, as the hiphil frequently is (e.g., [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md); [Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009).md), a denom. of רגל, to teach to
walk, to guide in leading-strings, like a child that is being trained to
walk. It is a figurative representation of paternal care foz a child's
prosperity. קחם, per aphaeresin, for לקחם, like קח for לקח in [Eze
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#005.md). The sudden change from the first
person to the third seems very strange to our ears; but it is not
uncommon in Hebrew, and is to be accounted for here from the fact, that
the prophet could very easily pass from speaking in the name of God to
speaking of God Himself. קח cannot be either an infinitive or a
participle, on account of the following word זרועתיו, his arms. The two
clauses refer chiefly to the care and help afforded by the Lord to His
people in the Arabian desert; and the prophet had [Deu
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031.md) floating before his mind: "in the
wilderness the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son." The
last clause also refers to this, רפאתים pointing back to [Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026.md), where the Lord showed Himself
as the physician of Israel, by making the bitter water at Marah
drinkable, and at the same time as their helper out of every trouble. In
[Hos 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004.md), again, there is a still
further reference to the manifestation of the love of God to Israel on
the journey through the wilderness. חבלי אדם, cords with which men are
led, more especially children that are weak upon their feet, in contrast
with ropes, with which men control wild, unmanageable beasts ([Psa
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009).md), are a figurative representation
of the paternal, human guidance of Israel, as explained in the next
figure, "cords of love." This figure leads on to the kindred figure of
the yoke laid upon beasts, to harness them for work. As merciful masters
lift up the yoke upon the cheeks of their oxen, i.e., push it so far
back that the animals can eat their food in comfort, so has the Lord
made the yoke of the law, which has been laid upon His people, both soft
and light. As הרים על על does not mean to take the yoke away from (מעל)
the cheeks, but to lift it above the cheeks, i.e., to make it easier, by
pushing it back, we cannot refer the words to the liberation of Israel
from the bondage of Egypt, but can only think of what the Lord did, to
make it easy for the people to observe the commandments imposed upon
them, when they were received into His covenant ([Exo
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003.md), [Exo
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007).md), including not only the many
manifestations of mercy which might and ought to have allured them to
reciprocate His love, and yield a willing obedience to His commandments,
but also the means of grace provided in their worship, partly in the
institution of sacrifice, by which a way of approach was opened to
divine grace to obtain forgiveness of sin, and partly in the institution
of feasts, at which they could rejoice in the gracious gifts of their
God. ואט is not the first pers. imperf. hiphil of נטה ("I inclined
myself to him;" Symm., Syr., and others), in which case we should expect
ואט, but an adverb, softly, comfortably; and אליו belongs to it, after
the analogy of [Sa2 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#005.md). אוכיל is an
anomalous formation for אאכיל, like אוביד for אאביד in [Jer
46:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#008.md) (cf. Ewald, 192, d; Ges. 68, 2,
Anm. 1). Jerome has given the meaning quite correctly: "and I gave them
manna for food in the desert, which they enjoyed."

[Hosea 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 11:5</span></span>

By despising this love, Israel brings severe punishment upon itself.
[Hos 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md). "It will not return into
the land of Egypt; but Asshur, he is its king, because they refused to
return. [Hos 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006.md). And the sword will
sweep round in its cities, and destroy its bolts, and devour, because of
their counsels. [Hos 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md). My people
is bent upon apostasy from me: and if men call it upwards, it does not
raise itself at all." The apparent contradiction between the words, "It
will not return into the land of Egypt," and the threat contained in
[Hos 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md); [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md), that Israel should return to
Egypt, ought not to lead us to resort to alterations of the text, or to
take לא in the sense of לו, and connect it with the previous verse, as
is done by the lxx, Mang., and others, or to make an arbitrary
paraphrase of the words, either by taking לא in the sense of הלא, and
rendering it as a question, "Should it not return?" equivalent to "it
will certainly return" (Maurer, Ewald, etc.); or by understanding the
return to Egypt as signifying the longing of the people for help from
Egypt (Rosenmller). The emphatic הוּא of the second clause is at
variance with all these explanations, since they not only fail to
explain it, but it points unmistakeably to an antithesis: "Israel will
not return to Egypt; but Asshur, it shall be its king," i.e., it shall
come under the dominion of Assyria. The supposed contradiction is
removed as soon as we observe that in [Hos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md); [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md), [Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md), Egypt is a type of the land of
bondage; whereas here the typical interpretation is precluded partly by
the contrast to Asshur, and still more by the correspondence in which
the words stand to [Hos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md). Into the
land from which Jehovah called His people, Israel shall not return, lest
it should appear as though the object, for which it had been brought out
of Egypt and conducted miraculously through the desert, had been
frustrated by the impenitence of the people. But it is to be brought
into another bondage. ואשּׁוּר is appended adversatively. Asshur shall
rule over it as king, because they refuse to return, sc. to Jehovah. The
Assyrians will wage war against the land, and conquer it. The sword
(used as a principal weapon, to denote the destructive power of war)
will circulate in the cities of Israel, make the round of the cities as
it were, and destroy its bolts, i.e., the bolts of the gates of the
fortifications of Ephraim. Baddı̄m, poles ([Exo
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#013)..md), cross-poles or cross-beams,
with which the gates were fastened, hence bolts in the literal sense, as
in [Job 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016.md), and not tropically for
"princes" (Ges.), electi (Jer., Chald., etc.). "On account of their
counsels:" this is more fully defined in [Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md). נעמּי, and my people (= since my
people) are harnessed to apostasy from me (meshūbhâthı̄, with an
objective suffix). תּלוּאים, lit., suspended on apostasy, i.e., not
"swaying about in consequence of apostasy or in constant danger of
falling away" (Chald., Syr., Hengst.), since this would express too
little in the present context and would not suit the second half of the
verse, but impaled or fastened upon apostasy as upon a stake, so that it
cannot get loose. Hence the constructing of תּלה with ל instead of על or
ב ([Sa2 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#010).md), may be accounted for
from the use of the verb in a figurative sense. על־על, upwards (על as in
[Hos 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016).md), do they (the prophets: see
[Hos 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002).md) call them; but it does not
rise, sc. to return to God, or seek help from on high. רומם pilel, with
the meaning of the kal intensified, to make a rising, i.e., to rise up.
This explanation appears simpler than supplying an object, say "the
soul" ([Psa 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001).md), or "the eyes" ([Eze
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#025).md).

[Hosea 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 11:8</span></span>

They deserved to be utterly destroyed for this, and would have been if
the compassion of God had not prevented it. With this turn a transition
is made in [Hos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md) from threatening
to promise. [Hos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md). "How could I
give thee up, O Ephraim! surrender thee, O Israel! how could I give thee
up like Admah, make thee like Zeboim! My heart has changed within me, my
compassion is excited all at once. [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md). I will not execute the burning
heat of my wrath, I will not destroy Ephraim again: for I am God, and
not man, the Holy One in the midst of thee: and come not into burning
wrath." "How thoroughly could I give thee up!" sc. if I were to punish
thy rebellion as it deserved. Nâthan, to surrender to the power of the
enemy, like miggēn in [Gen 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#020.md). And
not that alone, but I could utterly destroy thee, like Admah and Zeboim,
the two cities of the valley of Siddim, which were destroyed by fire
from heaven along with Sodom and Gomorrha. Compare [Deu
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md), where Admah and Zeboim are
expressly mentioned along with the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha, which
stand alone in [Gen 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md). With
evident reference to this passage, in which Moses threatens idolatrous
Israel with the same punishment, Hosea simply mentions the last two as
quite sufficient for his purpose, whereas Sodom and Gomorrha are
generally mentioned in other passages ([Jer
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018.md); cf. [Mat
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#015.md); [Luk
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#012).md). The promise that God will show
compassion is appended here, without any adversative particle. My heart
has turned, changed in me (על, lit., upon or with me, as in the similar
phrases in [Sa1 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#036.md); [Jer
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#018).md). יחד נכמרוּ, in a body have my
feelings of compassion gathered themselves together, i.e., my whole
compassion is excited. Compare [Gen
43:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#030.md) and [Kg1
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#026.md), where, instead of the abstract
nichūmı̄m, we find the more definite rachămı̄m, the bowels as the seat of
the emotions. עשׂה חרון אף, to carry out wrath, to execute it as
judgment (as in [Sa1 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#018).md). In the
expression לא אשׁוּב לשׁחת, I will not return to destroy, שׁוּב may be
explained from the previous נהפּך לבּי. After the heart of God has
changed, it will not return to wrath, to destroy Ephraim; for Jehovah is
God, who does not alter His purposes like a man (cf. [Sa1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029.md); [Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md); [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006).md), and He shows Himself in Israel
as the Holy One, i.e., the absolutely pure and perfect one, in whom
there is no alternation of light and darkness, and therefore no
variableness in His decrees (see at [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md); [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003).md). The difficult expression בּעיר
cannot mean "into a city," although it is so rendered by the ancient
versions, the Rabbins, and many Christian expositors; for we cannot
attach any meaning to the words "I do not come into a city" at all in
harmony with the context. עיר signifies here aestus irae, the heat of
wrath, from עוּר, effervescere, just as in [Jer
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008.md) it signifies the heat of alarm
and anxiety, aestus animi.

[Hosea 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 11:10</span></span>

"They will go after Jehovah; like a lion will He roar; for He will roar:
and sons will tremble from the sea. [Hos
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md). Tremble like birds out of
Egypt, and like doves out of the land of Asshur: and I cause them to
dwell in their houses, is the saying of Jehovah." When the Lord turns
His pity towards the people once more, they will follow Him, and hasten,
with trembling at His voice, from the lands of their banishment, and be
reinstated by Him in their inheritance. The way for this promise was
opened indeed by [Hos 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md), but here
it is introduced quite abruptly, and without any logical particle of
connection, like the same promise in [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md). הלך אחרי יי, to walk after the
Lord, denotes not only "obedience to the gathering voice of the Lord, as
manifested by their drawing near" (Simson), but that walking in true
obedience to the Lord which follows from conversion ([Deu
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005.md); [Kg1
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#008).md), so that the Chaldee has very
properly rendered it, "They will follow the worship of Jehovah." This
faithfulness they will exhibit first of all in practical obedience to
the call of the Lord. This call is described as the roaring of a lion,
the point of comparison lying simply in the fact that a lion announces
its coming by roaring, so that the roaring merely indicates a loud,
far-reaching call, like the blowing of the trumpet in [Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013.md). The reason for what is affirmed
is then given: "for He (Jehovah) will really utter His call," in
consequence of which the Israelites, as His children, will come
trembling (chârēd synonymous with pâchad, [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005).md). מיּם, from the sea, i.e., from
the distant islands and lands of the west ([Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011).md), as well as from Egypt and
Assyria, the lands of the south and east. These three regions are simply
a special form of the idea, "out of all quarters of the globe;" compare
the more complete enumeration of the several remote countries in [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md). The comparison to birds and
doves expresses the swiftness with which they draw near, as doves fly to
their dovecots ([Isa 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008).md). Then will
the Lord cause them to dwell in their houses, i.e., settle them once
more in their inheritance, in His own land (cf. [Jer
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037), where לבטח is added.md). On the
construing of הושׁיב with על, cf. [Kg1
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#043.md), and the German auf der Stube
sein. The expression נאם יי affixes the seal of confirmation to this
promise. The fulfilment takes place in the last says, when Israel as a
nation shall enter the kingdom of God. Compare the remarks on this point
at [Hos 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001.md).
