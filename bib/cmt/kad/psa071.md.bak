Prayer of a Grey-Headed Servant of God for Further Divine Aid

The Davidic [Psa 70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md) is followed by
an anonymous Psalm which begins like Ps 31 and closes like Ps 35, in
which [Psa 71:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#012.md), just like [Psa
70:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#002.md), is an echo of [Psa
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md). The whole Psalm is an echo of
the language of older Psalms, which is become the mental property, so to
speak, of the author, and is revived in him by experiences of a similar
character. Notwithstanding the entire absence of any thorough
originality, it has an individual, and in fact a Jeremianic, impress.

The following reasons decide us in considering the Psalm as coming from
the pen of Jeremiah: - (1) Its relationship to Psalms of the time of
David and of the earlier times of the kings, but after David, leads us
down to somewhere about the age of Jeremiah. (2) This anthological
weaving together of men's own utterances taken from older original
passages, and this skilful variation of them by merely slight touches of
his own, is exactly Jeremiah's manner. (3) In solitary instances the
style of Ps 69, slow, loose, only sparingly adorned with figures, and
here and there prosaic, closely resembles Jeremiah; also to him
corresponds the situation of the poet as one who is persecuted; to him,
the retrospect of a life rich in experience and full of miraculous
guidings; to him, whose term of active service extended over a period of
more than thirty years under Zedekiah, the transition to hoary age in
which the poet finds himself; to him, the reference implied in [Psa
71:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#021.md) to some high office; and to him,
the soft, plaintive strain that pervades the Psalm, from which it is at
the same time clearly seen that the poet has attained a degree of age
and experience, in which he is accustomed to self-control and is not
discomposed by personal misfortune. To all these correspondences there
is still to be added an historical testimony. The lxx inscribes the
Psalm τῷ Δαυίδ υἱῷν Ἰωναδάβ καὶ τῶν πρώτων αἰχμαλωτισθέντων. According
to this inscription, the τῷ Δαυίδ of which is erroneous, but the second
part of which is so explicit that it must be based upon tradition, the
Psalm was a favourite song of the Rechabites and of the first exiles.
The Rechabites are that tribe clinging to a homely nomad life in
accordance with the will of their father, which Jeremiah (Jer 35) holds
up before the men of his time as an example of self-denying faithful
adherence to the law of their father which puts them to shame. If the
Psalm is by Jeremiah, it is just as intelligible that the Rechabites, to
whom Jeremiah paid such a high tribute of respect, should appropriate it
to their own use, as that the first exiles should do so. Hitzig infers
from [Psa 71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020.md), that at the time of
its composition Jerusalem had already fallen; whereas in Ps 69 it is
only the cities of Judah that as yet lie in ashes. But after the
overthrow of Jerusalem we find no circumstances in the life of the
prophet, who is no more heard of in Egypt, that will correspond to the
complaints of the psalmist of violence and mockery. Moreover the foe in
[Psa 71:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#004.md) is not the Chaldaean, whose
conduct towards Jeremiah did not merit these names. Nor can [Psa
71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020.md) have been written at the time of
the second siege and in the face of the catastrophe.

[Psalms 71:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 71:1</span></span>

Stayed upon Jahve, his ground of trust, from early childhood up, the
poet hopes and prays for deliverance out of the hand of the foe. The
first of these two strophes ([Psa
71:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#001).md) is taken from [Psa
31:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002.md), the second ([Psa
71:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#004.md), with the exception of [Psa
71:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#004.md) and [Psa
71:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#006).md) from [Psa
22:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010.md); both, however, in comparison
with [Psa 70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md) exhibit the far more
encroaching variations of a poet who reproduces the language of others
with a freer hand. Olshausen wishes to read מעוז in [Psa
71:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#003.md), [Psa
90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001.md); [Psa
91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md), instead of מעון, which he holds
to be an error in writing. But this old Mosaic, Deuteronomial word
(vid., on [Psa 90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001).md) - cf. the
post-biblical oath המעון (by the Temple!) - is unassailable. Jahve, who
is called a rock of refuge in [Psa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#003.md), is here called a rock of
habitation, i.e., a high rock that cannot be stormed or scaled, which
affords a safe abode; and this figure is pursued still further with a
bold remodelling of the text of [Psa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#003.md) : לבוא תּמיד, constantly to go
into, i.e., which I can constantly, and therefore always, as often as it
is needful, betake myself for refuge. The additional צוּית is certainly
not equivalent to צוּה; it would more likely be equivalent to אשׁר צוית;
but probably it is an independent clause: Thou hast (in fact) commanded,
i.e., unalterably determined ([Psa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005.md); [Psa
68:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029.md); [Psa
133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003).md), to show me salvation, for my
rock, etc. To the words לבוא תמיד צוית corresponds the expression לבית
מצודות in [Psa 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#003.md), which the lxx
renders καὶ εἰς οἶκον καταφυγῆς, whereas instead of the former three
words it has καὶ εἰς τόπον ὀχυρόν, and seems to have read לבית מבצרות,
cf. [Dan 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#015) (Hitzig.md). In [Psa
71:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#005.md), Thou art my hope reminds one of
the divine name מקוה ישׂראל in [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md); [Jer
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#007.md) (cf. ἡ ἐλπίς ἡμῶν used of Christ
in [Ti1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md); [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027).md). נסמכתּי is not less beautiful
than השׁלכתּי in [Psa 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#011.md). In its
incipient slumbering state (cf. [Psa
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006).md), and in its self-conscious
continuance. He was and is the upholding prop and the supporting
foundation, so to speak, of my life. And גוזי instead of גּחי in [Psa
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010.md), is just such another felicitous
modification. It is impracticable to define the meaning of this גוזי
according to גּזה = גּזה, Arab. jz', retribuere (prop. to cut up,
distribute), because גּמל is the representative of this Aramaeo-Arabic
verb in the Hebrew. Still less, however, can it be derived from גּוּז,
transire, the participle of which, if it would admit of a transitive
meaning = מוציאי (Targum), ought to be גּזי. The verb גּזה, in
accordance with its radical signification of abscindere (root גז, synon.
קץ, קד, קט, and the like), denotes in this instance the separating of
the child from the womb of the mother, the retrospect going back from
youth to childhood, and even to his birth. The lxx σκεπαστής (μου) is an
erroneous reading for ἐκσπαστής, as is clear from [Psa
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010.md), ὁ ἐκσπάσας με. הלּל בּ, [Psa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009.md) (cf. שׂיח בּ, [Psa
69:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#013).md), is at the bottom of the
expression in [Psa 71:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#006.md). The God to
whom he owes his being, and its preservation thus far, is the constant,
inexhaustible theme of his praise.

[Psalms 71:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 71:7</span></span>

Brought safely through dangers of every kind, he is become כּמופת, as a
wonder, a miracle (Arabic aft from afata, cognate afaka, הפך, to bend,
distort: a turning round, that which is turned round or wrenched, i.e.,
that which is contrary to what is usual and looked for) to many, who
gaze upon him as such with astonishment ([Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004).md). It is his God, however, to
whom, as hitherto so also in time to come, he will look to be thus
wonderfully preserved: מחסי־עז, as in [Sa2
22:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#033.md). עז is a genitive, and the
suffix is thrown back (vid., supra, p 171) in order that what God is to,
and does for, the poet may be brought forward more clearly and
independently \[lit. unalloyed\]. [Psa
71:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#008.md) tells us what it is that he
firmly expects on the ground of what he possesses in God. And on this
very ground arises the prayer of [Psa
71:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#009.md) also: Cast me not away (viz.,
from Thy presence, [Psa 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013.md); [Jer
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#015), and frequently.md) in the time
(לעת, as in [Gen 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#011).md) of old age - he
is therefore already an old man (זקן), though only just at the beginning
of the זקנה. He supplicates favour for the present and for the time
still to come: now that my vital powers are failing, forsake me not!
Thus he prays because he, who has been often wondrously delivered, is
even now threatened by foes. [Psa
71:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011.md), introduced by means of [Psa
71:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#010.md), tells us what their thoughts of
him are, and what they purpose doing. לי, [Psa
71:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#010.md), does not belong to אויבי, as it
dies not in [Psa 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md) also, and
elsewhere. The ל is that of relation or of reference, as in [Psa
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#006.md). The unnecessary לאמר betrays a
poet of the later period; cf. [Psa
105:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011.md); [Psa
119:82](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#082.md) (where it was less
superfluous), and on the contrary, [Psa
83:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005.md). The later poet also reveals
himself in [Psa 71:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#012.md), which is an
echo of very similar prayers of David in [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md), [Psa
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020.md) ([Psa
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md), cf. [Psa
70:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#002).md), [Psa
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#022.md); [Psa
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#022.md). The Davidic style is to be
discerned here throughout in other points also. In place of הישׁה the
Ker substitutes חוּשׁה, which is the form exclusively found elsewhere.

[Psalms 71:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 71:13</span></span>

In view of [Psa 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015.md) ([Psa
70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003).md), [Psa
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md), [Psa
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026.md); [Psa
109:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#029.md), and other passages, the
reading of יכּלמוּ, with the Syriac, instead of יכלוּ in [Psa
71:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#013.md) commends itself; but there are
also other instances in this Psalm of a modification of the original
passages, and the course of the thoughts is now climactic: confusion,
ruin (cf. Ps 6:11), and in fact ruin accompanied by reproach and shame.
This is the fate that the poet desires for his deadly foes. In prospect
of this he patiently composes himself, [Psa
71:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#014) (cf. 31:25.md); and when righteous
retribution appears, he will find new matter and ground and motive for
the praise of God in addition to all such occasion as he has hitherto
had. The late origin of the Psalm betrays itself again here; for instead
of the praet. Hiph. הוסיף (which is found only in the Books of Kings and
in Ecclesiastes), the older language made use of the praet. Ka. Without
ceasing shall his mouth tell (ספּר, as in [Jer
51:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#010).md) of God's righteousness, of
God's salvation for he knows not numbers, i.e., the counting over or
through of them ([Psa 139:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017)..md);

(Note: The lxx renders οὐκ ἔγνων πραγματείας; the Psalterium Romanum,
non cognovi negotiationes; Psalt. Gallicum (Vulgate), non cognovi
literaturam (instead of which the Psalt. Hebr., literaturas). According
to Bttcher, the poet really means that he did not understand the art of
writing.)

the divine proofs of righteousness or salvation עצמוּ מסּפּר ([Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006).md), they are in themselves endless,
and therefore the matter also which they furnish for praise is
inexhaustible. He will tell those things which cannot be so reckoned up;
he will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord Jahve, and with praise
acknowledge His righteousness, Him alone. Since גּברות, like the New
Testament δυνάμεις, usually signifies the proofs of the divine גּבוּרה
(e.g., [Psa 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007).md), the Beth is the
Beth of accompaniment, as e.g., in [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md); [Psa
66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013.md). בּוא בּ, vernire cum, is like
Arab. j'â' b (atâ), equivalent to afferre, he will bring the proofs of
the divine power, this rich material, with him. It is evident from [Psa
71:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#018.md). that בגברות does not refer to
the poet (in the fulness of divine strength), but, together with צדקתך,
forms a pair of words that have reference to God. לבדּך, according to
the sense, joins closely upon the suffix of צדקתך (cf. Ps 83:19): Thy
righteousness (which has been in mercy turned towards me), Thine alone
(te solum = tui solius). From youth up God has instructed him, viz., in
His ways ([Psa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004).md), which are worthy
of all praise, and hitherto (עד־הנּה, found only in this passage in the
Psalter, and elsewhere almost entirely confined to prose) has he, "the
taught of Jahve" (למּוּד ה), had to praise the wonders of His rule and
of His leadings. May God, then, not forsake him even further on עד־זקנה
ושׂיבה. The poet is already old (זקן), and is drawing ever nearer to
שׂיבה, silvery, hoary old age (cf. [Sa1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#002).md). May God, then, in this stage of
life also to which he has attained, preserve him in life and in His
favour, until (עד = עד־אשׁר, as in [Psa
132:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#005.md); [Gen
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#011), and frequently.md) he shall have
declared His arm, i.e., His mighty interposition in human history, to
posterity (דּור), and to all who shall come (supply אשׁר), i.e., the
whole of the future generation, His strength, i.e., the impossibility of
thwarting His purposes. The primary passage for this is [Psa
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031.md).

[Psalms 71:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 71:19</span></span>

The thought of this proclamation so thoroughly absorbs the poet that he
even now enters upon the tone of it; and since to his faith the
deliverance is already a thing of the past, the tender song with its
uncomplaining prayer dies away into a loud song of praise, in which he
pictures it all to himself. Without [Psa
71:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#019.md) being subordinate to עד־אגיד
in [Psa 71:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#018.md), וצדקתך is coupled by
close connection with בגורתך. [Psa
71:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#019.md) is an independent clause; and
עד־מרום takes the place of the predicate: the righteousness of God
exceeds all bounds, is infinite ([Psa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006.md)., [Psa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011).md). The cry כמוך מי, as in [Psa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010.md); [Psa
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md), [Jer
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006.md), refers back to [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md). According to the Chethb, the
range of the poet's vision widens in [Psa
71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020.md) from the proofs of the strength
and righteousness of God which he has experienced in his own case to
those which he has experienced in common with others in the history of
his own nation. The Ker (cf. on the other hand [Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005.md); [Psa
85:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#007.md); [Deu
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017).md) rests upon a failing to discern
how the experiences of the writer are interwoven with those of the
nation. תּשׁוּב in both instances supplies the corresponding adverbial
notion to the principal verb, as in [Psa
85:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#007.md) (cf. [Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004).md). תּהום, prop. a rumbling,
commonly used of a deep heaving of waters, here signifies an abyss. "The
abysses of the earth" (lxx ἐκ τῶν ἀβύσσων τῆς γῆς, just as the old
Syriac version renders the New Testament ἄβυσσος, e.g., in [Luk
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#031), by Syr. tehūmā'.md) are, like the
gates of death ([Psa 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014).md), a figure
of extreme perils and dangers, in the midst of which one is as it were
half hidden in the abyss of Hades. The past and future are clearly
distinguished in the sequence of the tenses. When God shall again raise
His people out of the depth of the present catastrophe, then will He
also magnify the גּדלּה of the poet, i.e., in the dignity of his office,
by most brilliantly vindicating him in the face of his foes, and will
once more (תּסּוב, fut. Niph. like תּשׁוּב ekil .h above) comfort him.
He on his part will also (cf. [Job
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#014).md) be grateful for this national
restoration and this personal vindication: he will praise God, will
praise His truth, i.e., His fidelity to His promises. בּכלי נבל instead
of בּנבל sounds more circumstantial than in the old poetry. The divine
name "The Holy One of Israel" occurs here for the third time in the
Psalter; the other passages are [Psa
78:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#041.md); [Psa
89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md), which are older in time, and
older also than Isaiah, who uses it thirty times, and Habakkuk, who uses
it once. Jeremiah has it twice ([Jer
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md); [Jer
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#005).md), and that after the example of
Isaiah. In [Psa 71:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#023.md), [Psa
71:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#024.md) the poet means to say that lips
and tongue, song and speech, shall act in concert in the praise of God.
תּרנּנּה with Dagesh also in the second Nun, after the form תּקוננּה,
תּשׁכּנּה, side by side with which we also find the reading תּרנּנּה,
and the reading תּרנּנה, which is in itself admissible, after the form
תּאמנה, תּעגנה, but is here unattested.

(Note: Heidenheim reads תּרנּנּה with Segol, following the statement of
Ibn-Bil'am in his טעמי המקרא and of Mose ha-Nakdan in his דרכי הנקוד,
that Segol always precedes the ending נּה, with the exception only of
הנּה and האזנּה. Baer, on the other hand, reads תונּנּה, following
Aben-Ezra and Kimchi (Michlol 66b).)

The cohortative after כּי (lxx ὅταν) is intended to convey this meaning:
when I feel myself impelled to harp unto Thee. In the perfects in the
closing line that which is hoped for stands before his soul as though it
had already taken place. כי is repeated with triumphant emphasis.
