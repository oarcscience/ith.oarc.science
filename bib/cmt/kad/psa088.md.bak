Plaintive Prayer of a Patient Sufferer Like Job

Psalms 88 is as gloomy as [Psa 87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md)
is cheerful; they stand near one another as contrasts. Not Ps 77, as the
old expositors answer to the question quaenam ode omnium tristissima,
but this Psalms 88 is the darkest, gloomiest, of all the plaintive
Psalms; for it is true the name "God of my salvation," with which the
praying one calls upon God, and his praying itself, show that the spark
of faith within him is not utterly extinguished; but as to the rest, it
is all one pouring forth of deep lament in the midst of the severest
conflict of temptation in the presence of death, the gloom of melancholy
does not brighten up to become a hope, the Psalm dies away in Job-like
lamentation. Herein we discern echoes of the Korahitic [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) and of Davidic Psalms: compare
[Psa 88:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#003.md) with [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md); [Psa
88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005.md) with [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md); [Psa
88:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#006.md) with [Psa
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md); [Psa
88:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#018.md) with [Psa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017.md).; v. 19 (although differently
applied) with [Psa 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012.md); and more
particularly the questions in [Psa
88:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md) with [Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md), of which they are as it were only
the amplification. But these Psalm-echoes are outweighed by the still
more striking points of contact with the Book of Job, both as regards
linguistic usage (דּאב, [Psa 88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md),
[Job 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014.md); רפאים, [Psa
88:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md), [Job
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005.md); אבדּון, [Psa
88:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#012.md), [Job
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006.md); [Job
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#022.md); נער, [Psa
88:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#016.md), [Job
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#025.md); [Job
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#014.md); אמים, [Psa
88:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#016.md), [Job
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#025.md); בּעוּתים, [Psa
88:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#017.md), [Job
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004).md) and single thoughts (cf. [Psa
88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005.md) with [Job
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#010.md); [Psa
88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009.md) with [Job
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010.md); v. 19 with [Job
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#009.md); [Job
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#014).md), and also the suffering
condition of the poet and the whole manner in which this finds
expression. For the poet finds himself in the midst of the same
temptation as Job not merely so far as his mind and spirit are
concerned; but his outward affliction is, according to the tenor of his
complaints, the same, viz., the leprosy ([Psa
88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009).md), which, the disposition to which
being born with him, has been his inheritance from his youth up ([Psa
88:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#016).md). Now, since the Book of Job is
a Chokma-work of the Salomonic age, and the two Ezrahites belonged to
the wise men of the first rank at the court of Solomon ([Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031).md), it is natural to suppose that
the Book of Job has sprung out of this very Chokma-company, and that
perhaps this very Heman the Ezrahite who is the author of Psalms 88 has
made a passage of his own life, suffering, and conflict of soul, a
subject of dramatic treatment.

The inscription of the Psalm runs: A Psalm-song by the Korahites; to the
Precentor, to be recited (lit., to be pressed down, not after [Isa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002.md) : to be sung, which expresses
nothing, nor: to be sung alternatingly, which is contrary to the
character of the Psalm) after a sad manner (cf. [Psa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001).md) with muffled voice, a meditation
by Heman the Ezrahite. This is a double inscription, the two halves of
which are contradictory. The bare להימן side by side with לבני־קרח would
be perfectly in order, since the precentor Heman is a Korahite according
to [Ch1 6:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md); but חימן האזרחי is
the name of one of the four great Israelitish sages in [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md), who, according to [Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md), is a direct descendant of Zerah,
and therefore is not of the tribe of Levi, but of Judah. The
suppositions that Heman the Korahite had been adopted into the family of
Zerah, or that Heman the Ezrahite had been admitted among the Levites,
are miserable attempts to get over the difficulty. At the head of the
Psalm there stand two different statements respecting its origin side by
side, which are irreconcilable. The assumption that the title of the
Psalm originally was either merely שׁיר מזמור לבני־קרח, or merely למנצח
וגו, is warranted by the fact that only in this one Psalm למנצח does not
occupy the first place in the inscriptions. But which of the two
statements is the more reliable one? Most assuredly the latter; for שׁיר
מזמור לבני־קרח is only a recurrent repetition of the inscription of [Psa
87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md). The second statement, on the
other hand, by its precise designation of the melody, and by the
designation of the author, which corresponds to the Psalm that follows,
gives evidence of its antiquity and its historical character.

[Psalms 88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 88:1</span></span>

The poet finds himself in the midst of circumstances gloomy in the
extreme, but he does not despair; he still turns towards Jahve with his
complaints, and calls Him the God of his salvation. This actus directus
of fleeing in prayer to the God of salvation, which urges its way
through all that is dark and gloomy, is the fundamental characteristic
of all true faith. [Psa 88:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#002.md) is not to
be rendered, as a clause of itself: "by day I cry unto Thee, in the
night before Thee" (lxx and Targum), which ought to have been יומם, but
(as it is also pointed, especially in Baer's text): by day, i.e., in the
time ([Psa 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md); [Psa
78:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#042.md), cf. [Psa
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001).md), when I cry before Thee in the
night, let my prayer come... (Hitzig). In [Psa
88:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#003.md) he calls his piercing
lamentation, his wailing supplication, רנּתי, as in [Psa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md); [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md). הטּה as in [Psa
86:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001.md), for which we find הט in [Psa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md). The Beth of בּרעות, as in [Psa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005.md); [Lam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#015.md), [Lam
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#030.md), denotes that of which his soul
has already had abundantly sufficient. On [Psa
88:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#004.md), cf. as to the syntax [Psa
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011.md). איל (ἅπαξ λεγομ. like אילוּת,
[Psa 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020).md) signifies succinctness,
compactness, vigorousness (ἁδρότης): he is like a man from whom all
vital freshness and vigour is gone, therefore now only like the shadow
of a man, in fact like one already dead. חפשׁי, in [Psa
88:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#006.md), the lxx renders ἐν νεκροῖς
ἐλεύθερος (Symmachus, ἀφεὶς ἐλεύθερος); and in like manner the Targum,
and the Talmud which follows it in formulating the proposition that a
deceased person is חפשׁי מן חמצוות, free from the fulfilling of the
precepts of the Law (cf. [Rom 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#007).md).
Hitzig, Ewald, Kster, and Bttcher, on the contrary, explain it according
to [Eze 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#020.md) (where חפשׁ signifies
stragulum): among the dead is my couch (חפשׁי = יצועי, [Job
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#013).md). But in respect of [Job
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#019.md) the adjectival rendering is the
more probable; "one set free among the dead" (lxx) is equivalent to one
released from the bond of life ([Job
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005).md), somewhat as in Latin a dead
person is called defunctus. God does not remember the dead, i.e.,
practically, inasmuch as, devoid of any progressive history, their
condition remains always the same; they are in fact cut away (נגזר as in
[Psa 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md); [Lam
3:54](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#054.md); [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008).md) from the hand, viz., from the
guiding and helping hand, of God. Their dwelling-place is the pit of the
places lying deep beneath (cf. on תּחתּיּות, [Psa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010.md); [Psa
86:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#013.md); [Eze
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020.md), and more particularly [Lam
3:55](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#055).md), the dark regions (מחשׁכּים as
in [Psa 143:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#003.md), [Lam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#006).md), the submarine depths (בּמצלות;
lxx, Symmachus, the Syriac, etc.: ἐν σκιᾷ θανάτου = בצלמות, according to
[Job 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md) and frequently, but
contrary to [Lam 3:54](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#054).md), whose open
abyss is the grave for each one. On [Psa
88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008.md) cf. [Psa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md). The Mugrash by כל־משׁבריך stamps
it as an adverbial accusative (Targum), or more correctly, since the
expression is not עניתני, as the object placed in advance. Only those
who are not conversant with the subject (as Hupfeld in this instance)
imagine that the accentuation marks ענּית as a relative clause (cf. on
the contrary [Psa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#007.md), [Psa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003), etc..md). ענּה, to bow down, press
down; here used of the turning or directing downwards (lxx ἐπήγαγες) of
the waves, which burst like a cataract over the afflicted one.

[Psalms 88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 88:8</span></span>

The octastichs are now followed by hexastichs which belong together in
pairs. The complaint concerning the alienation of his nearest relations
sounds like [Job 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#013.md)., but the same
strain is also frequently heard in the earlier Psalms written in times
of suffering, e.g., [Psa 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009.md). He is
forsaken by all his familiar friends (not: acquaintances, for מידּע
signifies more than that), he is alone in the dungeon of wretchedness,
where no one comes near him, and whence he cannot make his escape. This
sounds, according to Lev. 13, very much like the complaint of a leper.
The Book of Leviticus there passes over from the uncleanness attending
the beginning of human life to the uncleanness of the most terrible
disease. Disease is the middle stage between birth and death, and,
according to the Eastern notion, leprosy is the worst of all diseases,
it is death itself clinging to the still living man ([Num
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#012).md), and more than all other evils
a stroke of the chastening hand of God (נגע), a scourge of God (צרעת).
The man suspected of having leprosy was to be subjected to a seven days'
quarantine until the determination of the priest's diagnosis; and if the
leprosy was confirmed, he was to dwell apart outside the camp ([Lev
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#046).md), where, though not imprisoned,
he was nevertheless separated from his dwelling and his family (cf. Job,
at [Job 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#019).md), and if a man of
position, would feel himself condemned to a state of involuntary
retirement. It is natural to refer the כּלא, which is closely connected
with שׁתּני, to this separation. עיני, [Psa
88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md), instead of עיני, as in [Psa
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md); [Psa
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010.md) : his eye has languished,
vanished away (דּאב of the same root as tābescere, cognate with the root
of דּונג, [Psa 68:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#003).md), in consequence
of (his) affliction. He calls and calls upon Jahve, stretches out
(שׁטּח, expandere, according to the Arabic, more especially after the
manner of a roof) his hands (palmas) towards Him, in order to shield
himself from His wrath and to lead Him compassionately to give ear to
him. In [Psa 88:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md) he bases his cry
for help upon a twofold wish, viz., to become an object of the
miraculous help of God, and to be able to praise Him for it. Neither of
these wishes would be realized if he were to die; for that which lies
beyond this life is uniform darkness, devoid of any progressive history.
With מתים alternates רפאים (sing. רפא), the relaxed ones, i.e., shades
(σκιαὶ) of the nether world. With reference to יודוּ instead of להודות,
vid., Ewald, 337, b. Beside חשׁך ([Job
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021)..md) stands ארץ נשׁיּה, the land of
forgetfulness (λήθη), where there is an end of all thinking, feeling,
and acting ([Ecc 9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005.md), [Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010).md), and where the monotony of
death, devoid of thought and recollection, reigns. Such is the
representation given in the Old Testament of the state beyond the
present, even in Ecclesiastes, and in the Apocrypha (Sir. 17:27f. after
[Isa 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018).; Baruch 2:17f..md); and it
was obliged to be thus represented, for in the New Testament not merely
the conception of the state after death, but this state itself, is
become a different one.

[Psalms 88:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 88:13</span></span>

He who complains thus without knowing any comfort, and yet without
despairing, gathers himself up afresh for prayer. With ואני he contrasts
himself with the dead who are separated from God's manifestation of
love. Being still in life, although under wrath that apparently has no
end, he strains every nerve to struggle through in prayer until he shall
reach God's love. His complaints are petitions, for they are complaints
that are poured forth before God. The destiny under which for a long
time he has been more like one dying than living, reaches back even into
his youth. מנּער (since נער is everywhere undeclined) is equivalent to
מנּערי. The ἐξηπορήθην of the lxx is the right indicator for the
understanding of the ἅπαξ λ.ε.γ. אפוּנה. Aben-Ezra and Kimchi derive it
from פּן, like עלה from על,

(Note: The derivation is not contrary to the genius of the language; the
supplementing productive force of the language displayed in the
liturgical poetry of the synagogue, also changes particles into verbs:
vid., Zunz, Die synagogaie Poesie des Mittelalters, S. 421.)

and assign to it the signification of dubitare. But it may be more
safely explained after the Arabic words Arab. afana, afina, ma'fûn (root
'f, to urge forwards, push), in which the fundamental notion of driving
back, narrowing and exhausting, is transferred to a weakening or
weakness of the intellect. We might also compare פּנה, Arab. faniya, "to
disappear, vanish, pass away;" but the ἐξηπορήθην of the lxx favours the
kinship with that Arab. afina, infirma mente et consilii inops fuit,

(Note: Abulwald also explains אפוּנה after the Arabic, but in a way that
cannot be accepted, viz., "for a long time onwards," from the Arabic
iffân (ibbân, iff, afaf, ifâf, taiffah), time, period - time conceived
of in the onward rush, the constant succession of its moments.)

which has been already compared by Castell. The aorist of the lxx,
however, is just as erroneous in this instance as in [Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md); [Psa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#003.md); [Psa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005.md). In all these instances the
cohortative denotes the inward result following from an outward
compulsion, as they say in Hebrew: I lay hold of trembling ([Isa
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008.md); [Job
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#020.md); [Job
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#006).md) or joy ([Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md); [Isa
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011).md), when the force of
circumstances drive one into such states of mind. Labouring under the
burden of divine dispensations of a terrifying character, he finds
himself in a state of mental weakness and exhaustion, or of insensible
(senseless) fright; over him as their destined goal before many others
go God's burnings of wrath (plur. only in this instance), His terrible
decrees (vid., concerning בעת on [Psa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005).md) have almost annihilated him.
צמּתתוּני is not an impossible form (Olshausen, 251, a), but an
intensive form of צמּתוּ, the last part of the already inflected verb
being repeated, as in עהבוּ הבוּ, [Hos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md) (cf. in the department of the
noun, פּיפיּות, edge-edges = many edges, [Psa
149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006).md), perhaps under the influence of
the derivative.

(Note: Heidenheim interprets: Thy terrors are become to me as צמתת ([Lev
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023)), i.e., inalienably my own..md)

The corrections צמתּתני (from צמתת) or צמּתתני (from צמּת) are simple
enough; but it is more prudent to let tradition judge of that which is
possible in the usage of the language. In [Psa
88:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#018.md) the burnings become floods; the
wrath of God can be compared to every destroying and overthrowing
element. The billows threaten to swallow him up, without any helping
hand being stretched out to him on the part of any of his lovers and
friends. In v. 19a to be now explained according to [Job
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#014.md), viz., My familiar friends are
gloomy darkness; i.e., instead of those who were hitherto my familiars
([Job 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#014).md), darkness is become my
familiar friend? One would have thought that it ought then to have been
מידּעי (Schnurrer), or, according to [Pro
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#004.md), מודעי, and that, in connection
with this sense of the noun, מחשׁך ought as subject to have the
precedence, that consequently מידּעי is subject and מחשׁך predicate: my
familiar friends have lost themselves in darkness, are become absolutely
invisible (Hitzig at last). But the regular position of the words is
kept to if it is interpreted: my familiar friends are reduced to gloomy
darkness as my familiar friend, and the plural is justified by [Job
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#014) : Mother and sister (do I call.md)
the worm. With this complaint the harp falls from the poet's hands. He
is silent, and waits on God, that He may solve this riddle of
affliction. From the Book of Job we might infer that He also actually
appeared to him. He is more faithful than men. No soul that in the midst
of wrath lays hold upon His love, whether with a firm or with a
trembling hand, is suffered to be lost.
