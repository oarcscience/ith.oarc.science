### [Genesis Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 23:1</span></span>

Sarah is the only woman whose age is mentioned in the Scriptures,
because as the mother of the promised seed she became the mother of all
believers ([Pe1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006).md). She died at the
age of 127, thirty-seven years after the birth of Isaac, at Hebron, or
rather in the grove of Mamre near that city ([Gen
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#018).md), whither Abraham had once more
returned after a lengthened stay at Beersheba ([Gen
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#019).md). The name Kirjath Arba, i.e.,
the city of Arba, which Hebron bears here and also in [Gen
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#027.md), and other passages, and which
it still bore at the time of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites
([Jos 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015).md), was not the original
name of the city, but was first given to it by Arba the Anakite and his
family, who had not yet arrived there in the time of the patriarchs. It
was probably given by them when they took possession of the city, and
remained until the Israelites captured it and restored the original
name. The place still exists, as a small town on the road from Jerusalem
to Beersheba, in a valley surrounded by several mountains, and is called
by the Arabs, with allusion to Abraham's stay there, el Khalil, i.e.,
the friend (of God), which is the title given to Abraham by the
Mohammedans. The clause "in the land of Canaan" denotes, that not only
did Sarah die in the land of promise, but Abraham as a foreigner
acquired a burial-place by purchase there. "And Abraham came" (not from
Beersheba, but from the field where he may have been with the flocks),
"to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her," i.e., to arrange for the
customary mourning ceremony.

[Genesis 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 23:3</span></span>

He then went to the Hittites, the lords and possessors of the city and
its vicinity at that time, to procure from them "a possession of a
burying-place." The negotiations were carried on in the most formal
style, in a public assembly "of the people of the land," i.e., of
natives ([Gen 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#007).md), in the gate of
the city ([Gen 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010).md). As a foreigner
and sojourner, Abraham presented his request in the most courteous
manner to all the citizens ("all that went in at the gate," [Gen
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010.md), [Gen
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#018.md); a phrase interchangeable with
"all that went out at the gate," [Gen
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#024.md), and those who "go out and in,"
[Jer 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019).md). The citizens with the
greatest readiness and respect offered "the prince of God," i.e., the
man exalted by God to the rank of a prince, "the choice" (מבחר, i.e.,
the most select) of their graves for his use ([Gen
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#006).md). But Abraham asked them to
request Ephron, who, to judge from the expression "his city" in [Gen
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010.md), was then ruler of the city, to
give him for a possession the cave of Machpelah, at the end of his
field, of which he was the owner, "for full silver," i.e., for its full
worth. Ephron thereupon offered to make him a present of both field and
cave. This was a turn in the affair which is still customary in the
East; the design, so far as it is seriously meant at all, being either
to obtain a present in return which will abundantly compensate for the
value of the gift, or, what is still more frequently the case, to
preclude any abatement in the price to be asked. The same design is
evident in the peculiar form in which Ephron stated the price, in reply
to Abraham's repeated declaration that he was determined to buy the
piece of land: "a piece of land of 400 shekels of silver, what is that
between me and thee" ([Gen 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015).md)?
Abraham understood it so (ישׁמע [Gen
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016).md), and weighed him the price
demanded. The shekel of silver "current with the merchant," i.e., the
shekel which passed in trade as of standard weight, was 274 Parisian
grains, so that the price of the piece of land was 52, 10s.; a very
considerable amount for that time.

[Genesis 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 23:17</span></span>

"Thus arose (ויּקם) the field...to Abraham for a possession;" i.e., it
was conveyed to him in all due legal form. The expression "the field of
Ephron which is at Machpelah" may be explained, according to [Gen
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#009.md), from the fact that the cave of
Machpelah was at the end of the field, the field, therefore, belonged to
it. In [Gen 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#019.md) the shorter form,
"cave of Machpelah," occurs; and in [Gen
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#020.md) the field is distinguished from
the cave. The name Machpelah is translated by the lxx as a common noun,
τὸ σπήλαιον τὸ διπλοῦν, from מכפּלה doubling; but it had evidently grown
into a proper name, since it is sued not only of the cave, but of the
adjoining field also ([Gen 49:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#030.md); [Gen
50:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#013).md), though it undoubtedly
originated in the form of the cave. The cave was before, i.e., probably
to the east of, the grove of Mamre, which was in the district of Hebron.
This description cannot be reconciled with the tradition, which
identifies Mamre and the cave with Ramet el Khalil, where the strong
foundation-walls of an ancient heathen temple (according to Rosenmller's
conjecture, an Idumaean one) are still pointed out as Abraham's house,
and where a very old terebinth stood in the early Christian times; for
this is an hour's journey to the north of modern Hebron, and even the
ancient Hebron cannot have stretched so far over the mountains which
separate the modern city from Rameh, but must also, according to [Gen
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#014.md), have been situated in the
valley (see Robinson's later Biblical Researches, pp. 365ff.). There is
far greater probability in the Mohammedan tradition, that the Harem,
built of colossal blocks with grooved edges, which stands on the western
slope of the Beabireh mountain, in the north-western portion of the
present town, contains hidden within it the cave of Machpelah with the
tomb of the patriarchs (cf. Robinson, Pal. ii. 435ff.); and Rosen. is
induced to look for Mamre on the eastern slope of the Rumeidi hill, near
to the remarkable well Ain el Jedid.

[Genesis 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 23:20</span></span>

The repetition of the statement, that the field with the cave in it was
conveyed to Abraham by the Hittites for a burial-place, which gives the
result of the negotiation that has been described with, so to speak,
legal accuracy, shows the great importance of the event to the
patriarch. The fact that Abraham purchased a burying-place in strictly
legal form as an hereditary possession in the promised land, was a proof
of his strong faith in the promises of God and their eventual
fulfilment. In this grave Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, were
buried; there Jacob buried Leah; and there Jacob himself requested that
he might be buried, thus declaring his faith in the promises, even in
the hour of his death.
