Isaac's Joys and Sorrows - Genesis 26

The incidents of Isaac's life which are collected together in this
chapter, from the time of his sojourn in the south country, resemble in
many respects certain events in the life of Abraham; but the distinctive
peculiarities are such as to form a true picture of the dealings of God,
which were in perfect accordance with the character of the patriarch.

[Genesis 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 26:1</span></span>

Renewal of the Promise. - A famine "in the land" (i.e., Canaan, to which
he had therefore returned from Hagar's well; [Gen
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#011).md), compelled Isaac to leave
Canaan, as it had done Abraham before. Abraham went to Egypt, where his
wife was exposed to danger, from which she could only be rescued by the
direct interposition of God. Isaac also intended to go there, but on the
way, viz., in Gerar, he received instruction through a divine
manifestation that he was to remain there. As he was the seed to whom
the land of Canaan was promised, he was directed not to leave it. To
this end Jehovah assured him of the fulfilment of all the promises made
to Abraham on oath, with express reference to His oath ([Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016).md) to him and to his posterity,
and on account of Abraham's obedience of faith. The only peculiarity in
the words is the plural, "all these lands." This plural refers to all
the lands or territories of the different Canaanitish tribes, mentioned
in [Gen 15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019.md), like the different
divisions of the kingdom of Israel or Judah in [Ch1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#002.md); [Ch2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023.md). האל; an antique form of האלּה
occurring only in the Pentateuch. The piety of Abraham is described in
words that indicate a perfect obedience to all the commands of God, and
therefore frequently recur among the legal expressions of a later date.
יהוה משׁמרת שׁמר "to take care of Jehovah's care," i.e., to observe
Jehovah, His persons, and His will, Mishmereth, reverence, observance,
care, is more closely defined by "commandments, statutes, laws," to
denote constant obedience to all the revelations and instructions of
God.

[Genesis 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 26:6</span></span>

Protection of Rebekah at Gerar. - As Abraham had declared his wife to be
his sister both in Egypt and at Gerar, so did Isaac also in the latter
place. But the manner in which God protected Rebekah was very different
from that in which Sarah was preserved in both instances. Before any one
had touched Rebekah, the Philistine king discovered the untruthfulness
of Isaac's statement, having seen Isaac "sporting with Rebekah," sc., in
a manner to show that she was his wife; whereupon he reproved Isaac for
what he had said, and forbade any of his people to touch Rebekah on pain
of death. Whether this was the same Abimelech as the one mentioned in
Gen 20 cannot be decided with certainty. The name proves nothing, for it
was the standing official name of the kings of Gerar (cf. [Sa1
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#011) and Ps 34.md), as Pharaoh was of
the kings of Egypt. The identity is favoured by the pious conduct of
Abimelech in both instances; and no difficulty is caused either by the
circumstance that 80 years had elapsed between the two events (for
Abraham had only been dead five years, and the age of 150 was no rarity
then), or by the fact, that whereas the first Abimelech had Sarah taken
into his harem, the second not only had no intention of doing this, but
was anxious to protect her from his people, inasmuch as it would be all
the easier to conceive of this in the case of the same king, on the
ground of his advanced age.

[Genesis 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 26:12</span></span>

Isaac's Increasing Wealth. - As Isaac had experienced the promised
protection ("I will be with thee," [Gen
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#003).md) in the safety of his wife, so
did he received while in Gerar the promised blessing. He sowed and
received in that year "a hundred measures," i.e., a hundred-fold return.
This was an unusual blessing, as the yield even in very fertile regions
is not generally greater than from twenty-five to fifty-fold (Niebuhr
and Burckhardt), and it is only in the Ruhbe, that small and most
fruitful plain of Syria, that wheat yields on an average eighty, and
barley a hundred-fold. Agriculture is still practised by the Bedouins,
as well as grazing (Robinson, Pal. i. 77, and Seetzen); so that Isaac's
sowing was no proof that he had been stimulated by the promise of
Jehovah to take up a settled abode in the promised land.

[Gen 26:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#013.md)

Being thus blessed of Jehovah, Isaac became increasingly (הלוך, vid.,
[Gen 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#003)) greater (i.e., stronger.md),
until he was very powerful and his wealth very great; so that the
Philistines envied him, and endeavoured to do him injury by stopping up
and filling with rubbish all the wells that had been dug in his father's
time; and even Abimelech requested him to depart, because he was afraid
of his power. Isaac then encamped in the valley of Gerar, i.e., in the
"undulating land of Gerar," through which the torrent (Jurf) from Gerar
flows from the south-east (Ritter, Erdk. 14, pp. 1084-5).

[Genesis 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 26:18</span></span>

Reopening and Discovery of Wells. - In this valley Isaac dug open the
old wells which had existed from Abraham's time, and gave them the old
names. His people also dug three new wells. But Abimelech's people
raised a contest about two of these; and for this reason Isaac called
them Esek and Sitnah, strife and opposition. The third there was no
dispute about; and it received in consequence the name Rehoboth,
"breadths," for Isaac said, "Yea now (כּי־עתּה, as in [Gen
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#032), etc..md) Jehovah has provided for
us a broad space, that we may be fruitful (multiply) in the land." This
well was probably not in the land of Gerar, as Isaac had removed thence,
but in the Wady Ruhaibeh, the name of which is suggestive of Rehoboth,
which stands at the point where the two roads from Gaza and Hebron meet,
about 3 hours to the south of Elusa, 8 1/3 to the south of Beersheba,
and where there are extensive ruins of the city of the same name upon
the heights, also the remains of wells (Robinson, Pal. i. 289ff.;
Strauss, Sinai and Golgotha); where too the name Sitnah seems to have
been retained in the Wady Shutein, with ruins on the northern hills
between Ruhaibeh and Khulasa (Elusa).

[Genesis 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 26:23</span></span>

Isaac's Journey to Beersheba. - Here, where Abraham had spent a long
time ([Gen 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033)..md), Jehovah appeared
to him during the night and renewed the promises already given; upon
which, Isaac built an altar and performed a solemn service. Here his
servants also dug a well near to the tents.

[Genesis 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 26:26</span></span>

Abimelech's Treaty with Isaac. - The conclusion of this alliance was
substantially only a repetition of renewal of the alliance entered into
with Abraham; but the renewal itself arose so completely out of the
circumstances, that there is no ground whatever for denying that it
occurred, or for the hypothesis that our account is merely another form
of the earlier alliance; to say nothing of the fact, that besides the
agreement in the leading event itself, the attendant circumstances are
altogether peculiar, and correspond to the events which preceded.
Abimelech not only brought his chief captain Phicol (supposed to be the
same as in [Gen 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022.md), if Phicol is
not also an official name), but his מרע "friend," i.e., his privy
councillor, Ahuzzath. Isaac referred to the hostility they had shown; to
which Abimelech replied, that they (he and his people) did not smite him
(נגע), i.e., drive him away by force, but let him depart in peace, and
expressed a wish that there might be an oath between them. אלה the oath,
as an act of self-imprecation, was to form the basis of the covenant to
be made. From this אלה came also to be used for a covenant sanctioned by
an oath ([Deu 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#011.md), [Deu
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#013).md). תּעשׂה אם "that thou do not:"
אם a particle of negation used in an oath ([Gen
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#023), etc..md). (On the verb with zere,
see Ges. 75, Anm. 17; Ewald, 224.) - The same day Isaac's servants
informed him of the well which they had dug; and Isaac gave it the name
Shebah (שׁבעה, oath), in commemoration of the treaty made on oath.
"Therefore the city was called Beersheba." This derivation of the name
does not shut the other ([Gen 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031).md)
out, but seems to confirm it. As the treaty made on oath between
Abimelech and Isaac was only a renewal of his covenant concluded before
with Abraham, so the name Beersheba was also renewed by the well Shebah.
The reality of the occurrence is supported by the fact that the two
wells are in existence still (vid., [Gen
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031).md).

[Genesis 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 26:34</span></span>

Esau's Marriage. - To the various troubles which the Philistines
prepared for Isaac, but which, through the blessing of God, only
contributed to the increase of his wealth and importance, a domestic
cross was added, which caused him great and lasting sorrow. Esau married
two wives in the 40th year of his age, the 100th of Isaac's life ([Gen
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#026).md); and that not from his own
relations in Mesopotamia, but from among the Canaanites whom God had
cast off. On their names, see [Gen
34:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002.md). They became "bitterness of
spirit," the cause of deep trouble, to his parents, viz., on account of
their Canaanitish character, which was so opposed to the vocation of the
patriarchs; whilst Esau by these marriages furnished another proof, how
thoroughly his heart was set upon earthly things.
