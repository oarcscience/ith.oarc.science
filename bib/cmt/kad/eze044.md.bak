### [Ezekiel Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001.md)

Position of the Different Classes of the People in Relation to the New
Sanctuary

With the consecration of the altar of burnt-offering the way is opened
for the congregation of Israel to appear in the sanctuary before the
Lord, to serve Him with sacrifices. If, however, the use of the new
house of God was to be in harmony with the holiness of the God who dwelt
therein, it was requisite that still further directions should be given
concerning the entering of the people into it, and the character of the
servants of both the altar and the sanctuary. These directions follow in
the chapter before us-first, as to the place which the prince was to
occupy at the service in the temple ([Eze
44:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001).md); secondly, as to the admission
of foreigners and the appointment of Levites and priests for the service
([Eze 44:4-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#004).md); and lastly, as to the
conditions requisite for the administration of the priest's office, and
the duties and privileges of that office ([Eze
44:17-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#017).md).

[Ezekiel 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 44:1</span></span>

The Place of the Prince in the Sanctuary. - [Eze
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001.md). And he brought me back by the
way to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looked toward the east;
and it was shut. [Eze 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002.md). And
Jehovah said to me, This gate shall be shut, shall not be opened, and no
one shall enter thereby; because Jehovah, the God of Israel, has entered
by it, it shall be shut. [Eze 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#003.md). As
for the prince, as prince he shall sit therein, to eat bread before
Jehovah; from the way to the porch of the gate shall he go in, and from
its way shall he go out. - From the inner court where Ezekiel had
received the measurements of the altar of burnt-offering and the
instructions concerning its consecration ([Eze
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#005)..md), he is taken back to the east
gate of the outer court, and finds this gate, which formed the principle
entrance to the temple, closed. Jehovah explains this fact to him
through the angel (ויּאמר is to be understood according to [Eze
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#006.md) and [Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007).md) thus: "this gate is to be shut,
because Jehovah, the God of Israel, has entered into the temple
thereby," as we have already learned from [Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002.md). Only the prince, as prince, was
allowed to sit in it for the purpose of holding sacrificial meals there.
So far the meaning of the words is clear and indisputable. For there can
be no doubt whatever that [Eze 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#003.md)
introduces a more precise statement concerning the closing of the gate;
in other words, that the right of sitting in the gate to eat bread
before Jehovah, which is conceded to the priest, is intended as an
explanation, resp. modification and limitation, of the statement והיה
([Eze 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002).md). On the other hand, the
more precise definition of the prerogative granted to the prince in [Eze
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#003.md) is not quite clear, and therefore
open to dispute. Such a prerogative is already indicated in the
prominence expressly given to the prince, consisting partly in the fact
that את־הנּשׂיא is written first in an absolute form, and partly in the
expression נשׂיא הוּא, which is repeated in the form of a circumstantial
clause, "prince is he," equivalent to "because he is prince, he is to
sit there." נשׂיא is neither the high priest, as many of the older
commentators supposed, nor a collective term for the civil authorities
of the people of Israel in the Messianic times (Hvernick), but the David
who will be prince in Israel at that time, according to [Eze
34:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md), and [Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md). "To eat bread before Jehovah"
signifies to hold a sacrificial meal at the place of the divine
presence, i.e., in the temple court, and is not to be restricted, as
Kliefoth supposes, to that sacrificial meal "which was held after and
along with the bloodless sacrifices, viz., the minchoth, and the
shew-breads, and the sweet loaves of the Passover." There is no
authority in the usage of the language for this literal interpretation
of the expression "to eat bread," for אכל לחם means in general to
partake of a meal, compare [Gen 31:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#054.md),
etc., and especially [Exo 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#012.md), where
Jethro "eats bread before God" with Aaron and the elders of Israel, that
is to say, joins in a sacrificial meal composed of זבחים or
slain-offerings. According to this view, which is the only one supported
by usage, the prerogative secured to the נשׂיא of the future is not
"that of participating in the sacrificial meals (of the priests), which
were to be held daily with the minchoth and shew-bread, in opposition to
the law which prevailed before" (Kliefoth), but simply that of holding
his sacrificial meals in the gate, i.e., in the porch of the gate,
whereas the people were only allowed to hold them in the court, namely,
in the vicinity of the sacrificial kitchens.

There is also a difference of opinion concerning the meaning of the
second statement in [Eze 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#003.md) : "from
the way of the porch of the gate shall he enter in, and thence shall he
go out." The suffix in מדּרכּו can only refer to אוּלם, "from the way
from which he came (entered), from this way shall he go out again."
Hitzig follows the Rabbins, who understand the passage thus: "as the
gate is to remain shut, he must go by the way to the porch which is
directed inwardly, toward the court ([Eze
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#009).md). He must have gone into the
outer court through the north or the south gate, and by the way by which
he came he also went back again." But Kliefoth argues, in objection to
this, that "if the prince was to eat the bread in the porch, the
entrance through the south or the north gate would be of no use to him
at all; as the gate which could be shut was at that door of the porch
which was turned toward the outer court." Moreover, he affirms that it
is not at all the meaning of the text that he was to eat the bread in
the porch, but that he was to eat it in the gate-building, and he was to
come thither מדּרך אוּלם השּׁער, i.e., "from the place which served as a
way to the gate porch, that is to say, the walk from the eastern
entrance of the gate-building to the front of the porch, and from that
was he to go out again." The prince, therefore, was "to go into the
gate-building as far as the front of the porch through the eastern
entrance, there to eat his bread before Jehovah, and to come out again
from thence, so that the gate at the western side of the gate porch
still remained shut." But we cannot regard either of these views as
correct. There is no firm foundation in the text for Kliefoth's
assertion, that he was not to eat the bread in the porch, but in the
gate-building. It is true that the porch is not expressly mentioned as
the place where the eating was to take place, but simply the gate (בּו);
yet the porch belonged to the gate as an integral part of the
gate-building; and if דּרך אוּלם is the way to the porch, or the way
leading to the porch, the words, "by the way to the porch shall he enter
in," imply clearly enough that he was to go into the porch and to eat
bread there. This is also demanded by the circumstance, as the meaning
of the words cannot possibly be that the prince was to hold his
sacrificial meal upon the threshold of the gate, or in one of the
guard-rooms, or in the middle of the gateway; and apart from the porch,
there were no other places in the gate-building than those we have
named. And again, the statement that the gate on the western side of the
gate porch was to be shut, and not that against the eastern wall, is
also destitute of proof, as דּרך אוּלם, the way to the porch, is not
equivalent to the way "up to the front of the porch." And if the prince
was to hold the sacrificial meal behind the inner gate, which was
closed, how was the food when it was prepared to be carried into the
gate-building? Through a door of one of the guard-rooms? Such a
supposition is hardly reconcilable with the significance of a holy
sacrificial meal. In fact, it is a question whether eating in the
gate-building with the inner door closed, so that it was not even
possible to look toward the sanctuary, in which Jehovah was enthroned,
could be called eating לפני.

Hitzig's explanation of the words is not exposed to any of these
difficulties, but it is beset by others. At the outset it is chargeable
with improbability, as it is impossible to see any just ground why the
prince, if he was to hold the sacrificial meal in the porch of the east
gate, should not have been allowed to enter through this gate, but was
obliged to take the circuitous route through the south or the north
gate. Again, it is irreconcilable with the analogous statements in
Ezekiel 46. According to [Eze 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#001.md).,
the east gate of the inner court was to be shut, namely, during the six
working days; but on the Sabbath and on the new moon it was to be
opened. Then the prince was to come by the way of the gate porch from
without, and during the preparation of his sacrifice by the priests to
stand upon the threshold of the gate and worship. This same thing was to
take place when the prince desired to offer a freewill offering on any
of the week-days. The east gate was to be opened for him to this end;
but after the conclusion of the offering of sacrifice it was to be
closed again, whereas on the Sabbaths and new moons it was to stand open
till the evening ([Eze 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#012.md) compared
with [Eze 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002).md). It is still further
enjoined, that when offering these sacrifices the prince is to enter by
the way of the gate porch, and to go out again by the same way ([Eze
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002.md) and [Eze
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#008).md); whereas on the feast days, on
which the people appear before Jehovah, every one who comes, the priest
along with the rest, is to go in and out through the north or the south
gate ([Eze 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#009.md) and [Eze
44:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#010).md). If, therefore, on the feast
days, when the people appeared before Jehovah, the prince was to go into
the temple in the midst of the people through the north or the south
gate to worship, whereas on the Sabbaths and new moons, on which the
people were not required to appear before the Lord, so that the prince
alone had to bring the offerings for himself and the people, he was to
enter by the way of the porch of the east gate, and to go out again by
the same, and during the ceremony of offering the sacrifice was to stand
upon the threshold of the inner east gate, it is obvious that the going
in and out by the way of the porch of the gate was to take place by a
different way from that through the north or the south gate. This other
way could only be through the east gate, as no fourth gate existed. -
The conclusion to which this brings us, so far as the passage before us
is concerned, is that the shutting of the east gate of the outer court
was to be the rule, but that there were certain exceptions which are not
fully explained till Ezekiel 46, though they are hinted at in the
chapter before us in the directions given there, that the prince was to
hold the sacrificial meal in this gate. - The outer east gate, which was
probably the one chiefly used by the people when appearing before the
Lord in the earlier temple, both for going in and coming out, is to be
shut in the new temple, and not to be made use of by the people for
either entrance or exit, because the glory of the Lord entered into the
temple thereby. This reason is of course not to be understood in the way
suggested by the Rabbins, namely, that the departure of the Shechinah
from the temple was to be prevented by the closing of the gate; but the
thought is this: because this gateway had been rendered holy through the
entrance of the Shechinah into the temple thereby, it was not to remain
open to the people, so as to be desecrated, but was to be kept
perpetually holy. This keeping holy was not prejudiced in any way by the
fact that the prince held the sacrificial meal in the gate, and also
entered the court through this gateway for the purpose of offering his
sacrifice, which was made ready by the priests before the inner gate,
and then was present at the offering of the sacrifice upon the altar,
standing upon the threshold of the inner gate-building. דּרך אוּלם is
therefore the way which led from the outer flight of steps across the
threshold past the guard-rooms to the gate porch at the inner end of the
gate-building. By this way the priest was to go into the gate opened for
him, and hold the sacrificial meal therein, namely, in the porch of this
gate. That the offering of the sacrifice necessarily preceded the meal
is assumed as self-evident, and the law of sacrifice in Ezekiel 46 first
prescribes the manner in which the prince was to behave when offering
the sacrifice, and how near to the altar he was to be allowed to go.

[Ezekiel 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 44:4</span></span>

The Position of Foreigners, Levites, and Priests in Relation to the
Temple and the Temple Service. - The further precepts concerning the
approach to the sanctuary, and the worship to be presented there, are
introduced with a fresh exhortation to observe with exactness all the
statutes and laws, in order that the desecration of the sanctuary which
had formerly taken place might not be repeated, and are delivered to the
prophet at the north gate in front of the manifestation of the glory of
God ([Eze 44:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#004).md). - [Eze
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#004.md). And he brought me by the way of
the north gate to the front of the house; and I looked, and behold the
glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah, and I fell down upon my
face. [Eze 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#005.md). And Jehovah said to
me, Son of man, direct thy heart and see with thine eyes and hear with
thine ears all that I say to thee with regard to all the statutes of the
house of Jehovah and all its laws, and direct thy heart to the entering
into the house through all the exits of the house, [Eze
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#006.md). And say to the rebellious one,
to the family of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Let it be
sufficient for you, of all your abominations, O house of Israel, [Eze
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#007.md). In that ye brought in
foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in
my sanctuary, to desecrate it, my house, when ye offered my food, fat
and blood, and so they broke my covenant to all your abominations, [Eze
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#008.md). And so ye did not keep the
charge of my holy things, but made them keepers of my charge for you in
my sanctuary. - From the outer gate to which Ezekiel had been taken,
simply that he might be instructed concerning the entering thereby, he
is once more conducted, after this has been done, by the way of the
north gate to the front of the temple house, to receive the further
directions there for the performance of the worship of God in the new
sanctuary. The question, whether we are to understand by the north gate
that of the outer or that of the inner court, cannot be answered with
certainty. Hitzig has decided in favour of the latter, Kliefoth in
favour of the former. The place to which he is conducted is אל־פּני
הבּית, ad faciem domus, before the temple house, so that he had it
before his eyes, i.e., was able to see it. As the gateway of the inner
court was eight steps, about four cubits, higher than the outer court
gate, this was hardly possible if he stood at or within the latter.
הבּית, i.e., the temple house, could only be distinctly seen from the
inner north gate. And the remark that it is more natural to think of the
outer north gate, because the next thing said to the prophet has
reference to the question who is to go into and out of the sanctuary,
has not much force, as the instructions do not refer to the going in and
out alone, but chiefly to the charge of Jehovah, i.e., to the
maintenance of divine worship.

At the fresh standing-place the glory of the Lord, which filled the
temple, met the sight of the prophet again, so that he fell down and
worshipped once more (cf. [Eze 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#003.md),
[Eze 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#005).md). This remark is not
intended "to indicate that now, after the preliminary observations in
Ezekiel 43:13-44:3, the true thorah commences" (Kliefoth), but to show
the unapproachable glory and holiness of the new temple. For [Eze
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#005.md), see [Eze
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#004.md); [Eze
43:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#011.md). In [Eze
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#006.md) אל־מרי is placed at the head in a
substantive form for the sake of emphasis, and בּית־ישׂראל is appended
in the form of an apposition. For the fact itself, see [Eze
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008.md). רב־לּכם followed by מן, a
sufficiency of anything, as in [Exo
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#028.md); [Kg1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md), is equivalent to "there is
enough for you to desist from it." The תּועבות, from which they are to
desist, are more precisely defined in [Eze
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#006.md). They consisted in the fact that
the Israelites admitted foreigners, heathen, uncircumcised in heart and
flesh, into the sanctuary, to desecrate it during the offering of
sacrifice. It is not expressly stated, indeed, that they admitted
uncircumcised heathen to the offering of sacrifice, but this is implied
in what is affirmed. The offering of sacrifice in the temple of Jehovah
is not only permitted in the Mosaic law to foreigners living in Israel,
but to some extent prescribed ([Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010.md),[Lev
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#012.md); [Num
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#013)..md). It was only in the paschal
meal that no 'בן was allowed to participate ([Exo
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#043).md). To do this, he must first of
all be circumcised (v. 44). Solomon accordingly prays to the Lord in his
temple-prayer that He will also hearken to the prayer of the foreigner,
who may come from a distant land for the Lord's name sake to worship in
His house ([Kg1 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#041)..md). The reproof in
the verse before us is apparently at variance with this. Raschi would
therefore understand by בּני־נכר, Israelites who had fallen into heathen
idolatry. Rosenmller, on the other hand, is of opinion that the
Israelites were blamed because they had accepted victimas et libamina
from the heathen, and offered them in the temple, which had been
prohibited in [Lev 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#022.md). Hvernick
understands by the sons of the foreigner, Levites who had become
apostates from Jehovah, and were therefore placed by Ezekiel on a par
with the idolatrous sons of the foreigner. And lastly, Hitzig imagines
that they were foreign traders, who had been admitted within the sacred
precincts as sellers of sacrificial animals, incense, and so forth. All
these are alike arbitrary and erroneous. The apparent discrepancy
vanishes, if we consider the more precise definition of בּני , viz.,
"uncircumcised in heart and flesh." Their being uncircumcised in heart
is placed first, for the purpose of characterizing the foreigners as
godless heathen, who ere destitute not only of the uncircumcision of
their flesh, but also of that of the heart, i.e., of piety of heart,
which Solomon mentions in his prayer as the motive for the coming of
distant strangers to the temple. By the admission of such foreigners as
these, who had no fear of God at all, into the temple during the
sacrificial worship, Israel had defiled the sanctuary. את־בּיתי is in
apposition to the suffix to חלּלו. The food of Jehovah (לחמי) is
sacrifice, according to [Lev 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#011.md);
[Lev 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#006.md), etc., and is therefore
explained by "fat and blood." ויּפרוּ, which the lxx changed in an
arbitrary manner into the second person, refers to the "foreigners," the
heathen. By their treading the temple in their ungodliness they broke
the covenant of the Lord with His people, who allowed this desecration
of His sanctuary. אל כּל־תּועבות, in addition to all your abominations.
How grievous a sin was involved in this is stated in [Eze
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#008.md). The people of Israel, by their
unrighteous admission of godless heathen into the temple, not only
failed to show the proper reverence for the holy things of the Lord, but
even made these heathen, so to speak, servants of God for themselves in
His sanctuary. These last words are not to be understood literally, but
spiritually. Allowing them to tread the temple is regarded as equivalent
to appointing them to take charge of the worship in the temple. For שׁמר
, see [Lev 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#030.md); [Lev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#009.md), and the commentary on [Lev
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035.md).

The Lord would guard against such desecration of His sanctuary in the
future. To this end the following precepts concerning the worship in the
new temple are given. - [Eze 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#009.md).
Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and
uncircumcised in flesh, shall come into my sanctuary, of all the
foreigners that are in the midst of the sons of Israel; [Eze
44:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#010.md). But even the Levites, who have
gone away from me in the wandering of Israel, which wandered away from
me after its idols, they shall bear their guilt. [Eze
44:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#011.md). They shall be servants in my
sanctuary, as guards at the gates of the house and serving in the house;
they shall slay the burnt-offering and the slain-offering for the
people, and shall stand before it to serve them. [Eze
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#012.md). Because they served them before
their idols, and became to the house of Israel a stumbling-block to
guilt, therefore I have lifted my hand against them, is the saying of
the Lord Jehovah, that they should bear their guilt. [Eze
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#013.md). They shall not draw near to me
to serve me as priests, and to draw near to all my holy things, to the
most holy, but shall bear their disgrace and all their abominations
which they have done. [Eze 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#014.md). And
so will I make them guards of the charge of the house with regard to all
its service, and to all that is performed therein. [Eze
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#015.md). But the priests of the tribe of
Levi, the sons of Zadok, who have kept the charge of my sanctuary on the
wandering of the sons of Israel from me, they shall draw near to me to
serve me, and stand before me, offer to me fat and blood, is the saying
of the Lord Jehovah. [Eze 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#016.md). They
shall come into my sanctuary, and they draw near to my table to serve
me, and shall keep my charge. - In order that all desecration may be
kept at a distance from the new sanctuary, foreigners uncircumcised in
heart and flesh are not to be admitted into it; and even of the Levites
appointed for the service of the sanctuary according to the Mosaic law,
all who took part in the falling away of the people into idolatry are to
be excluded from investiture with the priests' office as a punishment
for their departure from the Lord, and only to be allowed to perform
subordinate duties in connection with the worship of God. On the other
hand, the descendants of Zadok, who kept themselves free from all
straying into idolatry, are to perform the specifically priestly service
at the altar and in the sanctuary, and they alone. The meaning and
design of the command, to shut out the foreigners uncircumcised in heart
from all access to the sanctuary, are not that the intermediate position
and class of foreigners living in Israel should henceforth be abolished
(Kliefoth); for this would be at variance with [Eze
47:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#022.md) and [Eze
47:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#023.md), according to which the
foreigners (גּרים) were to receive a possession of their own in the
fresh distribution of the land, which not only presupposes their
continuance within the congregation of Israel, but also secures it for
the time to come. The meaning is rather this: No heathen uncircumcised
in heart, i.e., estranged in life from God, shall have access to the
altar in the new sanctuary. The emphasis of the prohibition lies here,
as in [Eze 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#007.md), upon their being
uncircumcised in heart; and the reason for the exclusion of foreigners
consists not so much in the foreskin of the flesh as in the spiritual
foreskin, so that not only the uncircumcised heathen, but also
Israelites who were circumcised in flesh, were to keep at a distance
from the sanctuary if they failed to possess circumcision of heart. The
ל before כּל־בּן serves the purpose of comprehension, as in [Gen
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#010.md); [Lev
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#042), etc. (compare Ewald, ֗310a.md).
Not only are foreigners who are estranged from God to be prevented from
coming into the sanctuary, but even the Levites, who fell into idolatry
at the time of the apostasy of the Israelites, are to bear their guilt,
i.e., are to be punished for it by exclusion from the rights of the
priesthood. This is the connection between the tenth verse and the
ninth, indicated by כּי אם, which derives its meaning, truly (imo), yea
even, from this connection, as in [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md). הלויּם are not the Levites here
as distinguished from the priests (Aaronites), but all the descendants
of Levi, including the Aaronites chosen for the priests' office, to whom
what is to be said concerning the Levites chiefly applied. The division
of the Levites into such as are excluded from the service and office of
priests (כּהן, [Eze 44:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#013).md) on account
of their former straying into idolatry, and the sons of Zadok, who kept
aloof from that wandering, and therefore are to be the only persons
allowed to administer the priests' office for the future, shows very
clearly that the threat "they shall bear their guilt" does not apply to
the common Levites, but to the Levitical priests. They are to be
degraded to the performance of the inferior duties in the temple and at
divine worship. The guilt with which they are charged is that they
forsook Jehovah when the people strayed into idolatry. Forsaking Jehovah
involves both passive and active participation in idolatry (cf. [Jer
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005).md). This wandering of the Israelites
from Jehovah took place during the whole time that the tabernacle and
Solomon's temple were in existence, though at different periods and with
varying force and extent.

Bearing the guilt is more minutely defined in [Eze
44:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#011.md). The Levitical priests who
have forsaken the Lord are to lose the dignity and rights of the
priesthood; they are not, indeed, to be entirely deprived of the
prerogative conferred upon the tribe of Levi by virtue of its election
to the service of the sanctuary in the place of the first-born of the
whole nation, but henceforth they are merely to be employed in the
performance of the lower duties, as guards at the gates of the temple,
and as servants of the people at the sacrificial worship, when they are
to slaughter the animals for the people, which every one who offered
sacrifice was also able to do for himself. Because they have already
served the people before their idols, i.e., have helped them in their
idolatry, they shall also serve the people in time to come in the
worship of God, though not as priests, but simply in non-priestly
occupations. The words 'המּה יעמדוּ are taken from [Num
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#009.md), and the suffixes in לפּניהם and
לשׁרתּם refer to עם. מכשׁול עון .עם ot ref, as in [Eze
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019.md); [Eze
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003.md); [Eze
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030.md). נשׂא יד, not to raise the arm
to smite, but to lift up the hand to swear, as in [Eze
20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005.md), etc. לגשׁת על כּל־קדשׁי, to
draw near to all my holy things. קדשׁים are not the rooms in the
sanctuary, but those portions of the sacrifices which were sacred to the
Lord. They are not to touch these, i.e., neither to sprinkle blood nor
to burn the portions of fat upon the altar, or perform anything
connected therewith. This explanation is required by the apposition
אל־קדשׁי הקּדשׁים, which (in the plural) does not mean the most holy
place at the hinder part of the temple, but the most holy sacrificial
gifts (cf. [Eze 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013).md). נשׂא , as in
[Eze 16:52](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#052.md). In [Eze
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#014.md) it is once more stated in a
comprehensive manner in what the bearing of the guilt and shame was to
consist: God would make them keepers of the temple with regard to the
inferior acts of service. The general expression שׁמר משׁמרת הבּית,
which signifies the temple service universally, receives its restriction
to the inferior acts of service from 'לכל עבדתו וגו, which is used in
[Num 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#026.md); [Num
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#023.md), [Num
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#030.md),[Num
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#032.md), [Num
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#039.md), [Num
4:47](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#047.md), for the heavy duties performed
by the Merarites and Gershonites, in distinction from the עבדה of the
Kohathites, which consisted in שׁמר משׁמרת הקּדשׁ ([Num
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#028).md) and עשׂות מלאכה ([Num
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003).md). The priestly service at the
altar and in the sanctuary, on the other hand, was to be performed by
the sons of Zadok alone, because when the people went astray they kept
the charge of the sanctuary, i.e., performed the duties of the priestly
office with fidelity. Zadok was the son of Ahitub, of the line of
Eleazar (1 Chr. 5:34; [Ch1 6:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#037).md),
who remained faithful to King David at the rebellion of Absalom ([Sa2
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024)..md), and also anointed Solomon as
king in opposition to Adonijah the pretender ([Kg1
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#032)..md); whereas the high priest
Abiathar, of the line of Ithamar, took part with Adonijah ([Kg1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007.md), [Kg1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#025).md), and was deposed from his office
by Solomon in consequence, so that now the high-priesthood was in the
sole possession of Zadok and his descendants ([Kg1
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026.md), and [Kg1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035).md). From this attitude of Zadok
toward David, the prince given by the Lord to His people, it may be seen
at once that he not only kept aloof from the wandering of the people,
but offered a decided opposition thereto, and attended to his office in
a manner that was well-pleasing to God. As he received the
high-priesthood from Solomon in the place of Abiathar for this fidelity
of his, so shall his descendants only be invested with the priestly
office in the new temple. For the correct explanation of the words in
these verses, however, we must pay particular regard to the clause, "who
have kept the charge of my sanctuary." This implies, for example, that
lineal descent from Zadok alone was not sufficient, but that fidelity in
the service of the Lord must also be added as an indispensable
requisite. In [Eze 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#015.md) and [Eze
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#016.md) the priestly service is
described according to its principal functions at the altar of
burnt-offering, and in the holy place at the altar of incense. שׁלחני is
the altar of incense (see [Eze 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#022).md).

[Ezekiel 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 44:17</span></span>

Requisites for the Administration of the Priests' Office, and the
Obligations and Privileges of that Office. - [Eze
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#017.md). And it shall come to pass, when
they go to the gates of the inner court, they shall put on linen
clothes, and no wool shall lie upon them, when they serve in the gates
of the inner court and serve toward the house. [Eze
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#018.md). Linen turbans shall be upon
their head, and linen drawers upon their hips; they shall not gird
themselves in sweat. [Eze 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#019.md). And
when they go out into the outer court, into the outer court to the
people, they shall take off their clothes in which they have ministered,
and put them in the holy cells, and put on other clothes, that they may
not sanctify the people with their clothes. [Eze
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#020.md). And they shall not shave their
head bald, nor let their hair grow freely; they shall cut the hair of
their head. [Eze 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#021.md). And they shall
not drink wine, no priest, when they go into the inner court. [Eze
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#022.md). And a window and a divorced
woman they shall not take as wives, but virgins of the seed of the house
of Israel, and the widow who has become the widow of a priest they may
take. [Eze 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#023.md). And they shall teach
my people, make known to them the difference between holy and common,
and between unclean and clean. [Eze
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#024.md). And they shall stand to judge
concerning disputes; and they shall observe my laws and my statutes at
all my feasts, and sanctify my Sabbaths. [Eze
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#025.md). And one shall not go to any
corpse of a man to defile himself; only for father and mother, for son
and daughter, for brother, for sister who had no husband, may they
defile themselves. [Eze 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#026.md). And
after his purification shall they reckon seven days more to him; [Eze
44:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#027.md). And on the day when he comes to
the holy place, into the inner court, to serve in the holy place, he
shall offer his sin-offering, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - [Eze
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#028.md). And so shall it be with their
inheritance, that I am their inheritance, ye shall not give them a
possession in Israel: I am their possession. [Eze
44:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#029.md). The meat-offering, and the
sin-offering, and the trespass-offering, these shall they eat, and
everything banned in Israel shall belong to them. [Eze
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#030.md). And the firstlings of all the
first-fruits of everything, and every heave-offering of everything, of
all your heave-offerings, shall belong to the priests; and the
firstlings of all your ground meal shall ye give to the priest, that a
blessing may come down upon thy house. [Eze
44:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#031.md). No carrion nor anything torn in
pieces of fowl and of beast shall the priests eat. - To the directions,
who are to perform the service in the new temple, there are appended
corresponding instructions concerning the bodily condition in which this
service is to be performed, as the bodily condition shadows forth the
state of the soul, or the spiritual constitution of the servants of God.
The dress prescribed in Ex 28 for the priests to wear during the holy
service had this signification. The same rule is here presupposed as
still in force; and it is simply renewed and partially emphasized by the
enumeration of some of the leading points. At the service at the altar
and in the holy place the priests are to wear linen clothes, and, after
the performance of the service, they are to take them off again when
they go into the outer court ([Eze
44:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#017).md). In the Mosaic law, שׁשׁ,
white byssus, or בּד, white linen, is mentioned as the material used for
the priests' clothing ([Exo 28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039.md),
[Exo 28:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#042).md); here the material is more
distinctly designated as פּשׁתּים, flax linen; and צמר, animal wool, is
expressly forbidden, the motive being assigned for this regulation,
namely, that the priest is not to cause himself to sweat by wearing
woollen clothing. Sweat produces uncleanness; and the priest, by keeping
his body clean, is to show even outwardly that he is clean and
blameless. With regard to the putting on and off of the official
clothes, the new thorah accords with the Mosaic. For we cannot agree
with Kliefoth, who detects a deviation in the fact that, according to
[Exo 28:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#043.md), the priests were to wear
the official clothes only when they entered the tabernacle and when
approaching the altar, and, according to [Lev
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#004.md); [Lev
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#023.md), were to take them off when the
service was ended; whereas, according to [Eze
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#017.md) of the chapter before us, they
were to put them on as soon as they entered the inner court, and were
never to come before the people in the official costume. If, according
to the Mosaic law, the priests were to go before the altar of
burnt-offering in the court in their holy official dress, and not
otherwise, they must have put on this dress on entering the court; for
they could not wait till they were in front of the altar before they
changed their clothes. For the expression צאת אל העם does not imply
that, according to Ezekiel, they were never to appear in the presence of
the people in their official costume, as it does not mean "come before
the people," but "go out to the people," or "walk among the people;" nor
is this involved in the words 'ולא יקדּשׁוּ , they shall not sanctify
the people in their clothes (by their clothes). The latter by no means
affirms that they are to sanctify the people by intercourse with them,
but are not to do this in official costume; the meaning is simply that
they are not to move among the people in the outer court while wearing
their official clothes, that they may not sanctify them by their holy
clothes.

This sanctification cannot be understood in any other way than as
analogous to the rule laid down in the law, that touching most holy
sacrificial flesh would sanctify ([Lev
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#011.md), [Lev
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#020).md), which Ezekiel repeats in [Eze
46:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#020.md), and which does not stand in
anything like an isolated position in the law, but is also affirmed in
[Exo 29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037.md) and [Exo
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#029.md) of the altar of burnt-offering
and the vessels of the sanctuary. The same thing which applied to these
vessels - namely, that their holiness passed from them to any one who
touched them - is here predicated of the holy dresses of the priests;
and the moving of the priests among the people in their holy clothes is
forbidden, because such holiness, acquired by contact with holy objects,
imposed upon the person to whom it had passed the obligation to guard
against all defilement ([Lev 21:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001).md),
which the people could not avoid in the ordinary relations of life, and
thus a weakening or abolition of the distinction between things holy and
common would inevitably have ensued. לשׁכות הקּדשׁ are the holy
cell-buildings described in [Eze
42:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md). - To the clothing there is
simply appended in [Eze 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#020.md) the
direction concerning the hair of the head, the natural covering of the
head, in relation to which excess on either side is prohibited, either
shaving the head bald or wearing the hair uncut. Both of these were
forbidden to the priests in the law: shaving in [Lev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005.md), and letting the hair grow freely
in [Lev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006.md); and the latter was
simply imposed upon the Nazarites for the period of their vow ([Num
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#005).md). כּסם only occurs here; but its
meaning, to cut the hair, is obvious from the context. - [Eze
44:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#021.md). The prohibition of the drinking
of wine when performing service agrees with [Lev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md); on the other hand, the
instructions concerning the choice of wives are sharpened in [Eze
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#022.md), as that which only applied to
the high priest in the law is here extended to all the priests. In fact,
Ezekiel throughout makes no distinction between the high priest and the
common priests. In [Lev 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#014.md),
marrying a widow is only forbidden to the high priest, who was to marry
a virgin of his own people, whereas no such restriction is laid down for
the ordinary priests. Here, on the other hand, marrying a widow is
forbidden to all the priests, marriage with the widow of a priest being
the only one allowed. מכּהן belongs to תּהיה, who has become the widow
of a priest.

(Note: The Rabbins (Targ. Talm. and Masor. according to their
accentuation) have endeavoured to obliterate this distinction, by
applying the first hemistich to the high priest alone, and explaining
the second thus: "The widow, who is really a widow, the priest may
take," interpreting מכּהן by quidam sacerdotum, or aliqui ex ordine
sacerdotali, or ceteri sacerdotes. But this is contrary to the usage of
the language, as מכּהן cannot possibly be understood in a partitive
sense in this passage, where the priests generally are spoken of, and
the plural יקּחוּ follows.)

In [Eze 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#023.md) and [Eze
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#024.md) the general official duties of
the priests are mentioned, viz., to teach the people, and to instruct
them concerning the difference between the holy and the unholy, the
clean and the unclean, as in [Lev
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010.md) (cf. [Deu
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010.md) and [Eze
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026).md); also to administer justice in
questions in dispute according to the rights of God-a duty which had
already been committed to the priests in its highest form in [Deu
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md)., [Deu
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#017.md), and [Deu
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#005.md). על ריב, concerning, in the case
of, matters in dispute. עמד , to stand to judge, i.e., to appear or act
as judge (compare העמיד שׁפטים, to appoint or institute judges, in [Ch2
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#005).md). The Keri למשׁפּט is a needless
emendation after [Ch2 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#008.md). The Chetib
ושׁפטהוּ, on the other hand, is a copyist's error for ישׁפטהוּ. Lastly,
at all the feasts they are to observe the laws and statutes of Jehovah,
that is to say, to perform all the priestly duties binding upon them at
the feasts, and to sanctify the Sabbaths, not merely by offering the
Sabbath sacrifices, but also by maintaining the Sabbath rest (cf. [Lev
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003).md). - In [Eze
44:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#025.md) there follow regulations
concerning defilement from the dead, and its removal. [Eze
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#025.md) is a simple repetition of [Lev
21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001.md). But the instructions
concerning the purification from defilement from the dead are sharpened,
inasmuch as not only is the purification prescribed by the law ([Num
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001)..md), and which lasted seven days,
required (this is meant by טהרתו), but a further period of seven days is
appointed after these, at the expiration of which the presentation of a
sin-offering is demanded before the service in the sanctuary can be
resumed. By this demand for a heightened purification, the approach to a
corpse permitted to the priests, which was prohibited to the high priest
in the Mosaic law, even in the case of father and mother ([Lev
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#011).md), is tolerably equalized.

For these duties and obligations of service the priests are to receive
corresponding emoluments. These are treated of in [Eze
44:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#028.md). They are not, indeed, to
receive any share of the land as their property in time to come any more
than in former times; but in the place of this Jehovah will be their
property and possession, and give them the necessary room for their
dwellings from His own property in the land ([Eze
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#004).md), and let them draw their
maintenance from His altar ([Eze 44:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#029.md)
and [Eze 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#030).md). The promise that
Jehovah will be the נחלה and אחזּה of the priests is a simple repetition
of the regulation in the law ([Num
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md); [Deu
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md); [Deu
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009).md). So far as the construction in
[Eze 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#028.md) is concerned, the words אני
נחלתם are really the subject to 'והיתה להם לן, which we are obliged to
render obliquely, "the inheritance for them shall be, I am their
inheritance." For the proposal of Hitzig to take the words from אני
נחלתם to the close of the verse as a parenthesis, and to regard 'המּנחה
וגו in [Eze 44:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#029.md) as the subject to
'והיתה, is untenable, not only on account of the great harshness which
such a parenthesis would involve, but principally because these portions
of the sacrifices and heave-offerings which belonged to the priest were
not a נחלה, and are never designated as נחלה, inheritance, i.e.,
property in land. [Eze 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#028.md) treats of
the property in land, which God assigned to the Levites and priests
under the Mosaic economy, by appointing them towns to dwell in, with
meadows for the feeding of their cattle, within the territory of the
other tribes, but would assign to them in future from the heave-offering
set apart from the land for the sanctuary ([Eze
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#004).md). It is not till [Eze
44:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#029.md) and [Eze
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#030.md) that the means of support for
the priests are spoken of. They are to be supported from the sacrifices
and the tithes and first-fruits which Israel has to pay to Jehovah as
the lord of the land, and which He transfers to His servants the
priests. For the priests' share of the meat-offering, sin-offering, and
trespass-offering, see [Lev 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md); [Lev
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#009.md), [Lev
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#011.md), [Lev
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#019.md); [Lev
7:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006.md); for that which is put under the
ban, [Lev 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#021.md); for the first-fruits,
[Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md); [Exo
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#026.md); [Deu
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#004.md); [Num
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#013.md); for the תּרוּמות, [Num
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#019.md); [Num
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019.md); for the ראשׁית עריסות, [Num
15:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#020.md). In 'להניח, "to cause a
blessing to rest upon thy house," the individual Israelite is addressed.
For the fact itself, see [Mal 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md). -
To the enumeration of the means of support there is appended in [Eze
44:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#031.md) an emphatic repetition of the
command in [Lev 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#008.md), not to eat of
any dead thing (i.e., anything that has died a natural death), or
anything torn to pieces, either of birds or beasts, on account of its
defiling ([Lev 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015).md).
