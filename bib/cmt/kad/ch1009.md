### [1 Chronicles Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 9:1</span></span>

[Ch1 9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md) form the transition from
the genealogies to the enumeration of the former inhabitants of
Jerusalem in vv. 4-34.

[Ch1 9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md)

"And all the Israelites were registered; and, behold, they were written
in the book of the kings of Israel, and Judah was led away to Babylon
for her transgressions." The lxx and Vulg. have erroneously connected
ויהוּדה with the preceding words, and render, "in the book of the kings
of Israel and Judah," and then have translated the following words וגו
הגלוּ arbitrarily. Not less incorrect is Bertheau's opinion, that Israel
here denotes only the tribes of the northern kingdom, because Israel is
contrasted with Judah, and kings of Israel are spoken of, for both
reasons are quite worthless. "The book of the kings of Israel" is cited
in [Ch2 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034.md) (cf. [Ch2
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#018).md), and is declared by Bertheau
himself to be identical with the historical work cited as the "book of
the kings of Israel and Judah" ([Ch2
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#007.md); [Ch2
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#027.md); [Ch2
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#008).md), or as the "book of the kings of
Judah and Israel" ([Ch2 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#011.md); [Ch2
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#026), and elsewhere.md). How then can it
be inferred from the shortened title, "book of the kings of Israel,"
that kings of the northern kingdom are spoken of? Then, as to the
contrast between Israel and Judah, it might, when looked at by itself,
be adduced in favour of taking the name in its narrower sense; but when
we consider the grouping together in [Ch1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010.md) of "Israel, the priests, the
Levites, and the Nethinim," we see clearly that Israel in [Ch1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md) incontrovertibly denotes the whole
Israel of the twelve tribes. In [Ch1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md), Israel is used in the same sense
as in [Ch1 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md); and the contrast
between Israel and Judah, therefore, is analogous to the contrast "Judah
and Jerusalem," i.e., Israel is a designation of the whole covenant
people, Judah that of one section of it. The position of our verse also
at the end of the genealogies of all the tribes of Israel, and not
merely of the ten tribes of the northern kingdom, requires that the name
Israel should be understood to denote the whole covenant people. That
[Ch1 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md) forms the transition from the
genealogies to the enumeration of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and so
is properly the conclusion of the genealogies in 1 Chron 2-8, is so
manifest that Bertheau cannot adduce a single tenable ground for his
assertion to the contrary, that "the verse forms clearly quite a new
beginning." For the assertion, "We recognise in it a short introduction
to the historical statements regarding the tribe of Judah or the
Israelites after the exile," cannot be adduced in support of his view,
since it not only contradicts his former assertion that Israel here
denotes the northern kingdom, but is also irreconcilable with the words
of the verse.

(Note: Bertheau's further remark, "[Ch1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md) cannot have been written by our
historian, because he did not consider it sufficient to refer his
readers to the work he quotes from, but thought himself bound to
communicate genealogical registers of the tribes of the northern kingdom
(1 Chron 5-7), which he must have extracted from older registers
prepared in the time of the kings (cf. [Ch1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001).md), perhaps even out of the work
here named," is quite incomprehensible by me. Notwithstanding repeated
consideration of it clause by clause, I have not succeeded in
comprehending the logic of this argument.)

The statement, "Judah was led captive to Babylon for her
transgressions," corresponds to the statement [Ch1
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025.md)., [Ch1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015.md). But when, after this statement,
our writer continues, "And the former inhabitants which (lived) in their
possessions in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and
the Nethinim; and in Jerusalem there dwelt of the sons of Judah," etc.,
the "former inhabitants" can only be those who dwelt in their
possessions before Judah was led captive into Babylon. This could hardly
be misunderstood by any commentator, if the right interpretation of our
passage were not obscured by the similarity of the register of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem which follows to that contained in Neh 11, - a
similarity which has led some to believe that both registers treat of
the post-exilic inhabitants of Jerusalem. Bertheau, e.g., comes to the
following decision as to the relation of our register, vv. 2-34, to that
in Neh 11:3-24: "As the result of the comparison, we have found that
both registers correspond exactly in their plan, and agree as to all the
main points in their contents." The first point in this result has some
foundation; for if we turn our attention only to the enumeration of
chiefs dwelling in Jerusalem, then the registers in [Ch1
9:4-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004.md) of our chapter and in Neh
11:3-19 are identical in plan. But if we consider the whole of the
registers, as found in 1 Chron 9:2-34 and Neh 11:3-24, we see that they
do differ in plan; for in ours, the enumeration of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem is introduced by the remark, [Ch1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md), "The former inhabitants in their
possessions in their cities, were Israel, the priests," etc., according
to which the following words, [Ch1
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003.md), "And in Jerusalem there dwelt of
the sons of Judah," etc., can only be understood of the pre-exilic
inhabitants. When Bertheau refers, in opposition to this, to [Neh
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015.md), where the time between
Zerubbabel and Ezra is called the time of the former governors (הראשׁנים
הפּחות), with whom Nehemiah contrasts himself, the later governor, to
prove that according to that the former inhabitants in our passage may
very well denote the inhabitants of the land in the first century of the
restored community, he forgets that the governors were changed within
short periods, so that Nehemiah might readily call his predecessors in
the office "former governors;" while the inhabitants of the cities of
Judah, on the contrary, had not changed during the period from
Zerubbabel to Ezra, so as to allow of earlier and later inhabitants
being distinguished. From the fact that the inhabitants "of their
cities" are not contrasted as the earlier, with the inhabitants of
Jerusalem as the later, but that both are placed together in such a way
as to exclude such a contrast, it is manifest that the conclusion drawn
by Movers and Bertheau from [Neh 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md),
that the "former inhabitants in their possessions in their cities" are
those who dwelt in Jerusalem before it was peopled by the inhabitants of
the surrounding district, is not tenable. In Neh 11, on the contrary,
the register is introduced by the remark, [Ch1
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003.md), "These are the heads of the
province who dwelt in Jerusalem; and they dwelt in the cities of Judah,
each in his possession in their cities, Israel, the priests," etc. This
introduction, therefore, announces a register of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and of the other cities of Judah, at that time, i.e., at the
time of Ezra and Nehemiah. To this corresponds the manner in which the
register has been made out, as in vv. 3-24 the inhabitants of Jerusalem
are enumerated, and in [Ch1 9:25-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#025.md)
the inhabitants of the other cities. The register in our chapter, on the
contrary, deals only with the inhabitants of Jerusalem (vv. 3-19a),
while in vv. 19b-34 there follow remarks as to the duties devolving upon
the Levites. No mention is made in the register of the inhabitants of
other cities, or of Israelites, priests, and Levites, who dwelt in their
cities outside of Jerusalem ([Ch1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002).md), because all that was necessary
had been already communicated in the preceding genealogies (1 Chron
2-8).

[Ch1 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003.md)

[Ch1 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003.md), too, is not, as Bertheau and
others think, "the superscription of the register of those dwelling in
Jerusalem;" for were it that, mention must have been made in it of the
priests and Levites, the enumeration of whom fills up the greater part
of the following register, vv. 10-33. [Ch1
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003.md) corresponds rather to [Ch1
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035.md), and serves to introduce the
contents of the whole chapter, and with it commences the enumeration
itself. In Neh 11, consequently, we have a register of the inhabitants
of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, while our chapter contains only a
register of the former inhabitants of Jerusalem. Only in so far as it
treats of the inhabitants of Jerusalem does Nehemiah's register resemble
ours in plan; that is, to this extent, that the sons of Judah, the sons
of Benjamin, priests and Levites, are enumerated seriatim as dwelling in
Jerusalem, that is, that heads of the fathers'-houses of these
inhabitants, as is stated by Nehemiah in the superscription [Ch1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#003.md), and in our chapter, at the end
of the respective paragraphs, [Ch1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#009.md), [Ch1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#013.md), and in the subscription, [Ch1
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#033.md) and [Ch1
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#034.md).

But if we examine the contents of the two catalogues more minutely,
their agreement is shown by the identity of several of the names of
these heads. On this point Bertheau thus speaks: "Of the three heads of
Judah, Uthai, Asaiah, and Jeuel, [Ch1
9:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004.md), we recognise the first two in
Athaiah and Maaseiah, [Neh 11:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#004.md);
only the third name, Jeuel, is omitted. Of the five heads of Benjamin,
[Ch1 9:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#005.md), it is true, we meet with
only two, Sallu and Hodaviah, in [Neh
11:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#007.md); but it is manifest that there
was no intention to communicate in that place a complete enumeration of
the hereditary chiefs of Benjamin. The names of the six heads of the
divisions of the priests, Jedaiah and Jehoiarib, Jachin, Azariah (Seriah
occupies his place in the book of Nehemiah), Adaiah and Maasiai
(represented in Nehemiah by Amashai), are enumerated in both places in
the same order. Among the Levites there occur the names of Shemaiah and
Mattaniah as representatives of the great Levitic divisions of Merari
and Gershon-Asaph, and we easily recognise our עבדיה in the עבדּא of the
book of Nehemiah. Only the two first of the four chiefs of the
doorkeepers, Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, and Ahiman, are named in the
abridged enumeration of the book of Nehemiah, while the two others are
only referred to in the added ואחיהם." Now, even according to this
statement of the matter, the difference is seen to be almost as great as
the agreement; but in reality, as a more exact comparison of the
catalogues shows, the true state of the case is very different.
According to [Ch1 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003.md), there dwelt in
Jerusalem also sons of Ephraim and Manasseh; but the catalogue from [Ch1
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004.md) onwards contains only sons of
Judah and Benjamin, and not a single Ephraimite or Manassite. The reason
of that is probably this, that only single families and individuals from
among the latter dwelt there, while the register only makes mention of
the heads of the larger family groups in the population of Jerusalem.

[1 Chronicles 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 9:4</span></span>

In the same place there dwelt, of the sons of Judah, three chiefs of the
three most important families of Judah, that of Pharez, that of Shelah,
and that of Zerah; cf. [Ch1 2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003.md). Of
the family of Pharez was Uthai, whose descent is traced back in [Ch1
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004.md) to Bani, of the children of
Pharez. The Kethibh בן־בנימן־בּני is clearly to be read according to the
Keri מן־בּני בן־בּני. The name Bani occurs, [Ch1
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#031.md), among the Merarites; while in
the genealogies of Judah, 1 Chron 2-4, neither Bani nor Uthai, nor any
one of his ancestors who are here named, is mentioned. In [Neh
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#004.md), on the contrary, there is named
of the sons of Pharez, Athaiah (עתיה, perhaps only another form of
עוּתי), with quite other ancestors; while not a single one of the five
names of the persons through whom his race is traced back to Mahalaleel,
of the sons of Pharez, coincides with the ancestors of Uthai.

[Ch1 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#005.md)

Of the family of Shelah, Asaiah the first-born, and his other) sons.
בּנין, after הבּכור, can only be understood of the other sons or
descendants. But the epithet give to Asaiah, השּׁילני, is surprising,
for it is a formation from שׁילה or שׁילן, and appears to denote a
native of Shiloh, a well-known city of Ephraim. This derivation,
however, is not suitable, since here the sons (descendants) of Judah are
enumerated; and no connection between the inhabitants of Judah and the
Ephraimite city Shiloh can either be proved or is at all likely. The
older commentators, therefore, have suggested the reading השּׁלני, as in
[Num 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#020.md), where the family of
Shelah, the third sons of Judah, is so called. This suggestion is
doubtless correct, and the erroneous punctuation השּׁילני has probably
arisen only from the scriptio plena of the word שׁילה instead of שׁלה.
This supposition is confirmed by the fact that the form השּׁלני is found
in [Neh 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#005.md), although it also is
pointed השּׁלני. In Neh. loc. cit., instead of Asaiah, Maaseiah is
introduced as בּן־השּׁלני in the seventh generation, while no ancestors
whatever of our Asaiah are mentioned. The name עשׂיה, moreover, is not
unfrequent, and occurs in [Ch1 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#036.md)
among the Simeonites; in [Ch1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015.md);
[Ch1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#006.md), [Ch1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#011.md), among the Levites; in [Kg2
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#012.md), [Kg2
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md) and [Ch2
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#020.md), as עבד of the King Josiah.
מעשׁיה is the name of many persons, e.g., in [Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018.md), [Ch1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020.md), and likewise in [Ch2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001.md); [Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md); [Jer
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021.md); [Jer
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#004.md); and elsewhere it is used of men
of other tribes: so that even should Maaseiah have been written instead
of Asaiah merely by an error of transcription, we are not warranted in
identifying our Asaiah with the Maaseiah of Nehemiah.

[Ch1 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#006.md)

"Of the sons of Zerah, Jeuel;" also the name of various persons; cf.
[Ch1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#007.md); [Ch2
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#011.md) : the register in Neh 11 notices
no descendants of Zerah. "And their brethren, 690 (men)." The plural
suffix in אחיהם cannot be referred, as Bertheau thinks, to Jeuel, for
that name, as being that of the head of a father's-house, cannot be a
collective. The suffix most consequently refer to the three heads
mentioned in [Ch1 9:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004.md), Uthai,
Asaiah, and Jeuel, whose brethren are the other heads of fathers'-houses
of the three families descended from Judah; cf. [Ch1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#009.md), where the number of the אחים
mentioned refers to all the heads who had formerly been spoken of.

[1 Chronicles 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 9:7</span></span>

Of the sons of Benjamin, i.e., of the Benjamites, four heads are named,
Sallu, Ibneiah, Elah, and Meshullam; and of the first and fourth of
these, three generations of ancestors are mentioned, of the second only
the father, of the third the father and grandfather. "And their brethren
according to their generations, 956;" cf. on [Ch1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#006.md). "All these men" are not the
brethren whose number is given, but the heads who have been mentioned by
name. Now, if we compare this with Neh 11, we meet in [Ch1
9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#007.md) with only one of the four heads
of Benjamin, Sallu, and that too, as in the Chronicle, as a son of
Meshullam, while the ancestors of both are different. Instead of the
three others in [Ch1 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#008.md), we have סלּי
גּבּי, 928; and in [Ch1 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#009.md), as
overseer (prefect), and Jehudah as ruler over the city.

[1 Chronicles 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 9:10</span></span>

The priests. - The three names Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, and Jachin ([Ch1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010).md) denote three classes of priests
(cf. [Ch1 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#007.md), [Ch1
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#017).md), who accordingly dwelt in
Jerusalem. There also dwelt there ([Ch1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#011).md) Azariah the son of Hilkiah,
etc., the prince of the house of God; cf. [Ch2
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#013.md). This is the Azariah mentioned
in [Ch1 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#013.md), the son of Hilkiah,
etc., the grandfather of the Jehozadak who was led captive into Babylon.
then in [Ch1 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012.md) we have two other
heads of the priestly fathers'-houses, with an enumeration of their
ancestors, through whom they are traced back to the classes of priests
to which they belonged respectively, viz., Adaiah to the class Malchijah
([Ch1 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#009).md), and Maasiai to the class
Immer ([Ch1 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#014).md). According to this,
therefore, there dwelt at Jerusalem, of the priesthood, the three
classes Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, and Jachin, Azariah the prince of the
temple, and of the classes Malchijah and Immer, the fathers'-houses
Adaiah and Maasiai. In [Ch1 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#013.md) the
whole number is estimated at 1760. A difficulty is raised by the first
words of this verse, "And their brethren, heads of their
fathers'-houses, 1760," which can hardly be taken in any other sense
than as denoting that the number of the heads of the fathers'-houses
amounted to 1760. This, however, is not conceivable, as
"fathers'-houses" are not single households, but larger groups of
related families. Moreover, אחיהם, which is co-ordinate with the heads
of the fathers'-houses, can only denote, as in [Ch1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#006.md), [Ch1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#009.md), the heads of the families which
belonged to or constituted the fathers'-houses. To arrive at this
meaning, however, we must transpose the words ואחיהם and לבית־אבותם
ראשׁים, connecting לבית־אבותם ר with [Ch1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012.md), and אחיהם with the number, thus:
heads of fathers'-houses, etc., were those mentioned in [Ch1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012), and their brethren 1760 (men.md),
valiant heroes in the work of the service of the house of God. Before
מלאכת one would expect the word עשׁי, as in [Ch1
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md) and [Neh
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#012.md), but its presence is not so
absolutely necessary as to warrant us in supposing that it has been
dropped out, and in inserting it. מלאכת may be also taken as an
accusative of relation, "valiant heroes in reference to the work;" or at
most a ל a tso may be supplied before מלאכת, as it might easily have
been omitted by a clerical error after the immediately preceding חיל. On
comparing our passage with [Neh
11:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#010.md), we find there, if בּן־יויריב
in [Ch1 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010.md) be altered into יהויריב,
the same three classes of priests; but instead of Azariah, Seraiah is
prince of the house of God, [Ch1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#011.md)
: thereafter we have 822 brethren, performing the work of the house (of
God). Then follows Adaiah of the class Malchijah (as in the Chronicles),
but with the addition, "his brethren 242;" and then Amashai of the class
Immer, but with other ancestors than those of the Maasiai of the
Chronicles, and with the addition, "and their brethren, valiant heroes,
128;" and finally, Zabdiel Ben Hagdolim as overseer (president over
them).

The sum of the three numbers is 1192, as contrasted with the 1760 of the
Chronicle.

[1 Chronicles 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 9:14</span></span>

The Levites. - Of these there dwelt in Jerusalem, Shemaiah the son of
Hasshub, the son of, etc., a Merarite; and ([Ch1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#015).md) Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal;
and Mattaniah the son of Micah, a descendant of Asaph, and consequently
a Gershonite ([Ch1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#016).md); and Obadiah
the son of Shemaiah, as descendant of Jeduthun, consequently also a
Merarite; and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who dwelt in
the villages of the Netophathite, i.e., of the lord or possessor of
Netopha, a locality in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem; cf. [Neh
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#026.md). This remark does not refer to
Shemaiah, who cannot have dwelt at the same time in Jerusalem and in the
village of the Netophathite, but to his grandfather or ancestor Elkanah,
who is thereby to be distinguished from the other men who bore this
name, which often occurs in the family of Kohath. All these men are,
according to the analogy of the other names in our register, and
according to the express statement of the superscription, [Ch1
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#034.md), to be regarded as heads of
Levitic fathers'-houses, and were probably leaders of the music, since
those mentioned in [Ch1 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#015.md), [Ch1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#016.md) were descendants of Asaph and
Jeduthun, and may therefore with certainty be assumed to have belonged
to the Levitic musicians. A confirmation of this supposition is found in
the superscription, [Ch1 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#033.md),
inasmuch as the mention of the singers in the first line goes to show
that the enumeration of the Levites began with the singers. If we
compare [Neh 11:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#015.md) with our
passage, we find that these two, Shemaiah and Mattaniah, are mentioned,
and on the whole their forefathers have the same names, [Ch1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#015.md) and [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md); but between the two we find
Shabbethai and Jozabad of the chief of the Levites set over the external
service of the house of God. After Mattaniah, who is chief of the
Asaphites there also, mention is made of Bakbukiah as the second among
his brethren, and Abda the son of Shammua, a descendant of Jeduthun
([Ch1 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017).md); according to which, even
if we identify Bakbakkar with Bakbukiah, and Abda with Obadiah, the
Heresh, Galal, and Berechiah of the Chronicles are wanting in Nehemiah,
and instead of these three, only Jozabad is mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 9:17</span></span>

"The doorkeepers, Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brethren:
Shallum the chief." The service was so divided among the four just
named, that each along with his brethren performed the duty of watching
by one of the four sides and chief entrances of the temple (cf. [Ch1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#024.md) and [Ch1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026).md), and these four were
consequently heads of those divisions of the Levites to whom was
committed the duty of the watch. In [Neh
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#020.md), on the contrary, the
doorkeepers mentioned are Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, 172 (men);
but the other two chiefs named in the Chronicle are there omitted, while
in the Chronicle no number is given. Here the agreement between the two
registers ceases. In the Chronicle there follows first of all, in [Ch1
9:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#018.md), some remarks on the service
of the doorkeepers; and then in [Ch1
9:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026.md) the duties of the Levites in
general are spoken of; and finally, in [Ch1
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#032.md) and [Ch1
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#034.md) we have subscriptions. In
Nehemiah, on the other hand, we find in [Ch1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#020.md) the statement that the remaining
Israelites, priests, and Levites dwelt in their cities; and after some
statements as to the service of the Levites, the enumeration of these
cities is introduced.

In glancing back over the two catalogues, it is seen that the
differences are at least as great as the coincidences. But what
conclusions are we to deduce from that fact? Bertheau thinks "from this
it is certain that both catalogues cannot have been drawn up
independently of each other," and "that both have been derived from one
and the same source, which must have been much more complete, and much
richer in names, than our present catalogues; cf. Movers, S. 234." We,
however, judge otherwise. The discrepancies are much too great to allow
us to refer them to free handling by epitomizers of some hypothetical
more detailed catalogue, or to the negligence of copyists. The
coincidence, in so far as it actually exists, does not justify us in
accepting such far-fetched suppositions, but may be satisfactorily
explained in another way. It consists indeed only in this, that in both
registers, (1) sons of Judah and Benjamin, priests and Levites, are
enumerated; (2) that in each of these four classes of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem some names are identical. The first of these coincidences
clearly does not in the least prove that the two catalogues are derived
from the same source, and treat of the same time; for the four classes
enumerated constituted, both before and after the exile, the population
of Jerusalem. But neither does the identity of some of the names prove
in the slightest degree the identity of the two catalogues, because the
names denote, partly classes of inhabitants, and partly heads of
fathers'-houses, i.e., of groups of related households, which did not
change with each generation, but sometimes continued to exist for
centuries; and because, priori, we should expect that those who returned
from exile would, as far as it was possible, seek out again the
dwelling-places of their pre-exilic ancestors; and that consequently
after the exile, on the whole, the same families who had dwelt at
Jerusalem before it would again take up their abode there. In this way
the identity of the names Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, and Jachin in the two
catalogues may be accounted for, as these names do not denote persons,
but classes of priests, which existed both before and after the exile. A
similar explanation would also apply to the names of the doorkeepers
Akkub and Talmon ([Ch1 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md); [Neh
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#019).md), as not merely the priests, but
also the other Levites, were divided for the service according to their
fathers'-houses into classes which had permanent names (cf. 1 Chron 25
and 26). Of the other names in our register only the following are
identical: of the Benjamites, Sallu the son of Meshullam ([Ch1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#007.md); [Neh
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#007).md); of the priests, Adaiah ([Ch1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012.md); [Neh
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#012).md), with almost the same
ancestors; and of the Levites, Shemaiah and Mattaniah ([Ch1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010.md).; [Neh
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#015.md), [Neh
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017).md). All the other names are
different; and even if among the priests Maasiai ([Ch1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012).md) should be identical with Amashai
([Neh 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#013).md), and among the Levites
Bakbakkar and Obadiah ([Ch1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#016.md) and
[Ch1 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#015).md) with Bakbukiah and Abda
([Neh 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017).md), we cannot identify the
sons of Judah, Uthai and Azaiah ([Ch1
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004)..md), with Athaiah and Maaseiah ([Neh
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#004)..md), for their ancestors are quite
different. The similarity or even the identity of names, were it in two
or three generations, cannot of itself prove the identity of the
persons, as we have already seen, in the genealogy of the line of Aaron
[Ch1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#003)..md), that, e.g., the series
Amariah, Ahitub, and Zadok recurs at various times; cf. [Ch1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#011.md). and [Ch1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#012.md). Everywhere in the genealogical
lines the same names very often recur, as it was the custom to give the
children the names of their ancestors; cf. Tob. 1:9, [Luk
1:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#059.md). Win. bibl. R. W. ii. S. 133;
Hvern. Einl. ii. 1, S. 179f. But if, on the one hand, the identity of
these names in the two catalogues is not at all a valid proof of the
identity of the catalogues, and by no means justifies us in identifying
similarly-sounding names by supposing errors of transcription, on the
other hand we must hold that the register refers to the pre-exilic
population of Jerusalem, both because of the wide discrepancies in all
points, and in accordance with the introductory statements in [Ch1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md). This interpretation is also
demanded by the succeeding remarks in reference to the service of the
Levites, since they throughout refer to the pre-exilic time.

[1 Chronicles 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 9:18</span></span>

The duties of the Levites. - [Ch1
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#018.md). The first half of this verse,
"And until now (is he) in the king's gate eastward," must be referred to
Shallum (Berth.). To imagine a reference to all the doorkeepers, "until
now are they," does not suit [Ch1
9:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#024.md), according to which the
doorkeepers kept guard upon all the four sides. The eastern gate of the
temple was called the king's gate, because by this gate the king went in
and out to the temple; cf. [Eze
46:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#001.md); [Eze
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md). The remark, "until now is
Shallum watcher," etc., presupposes the existence of the temple at the
time of the preparation of this register, and points to the pre-exilic
time. Against this Bertheau has raised the objection that the name
king's gate may have been retained even in the post-exilic times for the
eastern gate. This must of course be in general admitted, but could only
be accepted if it were proved that Shallum lived after the exile. This
proof Bertheau obtains by taking the words, "until now is Shallum in the
king's gate," to mean, "that, according to the ancient arrangement,
Shallum, the chief of all the doorkeepers, had still to guard the
eastern entrance; according to which Shallum would be the collective
designation of the whole series of the chiefs of the doorkeepers who
lived from David's time till after the exile;" but the words cannot be
thus interpreted. Such an interpretation cannot be made plausible by
identifying the name Shallum with Meshelemiah or Shelemiah, to whose lot
it fell in the time of David to be doorkeeper to the eastward ([Ch1
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md), [Ch1
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014).md); for in doing so, we would
overlook the fact that in [Ch1 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#021.md) of
our chapter also he bears the name Meshelemiah. The circumstance that
both Shallum and Meshelemiah are called Ben-Kore, of the sons of
Abiasaph, by no means justifies the identification of these two quite
different names; for it is neither necessary nor probable that בּן
should here be taken in its narrower sense, and Kore regarded as the
immediate father of both. The name קרא is repeated in the family of the
east doorkeepers, as we learn from [Ch2
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#014.md), where it is stated that this
office was held by a Kore ben Jimna. "These (who are named in [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017).md) are the doorkeepers for the camp
of the sons of Levi" (of the Levites), - an antiquated expression,
bringing to remembrance the time of Moses, when the Levites, on the
journey through the wilderness, were encamped about the tabernacle ([Num
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#021)..md).

[Ch1 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md)

[Ch1 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md) gives more exact information
as to Shallum's person and his official position. He, the descendant of
Kore, the son (descendant) of Abiasaph, a Korahite, and his brethren
according to his father's-house (i.e., called brethren because they,
like him, belonged to the father's-house of Korah), were over the work
of the service, viz., keepers of the thresholds of the tent, i.e., of
the house of God, of the temple, which, according to the ancient custom,
was called tent, because God's house was formerly a tent-the tabernacle.
"And his fathers (the ancestors of Shallum) were by the encampment of
Jahve, guardians of the entrance." With these words the author of this
register goes back into the ancient time; and we learn that Shallum's
ancestors, of the father's-house of the Korahite Abiasaph, had held the
office of guardian of the entrance to the house of God from the time of
the conquest of Canaan and the setting up of the tabernacle in Shiloh.
The remark in [Ch1 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#020.md), that Phinehas
the son of Eleazar was prince over them in time past, points to the same
period. In the book of Joshua and the older books there is no record of
the matter; but since the Korahites were descended through Ishhar from
Kohath, and the Kohathites held, according to [Num
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#004.md)., the first place among the
servants of the holy place, and were responsible for the holiest
vessels, we cannot doubt that the statement here rests upon accurate
historical tradition. The "encampment of Jahve" is the holy place of the
tabernacle, the dwelling of Jahve in the midst of His people. This
designation also is derived from the circumstances of the Israelites in
their wandering in the Arabian desert, and is likewise employed in [Ch2
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#002.md) in reference to Solomon's temple;
but in our verse the tabernacle is intended. It had only one entrance,
מבוא, the guarding of which was entrusted to the above-mentioned
Korahites.

[Ch1 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#020.md)

Phinehas was prince over them, not as high priest, but during the
high-priesthood of his father Eleazar, i.e., in the time of Joshua, just
as Eleazar, under the high-priesthood of Aaron in the time of Moses, had
the oversight of the keepers of the holy place, as prince of the princes
of Levi ([Num 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#032).md). The words עמּו
יהוה do not contain a historical remark, "Jahve was with him," for then
the conjunction w would stand before it, as in [Ch1
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#009.md); they are a blessing - "Jahve be
with him" - in reference, probably, to the covenant of peace entered
into with him and his descendants by Jahve ([Num
25:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011).md).

[Ch1 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#021.md)

[Ch1 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#021.md) is quite unconnected with
the preceding context, the conjunction w being omitted, and its contents
also present considerable difficulties. Zechariah, the son of
Meshelemiah, can only be the Zechariah who is mentioned in [Ch1
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#002.md) as the first-born of Meshelemiah,
and who lived in the time of David; for at the time when David divided
the porters into classes, there fell to him the lot towards midnight,
i.e., the duty of waiting at the door on the north side of the holy
place ([Ch1 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014).md). With this, indeed,
the general statement of our verse, "he was porter of the door (or the
entrance) of the tent of the covenant," is not inconsistent. But what
purpose does this general statement serve? With what design is
Zechariah, and he alone, mentioned? We have no means of giving a
definite answer to this question; but he may perhaps be named as being
the person who, before David's division of the Levites into classes was
carried out, had charge of the porters' service in the tabernacle. But
even if this conjecture be accepted as well grounded, the abrupt way in
which it is mentioned still remains enigmatical.

[Ch1 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md)

With [Ch1 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md) the narrative seems to
return to the enumeration begun in [Ch1
9:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md), so that the reflections on
the earlier times, [Ch1 9:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md), are
to be regarded as a parenthesis. [Ch1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md) runs: "They all who were chosen
for doorkeepers for the thresholds, 212 (men): they, in their villages
were they registered; they were ordained by David and Samuel the seer on
their fidelity." The infinitive התיחשׂ is used substantively, "in
reference to them, in their villages as their genealogical registration
accomplished." If [Ch1 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md) be the
continuation of [Ch1 9:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md), then the
number given (212) will refer to the doorkeepers in active service at
the time of the preparation of the register. With this hypothesis,
however, the last clause of the verse, which states that David and
Samuel had appointed them, does not seem to harmonize. But if we
consider that the four men mentioned in [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md) are heads of fathers'-houses, and
that their fathers'-houses were not extinguished at the death of their
temporary heads, and performed the same service from generation to
generation, it might well be said of the generation performing the
service at the time of the preparation of our register, that David had
appointed them to their office. The case would of course be similar, if,
as we have above supposed, the four names in [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md) are designations of the classes
of doorkeepers, for these classes also performed the same service
continually. The statements of our 22nd verse cannot be referred to the
time of David, for in [Ch1 26:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#008.md) the
number of the doorkeepers appointed by David amounted only to eighty,
viz., sixty-two of the sons of Obed-Edom, and eighteen of the sons of
Meshelemiah, which, with the addition of thirteen Merarites ([Ch1
26:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#010).md), gives a total of
ninety-three, while in our verse the number is 212. According to [Ezr
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#042.md), the number of doorkeepers who
returned with Zerubbabel was 139 men; and in the register, [Neh
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#019.md), the number is stated to be 172.
From the remark that they were registered in their villages (חצריהם, as
in [Ch1 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#041.md); [Jos
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#023), and elsewhere.md), we learn that
the doorkeepers dwelt in villages near Jerusalem, whence they came to
the city so often as their service required, as the singers also did in
the post-exilic time, [Neh 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#029.md).
יסּד, to found, set, ordain, and so appoint to an office. "David and
Samuel the seer:" הראה, the ancient designation of the prophets, for
which at a later time נביא was the more usual word; cf. [Sa1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009.md). Nowhere else do we find any
record of Samuel's having taken any part in David's arrangement of the
service of the Levites in the holy place. Samuel, moreover, was no
longer living when David began to arrange the worship at the time when
the ark was brought to Jerusalem, for he died before Saul, and
consequently before the beginning of David's reign; cf. [Sa1
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001.md) with [Sa1
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#003.md). Bertheau is consequently of
opinion that this statement of our historian rests merely upon the
general recollection, according to which the worship was organized
afresh, and established in its newer form, in the time of David and
Samuel. This is of course possible, but there is no cogent reason
against accepting the much less remote supposition that the chronicler
took this remark from his authority. The mention of Samuel after David
has not a chronological signification, but David is named first on
account of his connection with the matter in hand; for the thorough
re-organization of the worship, and the classification of the persons
engaged in carrying it on, originated with David. For these arrangements
of David, however, Samuel had prepared the way in his struggle for the
restoration of the theocracy, and of the worship which had fallen into
desuetude under Eli and his profligate sons. To do this in any measure,
he must have, without doubt, ordained trustworthy men to the individual
offices, and thus have prepared the way for King David. בּאמוּנתם is
found in [Ch1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026.md), [Ch1
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#031.md) without the suffix, with the
meaning "in good faith" (cf. [Kg2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#016.md); [Kg2
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#007.md); [Ch2
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#012).md), and accordingly is here upon
their fidelity, i.e., because they had been recognised to be faithful.

[Ch1 9:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#023.md)

They (those ordained by David) and their sons (descendants) were at the
doors of the house of Jahve-of the tent-house (האהל בּית is added to
בּית־יהוה, in order that the latter might not be confined to Solomon's
temple); for the watch (משׁמרות of persons, as in [Neh
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#009.md); [Neh
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#003.md), [Neh
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016).md), according to the four winds
(quarters) were they, i.e., the doorkeepers stood so, in accordance with
the arrangement made by David; cf. [Ch1
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014.md).

[Ch1 9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#025.md)

"And their brethren in their villages (cf. [Ch1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022).md) were bound to come the seventh
day, from time to time, with these." The infinitive בּוא with ל
expresses duty, as in [Ch1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001.md). The
seventh day is the Sabbath of the week, on which each class in order had
to take charge of the services. אלּה עם are the chiefs mentioned in [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md) who dwelt in Jerusalem, and of
whom it is said in [Ch1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026.md), "for
they are on their fidelity, the four mighty of the doorkeepers." In
explanation of the גּבּרי, Bertheau very fittingly compares σταρτηγοῖ
τοῦ Ἱεροῦ, [Luk 22:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#052.md). The words
הלויּם הם, which may be translated, "they are the Levites," or "they
(viz., the Levites)," are somewhat surprising. The Masoretic punctuation
demands the latter translation, when the words would be an emphatic
elucidation of the preceding המּה. Were they a subscription, we should
expect אלּה instead of הם; while, on the other hand, the circumstance
noticed by Bertheau, that in the following verses the duties not merely
of the doorkeepers, but of the Levites in general, are enumerated, would
seem to favour that sense. Even in the second half of the [Ch1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md) it is not the doorkeepers who are
spoken of, but the Levites in general. May we not suppose that the text
originally stood היוּ הלויּם וּמן (cf. [Ch1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#014).md) instead of והיוּ הויּם והם, and
that the reading of our present text, having originated in a
transcriber's error, found acceptance from the circumstance that [Ch1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#027.md) apparently still treats of, or
returns to, the service of the doorkeepers? So much is certain, that
from [Ch1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026.md) onward the duties of
the Levites in general, no longer those of the doorkeepers, are spoken
of, and that consequently we must regard the Levites (הלויּם), and not
the before-mentioned four doorkeepers, as the subject of והיוּ: "and the
Levites were over the cells of the storehouses of the house of God." The
cells in the outbuildings of the temple served as treasure-chambers and
storehouses for the temple furniture. האוצרות with the article in the
stat. constr. (Ew. 290, d.), because of the looser connection, since the
genitive בּית־הא also belongs to הלּשׁכוה.

[Ch1 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#027.md)

[Ch1 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#027.md) refers again to the
doorkeepers. They passed the night around the house of God, because the
care of or watch over it was committed to them, and "they were over the
key, and that every morning," i.e., they had to open the door every
morning. מפתּח occurs again in [Jdg
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#025.md) and [Isa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022.md), in the signification key, which
is suitable here also.

[Ch1 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#028.md)

And of them (the Levites), some were over the vessels of the service, by
which we are probably to understand the costly vessels, e.g., the golden
cups for the libations, etc., which were brought from the
treasure-chamber only for a short time for use in the service. They were
brought, according to the number, into the place where the service took
place, and after being again numbered, were again carried forth; and
according to [Ch1 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#029.md), other Levites
were set over הכּלים and over הקּדשׁ כּלי.

[Ch1 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#029.md)

And of them, others were set over the vessels (in general), and over all
the holy vessels which were used for the daily sacrificial service, and
over the fine flour (סלת, vide on [Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001).md), wine, oil, and incense which was
required therein for the meat and drink offerings, and the בּשׂמים,
spicery, for the holy perfumes (frankincense, cf. [Exo
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#006).md).

[Ch1 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#030.md)

And of the priests' sons were preparers of the ointments for the spices.
It is the preparation from various spices of the holy anointing oil,
[Exo 30:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023.md), which is meant, and
which consequently was part of the priest's duty.

[Ch1 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#031.md)

Mattithiah, the first-born of the Korahite Shallum (vide [Ch1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019).md), was on good faith over the
panbakings (pastry) for the meat-offerings, over the preparation of
which he was to watch. To the name Mattithiah מן־הלויּם is added, in
contrast to the הכּהנים מן־בּני in [Ch1
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#030.md). The word החבתּים (pastry,
panbaking) occurs here only; cf. מחבת, pan of sheet iron, [Exo
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#003.md).

[Ch1 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#032.md)

Finally, to some of the Kohathites was committed the preparation of the
shew-bread, which required to be laid on the table fresh every Sabbath;
cf. [Lev 24:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005.md). The suffix אחיהם
refers back to the Levites of the father's-house of Korah in [Ch1
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#032.md).

[Ch1 9:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#033.md)

[Ch1 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#033.md), [Ch1
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#034.md) contain subscriptions to the
section vv. 14-32. Since the enumeration of the Levites dwelling in
Jerusalem in [Ch1 9:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#014.md) began with
the Levitic singer families, so here we find that the singers are
mentioned in the first subscription, "these are the singers, heads of
fathers'-houses of the Levites," with an additional remark as to their
service: "In the cells free, for day and night it is incumbent upon them
to be in service," which is somewhat obscure. פּטוּרים, from פּטר, in
later Hebrew, let loose, set free. Rashi and Kimchi have already
translated it, immunes ab aliis nempe ministeriis, or ab omni alio
officio. Adopting this linguistically assured translation, we must
supply with בּלּשׁכת, dwelling or waiting in the cells of the courts of
the temple, freed from every other business in order that they may apply
themselves wholly to their service, for they are wholly busied therewith
day and night. Day and night is not to be pressed, but signifies
perpetually, continually. Bertheau translates בּמּלאכה עליהם, "they were
over them in the service," i.e., had to take the oversight of the
singers subordinate to them. but this can hardly be correct; and the
passage quoted to justify this translation, [Ch2
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#012.md), proves nothing, because there
מפקד is used along with it. We therefore prefer to take עליהם in the
signification "it is incumbent upon them," although we should then
expect המּלאכה instead of בּמּלאכה; cf. [Ch1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#027.md). Yet בּמּלאכה can in this
connection quite well be used elliptically or concisely for "to be in
service," i.e., to carry on their musical duties. The second
subscription ([Ch1 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#034).md) refers to all
the Levites, and is similar in contents and form to that in [Ch1
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#028.md).

The family of King Saul. - This register has already occurred in [Ch1
8:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md), along with those of other
families of the tribe of Benjamin, and is repeated here only to connect
the following history of the kingship with the preceding genealogical
lists. It forms here the introduction to the narrative of Saul's death
in [Ch1 10:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001.md), which in turn forms
the transition to the kingship of David. The deviations of this register
from that in [Ch1 8:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md), show that
it has been derived from another document in more complete preservation
than that in 1 Chron 8, which had been handed down in connection with
other genealogies of the Benjamite families, and had suffered
considerably in its text. See the commentary on [Ch1
8:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md).
