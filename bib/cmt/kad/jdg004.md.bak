Oppression of Israel by Jabin, and Deliverance by Deborah and Barak -
Judges 4-5

This fresh oppression of the Israelites, and the glorious victory which
they obtained over Sisera, Jabin's general, through the judge Deborah
and the heroic warrior Barak, are so fully described in Deborah's
triumphal song in Judg 5, that this song may be regarded as a poetical
commentary upon that event. It by no means follows from this fact,
however, that the historical account in Judg 4 was first of all founded
upon the ode, and was merely intended to furnish an explanation of the
song itself. Any such assumption is overthrown by the fact that the
prose account in Judg 4, contains, as even Bertheau acknowledges, some
historical details which we look for in vain in the song, and which are
of great assistance in the interpretation of it. All that we can infer
with any probability from the internal connection between the historical
narrative and the Song of Deborah is, that the author of our book took
both of them from one common source; though the few expressions and
words which they contain, such as שׂמיכה in [Jdg
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#018.md), תּצנח in [Jdg
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#021.md), משׁכתּ in [Jdg
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#006.md), and ויּהם in [Jdg
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015.md), do not throw any light upon the
source from which they were derived. For, with the exception of the
first, which is not met with again, the whole of them occur in other
passages-the second in [Jdg 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#014.md) and
[Jos 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#018.md), the third in the same
sense in [Jdg 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#037.md), and the fourth in
[Exo 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024.md) and [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md). And it by no means follows,
that because in the passages referred to, "yaahom is found in close
association with songs or poetical passages" (Bertheau), the word itself
must be borrowed from the same source as the songs, viz., from the book
of Jasher ([Jos 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013).md). For המם is
found in the same signification in [Sa1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010.md); [Exo
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027.md), and [Deu
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#015.md), where we look in vain for any
songs; whilst it always occurs in connection with the account of a
miraculous overthrow of the foe by the omnipotent power of God.

[Judges 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 4:1</span></span>

The Victory over Jabin and His General Sisera. - [Jdg
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001.md). As the Israelites fell away
from the Lord again when Ehud was dead, the Lord gave them into the hand
of the Canaanitish king Jabin, who oppressed them severely for twenty
years with a powerful army under Sisera his general. The circumstantial
clause, "when Ehud was dead," places the falling away of the Israelites
from God in direct causal connection with the death of Ehud on the one
hand, and the deliverance of Israel into the power of Jabin on the
other, and clearly indicates that as long as Ehud lived he kept the
people from idolatry (cf. [Jdg
2:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#018).md), and defended Israel from
hostile oppressions. Joshua had already conquered one king, Jabin of
Hazor, and taken his capital ([Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md), [Jos
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#010).md). The king referred to here, who
lived more than a century later, bore the same name. The name Jabin,
"the discerning," may possibly have been a standing name or title of the
Canaanitish kings of Hazor, as Abimelech was of the kings of the
Philistines (see at [Gen 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#008).md). He is
called "king of Canaan," in distinction from the kings of other nations
and lands, such as Moab, Mesopotamia, etc. ([Jdg
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#008.md), [Jdg
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012).md), into whose power the Lord had
given up His sinful people. Hazor, once the capital of the kingdoms of
northern Canaan, was situated over (above or to the north of) Lake
Huleh, in the tribe of Naphtali, but has not yet been discovered (see at
[Jos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001).md). Sisera, the general of
Jabin, dwelt in Harosheth of the Goyim, and oppressed the Israelites
most tyrannically (Mightily: cf. [Jdg
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md); [Sa1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#016).md) for twenty years with a force
consisting of 900 chariots of iron (see at [Jos
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016).md). The situation of Harosheth,
which only occurs here ([Jdg 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002.md), [Jdg
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#013.md), [Jdg
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#016).md), is unknown; but it is certainly
to be sought for in one of the larger plains of Galilee, possibly the
plain of Buttauf, where Sisera was able to develop his forces, whose
strength consisted chiefly in war-chariots, and to tyrannize over the
land of Israel.

[Judges 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 4:4</span></span>

At that time the Israelites were judged by Deborah, a prophetess, the
wife of Lapidoth, who dwelt under the Deborah-palm between Ramah (er Rm:
see at [Jos 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025).md) and Bethel (Beitin:
see at [Jos 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002).md) in the tribe of
Benjamin, upon the mountains of Ephraim. Deborah is called נמיאה אשּׁה
on account of her prophetic gift, like Miriam in [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md), and Hulda the wife of Shallum
in [Kg2 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md). This gift qualified her
to judge the nation (the participle שׁפטה expresses the permanence of
the act of judging), i.e., first of all to settle such disputes among
the people themselves as the lower courts were unable to decide, and
which ought therefore, according to [Deu
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md), to be referred to the supreme
judge of the whole nation. The palm where she sat in judgment (cf. [Psa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005).md) was called after her the
Deborah-palm. The Israelites went up to her there to obtain justice. The
expression "came up" is applied here, as in [Deu
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md), to the place of justice, as a
spiritual height, independently of the fact that the place referred to
here really stood upon an eminence.

[Judges 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 4:6</span></span>

But in order to secure the rights of her people against their outward
foes also, she summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh, in the
tribe of Naphtali, on the west of the Huleh lake (see at [Jos
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022).md), and made known to him the
commands of the Lord: "Up and draw to Mount Tabor, and take with thee
10,000 men of the children of Naphtali and Zebulun; and I will draw to
thee into the brook-valley of Kishon, Sisera the captain of Jabin's
army, and his chariots, and his multitude (his men of war), and give him
into thy hand." משׁכתּ has been explained in different ways. Seb.
Schmidt, Clericus, and others supply הקּרן or השּׁופר, draw with the
trumpet (cf. [Exo 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013.md); [Jos
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005).md), i.e., blow the trumpet in
long-drawn tones, upon Mount Tabor, and regard this as the signal for
convening people; whilst Hengstenberg (Diss. ii. pp. 76, 77) refers to
[Num 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009.md), and understands the blowing
of the horn as the signal by which the congregation of the Lord made
known its need to Him, and appealed to Him to come to its help. It
cannot indeed be proved that the blowing of the trumpet was merely the
means adopted for convening the people together; in fact, the use of the
following משׁכתּי, in the sense of draw, is to be explained on the
supposition that משׁכתּ is used in a double sense. "The long-drawn notes
were to draw the Lord to them, and then the Lord would draw to them
Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army. Barak first calls the helper from
heaven, and then the Lord calls the enemy upon earth." Nevertheless we
cannot subscribe to this explanation, first of all because the supposed
ellipsis cannot be sustained in this connection, when nothing is said
about the blowing of a trumpet either in what precedes or in what
follows; and secondly, because [Num
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009.md) cannot be appealed to in
explanation, for the simple reason that it treats of the blowing of the
silver trumpets on the part of the priests, and they must not be
confounded with the shopharoth. And the use made of the trumpets at
Jericho cannot be transferred to the passage before us without some
further ground. We are disposed therefore to take the word משׁך in the
sense of draw (intransitive), i.e., proceed one after another in a
long-drawn train (as in [Jdg 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#037.md) and
[Exo 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#021).md), referring to the captain
and the warriors drawing after him; whilst in [Jdg
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#007.md) it is to be translated in the same
way, though with a transitive signification. Mount Tabor, called
Ἰταβύριον by the Greeks (see lxx [Hos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001).md), the mountain of Christ's
transfiguration according to an early tradition of the church, the
present Jebel et Tur, is a large truncated cone of limestone, which is
almost perfectly insulated, and rises to the height of about a thousand
feet, on the north-eastern border of the plain of Jezreel. The sides of
the mountain are covered with a forest of oaks and wild pistachios, and
upon its flat summit, which is about half an hour in circumference,
there are the remains of ancient fortifications (see Robinson, Pal. iii.
pp. 211ff., and v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 37, 38). The words "and take with
thee 10,000 men" are not to be understood as signifying that Barak was
to summon the people together upon the top of Mount Tabor, but the
assembling of the people is presupposed; and all that is commanded is,
that he was to proceed to Mount Tabor with the assembled army, and make
his attack upon the enemy, who were encamped in the valley of Kishon,
from that point. According to [Jdg
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010.md), the army was collected at Kedesh
in Naphtali. Nachal Kishon is not only the brook Kishon, which is formed
by streams that take their rise from springs upon Tabor and the
mountains of Gilboa, flows in a north-westerly direction through the
plain of Jezreel to the Mediterranean, and empties itself into the bay
of Acca, and which is called Mukatta by the natives (see Rob. iii. pp.
472ff., and v. Raumer, pp. 39, 50), but the valley on both sides of the
brook, i.e., the plain of Jezreel (see at [Jos
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016).md), where the greatest battles
have been fought for the possession of Palestine from time immemorial
down to the most recent times (see v. Raumer, pp. 40ff.).

[Judges 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 4:8</span></span>

Barak replied that he would not go unless she would go with him -
certainly not for the reason suggested by Bertheau, viz., that he
distrusted the divine promise given to him by Deborah, but because his
mistrust of his own strength was such that he felt too weak to carry out
the command of God. He wanted divine enthusiasm for the conflict, and
this the presence of the prophetess was to infuse into both Barak and
the army that was to be gathered round him. Deborah promised to
accompany him, but announced to him as the punishment for this want of
confidence in the success of his undertaking, that the prize of victory
- namely, the defeat of the hostile general - should be taken out of his
hand; for Jehovah would sell (i.e., deliver up) Sisera into the hand of
a woman, viz., according to [Jdg
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017.md)., into the hand of Jael. She then
went with him to Kedesh, where Barak summoned together Zebulun and
Naphtali, i.e., the fighting men of those tribes, and went up with
10,000 men in his train ("at his feet," i.e., after him, [Jdg
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#014.md); cf. [Exo
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008.md) and [Deu
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006).md) to Tabor ("went up:" the
expression is used here to denote the advance of an army against a
place). Kedesh, where the army assembled, was higher than Tabor. זעק,
Hiphil with acc., to call together (cf. [Sa2
20:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#004).md). Before the engagement with
the foe is described, there follows in [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md) a statement that Heber the Kenite
had separated himself from his tribe, the children of Hobab, who led a
nomad life in the desert of Judah ([Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016).md), and had pitched his tents as
far as the oak forest at Zaanannim (see at [Jos
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033).md) near Kedesh. This is introduced
because of its importance in relation to the issue of the conflict which
ensued ([Jdg 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017) ff.md). נפרד with
Kametz is a participle, which is used in the place of the perfect, to
indicate that the separation was a permanent one.

[Judges 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 4:12</span></span>

As soon as Sisera received tidings of the march of Barak to Mount Tabor,
he brought together all his chariots and all his men of war from
Harosheth of the Goyim into the brook-valley of the Kishon. Then Deborah
said to Barak, "Up; for this is the day in which Jehovah hath given
Sisera into thy hand. Yea (הלא, nonne, as an expression indicating
lively assurance), the Lord goeth out before thee," sc., to the battle,
to smite the foe; whereupon Barak went down from Tabor with his 10,000
men to attack the enemy, according to [Jdg
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md), at Taanach by the water of
Megiddo.

[Judges 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 4:15</span></span>

"And the Lord discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his
army, with the edge of the sword before Barak." ויּהם, as in [Exo
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024.md) and [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md), denotes the confounding of the
hostile army by a miracle of God, mostly by some miraculous phenomenon
of nature: see, besides [Exo 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024.md);
[Sa2 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#015.md); [Psa
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015.md), and [Psa
144:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#006.md). The expression ויּהם places the
defeat of Sisera and his army in the same category as the miraculous
destruction of Pharaoh and of the Canaanites at Gibeon; and the
combination of this verb with the expression "with the edge of the
sword" is to be taken as constructio praegnans, in the sense: Jehovah
threw Sisera and his army into confusion, and, like a terrible champion
fighting in front of Israel, smote him without quarter, Sisera sprang
from his chariot to save himself, and fled on foot; but Barak pursued
the routed foe to Harosheth, and completely destroyed them. "All
Sisera's army fell by the edge of the sword; there remained not even to
one," i.e., not a single man.

[Judges 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 4:17</span></span>

Sisera took refuge in the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, to
escape the sword of the Israelites, as king Jabin lived at peace with
the house of Heber, i.e., with this branch of the Kenites.

[Jdg 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#018.md)

Jael received the fugitive into her tent in the usual form of oriental
hospitality (סוּר, as in [Gen 19:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#002.md),
to turn aside from the road and approach a person), and covered him with
a covering (שׂמיכה, ἁπ. λεγ., covering, or rug), that he might be able
to sleep, as he was thoroughly exhausted with his flight.

[Jdg 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#019.md)

On his asking for water to drink, as he was thirsty (צמתּי, defective
form for צמאתּי), she handed him milk from her bottle, and covered him
up again. She gave him milk instead of water, as Deborah emphatically
mentions in her song in [Jdg 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#025.md), no
doubt merely for the purpose of giving to her guest a friendly and
hospitable reception. When Josephus affirms, in his account of this
event (Ant. v. 5, 4), that she gave him milk that was already spoiled
(διεφθορὸς ἤδη), i.e., had turned sour, and R. Tanchum supposes that
such milk intoxicated the weary man, these are merely later decorations
of the simple fact, that have no historical worth whatever.

[Jdg 4:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#020.md)

In order to be quite sure, Sisera entreated his hostess to stand before
the door and turn any one away who might come to her to seek for one of
the fugitives. עמד is the imperative for עמדי rof , as the syntax proves
that the word cannot be an infinitive. The anomaly apparent in the use
of the gender may be accounted for on the ground that the masculine was
the more general form, and might therefore be used for the more definite
feminine. There are not sufficient grounds for altering it into עמוד,
the inf. abs. Whether Jael complied with this wish is not stated; but in
the place of anything further, the chief fact alone is given in [Jdg
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#021.md), namely, that Jael took a
tent-plug, and went with a hammer in her hand to Sisera, who had fallen
through exhaustion into a deep sleep, and drove the plug into his
temples, so that it penetrated into the earth, or the floor. The words
ויּעף והוּא־נרדּם are introduced as explanatory of the course of the
events: "but he was fallen into a deep sleep, and exhausted," i.e., had
fallen fast asleep through exhaustion. "And so he died." ויּמת is
attached as a consequence to וגו התּצנח ... ותּתקע, whereas ויּעף
belongs to the parenthetical clause נרדּם והוּא. This is the explanation
adopted by Rosenmller, and also in the remark of Kimchi: "the words
ויּעף נרדּם indicate the reason why Sisera neither heard Jael approach
him, nor was conscious of the blow inflicted upon him." For the
combination of ויּעף with ויּמת, "then he became exhausted and died,"
which Stud. and Bertheau support, does not give any intelligible thought
at all. A man who has a tent-peg driven with a hammer into his temples,
so that the peg passes through his head into the ground, does not become
exhausted before he dies, but dies instantaneously. And ויּעף, from
עוּף, equivalent to עיף ([Jer 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031).md),
or יעף, and written with Patach in the last syllable, to distinguish it
from עוּף, volare, has no other meaning than to be exhausted, in any of
the passages in which it occurs (see [Sa1
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#028.md), [Sa1
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#031.md); [Sa2
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#015).md). The rendering adopted by the
lxx, ἐσκοτώθη, cannot be grammatically sustained.

[Jdg 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#022.md)

When Barak, who was in pursuit of Sisera, arrived at Jael's tent, she
went to meet him, to show him the deed which he had performed. Thus was
Deborah's prediction to Barak ([Jdg
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#009).md) fulfilled. The Lord had sold
Sisera into the hand of a woman, and deprived Barak of the glory of the
victory. Nevertheless the act itself was not morally justified, either
by this prophetic announcement, or by the fact that it is commemorated
in the song of Deborah in [Jdg 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024.md).
Even though there can be no doubt that Jael acted under the influence of
religious enthusiasm for the cause of Israel and its God, and that she
was prompted by religious motives to regard the connection of her tribe
with Israel, the people of the Lord, as higher and more sacred, not only
than the bond of peace, in which her tribe was living with Jabin the
Canaanitish king, but even than the duties of hospitality, which are so
universally sacred to an oriental mind, her heroic deed cannot be
acquitted of the sins of lying, treachery, and assassination, which were
associated with it, by assuming as Calovius, Buddeus, and others have
done, that when Jael invited Sisera into her tent, and promised him
safety, and quenched this thirst with milk, she was acting with perfect
sincerity, and without any thought of killing him, and that it was not
till after he was fast asleep that she was instigated and impelled
instinctu Dei arcano to perform the deed. For Jehovah, the God of
Israel, not only abhors lying lips ([Pro
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#022).md), but hates wickedness and
deception of every kind. It is true, He punishes the ungodly at the hand
of sinners; but the sinners whom He employs as the instruments of His
penal justice in carrying out the plans of His kingdom, are not
instigated to the performance of wicked deeds by an inward and secret
impulse from Him. God had no doubt so ordered it, that Sisera should
meet with his death in Jael's tent, where he had taken refuge; but this
divine purpose did not justify Jael in giving to the enemy of Israel a
hospitable reception into her tent, making him feel secure both by word
and deed, and then murdering him secretly while he was asleep. Such
conduct as that was not the operation of the Spirit of God, but the
fruit of a heroism inspired by flesh and blood; and even in Deborah's
song ([Jdg 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024)..md) it is not lauded as
a divine act.

[Judges 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 4:23</span></span>

"So God subdued at that time Jabin the king of Canaan before the
children of Israel; and the hand of the Israelites became heavier and
heavier in its pressure upon him, until they had destroyed him." וקשׁה
הלוך ... יד ותּלך, "the hand ... increased more and more, becoming
heavy." הלך, used to denote the progress or continual increase of an
affair, as in [Gen 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#003.md), etc., is
connected with the infinitive absolute, and with the participle of the
action concerned. קשׁה is the feminine participle of קשׁה, like גּדל in
[Gen 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#013) (see Ges. 131, 3, Anm. 3.md).
The overthrow of Jabin and his rule did not involve the extermination of
the Canaanites generally.
