### [Job Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md)

[Job 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 28:1</span></span>

1 For there is a mine for the silver,

And a place for gold which they fine.

2 Iron is taken out of the dust,

And he poureth forth stone as copper.

3 He hath made an end of darkness,

And he searcheth all extremities

For the stone of darkness and of the shadow of death.

4 He breaketh away a shaft from those who tarry above:

There, forgotten by every foot,

They hang and swing far from men.

(Note: Among the expositors of this and the two following strophes, are
two acquainted with mining: The director of mines, von Veltheim, whose
observations J. D. Michaelis has contributed in the Orient. u. exeg.
Bibliothek, xxiii. 7-17; and the inspector of mines, Rudolf Nasse, in
Studien und Krit. 1863, 105-111. Umbreit's Commentary contains some
observations by von Leonhard; he understands [Job
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004.md) as referring to the descent upon
a cross bar attached to a rope, [Job
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005.md) of the lighting up by burning
poles, [Job 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#006.md) of the lapis lazuli,
and [Job 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010.md) of the earliest mode of
"letting off the water.")

According to the most natural connection demonstrated by us, Job desires
to show that the final lot of the rich man is well merited, because the
treasures which he made the object of his avarice and pride, though ever
so costly, are still earthy in their nature and origin. Therefore he
begins with the most precious metals, with silver, which has the
precedence in reference to [Job 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016.md),
and with gold. מוצא without any secondary notion of fulness (Schultens)
signifies the issuing place, i.e., the place fro which anything
naturally comes forth ([Job 38:27](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#027).md), or
whence it is obtained ([Kg1 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028).md);
here in the latter sense of the place where a mineral is found, or the
mine, as the parall. מקום, the place where the gold comes forth,
therefore a gold mine. According to the accentuation (Rebia mugrasch,
Mercha, Silluk), it is not to be translated: and a place for the gold
where they refine it; but: a place for the gold which they refine. זקק,
to strain, filter, is the technical expression for purifying the
precious metals from the rock that is mingled with them ([Mal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003).md) by washing. The pure gold or
silver thus obtained is called מזקּק ([Psa
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#007.md); [Ch1
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018.md); [Ch1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#004).md). Diodorus, in his description of
mining in Upper Egypt ([Job 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#011).md),
after having described the operation of crushing the stone to small
fragments,

(Note: Vid., the whole account skilfully translated in Klemm's Allgem.
Cultur-Geschichte, v. 503f.)

proceeds: "Then artificers take the crushed stone and lay it on a broad
table, which is slightly inclined, and pour water over it; this washes
away the earthy parts, and the gold remains on the slab. This operation
is repeated several times, the mass being at first gently rubbed with
the hand; then they press it lightly with thin sponges, and thus draw
off all that is earthy and light, so that the gold dust is left quite
clean. And, finally, other artificers take it up in a mass, shake it in
an earthen crucible, and add a proportionate quantity of lead, grains of
salt, and a little tin and barley bran; they then place a close-fitting
cover over the crucible, and cement it with clay, and leave it five days
and nights to seethe constantly in the furnace. After this they allow it
to cool, and then finding nothing of the flux in the crucible, they take
the pure gold out with only slight diminution." The expression for the
first of these operations, the separation of the gold from the quartz by
washing, or indeed sifting (straining, Seihen), is זקק; and for the
other, the separation by exposure to heat, or smelting, is צרף.

[Job 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#002.md)

From the mention of silver and gold, the description passes on to iron
and ore (copper, cuprum = aes Cyprium). Iron is called בּרזל, not with
the noun-ending el like כּרמל (thus Ges., Olsh., and others), but
probably expanded from בּזּל (Frst), like שׁרבּיט from שׁבּיט = שׁבט,
סמפּיר from ספּיר, βάλσαμον from בּשׂם, since, as Pliny testifies, the
name of basalt (iron-marble) and iron are related,

(Note: Hist. nat. xxxvi. 7, 11: Invenit eadem Aegyptus in Aethiopia quem
vocant basalten (basaniten) ferrei coloris atque duritiae, unde et nomen
ei dedit (vid., von Raumer, Palstina, S. 96, 4th edition). Neither
Seetzen nor Wetzstein has found proper iron-ore in Basan. Basalt is all
the more prevalent there, from which Basan may have its name. For there
is no special Semitic word for basalt; Botchor calls in the aid of Arab.
nw‛ ruchâm 'swd, "a kind of black marble;" but, as Wetzstein informs me,
this is only a translation of the phrase of a French dictionary which he
had, for the general name of basalt, at least in Syria, is hagar aswad
(black stone). Iron is called hadı̂d in Arabic (literally a pointed
instrument, with the not infrequent transference of the name of the tool
to the material from which it is made). ברזל (פרזל) is known in Arabic
only in the form firzil, as the name for iron chains and great smith's
shears for cutting iron; but it is remarkable that in Berber, which is
related to Egyptian, iron is called even in the present day wazzâl;
vid., Lex. geographicum ed. Juynboll, tom. iv. (adnot.) p. 64, l. 16,
and Marcel, Vocabulaire Franaisarabe de dialectes vulgaires africains,
p. 249: "Fer Arab. ḥdı̂d, hadyd (en berbere Arab. wzzâl, ouezzâl; Arab.
'wzzâl, ôouzzâl)." The Coptic name of iron is benipi (dialect. penipe),
according to Prof. Lauth perhaps, as also barôt, ore, connected with ba,
the hieroglyph name of a very hard mineral; the black basalt of an
obelisk in the British Museum is called bechenen in the inscription. If
it really be so, that iron and basalt are homonymous in Semitic, the
reason could only be sought for in the dark iron-black colour of basalt,
in its hardness, and perhaps also its weight (which, however, is only
about half the specific gravity of pure iron), not in the magnetic iron,
which has only in more modern times been discovered to be a substantial
component part of basalt, the grains of which cannot be seen by the
naked eye, and are only detected with the magnetic needle, or by
chemical analysis.)

and copper is called נחשׁת, for which the book of Job ([Job
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md); [Job
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#002.md); [Job
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#018.md); [Job
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#019.md); comp. even [Lev
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019).md) always has נחוּשׁה (aereum =
aes, Arab. nuhâs). Of the iron it is said that it is procured from the
עפר, by which the bowels of the earth are meant here, as the surface of
the earth in [Job 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#025.md); and of copper
it is said that they pour out the stone into copper (vid., Ges. 139, 2),
i.e., smelt copper from it: יצוּק as [Job
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#006.md), fundit, here with a subj. of the
most general kind: one pours; on the contrary, [Job
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#015.md). partic. of יצק. [Job
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#003.md) distinctly shows that it is the
bowels of the earth from which these metals are obtained: he (man) has
made an end of the darkness, since he turns out and lights up the
lightless interior of the earth; and לכל־תּכלית, to every extremity,
i.e., to the remotest depths, he searches out the stone of deep darkness
and of the shadow of death, i.e., hidden in the deepest darkness, far
beneath the surface of the earth (vid., on [Job
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022.md); and comp. Pliny, h. n. xxxiii.
proaem. of mining: imus in viscera ejus \[terrae\] et in sede Manium
opes quaerimus). Most expositors (Hirz., Ew., Hahn, Schlottm., and
others) take לכל־תלית adverbially, "to the utmost" or "most closely,"
but vid., on [Job 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#010.md); לתכלית might
be used thus adverbially, but לכל־תכלית is to be explained according to
לכל־רוח, [Eze 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010) (to all the winds.md).

[Job 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004.md)

Job now describes the operation of mining more minutely; and it is
worthy of observation that the last-mentioned metal, with which the
description is closely connected, is copper. נחל, which signifies
elsewhere a valley, the bed of a river, and the river itself, like the
Arab. wâdin (not from נחל = נהל, to flow on, as Ges. Thes. and Frst, but
from נחל, root חל to hollow, whence נחילה = חליל, a flute, as being a
hollowed musical instrument), signifies here the excavation made in the
earth, and in fact, as what follows shows, in a perpendicular direction,
therefore the shaft. Nasse contends for the signification "valley," by
which one might very well conceive of "the working of a surface vein:"
"By this mode of working, a small shaft is made in the vein
(consequently in a perpendicular direction), and the ore is worked from
both sides at once. At a short distance from the first shaft a second is
formed, and worked in the same way. Since thus the work progresses
lengthwise, a cutting becomes formed in the mountain which may well be
compared to a deep valley, if, as is generally the case where the stone
is firm and the ways are almost perpendicular, the space that is hewn
out remains open (that is, not broken in or filled in)." But if נחל
everywhere else denotes a valley with its watercourse, it has not
necessarily a like signification in mining technology. It signifies,
perhaps not without reference to its usual signification, the shafts
open above and surrounded by walls of rock (in distinction from the more
or less horizontal galleries or pit-ways, as they were cut through the
excavated rocks in the gold mines of Upper Egypt, often so crooked that,
as Diodorus relates, the miners, provided with lights on their forehead,
were always obliged to vary the posture of the body (according to the
windings of the galleries); and מעם־גּר, away from him who remains
above, shows that one is to imagine these shafts as being of
considerable depth,; but what follows even more clearly indicates this:
there forgotten (הנּשׁכּחים with the demonstrative art. as [Job
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005.md); [Psa
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md); [Psa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011), Ges. 109 ad init.) of (every.md)
foot (that walks above), they hang (comp. Rabb. מדלדּל, pendulus)

(Note: Vid., Luzzatto on [Isa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005.md),
where זלזלים, of the trembling and quivering twigs, is correctly traced
to זלל = דלל = זלל; on the other hand, [Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019.md), אבני־בור is wrongly translated
fundo della fossa, by comparison with [Job
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#003.md). אבן does not signify a shaft,
still less the lowest shaft, but stone (rock).)

far from men, hang and swing or are suspended: comp. Pliny, h. n.
xxxiii. 4, 21, according to Sillig's text: is qui caedit funibus pendet,
ut procul intuenti species no ferarum quidem sed alitum fiat. Pendentes
majori ex parte librant et linias itineri praeducunt. דּלל has here the
primary signification proper also to the Arab. dll, deorsum pendeere;
and נוּע is related to נוּד, as nuere, νεύειν, to nutare. The מני of
מנּי־רגל, taken strictly, does not correspond to the Greek ὑπό, neither
does it form an adverbial secondary definition standing by itself: far
away from the foot; but it is to be understood as מן is also used
elsewhere after נשׁכח, [Deu 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#021.md);
[Psa 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#013.md) : forgotten out of the
mouth, out of the heart; here: forgotten away from the foot, so that
this advances without knowing that there is a man beneath; therefore:
totally vanished from the remembrance of those who pass by above. מאנושׁ
is not to be connected with נעוּ (Hahn, Schlottm.), but with דּלּוּ, for
Munach is the representative of Rebia mugrasch, according to Psalter,
ii. 503, 2; and דלו is regularly Milel, whereas [Isa
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014.md) is Milra without any evident
reason. The accentuation here follows no fixed law with equally
regulated exceptions (vid., Olsh. 233, c).

Moreover, the perception that [Job
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004.md) speaks of the shaft of the mine,
and the descent of the miners by a rope, is due to modern exegesis; even
Schultens, who here exclaims: Cimmeriae tenebrae, quas me exsuperaturum
vix sperare ausim, perceived the right thing, but only imperfectly as
yet. By נחל he understands the course or vein of the metal, where it is
embedded; and, since he understands גר after the Arab. ‛garr, foot of
the mountain, he translates: rumpit (homo) alveum de pede montis.
Rosenm., on the other hand, correctly translates: canalem deorsum actum
ex loco quo versatur homo. Schlottm. understands by gr the miner himself
dwelling as a stranger in his loneliness; and if we imagine to ourselves
the mining districts of the peninsula of Sinai, we might certainly at
once conceive the miners' dwellings themselves which are found in the
neighbourhood of the shaft in connection with מעם־גר. But in and for
itself גר signifies only those settled (above), without the secondary
idea of strangers.

[Job 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 28:5</span></span>

5 The earth-from it cometh forth bread,

And beneath it is turned up like fire.

6 The place of the sapphire are its stones,

And it containeth gold ore.

7 The way, that no bird of prey knoweth,

And the eye of the hawk hath not gazed at,

8 Which the proud beast of prey hath not trodden,

Over which the lion hath not walked.

[Job 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005.md) is not to be construed as
Rosenm.: ad terram quod attinet, ex qua egreditur panis, quod subtus est
subvertitur quasi igne; nor with Schlottm.: (they swing) in the earth,
out of which comes bread, which beneath one turns about with fire; for
[Job 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005.md) is not formed so that the
Waw of ותחתּיה could be Waw apod., and ארץ cannot signify "in the
interior of the earth" as locativus; on the contrary, it stands in
opposition to תחתיה, that which is beneath the earth, as denoting the
surface of the earth (the proper name of which is אדמה, from the root
דם, with the primary notion of a flat covering). They are two
grammatically independent predicates, the first of which is only the
foil of the other: the earth, out of it cometh forth bread (לחם as [Psa
104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014).md), and beneath it (the surface
of the earth) = that which lies beneath it (ותחתיה only virtually a
subj. in the sense of ותחתּיּותיה, since תּחתּי occurs only as a
preposition), is turned about (comp. the construction of the sing. of
the verb with the plur. subj. [Job
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#015)) as (by.md) fire Instar ignis,
scil. subvertentis); i.e., the earth above furnishes nourishment to man,
but that not satisfying him, he also digs out its inward parts (comp.
Pliny, h. n. xxxiii. proaem.: in sede Manium opes quaerimus, tanquam
parum benigna fertilique quaqua calcatur), since this is turned or
tossed about (comp. מהפּכה, the special word for the overthrow of Sodom
by fire) by mining work, as when fire breaks out in a house, or even as
when a volcanic fire rumbles within a mountain (Castalio: agunt per
magna spatia cuniculos et terram subeunt non secus ac ignis facet ut in
Aetna et Vesuvio). The reading במו (Schlottm.) instead of כמו is
natural, since fire is really used to blast the rock, and to separate
the ore from the stone; but, with the exception of Jerome, who has
arbitrarily altered the text (terra, de qua oriebatur panis in loco suo,
igni subversa est), all the old translations reproduce כמו, which even
Nasse, in opposition to von Veltheim, thinks suitable: Man's restless
search, which rummages everything through, is compared to the
unrestrainable ravaging fire.

[Job 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#006.md) also consists of two
grammatically independent assertions: the place (bed) of the sapphire is
its rock. Must we refer לו to ספּיר, and translate: "and it contains
fine dust of gold" (Hirz., Umbr., Stick., Nasse)? It is possible, for
Theophrastus (p. 692, ed. Schneider) says of the sapphire it is ὥσπερ
χρυσόπαστος, as it were covered with gold dust or grains of gold; and
Pliny, h. n. xxxvii. 9, 38f.: Inest ei (cyano) aliquando et aureus
pulvis qualis in sapphiris, in iis enim aurum punctis conlucet, which
nevertheless does not hold good of the proper sapphire, but of the azure
stone (lapis lazuli) which is confounded with it, a variegated species
of which, with gold, or rather with iron pyrites glittering like gold,
is specially valued.

(Note: Comp. Quenstedt, Handbuch der Mineralogie (1863), S. 355 and
302.)

But Schultens rightly observes: vix cerdiderim, illum auratilem
pulvisculum sapphiri peculiari mentione dignum; and Schlottm.: such a
collateral definition to ספיר, expressed in a special clause (not a
relative one), has something awkward about it. On the other hand, עפרת
זהב is a perfectly suitable appellation of gold ore. "The earth, which
is in itself black," says Diodorus in the passage quoted before, "is
interspersed with veins of marble, which is of such pre-eminent
whiteness, that its brilliance surpasses everything that glitters, and
from it the overseers of the mine prepare gold with a large number of
workmen." And further on, of the heating of this gold ore he says: "the
hardest auriferous earth they burn thoroughly in a large fire; thus they
make it soft, so that it can be worked by the hand." עפרת זהב is a still
more suitable expression for such auriferous earth and ore than for the
nuggets of ἄπυρος χρυσός (i.e., unsmelted) of the size of a chestnut,
which, according to Diodorus, ii. 50, are obtained in mines in Arabia
(μεταλλεύεται). But it is inadmissible to refer לו to man, for the
clause would then require to be translated: and gold ore is to him = he
has, while it is the rather intended to be said that the interior of the
earth has gold ore. לו is therefore, with Hahn and Schlottm., to be
referred to מקום: and this place of the sapphire, it contains gold. The
poet might have written להּ but לו implies that where the sapphire is
found, gold is also found. The following נתיב (with Dech), together with
the following relative clause, is connected with אבניה, or even with
מקום, which through [Job 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#006.md) is
become the chief subj.: the place of the sapphire and of the gold is the
rock of the bowels of the earth, - a way, which, etc., i.e., such a
place is the interior of the earth, accessible to no living being of the
earth's surface except to man alone. The sight of the bird of prey, the
עיט, ἀετός, and of the איּה, i.e., the hawk or kite, reaches from above
far and wide beneath;

(Note: The איה - says the Talmud b. Chullin, 63b - is in Babylon, and
seeth a carcase in the land of Israel.)

the sons of pride, שׁחץ (also Talmud. arrogance, ferocia, from שׁחץ =
Arab. šachaṣa, to raise one's self, not: fatness, as Meier, after Arab.
šachuṣa, to be fat, thick), i.e., the beasts of prey, especially the
lion, שׁחל (vid., on [Job 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#010.md), from
שׁחל, Arab. sḥl, to roar, Arab. of the ass, comp. the Lat. rudere used
both of the lion and of the ass), seek the most secret retreat, and shun
no danger; but the way by which man presses forward to the treasures of
the earth is imperceptible and inaccessible to them.

[Job 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 28:9</span></span>

9 He layeth his hand upon the pebbles;

He turneth up the mountains from the root.

10 He cutteth canals through the rocks;

And his eye seeth all kinds of precious things.

11 That they may not leak, he dammeth up rivers;

And that which is hidden he bringeth to light.

12 But wisdom, whence is it obtained?

And where is the place of understanding?

Beneath, whither no other being of the upper world penetrates, man puts
his hand upon the quartz or rock. חלּמישׁ (perhaps from חלם, to be
strong, firm: Arabic, with the reduplication resolved, chalnubûs, like
עכּבישׁ, Arab. ‛ancabûth, vid., Jesurun, p. 229) signifies here the
quartz, and in general the hard stone; שׁלח יד בּ something like our "to
take in hand" of an undertaking requiring strong determination and
courage, which here consists in blasting and clearing away the rock that
contains no ore, as Pliny, h. n. xxxiii. 4, 21, describes it: Occursant
... silices; hos igne et aceto rumpunt, saepius vero, quoniam id
cuniculos vapore et fumo strangulat, caedunt fractariis CL libras ferri
habentibus egeruntque umeris noctibus ac diebus per tenebras proxumis
tradentes; lucem novissimi cernunt. Further: he (man, devoted to mining)
overturns (subvertit according to the primary signification of הפך,
Arab. 'fk, 'ft, to turn, twist) mountains from the roots. The
accentuation הפך with Rebia mugrasch, משׁרשׁ with Mercha, is false; it
is, according to Codd. and old editions, to be accented הפך with Tarcha,
משׁרשׁ with Munach, and to be translated accordingly: subvertit a radice
montes (for Munach is the transformation of a Rebia mugrasch), not a
radice montium. Blasting in mining which lays bare the roots (the lowest
parts) of the mountains is intended, the conclusion of which - the
signal for the flight of the workmen, and the effective crash - is so
graphically described by Pliny in the passage cited above: Peracto opere
cervices fornicum ab ultumo cadunt; dat signum ruina eamque solus
intellegit in cacumine ejus montis vigil. Hic voce, nutu evocari jubet
operas pariterque ipse devolat. Mons fractus cadit ab sese longe fragore
qui concipi humana mente non possit eque efflatu incredibili spectant
victores ruinam naturae.

The meaning of [Job 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010.md) depends upon
the signification of the יארים. It is certainly the most natural that it
should signify canals. The word is Egyptian; aur in the language of the
hieroglyphs signifies a river, and especially the Nile; wherefore at the
close of the Laterculus of Eratosthenes the name of the king, Φρουορῶ
(Φουορῶ), is explained by ἤτοι Νεῖλος. If water-canals are intended,
they may be either such as go in or come away. In the first case it may
mean water let in like a cataract over the ruins of the blasted
auriferous rock, the corrugi of Pliny: Alius par labor ac vel majoris
impendi: flumina ad lavandam hanc ruinam jugis montium obiter duxere a
centesimo plerumque lapide; corrugos vocant, a corrivatione credo; mille
et hic labores. But בּקּע is not a suitable word for such an extensive
and powerful flooding with water for the purpose of washing the gold. It
suits far better to understand the expression of galleries or ways cut
horizontally in the rock to carry the water away. Thus von Veltheim
explains it: "The miner makes ways through the hard rock into his
section in which the perpendicular shaft terminates, guides the water
which is found in abundance at that depth through it \[i.e., the water
as the bottom of the pit that hinders the progress of the work\], and is
able \[thus [Job 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010.md) naturally is
connected with what precedes\] to judge of the ore and fragments that
are at the bottom, and bring them to the light. This mode of mining by
constantly forming one gallery under the other \[so that a new gallery
is made under the pit that is worked out by extending the shaft, and
also freeing this from water by making another outlet below the previous
one\] is the oldest of all, of which anything certain is known in the
history of mining, and the most natural in the days when they had no
notion of hydraulics." This explanation is far more satisfactory than
that of Herm. Sam. Reimarus, of the "Wolfenbtteler Fragmente" (in his
edition of the Neue Erkl. des B. Hiob, by John Ad. Hoffmann, 1734, iv.
S. 772): "He breaks open watercourses in the rocks. What the miners call
coming upon water, is when they break into a fissure from which strong
streams of water gush forth. The miner not only knows how to turn such
water to good account, but it is also a sign that there are rich veins
of ore near at hand, as there is the most water by these courses and
fissures. Hence follows: and then his eye sees all kinds of precious
things." But there is no ground for saying that water indicates rich
veins of ore, and בקע is much more appropriate to describe the designed
formation of courses to carry off the water than an accidental discovery
of water in course of the work; moreover, יארים is as appropriate to the
former as it is inappropriate to the latter explanation, for it
signifies elsewhere the arms of the Nile, into which the Nile is
artificially divided; and therefore it may easily be transferred to the
horizontal canals of the mine cut through the hard rock (or through the
upper earth). Nevertheless, although the water plays an important part
in mining operations, by giving rise to the greatest difficulties, as it
frequently happens that a pit is deluged with water, and must be
abandoned because no one can get down to it: it is improbable that [Job
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010.md) as well as [Job
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011.md) refers to this; we therefore
prefer to understand יארים as meaning the (horizontal) courses
(galleries or drifts) in which the ore is dug, - a rendering which is
all the more possible, since, on the one hand, in Coptic jaro (Sahidic
jero) signifies the Nile of Egypt (phiaro ente chêmi); on the other, ior
(eioor) signifies a ditch, διώρυξ (comp. [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021), יארים, lxx διώρυχες.md), vid.,
Ges. Thes. Thus also [Job 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010.md) is
consistently connected with what precedes, since by cutting these
cuniculi the courses of the ore (veins), and any precious stones that
may also be embedded there, are laid bare.

[Job 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011.md)

Contrary to the correct indication of the accentuation, Hahn translates:
he stops up the droppings of the watercourses; מבּכי has Dech, and is
therefore not to be connected with what follows as a genitive. But
Reimarus' translation: from the drops he connects the streams, is
inadmissible. "The trickling water," he observes, "is carefully caught
in channels by the miners for use, and is thus brought together from
several parts of the reservoir and the water-wheel. What Pliny calls
corrugus, corrivatio,." On the contrary, Schlottm. remarks that חבשׁ
cannot signify such a connection, i.e., gathering together of
watercourses; it occurs elsewhere only of hunting, i.e., binding up
wounds. Nevertheless, although חבשׁ cannot directly signify "to
collect," the signification coercere ([Job
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017).md), which is not far from this
idea, - as is evident from the Arab. ḥibs (ḥabs), a dam or sluice for
collecting water, and Arab. maḥbas 'l-mâ', a reservoir, cistern, - is
easily transferable to water, in the sense of binding = catching up and
accumulating. But it is contrary to the form of the expression that
מבכי, with this use of חבש, should denote the materia ex qua, and that
נהרות should be referred to the miry ditches in which "the crushed ore
is washed, for the purpose of separating the good from the worthless."
On the contrary, from the form of the expression, it is to be
translated: a fletu (not e fletu) flumina obligat, whether it be that a
fletu is equivalent to ne flent s. stillent (Simeon Duran: שׁלא יזלו),
or obligat equivalent to cohibet (Ralbag: מהזּלה). Thus von Veltheim
explains the passage, since he here, as in [Job
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010.md), understands the channels for
carrying off the water. "The miner covers the bottom with mire, and
fills up the crevices so exactly i.e., he besmears it, where the channel
is broken through, with some water-tight substance, e.g., clay, that it
may entirely carry off the water that is caught by it out of the pit in
which the shaft terminates, and not let it fall through the fissures
crevices to the company of miners below to the vein that lies farther
down; then the miner can descend still deeper since the water runs
outwards and does not soak through, and bring forth the ore that lies
below the channel." This explanation overlooks the fact that יארים is
used in [Job 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010.md), whereas [Job
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011.md) has נהרות. It is not probable
that these are only interchangeable expressions for the channels that
carry off the water. יארים is an appropriate expression for it, but not
נהרות, which as appropriately describes the conflux of water in the mine
itself.

The meaning of [Job 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011.md) is, that he
(the miner) binds or stops the watercourses which his working out of the
pit has interfered with and injured, so that they may not leak, i.e.,
that they may not in the least ooze through, whether by building up a
wall or by collecting the water that streams forth in reservoirs (Arab.
mahbas) or in the channels which carry it outwards, - all these modes of
draining off the water may be included in [Job
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011.md), only the channel itself is not,
with von Veltheim, to be understood by נהרות, but the concourse of the
water which, in one way or the other, is rendered harmless to the
pit-work, so that he (the miner), as [Job
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011.md) says, can bring to light (אור =
לאור) whatever precious things the bowels of the earth conceals
(תּעלמהּ, according to Kimchi and others, with euphonic Mappik, as
according to the Masora כבכורהּ [Isa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004.md), גשׁמהּ [Eze
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#024.md), and also וגלהּ [Zac
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002.md), only לתפארת הקריאה ולא לכינוי,
i.e., they have Mappik only for euphony, not as the expression of the
suff.).

[Job 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012.md)

With the question in [Job 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012.md) the
description of mining attains the end designed: man can search after and
find out silver, gold, and others metals and precious stones, by making
the foundations of the earth accessible to him; but wisdom, whence shall
be obtain it, and which (ואי־זה, according to another reading ואיזה) is
the place of understanding? החכמה has the art. to give prominence to its
transcendency over the other attainable things. חכמה is the principal
name, and בּינה interchanges with it, as תּבוּנה, [Pro
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001.md), and other synonyms in which the
Chokma literature abounds elsewhere in Prov 1-9. בינה is properly the
faculty of seeing through that which is distinguishable, consisting of
the possession of the right criteria; חכמה, however, is the perception,
in general, of things in their true nature and their final causes.

[Job 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 28:13</span></span>

13 A mortal knoweth not its price,

And it is not found in the land of the living.

14 The abyss saith: It is not in me,

And the sea saith: It is not with me.

15 Pure gold cannot be given for it,

And silver cannot be weighed as its price;

16 And it is not outweighed with fine gold of Ophir,

With the precious onyx and the sapphire.

It is self-evident that wisdom is found nowhere directly present and
within a limited space, as at the bottom of the sea, and cannot be
obtained by a direct exchange by means of earthly treasures. It is,
moreover, not this self-evident fact that is denied here; but the
meaning is, that even if a man should search in every direction through
the land of the living, i.e., (as e.g., [Psa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007).md) the world - if he should search
through the תּהום, i.e., the subterranean waters that feed the visible
waters (vid., Gen. 39:25) - if he should search through the sea, the
largest bounded expanse of this water that wells up from beneath - yea,
even if he would offer all riches and precious things to put himself in
possession of the means and instruments for the acquirement of wisdom, -
wisdom, i.e., the profoundest perception of the nature of things, would
still be beyond him, and unattainable. ערך, [Job
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#013.md), an equivalent (from ערך, to
range beside, to place at the side of), interchanges with מחיר (from
מחר, cogn. מהר, מכר, mercari). סגור is זהב סגוּר, [Kg1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020.md) and freq., which hardly signifies
gold shut up = carefully preserved, rather: closed = compressed,
unmixed; Targ. דּהב סנין, aurum colatum (purgatum). Ewald compares Arab.
sajara, to seethe, heat; therefore: heated, gained by smelting. On the
other hand, כּתם from כתם, Arab. ktm, occulere, seems originally to
denote that which is precious, then precious gold in particular, lxx
χρυσίῳ Ωφείρ, Cod. Vat. and Cod. Sinaiticus, Σωφίρ (Egyptized by
prefixing the Egyptian sa, part, district, side, whence e.g., sa-rees,
the upper country, and sa-heet, the lower country, therefore = sa-ofir,
land of Ophir). שׁהם is translated here by the lxx ὄνυξ (elsewhere
σαρδόνυξ or σάρδιος), of which Pliny, h. n. xxxvii. 6, 24, appealing to
Sudeines, says, in gemma esse candorem unguis humanii similitudinem;
wherefore Knobel, Rdiger, and others, compare the Arab. sâhim, which,
however, does not signify pale, but lean, and parched by the heat, with
which, in hot countries at least, not pallor, but, on the contrary, a
dark brown-black colour, is identified (Fl.). Arab. musahham, striped
(Mich.), would be more appropriate, since the onyx is marked through by
white veins; but this is a denom. from sahm, a dart, prop. darted, and
is therefore wide of the mark. On the etymology of ספּיר, vid., Jesurun,
p. 61. Nevertheless both שׁהם and ספּיר are perhaps foreign names, as
the name of the emerald (vid., ib. p. 108), which is Indian (Sanskr.
marakata, or even marakta); and, on the other hand, it is called in
hieroglyph (determined by the stone) uot, the green stone (in Coptic p.
auannēse, the green colour) (Lauth).

The transcendent excellence of wisdom above the most precious earthly
treasures, which the author of the introduction to the book of Proverbs
briefly describes, [Job 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#014.md), is now
drawn out in detail.

[Job 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 28:17</span></span>

17 Gold and glass are not equal to it,

Nor is it exchanged for jewels of gold.

18 Pearls and crystal are not to be mentioned,

And the acquisition of wisdom is beyond corals.

19 The topaz of Ethiopia is not equal to it,

It is not outweighed by pure fine gold.

20 Whence, then, cometh wisdom,

And which is the place of understanding?

Among the separate חפצים, [Pro 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015.md),
which are here detailed, apart from זהב, glass has the transparent name
זכוּכית, or, as it is pointed in Codd., in old editions, and by Kimchi,
זכוכית, with Cholem (in the dialects with ג instead of )כ. Symm. indeed
translates crystal, and in fact the ancient languages have common names
for glass and crystal; but the crystal is here called זכוּבישׁ, which
signifies prop., like the Arab. 'gibs, ice; κρύσταλλος also signifies
prop. ice, and this only in Homer, then crystal, exactly as the cognate
קרח unites both significations in itself. The reason of this homonymy
lies deeper than in the outward similarity, - the ancients really
thought the crystal was a product of the cold; Pliny, xxxvii. 2, 9,
says: non alibi certe reperitur quam ubi maxume hibernae nives rigent,
glaciemque esse certum est, unde nomen Graeci dedere. The Targ.
translates גבישׁ by פּנינים, certainly in the sense of the
Arabico-Persic bullûr (bulûr), which signifies crystal, or even glass,
and moreover is the primary word for βήρυλλος, although the identical
Sanskrit word, according to the laws of sound, vaidurja (Pali,
velurija), is, according to the lexicons, a name of the lapis lazuli
(Persic, lagurd). Of the two words ראמות and פּננים, the one appears to
mean pearls and the other corals; the ancient appellations of these
precious things which belong to the sea are also blended; the Persic
mergân (Sanskr. mangara) unites the signification pearl and coral in
itself. The root פן, Arab. fn, which has the primary notion of pushing,
especially of vegetation (whence Arab. fann, a branch, shoot, prop.
motion; French, jet), and [Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md),
where snow and milk, as figures of whiteness (purity), are placed in
contrast with פנינים as a figure of redness, favour the signification
corals for פנינים. The Coptic be nôni, which signifies gemma, favours
(so far as it may be compared) corals rather than pearls. And the fact
that ראמות, [Eze 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#016.md), appears as an
Aramaean article of commerce in the market of Tyre, is more favourable
to the signification pearls than corals; for the Babylonians sailed far
into the Indian Ocean, and brought pearls from the fisheries of Bahrein,
perhaps even from Ceylon, into the home markets (vid., Layard, New
Discoveries, 536). The name is perhaps, from the Western Asiatic name of
the pearl,

(Note: Vid., Zeitschr. fr d. Kunde des Morgenlandes, iv. 40f. The
recently attempted explanation of κοράλλιον from גּורל (to which κλῆρος
the rather belongs), in the primary signification lappillus (Arab.
‛garal), is without support.)

mutilated and Hebraized.

(Note: Two reasons for פנינים = pearls (in favour of which Bochart
compares the name of the pearl-oyster, πίννα) and ראמות = corals, which
are maintained by Carey, are worthy of remark. (1.) That פנינים does not
signify corals, he infers from [Lam
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md), for the redness of corals cannot
be a mark of bodily beauty; "but when I find that there are some pearls
of a slightly reddish tinge, then I can understand and appreciate the
comparison." (2.) That ראמות signifies corals, is shown by the origin of
the word, which properly signifies reêm-(wild oxen) horns, which is
favoured by a mention of Pliny, h. n. xiii. 51: (Tradidere) juncos
quoque lapideos perquam similes veris per litora, et in alto quasdam
arbusculas colore bubuli cornus ramosas et cacuminibus rubentes.
Although Pliny there speaks of marine petrified plants of the Indian
Ocean (not, at least in his sense, of corals), this hint of a possible
derivation of ראמות is certainly surprising. But as to [Lam
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md), this passage is to be understood
according to [Sol 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010.md) (my friend is
צח ואדום). The white and red are intended to be conceived of as mixed
and overlapping one another, as our Germ. popular poetry speaks of
cheeks which "shine with milk and purple;" and as in Homer, Il. iv.
141-146, the colour of the beautifully formed limbs of Menelaus is
represented by the figure (which appears hideous to us): ὡς δ ̓ ὅτε τίς
τ ̓ ἐλέφαντα γυνὴ φοίνικι μιήνͅ (ebony stained with purple).)

The name of the פּטדּה of Ethiopia appears to be derived from to'paz by
transposition; Pliny says of the topaz, xxxvii. 8, 32, among other
passages; Juba Topazum insulam in rubro mari a continenti stadiis CCC
abesse dicit, nebulosam et ideo quaesitam saepius navigantibus; ex ea
causa nomen accepisse: topazin enim Troglodytarum lingua significationem
habere quaerendi. This topaz, however, which is said to be named after
an island of the same name, the Isle of Serpents in Agatharchides and
Diodorus, is, according to Pliny, yellowish green, and therefore
distinct from the otherwise so-called topaz. To make a candid
confession, we grope about everywhere in the dark here, and the ancient
versions are not able to help us out of our difficulty.

(Note: The Targ. translates שׁהם by פּנינים, βήρυλλος; ספיר by שׁבזיזא
(Arab. sbz, vid., Pott in the Zeitschr.f. K. d. M. iv. 275); פז by
אובריזין, ὄβρυζον; ראמות by סנדלכין, σανδαράχη, red gold-pigment (vid.,
Rdiger-Pott, as just quoted, S. 267); גבישׁ again by בּירוּלין in the
sense of the Arabico-Persic bullûr, Kurd. bellûr, crystal; פנינים by
מרגלין, μαργαρῖται; פטדה by מרגּלא ירקא (the green pearl); כתם by פטלון
(perhaps פּטלון, πέταλον, in the sense of lamina auri).)

The poet lays everything under contribution to illustrate the thought,
that the worth of wisdom exceeds the worth of the most valuable earthly
thing; besides which, in משׁך חכמה מפנינים, "the acquisition or
possession (from משׁך, Arab. msk, to draw to one's self, to take hold
of) of wisdom is above corals," there is an indication that, although
not by the precious things of the earth, still in some way or other,
wisdom can be possessed, so that consequently the question repeated at
the end of the strophe will not remain unanswered. This is its meaning:
now if wisdom is not to be found in any of the places named, and is not
to be attained by any of the means mentioned, whence can man hope to
attain it, and whither must he turn to find it? for its existence is
certain, and it is an indisputable need of man that he should partake of
it.

[Job 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 28:21</span></span>

21 It is veiled from the eyes of all living,

And concealed from the fowls of heaven.

22 Destruction and death say:

With our ears we heard a report of it. -

23 Elohim understandeth the way to it,

And He - He knoweth its place.

24 For He looketh to the ends of the earth,

Under the whole heaven He seeth.

No living created being (כּל־חי, as [Job
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#010.md); [Job
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#023).md) is able to answer the question;
even the birds that fly aloft, that have keener and farther-seeing eyes
than man, can give us no information concerning wisdom; and the world at
least proclaims its existence in a rich variety of its operations, but
in the realm of Abaddon and of death below (comp. the combination שׁאול
ואבדון, [Pro 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011.md), ᾅδου καὶ τοῦ
θανάτου, [Rev 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018).md) it is known only
by an indistinct hearsay, and from confused impressions. Therefore: no
creature, whether in the realm of the living or the dead, can help us to
get wisdom. There is but One who possesses a perfect knowledge
concerning wisdom, namely Elohim, whose gave extends to the ends of the
earth, and who sees under the whole heaven, i.e., is everywhere present
(תּחת, definition of place, not equivalent to אשׁר תּחת; comp. on [Job
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#009).md), who therefore, after the
removal of everything earthly (sub-celestial), alone remains. And why
should He with His knowledge, which embraces everything, not also know
the way and place of wisdom? Wisdom is indeed the ideal, according to
which He has created the world.

[Job 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 28:25</span></span>

25 When He appointed to the wind its weight,

And weighed the water according to a measure,

26 When He appointed to the rain its law,

And the course to the lightning of the thunder:

27 Then He saw it and declared it,

Took it as a pattern and tested it also,

28 And said to man: Behold, the fear of the Lord is wisdom,

And to depart from evil is understanding.

It is impracticable to attach the inf. לעשׂות to [Job
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#024.md) as the purpose, because it is
contrary to the meaning; but it is impossible, according to the syntax,
to refer it to [Job 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#027.md) as the
purpose placed in advance, or to take it in the sense of perfecturus,
because in both instances it ought to have been יתכּן instead of תּכּן,
or at least ותכּן with the verb placed first (vid., [Job
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015).md). But even the temporal use of ל
in לפנות at the turn (of morning, of evening, e.g., [Gen
24:63](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#063).md) cannot be compared, but לעשׂות
signifies perficiendo = quum perficeret (as e.g., [Sa2
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#029), mittendo = quum mitteret.md), it
is a gerundival inf. Ngelsb. S. 197f., 2nd edition); and because it is
the past that is spoken of, the modal inf. can be continued in the
perf., Ges. 132, rem. 2. The thought that God, when He created the
world, appointed fixed laws of equable and salutary duration, he
particularizes by examples: He appointed to the wind its weight, i.e.,
the measure of its force or feebleness; distributed the masses of water
by measure; appointed to the rain its law, i.e., the conditions of its
development and of its beginning; appointed the way, i.e., origin and
course, to the lightning (חזיז from חזז, Arab. ḥzz, secare). When He
thus created the world, and regulated what was created by laws, then He
perceived (ראהּ with He Mappic. according to the testimony of the
Masora) it, wisdom, viz., as the ideal of all things; then He declared
it, enarravit, viz., by creating the world, which is the development and
realization of its substance; then He gave it a place הכינהּ (for which
Dderl. and Ewald unnecessarily read הבינהּ), viz., to create the world
after its pattern, and to commit the arrangement of the world as a whole
to its supreme protection and guidance; then He also searched it out or
tested it, viz., its demiurgic powers, by setting them in motion to
realize itself.

If we compare [Pro 8:22-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md) with this
passage, we may say: the חכמה is the divine ideal-world, the divine
imagination of all things before their creation, the complex unity of
all the ideas, which are the essence of created things and the end of
their development. "Wisdom," says one of the old theologians,

(Note: Vid., Jul. Hamberger, Lehre Jak. Bhme's, S. 55.)

"is a divine imagination, in which the ideas of the angels and souls and
all things were seen from eternity, not as already actual creatures, but
as a man beholds himself in a mirror." It is not directly one with the
Logos, but the Logos is the demiurg by which God has called the world
into existence according to that ideal which was in the divine mind.
Wisdom is the impersonal model, the Logos the personal master-builder
according to that model. Nevertheless the notions, here or in the alter
cognate portion of Scripture, [Pro
8:22-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md), are not as yet so distinct as
the New Testament revelation of God has first of all rendered possible.
In those days, when God realized the substance of the חכמה, this eternal
mirror of the world, in the creation of the world, He also gave man the
law, corresponding to which he corresponds to His idea and participates
in wisdom. Fearing the supreme Lord (אדני) only here in the book of Job,
one of the 134 ודאין, i.e., passages, where אדני is not merely to be
read instead of יהוה, but is actually written),

(Note: Vid., Buxtorf's Tiberias, p. 245; comp. Br's Psalterium, p. 133.)

and renouncing evil (סוּר מרע, according to another less authorized mode
of writing מרע), - this is man's share of wisdom, this is his relative
wisdom, by which he remains in connection with the absolute. This is
true human φιλοσοφία, in contrast to all high-flown and profound
speculations; comp. [Pro 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007.md), where,
in like manner, "fear Jehovah" is placed side by side with "depart from
evil," and [Pro 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#006.md), according to
which it is rendered possible סור מרע, to escape the evil of sin and its
punishment by fearing God. "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom"
([Pro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md); comp. [Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010).md) is the symbolum, the motto and
uppermost principle, of that Israelitish Chokma, whose greatest
achievement is the book of Job. The whole of [Job
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md) is a minute panegyric of this
principle, the materials of which are taken from the far-distant past;
and it is very characteristic, that, in the structure of the book, this
twenty-eighth chapter is the clasp which unites the half of the δέσις
with the half of the λύσις, and that the poet has inscribed upon this
clasp that sentence, "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom." But,
moreover, Job's closing speech, which ends in this celebration of the
praise of the חכמה, also occupies an important position, which must not
be determined, in the structure of the whole.

After Job has refuted Bildad, and, continuing his description, has
celebrated in such lofty strains the majesty of God, it can hardly be
expected that the poet will allow Zophar to speak fore the third time.
Bildad is unable to advance anything new, and Zophar has already tried
his utmost to terrify Job for the second time; besides, Job's speech
furnishes no material for a reply (a motive which is generally
overlooked), unless the controversy were designed to ramble on into mere
personalities. Accordingly the poet allows Job to address the friends
once more, but no longer in the extreme and excited tone of the previous
dialogue, but, since the silence of the friends must produce a soothing
impression on Job, tempering him to gentleness and forbearance, in a
tone of confession conscious of victory, yet altogether devoid of
haughty triumph, - a confession in which only one single word of
reproach ([Job 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#012).md) escapes him.
[Job 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001.md) contain this confession -
Job's final address to his friends.

Job once again most solemnly asserts his innocence before the friends;
all attempts on the part of the friends to entice or to extort from him
a confession which is against his conscience, have therefore been in
vain: joyous and victorious he raises his head, invincible, even to
death, in the conviction of that which is a fact of his consciousness
that cannot be got rid of by denial. He is not an evil-doer; accordingly
he must stand convicted as an evil-doer who treats him as such. For
although he is not far from death, and is in sore vexation, he has not
manifested the hopelessness and defection from God in which the
evil-doer passes away. Job has indeed even expressed himself
despondingly, and complained of God's wrath; but the true essence of his
relation to God came to light in such words as [Job
16:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#019.md); [Job
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#009.md); [Job
19:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md). If the friends had not been
blind to such brilliant aspirations of his life in God, how could they
regard him as a godless man, and his affliction as the punishment of
such an one! His affliction has, indeed, no connection with the terrible
end of the evil-doer. Job here comes before the friends with the very
doctrine they have so frequently advanced, but infatuated with the
foolish notion that it is suited to his case. He here gives it back to
them, to show them that it is not suited to him. He also does not deny,
that in the rule the evil-doer meets a terrible end, although he has
hitherto disputed the assertion of the friends, because of the
exclusiveness with which it was maintained by them. His
counter-assertion respecting the prosperity of the evil-doer, which from
the beginning was not meant by him so exclusively as the friends meant
theirs respecting the misfortune of the evil-doer, is here indirectly
freed from the extreme appearance of exclusiveness by Job himself, and
receives the necessary modification. Job does not deny, yea, he here
brings it under the notice of the friends, that the sword, famine, and
pestilence carry off the descendants of the evil-doer, and even himself;
that his possessions at length fall into the hands of the righteous, and
contain within themselves the germ of destruction from the very first;
that God's curse pursues, and suddenly destroys, the godless rich man
himself. Thus it comes to pass; for while silver and other precious
things come from the depths of the earth, wisdom, whose worth far
transcends all earthly treasures, is to be found with no created being,
but is with God alone; and the fear of God, to avoid evil, is the share
of wisdom to which man is directed according to God's primeval decree.

The object of the section, [Job 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md),
is primarily to confirm the assertion concerning the judgment that
befalls the evil-doer, [Job 27:13-23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#013.md);
the confirmation is, however, at the same time, according to the
delicately laid plan of the poet, a glorious general confession, in
which Job's dialogue with the friends comes to a close. This panegyric
of wisdom (similar to Paul's panegyric of charity, [Co1
13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001).md) is the presentation of Job's
predominant principle, and as such, is like a song of triumph, with
which, without vain-glory, he closes the dialogue in the most
appropriate manner. If God's life has such a basis, it is not possible
that his affliction should be the punishment of an ungodly man. And if
the fear of God is the wisdom appointed to man, he also teaches himself
that, though unable to see through the mystery of his affliction, he
must still hold on to the fear of God, and teaches the friends that they
must do the same, and not lay themselves open to the charge of injustice
and uncharitableness towards him, the suffering one, in order to solve
the mystery. Job's conclusion, which is first intended to show that he
who does not fear God is overtaken by the merited fate of a fool who
rebels against God's moral government, shows at the same time that the
afflictive lot of those who fear God must be judged of in an essentially
different manner from that of the ungodly.

We may imagine what impression these last words of Job to the friends
must have made upon them. Since they were obliged to be silent, they
will not have admitted that they are vanquished, although the drying up
of their thoughts, and their involuntary silence, is an actual proof of
it. But does Job make them feel this oppressively? Now that they are
become so insignificant, does he read them a severe lecture? does he in
general act towards them as vanquished? No indeed, but solemnly, and
without vaunting himself over his accusers, he affirms his innocence;
earnestly, but in a winning manner, he admonishes them, by tempering and
modifying what was vehement and extreme in his previous replies. He
humbly submits himself to the divine wisdom, by setting the fear of God,
as man's true wisdom, before himself and the friends as their common
aim. Thus he utters "the loftiest words, which must surprise the
opponents as they exhibit him as the not merely mighty, but also
wonderfully calm and modest conqueror, who here for the first time wears
the crown of true victory, when, in outward victory conquering himself,
he struggles on towards a more exalted clearness of perception."
