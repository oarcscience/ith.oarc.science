[1 Chronicles 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 7:1</span></span>

Sons and families of Issachar. - [Ch1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md). Instead of ולבני, we must
certainly read בּני, as in [Ch1 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md),
[Ch1 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#030.md), or וּבני, as in [Ch1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md); [Ch1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011.md), and elsewhere. The לבני has come
into the text only by the recollection of the copyist having dwelt on
the so frequently recurring לבני in [Ch1
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#042.md), [Ch1
6:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#046.md), cf. [Ch1
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#048.md), [Ch1
6:56](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#056.md), [Ch1
6:62](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#062.md), for it is not possible to take ל
as the ל of introduction, because the names of the sons follow
immediately. The names of the four sons are given as in [Num
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#023.md)., while in [Gen
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#013.md) the second is written פּוּה, and
the third יוב; vide on Gen. loc. cit.

[Ch1 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#002.md)

The six sons of Tola are not elsewhere met with in the Old Testament.
They were "heads of their fathers'-houses of Tola." לתולע after אבותם
לבית (with the suffix) is somewhat peculiar; the meaning can only be,
"of their fathers'-houses which are descended from Tola." It is also
surprising, or rather not permissible, that לתולדותם should be connected
with חיל גּבּורי. לתולדותם belongs to the following: "(registered)
according to their births, they numbered in the days of David 22,600."
The suffixes ם- do not refer to ראשׁים, but to the בּית־אבות, the
fathers'-houses, the males in which amounted to 22,600 souls. As David
caused the people to be numbered by Joab (2 Sam 24; [Ch1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001).md), this statement probably rests
on the results of that census.

[Ch1 7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#003.md)

From Uzzi, the first-born of Tola, are descended through Izrahiah five
men, all heads of groups of related households ([Ch1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#004).md); "and to them (i.e., besides
these) according to their generations, according to their
fathers'-houses, bands of the war host, 36,000 (men), for they (these
chiefs) had many wives and sons." From the fact that Izrahiah is
introduced as grandson of Tola, Bertheau would infer that [Ch1
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#003.md), [Ch1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#004.md) refer to times later than David.
But this is an erroneous inference, for Tola's sons did not live in
David's time at all, and consequently it is not necessary that his
grandson should be assigned to a later time. The only assertion made is,
that the descendants of Tola's sons had increased to the number
mentioned in [Ch1 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#002.md) in the time of
David. By that time the descendants of his grandson Izrahiah might have
increased to the number given in [Ch1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#004.md). That the number, 36,000, of the
descendants of the grandson Izrahiah was greater than the number of
those descended from the sons of Tola (22,600), is explained in the
clause, "for they had many wives and sons." That the two numbers (in
[Ch1 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#002.md), [Ch1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#004).md) refer to the same time, i.e., to
the days of David, is manifest from [Ch1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#005.md), "and their brethren of all the
families of Issachar, valiant heroes; 87,000 their register, as regards
everything," i.e., the sum of those registered of all the families of
Issachar. Whence we gather that in the 87,000 both the 22,600 ([Ch1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#002).md) and the 36,000 ([Ch1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#004).md) are included, and their brethren
consequently must have amounted to 28,400 (22,600 + 36,000 + 28,400 =
87,000). In the time of Moses, Issachar numbered, according to [Num
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#029.md), 54,400; and at a later time,
according to [Num 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#025.md), already
numbered 64,300 men.

[1 Chronicles 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 7:6</span></span>

Sons and families of Benjamin. - In [Ch1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md) only three sons of Benjamin-Bela,
Becher, and Jediael - are mentioned; and in [Ch1
7:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007.md) their families are registered.
Besides these, there are five sons of Benjamin spoken of in [Ch1
8:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md), - Bela the first, Ashbel the
second, Aharah the third, Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth; while
in [Ch1 7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#003.md) five other בּנים are
enumerated, viz., אדּר, גּרא (twice), נעמן, שׁפוּפן, and חוּרם. If we
compare here the statements of the Pentateuch as to the genealogy of
Benjamin, we find in [Gen 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md) the
following sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi
(אחי) and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard (ארדּ); and in [Num
26:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038.md) seven families, of which five
are descended from his sons Bela, Ashbel, Ahiram, Shephupham, and Hupham
(חוּפם); and two from his grandsons, the sons of Bela, Ard and Naaman.
From this we learn, not only that of the בּנים mentioned in [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md) at least two were grandsons, but
also that the names אחי and מפּים (Gen.) are only other forms of אחירם
and שׁפוּפם (Num.). It is, however, somewhat strange that among the
families (in Num.) the names בּכר, גּרא, and ראשׁ are wanting. The
explanation which at once suggests itself, that their descendants were
not numerous enough to form separate families, and that they on that
account were received into the families of the other sons, though it may
be accepted in the case of Gera and Rosh, of whom it is nowhere recorded
that they had numerous descendants, cannot meet the case of Becher, for
in [Ch1 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#008.md), [Ch1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#009.md) of our chapter mention is made of
nine sons of his, with a posterity of 20,200 men. The supposition that
the name of Becher and his family has been dropped from the genealogical
register of the families in Num 26, will not appear in the slightest
degree probable, when we consider the accuracy of this register in other
respects. The only remaining explanation therefore is, that the
descendants of Becher were in reality not numerous enough to form a
משׁפּחה by themselves, but had afterwards so increased that they
numbered nine fathers'-houses, with a total of 20,200 valiant warriors.
The numbers in our register point unquestionably to post-Mosaic times;
for at the second numbering by Moses, all the families of Benjamin
together numbered only 45,600 men ([Num
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#041).md), while the three families
mentioned in our verses number together 59,434 (22,034 + 20,200 +
17,200). The tribe of Benjamin, which moreover was entirely destroyed,
with the exception of 600 men, in the war which it waged against the
other tribes in the earlier part of the period of the judges ([Jdg
20:47](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#047).md), could not have increased to
such an extent before the times of David and Solomon. The name of the
third son of Benjamin, Jediael, occurs only here, and is considered by
the older commentators to be another name of Ashbel ([Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md) and [Num
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038).md), which cannot indeed be
accepted as a certainty, but is very probable.

[Ch1 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007.md)

The five heads of fathers'-houses called sons of Bela are not sons in
the proper sense of the word, but more distant descendants, who, at the
time when this register was made up, were heads of the five groups of
related households of the race of Bela. חילים גּבּורי is synonymous with
חיל גּבּורי, [Ch1 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#009.md), and is a
plural, formed as if from a nomen compositum, which arose after the
frequent use of the words as they are bound together in the status
constructus had obscured the consciousness of the relation between them.

[Ch1 7:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#008.md)

Becher's descendants. Of these nine names there are two, ענתות and עלמת,
which occur elsewhere as names of cities (cf. for עלמת in the form
עלּמת, [Ch1 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#045.md); and for ענתות, [Jos
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#018.md); [Isa
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#030.md); [Jer
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001).md). We may, without doubt, accept
the supposition that in these cases the cities received their names from
the heads of the families which inhabited them. In [Ch1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#009.md), אבותם בּית ראשׁי stands in
apposition to, and is explanatory of, לתולדותם: "And their register,
according to their generations," viz., according to the generations,
that is, the birth-lists, "of the heads of their fathers'-houses, is
(amounts to) in valiant heroes 20,200 men."

[Ch1 7:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#010.md)

Among the descendants of Jediael we find Benjamin and Ehud, the first of
whom is named after the patriarch; but the second is not the judge Ehud
([Jdg 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015).md), who was indeed a
Benjamite, but of the family of Gera. Chenaanah does not necessarily
indicate a Canaanite family. Tharshish, which is elsewhere a precious
stone, is here the name of a person; Ahishahar, that is, Brother of the
Dawn, perhaps so named because sub auroram natur. - In [Ch1
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#011.md) the expression is contracted, as
often happens in formulae which frequently recur; and the meaning is,
"All these are sons of Jediael (for as sons of Bilhan the son of
Jediael, they are at the same time sons of the latter), (registered)
according to the heads of their fathers'-houses, valiant heroes 17,200,
going forth in the host to war." האבות ראשׁי is contracted from
בּית־אבות ראשׁי, vide on [Exo 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#025.md);
and the ל before ראשׁי, which Bertheau from a misinterpretation wishes
to remove, depends upon the התיחשׂם ([Ch1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#009).md) to be supplied in thought.

[1 Chronicles 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 7:12</span></span>

[Ch1 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#012.md) is unintelligible to us. The
first half, "And Shuppim and Huppim, sons of Ir," would seem, if we may
judge from the ו cop., to enumerate some other descendants of Benjamin.
And besides, (1) the names וחפּים מפּים occur in [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md) among those of the sons of
Benjamin, and in [Num 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#039.md), among the
families of Benjamin, one called שׁוּפמי from שׁפוּפם, and another
חוּפמי from חוּפם, are introduced; we must consequently hold מפּים to be
an error for שׁפם or שׁוּפם. And (2) the name עיר is most probably
identical with עירי in [Ch1 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007.md). The
peculiar forms of those names, viz., וחפּם שׁפם, seem to have arisen
from an improper comparison of them with וּלשׁפּים לחפּים in [Ch1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md), in which the fact was overlooked
that the Huppim and Shuppim of [Ch1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md) belong to the Manassites. Here,
therefore, two other families descended from the Benjamite Ir or Iri
would seem to be mentioned, which may easily be reconciled with the
purpose ([Ch1 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006).md) to mention none of
the Benjamites but the descendants of Bela, Becher, and Jediael. The
further statement, "Hushim, sons of Aher," is utterly enigmatical. The
name חשׁים is found in [Gen 46:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#023.md) as
that of Dan's only son, who, however, is called in [Num
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#042.md) שׁוּחם, and who founded the
family of the Shuhami. But as the names חוּשׁים and חשׁים are again met
with in [Ch1 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#008.md), [Ch1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#011.md) among the Benjamites, there is no
need to imagine any connection between our חשּׁם and that family.

The word אהר, alius, is not indeed found elsewhere as a nomen proprium,
but may notwithstanding be so here; when we might, notwithstanding the
want of the conjunction w, take the Hushim sons of Aher to be another
Benjamite family. In that case, certainly, the tribe of Dan would be
omitted from our chapter; but we must not allow that to lead us into
arbitrary hypotheses, as not only Dan but also Zebulun is omitted.

(Note: Bertheau's judgment in the matter is different. Starting from the
facts that חשׁים ([Gen 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027).md) is
called a son of Dan, and that further, in the enumeration of the tribes
in Gen 46 and Num 26, Dan follows after Benjamin; that in Gen 46 Dan
stands between Benjamin and Naphtali, and that in our chapter, in [Ch1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013.md), the sons of Naphtali follow
immediately; and that the closing words of this verse, "sons of Bilhah,"
can, according to [Gen 46:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#025.md), refer
only to Dan and Naphtali, and consequently presuppose that Dan or his
descendants have been mentioned in our passage, - he thinks there can be
no doubt that originally Danites were mentioned in our verse, and that
חשׁם was introduced as the son of Dan. Moreover, from the word אהר, "the
other," he draws the further inference that it may have been, according
to its meaning, the covert designation of a man whose proper name fear,
or dislike of some sort, prevented men from using, and was probably a
designation of the tribe of Dan, which set up its own worship, and so
separated itself from the congregation of Israel; cf. Judg. 17f. The
name is avoided, he says, in our chapter, in [Ch1
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md) and [Ch1
6:69](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#069.md), and is named only in [Ch1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#002.md) among the twelve tribes of Israel,
and in [Ch1 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#035.md). The conjecture,
therefore, is forced upon us, that אהר בּן חשּׁם, "Hushim the son of the
other," viz., of the other son of Bilhah, whose name he wished to pass
over in silence, stands for חשּׁם דן וּבני. The name Aher, then, had so
completely concealed the tribe of Dan, that later readers did not mark
the new commencement, notwithstanding the want of the conjunction, and
had no scruple in adding the well-known names of the Benjamites, שׁפם
and חפם, to the similarly-sounding חשׁם, though probably at first only
in the margin. This hypothesis has no solid foundation. The supposed
dislike to mention the name of Dan rests upon an erroneous imagination,
as is manifest from the thrice repeated mention of that name, not merely
in [Ch1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#002.md) and [Ch1
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#035.md), but also in [Ch1
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#022.md). The omission of the tribe of
Dan in [Ch1 6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md), [Ch1
6:69](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#069.md), is only the result of a
corruption of the text in these passages; for in [Ch1
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md) the words, "Ephraim and of the
tribe of Dan," and after [Ch1 6:69](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#069.md) a
whole verse, have been dropped out in the copying. In neither of these
verses can there by any idea of omitting the name Dan because of a
dislike to mention it, for in [Ch1
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md) the name Ephraim is lacking, and
in [Ch1 6:69](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#069.md) the names of two cities
are also omitted, where even Berth. cannot suppose any "dislike." When
Berth. quotes [Jdg 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030.md) in favour of
his concealment hypothesis, where under the Keri מנשׁה the name משׁה is
supposed to be concealed, he has forgotten that the opinion that in this
passage משׁה has been altered into מנשׁה from a foolish dislike, is one
of the rabbinic caprices, which we cannot attribute as a matter of
course to the authors of the biblical writings. With this groundless
suspicion falls of itself the attempt which he bases upon it "to solve
the enigma of our verse." If the words in question do really contain a
remark concerning the family of Dan, we must suppose, with Ewald (Gesch.
i. S. 242), that the text has become corrupt, several words having been
dropped out. Yet the בּלהה בּני at the end of [Ch1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013.md) is not sufficient to warrant such
a supposition. Had the register originally contained not only the sons
of Naphtali, but also the sons of Dan, so that בלהה בני would have to be
referred to both, the conj. ו could not have been omitted before נפתּלי
בּני. The want of this conjunction is, however, in conformity with the
whole plan of our register, in which all the tribes follow, one after
the other, without a conjunction; cf. [Ch1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md), [Ch1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md), [Ch1
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#030.md). ו is found only before אפרים
בּני, [Ch1 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md), because Ephraim and
Manasseh are closely connected, both continuing to form the one tribe of
Joseph. We must accordingly hold נף בני, [Ch1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013.md), without ו cop., to have been the
original reading, when the conjecture that בלהה בני includes also the
sons of Dan is at once disposed of.)

[1 Chronicles 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 7:13</span></span>

The sons of Naphtali. - Only the sons of Naphtali are named, the
families descended from them being passed over. The names correspond to
those in [Gen 46:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#024.md) and [Num
26:48](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#048.md)., except that there the first is
יחצאל, and the last שׁלּם instead of שׁלּוּם.

[1 Chronicles 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 7:14</span></span>

Families of the half-tribe of Manasseh. - The families of Manasseh which
dwelt in Gilead and Bashan have already been mentioned in [Ch1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023.md), [Ch1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#014.md). Our verses deal with the
families of this tribe which received their inheritance in Canaan, on
this side Jordan. These were, according to [Num
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030.md), [Num
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#034.md), and [Jos
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#002.md), six families, of which, however,
only two are here spoken of - Ashriel, [Ch1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md), and Shemidah, [Ch1
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#019.md); or perhaps three, if Abiezer,
[Ch1 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#018.md), be the same person as
Jeezer ([Num 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030).md), who is called
Abiezer in [Jos 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#002.md). The statements
of [Ch1 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md), [Ch1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md) are very obscure. At the head of
the register of the Manassites stands Ashriel, who, according to [Num
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#031.md), belonged to the sons of Gilead
the son of Manasseh and the grandson of Joseph (cf. [Gen
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#023).md), and founded one of the six
families of the cis-Jordanic Manassites. But the words which follow are
obscure; the words are וגו ילרה אשׁר, "whom his Aramaic concubine bore;
she bore Machir the father of Gilead." But since Ashriel, according to
this, was the great-grandson of Manasseh, while Machir was his son, the
relative clause can refer only to Manasseh, to whom his concubine bore
Machir. Movers and Berth. would therefore erase אשׂריאל, as a gloss
arising out of a doubling of the following יל אשר. By this expedient the
difficultly as to the connection of the relative clause is certainly got
rid of, but the obscurities of the following verse ([Ch1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015).md) are not thereby removed. The
analogy of the other registers in our chapter requires, rather, that
immediately after מנשּׁה בּני there should stand the name of a
descendant, - a fact which speaks strongly in favour of the authenticity
of אשׂריאל. It is therefore a much more probable suggestion, that after
the name אשׂריאל, some additional clause, such as בּן־מנשּׁה, has been
dropped, or regarded as superfluous by a copyist, and so omitted. To
such an omitted מנשׁה בן, the relative sentence, which gives more
details as to the descent of Ashriel, would be attacked in a simple and
natural manner, since it was known from [Num
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030.md). that Ashriel was descended from
Manasseh through Gilead.

[Ch1 7:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md)

[Ch1 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md) is literally, "And Machir
took a wife to Huppim and Shuppim, and the name of his sister was
Maachah, and the name of the second Zelophehad." According to [Ch1
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#016.md), on the contrary, Maachah is the
wife of Machir, and we should consequently expect to find in [Ch1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md) only the simple statement, "And
Machir took a wife whose name was Maachah." From the words מעכה אחתו
מעכה sdrow eh ולשׁפים לחפים no meaning which harmonizes with the context
can be obtained. Since ל אשּׁה לקח signifies "to take a wife for one"
(cf. [Jdg 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#002).md), we can only suppose
that by the names Huppim and Shuppim Machir's sons are meant, to whom
he, as their father, gave wives. But we cannot suppose that the sons of
Machir are referred to, for the birth of the sons is first mentioned in
[Ch1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#016.md). But we have found the names
חפם and שׁפם spoken of as descendants of Benjamin; and Bertheau
consequently conjectures that these names have been brought thence into
our verse by some gloss, and that the beginning of our verse originally
stood thus: המלכת אחתו ושׁם מעכם ושׁמה אשׁה לקח ומכיר לקח אשׁה ושׁם,
"And Machir took a wife whose name is Maachah, and the name of his
sister if Hammoleketh" (the last according to [Ch1
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#018).md). By this means we certainly
bring some meaning into the words; but we cannot venture to maintain
that this conjecture corresponds to the original text, but rather
incline to doubt it. For, in the first place, the following words, "And
the name of the second (is) Zelophehad," do not suit the proposed
reading. Berth. must here alter השּׁני into אהיו (the name of his
brother). But even after this alteration, the mention of the brother of
Machir is not suitable to the context; and moreover Zelophehad was not a
true brother, but only a nephew of Machir, the son of his brother
Hepher; cf. [Num 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#033.md); [Num
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md). And besides this, according to
the concluding formula, "These are the sons of Gilead, the son of
Machir, the son of Manasseh" ([Ch1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#017).md), we should expect to find in
[Ch1 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md), [Ch1
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#016.md), not merely sons or descendants
of Machir, but rather descendants of Gilead. We therefore hold the
statement of [Ch1 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md), "And the name
of the second if Zelophehad, and Zelophehad had (only) daughters," to be
correct and beyond criticism, and the first part of [Ch1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md) to be corrupt and defective; and
conjecture that a son of Gilead's was mentioned in it, to whose name the
words, "And the name of the second," etc., belonged. This son who was
mentioned in the text, which has been handed down to us only in a
defective state, was probably the Ashriel mentioned in [Ch1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md), a son of Gilead, whose descent
from Machir was given more in detail in the corrupt and consequently
meaningless first half of [Ch1 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md).
In [Ch1 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md), [Ch1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#017.md), other descendants of Machir by
his wife Maachah are enumerated, which favours the probable conjecture
that the wife whom Machir took, according to [Ch1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md), was different from Maachah, that
Machir had two wives, and that in [Ch1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md) originally the sons of the first
were enumerated, and in [Ch1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#016.md),
[Ch1 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#017.md), the sons of the second.
Peresh and Shelesh are mentioned only here. בּנין, "his sons" (that is,
the sons of the last-named, Shelesh), were Ulam and Rakem, names which
are also met with only here. The name בּדן is found in our Masoretic
text, [Sa1 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#011.md), as the name of a
judge, but probably בּרק should be read instead.

[Ch1 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#018.md)

A third branch of the descendants of Gilead were descended from Machir's
sister Hammoleketh, a name which the Vulgate has taken in an appellative
sense. Of her sons, Ishod, i.e., "man of splendour," is not elsewhere
mentioned. The name Abiezer occurs, [Jos
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#002.md), as that of the head of one of
the families of Manasseh. In [Num
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030.md), however, he is called Jeezer,
which is probably the original reading, and consequently our Abiezer is
different from that in [Jos 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#002.md).
Another circumstance which speaks strongly against the identification of
the two men is, that the family descended from Jeezer holds the first
place among the families of Manasseh, which is not at all consonant with
the position of the son of Machir's sister here mentioned. Of the family
of Abiezer came the judge Gideon, [Jdg
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#015.md). A daughter of Zelophehad is
called Mahlah in [Num 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#033.md); [Num
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md), but she is not the person here
mentioned.

[Ch1 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#019.md)

The sons of Shemida, the founder of the fourth family of the Manassites,
[Num 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#032.md). His four sons are nowhere
else referred to, for שׁכם, the founder of a family of the Manassites
([Num 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#031.md) and [Jos
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#002).md), is to be distinguished from the
Shechem of our verse; nor is there any greater reason to identify Likhi
with Helek, [Num 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030) (Berth..md), than
there is for connecting אניעם with נעם, the daughter of Zelophehad, [Num
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#033.md); [Jos
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#003.md).

[1 Chronicles 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 7:20</span></span>

The families of Ephraim. - [Ch1 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md).
Among the Ephraimites, the descendants of Shuthelah, the founder of one
of the chief families of this tribe, [Num
26:35](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#035.md), are traced down through six
generations to a later Shuthelah. The names ואלעד ועזר which follow בּנו
שׁוּתלח, "And his son Shuthelah," after which בּנו is wanting, are not
to be considered descendants of the second Shuthelah, but are heads of a
family co-ordinate with that of Shuthelah, or of two fathers'-houses
intimately connected with each other. These names are to be taken as a
continuation of the list of the sons of Ephraim, which commenced with
שׁוּתלח. The suffix in והרגוּם refers to both these names: "The men of
Gath, that were born in the land, smote Ezer and Elead." These "men born
in the land" Ewald and Bertheau take to be the Avvites, the aboriginal
inhabitants of that district of country, who had been extirpated by the
Philistines emigrating from Caphtor ([Deu
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023).md). But there is no sufficient
ground for this supposition; for no proof can be brought forward that
the Avvaeans (Avvites) had ever spread so far as Gath; and the
Philistines had taken possession of the south-west part of Canaan as
early as the time of Abraham, and consequently long before Ephraim's
birth. "The men of Gath who were born in the land" are rather the
Canaanite or Philistine inhabitants of Gath, as distinguished from the
Israelites, who had settled in Canaan only under Joshua. "For they (Ezer
and Elead) had come down to take away their cattle" (to plunder). The
older commentators assign this event to the time that Israel dwelt in
Egypt (Ewald, Gesch. i. S. 490), or even to the pre-Egyptian time. But
Bertheau has, in opposition to this, justly remarked that the narratives
of Genesis know nothing of a stay of the progenitors of the tribe of
Ephraim in the land of Palestine before the migration of Israel into
Egypt, for Ephraim was born in Egypt ([Gen
46:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#020).md). It would be more feasible to
refer it to the time of the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt, as it is
not impossible that the Israelites may have undertaken predatory
expeditions against Canaan from Goshen; but even this supposition is not
at all probable. Certainly, if in [Ch1
7:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#023.md) it were said, as Ewald thinks,
that Ephraim, after the mourning over the sons thus slain, became by his
wife the father of three other sons, from the last named of whom Joshua
was descended in the seventh generation, we should be compelled to refer
the expedition to the pre-Egyptian period. But the opinion that Rephah
and Resheph, [Ch1 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#025.md), were begotten
only after that misfortune has no foundation. Moreover, the statement
that Ephraim, after he was comforted for the loss of his slain sons,
went in unto his wife and begat a son, to whom he gave the name Beriah,
because he was born in misfortune in his house, does not at all
presuppose that the patriarch Ephraim was still alive when Ezer and
Elead were slain. Were that the case, the necessary result would of
course be, that this event could only be referred to the time when the
Israelites dwelt in Egypt. In opposition to this, Bertheau's remark that
the event in that case would be per se enigmatical, as we would rightly
have great hesitation in accepting the supposition of a war, or rather a
plundering expedition to seize upon cattle carried out by the
Ephraimites whilst they dwelt in Egypt, against the inhabitants of the
Philistine city of Gath, is certainly not all decisive, for we know far
too little about those times to be able to judge of the possibility or
probability of such an expedition.

The decision to which we must come as to this obscure matter depends, in
the first place, on how the words וגו ירדוּ כּי are to be understood;
whether we are to translate "for they had gone," or "when they had gone
down to fetch their cattle," i.e., to plunder. If we take the כּי par
partic. ration., for, because, we can only take the sons of Ephraim,
Ezer and Elead, for the subject of ירדוּ, and we must understand the
words to mean that they had gone down to carry off the cattle of the
Gathites. In that case, the event would fall in the time when the
Ephraimites dwelt in Canaan, and went down from Mount Ephraim into the
low-lying Gath, for a march out of Egypt into Canaan is irreconcilable
with the verb ירד. If, on the contrary, we translate ירדוּ כּי "when
they had gone down," we might then gather from the words that men of
Gath went down to Goshen, there to drive away the cattle of the
Ephraimites, in which case the Gathites may have slain the sons of
Ephraim when they were feeding their cattle and defending them against
the robbers. Many of the old commentators have so understood the words;
but we cannot hold this to be the correct interpretation, for it
deprives the words "those born in the land," which stand in apposition
to גת אנשׁי, of all meaning, since there can be absolutely no thought of
men of Gath born in Egypt. We therefore take the words to mean, that the
sons of Ephraim who are named in our verse attempted to drive away the
cattle of the Gathites, and were by them slain in the attempt. But how
can the statement that Ephraim after this unfortunate event begat
another son, Beriah, be reconciled with such a supposition, since the
patriarch Ephraim was dead long before the Israelites came forth out of
Egypt. Bertheau understands the begetting figuratively, of the whole of
the tribe of Ephraim, or of a small Ephraimite family, which at first
was not numbered with the others, into the number of the famous families
of this tribe. But this straining of the words by an allegorical
interpretation is not worthy of serious refutation, since it is
manifestly only a makeshift to get rid of the difficulty. The words,
"And Ephraim went in unto his wife, and she conceived and bare a son,"
are not to be interpreted allegorically, but must be taken in their
proper sense; and the solution of the enigma will be found in the name
Ephraim. If this be taken to denote the actual son of Joseph, then the
event is incomprehensible; but just as a descendant of Shuthelah in the
sixth generation was also called Shuthelah, so also might a descendant
of the patriarch Ephraim, living at a much later time, have received the
name of the progenitor of the tribe; and if we accept this supposition,
the event, with all its issues, is easily explained. If Ezer and Elead
went down from Mount Ephraim to Gath, they were not actual sons of
Ephraim, but merely later descendants; and their father, who mourned for
their death, was not Ephraim the son of Joseph, who was born in Egypt,
but an Ephraimite who lived after the Israelites had taken possession of
the land of Canaan, and who bore Ephraim's name. He may have mourned for
the death of his sons, and after he had been comforted for their loss,
may have gone in unto his wife, and have begotten a son with her, to
whom he gave the name Beriah, "because it was in misfortune in his
house," i.e., because this son was born when misfortune was in his
house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 7:24</span></span>

"And his daughter Sherah," the daughter of the above-mentioned Ephraim,
"built Beth-horon the nether and the upper," the present Beit-Ur-Fok and
Tachta (see on [Jos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010).md), "and
Uzzen-sherah," a place not elsewhere referred to, which she probably
founded, and which was called after her. The building of the two
Beth-horons is merely an enlarging and fortifying of these towns. Sherah
was probably an heiress, who had received these places as her
inheritance, and caused them to be enlarged by her family. In [Ch1
7:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#025.md) the ancestors of Joshua the
son of Nun, who brought Israel into the land of Canaan, are enumerated.
As the word בּנו is wanting after רשׁף, we must hold Rephah and Resheph
to be brothers, but we are not informed from which of the four
Ephraimite stocks enumerated in [Num
26:35](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#035.md). they were descended. "Telah his
son," Bertheau holds to be a son of Rephah. The name Tahan occurs in
[Num 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#035.md) as that of the founder of
one of the families of Ephraim; but he can hardly be identical with our
Tahan, who was probably a son of that Tahan from whom an Ephraimite
family descended. If this conjecture be correct, Joshua would be of the
family of Tahan.

Elishama the son of Ammihud was a contemporary of Moses, [Num

Ephraim, [Num 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#048.md); [Num

(Nun).

[1 Chronicles 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 7:28</span></span>

In [Ch1 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#028.md) and [Ch1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#029.md) the possessions and
dwelling-places of the tribe of Ephraim (and as we learn from the
superscription, [Ch1 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#029).md), also those
of West Jordan Manasseh, are given, but in a very general way; only the
chief places on the four sides being mentioned. Bethel, now Beitin, on
the frontier of the tribal domains of Benjamin and Ephraim ([Jos
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002.md); [Jos
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013).md), and assigned to the tribe of
Benjamin ([Jos 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#022).md), is here
mentioned as an Ephraimite city on the southern frontier of the
Ephraimite territory, as it belonged to the kingdom of the ten tribes;
whence we gather that this register was prepared after that kingdom had
come into existence. As to its position, see on [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md). Her daughters are the smaller
villages which belonged to Bethel. Naaran, without doubt the same place
which is called in [Jos 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007.md) נערתה
(with ה loc.), is the eastern frontier city lying to the north-east of
Jericho; see on [Jos 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007.md). "And
westward Gezer," according to [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md), lying between Beth-horon and the
sea (see on [Jos 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033).md), is the
frontier city on the south-west; and Shechem and Avvah (עוּה), with
their daughters, are places which mark the boundary on the north-west.
As to שׁכם, Shechem, the present Nabulus, see on [Jos
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007.md). Instead of עוּה, most of the
editions of the Bible agree with lxx and Vulg. and Chald. in having
עזּה, but not the Philistine Gaza: it is only an error of the
transcribers and printers, as all the more accurate MSS and the better
printed copies have עוה; see De Rossi, Variae Lectt. ad h. l. The
locality עוּה or עיּה is certainly met with nowhere else, but, if we may
judge by [Jos 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006.md) and [Jos
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#017.md), is to be sought not far from
Shechem in a north-western direction, perhaps on the site of the there
mentioned Michmethah, the position of which has, however, not yet been
ascertained.

[Ch1 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#029.md)

According to [Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md), the
Manassites had received the four cities here named, lying within the
territory of Issachar and Asher. This is attested also by על־ידי בני מ,
to the hands, i.e., in possession of the sons of Manasseh. As to its
position, see [Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md). These cities
formed the boundaries on the extreme north, of the dwellings "of the
sons of Joseph," i.e., of the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.

The sons and several families of Asher. - [Ch1
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#030.md). The names of the four sons of
Asher and that of their sister coincide with the statement of [Gen
46:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#017.md); but in [Num
26:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#044.md), on the contrary, the name
Ishuai does not occur among the families of Asher.

[Ch1 7:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#031.md)

The sons of Beriah, Heber and Malchiel, are also to be found in [Gen
46:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#017.md) and [Num
26:45](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#045.md) as the heads of two families;
but the further statement, "he (i.e., Malchiel) the father of
Birzavith," is found only here. How ברזות, the Kethibh, is to be
pronounced, cannot be with certainty determined. Gesen. in Thes. p. 239
makes it בּרזות, and considers the word to be the name of a woman;
Bertheau, on the contrary conjectures that it is a compound of בר = בּאר
and זית, "well of the olive-tree," and so the name of a place. In [Ch1
7:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#032.md) the descendants of Heber are
enumerated in three generations, which are mentioned nowhere else. In
[Ch1 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#032.md) we have four sons and one
daughter. The name יפלט is not to be connected with יפלטי, [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md), "because a family of Asher is
not to be sought for in the neighbourhood there referred to" (Berth.).
In [Ch1 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#033.md) we have four sons of
Japhlet, and in [Ch1 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#034.md) the sons of
his brother Shemer. It is somewhat remarkable that שׁומר, [Ch1
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#032.md), is called here שׁמר. אחי is not
an appellative, but a proper name, as the ו before the following name
shows; cf. another Ahi in [Ch1 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#015.md).
For יחבּה we should read וחבּה.

[Ch1 7:35-39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#035.md)

Descendants of Helem-in [Ch1 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#035.md)
sons, in [Ch1 7:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#036.md) grandsons.

As Helem is called אהיו, "his brother" (i.e., the brother of the Shemer
mentioned in [Ch1 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#034).md), הלם would
seem to be the third son of Heber, who is called in [Ch1
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#032.md) חותם. If so, one of the two names
must have resulted from an error in transcription; but it is now
impossible to determine which is the original and correct form of the
name. Eleven names are introduced as those of the sons of Zophah ([Ch1
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#036.md), [Ch1
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#037).md); and in [Ch1
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#038.md) we have, besides, three sons of
Jether (יתר), who is called in [Ch1
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#038.md) יתרן. In [Ch1
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#039.md) there follow three names, those
of the sons of Ulla; on which Bertheau rightly remarks, the whole
character of our enumeration would lead us to conjecture that עלּא had
already occurred among the preceding names, although we find neither
this name nor any similar one, with which it might be identified, in the
preceding list.

[Ch1 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#040.md)

[Ch1 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#040.md) contains a comprehensive
concluding statement as to the descendants of Asher: "All these (those
just mentioned by name) were heads of fathers'-houses, chosen valiant
heroes (חילים, as in [Ch1 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#005).md), chief
of the princes," Vulg. duces ducum, i.e., probably leaders of the larger
divisions of the army, under whom were other נשׂיאים. "And their
genealogical register is for service of the host in war," i.e., was
prepared with reference to the men capable of bearing arms, and had not,
like other registers, reference to the number of inhabitants of the
various localities; cf. [Ch1 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md). It
amounted to 26,000 men. According to [Num
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#041.md), Asher numbered 41,500, and
according to [Num 26:47](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#047.md), 53,000 men.
But we must observe that the number given in our verse is only that of
the men capable of bearing arms belonging to one of the greater families
of Asher, the family of Heber, of which alone a register had been
preserved till the time of the chronicler.
