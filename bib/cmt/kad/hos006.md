### [Hosea Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 6:1</span></span>

To this threat the prophet appends in the concluding strophe, both the
command to return to the Lord, and the promise that the Lord will raise
His smitten nation up again, and quicken them anew with His grace. The
separation of these three verses from the preceding one, by the division
of the chapters, is at variance with the close connection in the actual
contents, which is so perfectly obvious in the allusion made in the
words of [Hos 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md), "Come, and let us
return," to those of [Hos 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015.md), "I
will go, and return," and in טרף וירפּאנוּ ([Hos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001).md) to the similar words in [Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md) and [Hos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014.md). [Hos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md). "Come, and let us return to
Jehovah: for He has torn in pieces, and will heal us; He has smitten,
and will bind us up. [Hos 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002.md). He will
quicken us after two days; on the third He will raise us up, that we may
live before Him." The majority of commentators, following the example of
the Chald. and Septuagint, in which לאמר, λέγοντες, is interpolated
before לכוּ, have taken the first three verses as an appeal to return to
the Lord, addressed by the Israelites in exile to one another. But it
would be more simple, and more in harmony with the general style of
Hosea, which is characterized by rapid transitions, to take the words as
a call addressed by the prophet in the name of the exile. The promise in
v. 3 especially is far more suitable to a summons of this kind, than to
an appeal addressed by the people to one another. As the endurance of
punishment impels to seek the Lord ([Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015).md), so the motive to return to the
Lord is founded upon the knowledge of the fact that the Lord can, and
will, heal the wounds which He inflicts. The preterite târaph, as
compared with the future 'etrōph in [Hos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014.md), presupposes that the punishment
has already begun. The following יך is also a preterite with the Vav
consec. omitted. The Assyrian cannot heal ([Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013).md); but the Lord, who manifested
Himself as Israel's physician in the time of Moses ([Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026).md), and promised His people
healing in the future also ([Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039).md), surely can. The allusion in
the word ירפּאנוּ to this passage of Deuteronomy, is placed beyond all
doubt by [Hos 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002.md). The words, "He
revives after two days," etc., are merely a special application of the
general declaration, "I kill, and make alive" ([Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039).md), to the particular case in
hand. What the Lord there promises to all His people, He will also
fulfil upon the ten tribes of Israel. By the definition "after two
days," and "on the third day," the speedy and certain revival of Israel
is set before them. Two and three days are very short periods of time;
and the linking together of two numbers following one upon the other,
expresses the certainty of what is to take place within this space of
time, just as in the so-called numerical sayings in [Amo
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003.md); [Job
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md); [Pro
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016.md); [Pro
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md), [Pro
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018.md), in which the last and greater
number expresses the highest or utmost that is generally met with. הקים,
to raise the dead ([Job 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#012.md); [Psa
88:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md); [Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md), [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019).md). "That we may live before Him:"
i.e., under His sheltering protection and grace (cf. [Gen
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#018).md). The earlier Jewish and
Christian expositors have taken the numbers, "after two days, and on the
third day," chronologically. The Rabbins consequently suppose the
prophecy to refer either to the three captivities, the Egyptian, the
Babylonian, and the Roman, which has not ended yet; or to the three
periods of the temple of Solomon, of that of Zerubbabel, and of the one
to be erected by the Messiah. Many of the fathers, on the other hand,
and many of the early Lutheran commentators, have found in them a
prediction of the death of Christ and His resurrection on the third day.
Compare, for example, Calovii Bibl. illustr. ad h. l., where this
allusion is defended by a long series of undeniably weak arguments, and
where a fierce attack is made, not only upon Calvin, who understood
these words as "referring to the liberation of Israel from captivity,
and the restoration of the church after two days, i.e., in a very short
time;" but also upon Grotius, who found, in addition to the immediate
historical allusion to the Israelites, whom God would soon liberate from
their death-like misery after their conversion, a foretype, in
consequence of a special divine indication, of the time "within which
Christ would recover His life, and the church its hope." But any direct
allusion in the hope here uttered to the death and resurrection of
Christ, is proved to be untenable by the simple words and their context.
The words primarily hold out nothing more than the quickening of Israel
out of its death-like state of rejection from the face of God, and that
in a very short period after its conversion to the Lord. This
restoration to life cannot indeed be understood as referring to the
return of the exiles to their earthly fatherland; or, at all events, it
cannot be restricted to this. It does not occur till after the
conversion of Israel to the Lord its God, on the ground of faith in the
redemption effected through the atoning death of Christ, and His
resurrection from the grave; so that the words of the prophet may be
applied to this great fact in the history of salvation, but without its
being either directly or indirectly predicted. Even the resurrection of
the dead is not predicted, but simply the spiritual and moral
restoration of Israel to life, which no doubt has for its necessary
complement the reawakening of the physically dead. And, in this sense,
our passage may be reckoned among the prophetic utterances which contain
the germ of the hope of a life after death, as in [Isa
26:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md), and in the vision of Ezekiel
in [Eze 37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md).

That it did not refer to this in its primary sense, and so far as its
historical fulfilment was concerned, is evident from the following
verse. [Hos 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003.md). "Let us therefore
know, hunt after the knowledge of Jehovah. His rising is fixed like the
morning dawn, that He may come to us like the rain, and moisten the
earth like the latter rain." ונדעה נר corresponds to לכוּ ונשׁוּבה in
[Hos 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md). The object to נדעה is also
את־יהוה, and נדעה is merely strengthened by the addition of נרדּפה
לדּעת. The knowledge of Jehovah, which they would hunt after, i.e.,
strive zealously to obtain, is a practical knowledge, consisting in the
fulfilment of the divine commandments, and in growth in the love of God
with all the heart. This knowledge produces fruit. The Lord will rise
upon Israel like the morning dawn, and come down upon it like
fertilizing rain. מוצאו, His (i.e., Jehovah's) rising, is to be
explained from the figure of the dawn (for יצא applied to the rising of
the sun, see [Gen 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#023.md) and [Psa
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007).md). The dawn is mentioned instead
of the sun, as the herald of the dawning day of salvation (compare [Isa
58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008.md) and [Isa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002).md). This salvation which dawns when
the Lord appears, is represented in the last clause as a shower of rain
that fertilizes the land. יורה is hardly a kal participle, but rather
the imperfect hiphil in the sense of sprinkling. In [Deu
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014.md) (cf. [Deu
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#012.md) and [Lev
26:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004).md), the rain, or the early and
latter rain, is mentioned among the blessings which the Lord will bestow
upon His people, when they serve Him with all the heart and soul. This
promise the Lord will so fulfil in the case of His newly quickened
nation, that He Himself will refresh it like a fertilizing rain. This
will take place through the Messiah, as [Psa
72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006.md) and [Sa2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004.md) clearly show.

[Hosea 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 6:4</span></span>

The prophet's address commences afresh, as in [Hos
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#004.md), without any introduction, with
the denunciation of the incurability of the Israelites. [Hos
6:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md) form the first strophe. [Hos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md). "What shall I do to thee,
Ephraim? what shall I do to thee, Judah? for your love is like the
morning cloud, and like the dew which quickly passes away." That this
verse is not to be taken in connection with the preceding one, as it has
been by Luther ("how shall I do such good to thee?") and by many of the
earlier expositors, is evident from the substance of the verse itself.
For ‛âsâh, in the sense of doing good, is neither possible in itself,
nor reconcilable with the explanatory clause which follows. The chesed,
which is like the morning cloud, cannot be the grace of God; for a
morning cloud that quickly vanishes away, is, according to [Hos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003.md), a figurative representation of
that which is evanescent and perishable. The verse does not contain an
answer from Jehovah, "who neither receives nor repels the penitent,
because though they love God it is only with fickleness," as Hitzig
supposes; but rather the thought, that God has already tried all kinds
of punishment to bring the people back to fidelity to Himself, but all
in vain (cf. [Isa 1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005).md), because the
piety of Israel is as evanescent and transient as a morning cloud, which
is dispersed by the rising sun. Judging from the chesed in [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md), chasdekhem is to be understood as
referring to good-will towards other men flowing out of love to God (see
at [Hos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001).md).

[Hosea 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 6:5</span></span>

"Therefore have I hewn by the prophets, slain them by the words of my
mouth: and my judgment goeth forth as light." ‛Al-kēn, therefore,
because your love vanishes again and again, God must perpetually punish.
חצב ב does not mean to strike in among the prophets (Hitzig, after the
lxx, Syr., and others); but ב is instrumental, as in [Isa
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015.md), and châtsabh signifies to hew,
not merely to hew off, but to hew out or carve. The nebhı̄'ı̄m cannot be
false prophets, on account of the parallel "by the words of my mouth,"
but must be the true prophets. Through them God had hewed or carved the
nation, or, as Jerome and Luther render it, dolavi, i.e., worked it like
a piece of hard wood, in other words, had tried to improve it, and shape
it into a holy nation, answering to its true calling. "Slain by the
words of my mouth," which the prophets had spoken; i.e., not merely
caused death and destruction to be proclaimed to them, but suspended
judgment and death over them - as, for example, by Elijah - since there
dwells in the word of God the power to kill and to make alive (compare
[Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md); [Isa
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002).md). The last clause, according to
the Masoretic pointing and division of the words, does not yield any
appropriate meaning. משׁפּטיך could only be the judgments inflicted upon
the nation; but neither the singular suffix ך for כם ([Isa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004).md), nor אור יצא, with the singular
verb under the כ simil. omitted before אור, suits this explanation. For
אור יצא cannot mean "to go forth to the light;" nor can אור stand for
לאור. We must therefore regard the reading expressed by the ancient
versions,

(Note: The Vulgate in some of the ancient mss has also judicium meum,
instead of the judicia tua of the Sixtina. See Kennicott, Diss. gener.
ed. Bruns. p. 55ff.)

viz., משׁפּטי כאור ציצא, "my judgment goeth forth like light," as the
original one. My penal judgment went forth like the light (the sun);
i.e., the judgment inflicted upon the sinners was so obvious, so
conspicuous (clear as the sun), that every one ought to have observed it
and laid it to heart (cf. [Zep 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005).md).
The Masoretic division of the words probably arose simply from an
unsuitable reminiscence of [Psa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006.md).

[Hosea 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 6:6</span></span>

The reason why God was obliged to punish in this manner is given in the
following verses. [Hos 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md). "For I
take pleasure in love, and not in sacrifices; and in the knowledge of
God more than in burnt-offerings. [Hos
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#007.md). But they have transgressed the
covenant like Adam: there have they acted treacherously towards me."
Chesed is love to one's neighbour, manifesting itself in righteousness,
love which has its roots in the knowledge of God, and therefore is
connected with "the knowledge of God" here as in [Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md). For the thought itself, compare
the remarks on the similar declaration made by the prophet Samuel in
[Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md); and for parallels as to
the fact, see [Isa 1:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md); [Mic
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008.md); [Psa
40:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md), and [Psa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008.md)., in all which passages it is not
sacrifices in themselves, but simply the heartless sacrifices with which
the wicked fancied they could cover their sins, that are here rejected
as displeasing to God, and as abominations in His eyes. This is apparent
also from the antithesis in [Hos 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#007.md),
viz., the reproof of their transgression of the covenant. המּה (they)
are Israel and Judah, not the priests, whose sins are first referred to
in [Hos 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009.md). כּאדם, not "after the
manner of men," or "like ordinary men," - for this explanation would
only be admissible if המּה referred to the priests or prophets, or if a
contrast were drawn between the rulers and others, as in [Psa
82:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#007.md) - but "like Adam," who
transgressed the commandment of God, that he should not eat of the tree
of knowledge. This command was actually a covenant, which God made with
him, since the object of its was the preservation of Adam in vital
fellowship with the Lord, as was the case with the covenant that God
made with Israel (see [Job 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#033.md), and
Delitzsch's Commentary). The local expression "there," points to the
place where the faithless apostasy had occurred, as in [Psa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md). This is not more precisely
defined, but refers no doubt to Bethel as the scene of the idolatrous
worship. There is no foundation for the temporal rendering "then."

[Hosea 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 6:8</span></span>

The prophet cites a few examples in proof of this faithlessness in the
two following verses. [Hos 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md).
"Gilead is a city of evil-doers, trodden with blood. [Hos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009.md). And like the lurking of the men
of the gangs is the covenant of the priests; along the way they murder
even to Sichem: yea, they have committed infamy." Gilead is not a city,
for no such city is mentioned in the Old Testament, and its existence
cannot be proved from [Jdg 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#007.md) and
[Jdg 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md), any more than from [Gen
31:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#048.md),

(Note: The statement of the Onomast. (s.v. Γαλαάδ), that there is also a
city called Galaad, situated in the mountain which Galaad the son of
Machir, the son of Manasseh, took for the Amorite, and that of Jerome,
"from which mountain the city built in it derived its name, viz., that
which was taken," etc., furnish no proof of the existence of a city
called Gilead in the time of the Israelites; since Eusebius and Jerome
have merely inferred the existence of such a city from statements in the
Old Testament, more especially from the passage quoted by them just
before, viz., [Jer 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#006.md), Galaad tu
mihi initium Libani, taken in connection with [Num
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#039.md) -43, as the words "which Gilead
took" clearly prove. And with regard to the ruined cities Jelaad and
Jelaud, which are situated, according to Burckhardt (pp. 599, 600), upon
the mountain called Jebel Jelaad or Jelaud, it is not known that they
date from antiquity at all. Burckhardt gives no description of them, and
does not even appear to have visited the ruins.)

but it is the name of a district, as it is everywhere else; and here in
all probability it stands, as it very frequently does, for the whole of
the land of Israel to the east of the Jordan. Hosea calls Gilead a city
of evil-doers, as being a rendezvous for wicked men, to express the
thought that the whole land was as full of evil-doers as a city is of
men. עקבּה: a denom. of עקב, a footstep, signifying marked with traces,
full of traces of blood, which are certainly not to be understood as
referring to idolatrous sacrifices, as Schmieder imagines, but which
point to murder and bloodshed. It is quite as arbitrary, however, on the
part of Hitzig to connect it with the murder of Zechariah, or a massacre
associated with it, as it is on the part of Jerome and others to refer
it to the deeds of blood by which Jehu secured the throne. The bloody
deeds of Jehu took place in Jezreel and Samaria (2 Kings 9-10), and it
was only by a false interpretation of the epithet applied to Shallum,
viz., Ben-yâbhēsh, as signifying citizens of Jabesh, that Hitzig was
able to trace a connection between it and Gilead.

[Hosea 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 6:9</span></span>

In these crimes the priests take the lead. Like highway robbers, they
form themselves into gangs for the purpose of robbing travellers and
putting them to death. חכּי, so written instead of חכּה (Ewald, 16, b),
is an irregularly formed infinitive for חכּות (Ewald, 238, e). 'Ish
gedūdı̄m, a man of fighting-bands, i.e., in actual fact a highway robber,
who lies in wait for travellers.

(Note: The first hemistich has been entirely misunderstood by the lxx,
who have confounded כּחכּי with כּחך, and rendered the clause καὶ ἡ
Ἰσχύς ἀνδρὸς πειρατοῦ· ἔκρυψαν (חבו or חבאו instead of חבר) ἱερεῖς ὁδόν.
Jerome has also rendered כחכי strangely, et quasi fauces (כּחכּי)
virorum latronum particeps sacerdotum. Luther, on the other hand, has
caught the sense quite correctly on the whole, and simply rendered it
rather freely: "And the priests with their mobs are like footpads, who
lie in wait for people.")

The company (chebher, gang) of the priests resembled such a man. They
murder on the way (derekh, an adverbial accusative) to Sichem. Sichem, a
place on Mount Ephraim, between Ebal and Gerizim, the present Nablus
(see at [Jos 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007).md), was set apart as a
city of refuge and a Levitical city ([Jos
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007.md); [Jos
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#021).md); from which the more recent
commentators have inferred that priests from Sichem, using the
privileges of their city to cover crimes of their own, committed acts of
murder, either upon fugitives who were hurrying thither, and whom they
put to death at the command of the leading men who were ill-disposed
towards them (Ewald), or upon other travellers, either from avarice or
simple cruelty. But, apart from the fact that the Levitical cities are
here confounded with the priests' cities (for Sichem was only a
Levitical city, and not a priests' city at all), this conclusion is
founded upon the erroneous assumption, that the priests who were taken
by Jeroboam from the people generally, had special places of abode
assigned them, such as the law had assigned for the Levitical priests.
The way to Sichem is mentioned as a place of murders and bloody deeds,
because the road from Samaria the capital, and in fact from the northern
part of the kingdom generally, to Bethel the principal place of worship
belonging to the kingdom of the ten tribes, lay through this city.
Pilgrims to the feasts for the most part took this road; and the
priests, who were taken from the dregs of the people, appear to have
lain in wait for them, either to rob, or, in case of resistance, to
murder. The following כּי carries it still higher, and adds another
crime to the murderous deeds. Zimmâh most probably refers to an
unnatural crime, as in [Lev 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017.md);
[Lev 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#029.md).

Thus does Israel heap up abomination upon abomination. [Hos
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#010.md). "In the house of Israel I saw a
horrible thing: there Ephraim practises whoredom: Israel has defiled
itself." The house of Israel is the kingdom of the ten tribes.
שׁערוּריה, a horrible thing, signifies abominations and crimes of every
kind. In the second hemistich, zenūth, i.e., spiritual and literal
whoredom, is singled out as the principal sin. Ephraim is not the name
of a tribe here, as Simson supposes, but is synonymous with the parallel
Israel.

[Hosea 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 6:11</span></span>

In conclusion, Judah is mentioned again, that it may not regard itself
as better or less culpable. [Hos 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md).
"Also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed for thee, when I turn the
imprisonment of my people." Judah stands at the head as an absolute
noun, and is then defined by the following לך. The subject to shâth
cannot be either Israel or Jehovah. The first, which Hitzig adopts,
"Israel has prepared a harvest for thee," does not supply a thought at
all in harmony with the connection; and the second is precluded by the
fact that Jehovah Himself is the speaker. Shâth is used here in a
passive sense, as in [Job 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011.md) (cf.
Ges. 137, 3\*). קציר, harvest, is a figurative term for the judgment, as
in [Joe 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013.md), [Jer
51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033.md). As Judah has sinned as well as
Israel, it cannot escape the punishment (cf. [Hos
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md), [Hos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014).md). שׁוּב שׁבוּת never means to
bring back the captives; but in every passage in which it occurs it
simply means to turn the captivity, and that in the figurative sense of
restitutio in integrum (see at [Deu
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003).md). ‛Ammı̄, my people, i.e., the
people of Jehovah, is not Israel of the ten tribes, but the covenant
nation as a whole. Consequently shebhūth ‛ammı̄ is the misery into which
Israel (of the twelve tribes) had been brought, through its falling away
from God, not the Assyrian or Babylonian exile, but the misery brought
about by the sins of the people. God could only avert this by means of
judgments, through which the ungodly were destroyed and the penitent
converted. Consequently the following is the thought which we obtain
from the verse: "When God shall come to punish, that He may root out
ungodliness, and bring back His people to their true destination, Judah
will also be visited with the judgment." We must not only reject the
explanation adopted by Rosenmller, Maurer, and Umbreit, "when Israel
shall have received its chastisement, and be once more received and
restored by the gracious God, the richly merited punishment shall come
upon Judah also," but that of Schmieder as well, who understands by the
"harvest" a harvest of joy. They are both founded upon the false
interpretation of shūbh shebhūth, as signifying the bringing back of the
captives; and in the first there is the arbitrary limitation of ‛ammı̄ to
the ten tribes. Our verse says nothing as to the question when and how
God will turn the captivity of the people and punish Judah; this must be
determined from other passages, which announce the driving into exile of
both Israel and Judah, and the eventual restoration of those who are
converted to the Lord their God. The complete turning of the captivity
of the covenant nation will not take place till Israel as a nation shall
be converted to Christ its Saviour.
