### [Jeremiah Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 25:1</span></span>

The prediction of this chapter is introduced by a full heading, which
details with sufficient precision the time of its composition. [Jer
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001). "The word that came (befell.md) to
(על for אל) Jeremiah concerning the whole people of Judah, in the fourth
year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that is, the first
year of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon; [Jer
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#002.md). Which Jeremiah the prophet spake
to the whole people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
saying." - All the discourses of Jeremiah delivered before this time
contain either no dates at all, or only very general ones, such as [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md) : In the days of Josiah, or: at
the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim ([Jer
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001).md). And it is only some of those of
the following period that are so completely dated, as [Jer
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md); [Jer
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001.md); [Jer
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001.md); [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md), etc. The present heading is in
this further respect peculiar, that besides the year of the king of
Judah's reign, we are also told that of the king of Babylon. This is
suggested by the contents of this prediction, in which the people are
told of the near approach of the judgment which Nebuchadnezzar is to
execute on Judah and on all the surrounding nations far and near, until
after seventy years judgment fall on Babylon itself. The fourth year of
Jehoiakim is accordingly a notable turning-point for the kingdom of
Judah. It is called the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
because then, at the command of his old and decrepit father
Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar had undertaken the conduct of the war
against Pharaoh Necho of Egypt, who had penetrated as far as the
Euphrates. At Carchemish he defeated Necho ([Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002).md), and in the same year he came in
pursuit of the fleeing Egyptians to Judah, took Jerusalem, and made King
Jehoiakim tributary. With the first taking of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, i.e., in 606 b.c.,
begins the seventy years' Babylonian bondage or exile of Judah, foretold
by Jeremiah in [Jer 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md) of the
present chapter. Nebuchadnezzar was then only commander of his father's
armies; but he is here, and in [Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md); [Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md), called king of Babylon, because,
equipped with kingly authority, he dictated to the Jews, and treated
them as if he had been really king. Not till the following year, when he
was at the head of his army in Farther Asia, did his father Nabopolassar
die; whereupon he hastened to Babylon to mount the throne; see on [Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md) and 1 Kings 24:1. - In [Jer
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#002.md) it is again specified that
Jeremiah spoke the word of that Lord that came to him to the whole
people and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem (על for אל again). There
is no cogent reason for doubting, as Graf does, the correctness of these
dates. [Jer 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#005.md) tells us that
Jeremiah in the same year caused Baruch to write down the prophecies he
had hitherto delivered, in order to read them to the people assembled in
the temple, and this because he himself was imprisoned; but it does not
follow from this, that at the time of receiving this prophecy he was
prevented from going into the temple. The occurrence of Jer 36 falls in
any case into a later time of Jehoiakim's fourth year than the present
chapter. Ew., too, finds it very probable that the discourse of this
chapter was, in substance at least, publicly delivered. The contents of
it tell strongly in favour of this view.

It falls into three parts. In the first, [Jer
25:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003.md), the people of Judah are told
that he (Jeremiah) has for twenty-three years long unceasingly preached
the word of the Lord to the people with a view to their repentance,
without Judah's having paid any heed to his sayings, or to the
exhortations of the other prophets, so that now all the kings of the
north, headed by Nebuchadnezzar, will come against Judah and the
surrounding nations, will plunder everything, and make these lands
tributary to the king of Babylon; and then, [Jer
25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md), that after seventy years
judgment will come on the king of Babylon and his land. In the second
part, [Jer 25:15-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md), Jeremiah receives
the cup of the Lord's wrath, to give it to all the people to drink,
beginning with Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, proceeding to the
Egyptians and the nationalities in the west and east as far as Elam and
Media, and concluding with the king of Babylon. Then in the third part,
vv. 30-38, judgment to come upon all peoples is set forth in plain
statement. - The first part of this discourse would have failed of its
effect if Jeremiah had only composed it in writing, and had not
delivered it publicly before the people, in its main substance at least.
And the two other parts are so closely bound up with the first, that
they cannot be separated from it. The judgment made to pass on Judah by
Nebuchadnezzar is only the beginning of the judgment which is to pass on
one nation after another, until it culminates in judgment upon the whole
world. As to the import of the judgment of the Babylonian exile, cf. the
remm. in the Comm. on Daniel, Introd. 2. The announcement of the
judgment, whose beginning was now at hand, was of the highest importance
for Judah. Even the proclamations concerning the other peoples were
designed to take effect in the first instance on the covenant people,
that so they might learn to fear the Lord their God as the Lord of the
whole world and as the Ruler of all the peoples, who by judgment is
preparing the way for and advancing the salvation of the whole world.
The ungodly were, by the warning of what was to come on all flesh, to be
terrified out of their security and led to turn to God; while by a
knowledge beforehand of the coming affliction and the time it was
appointed to endure, the God-fearing would be strengthened with
confidence in the power and grace of the Lord, so that they might bear
calamity with patience and self-devotion as a chastisement necessary to
their well-being, without taking false views of God's covenant promises
or being overwhelmed by their distresses.

[Jeremiah 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 25:3</span></span>

The seventy years' Chaldean bondage of Judah and the peoples. - [Jer
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003.md). "From the thirteenth year of
Josiah, son of Amon king of Judah, unto this day, these three and twenty
years, came the word of Jahveh to me, and I spake to you, from early
morn onwards speaking, but ye hearkened not. [Jer
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#004.md). And Jahveh sent to you all His
servants, the prophets, from early morning on sending them, but ye
hearkened not, and inclined not your ear to hear. [Jer
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#005.md). They said: Turn ye now each from
his evil way and from the evil of your doings, so shall ye abide in the
land which Jahveh hath given to your fathers from everlasting to
everlasting. [Jer 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#006.md). And go not
after other gods, to serve them and to worship them, that ye provoke me
not with the work of your hands, and that I do you no evil. [Jer
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#007.md). But ye hearkened not to me, to
provoke me by the work of your hands, to your own hurt. [Jer
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#008.md). Therefore thus hath said Jahveh
of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words, [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md). Behold, I send and take all the
families of the north, saith Jahveh, and to Nebuchadrezzar my servant (I
send), and bring them upon this land, and upon its inhabitants, and upon
all these peoples round about, and ban them, and make them an
astonishment and a derision and everlasting desolations, [Jer
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md). And destroy from among them the
voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the
mill and the light of the lamp. [Jer
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md). And this land shall become a
desert, a desolation, and these peoples shall serve the king of Babylon
seventy years."

The very beginning of this discourse points to the great crisis in the
fortunes of Judah. Jeremiah recalls into the memory of the people not
merely the whole time of his own labours hitherto, but also the labours
of many other prophets, who, like himself, have unremittingly preached
repentance to the people, called on them to forsake idolatry and their
evil ways, and to return to the God of their fathers - but in vain ([Jer
25:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003).md). The 23 years, from the 13th
of Josiah till the 4th of Jehoiakim, are thus made up: 19 years of
Josiah and 4 years of Jehoiakim, including the 3 months' reign of
Jehoahaz. The form אשׁכּים might be an Aramaism; but it is more probably
a clerical error, since we have השׁכּם everywhere else; cf. [Jer
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#004.md), [Jer
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013.md); [Jer
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#014.md), etc., and Olsh. Gramm. 191, g.
For syntactical reasons it cannot be 1st pers. imperf., as Hitz. thinks
it is. On the significance of this infin. abs. see on [Jer
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013.md). As to the thought of [Jer
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#004.md) cf. [Jer
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025.md). and [Jer
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007.md). לאמר introduces the contents of
the discourses of Jeremiah and the other prophets, though formally it is
connected with ושׁלח, [Jer 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#004.md). As to
the fact, cf. [Jer 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015.md). וּשׁבוּ, so
shall ye dwell, cf. [Jer 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#007.md). - With
[Jer 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#006.md) cf. [Jer
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#006.md); [Jer
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016.md), etc. (ארע, imperf. Hiph. from
רעע). הכעסוּני cannot be the reading of its Chet., for the 3rd person
will not do. The ו seems to have found its way in by an error in writing
and the Keri to be the proper reading, since למען is construed with the
infinitive.

[Jeremiah 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 25:8</span></span>

For this obstinate resistance the Lord will cause the nations of the
north, under Nebuchadrezzar's leadership, to come and lay Judah waste.
"All the families of the north" points back to all the tribes of the
kingdoms of the north, [Jer 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014.md). ואל
נבוך cannot be joined with "and take," but must depend from שׁלח in such
a way that that verb is again repeated in thought. Ew. proposes to read
ואת according to some codd., especially as Syr., Chald., Vulg. have
rendered by an accusative. Against this Graf has justly objected, that
then Nebuchadnezzar would be merely mentioned by the way as in addition
to the various races, whereas it is he that brings these races and is
the instrument of destruction in God's hand. Ew.'s reading is therefore
to be unhesitatingly rejected. No valid reason appears for pronouncing
the words: and to Nebuchadrezzar...my servant, to be a later
interpolation (Hitz., Gr.) because they are not in the lxx. There is
prominence given to Nebuchadnezzar by the very change of the
construction, another "send" requiring to be repeated before "to
Nebuchadrezzar." God calls Nebuchadnezzar His servant, as the executor
of His will on Judah, cf. [Jer 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md)
and [Jer 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010.md). The "them" in "and
bring them" refers to Nebuchadnezzar and the races of the north. "This
land" is Judah, the הזּאת being δεικτικῶς; so too the corresponding
האלּה, "all these peoples round about;" so that we need have no doubt of
the genuineness of the demonstrative. The peoples meant are those found
about Judah, that are specified in [Jer
25:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#019.md). החרמתּים, used frequently in
Deuteronomy and Joshua for the extirpation of the Canaanites, is used by
Jeremiah, besides here, only in the prophecy against Babylon, [Jer
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021.md), [Jer
50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md); [Jer
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#003.md). With לשׁמּה ולשׁרקה cf. [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md); [Jer
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md); the words cannot be used of the
peoples, but of the countries, which have been comprehended in the
mention of the peoples. With "everlasting desolations," cf. [Jer
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md), [Isa
58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012.md); [Isa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004.md). - With [Jer
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md) cf. [Jer
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009.md); [Jer
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034.md). But here the thought is
strengthened by the addition: the sound of the mill and the light of the
lamp. Not merely every sound of joyfulness shall vanish, but even every
sign of life, such as could make known the presence of inhabitants.

[Jeremiah 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 25:11</span></span>

The land of Judah shall be made waste and desolate, and these peoples
shall serve the king of Babylon for seventy years. The time indicated
appertains to both clauses. "This land" is not, with Ng., to be referred
to the countries inhabited by all the peoples mentioned in [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md), but, as in [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md), to be understood of the land of
Judah; and "all these peoples" are those who dwelt around Judah. The
meaning is unquestionably, that Judah and the countries of the adjoining
peoples shall lie waste, and that Judah and these peoples shall serve
the king of Babylon; but the thought is so distributed amongst the
parallel members of the verse, that the desolation is predicated of
Judah only, the serving only of the peoples - it being necessary to
complete each of the parallel members from the other.

The term of seventy years mentioned is not a so-called round number, but
a chronologically exact prediction of the duration of Chaldean supremacy
over Judah. So the number is understood in [Ch2
36:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021.md); so too by the prophet
Daniel, when, [Dan 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md), in the first
year of the Median king Darius, he took note of the seventy years which
God, according to the prophecy of Jeremiah, would accomplish for the
desolation of Jerusalem. The seventy years may be reckoned
chronologically. From the 4th year of Jehoiakim, i.e., 606 b.c., till
the 1st year of the sole supremacy of Cyrus over Babylon, i.e., 536
b.c., gives a period of 70 years. This number is arrived at by means of
the dates given by profane authors as well as those of the historians of
Scripture. Nebuchadnezzar reigned 43 years, his son Evil-Merodach 2
years, Neriglissor 4 years, Labrosoarchad (according to Berosus) 9
months, and Naboned 17 years (43 + 2 + 4 + 17 years and 9 months are 66
years and 9 months). Add to this 1 year - that namely which elapsed
between the time when Jerusalem was first taken by Nebuchadnezzar, and
the death of Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar's accession - add further
the 2 years of the reign of Darius the Mede (see on [Dan
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001).md), and we have 69 3/4 years. With
this the biblical accounts also agree. Of Jehoiakim's reign these give 7
years (from his 4th till his 11th year), for Jehoiachin's 3 months, for
the captivity of Jehoiachin in Babylon until the accession of
Evil-Merodach 37 years (see [Kg2
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md), according to which
Evil-Merodach, when he became king, set Jehoiachin at liberty on the
27th day of the 12th months, in the 37th year after he had been carried
away). Thus, till the beginning of Evil-Merodach's reign, we would have
44 years and 3 months to reckon, thence till the fall of the Babylonian
empire 23 years and 9 months, and 2 years of Darius the Mede, i.e., in
all 70 years complete. - But although this number corresponds so exactly
with history, it is less its arithmetical value that is of account in
Jeremiah; it is rather its symbolical significance as the number of
perfection for God's works. This significance lies in the contrast of
seven, as the characteristic number for works of God, with ten, the
number that marks earthly completeness; and hereby prophecy makes good
its distinguishing character as contrasted with soothsaying, or the
prediction of contingent matters. The symbolical value of the number
comes clearly out in the following verses, where the fall of Babylon is
announced to come in seventy years, although it took place two years
earlier.

[Jeremiah 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 25:12</span></span>

The overthrow of the king of Babylon's sovereignty. - [Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md). "But when seventy years are
accomplished, I will visit their iniquity upon the king of Babylon and
upon that people, saith Jahveh, and upon the land of the Chaldeans, and
will make it everlasting desolations. [Jer
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md). And I bring upon that land all
my words which I have spoken concerning it, all that is written in this
book, that Jeremiah hath prophesied concerning all peoples. [Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md). For of them also shall many
nations and great kings serve themselves, and I will requite them
according to their doing and according to the work of their hands."

The punishment or visitation of its iniquity upon Babylon was executed
when the city was taken, after a long and difficult siege, by the allied
Medes and Persians under Cyrus' command. This was in b.c. 538, just 68
years after Jerusalem was taken by Nebuchadnezzar for the first time.
From the time of the fall of Babylon the sovereignty passed to the Medes
and Persians; so that the dominion of Babylon over Judah and the
surrounding nations, taken exactly, last 68 years, for which the
symbolically significant number 70 is used. The Masoretes have changed
the Chet. הבאתי into הבאתי (Keri), because the latter is the usual form
and is that which alone elsewhere occurs in Jeremiah, cf. [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014.md); [Jer
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#031.md); [Jer
49:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#036.md).; whereas in [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md) they have pointed הבאתים, because
this form is found in [Isa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md); [Eze
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013.md), and [Neh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#009.md). - The second half of the [Jer
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md), from "all that is written"
onwards, was not, of course, spoken by Jeremiah to the people, but was
first added to explain "all my words," etc., when his prophecies were
written down and published.

[Jeremiah 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 25:14</span></span>

The perfect עבדוּ is to be regarded as a prophetic present. עבד בּ,
impose labour, servitude on one, cf. [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013.md), i.e., reduce one to servitude.
גּם המּה is an emphatic repetition of the pronoun בּם, cf. Gesen. 121,
3. Upon them, too (the Chaldeans), shall many peoples and great kings
impose service, i.e., they shall make the Chaldeans bondsmen, reduce
them to subjection. With "I will requite them," cf. [Jer
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md); [Jer
51:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#024.md), where this idea is repeatedly
expressed.

(Note: [Jer 25:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md) are pronounced by
Hitz., Ew., Graf to be spurious and interpolated; but Hitz. excepts the
second half of [Jer 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md), and
proposes to set it immediately after the first half of [Jer
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md). Their main argument is the
dogmatic prejudice, that in the fourth year of Jehoiakim Jeremiah could
not have foretold the fall of Babylon after seventy years' domination.
The years foretold, says Hitz., "would coincide by all but two years,
or, if Darius the Mede be a historical person, perhaps quite entirely.
Such correspondence between history and prophecy would be a surprising
accident, or else Jeremiah must have known beforehand the number of
years during which the subjection to Babylon would last." Now the
seventy years of Babylon's sovereignty are mentioned against in [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md), where Jeremiah promises the
exiles that after seventy years they shall return to their native land,
and no doubt is thrown by the above-mentioned critics on this statement;
but there the seventy years are said to be a so-called round number,
because that prophecy was composed nine years later than the present
one. But on the other hand, almost all comm. have remarked that the
utterance of [Jer 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md) : "when as for
Babylon seventy years are accomplished, will I visit you," points
directly back to the prophecy before us (25), and so gives a testimony
to the genuineness of our 11th verse. And thus at the same time the
assertion is disposed of, that in [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md) the years given are a round
number; for it is not there said that seventy years will be accomplished
from the time of that letter addressed by the prophet to those in
Babylon, but the terminus a quo of the seventy years is assumed as known
already from the present twenty-fifth chap. - The other arguments
brought forward by Hitz. against the genuineness of the verse have
already been pronounced inconclusive by Ng. Nevertheless Ng. himself
asserts the spuriousness, not indeed of [Jer
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md) (the seventy years' duration of
Judah's Babylonian bondage), but of [Jer
25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md), and on the following
grounds: - 1. Although in [Jer 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md),
and below in [Jer 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md), it is
indicated that Babylon itself will not be left untouched by the judgment
of the Lord, yet (he says) it is incredible that in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim the prophet could have spoken of the fall of Babylon in such a
full and emphatic manner as is the case in [Jer
25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md). But no obvious reason can be
discovered why this should be incredible. For though in [Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md) Jeremiah makes use of the name
Sheshach for Babylon, it does not hence follow that at that moment he
desired to speak of it only in a disguised manner. In the statement that
the Jews should serve the king of Babylon seventy years, it was surely
clearly enough implied that after the seventy years Babylon's
sovereignty should come to an end. Still less had Jeremiah occasion to
fear that the announcement of the fall of Babylon after seventy years
would confirm the Jews in their defiant determination not to be
tributary to Babylon. The prophets of the Lord did not suffer themselves
to be regulated in their prophesyings by such reasons of human
expediency. - 2. Of more weight are his other two arguments. [Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md) and [Jer
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md) presume the existence of the
prophecy against Babylon, Jer 50 and 51, which was not composed till the
fourth year of Zedekiah; and the second half of [Jer
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md) presumes the existence of the
other prophecies against the nations, and that too as a ספר. And
although the greater number of these prophecies are older than the time
of the battle at Carchemish, yet we may see (says Ng.) from the relation
of apposition in which the second half of [Jer
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md) stands to the first, that here
that Sepher against the peoples is meant in which the prophecy against
Babylon was already contained. But from all this nothing further follows
than that the words: "all that is written in this book and that Jeremiah
prophesied against the peoples," were not uttered by Jeremiah in the
fourth year of Jehoiakim, but were first appended at the editing of the
prophecies or the writing of them down in the book which has come down
to us. The demonstrative הזּה does by no means show that he who wrote it
regarded the present passage, namely Jer 25, as belonging to the Sepher
against the peoples, or that the prophecies against the peoples must
have stood in immediate connection with Jer 25. It only shows that the
prophecies against the peoples too were found in the book which
contained Jer 25. Again, it is true that the first half of [Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md) occurs again somewhat literally
in [Jer 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md); but we do not at all see
in this reliable evidence that Jeremiah could not have written [Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md). Ng. founds this conclusion
mainly on the allegation that the perf. עבדוּ is wrong, whereas in [Jer
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md) it is joined regularly by ו
consec. to the indication of time which precedes. But the perfect is
here to be regarded as the prophetic present, marking the future as
already accomplished in the divine counsel; just as in [Jer
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md) the categorical נתתּי represents
as accomplished that which in reality yet awaited its fulfilment.
Accordingly we regard none of these arguments as conclusive. On the
other hand, the fact that the Alexandrian translators have rendered [Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md) and [Jer
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md), and have made the last clause
of [Jer 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md) the heading to the
oracles against the peoples, furnishes an unexceptionable testimony to
the genuineness of all three verses. Nor is this testimony weakened by
the omission in that translation of [Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md); for this verse could not but be
omitted when the last clause of [Jer
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md) had been taken as a heading,
since the contents of [Jer 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md) were
incompatible with that view.)

The cup of God's fury. - [Jer 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md).
"For thus hath Jahveh, the God of Israel, said to me: Take this cup of
the wine of fury at my hand, and give it to drink to all the peoples to
whom I send thee, [Jer 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md). That
they may drink, and reel, and be mad, because of the sword that I send
amongst them. [Jer 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#017.md). And I took
the cup at the hand of Jahveh, and made all the peoples drink it to whom
Jahveh had sent me: [Jer 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md).
Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and her kings, her princes, to make
them a desolation and an astonishment, an hissing and a curse, as it is
this day; [Jer 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#019.md). Pharaoh the king
of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md). And all the mixed races and all
the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the
Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; [Jer
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#021.md). Edom, and Moab, and the sons of
Ammon; [Jer 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022.md). All the kings of
Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the islands beyond the
sea; [Jer 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md). Dedan, and Tema, and
Buz, and all with the corners of their hair polled; [Jer
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024.md). And all the kings of Arabia,
and all the kings of the mixed races that dwell in the wilderness; [Jer
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#025.md). All the kings of Zimri, and all
the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; [Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md). And all the kings of the north,
near and far, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which
are upon the face of the earth; and the king of Sheshach shall drink
after them. [Jer 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027.md). And say to
them: Thus hath Jahveh, the God of Israel, said: Drink and be drunken,
and spue, and fall and rise not up again, because of the sword which I
send among you. [Jer 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#028.md). And if it
be that they refuse to take the cup out of thine hand to drink, then say
to them: Thus hath Jahveh of hosts said: Drink ye shall. [Jer
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029.md). For, behold, on the city upon
which my name is named I begin to bring evil, and ye think to go
unpunished? Ye shall not go unpunished; for I call the sword against all
inhabitants of the earth, saith Jahveh of hosts."

To illustrate more fully the threatening against Judah and all peoples,
[Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md)., the judgment the Lord is
about to execute on all the world is set forth under the similitude of a
flagon filled with wrath, which the prophet is to hand to all the kings
and peoples, one after another, and which he does give them to drink.
The symbolical action imposed upon the prophet and, acc. to [Jer
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#017.md), performed by him, serves to
give emphasis to the threatening, and is therefore introduced by כּי; of
which Graf erroneously affirms that it conveys a meaning only when [Jer
25:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md) are omitted. Giving the
peoples to drink of the cup of wrath is a figure not uncommon with the
prophets for divine chastisements to be inflicted; cf. [Jer
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012.md); [Jer
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md); [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md), [Isa
51:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#022.md); [Eze
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#031.md)., [Hab
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015.md); [Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005.md); [Psa
75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md), etc. The cup of wine which is
wrath (fury). החמּה is an explanatory apposition to "wine." The wine
with which the cup is filled is the wrath of God. הזּאת belongs to
כּוּס, which is fem., cf. [Eze 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#032.md),
[Eze 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#034.md); [Lam
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md), whereas אותו belongs to the wine
which is wrath. In [Jer 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md), where
the purpose with which the cup of wrath is to be presented is given,
figure is exchanged for fact: they shall reel and become mad because of
the sword which the Lord sends amidst them. To reel, sway to and fro,
like drunken men. התהלל, demean oneself insanely, be mad. The sword as a
weapon of war stands often for war, and the thought is: war with its
horrors will stupefy the peoples, so that they perish helpless and
powerless.

[Jeremiah 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 25:17</span></span>

This duty imposed by the Lord Jeremiah performs; he takes the cup and
makes all peoples drink it. Here the question has been suggested, how
Jeremiah performed this commission: whether he made journeys to the
various kings and peoples, or, as J. D. Mich. thought, gave the cup to
ambassadors, who were perhaps then in Jerusalem. This question is the
result of an imperfect understanding of the case. The prophet does not
receive from god a flagon filled with wine which he is to give, as a
symbol of divine wrath, to the kings and peoples; he receives a cup
filled with the wrath of God, which is to intoxicate those that drink of
it. As the wrath of God is no essence that may be drunk by the bodily
act, so manifestly the cup is no material cup, and the drinking of it no
act of the outer, physical reality. The whole action is accordingly only
emblematical of a real work of God wrought on kings and peoples, and is
performed by Jeremiah when he announces what he is commanded. And the
announcement he accomplished not by travelling to each of the nations
named, but by declaring to the king and his princes in Jerusalem the
divine decree of judgment.

The enumeration begins with Judah, [Jer
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md), on which first judgment is to
come. Along with it are named Jerusalem, the capital, and the other
cities, and then the kings and princes; whereas in what follows, for the
most part only the kings, or, alternating with them, the peoples, are
mentioned, to show that kings and peoples alike must fall before the
coming judgment. The plural "kings of Judah" is used as in [Jer
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003.md). The consequence of the judgment:
to make them a desolation, etc., runs as in [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md), [Jer
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md), [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md); [Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md). כּיּום הזּה has here the force:
as is now about to happen.

[Jeremiah 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 25:19</span></span>

The enumeration of the heathen nations begins with Egypt and goes
northwards, the peoples dwelling to the east and west of Judah being
ranged alongside one another. First we have in [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md) the races of Arabia and
Philistia that bordered on Egypt to the east and west; and then in [Jer
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#021.md) the Edomites, Moabites, and
Ammonites to the east, and, [Jer
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022.md), the Phoenicians with their
colonies to the west. Next we have the Arabian tribes of the desert
extending eastwards from Palestine to the Euphrates ([Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md), [Jer
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024).md); then the Elamites and Medes in
the distant east ([Jer 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#025).md), the
near and distant kings of the north, and all kingdoms upon earth; last
of all the king of Babylon ([Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).md). כּל־הערב, lxx: πάντας τοῦς
συμμίκτους, and Jerome: cunctusque qui non est Aegyptius, sed in ejus
regionibus commoratur. The word means originally a mixed multitude of
different races that attach themselves to one people and dwell as
strangers amongst them; cf. [Exo 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038.md)
and [Neh 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#003.md). Here it is races that
in part dwelt on the borders of Egypt and were in subjection to that
people. It is rendered accordingly "vassals" by Ew.; an interpretation
that suits the present verse very well, but will not do in [Jer
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024.md). It is certainly too narrow a
view, to confine the reference of the word to the mercenaries or Ionian
and Carian troops by whose help Necho's father Psammetichus acquired
sole supremacy (Graf), although this be the reference of the same word
in [Eze 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005.md). The land of Uz is, acc.
to the present passage and to [Lam
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md), where the daughter of Edom
dwells in the land of Uz, to be sought for in the neighbourhood of
Idumaea and the Egyptian border. To delete the words "and all the kings
of the land of Uz" as a gloss, with Hitz. and Gr., because they are not
in the lxx, is an exercise of critical violence. The lxx omitted them
for the same reason as that on which Hitz. still lays stress - namely,
that they manifestly do not belong to this place, but to [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md). And this argument is based on
the idea that the land of Uz ( ̓Αυσῖτις) lies much farther to the north
in Arabia Deserta, in the Hauran or the region of Damascus, or that it
is a collective name for the whole northern region of Arabia Deserta
that stretches from Idumaea as far as Syria; see Del. on [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md), and Wetzstein in Del.'s Job, S.
536f. This is an assumption for which valid proofs are not before us.
The late oriental legends as to Job's native country do not suffice for
this. The kings of the land of the Philistines are the kings of the four
towns next in order mentioned, with their territories, cf. [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md); [Sa1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#004.md). The fifth of the towns of the
lords of the Philistines, Gath, is omitted here as it was before this,
in [Amo 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#007.md). and [Zep
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004.md), and later in [Zac
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#005.md), not because Gath had already
fallen into premature decay; for in Amos' time Gath was still a very
important city. It is rather, apparently, because Gath had ceased to be
the capital of a separate kingdom or principality. There is remaining
now only a remnant of Ashdod; for after a twenty-nine years' siege, this
town was taken by Psammetichus and destroyed (Herod. ii. 157), so that
thus the whole territory great lost its importance. [Jer
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#021.md). On Edom, Moab, and the
Ammonites, cf. Jer 49:7-22; [Jer 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md);
[Jer 49:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md). [Jer
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022.md). The plural: "kings of Tyre and
Sidon," is to be understood as in [Jer
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md). With them are mentioned "the
kings of the island" or "of the coast" land, that is, beyond the
(Mediterranean) Sea. האי is not Κύπρος (Cyprus), but means, generally,
the Phoenician colonies in and upon the Mediterranean. Of the Arabian
tribes mentioned in [Jer 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md), the
Dedanites are those descended from the Cushite Dedan and living ear
Edom, with whom, however, the Abrahamic Dedanite had probably mingled; a
famous commercial people, [Isa 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md);
[Eze 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#015.md), [Eze
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#020.md); [Eze
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#013.md); [Job
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019.md). Tema is not Tm beyond the Hauran
(Wetzst. Reiseber. S. 21 and 93ff.; cf. on the other hand, the same in
Del.'s Job, S. 526), but Tem situated on the pilgrims' route from
Damascus to Mecca, between Tebk and Wadi el Kora, see Del. on [Isa
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#014.md); here, accordingly, the Arabian
tribe settled there. Buz is the Arabian race sprung from the second son
of Nahor. As to "hair-corners polled," see on [Jer
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#025.md). - The two appellations ערב and
"the mixed races that dwell in the wilderness" comprehend the whole of
the Arabian races, not merely those that are left after deducting the
already ([Jer 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023).md) mentioned nomad
tribes. The latter also dwelt in the wilderness, and the word ערב is a
general name, not for the whole of Arabia, but for the nomadic Arabs,
see on [Eze 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#021.md), whose tribal
chieftains, here called kings, are in Ezek. called נשׂיאים. In [Jer
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#025.md) come three very remote peoples
of the east and north-east: Zimri, Elamites, and Medes. The name Zimri
is found only here, and has been connected by the Syr. and most comm.
with Zimran, [Gen 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002.md), a son of
Abraham and Keturah. Accordingly זמרי would stand for זמרני, and might
be identified with Ζαβράμ, Ptol. vi. 7, 5, a people which occupied a
territory between the Arabs and Persians - which would seem to suit our
passage. The reference is certainly not to the Ζεμβρῖται in Ethiopia, in
the region of the later priestly city Mero (Strabo, 786). On Elam, see
on [Jer 49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md).

Finally, to make the list complete, [Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md) mentions the kings of the north,
those near and those far, and all the kingdoms of the earth. המּמלכות
with the article in stat. constr. against the rule. Hence Hitz. and Graf
infer that הארץ may not be genuine, it being at the same time
superfluous and not given in the lxx. This may be possible, but it is
not certain; for in [Isa 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017.md) we find
the same pleonastic mode of expression, and there are precedents for the
article with the nomen regens. "The one to (or with) the other" means:
according as the kingdoms of the north stand in relation to one another,
far or near. - After the mention of all the kings and peoples on whom
the king of Babylon is to execute judgment, it is said that he himself
must at last drink the cup of wrath. שׁשׁך is, according to [Jer
51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md), a name for Babylon, as Jerome
states, presumably on the authority of his Jewish teacher, who followed
the tradition. The name is formed acc. to the Canon Atbash, in virtue of
which the letters of the alphabet were put one for the other in the
inverse order (ת for א, שׁ for ב, etc.); thus שׁ would correspond to ב
and כ to ל. Cf. Buxtorf, Lex. talm. s.v. אתבשׁ and de abbreviaturis
hebr. p. 41. A like example is found in [Jer
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md), where כּשׂדּים is represented by
לב קמי yb d. The assertion of Gesen. that this way of playing with words
was not then in use, is groundless, as it also Hitz.'s, when he says it
appeared first during the exile, and is consequently none of Jeremiah's
work. It is also erroneous when many comm. remark, that Jeremiah made
use of the mysterious name from the fear of weakening the impression of
terror which the name of Babylon ought to make on their minds. These
assumptions are refuted by [Jer 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md),
where there is threatening of the punishment of spoliation made against
the king of Babylon and the land of the Chaldeans; and by [Jer
51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md), where alongside of Sheshach we
find in parallelism Babylon. The Atbash is, both originally and in the
present case, no mere playing with words, but a transposition of the
letters so as to gain a significant meaning, as may plainly be seen in
the transposition to לב , [Jer 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md).
This is the case with Sheshach also, which would be a contraction of
שׁכשׁך (see Ew. 158, c), from שׁכך, to sink (of the water, [Gen
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001).md), to crouch (of the bird-catcher,
[Jer 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026).md). The sig. is therefore a
sinking down, so that the threatening, [Jer
51:64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#064.md) : Babel shall sink and not rise
again, constitutes a commentary on the name; cf. Hgstb. Christ. iii. p.
377. The name does not sig. humiliation, in support of which Graf has
recourse partly to שׁחה, partly to the Arabic usage. For other arbitrary
interpretations, see in Ges. thes. p. 1486.

(Note: As has been done with the whole or with parts of [Jer
25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md), so too the last clause of
[Jer 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md) is pronounced by Ew.,
Hitz., and Graf to be spurious, a gloss that had ultimately found its
way into the text. This is affirmed because the clause is wanting in the
lxx, and because the prophet could not fitly threaten Babylon along with
the other nations (Hitz.); or because "the specification of a single
kingdom seems very much out of place, after the enumeration of the
countries that are to drink the cup of wrath has been concluded by the
preceding comprehensive intimation, 'all the kingdoms of the earth' "
(Gr.). Both reasons are valueless. By "shall drink after them" Babylon
is sufficiently distinguished from the other kings and countries
mentioned, and the reason is given why Babylon is not put on the same
footing with them, but is to be made to drink after them.)

[Jeremiah 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 25:27</span></span>

From [Jer 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027.md) onwards the commission
from God ([Jer 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015)..md) is still more
completely communicated to Jeremiah, so that the record of its
fulfilment ([Jer 25:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#017).md), together
with the enumeration of the various peoples, is to be regarded as an
explanatory parenthesis. These might the less unsuitably be inserted
after [Jer 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md), inasmuch as what
there is further of the divine command in [Jer
25:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027.md) is, if we examine its
substance, little else than an enforcement of the command. The prophet
is not merely to declare to them what is the meaning of this drinking of
wrath (Hitz.), but is to tell them that they are to drink the cup of
wrath to the bottom, so that they shall fall for drunkenness and not be
able to stand again ([Jer 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027).md); and
that they must drink, because when once Jahveh has begun judgment on His
own people, He is determined not to spare any other people. קיוּ from
קיה = קוא serves to strengthen the שׁכרוּ; in the second hemistich the
figurative statement passes into the real, as at [Jer
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md). In [Jer
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#028.md) שׁתו תשׁתּוּ is a peremptory
command; ye shall = must drink. [Jer
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029.md) gives the reason; since God
spares not His own people, then the heathen people need not count on
immunity. "And ye think to go unpunished" is a question of surprise.
Judgment is to be extended over all the inhabitants of the earth.

As to the fulfilment of this prophecy, see detail sin the exposition of
the oracles against the nations, Jer 46-51. Hence it appears that most
of the nations here mentioned were subject to Nebuchadnezzar. Only of
Elam is no express mention there made; and as to Media, Jeremiah has
given no special prophecy. As to both these peoples, it is very
questionable whether Nebuchadnezzar ever subdued them. For more on this,
see on [Jer 49:34-39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md). Although it is
said in [Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md) of the present
chapter and in [Jer 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#005.md). that God has
given all peoples, all the lands of the earth, into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar, yet it does not follow thence that Nebuchadnezzar really
conquered all. The meaning of the prophetic announcement is simply that
the king of Babylon will obtain dominion over the world for the coming
period, and that when his time is run, he too must fall beneath the
judgment. The judgment executed by Nebuchadnezzar on the nations is the
beginning of that upon the whole earth, before which, in course of time,
all inhabitants of the earth fall, even those whom Nebuchadnezzar's
sword has not reached. In the beginning of the Chaldean judgment the
prophet sees the beginning of judgment upon the whole earth.

[Jeremiah 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md)

"But do thou prophesy to them all these words, and say unto them: Jahveh
will roar from on high, and from His holy habitation let His voice
resound; He will roar against His pasture, raise a shout like treaders
of grapes against all the inhabitants of the earth. [Jer
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md). Noise reacheth to the end of
the earth, for controversy hath Jahveh with the nations; contend will He
with all flesh; the wicked He gives to the sword, is the saying of
Jahveh. [Jer 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#032.md). Thus saith Jahveh
of hosts: Behold, evil goeth forth from nation to nation, and (a) great
storm shall raise itself from the utmost coasts of the earth. [Jer
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#033.md). And the slain of Jahveh shall
lie on that day from one end of the earth unto the other, shall not be
lamented, neither gathered nor buried; for dung shall they be upon the
ground. [Jer 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md). Howl, ye
shepherds, and cry! and sprinkle you (with ashes), ye lordliest of the
flock! For your days are filled for the slaughter; and I scatter you so
that ye shall fall like a precious vessel. [Jer
25:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#035.md). Lost is flight to the
shepherds, and escape to the lordliest of the flock. [Jer
25:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#036.md). Hark! Crying of the shepherds
and howling of the lordliest of the flock; for Jahveh layeth waste their
pasture. [Jer 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#037.md). Desolated are the
pastures of peace because of the heat of Jahveh's anger. [Jer
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038.md). He hath forsaken like a young
lion his covert; for their land is become a desert, because of the
oppressing sword, and because of the heath of His anger."

In this passage the emblem of the cup of the Lord's anger ([Jer
25:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#025).md) is explained by a
description of the dreadful judgment God is to inflict on all the
inhabitants of the earth. This is not the judgment on the world at large
as distinguished from that proclaimed in [Jer
25:15-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md) against the kingdom of God
and the kingdoms of the world, as Ng. supposes. It is the nature of this
same judgment that is here discussed, not regard being here paid to the
successive steps of its fulfilment. [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md) and [Jer
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md) are only a further expansion of
the second half of [Jer 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029.md). "All
these words" refers to what follows. The clause"Jahveh will roar" to
"let His voice resound" is a reminiscence from [Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016.md) and [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md); but instead of "out of Zion and
out of Jerusalem" in those passages, we have here "from on high," i.e.,
heaven, and out of His holy habitation (in heaven), because the judgment
is not to fall on the heathen only, but on the theocracy in a special
manner, and on the earthly sanctuary, the temple itself, so that it can
come only from heaven or the upper sanctuary. Jahveh will roar like a
lion against His pasture (the pasture or meadow where His flock feeds,
cf. [Jer 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025).md); a name for the holy
land, including Jerusalem and the temple; not: the world subject to Him
(Ew.). 'הידד , He will answer Hedad like treaders of grapes; i.e., raise
a shout as they do. Answer; inasmuch as the shout or wary-cry of Jahveh
is the answer to the words and deeds of the wicked. Grammatically הידד
is accus. and object to the verb: Hedad he gives as answer. The word is
from הדד, crash, and signifies the loud cry with which those that tread
grapes keep time in the alternate raising and thrusting of the feet. Ew.
is accordingly correct, though far from happy, in rendering the word
"tramping-song;" see on [Isa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md). As
to the figure of the treader of grapes, cf. [Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md).

[Jer 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md)

שׁאון is the din of war, the noise of great armies, cf. [Isa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012.md)., etc. For the Lord conducts a
controversy, a cause at law, with the nations, with all flesh, i.e.,
with all mankind; cf. [Jer 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009.md), [Jer
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035.md). - הרשׁעים is for the sake of
emphasis put first and resumed again in the suffix to נתנם. "Give to the
sword" as in [Jer 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#009.md).

[Jer 25:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#032.md)

As a fierce storm (cf. [Jer 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019).md)
rises from the ends of the earth on the horizon, so will evil burst
forth and seize on one nation after another. Those slain by Jahveh will
then lie, unmourned and unburied, from one end of the earth to the
other; cf. [Jer 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md); [Jer
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004.md). With "slain of Jahveh," cf. [Isa
66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016.md). Jahveh slays them by the sword
in war.

[Jer 25:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md)

No rank is spared. This is intimated in the summons to howl and lament
addressed to the shepherds, i.e., the kings and rulers on earth (cf.
[Jer 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021.md); [Jer
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#022), etc..md), and to the lordly or
glorious of the flock, i.e., to the illustrious, powerful, and wealthy.
With "sprinkle you," cf. [Jer 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md).
Your days are full or filled for the slaughter, i.e., the days of your
life are full, so that ye shall be slain; cf. [Lam
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#018.md). וּתפוצותיכם is obscure and hard
to explain. It is so read by the Masora, while many codd. and editt.
have וּתפוּצותיכם. According to this latter form, Jerome, Rashi, Kimchi,
lately Maur. and Umbr., hold the word for a substantive: your
dispersions. But whether we connect this with what precedes or what
follows, we fail to obtain a fitting sense from it. Your days are full
and your dispersions, for: the time is come when ye shall be slain and
dispersed, cannot be maintained, because "dispersions" is not in keeping
with "are full." Again: as regards your dispersions, ye shall fall,
would give a good meaning, only if "your dispersions" meant: the flock
dispersed by the fault of the shepherds; and with this the second pers.
"ye shall fall" does not agree. The sig. of fatness given by Ew. to the
word is wholly arbitrary. Hitz., Gr. and Ng. take the word to be a
Tiphil (like תהרה, [Jer 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005.md); [Jer
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015).md), and read תּפיצותיכם, I scatter
you. This gives a suitable sense; and there is no valid reason for
attaching to the word, as Hitz. and Gr. do, the force of פּצץ or נפץ,
smite in pieces. The thought, that one part of the flock shall be slain,
the other scattered, seems quite apt; so also is that which follows,
that they are scattered shall fall and break like precious, i.e., fine,
ornamental vases. Hence there was no occasion for Ew.'s conjectural
emendation, כּכרי, like precious lambs. Nor does the lxx rendering:
ἥωσπερ οἱ κριοὶ οἱ ἐκλεκτοί, give it any support; for כּרים does not
mean rams, but lambs. The similar comparison of Jechoniah to a worthless
vessel (22:28) tells in favour of the reading in the text (Graf). - In
[Jer 25:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#035.md) the threatening is made
more woeful by the thought, that the shepherds shall find no refuge, and
that no escape will be open to the sheep.

[Jer 25:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#036.md)

The prophet is already hearing in spirit the lamentation to which in
[Jer 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md) he has called them, because
Jahveh has laid waste the pastures of the shepherds and their flocks,
and destroyed the peaceful meadows by the heat of His anger. - In [Jer
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038.md), finally, the discourse is
rounded off by a repetition and expansion of the thought with which the
description of the judgment was begun in [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md). As a young lion forsakes his
covert to seek for prey, so Jahveh has gone forth out of His heavenly
habitation to hold judgment on the people; for their (the shepherds')
land becomes a desert. The perff. are prophetic. כּי has grounding
force. The desolation of the land gives proof that the Lord has arisen
to do judgment. חרון היּונה seems strange, since the adjective היּונה
never occurs independently, but only in connection with חרב ([Jer
46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016.md); [Jer
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#016.md), and with עיר, [Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001).md). חרון, again, is regularly joined
with 'אף י, and only three times besides with a suffix referring to
Jahveh ([Exo 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#007.md); [Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md); [Eze
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#014).md). In this we find justification
for the conjecture of Hitz., Ew., Gr., etc., that we should read with
the lxx and Chald. חרב . The article with the adj. after the subst.
without one, here and in [Jer 46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016.md);
[Jer 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#016.md), is to be explained by the
looseness of connection between the participle and its noun; cf. Ew.
