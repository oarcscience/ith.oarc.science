### [Psalms Chapter 138](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 138:0</span></span>

The Mediator and Perfecter

There will come a time when the praise of Jahve, which according to [Psa
137:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#003.md) was obliged to be dumb in the
presence of the heathen, will, according to [Psa
138:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#005.md), be sung by the kings of the
heathen themselves. In the lxx [Psa
137:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md) side by side with τῷ Δαυίδ
also has the inscription Ἱιερεμίου, and [Psa
138:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md) has Ἀγγαίου καὶ Ζαχαρίου.
Perhaps these statements are meant to refer back the existing recension
of the text of the respective Psalms to the prophets named (vid., Khler,
Haggai, S. 33). From the fact that these names of psalmodists added by
the lxx do not come down beyond Malachi, it follows that the
Psalm-collection in the mind of the lxx was made not later than in the
time of Nehemiah.

The speaker in [Psa 138:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md), to follow
the lofty expectation expressed in [Psa
138:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#004.md), is himself a king, and
according to the inscription, David. There is, however, nothing to
favour his being the author; the Psalm is, in respect for the Davidic
Psalms, composed as it were out of the soul of David - an echo of 2 Sam.
7 (1 Chr. 17). The superabundant promise which made the throne of David
and of his seed an eternal throne is here gratefully glorified. The
Psalm can at any rate be understood, if with Hengstenberg we suppose
that it expresses the lofty self-consciousness to which David was raised
after victorious battles, when he humbly ascribed the glory to God and
resolved to build Him a Temple in place of the tent upon Zion.

[Psalms 138:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 138:1</span></span>

The poet will give thanks to Him, whom he means without mentioning Him
by name, for His mercy, i.e., His anticipating, condescending love, and
for His truth, i.e., truthfulness and faithfulness, and more definitely
for having magnified His promise (אמרה) above all His Name, i.e., that
He has given a promise which infinitely surpasses everything by which He
has hitherto established a name and memorial for Himself (על־כּל־שׁמך,
with ō instead of ŏ, an anomaly that is noted by the Masora, vid.,
Baer's Psalterium, p. 133). If the promise by the mouth of Nathan (2
Sam. 7) is meant, then we may compare [Sa2
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#021.md). גּדל, גּדול, גּדלּה are repeated
in that promise and its echo coming from the heart of David so
frequently, that this הגדּלתּ seems like a hint pointing to that
history, which is one of the most important crises in the history of
salvation. The expression נגד אלהים also becomes intelligible from this
history. Ewald renders it: "in the presence of God!" which is surely
meant to say: in the holy place (De Wette, Olshausen). But "before God
will I sing praise to Thee (O God!)" - what a jumble! The lxx renders
ἐναντίον ἀγγέλων, which is in itself admissible and full of meaning,

(Note: Bellarmine: Scio me psallentem tibi ab angelis, qui tibi
assistunt, videri et attendi et ideo ita considerate me geram in
psallendo, ut qui intelligam, in quo theatro consistam.)

but without coherence in the context of the Psalm, and also is to be
rejected because it is on the whole very questionable whether the Old
Testament language uses אלהים thus, without anything further to define
it, in the sense of "angels." It might be more readily rendered "in the
presence of the gods," viz., of the gods of the peoples (Hengstenberg,
Hupfeld, and Hitzig); but in order to be understood of gods which are
only seemingly such, it would require some addition. Whereas אלהים can
without any addition denote the magisterial possessors of the dignity
that is the type of the divine, as follows from [Psa
82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md) (cf. [Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007).md) in spite of Knobel, Graf, and
Hupfeld; and thus, too (cf. נגד מלכים in [Psa
119:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#046).md), we understand it here, with
Rashi, Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, Falminius, Bucer, Clericus, and others. What
is meant are "the great who are in the earth," [Sa2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#009.md), with whom David, inasmuch as he
became king from being a shepherd, is ranked, and above whom he has been
lifted up by the promise of an eternal kingship. Before these earthly
"gods" will David praise the God of the promise; they shall hear for
their salutary confusion, for their willing rendering of homage, that
God hath made him "the highest with respect to the kings of the earth"
([Psa 89:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028).md).

[Psalms 138:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 138:3</span></span>

There are two things for which the poet gives thanks to God: He has
answered him in the days of trouble connected with his persecution by
Saul and in all distresses; and by raising him to the throne, and
granting him victory upon victory, and promising him the everlasting
possession of the throne, He has filled him with a proud courage, so
that lofty feeling has taken up its abode in his soul, which was
formerly fearful about help. Just as רהב signifies impetuosity,
vehemence, and then also a monster, so הרהיב signifies both to break in
upon one violently and overpowerlingly ([Sol
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005.md); cf. Syriac arheb, Arabic arhaba,
to terrify), and to make any one courageous, bold, and confident of
victory. בּנפשׁי עז forms a corollary to the verb that is marked by
Mugrash or Dech: so that in my soul there was עז, i.e., power, viz., a
consciousness of power (cf. [Jdg
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021).md). The thanksgiving, which he, the
king of the promise, offers to God on account of this, will be
transmitted to all the kings of the earth when they shall hear (שׁמעוּ
in the sense of a fut. exactum) the words of His mouth, i.e., the divine
אמרה, and they shall sing of (שׁיר with בּ, like דּבּר בּ in [Psa
87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md), שׂיח בּ in [Psa
105:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#002.md) and frequently, הלּל בּ in [Psa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009.md), הזכּיר בּ in [Psa
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008), and the like.md) the ways of the
God of the history of salvation, they shall sing that great is the glory
of Jahve. [Psa 138:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006.md) tells us by what
means He has so super-gloriously manifested Himself in His leadings of
David. He has shown Himself to be the Exalted One who is His
all-embracing rule does not leave the lowly (cf. David's confessions in
[Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md); [Sa2
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#022).md) unnoticed ([Psa
113:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006).md), but on the contrary makes him
the especial object of His regard; and on the other hand even from afar
(cf. [Psa 139:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#002).md) He sees through (ידע
as in [Psa 94:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#011.md); [Jer
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#023).md) the lofty one who thinks
himself unobserved and conducts himself as if he were answerable to no
higher being ([Psa 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004).md). In correct
texts וגבה has Mugrash, and ממרחק Mercha. The form of the fut. Kal יידע
is formed after the analogy of the Hiphil forms ייליל in [Isa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md), and frequently, and ייטיב in
[Job 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#021.md); probably the word is
intended to be all the more emphatic, inasmuch as the first radical,
which disappears in ידע, is thus in a certain measure restored.

(Note: The Greek imperfects with the double (syllabic and temporal)
augment, as ἑώρων, ἀνέῳγον, are similar. Chajuǵ also regards the first
Jod in these forms as the preformative and the second as the radical,
whereas Abulwald, Gramm. ch. xxvi. p. 170, explains the first as a
prosthesis and the second as the preformative. According to the view of
others, e.g., of Kimchi, יידע might be fut. Hiph. weakened from יהדע
(יהידיע), which, apart from the unsuitable meaning, assumes a change of
consonants that is all the more inadmissible as ידע itself springs from
ודע. Nor is it to be supposed that יידע is modified from יידע (Luzzatto,
197), because it is nowhere written יידע.)

[Psalms 138:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 138:7</span></span>

Out of these experiences-so important for all mankind - of David, who
has been exalted by passing through humiliation, there arise from him
confident hopes concerning the future. The beginning of this strophe
calls [Psa 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004.md) to mind. Though his
way may lead through the midst of heart - oppressing trouble, Jahve will
loose these bands of death and quicken him afresh (חיּה as in [Psa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004.md); [Psa
71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020), and frequently.md). Though his
enemies may rage, Jahve will stretch forth His hand threateningly and
tranquillizingly over their wrath, and His right hand will save him.
ימינך is the subject according to [Psa
139:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#010.md) and other passages, and not
(for why should it be supposed to be this?) accus. instrumenti (vid.,
[Psa 60:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007).md). In [Psa
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008.md) יגמר is intended just as in [Psa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md) : the word begun He will carry
out, ἐπιτελεῖν ([Phi 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006).md); and בּעדי
(according to its meaning, properly: covering me) is the same as עלי in
that passage (cf. [Psa 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#006); 142:8.md).
The pledge of this completion is Jahve's everlasting mercy, which will
not rest until the promise is become perfect truth and reality. Thus,
therefore, He will not leave, forsake the works of His hands (vid., [Psa
90:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#016)..md), i.e., as Hengstenberg
correctly explains, everything that He has hitherto accomplished for
David, from his deliverance out of the hands of Saul down to the
bestowment of the promise - He will not let one of His works stand
still, and least of all one that has been so gloriously begun. הרפּה
(whence תּרף) signifies to slacken, to leave slack, i.e., leave
uncarried out, to leave to itself, as in [Neh
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#003.md). אל expresses a negation with a
measure of inward excitement.
