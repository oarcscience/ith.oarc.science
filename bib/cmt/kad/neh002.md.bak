Nehemiah Journeys to Jerusalem with the King's Permission, and Furnished
with Royal Letters. He Makes a Survey of the Walls, and Resolves to
Undertake the Work of Building Them - Nehemiah 2

Three months after receiving the tidings concerning Jerusalem, Nehemiah
perceived a favourable opportunity of making request to the king for
leave to undertake a journey to the city of his fathers for the purpose
of building it, and obtained the permission he entreated, together with
letters to the governors on this side the Euphrates to permit him to
pass through their provinces, and to the keeper of the royal forests to
supply wood for building the walls and gates, and an escort of captains
of the army and horsemen for his protection ([Neh
2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001).md), to the great vexation of
Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite ([Neh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010).md). In the third night after his
arrival at Jerusalem, Nehemiah rode round the city to survey the walls,
and incited the rulers of the people and the priests to undertake the
work of rebuilding them ([Neh
2:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#011).md). Sanballat and other enemies
of the Jews expressed their contempt thereat, but Nehemiah encountered
their ridicule with serious words ([Neh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019.md), [Neh
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#020).md).

[Nehemiah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 2:1</span></span>

[Neh 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001.md)

In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, when wine was
before him, Nehemiah as cupbearer took the wine and handed it to the
king. Nisan is, according to the Hebrew calendar, the first month of the
year; yet here, as in [Neh 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md), the
twentieth year of Artaxerxes is named, and the month Chisleu there
mentioned ([Neh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001).md), which, after the
Hebrew method of computing the year, was the ninth month and preceded
Nisan by three months, is placed in the same year. This can only be
explained on the grounds that either the twentieth year of Artaxerxes
did not coincide with the year of the calendar, but began later, or that
Nehemiah here uses the computation of time current in anterior Asia, and
also among the Jews after the captivity in civil matters, and which made
the new year begin in autumn. Of these two views we esteem the latter to
be correct, since it cannot be shown that the years of the king's reign
would be reckoned from the day of his accession. In chronological
statements they were reckoned according to the years of the calendar, so
that the commencement of a year of a reign coincided with that of the
civil year. If, moreover, the beginning of the year is placed in autumn,
Tishri is the first, Chisleu the third, and Nisan the seventh month. The
circumstances which induced Nehemiah not to apply to the king till three
months after his reception of the tidings which so distressed him, are
not stated. It is probable that he himself required some time for
deliberation before he could come to a decision as to the best means of
remedying the distresses of Jerusalem; then, too, he may not have
ventured at once to bring his request before the king from fear of
meeting with a refusal, and may therefore have waited till an
opportunity favourable to his desires should present itself. לפניו יין,
"wine was before the king," is a circumstantial clause explanatory of
what follows. The words allude to some banquet at which the king and
queen were present. The last sentence, "And I have not been sad before
him" (רע according to רעים פּניך of [Neh
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#002), of a sad countenance.md), can
neither mean, I had never before been sad before him (de Wette); nor, I
was accustomed not to be sad before him; but, I had not been sad before
him at the moment of presenting the cup to him (Bertheau), because it
would not have been becoming to serve the king with a sad demeanour:
comp. [Est 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#002.md). The king, however,
noticed his sadness, and inquired: "Why is thy countenance sad, since
thou art not sick? this is nothing but sorrow of heart, i.e., thy
sadness of countenance can arise only from sorrow of heart. Then I was
very sore afraid;" because the unexpected question obliged him to
explain the cause of his sorrow, and he could not tell how the king
would view the matter, nor whether he would favour his ardent desire to
assist his fellow-countrymen in Judah.

[Neh 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003.md)

He nevertheless openly expressed his desire, prefacing it by the
accustomed form of wishing the king prosperity, saying: "Let the king
live for ever;" comp. [Dan 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#004.md); [Dan
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#009.md). "Why should not my countenance be
sad? for the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and
its gates are burned with dire." The question, Why ... ? means: I have
certainly sufficient reason for sadness. The reason is, that (אשׁר) the
city where are the graves of my fathers lieth waste.

[Nehemiah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 2:4</span></span>

Then the king, feeling interested, asked him: For what dost thou make
request? על בּקּשׁ, to make request for or concerning a thing, like [Ezr
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#023.md); [Est
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#008.md); [Est
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#007.md). The question shows that the king
was inclined to relieve the distress of Jerusalem which had been just
stated to him. "And so I prayed to the God of heaven," to ensure divine
assistance in the request he was about to lay before the king. Then
Nehemiah answered ([Neh 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#005).md), "If it
please the king, and if thy servant is well-pleasing before thee, (I
beg) that thou wouldest send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers'
sepulchres, that I may build it." לפני ייטב, here and [Est
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#014.md), is of like meaning with בּעיני
ייטב or טּוב, [Est 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#005.md); [Sa2
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#004.md) : if thy servant is right in
thine eyes, i.e., if he thinks rightly concerning the matter in
question. The matter of his request is directly combined with this
conditional clause by אשׁר, the connecting term, I beg, being easily
supplied from the king's question: For what dost thou beg?

[Nehemiah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 2:6</span></span>

The king and the queen, who was sitting near him (שׁגל, [Psa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010).md), grant him permission to depart
after he has, in answer to their inquiry, fixed the period of his
absence. Nehemiah makes the result of the conversation, "And it pleased
the king," etc., follow immediately upon the question of the king and
queen: For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return?
before telling us what was his answer to this question, which is not
brought in till afterwards, so that זמן לו ואתּנה must be understood as
expressing: since I had determined the time.

[Nehemiah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 2:7</span></span>

Hereupon Nehemiah also requested from the king letters to the governors
beyond (west of) the river (Euphrates), to allow him to travel
unmolested through their provinces to Judah (לי יתּנוּ, let them give me
= let there be given me; העביר, to pass or travel through a country,
comp. [Deu 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#020).md); and a letter to
Asaph, the keeper (inspector) of the royal forests, to give him timber
to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, and for the
walls of the city, and for the governor's own house. These requests were
also granted. פּרדּס in [Sol 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013.md);
[Ecc 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md), signifies a park or orchard;
it is a word of Aryan origin (in Armenian pardez, the garden round the
house, in Greek παράδεισος), and is explained either from the Sanscrit
parta-da, a superior district, or (by Haug) from the Zend. pairi-daza, a
fenced-in place. In Old-Persian it probably denoted the king's
pleasure-grounds, and in our verse a royal wood or forest. Of the
situation of this park nothing reliable can be ascertained. As wood for
extensive buildings was to be taken from it, the sycamore forest in the
low plains, which had been the property of King David ([Ch1
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#028).md), and became, after the
overthrow of the Davidic dynasty, first a Babylonian, and then a Persian
possession, may be intended.

(Note: Older expositors supposed a regio a Libano ad Antilibanum
protensa et arboribus amoenissimus consita to be meant. In this view,
indeed, they followed [Sol 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013.md), but
incorrectly. Cler. thought it to be a tractus terrarum in Judaea, qui
Paradisus regius dicebatur. Josephus speaks (Ant. viii. 7. 3) of fine
gardens and ponds at Etham, seven miles south of Jerusalem, where
Solomon often made pleasure excursions. Hence Ewald (Gesch. iv. p. 169,
comp. iii. p. 328) thinks that the פּרדּס which belonged to the king
must have been Solomon's old royal park at Aetham, which in the time of
Nehemiah had become a Persian domain, and that the hill town lying not
far to the west of it, and now called by the Arabs Fureidis, i.e.,
paradisaic, may have received its Hebrew name Beth-Kerem, i.e., house of
vineyards, from similar pleasure-grounds. Hereupon Bertheau grounds the
further conjecture, that "the whole district from Aetham to the hill of
Paradise, situate about a league east-south-east of Aetham, may from its
nature have been once covered with forest; and no hesitation would be
felt in connecting the name of the mountain Gebel el-Fureidis or
el-Feridis (Paradise-hill - hill which rises in a Pardes) with the
Pardes in question, if it could be proved that this name was already in
existence in prae-Christian times." All these conjectures rest on very
uncertain bases. The Dshebel Fureidis is also called the Hill of the
Franks. See the description of it in Robinson's Palestine, ii. p. 392f.,
and Tobler, Topographie von Jerusalem, ii. pp. 565-572.)

לקרות, to timber, to overlay, to cover with beams (comp. [Ch2
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#011).md) the gates of the citadel which
belongs to the house, i.e., to the temple. This citadel - בּירה, in
Greek Βᾶρις - by the temple is mentioned here for the first time; for in
[Ch1 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001.md), [Ch1
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#019.md), the whole temple is called
בּירה. It was certainly situate on the same place where Hyrcanus I, son
of Simon Maccabaeus, or the kings of the Asmonean race, built the
akro'polis and called it Baris (Jos. Ant. xv. 11. 4, comp. with xviii.
4. 3). This was subsequently rebuilt by Herod when he repaired and
enlarged the temple, and named Antonia, in honour of his friend Mark
Antony. It was a citadel of considerable size, provided with corner
towers, walls, chambers, and spacious courts, built on a north-western
side of the external chambers of the temple, for the defence of that
edifice, and did not extend the entire length of the north side of the
present Haram, as Robinson (see Biblical Researches, p. 300) seeks to
show; comp., on the other hand, Tobler, Topographic von Jerusalem, i. p.
688f., and Rosen, Haram von Jerusalem, p. 25f. וּלחומת is coordinate
with לקרות: "and for the walls of the city;" the timber not being used
for building the wall itself, but for the gates ([Neh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#003.md), [Neh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#006).md). "And for the house into which I
come (to dwell)." This must be Nehemiah's official residence as Pecha.
For though it is not expressly stated in the present chapter that
Nehemiah was appointed Pecha (governor) by Artaxerxes, yet Nehemiah
himself tells us, [Neh 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014.md), that he
had been Pecha from the twentieth year of Artaxerxes. Former governors
had perhaps no official residence becoming their position. By לבּית the
temple cannot, as older expositors thought, be intended. This request
also was granted by the king, "according to the good hand of my God upon
me;" comp. rem. on [Ezr 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006.md).

[Nehemiah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 2:9</span></span>

Nehemiah delivered the letter when he came to the governors on this side
Euphrates. The king had also sent with him captains of the army and
horsemen. The second half of [Neh 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#009.md)
contains a supplementary remark, so that ויּשׁלח must be expressed by
the pluperfect. Ezra had been ashamed to request a military escort from
the Persian monarch ([Ezr 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022).md); but
the king gave to the high dignitary called Pecha a guard of soldiers,
who certainly remained with him in Jerusalem also for his protection
([Ezr 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#017).md). Besides these, there were
in his retinue his brethren, i.e., either relations or
fellow-countrymen, and servants, comp. [Neh
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#010.md); [Neh
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#010.md). That this retinue is not
mentioned in the present verses, is owing to the fact that the journey
itself is not further described, but only indirectly alluded to.

[Nehemiah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 2:10</span></span>

When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite heard of his coming,
it caused them great annoyance (להם ירע is strengthened by גּדולה רעה,
as in [Jon 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001).md) that a man (as
Nehemiah expresses himself ironically from their point of view) was come
to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. Sanballat is called the
Horonite either after his birthplace or place of residence, yet
certainly not from Horonaim in Moab, as older expositors imagined ([Isa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md); [Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034).md), since he would then have been
called a Moabite, but from either the upper or nether Beth-horon,
formerly belonging to the tribe of Ephraim ([Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md), [Jos
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005.md); [Jos
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013).md), and therefore in the time of
Nehemiah certainly appertaining to the region of the Samaritans
(Berth.). Tobiah the Ammonite is called העבד, the servant, probably as
being a servant or official of the Persian king. These two individuals
were undoubtedly influential chiefs of the neighbouring hostile nations
of Samaritans and Ammonites, and sought by alliances with Jewish nobles
([Neh 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#017.md); [Neh
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004.md), [Neh
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#028).md) to frustrate, whether by force
or stratagem, the efforts of Ezra and Nehemiah for the internal and
external security of Judah. Nehemiah mentions thus early their annoyance
at his arrival, by way of hinting beforehand at their subsequent
machinations to delay the fortifying of Jerusalem.

[Nehemiah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 2:11</span></span>

Nehemiah's arrival at Jerusalem. He surveys the wall, and resolves to
restore it. - [Neh 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#011.md) Having arrived
at Jerusalem and rested three days (as Ezra had also done, [Ezr
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#032).md), he arose in the night, and some
few men with him, to ride round the wall of the city, and get a notion
of its condition. His reason for taking but few men with him is given in
the following sentence: "I had told no man what my God had put in my
heart to do for Jerusalem." Although he had come to Jerusalem with the
resolution of fortifying the city by restoring its circumvallation, he
spoke of this to no one until he had ascertained, by an inspection of
the wall, the magnitude and extent of the work to be accomplished. For,
being aware of the hostility of Sanballat and Tobiah, he desired to keep
his intention secret until he felt certain of the possibility of
carrying it into execution. Hence he made his survey of the wall by
night, and took but few men with him, and those on foot, for the sake of
not exciting attention. The beast on which he rode was either a horse or
a mule.

[Nehemiah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 2:13</span></span>

"And I went out by night by the valley-gate, and towards the
dragon-well, and to the dung-gate." אל־פּני, in the direction towards.
The dragon-well only occurs here by this name. Judging from its position
between the valley-gate and the dung-gate, it is either identical with
the well of Gihon (Robinson, Palestine, ii. p. 166), whose waters supply
the upper and lower pools in the valley of Gihon, the present Birket el
Mamilla and Birket es Sultan, or situate in its immediate neighbourhood.
The valley-gate is the modern gate of the city leading to the valley of
Gihon, and situated at or near the present Jaffa gate; see rem. on [Neh
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#013). The dung-gate (האשׁפּת שׁער.md),
which in [Neh 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#013.md) also is placed next
the valley-gate, and was a thousand cubits distant therefrom, must be
sought for on the south-western side of Zion, where a road, to the south
of Nebi Dd and the Zion gate, now descends into the valley of Hinnom,
towards Sr Baher. "And I viewed the walls of Jerusalem which lay broken
down, and its gates which were consumed by fire." The word שׁבר, which
the lxx read, "I was breaking down," gives no tolerable sense; for it
cannot mean, I broke through the walls, or, I made a path through the
ruins. Many MSS, however, and several editions, offer שׂבר; and R. Norzi
informs us that D. Kimchi and Aben Ezra read שׁבר. שׂבר, of which only
the Piel occurs in Hebrew, answers to the Aramaean סבר, to look to
something; and to the Arabic sbr, to investigate; and ב סבר means to
look on, to consider, to direct the eyes and thoughts to some object. In
the open מ of הם Hiller conjectures that there is a trace of another
reading, perhaps מפרצים; comp. [Neh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md).

[Nehemiah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 2:14</span></span>

"And I went on to the fountain-gate, and to the king's pool, and there
was no room for the beast to come through under me." The very name of
the fountain-or well-gate points to the foundation of Siloah (see rem.
on [Neh 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015).md); hence it lay on the
eastern declivity of Zion, but not in the district or neighbourhood of
the present Bb el Mogharibeh, in which tradition finds the ancient
dung-gate, but much farther south, in the neighbourhood of the pool of
Siloah; see rem. on [Neh 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md). The
King's pool is probably the same which Josephus (bell. Jud. v. 4. 2)
calls Σολομῶνος κολυμβήθρα, and places east of the spring of Siloah, and
which is supposed by Robinson (Palestine, ii. pp. 149, 159) and Thenius
(das vorexil. Jerus., appendix to a commentary on the books of the
Kings, p. 20) to be the present Fountain of the Virgin. Bertheau,
however, on the other hand, rightly objects that the Fountain of the
Virgin lying deep in the rock, and now reached by a descent of thirty
steps, could not properly be designated a pool. He tries rather to
identify the King's pool with the outlet of a canal investigated by
Tobler (Topogr. i. p. 91f.), which the latter regards as a conduit for
rain-water, fluid impurities, or even the blood of sacrificed animals;
but Bertheau as an aqueduct which, perhaps at the place where its
entrance is now found, once filled a pool, of which, indeed, no trace
has as yet been discovered. But apart from the difficulty of calling the
outlet of a canal a pool (Arnold in Herzog's Realencycl. xviii. p. 656),
the circumstance, that Tobler could find in neither of the
above-described canals any trace of high antiquity, tells against this
conjecture. Much more may be said in favour of the view of E. G. Schultz
(Jerusalem, p. 58f.), that the half-choked-up pool near Ain Silwan may
be the King's pool and Solomon's pool; for travellers of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries mention a piscina grandis foras and natatoria
Silo at the mouth of the fountain of Siloah (comp. Leyrer in Herzog's
Realencycl. xvi. p. 372). See also rem. on [Neh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md). Here there was no room for the
beast to get through, the road being choked up with the ruins of the
walls that had been destroyed, so that Nehemiah was obliged to dismount.

[Nehemiah 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 2:15</span></span>

Then I (went on) ascending the valley and viewing the wall, and so
entered by the valley-gate, and returned. ואהי with the participle
expresses the continuance of an action, and hence in this place the
continuous ascent of the valley and survey of the wall. The נחל which he
ascended was doubtless the valley of Kidron (קדרון נחל, [Sa2
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023.md); [Kg1
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#037), and elsewhere.md). ואבוא ואשׁוּב
are connected, שׁוּב expressing merely the idea of repetition (Gesenius,
heb. Gram. 142, 3): I came again into the valley-gate. Older expositors
incorrectly explain these words to mean, I turned round, traversing
again the road by which I had come; Bertheau: I turned to go farther in
a westerly direction, and after making the circuit of the entire city, I
re-entered by the valley-gate. This sense is correct as to fact, but
inadmissible, as requiring too much to complete it. If we take אשׁוּב
adverbially, these completions are unnecessary. Nehemiah does not give
the particulars of the latter portion of his circuit, but merely tells
us that after having ascended the valley of Kidron, he re-entered by the
valley-gate, and returned to his residence, obviously assuming, that
from the upper part of the vale of Kidron he could only return to the
valley-gate at the west by passing along the northern part of the wall.

[Nehemiah 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 2:16</span></span>

He had spoken to no one of his purpose ([Neh
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#012).md); hence the rulers of the city
knew neither whither he was going nor what he was doing (i.e.,
undertaking) when he rode by night out of the city gate accompanied by a
few followers. As yet he had said nothing either to the Jews (the
citizens of Jerusalem), the priests, the nobles, the rulers, or the rest
who did the work. החרים and הסּגנים are connected, as in [Ezr
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#002.md) השּׂרים and הסּגנים. The nobles
(חרים, nobiles) or princes are the heads of the different houses or
races of the people; סגנים, the rulers of the town, the authorities.
המּלאכה עשׂה, the doers of the work, are the builders; comp. [Ezr
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#009.md). When these are, in comparison
with the priests, nobles, and rulers, designated as יתר, the remnant,
this is explained by the fact that the priests and rulers of the people
were not actively engaged in building. המּלאכה, the work in question,
i.e., here the building of the walls. כּן עד, until thus, i.e., until
now, until the time apparent from the context. Nehemiah then, having
inspected the condition of the ruined walls, and being now persuaded of
the possibility of restoring them, made known his resolution to the
nobles, the rulers, and the community, i.e., to a public assembly called
together for this purpose ([Neh 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#017).md).
"Ye see (have before your eyes, know from experience) the distress that
we are in, that Jerusalem lieth waste: come (לכוּ), let us build up the
walls of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach." In other words: Let
us by building our walls put an end to the miserable condition which
gives our adversaries occasion to reproach us.

[Nehemiah 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">neh 2:18</span></span>

To gain the favourable regard of the assembly for his design, he informs
them how God had so far prospered his undertaking: I told them of the
hand of my God, that it = that the hand my God had graciously provided
for me, i.e., that God had so graciously arranged my journey to
Jerusalem; and the king's words that he had spoken to me, sc. with
respect to the building of the wall, of which we are told [Neh
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008.md) only thus much, that the king gave
orders to the keeper of the royal forest to give him wood for building.
Encouraged by this information, the assembly exclaimed, "Let us arise
and build;" and "they strengthened their hands for good," i.e., they
vigorously set about the good work.

[Nehemiah 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019.md)

When the adversaries of the Jews heard this, they derided their
resolution. Beside Sanballat and Tobiah (comp. [Neh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010).md), Geshem the Arabian is also
named as an adversary: so, too, [Neh
6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001.md), and [Neh
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#006.md), where Gashmu, the fuller
pronunciation of his name, occurs. He was probably the chief of some
Arab race dwelling in South Palestine, not far from Jerusalem (comp. the
Arabians, [Neh 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001).md). These enemies
ironically exclaimed: What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel
against the king? The irony lies in the fact that they did not give the
Jews credit for power to build fortifications, so as to be able to
rebel. Comp. [Neh 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#006.md), where
Sanballat, in an open letter to Nehemiah, again reproaches them with
rebellion.

[Neh 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#020.md)

Nehemiah replied with impressive gravity: "The God of heaven, He will
prosper us, and we His servants will arise and build; but ye have no
portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem." צדקה like [Sa2
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#029.md). זכּרון, memorial; only members
of the congregation, who may hope to live in their descendants in
Jerusalem, can be said to have a memorial there.
