The Book of Nehemiah

Introduction

1\. Contents, Division, and Object of the Book of Nehemia

This book, according to its title, contains נחמיה דּברי, and in it
Nehemiah relates, almost always in the first person, his journey to
Jerusalem, and the work which he there effected. נחמיה דּברי, used as
the title of a work, signifies not narratives, but deeds and
experiences, and consequently here the history of Nehemiah. Apart from
the contents of the book, this title might, in conformity with the
twofold meaning of דברים, verba and res, designate both the words or
discourses and the acts or undertakings of Nehemiah. But דּברי means
words, discourses, only in the titles of prophetical or didactic books,
i.e., writings of men whose vocation was the announcement of the word:
comp. e.g., [Jer 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md); [Hos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md), and others. In historical
writings, on the contrary, the דּברי of the men whose lives and acts are
described, are their deeds and experiences: thus דויד דּברי, [Ch1
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029.md); שׁלמה דּברי, written שׁלמה
דּברי ספר על [Kg1 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041.md), comp. [Ch2
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029.md), - the history of David, of
Solomon; ירבעם דּברי, [Kg1 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#019.md), the
acts of Jeroboam, which are more exactly defined by the addition אשׁר
נלחם ועשׁר מלך. So, too, in the case of the other kings, when reference
is made to historical works concerning their reigns. It is in this sense
that the title of the present book must be understood; and hence both
Luther and de Wette have correctly translated it: the history of
Nehemiah. Hence the title only testifies to the fact, that the work at
the head of which it stands treats of the things, i.e., of the acts, of
Nehemiah, and the events that happened to him, without stating anything
concerning its author. That Nehemiah was himself the historian of his
own deeds, appears only from the circumstance that the narrative is
written in the first person.

The contents of the book are as follows: Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah,
a Jew, of whom nothing further is known, and cupbearer to the Persian
king Artaxerxes Longimanus, is plunged into deep affliction by the
account he receives from his brother Hanani, and certain other men from
Judah, of the sad condition of those who had returned from Babylon, and
especially of the state of the ruined walls and gates of Jerusalem. He
entreats with fervent supplications the mercy of God ([Neh
1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001).md), and shortly after seizes a
favourable opportunity to request the king to send him to Judah to build
the city of his fathers' sepulchres, and to give him letters to the
governors on the other side of Euphrates, that they may provide him with
wood for building from the royal forests. This petition being graciously
acceded to by the monarch, he travels, accompanied by captains of forces
and horsemen, to Jerusalem, and soon after his arrival rides by night
round the city, accompanied by some few companions, to ascertain the
state of the walls. He then communicates to the rulers of the people his
resolution to build and restore the walls, and invites them to undertake
this work with him (Neh 2). Then follows in Neh 3 a list of the
individuals and families who built the several portions of the wall with
their gates; and in Neh 4:1-6:19, an account of the difficulties
Nehemiah had to overcome in the prosecution of the work, viz.: (1) the
attempts of the enemies of the Jews forcibly to oppose and hinder the
building, by reason of which the builders were obliged to work with
weapons in their hands (4:1-4:17); (2) the oppression of the poorer
members of the community by wealthy usurers, which Nehemiah put a stop
to by seriously reproving their injustice, and by his own great
unselfishness (Neh 5); and (3) the plots made against his life by his
enemies, which he frustrated by the courageous faith with which he
encountered them. Thus the building of the wall was, notwithstanding all
these difficulties, brought to a successful termination (Neh 6). - This
work accomplished, Nehemiah directed his efforts towards securing the
city against hostile attacks by appointing watches at the gates ([Neh
7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001.md), and increasing the numbers of
the dwellers in Jerusalem; in pursuance of which design, he assembled
the nobles and people for the purpose of enrolling their names according
to their genealogy ([Neh 7:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#004).md). While
occupied with this matter, he found a list of those houses of Judah that
had returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua; and this he gives,
Neh 7:6-73. Then, on the approach of the seventh month of the year, the
people assembled at Jerusalem to hear the public reading of the law by
Ezra, to keep the new moon and the feast of this month, and, after the
celebration of the feast of tabernacles, to observe a day of prayer and
fasting, on which occasion the Levites making confession of sin in the
name of the congregation, they renewed their covenant with God by
entering into an oath to keep the law. This covenant being committed to
writing, was sealed by Nehemiah as governor, by the chiefs of the
priests, of the Levites, and of the houses of the people, and the
contributions for the support of the worship of God and its ministers
arranged (Neh 8-10). The decision arrived at concerning the increase of
the inhabitants of Jerusalem was next carried into execution, one of
every ten dwellers in the provinces being chosen by lot to go to
Jerusalem and dwell there ([Neh
11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001)). Then follow lists, (1.md) of the
houses and races who dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah and
Benjamin (11:3-36); (2) of the priestly and Levitical families who
returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua, and of the heads of
priestly and Levitical families in the days of Joiakim the high priest,
Nehemiah, and Ezra (Neh 12:1-26). These are succeeded by an account of
the solemn dedication of the walls (Neh 12:27-43). Then, finally, after
some general remarks on certain institutions of divine worship, and an
account of a public reading of the law (Neh 12:44-13:3), the book
concludes with a brief narration of what Nehemiah effected during his
second sojourn there, after his journey to the court in the
thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, and his return for the purpose of
putting a stop to certain illegal acts which had prevailed during his
absence, such as marriages with heathen women, non-payment of tithes and
dues to Levites, desecration of the Sabbath by field-labour, and by
buying and selling (Neh 13:4-31).

According to what has been stated, this book may be divided into three
sections. The first, chs. 1-6, treats of the building of the walls and
gates of Jerusalem through the instrumentality of Nehemiah; the
narrative concerning the occasion of his journey, and the account of the
journey itself (Neh 1:1-2:10), forming the introduction. The second,
chs. 7-12:43, furnishes a description of the further efforts of Nehemiah
to increase and ensure the prosperity of the community in Judah and
Jerusalem, first, by securing Jerusalem from hostile attacks; then, by
seeking to increase the population of the city; and, lastly, by
endeavouring to bring the domestic and civil life of the people into
conformity with the precepts of the law, and thus to furnish the
necessary moral and religious basis for the due development of the
covenant people. The third, Neh 12:44-13:31, states how Nehemiah, during
his second sojourn at Jerusalem, continued these efforts for the purpose
of ensuring the permanence of the reform which had been undertaken.

The aim of Nehemiah's proceedings was to place the civil prosperity of
the Israelites, now returned from exile to the land of their fathers, on
a firm basis. Briefly to describe what he effected, at one time by
direct personal effort, at another in conjunction with his contemporary
Ezra the priest and scribe, is the object of his record. As Nehemiah's
efforts for the civil welfare of his people as the congregation of the
Lord were but a continuation of those by which Zerubbabel the prince,
Joshua the high priest, and Ezra the scribe had effected the foundation
of the community of returned exiles, so too does his book form the
continuation and completion of that of Ezra, and may in this respect be
regarded as its second part. It is, moreover, not merely similar in
kind, to the book of Ezra, especially with regard to the insertion of
historical and statistical lists and genealogical registries, but has
also the same historical object, viz., to show how the people of Israel,
after their return from the Babylonian captivity, were by the
instrumentality of Nehemiah fully re-established in the land of promise
as the congregation of the Lord.

2\. Integrity of the Book of Nehemiah, and Date of Its Composition

Nehemiah gives his account of the greater part of his labours for the
good of his fellow-countrymen in the first person; and this form of
narrative is not only uniformly maintained throughout the first six
chapters (from Neh 1:1-7:5), but also recurs in Neh 12:27-43, and from
[Neh 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006.md) to the end. The formula too:
Think upon me, my God, etc., peculiar to Nehemiah, is repeated [Neh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#019.md); [Neh
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#014.md); [Neh
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#014.md), [Neh
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#022.md), [Neh
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#029.md), [Neh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#031.md). Hence not only has the
composition of the larger portion of this book been universally admitted
to be the work of Nehemiah, but the integrity of its first section (Neh
1-6) has been generally acknowledged. On the composition and authorship
of the second section, 7:73b-12:26, on the contrary, the verdict of
modern criticism is almost unanimous in pronouncing it not to have been
the work of Nehemiah, but composed from various older documents and
records by the compiler of the books of 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra and
Nehemiah - the so-called chronicler who lived a hundred years later -
and by him interpolated in "the record of Nehemiah." This view has been
chiefly based upon the facts, that in chs. 8-10 the style is different;
that Nehemiah himself is not the prominent person, Ezra occupying the
foreground, and Nehemiah being merely the subject of a passing remark
([Neh 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009.md) and [Neh
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002).md); that there is in [Neh
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#014.md) no reference to [Ezr
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004.md) with respect to the feast of
tabernacles; and that [Ezr 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md) is in
verbal accordance with [Neh 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001.md)
(Bertheau, Comm. p. 11, and de Wette-Schrader, Einl. in das A. T. 236).
Of these reasons, the first (the dissimilarity of style) is an assertion
arising from a superficial examination of these chapters, and in support
of which nothing further is adduced than that, instead of Elohim, and
especially the God of heaven, elsewhere current with Nehemiah when
speaking of God, the names Jehovah, Adonai, and Elohim are in this
section used promiscuously. In fact, however, the name Elohim is chiefly
used even in these chapters, and Jahve but seldom; while in the prayer
Neh 9 especially, such other appellations of God occur as Nehemiah, with
the solemnity befitting the language of supplication, uses also in the
prayer in [Neh 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md).

(Note: Compare the exact statement of the case in my Lehrbuch, 149, note
4, which opponents have ignored, because nothing in the way of facts can
be brought against it.)

The other three reasons are indeed correct, in so far as they are actual
facts, but they prove nothing. It is true that in Neh 8-10 Nehemiah
personally occupies a less prominent position than Ezra, but this is
because the actions therein related, viz., the public reading of the
law, and the direction of the sacred festivals, belonged not to the
office of Nehemiah the Tirshatha and royal governor, but to that, of
Ezra the scribe, and to the priests and Levites. Even here, however,
Nehemiah, as the royal Tirshatha, stands at the head of the assembled
people, encourages them in conjunction with Ezra and the priests, and is
the first, as praecipuum membrum ecclesiae ([Neh
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002).md), to seal the document of the
covenant just concluded. Again, though it is certain that in the
description of the feast of tabernacles, [Ezr
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#014.md)., there is no express allusion to
its former celebration under Zerubbabel and Joshua, [Ezr
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004.md), yet such allusions are unusual
with biblical writers in general. This is shown, e.g., by a comparison
of [Ch2 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001.md), [Ch2
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#018.md) with [Ch2
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md), [Ch2
30:13-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013.md); and yet it has never struck
any critic that an argument against the single authorship of 2 Chr.
might be found in the fact that no allusion to the earlier passover held
under Hezekiah, 2 Chron 30, is made in the description of the passover
under Josiah, 2 Chron 35. Finally, the verbal coincidence of [Neh
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001.md) (properly [Neh
7:73](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073.md) and [Neh
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001).md) with [Ezr
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md) amounts to the statement that
"when the seventh month was come, all Israel gathered out of their
cities as one man to Jerusalem." All else is totally different; the
assembly in Neh 8 pursues entirely different objects and undertakes
entirely different matters from that in [Ezr
3:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md). The peculiarities, moreover,
of Nehemiah's style could as little appear in what is narrated, chs.
8-10, as in his description of the building of the wall, Neh 3, or in
the list of the families who returned from captivity with Zerubbabel and
Joshua, Neh 7 - portions which no one has yet seriously objected to as
integral parts of the book of Nehemiah. The same remark applies to the
list of the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the province, 11:3-36, which
even Bertheau and Schrader admit to have originated from the record of
Nehemiah, or to have been composed by Nehemiah. If, however, Nehemiah
composed these lists, or incorporated them in his record, why should it
not also be himself, and not the "subsequent chronicler," who inserted
in his work the lists of priests and Levites, 12:1-26, when the
description of the dedication of the wall which immediately follows them
is evidently his own composition?

One reason for maintaining that these lists of priests and Levites are
of later origin than the times of Nehemiah is said to be, that they
extend to Jaddua the high priest, who was contemporary with Alexander
the Great. If this assertion were as certain as it is confidently
brought forward, then indeed these lists might well be regarded as a
subsequent interpolation in the book of Nehemiah. For Nehemiah, who was
at least thirty years of age when he first came to Jerusalem, in the
twentieth year of Artaxerxes, i.e., b.c. 445, could hardly have lived to
witness the overthrow of the Persian monarchy by Alexander, b.c. 330;
or, even if he did attain the age of 145, would not have postponed the
writing of his book to the last years of his life. When, however, we
consider somewhat more closely the priests and Levites in question, we
shall perceive that [Neh 12:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001.md)
contains a list of the chiefs of the priests and Levites who returned
from captivity with Zerubbabel and Joshua, which consequently descends
from the times before Nehemiah; [Neh
12:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012.md), a list of the heads of the
priestly houses in the days of the high priest Joiakim, the son of
Joshua; and [Neh 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#024.md), [Neh
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#025.md), a list of the heads of chiefs
of Levi (of the Levites), with the closing remark, [Neh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026.md) : "These were in the days of
Joiakim the son of Joshua, and in the days of Nehemiah and Ezra," Now
the high priest Joiakim, the son of Joshua, the contemporary of
Zerubbabel, was the predecessor and father of the high priest Eliashib,
the contemporary of Nehemiah. Consequently both these lists descend from
the time previous to Nehemiah's arrival at Jerusalem; and the mention of
Ezra and Nehemiah along with Joiakim proves nothing more than that the
chiefs of the Levites mentioned in the last list were still living in
the days of Nehemiah. Thus these three lists contain absolutely nothing
which reaches to a period subsequent to Nehemiah. Between the first and
second, however, there stands ([Neh
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#010.md), [Neh
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011).md) the genealogical notice: Joshua
begat Joiakim, Joiakim begat Eliashib, Eliashib begat Jonathan (correct
reading, Johanan), and Jonathan begat Jaddua; and between the second and
third it is said, [Neh 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022.md) : With
respect to the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and
Jaddua, the heads of houses are recorded, and the priests under the
reign of Darius the Persian; and [Neh
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#023.md) : With respect to the sons of
Levi, the heads of houses are recorded in the book of the Chronicles
even to the days of Johanan. From these verses ([Neh
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#010.md), [Neh
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011.md), and [Neh
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022.md), [Neh
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#023).md) it is inferred that the lists
descend to the time of the high-priesthood of Jaddua, the contemporary
of Alexander the Great. To this we reply, that viewing the circumstance
that Eliashib was high priest in the time of Nehemiah ([Neh
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md); [Neh
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004.md), [Neh
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#007).md), it cannot be an absolute
objection that Jaddua was still living in the days of Alexander the
Great, since from the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, i.e.,
from b.c. 433, to the destruction of the Persian empire b.c. 330, there
are only 103 years, a period for which three high priests, each
exercising his office thirty-five years, would suffice. But on the other
hand, it is very questionable whether in [Neh
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011.md) and [Neh
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012.md) Jaddua is mentioned as the
officiating high priest, or only as the son of Johanan, and grandson of
Joiada the high priest. The former of these views receives no
corroboration from [Neh 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011.md), for
there nothing else is given but the genealogy of the high-priestly line.
Nor can it any more be proved from [Neh
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022.md) that the words, "in the days of
Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, were the Levites recorded or
enrolled," are to be understood of four different lists made under four
successive high priests. The most natural sense of the words, on the
contrary, is that one enrollment took place in the days of these four
individuals of the high-priestly house. If Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan,
and Jaddua were all alive at the same time, this, the most natural view,
must also be the correct one, because in each of the other lists of the
same chapter, the times of only one high priest are mentioned, and at
the close of the list, [Neh 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026.md), it
is expressly stated that the (previously enrolled) Levites were chiefs
in the days of Joiakim, Ezra, and Nehemiah. It is not, moreover,
difficult to prove that Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were
living contemporaneously. For Eliashib, whom Nehemiah found high priest
at his arrival at Jerusalem ([Neh
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001).md), being the grandson of Joshua,
who returned from Babylon in the year 536 with Zerubbabel, would in 445
be anything but a young man. Indeed, he must then have been about
seventy-five years old. Moreover, it appears from [Jos
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004.md) and [Jos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007.md), that in 433, when Nehemiah
returned to Artaxerxes, he was still in office, though on Nehemiah's
return he was no longer alive, and that he therefore died soon after
433, at the age of about ninety. If, however, this was his age when he
died, his son Joiada might then be already sixty-three, his grandson
Johanan thirty-six, his great-grandson Jaddua nine, if each were
respectively born in the twenty-seventh year of his father's lifetime.

(Note: If Jaddua were on the death of his great-great-grandfather
(between 433 and 430 b.c.) about ten years old, he might also live to
witness the appearance of Alexander the Great before Jerusalem, 330 b.c.
(mentioned by Josephus, Ant. xi. 8. 4), since he would then have
attained the age of 110, which does not seem incredible, when it is
considered that Jehoiada, the high priest in the reign of Joash, was 130
when he died ([Ch2 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015))..md)

The view (of [Neh 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011.md), [Neh
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012.md), and [Neh
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022).md) just stated, is confirmed both
by [Neh 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022.md) and [Neh
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#023.md), and by [Neh
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#028.md). According to [Neh
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#022.md), the chiefs or heads of the
priestly houses were enrolled under the government of Darius the
Persian. Now there is no doubt that this Darius is Darius Nothus, the
successor of Artaxerxes Longimanus, who reigned from 424 to 404. The
notion that Darius Codomanus is intended, rests upon the mistaken view
that in [Neh 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#011.md) Jaddua is mentioned
as the high priest already in office. According to [Neh
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023.md), the heads of the houses of the
Levites were enrolled in the book of the Chronicles even until the days
of Johanan the son of Eliashib. The days of Johanan - that is, the
period of his high-priesthood - are here named as the latest date to
which the author of this book extends the genealogical lists of the
Levites. And this well agrees with the information, [Neh
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#018.md), that during Nehemiah's absence
at Jerusalem, one of the sons of Joiada the high priest allied himself
by marriage with Sanballat the Horonite, i.e., married one of his
daughters, and was driven away by Nehemiah. If Joiada had even in the
days of Nehemiah a married son, Johanan the first-born son of Joiada,
the presumptive successor to the high-priesthood, might well have been
at that time so long a married man as to have already witnessed the
birth of his son Jaddua.

To complete our proof that the contents of Neh 12 do not extend to a
period subsequent to Nehemiah, we have still to discuss the question,
how long he held office in Judaea, and when he wrote the book in which
he relates what he there effected. Both these questions can be answered
with sufficient accuracy for our purpose, though the exact year cannot
be named. Concerning the time he held office in Jerusalem, he only
remarks in his book that he was governor from the twentieth to the
thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, and that in the thirty-second year of
that monarch he again returned to the court, and afterwards, ימים לקץ,
came back to Jerusalem ([Neh 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014.md), and
[Neh 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006).md). The term ימים לקץ is very
indefinite; but the interpretation, "at the end of the year," is
incorrect and unsupported. It is quite evident, from the irregularities
and transgressions of the law which occurred in the community during his
absence from Jerusalem, that Nehemiah must have remained longer than a
year at the court, and, indeed, that he did not return for some years.
Besides the withholding of the dues to the Levites ([Neh
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010)..md) and the desecration of the
Sabbath ([Neh 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015)..md), -
transgressions of the law which might have occurred soon after
Nehemiah's departure, - Eliashib had not only the priest fitted up a
chamber in the fore-court of the temple as a dwelling for his connection
Tobiah ([Neh 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004).md), but Jews had also
married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab, and had children by them who
spake not the Jews' language, but only that of Ashdod, in the interval
([Neh 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023).md). These facts presuppose
an absence of several years on the part of Nehemiah, even if many of
these unlawful marriages had been previously contracted, and only came
to his knowledge after his return. - Neither are there adequate grounds
for the notion that Nehemiah lived but a short time after his return to
Jerusalem. The suppression of these infringements of the law, which is
narrated Neh 13:7-31, might, indeed, have been accomplished in a few
months; but we are by no means justified in inferring that this was the
last of his labours for the welfare of his fellow-countrymen, and that
his own life terminated soon after, because he relates nothing more than
his procedure against these transgressions. After the removal of these
irregularities, and the re-establishment of legal order in divine
worship and social life, he might have lived for a long period at
Jerusalem without effecting anything, the record of which it might be
important to hand down to posterity. If we suppose him to have been from
thirty-five to forty years of age when, being cupbearer to Artaxerxes,
he was sent at his own request, in the twentieth year of that monarch's
reign (445 b.c.), as governor to Judah, he might well have exercised his
office in Judah and Jerusalem from thirty-five to forty years, including
his journey back to the court in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes,
i.e., till 405 b.c. This would make him live till the nineteenth year of
Darius Nothus, and not die till he was from seventy-five to eighty years
of age. If we further suppose that he composed this book some ten years
before his death, i.e., thirty years after his first arrival at
Jerusalem, when he had, as far as lay in his power, arranged the affairs
of Judah, it would then be possible for him to relate and describe all
that is contained in the canonical book of Nehemiah. For in the year 415
b.c., i.e., in the ninth year of Darius Nothus, genealogical lists of
priests and Levites of the time of Joiakim the high priest, reaching
down to the days of Johanan the son (grandson) of Eliashib, and of the
time of the reign of Darius Nothus, might already be written in the book
of the Chronicles, as mentioned [Neh
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#023.md), compared with [Neh
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022.md) and [Neh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026.md). Then, too, the high priest
Joiada might already have been dead, his son Johanan have succeeded to
the office, and Jaddua, the son of the latter, have already attained the
age of twenty-five. - This book would consequently contain no historical
information and no single remark which Nehemiah might not himself have
written. Hence the contents of the book itself furnish not the slightest
opposition to the view that the whole was the work of Nehemiah.

When, however, we turn our attention to its form, that unity of
character to which modern criticism attaches so much importance seems to
be wanting in the second half. We have, however, already remarked that
neither the lack of prominence given to the person of Nehemiah, nor the
circumstance that he is in these chapters spoken of in the third person,
furnish incontestable arguments against the integrity of this book. For
in the section concerning the dedication of the wall, Neh 12:27-43,
Nehemiah's authorship of which no critic has as yet impugned, he only
brings himself forward ([Neh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#031.md) and
[Neh 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#038).md) when mentioning what he
had himself appointed and done, while the rest of the narrative is not
in the communicative form of speech: we sought the Levites, we offered,
etc., which he employs in the account of the making of a covenant, but
in the objective form: they sought the Levites, they offered, etc. ([Neh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027.md) and [Neh
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#043).md). The want of connection between
the several sections seems to us far more striking. Chs. 8-10 form,
indeed, a connected section, the commencement of which ([Neh
7:73](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073).md) by the circumstantial clause,
"when the children of Israel dwelt in their cities," combines it, even
by a repetition of the very form of words, which the preceding list; but
the commencement of Neh 11 is somewhat abrupt, while between [Neh
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011.md) and [Neh
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012.md) and between [Neh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026.md) and [Neh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027.md) of Neh 12 there is nothing to
mark the connection. This gives the sections, chs. 8-10 and 12:1-26, the
appearance of being subsequent interpolations or insertions in
Nehemiah's record; and there is thus much of real foundation for this
appearance, that this book is not a continuous narrative or description
of Nehemiah's proceedings in Judah, - historical, topographical, and
genealogical lists, which interrupt the thread of the history, being
inserted in it. But it by no means follows, that because such is the
nature of the book, the inserted portions must therefore have been the
subsequent interpolations of another hand, in the record composed by
Nehemiah. This inference of modern criticism is based upon an erroneous
conception of the nature and intention of this book, which is first of
all regarded, if not as a biography or diary of Nehemiah, yet as a
"record," in which is noted down only the most important facts
concerning his journey to Jerusalem and his proceedings there. For this
preconception, neither the canonical book of Nehemiah, nor a comparison
of those sections which are universally admitted to be his, furnish any
adequate support. For with regard, first, to these sections, it is
obvious from [Neh 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014.md), where Nehemiah
during the building of the wall reproaches the usurers, saying, "From
the time that I was appointed to be governor in the land of Judah, from
the twentieth to the two-and-thirtieth year of Artaxerxes, that is,
twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the
governor," that Nehemiah wrote the account of his labours in Judah from
memory after the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes. When we compare with
this the manner in which he speaks quite incidentally ([Neh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006)..md) of his absence from Jerusalem
and his journey to the court, in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes,
and connects the account of the chamber vacated for Tobiah in the
fore-court of the temple ([Neh 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004).md)
with the previous narrative of the public reading of the law and the
severance of the strangers from Israel by the formula מזּה ולפני, "and
before this," making it appear as though this public reading of the law
and severance of strangers had followed his return from the court; and
further, consider that the public reading of the law mentioned, [Neh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001.md), is combined with the section,
[Neh 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044.md), and this section again
([Neh 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044).md) with the account of the
dedication of the wall by the formula, "at that time;" it is undoubtedly
obvious that Nehemiah did not write his whole work till the evening of
his days, and after he had accomplished all that was most important in
the labours he undertook for Jerusalem and his fellow-countrymen, and
that he makes no decided distinction between his labours during his
second sojourn at Jerusalem and those of his former stay of twelve
years.

If, then, these circumstances indisputably show that the work composed
by Nehemiah himself did not bear the form of a diary, the admission into
it of the list of those who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and
Joshua (Neh 7:6-73) makes it manifest that it was not his intention to
give an unbroken narrative, of his efforts and their results in
Jerusalem. This list, moreover, which he found when occupied with his
plan for increasing the population of Jerusalem, is shown by the words,
"I found therein written," to have been admitted by himself into his
work, and inserted in his account of what God had put it into his heart
to do with respect to the peopling of Jerusalem ([Neh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005).md), and of the manner in which he
had carried out his resolution ([Neh
11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001).md), as a valuable document with
respect to the history of the community, although the continuous thread
of the narrative was broken by the interpolation. From his admission of
this list, we may infer that he also incorporated other not less
important documents, such as the lists of the priests and Levites, Neh
12:1-26, in his book, without troubling himself about the continuous
progress of the historical narrative, because it was his purpose not
merely to portray his own labours in Jerusalem, but to describe the
development and circumstances of the reinstated community under his own
and Ezra's leadership.

(Note: "Nehmie," remarks Ed. Barde in his Etude critique et exegetique,
p. 48, "n'crit pas sa biographie: son but est l'histoire de la
restauration de Jrusalem et du culte, pour montrer l'accomplissement des
promesses de Dieu.")

This being the case, there can be no reason whatever for denying
Nehemiah's authorship of the account of the religious solemnities in
chs. 8-10, especially as the communicative form in which the narrative
is written, bears witness that one of the leaders of that assembly of
the people composed this account of it, and the expression, "we will not
forsake the house of our God," with which it closes ([Neh
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#039).md), is a form of speech peculiar
to Nehemiah, and repeated by him [Neh
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#011.md). Such considerations seem to us
to do away with any doubts which may have been raised as to the
integrity of the whole book, and the authorship of Nehemiah.
