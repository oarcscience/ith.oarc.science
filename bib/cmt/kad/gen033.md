### [Genesis Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 33:1</span></span>

Meeting with Esau. - As Jacob went forward, he saw Esau coming to meet
him with his 400 mean. He then arranged his wives and children in such a
manner, that the maids with their children went first, Leah with hers in
the middle, and Rachel with Joseph behind, thus forming a long
procession. But he himself went in front, and met Esau with sevenfold
obeisance. ארצה ישׁתּחוּ does not denote complete prostration, like ארצה
אפּים in [Gen 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md), but a deep
Oriental bow, in which the head approaches the ground, but does not
touch it. By this manifestation of deep reverence, Jacob hoped to win
his brother's heart. He humbled himself before him as the elder, with
the feeling that he had formerly sinned against him. Esau, on the other
hand, "had a comparatively better, but not so tender a conscience." At
the sight of Jacob he was carried away by the natural feelings of
brotherly affection, and running up to him, embraced him, fell on his
neck, and kissed him; and they both wept. The puncta extraordinaria
above ישּׁקהוּ are probably intended to mark the word as suspicious.
They "are like a note of interrogation, questioning the genuineness of
this kiss; but without any reason" (Del.). Even if there was still some
malice in Esau's heart, it was overcome by the humility with which his
brother met him, so that he allowed free course to the generous emotions
of his heart; all the more, because the "roving life" which suited his
nature had procured him such wealth and power, that he was quite equal
to his brother in earthly possessions.

[Genesis 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 33:5</span></span>

When his eyes fell upon the women and children, he inquired respecting
them, "Whom hast thou here?" And Jacob replied, "The children with whom
Elohim hath favoured me." Upon this, the mothers and their children
approached in order, making reverential obeisance. חנן with double acc.
"graciously to present." Elohim: "to avoid reminding Esau of the
blessing of Jehovah, which had occasioned his absence" (Del.).

[Genesis 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 33:8</span></span>

And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

Esau then inquired about the camp that had met him, i.e., the presents
of cattle that were sent to meet him, and refused to accept them, until
Jacob's urgent persuasion eventually induced him to do so.

[Genesis 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 33:10</span></span>

"For therefore," sc., to be able to offer thee this present, "have I
come to see thy face, as man seeth the face of God, and thou hast
received me favourably." The thought is this: In thy countenance I have
been met with divine (heavenly) friendliness (cf. [Sa1
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#009.md); [Sa2
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#017).md). Jacob might say this without
cringing, since he "must have discerned the work of God in the
unexpected change in his brother's disposition towards him, and in his
brother's friendliness a reflection of this divine."

[Genesis 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 33:11</span></span>

Blessing: i.e., the present, expressive of his desire to bless, as in
[Sa1 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#027.md); [Sa1
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#026.md). הבאת: for הבאה, as in [Deu
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#029.md); [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md), etc.; sometimes also in verbs
הל, [Lev 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#021.md); [Lev
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md). כל ישׁ־לי: "I have all" (not
all kinds of things); viz as the heir of the divine promise.

[Genesis 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 33:12</span></span>

Lastly, Esau proposed to accompany Jacob on his journey. But Jacob
politely declined not only his own company, but also the escort, which
Esau afterwards offered him, of a portion of his attendants; the latter
as being unnecessary, the former as likely to be injurious to his
flocks. This did not spring from any feeling of distrust; and the ground
assigned was no mere pretext. He needed no military guard, "for he knew
that he was defended by the hosts of God;" and the reason given was a
very good one: "My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the
flocks and herds that are milking (עלות from עוּל, giving milk or
suckling) are upon me" (עלי): i.e., because they are giving milk they
are an object of especial anxiety to me; "and if one should overdrive
them a single day, all the sheep would die." A caravan, with delicate
children and cattle that required care, could not possibly keep pace
with Esau and his horsemen, without taking harm. And Jacob could not
expect his brother to accommodate himself to the rate at which he was
travelling. For this reason he wished Esau to go on first; and he would
drive gently behind, "according to the foot of the cattle (מלאכה
possessions = cattle), and according to the foot of the children," i.e.,
"according to the pace at which the cattle and the children could go"
(Luther). "Till I come to my lord to Seir:" these words are not to be
understood as meaning that he intended to go direct to Seir;
consequently they were not a wilful deception for the purpose of getting
rid of Esau. Jacob's destination was Canaan, and in Canaan probably
Hebron, where his father Isaac still lived. From thence he may have
thought of paying a visit to Esau in Seir. Whether he carried out this
intention or not, we cannot tell; for we have not a record of all that
Jacob did, but only of the principal events of his life. We afterwards
find them both meeting together as friends at their father's funeral
([Gen 35:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#029).md). Again, the attitude of
inferiority which Jacob assumed in his conversation with Esau,
addressing him as lord, and speaking of himself as servant, was simply
an act of courtesy suited to the circumstances, in which he paid to Esau
the respect due to the head of a powerful band; since he could not
conscientiously have maintained the attitude of a brother, when inwardly
and spiritually, in spite of Esau's friendly meeting, they were so
completely separated the one from the other.

[Genesis 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 33:16</span></span>

Esau set off the same day for Mount Seir, whilst Jacob proceeded to
Succoth, where he built himself a house and made succoth for his flocks,
i.e., probably not huts of branches and shrubs, but hurdles or folds
made of twigs woven together. According to [Jos
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027.md), Succoth was in the valley of
the Jordan, and was allotted to the tribe of Gad, as part of the
district of the Jordan, "on the other side Jordan eastward;" and this is
confirmed by [Jdg 8:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#004.md), and by Jerome
(quaest. ad h. l.): Sochoth usque hodie civitas trans Jordanem in parte
Scythopoleos. Consequently it cannot be identified with the Scut on the
western side of the Jordan, to the south of Beisan, above the Wady el
Mlih. - How long Jacob remained in Succoth cannot be determined; but we
may conclude that he stayed there some years from the circumstance, that
by erecting a house and huts he prepared for a lengthened stay. The
motives which induced him to remain there are also unknown to us. But
when Knobel adduces the fact, that Jacob came to Canaan for the purpose
of visiting Isaac ([Gen 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#018).md), as a
reason why it is improbable that he continued long at Succoth, he
forgets that Jacob could visit his father from Succoth just as well as
from Shechem, and that, with the number of people and cattle that he had
about him, it was impossible that he should join and subordinate himself
to Isaac's household, after having attained through his past life and
the promises of God a position of patriarchal independence.

[Genesis 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 33:18</span></span>

From Succoth, Jacob crossed a ford of the Jordan, and "came in safety to
the city of Sichem in the land of Canaan." שׁלם is not a proper name
meaning "to Shalem," as it is rendered by Luther (and Eng. Vers., Tr.)
after the lxx, Vulg., etc.; but an adjective, safe, peaceful, equivalent
to בּשׁלום, "in peace," in [Gen 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#021.md),
to which there is an evident allusion. What Jacob had asked for in his
vow at Bethel, before his departure from Canaan, was now fulfilled. He
had returned in safety "to the land of Canaan;" Succoth, therefore, did
not belong to the land of Canaan, but must have been on the eastern side
of the Jordan. שׁכם עיר, lit., city of Shechem; so called from Shechem
the son of the Hivite prince Hamor

(Note: Mamortha, which according to Plin. (h. n. v. 14) was the earlier
name of Neapolis (Nablus), appears to have been a corruption of Chamor.)

([Gen 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019.md), [Gen
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002)..md), who founded it and called it
by the name of his son, since it was not in existence in Abraham's time
(vid., [Gen 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006).md). Jacob pitched his
tent before the town, and then bought the piece of ground upon which he
encamped from the sons of Hamor for 100 Kesita. קשׂיטה is not a piece of
silver of the value of a lamb (according to the ancient versions), but a
quantity of silver weighed out, of considerable, though not exactly
determinable value: cf. Ges. thes. s. v. This purchase showed that
Jacob, in reliance upon the promise of God, regarded Canaan as his own
home and the home of his seed. This piece of field, which fell to the
lot of the sons of Joseph, and where Joseph's bones were buried ([Jos
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#032).md), was, according to tradition,
the plain which stretches out at the south-eastern opening of the valley
of Shechem, where Jacob's well is still pointed out ([Joh
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#006).md), also Joseph's grave, a Mahometan
wely (grave) two or three hundred paces to the north (Rob. Pal. iii.
95ff.). Jacob also erected an altar, as Abraham had previously done
after his entrance into Canaan ([Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007).md), and called it El-Elohe-Israel,
"God (the mighty) is the God of Israel," to set forth in this name the
spiritual acquisition of his previous life, and according to his vow
([Gen 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#021).md) to give glory to the "God
of Israel" (as he called Jehovah, with reference to the name given to
him at [Gen 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#029).md), for having proved
Himself to be El, a mighty God, during his long absence, and that it
might serve as a memorial for his descendants.
