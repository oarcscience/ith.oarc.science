IX\. History Of Esau - Genesis 36

"Esau and Jacob shook hands once more over the corpse of their father.
Henceforth their paths diverged, to meet no more" (Del.). As Esau had
also received a divine promise ([Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023)), and the history of his tribe
was already interwoven in the paternal blessing with that of Israel
([Gen 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029) and [Gen
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040)), an account is given in the
book of Genesis of his growth into a nation; and a separate section is
devoted to this, which, according to the invariable plan of the book,
precedes the tholedoth of Jacob. The account is subdivided into the
following sections, which are distinctly indicated by their respective
headings. (Compare with these the parallel list in 1 Chron 1:35-54.)

[Genesis 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 36:1</span></span>

Esau's Wives and Children. His Settlement in the Mountains of Seir. - In
the heading ([Gen 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001)) the surname
Edom is added to the name Esau, which he received at his birth, because
the former became the national designation of his descendants. - [Gen
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002), [Gen
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#003). The names of Esau's three wives
differ from those given in the previous accounts ([Gen
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034) and [Gen
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#009)), and in one instance the
father's name as well. The daughter of Elon the Hittite is called Adah
(the ornament), and in [Gen 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034)
Basmath (the fragrant); the second is called Aholibamah (probably
tent-height), the daughter of Anah, daughter, i.e., grand-daughter of
Zibeon the Hivite, and in [Gen 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034),
Jehudith (the praised or praiseworthy), daughter of Beeri the Hittite;
the third, the daughter of Ishmael, is called Basmath here and Mahalath
in [Gen 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#009). This difference arose
from the fact, that Moses availed himself of genealogical documents for
Esau's family and tribe, and inserted them without alteration. It
presents no irreconcilable discrepancy, therefore, but may be explained
from the ancient custom in the East, of giving surnames, as the Arabs
frequently do still, founded upon some important or memorable event in a
man's life, which gradually superseded the other name (e.g., the name
Edom, as explained in [Gen 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#030));
whilst as a rule the women received new names when they were married
(cf. Chardin, Hengstenberg, Dissertations, vol. ii. p. 223-6). The
different names given for the father of Aholibamah or Judith,
Hengstenberg explains by referring to the statement in [Gen
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024), that Anah, the son of Zibeon,
while watching the asses of his father in the desert, discovered the
warm springs (of Calirrhoe), on which he founds the acute conjecture,
that from this discovery Anah received the surname Beeri, i.e.,
spring-man, which so threw his original name into the shade, as to be
the only name given in the genealogical table. There is no force in the
objection, that according to [Gen
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#025) Aholibamah was not a daughter of
the discoverer of the springs, but of his uncle of the same name. For
where is it stated that the Aholibamah mentioned in [Gen
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#025) was Esau's wife? And is it a
thing unheard of that aunt and niece should have the same name? If
Zibeon gave his second son the name of his brother Anah (cf. [Gen
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024) and [Gen
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020)), why could not his son Anah
have named his daughter after his cousin, the daughter of his father's
brother? The reception of Aholibamah into the list of the Seirite
princes is no proof that she was Esau's wife, but may be much more
naturally supposed to have arisen from the same (unknown) circumstance
as that which caused one of the seats of the Edomitish Alluphim to be
called by her name ([Gen 36:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#041)). -
Lastly, the remaining diversity, viz., that Anah is called a Hivite in
[Gen 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002) and a Hittite in [Gen
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034), is not to be explained by the
conjecture, that for Hivite we should read Horite, according to [Gen
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020), but by the simple assumption
that Hittite is used in [Gen 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034)
sensu latiori for Canaanite, according to the analogy of [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004); [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029); [Kg2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006); just as the two Hittite wives of
Esau are called daughters of Canaan in [Gen
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#008). For the historical account, the
general name Hittite sufficed; but the genealogical list required the
special name of the particular branch of the Canaanitish tribes, viz.,
the Hivites. In just as simple a manner may the introduction of the
Hivite Zibeon among the Horites of Seir ([Gen
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020) and [Gen
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024)) be explained, viz., on the
supposition that the removed to the mountains of Seir, and there became
a Horite, i.e., a troglodyte, or dweller in a cave. - The names of
Esau's sons occur again in [Ch1 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#035).
The statement in [Gen 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006), [Gen
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#007), that Esau went with his family
and possessions, which he had acquired in Canaan, into the land of Seir,
from before his brother Jacob, does not imply (in contradiction to [Gen
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#004); [Gen
33:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#014)) that he did not leave the
land of Canaan till after Jacob's return. The words may be understood
without difficulty as meaning, that after founding a house of his own,
when his family and flocks increased, Esau sought a home in Seir,
because he knew that Jacob, as the heir, would enter upon the family
possessions, but without waiting till he returned and actually took
possession. In the clause "went into the country" ([Gen
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006)), the name Seir or Edom (cf. [Gen
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#016)) must have dropt out, as the
words "into the country" convey no sense when standing by themselves.

[Genesis 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 36:9</span></span>

(cf. [Ch1 1:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#036)). Esau's Sons and
Grandsons as Fathers of Tribes. - Through them he became the father of
Edom, i.e., the founder of the Edomitish nation on the mountains of
Seir. Mouth Seir is the mountainous region between the Dead Sea and the
Elanitic Gulf, the northern half of which is called Jebl (Γεβαλήνη) by
the Arabs, the southern half, Sherah (Rob. Pal. ii. 552). - In the case
of two of the wives of Esau, who bore only one son each, the tribes were
founded not by the sons, but by the grandsons; but in that of Aholibamah
the three sons were the founders. Among the sons of Eliphaz we find
Amalek, whose mother was Timna, the concubine of Eliphaz. He was the
ancestor of the Amalekites, who attacked the Israelites at Horeb as they
came out of Egypt under Moses ([Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008).), and not merely of a mixed
tribe of Amalekites and Edomites, belonging to the supposed aboriginal
Amalekite nation. For the Arabic legend of Amlik as an aboriginal tribe
of Arabia is far too recent, confused, and contradictory to
counterbalance the clear testimony of the record before us. The allusion
to the fields of the Amalekites in [Gen
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007) does not imply that the tribe was
in existence in Abraham's time, nor does the expression "first of the
nations," in the saying of Balaam ([Num
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020)), represent Amalek as the
aboriginal or oldest tribe, but simply as the first heathen tribe by
which Israel was attacked. The Old Testament says nothing of any fusion
of Edomites or Horites with Amalekites, nor does it mention a double
Amalek (cf. Hengstenberg, Dissertations 2, 247ff., and Kurtz, History i.
122, 3, ii. 240ff.).

(Note: The occurrence of "Timna and Amalek" in [Ch1
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#036), as coordinate with the sons of
Eliphaz, is simply a more concise form of saying "and from Timna,
Amalek.")

If there had been an Amalek previous to Edom, with the important part
which they took in opposition to Israel even in the time of Moses, the
book of Genesis would not have omitted to give their pedigree in the
list of the nations. At a very early period the Amalekites separated
from the other tribes of Edom and formed an independent people, having
their headquarters in the southern part of the mountains of Judah, as
far as Kadesh ([Gen 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007); [Num
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029); [Num
14:43](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#043), [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045)), but, like the Bedouins,
spreading themselves as a nomad tribe over the whole of the northern
portion of Arabia Petraea, from Havilah to Shur on the border of Egypt
([Sa1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003), [Sa1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007); [Sa1
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008)); whilst one branch penetrated
into the heart of Canaan, so that a range of hills, in what was
afterwards the inheritance of Ephraim, bore the name of mountains of the
Amalekites ([Jdg 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#015), cf. [Gen
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#014)). Those who settled in Arabia
seem also to have separated in the course of time into several branches,
so that Amalekite hordes invaded the land of Israel in connection
sometimes with the Midianites and the sons of the East (the Arabs, [Jdg
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003); [Jdg
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#012)), and at other times with the
Ammonites ([Jdg 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013)). After they had
been defeated by Saul ([Sa1 14:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#048);
[Sa1 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#002).), and frequently chastised
by David ([Sa1 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008); [Sa1
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001).; [Sa2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012)), the remnant of them was
exterminated under Hezekiah by the Simeonites on the mountains of Seir
([Ch1 4:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#042)).

[Genesis 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 36:15</span></span>

The Tribe-Princes Who Descended from Esau. - אלּוּפים was the
distinguishing title of the Edomite and Horite phylarchs; and it is only
incidentally that it is applied to Jewish heads of tribes in [Zac
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#007), and [Zac
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#005). It is probably derived from אלף
or אלפים, equivalent to משׁפּחות, families ([Sa1
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#019); [Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002)), - the heads of the families,
i.e., of the principal divisions, of the tribe. The names of these
Alluphim are not names of places, but of persons-of the three sons and
ten grandsons of Esau mentioned in [Gen
36:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#009); though Knobel would reverse
the process and interpret the whole geographically. - In [Gen
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#016) Korah has probably been copied
by mistake from [Gen 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#018), and should
therefore be erased, as it really is in the Samar. Codex.

[Genesis 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 36:20</span></span>

(parallel, [Ch1 1:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#038)). Descendants
of Seir the Horite; - the inhabitants of the land, or pre-Edomitish
population of the country. - "The Horite:" ὁ Τρωγλοδύτης, the dweller in
caves, which abound in the mountains of Edom (vid., Rob. Pal. ii. p.
424). The Horites, who had previously been an independent people ([Gen
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006)), were partly exterminated and
partly subjugated by the descendants of Esau ([Deu
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012), [Deu
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#022)). Seven sons of Seir are given as
tribe-princes of the Horites, who are afterwards mentioned as Alluphim
([Gen 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#029), [Gen
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#030)), also their sons, as well as
two daughters, Timna ([Gen 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#022)) and
Aholibamah ([Gen 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#025)), who obtained
notoriety from the face that two of the headquarters of Edomitish
tribe-princes bore their names ([Gen
36:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#040) and [Gen
36:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#041)). Timna was probably the same as
the concubine of Eliphaz ([Gen 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012));
but Aholibamah was not the wife of Esau (cf. [Gen
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002)). - There are a few instances in
which the names in this list differ from those in the Chronicles. But
they are differences which either consist of variation in form, or have
arisen from mistakes in copying.

(Note: Knobel also undertakes to explain these names geographically, and
to point them out in tribes and places of Arabia, assuming, quite
arbitrarily and in opposition to the text, that the names refer to
tribes, not to persons, although an incident is related of Zibeon's son,
which proves at once that the list relates to persons and not to tribes;
and expecting his readers to believe that not only are the descendants
of these troglodytes, who were exterminated before the time of Moses,
still to be found, but even their names may be traced in certain Bedouin
tribes, though more than 3000 years have passed away! The utter
groundlessness of such explanations, which rest upon nothing more than
similarity of names, may be seen in the association of Shobal with Syria
Sobal (Judith 3:1), the name used by the Crusaders for Arabia tertia,
i.e., the southernmost district below the Dead Sea, which was conquered
by them. For notwithstanding the resemblance of the name Shobal to
Sobal, no one could seriously think of connecting Syria Sobal with the
Horite prince Shobal, unless he was altogether ignorant of the
apocryphal origin of the former name, which first of all arose from the
Greek or Latin version of the Old Testament, and in fact from a
misunderstanding of [Psa 60:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002), where,
instead צובה ארם, Aram Zobah, we find in the lxx Συριά Σοβάλ, and in the
Vulg. Syria et Sobal.)

Of Anah, the son of Zibeon, it is related ([Gen
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024)), that as he fed the asses of
his father in the desert, he "found היּמם" - not "he invented mules," as
the Talmud, Luther, etc., render it, for mules are פּרדים, and מצא does
not mean to invent; but he discovered aquae calidae (Vulg.), either the
hot sulphur spring of Calirrhoe in the Wady Zerka Maein (vid., [Gen
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#019)), or those in the Wady el Ahsa
to the S.E. of the Dead Sea, or those in the Wady Hamad between Kerek
and the Dead Sea.

(Note: It is possible that there may be something significant in the
fact that it was "as he was feeding his father's asses," and that the
asses may have contributed to the discovery; just as the whirlpool of
Karlsbad is said to have been discovered through a hound of Charles IV,
which pursued a stag into a hot spring, and attracted the huntsmen to
the spot by its howling.)

[Genesis 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 36:30</span></span>

"These are the princes of the Horites according to their princes," i.e.,
as their princes were individually named in the land of Seir. ל in
enumerations indicates the relation of the individual to the whole, and
of the whole to the individual.

[Genesis 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 36:31</span></span>

(Parallel, [Ch1 1:43-50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#043)). The Kings in
the Land of Edom: before the children of Israel had a king. It is to be
observed in connection with the eight kings mentioned here, that whilst
they follow one another, that is to say, one never comes to the throne
till his predecessor is dead, yet the son never succeeds the father, but
they all belong to different families and places, and in the case of the
last the statement that "he died" is wanting. From this it is
unquestionably obvious, that the sovereignty was elective; that the
kings were chosen by the phylarchs; and, as [Isa
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#012) also shows, that they lived or
reigned contemporaneously with these. The contemporaneous existence of
the Alluphim and the kings may also be inferred from [Exo
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015) as compared with [Num
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014). Whilst it was with the king of
Edom that Moses treated respecting the passage through the land, in the
song of Moses it is the princes who tremble with fear on account of the
miraculous passage through the Red Sea (cf. [Eze
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#029)). Lastly, this is also supported
by the fact, that the account of the seats of the phylarchs ([Gen
36:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#040)) follows the list of the
kings. This arrangement would have been thoroughly unsuitable if the
monarchy had been founded upon the ruins of the phylarchs (vid.,
Hengstenberg, ut sup. pp. 238ff.). Of all the kings of Edom, not one is
named elsewhere. It is true, the attempt has been made to identify the
fourth, Hadad ([Gen 36:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#035)), with the
Edomite Hadad who rose up against Solomon ([Kg1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014)); but without foundation. The
contemporary of Solomon was of royal blood, but neither a king nor a
pretender; our Hadad, on the contrary, was a king, but he was the son of
an unknown Hadad of the town of Avith, and no relation to his
predecessor Husham of the country of the Temanites. It is related of him
that he smote Midian in the fields of Moab ([Gen
36:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#035)); from which Hengstenberg (pp.
235-6) justly infers that this event cannot have been very remote from
the Mosaic age, since we find the Midianites allied to the Moabites in
Num 22; whereas afterwards, viz., in the time of Gideon, the Midianites
vanished from history, and in Solomon's days the fields of Moab, being
Israelitish territory, cannot have served as a field of battle for the
Midianites and Moabites. - Of the tribe-cities of these kings only a few
can be identified now. Bozrah, a noted city of the Edomites ([Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006); [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001), etc.), is still to be traced in
el Buseireh, a village with ruins in Jebal (Rob. Pal. ii. 571). - The
land of the Temanite ([Gen 36:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#034)) is a
province in northern Idumaea, with a city, Teman, which has not yet been
discovered; according to Jerome, quinque millibus from Petra. - Rehoboth
of the river ([Gen 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#037)) can neither
be the Idumaean Robotha, nor er Ruheibeh in the wady running towards el
Arish, but must be sought for on the Euphrates, say in Errachabi or
Rachabeh, near the mouth of the Chaboras. Consequently Saul, who sprang
from Rehoboth, was a foreigner. - Of the last king, Hadar ([Gen
36:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#039); not Hadad, as it is written in
[Ch1 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#050)), the wife, the
mother-in-law, and the mother are mentioned: his death is not mentioned
here, but is added by the later chronicler ([Ch1
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#051)). This can be explained easily
enough from the simple fact, that at the time when the table was first
drawn up, Hadad was still alive and seated upon the throne. In all
probability, therefore, Hadad was the king of Edom, to whom Moses
applied for permission to pass through the land ([Num
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014).).

(Note: If this be admitted; then, on the supposition that this list of
kings contains all the previous kings of Edom, the introduction of
monarchy among the Edomites can hardly have taken place more than 200
years before the exodus; and, in that case, none of the phylarchs named
in [Gen 36:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015) can have lived to see
its establishment. For the list only reaches to the grandsons of Esau,
none of whom are likely to have lived more than 100 or 150 years after
Esau's death. It is true we do not know when Esau died; but 413 years
elapsed between the death of Jacob and the exodus, and Joseph, who was
born in the 91st years of Jacob's life, died 54 years afterwards, i.e.,
359 years before the exodus. But Esau was married in his 40th year, 37
years before Jacob ([Gen 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034)), and
had sons and daughters before his removal to Seir ([Gen
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006)). Unless, therefore, his sons and
grandsons attained a most unusual age, or were married remarkably late
in life, his grandsons can hardly have outlived Joseph more than 100
years. Now, if we fix their death at about 250 years before the exodus
of Israel from Egypt, there remains from that point to the arrival of
the Israelites at the land of Edom ([Num
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014)) a period of 290 years; amply
sufficient for the reigns of eight kings, even if the monarchy was not
introduced till after the death of the last of the phylarchs mentioned
in [Gen 36:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015).)

At any rate the list is evidently a record relating to the Edomitish
kings of a pre-Mosaic age. But if this is the case, the heading, "These
are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any
king over the children of Israel," does not refer to the time when the
monarchy was introduced into Israel under Saul, but was written with the
promise in mind, that kings should come out of the loins of Jacob ([Gen
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#011), cf. [Gen
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004).), and merely expresses the
thought, that Edom became a kingdom at an earlier period than Israel.
Such a thought was by no means inappropriate to the Mosaic age. For the
idea, "that Israel was destined to grow into a kingdom with monarchs of
his own family, was a hope handed down to the age of Moses, which the
long residence in Egypt was well adapted to foster" (Del.).

(Parallel, [Ch1 1:51-54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#051)). Seats of the
Tribe-Princes of Esau According to Their Families. - That the names
which follow are not a second list of Edomitish tribe-princes (viz., of
those who continued the ancient constitution, with its hereditary
aristocracy, after Hadar's death), but merely relate to the capital
cities of the old phylarchs, is evident from the expression in the
heading, "After their places, by their names," as compared with [Gen
36:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#043), "According to their habitations
in the land of their possession." This being the substance and intention
of the list, there is nothing surprising in the fact, that out of the
eleven names only two correspond to those given in [Gen
36:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015). This proves nothing more
than that only two of the capitals received their names from the princes
who captured or founded them, viz., Timnah and Kenaz. Neither of these
has been discovered yet. The name Aholibamah is derived from the Horite
princess ([Gen 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#025)); its site is
unknown. Elah is the port Aila (vid., [Gen
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006)). Pinon is the same as Phunon, an
encampment of the Israelites ([Num
33:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#042)), celebrated for its mines,
in which many Christians were condemned to labour under Diocletian,
between Petra and Zoar, to the northeast of Wady Musa. Teman is the
capital of the land of the Temanites ([Gen
36:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#034)). Mibzar is supposed by Knobel
to be Petra; but this is called Selah elsewhere ([Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007)). Magdiel and Iram cannot be
identified. The concluding sentence, "This is Esau, the father (founder)
of Edom" (i.e., from his sprang the great nation of the Edomites, with
its princes and kings, upon the mountains of Seir), not only terminates
this section, but prepared the way for the history of Jacob, which
commences with the following chapter.
