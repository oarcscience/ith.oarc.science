Prayer for a Renewal of the Mercies of David

After having recognised the fact that the double inscription of Ps 88
places two irreconcilable statements concerning the origin of that Psalm
side by side, we renounce the artifices by which Ethan (איתן)

(Note: This name איתן is also Phoenician in the form יתן, Itan, Ἰτανός;
ליתן, litan, is Phoenician, and equivalent to לעלם.))

the Ezrahite, of the tribe of Judah ([Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011.md) [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md), [Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006).md), is made to be one and the same
person with Ethan (Jeduthun) the son of Kushaiah the Merarite, of the
tribe of Levi ([Ch1 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017.md); [Ch1
6:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#029.md); [Ch1
6:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044).md), the master of the music
together with Asaph and Heman, and the chief of the six classes of
musicians over whom his six sons were placed as sub-directors (1 Chr.
25).

The collector has placed the Psalms of the two Ezrahites together.
Without this relationship of the authors the juxtaposition would also be
justified by the reciprocal relation in which the two Psalms stand to
one another by their common, striking coincidences with the Book of Job.
As to the rest, however, Ps 88 is a purely individual, and Psalms 89 a
thoroughly nationally Psalm. Both the poetical character and the
situation of the two Psalms are distinct.

The circumstances in which the writer of Psalms 89 finds himself are in
most striking contradiction to the promises given to the house of David.
He revels in the contents of these promises, and in the majesty and
faithfulness of God, and then he pours forth his intense feeling of the
great distance between these and the present circumstances in complaints
over the afflicted lot of the anointed of God, and prays God to be
mindful of His promises, and on the other hand, of the reproach by which
at this time His anointed and His people are overwhelmed. The anointed
one is not the nation itself (Hitzig), but he who at that time wears the
crown. The crown of the king is defiled to the ground; his throne is
cast down to the earth; he is become grey-headed before his time, for
all the fences of his land are broken through, his fortresses fallen,
and his enemies have driven him out of the field, so that reproach and
scorn follow him at every step.

There was no occasion for such complaints in the reign of Solomon; but
surely in the time of Rehoboam, into the first decade of whose reign
Ethan the Ezrahite may have survived king Solomon, who died at the age
of sixty. In the fifth year of Rehoboam, Shishak (שׁישׁק = Σέσογχις =
Shishonk I), the first Pharaoh of the twenty-second (Bubastic) dynasty,
marched against Jerusalem with a large army gathered together out of
many nations, conquered the fortified cities of Judah, and spoiled the
Temple and Palace, even carrying away with him the golden shields of
Solomon - a circumstance which the history bewails in a very especial
manner. At that time Shemaiah preached repentance, in the time of the
greatest calamity of war; king and princes humbled themselves; and in
the midst of judgment Jerusalem accordingly experienced the gracious
forbearance of God, and was spared. God did not complete his
destruction, and there also again went forth דברים טובים, i.e., (cf.
[Jos 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#014.md); [Zac
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013).md) kindly comforting words from
God, in Judah. Such is the narrative in the Book of Kings ([Kg1
14:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025).md) and as supplemented by the
chronicler ([Ch2 12:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001).md).

During this very period Psalms 89 took its rise. The young Davidic king,
whom loss and disgrace make prematurely old, is Rehoboam, that man of
Jewish appearance whom Pharaoh Sheshonk is bringing among other captives
before the god Amun in the monumental picture of Karnak, and who bears
before him in his embattled ring the words Judhmelek (King of Judah) -
one of the finest and most reliable discoveries of Champollion, and one
of the greatest triumphs of his system of hieroglyphics.

(Note: Vid., Blau, Sisags Zug gegen Juda, illustrated from the monument
in Karnak, Deutsche Morgenlnd. Zeitschr. xv. 233-250.)

Ps. 89 stands in kindred relationship not only to Ps 74, but besides
[Psa 79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md), also to Ps 77-78, all of
which glance back to the earliest times in the history of Israel. They
are all Asaphic Psalms, partly old Asaphic (Ps 77, Ps 78), partly later
ones (Ps 74, [Psa 79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001).md). From this
fact we see that the Psalms of Asaph were the favourite models in that
school of the four wise men to which the two Ezrahites belong.

[Psalms 89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 89:1</span></span>

The poet, who, as one soon observes, is a חכם (for the very beginning of
the Psalm is remarkable and ingenious), begins with the confession of
the inviolability of the mercies promised to the house of David, i.e.,
of the הסדי דוד הנּאמנים, [Isa 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md).

(Note: The Vulgate renders: Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo.
The second Sunday after Easter takes its name from this rendering.)

God's faithful love towards the house of David, a love faithful to His
promises, will he sing without ceasing, and make it known with his
mouth, i.e., audibly and publicly (cf. [Job
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#016).md), to the distant posterity.
Instead of חסדי, we find here, and also in [Lam
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#022.md), חסדי with a not merely slightly
closed syllable. The Lamed of לדר ודר is, according to [Psa
103:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#007.md); [Psa
145:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#012.md), the datival Lamed. With
כּי־אמרתּי (lxx, Jerome, contrary to [Psa
89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003), ὅτι εἶπας.md) the poet bases his
resolve upon his conviction. נבנה means not so much to be upheld in
building, as to be in the course of continuous building (e.g., [Job
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#023.md); [Mal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015.md), of an increasingly prosperous
condition). Loving-kindness is for ever (accusative of duration) in the
course of continuous building, viz., upon the unshakeable foundation of
the promise of grace, inasmuch as it is fulfilled in accordance
therewith. It is a building with a most solid foundation, which will not
only not fall into ruins, but, adding one stone of fulfilment upon
another, will rise ever higher and higher. שׁמים then stands first as
casus absol., and בּהם is, as in [Psa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005.md), a pronoun having a backward
reference to it. In the heavens, which are exalted above the rise and
fall of things here below, God establishes His faithfulness, so that it
stands fast as the sun above the earth, although the condition of things
here below seems sometimes to contradict it (cf. [Psa
119:89](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089).md). Now follow in [Psa
89:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004.md) the direct words of God, the
sum of the promises given to David and to his seed in 2 Sam. 7, at which
the poet arrives more naturally in [Psa
89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020.md). Here they are strikingly devoid
of connection. It is the special substance of the promises that is
associated in thought with the "loving-kindness" and "truth" of [Psa
89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003.md), which is expanded as it were
appositionally therein. Hence also אכין and תּכין, וּבניתי and יבּנה
correspond to one another. David's seed, by virtue of divine
faithfulness, has an eternally sure existence; Jahve builds up David's
throne "into generation and generation," inasmuch as He causes it to
rise ever fresh and vigorous, never as that which is growing old and
feeble.

[Psalms 89:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 89:5</span></span>

At the close of the promises in [Psa
89:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004.md) the music is to become forte.
And ויודוּ attaches itself to this jubilant Sela. In [Psa
89:6-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006.md) there follows a hymnic
description of the exalted majesty of God, more especially of His
omnipotence and faithfulness, because the value of the promise is
measured by the character of the person who promises. The God of the
promise is He who is praised by the heavens and the holy ones above. His
way of acting is פלא, of a transcendent, paradoxical, wondrous order,
and as such the heavens praise it; it is praised (יודו, according to
Ges. 137, 3) in the assembly of the holy ones, i.e., of the spirits in
the other world, the angels (as in [Job
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001.md); [Job
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015.md), cf. [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002).md), for He is peerlessly exalted
above the heavens and the angels. שׁחק, poetic singular instead of
שׁחקים (vid., supra on [Psa 77:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#018).md),
which is in itself already poetical; and ערך, not, as e.g., in [Isa
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018.md), in the signification to
co-ordinate, but in the medial sense: to rank with, be equal to.
Concerning בּני אלים, vid., on [Psa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md). In the great council (concerning
סוד, of both genders, perhaps like כּוס, vid., on [Psa
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014).md) of the holy ones also, Jahve is
terrible; He towers above all who are about Him ([Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019.md), cf. [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010).md) in terrible majesty. רבּה might,
according to [Psa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003.md); [Psa
78:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#015.md), be an adverb, but according to
the order of the words it may more appropriately be regarded as an
adjective; cf. [Job 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#034.md), כּי אערץ
המון רבּה, "when I feared the great multitude." In [Psa
89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009.md) He is apostrophized with אלהי
צבאות as being the One exalted above the heavens and the angels. The
question "Who is as Thou?" takes its origin from [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md). חסין is not the construct form,
but the principal form, like גּביר, ידיד, עויל ,יד, and is a Syriasm;
for the verbal stem Syr. hṣan is native to the Aramaic, in which Syr.
haṣı̄nā' = שׁדּי. In יהּ, what God is is reduced to the briefest possible
expression (vid., [Psa 68:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#019).md). In the
words, "Thy faithfulness compasseth Thee round about," the primary
thought of the poet again breaks through. Such a God it is who has the
faithfulness with which He fulfils all His promises, and the promises
given to the house of David also, as His constant surrounding. His glory
would only strike one with terror; but the faithfulness which
encompasses Him softens the sunlike brilliancy of His glory, and awakens
trust in so majestic a Ruler.

[Psalms 89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 89:9</span></span>

At the time of the poet the nation of the house of David was threatened
with assault from violent foes; and this fact gives occasion for this
picture of God's power in the kingdom of nature. He who rules the raging
of the sea, also rules the raging of the sea of the peoples, [Psa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008.md). גּאוּת, a proud rising, here of
the sea, like גּאוה in [Psa 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md).
Instead of בּשׂוע, Hitzig pleasantly enough reads בּשׁוא = בּשׁאו from
שׁאה; but שׂוא is also possible so far as language is concerned, either
as an infinitive = נשׂוא, [Psa 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md);
[Isa 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014) (instead of שׂאת.md), or as an
infinitival noun, like שׂיא, loftiness, [Job
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#006.md), with a likewise rejected Nun.
The formation of the clause favours our taking it as a verb: when its
waves rise, Thou stillest them. From the natural sea the poet comes to
the sea of the peoples; and in the doings of God at the Red Sea a
miraculous subjugation of both seas took place at one and the same time.
It is clear from [Psa 74:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013.md); [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md), that Egypt is to be understood
by Rahab in this passage as in [Psa
87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md). The word signifies first of all
impetuosity, violence, then a monster, like "the wild beast of the
reed," [Psa 68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031.md), i.e., the leviathan
or the dragon. דּכּאת is conjugated after the manner of the Lamed He
verbs, as in [Psa 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020.md). כּחלל is to
be understood as describing the event or issue (vid., [Psa
18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043).md): so that in its fall the
proudly defiant kingdom is like one fatally smitten. Thereupon in [Psa
89:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#012.md) again follows in the same
co-ordination first the praise of God drawn from nature, then from
history. Jahve's are the heavens and the earth. He is the Creator, and
for that very reason the absolute owner, of both. The north and the
right hand, i.e., the south, represent the earth in its entire compass
from one region of the heavens to the other. Tabor on this side of the
Jordan represents the west (cf. [Hos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001).md), and Hermon opposite the east of
the Holy Land. Both exult by reason of the name of God; by their fresh,
cheerful look they give the impression of joy at the glorious revelation
of the divine creative might manifest in themselves. In [Psa
89:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#014.md) the praise again enters upon the
province of history. "An arm with (עם) heroic strength," says the poet,
inasmuch as he distinguishes between the attribute inherent in God and
the medium of its manifestation in history. His throne has as its מכון,
i.e., its immovable foundation ([Pro
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#012.md); [Pro
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#005).md), righteousness of action and
right, by which all action is regulated, and which is unceasingly
realized by means of the action. And mercy and truth wait upon Him. קדּם
פּני is not; to go before any one (הלּך לפני, Ps 85:14), but
anticipatingly to present one's self to any one, [Psa
88:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#014.md); [Psa
95:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#002.md); [Mic
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md). Mercy and truth, these two genii
of sacred history ([Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003).md), stand
before His face like waiting servants watching upon His nod.

[Psalms 89:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 89:15</span></span>

The poet has now described what kind of God He is upon whose promise the
royal house in Israel depends. Blessed, then, is the people that walks
in the light of His countenance. הלּך of a self-assured, stately walk.
The words ידעי תּרוּעה are the statement of the ground of the blessing
interwoven into the blessing itself: such a people has abundant cause
and matter for exultation (cf. [Psa
84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005).md). תּרוּעה is the festive sound of
joy of the mouth ([Num 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021).md), and of
trumpets or sackbuts ([Psa 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006).md). This
confirmation of the blessing is expanded in [Psa
89:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#017.md). Jahve's שׁם, i.e.,
revelation or manifestation, becomes to them a ground and object of
unceasing joy; by His צדקה, i.e., the rigour with which He binds Himself
to the relationship He has entered upon with His people and maintains
it, they are exalted above abjectness and insecurity. He is תּפארת
עזּמו, the ornament of their strength, i.e., their strength which really
becomes an ornament to them. In [Psa
89:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#018.md) the poet declares Israel to be
this happy people. Pinsker's conjecture, קרנם (following the Targum),
destroys the transition to [Psa 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md),
which is formed by [Psa 89:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#018.md). The
plural reading of Kimchi and of older editions (e.g., Bomberg's),
קרנינוּ, is incompatible with the figure; but it is immaterial whether
we read תּרים with the Chethb (Targum, Jerome), or with the Ker (lxx,
Syriac) תּרוּם.

(Note: Zur Geschichte des Karaismus, pp. קפא and קפב, according to
which, reversely, in [Jos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md) עברוּ is
to be read instead of עברם, and [Isa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002.md) זרענוּ instead of זרעם, [Psa
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#008.md) תשמרנּוּ instead of תשמרם, [Mic
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#019.md) חטאתנוּ instead of חטאתם, [Job
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md) תביננּוּ instead of תבינם, [Pro
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#027.md) כבודנוּ instead of כבודם (the
limiting of our honour brings honour, - an unlikely interpretation of
the חקר).)

מגנּנוּ and מלכּנוּ in [Psa 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md) are
parallel designations of the human king of Israel; מגן as in Ps 47:10,
but not in [Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md). For we are not
compelled, with a total disregard of the limits to the possibilities of
style (Ew. 310, a), to render [Psa
89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md): and the Holy One of Israel, (as
to Him, He) is our King (Hitzig), since we do not bring down the Psalm
beyond the time of the kings. Israel's shield, Israel's king, the poet
says in the holy defiant confidence of faith, is Jahve's, belongs to the
Holy One of Israel, i.e., he stands as His own possession under the
protection of Jahve, the Holy One, who has taken Israel to Himself for a
possession; it is therefore impossible that the Davidic throne should
become a prey to any worldly power.

[Psalms 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 89:19</span></span>

Having thus again come to refer to the king of Israel, the poet now
still further unfolds the promise given to the house of David. The
present circumstances are a contradiction to it. The prayer to Jahve,
for which the way is thus prepared, is for the removal of this
contradiction. A long line, extending beyond the measure of the
preceding lines, introduces the promises given to David. With אז the
respective period of the past is distinctly defined. The intimate friend
of Jahve (חסיד) is Nathan ([Ch1 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#015).md)
or David, according as we translate בחזון "in a vision" or "by means of
a vision." But side by side with the לחסידך we also find the preferable
reading לחסידיך, which is followed in the renderings of the lxx, Syriac,
Vulgate, Targum, Aquila, Symmachus, and the Quarta, and is adopted by
Rashi, Aben-Ezra, and others, and taken up by Heidenheim and Baer. The
plural refers to Samuel and Nathan, for the statement brings together
what was revealed to these two prophets concerning David. עזר is
assistance as a gift, and that, as the designation of the person
succoured by it (שׁוּה על as in [Psa
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006).md) with גּבּור shows, aid in
battle. בּחוּר (from בּחר = בּגר in the Mishna: to ripen, to be manly or
of marriageable age, distinct from בּחיר in [Psa
89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004).md) is a young man, adolescens:
while yet a young man David was raised out of his humble lowly condition
([Psa 78:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#071).md) high above the people.
When he received the promise (2 Sam. 7) he had been anointed and had
attained to the lordship over all Israel. Hence the preterites in [Psa
89:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020.md), which are followed by
promissory futures from [Psa 89:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#022.md)
onwards. תּכּון is fut. Niph., to be established, to prove one's self to
be firm, unchangeable ([Psa 78:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#037).md), a
stronger expression than תּהיה, [Sa1
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#012.md), [Sa1
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#014.md); [Sa2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#010.md). The Hiph. השּׁיא, derived from
נשׁא = נשׁה, to credit (vid., on [Isa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002); Gesenius, Hengstenberg.md), does
not give any suitable sense; it therefore signifies here as elsewhere,
"to impose upon, surprise," with בּ, as in [Psa
55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016.md) with על. [Psa
89:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#023.md) is the echo of [Sa2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 89:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 89:23</span></span>

What is promised in [Psa 89:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#026.md) is a
world-wide dominion, not merely dominion within the compass promised in
the primeval times ([Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); [Ch2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#026).md), in which case it ought to have
been said ובנהר (of the Euphrates). Nor does the promise, however, sound
so definite and boundless here as in [Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md), but it is indefinite and
universal, without any need for our asking what rivers are intended by
נהרות. נתן יד בּ, like שׁלח (in [Isa
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014.md), of a giving and taking
possession. With אף־אני (with retreated tone, as in [Psa
119:63](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#063.md), [Psa
119:125](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#125).md) God tells with what He will
answer David's filial love. Him who is the latest-born among the sons of
Jesse, God makes the first-born (בּכור from בּכר, to be early, opp.
לקשׁ, to be late, vid., [Job 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md)
:21), and therefore the most favoured of the "sons of the Most High,"
[Psa 82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md). And as, according to [Deu
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001), Israel is to be high (עליון.md)
above all nations of the earth, so David, Israel's king, in whom
Israel's national glory realizes itself, is made as the high one (עליון)
with respect to the kings, i.e., above the kings, of the earth. In the
person of David his seed is included; and it is that position of honour
which, after having been only prelusively realized in David and Solomon,
must go on being fulfilled in his seed exactly as the promise runs. The
covenant with David is, according to [Psa
89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md), one that shall stand for ever.
David is therefore, as [Psa 89:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030.md)
affirms, eternal in his seed; God will make David's seed and throne לעד,
into eternal, i.e., into such as will abide for ever, like the days of
heaven, everlasting. This description of eternal duration is, as also in
Sir. 45:15, Bar. 1:11, Taken from [Deu
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#021.md); the whole of [Psa
89:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030.md) is a poetic reproduction of [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 89:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 89:30</span></span>

Now follows the paraphrase of [Sa2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md), that the faithlessness of
David's line in relation to the covenant shall not interfere with
(annul) the faithfulness of God - a thought with which one might very
naturally console one's self in the reign of Rehoboam. Because God has
placed the house of David in a filial relationship to Himself, He will
chastise the apostate members as a father chastises his son; cf. [Pro
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#013.md). In [Ch1
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#013.md) the chronicler omits the words
of [Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md) which there provide
against perverted action (העוות) on the part of the seed of David; our
Psalm proves their originality. But even if, as history shows, this
means of chastisement should be ineffectual in the case of individuals,
the house of David as such will nevertheless remain ever in a state of
favour with Him. In [Psa 89:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034.md) חסדּי
לא־אפיר מעמּו corresponds to וחסדּי־לא־יסוּר ממּנּוּ in [Sa2
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#015) (lxx, Targum.md): the fut. Hiph. of
פרר is otherwise always אפר; the conjecture אסיר is therefore natural,
yet even the lxx translators (ου ̓ μὴ διασκεδάσω) had אפיר before them.
שׁקּר בּ as in [Psa 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018.md). The
covenant with David is sacred with God: He will not profane it (חלּל, to
loose the bonds of sanctity). He will fulfil what has gone forth from
His lips, i.e., His vow, according to [Deu
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024.md) \[23\], cf. [Num
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003.md) \[2\]. One thing hath He sworn to
David; not: once = once for all (lxx), for what is introduced by [Psa
89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036.md) (cf. [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004).md) and follows in [Psa
89:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037.md), [Psa
89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md), is in reality one thing (as in
[Psa 62:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#012), two.md). He hath sworn it per
sanctitatem suam. Thus, and not in sanctuario meo, בּקדשׁי in this
passage and [Amo 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002.md) (cf. on [Psa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008).md) is to be rendered, for elsewhere
the expression is בּי, [Gen 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md);
[Isa 45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md), or בּנפשׁו, [Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008.md); [Jer
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#014.md), or בּשׁמי, [Jer
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#026.md), or בּימינו, [Isa
62:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008.md). It is true we do not read any
set form of oath in 2 Sam. 7, 1 Chr. 17, but just as Isaiah, [Isa
54:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009.md), takes the divine promise in [Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md) as an oath, so the promise so
earnestly and most solemnly pledged to David may be accounted by
Psalm-poesy (here and in [Psa 132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011).md),
which reproduces the historical matter of fact, as a promise attested
with an oath. With אם in [Psa 89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036.md)
God asserts that He will not disappoint David in reference to this one
thing, viz., the perpetuity of his throne. This shall stand for ever as
the sun and moon; for these, though they may one day undergo a change
([Psa 102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027).md), shall nevertheless
never be destroyed. In the presence of [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md) it looks as if [Psa
89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md) ought to be rendered: and as the
witness in the clouds shall it (David's throne) be faithful (perpetual).
By the witness in the clouds one would then have to understand the
rainbow as the celestial memorial and sign of an everlasting covenant.
Thus Luther, Geier, Schmid, and others. But neither this rendering, nor
the more natural one, "and as the perpetual, faithful witness in the
clouds," is admissible in connection with the absence of the כּ of
comparison. Accordingly Hengstenberg, following the example of Jewish
expositors, renders: "and the witness in the clouds is perpetual," viz.,
the moon, so that the continuance of the Davidic line would be
associated with the moon, just as the continuance of the condemned earth
is with the rainbow. But in what sense would the moon have the name,
without example elsewhere, of witness? Just as the Book of Job was the
key to the conclusion of Ps 88, so it is the key to this ambiguous verse
of the Psalm before us. It has to be explained according to [Job
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#019.md), where Job says: "Behold in
heaven is my witness, and my surety in the heights." Jahve, the אל נאמן
([Deu 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009).md), seals His sworn promise
with the words, "and the witness in the sky (ethereal heights) is
faithful" (cf. concerning this Waw in connection with asseverations, Ew.
340, c). Hengstenberg's objection, that Jahve cannot be called His own
witness, is disposed of by the fact that עד frequently signifies the
person who testifies anything concerning himself; in this sense, in
fact, the whole Tra is called עדוּת ה (the testimony of Jahve).

[Psalms 89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 89:38</span></span>

Now after the poet has turned his thoughts towards the beginnings of the
house of David which were so rich in promise, in order that he might
find comfort under the sorrowful present, the contrast of the two
periods is become all the more sensible to him. With ואתּה in [Psa
89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md) (And Thou - the same who hast
promised and affirmed this with an oath) his Psalm takes a new turn, for
which reason it might even have been ועתּה. זנח is used just as
absolutely here as in [Psa 44:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#024.md); [Psa
74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md); [Psa
77:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#008.md), so that it does not require any
object to be supplied out of [Psa
89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md). נארתּה in [Psa
89:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#040.md) the lxx renders kate'strepsas;
it is better rendered in [Lam 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md)
ἀπετίναξε; for נאר is synonymous with נער, to shake off, push away, cf.
Arabic el-menâ‛ir, the thrusters (with the lance). עבדּך is a vocational
name of the king as such. His crown is sacred as being the insignia of a
God-bestowed office. God has therefore made the sacred thing vile by
casting it to the ground (חלּל לארץ, as in [Psa
74:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#017.md), to cast profaningly to the
ground). The primary passage to [Psa
89:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#041.md), is [Psa
80:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#013.md). "His hedges" are all the
boundary and protecting fences which the land of the king has; and
מבצריו "the fortresses" of his land (in both instances without כל,
because matters have not yet come to such a pass).

(Note: In the list of the nations and cities conquered by King Sheshonk
I are found even cities of the tribe of Issachar, e.g., Shen-ma-an,
Sunem; vid., Brugsch, Reiseberichte, S. 141-145, and Blau as referred to
above.)

In שׁסּהוּ the notions of the king and of the land blend together.
עברי־דרך are the hordes of the peoples passing through the land. שׁכניו
are the neighbouring peoples that are otherwise liable to pay tribute to
the house of David, who sought to take every possible advantage of that
weakening of the Davidic kingdom. In [Psa
89:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#044.md) we are neither to translate
"rock of his sword" (Hengstenberg), nor "O rock" (Olshausen). צוּר does
not merely signify rupes, but also from another root (צוּר, Arab. ṣâr,
originally of the grating or shrill noise produced by pressing and
squeezing, then more particularly to cut or cut off with pressure, with
a sharply set knife or the like) a knife or a blade (cf. English knife,
and German kneifen, to nip): God has decreed it that the edge or blade
of the sword of the king has been turned back by the enemy, that he has
not been able to maintain his ground in battle (הקמתו with ē instead of
ı̂, as also when the tone is not moved forward, [Mic
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004).md). In [Psa
89:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#045.md) the Mem of מטהרו, after the
analogy of [Eze 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#041.md); [Eze
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#010.md), and other passages, is a
preposition: cessare fecisti eum a splendore suo. A noun מטּהר = מטהר
with Dag. dirimens,

(Note: The view of Pinsker (Einleitung, S. 69), that this Dag. is not a
sign of the doubling of the letter, but a diacritic point (that preceded
the invention of the system of vowel-points), which indicated that the
respective letter was to be pronounced with a Chateph vowel (e.g.,
miṭŏhar), is incorrect. The doubling Dag. renders the Sheb audible, and
having once become audible it readily receives this or that colouring
according to the nature of its consonant and of the neighbouring vowel.)

like מקדּשׁ [Exo 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017.md), מנּזר [Nah
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017.md) (Abulwald, Aben-Ezra, Parchon,
Kimchi, and others), in itself improbable in the signification required
here, is not found either in post-biblical or in biblical Hebrew. טהר,
like צהר, signifies first of all not purity, but brilliancy. Still the
form טהר does not lie at the basis of it in this instance; for the
reading found here just happens not to be טהרו, but מטּהרו; and the
reading adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer, as also by Nissel and
others, so far as form is concerned is not distinct from it, viz.,
מטּהרו (miṭtŏharo), the character of the Sheb being determined by the
analogy of the following (cf. בּסּערה, [Kg2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001).md), which presupposes the principal
form טהר (Bttcher, 386, cf. supra, 2:31, note). The personal tenor of
[Psa 89:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#046.md) requires that it should be
referred to the then reigning Davidic king, but not as dying before his
time (Olshausen), but as becoming prematurely old by reason of the
sorrowful experiences of his reign. The larger half of the kingdom has
been wrested from him; Egypt and the neighbouring nations also threaten
the half that remains to him; and instead of the kingly robe, shame
completely covers him.

[Psalms 89:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">psa 89:46</span></span>

After this statement of the present condition of things the psalmist
begins to pray for the removal of all that is thus contradictory to the
promise. The plaintive question, [Psa
89:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047.md), with the exception of one word,
is verbatim the same as [Psa 79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005.md). The
wrath to which quousque refers, makes itself to be felt, as the
intensifying (vid., [Psa 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002).md) לנצח
implies, in the intensity and duration of everlasting wrath. חלד is this
temporal life which glides past secretly and unnoticed ([Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014).md); and זכר־אני is not equivalent
to זכרני (instead of which by way of emphasis only זכרני אני can be
said), but אני מה־חלד stands for מה־חלד אני - according to the sense
equivalent to אני מה־חדל, [Psa 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005.md),
cf. [Psa 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006.md). The conjecture of
Houbigant and modern expositors, זכר אדני (cf. [Psa
89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051).md), is not needed, since the
inverted position of the words is just the same as in [Psa
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005.md). In [Psa
89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048.md) it is not pointed על־מה שׁוא,
"wherefore ([Job 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#002.md); [Job
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014).md) hast Thou in vain ([Psa
127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001)) created?" (Hengstenberg.md), but
על־מה־שּׁוא, on account of or for what a nothing (מה־שׁוא belonging
together as adjective and substantive, as in [Psa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#010.md); [Job
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014).md) hast Thou created all the
children of men? (De Wette, Hupfeld, and Hitzig). על, of the ground of a
matter and direct motive, which is better suited to the question in [Psa
89:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#049.md) than the other way of taking it:
the life of all men passes on into death and Hades; why then might not
God, within this brief space of time, this handbreadth, manifest Himself
to His creatures as the merciful and kind, and not as the always angry
God? The music strikes in here, and how can it do so otherwise than in
elegiac mesto? If God's justice tarries and fails in this present world,
then the Old Testament faith becomes sorely tempted and tried, because
it is not able to find consolation in the life beyond. Thus it is with
the faith of the poet in the present juncture of affairs, the outward
appearance of which is in such perplexing contradiction to the
loving-kindness sworn to David and also hitherto vouchsafed. חסדים has
not the sense in this passage of the promises of favour, as in [Ch2
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042.md), but proofs of favour; הראשׁנים
glances back at the long period of the reigns of David and of Solomon.

(Note: The Pasek between חראשׁנים and אדני is not designed merely to
remove the limited predicate from the Lord, who is indeed the First and
the Last, but also to secure its pronunciation to the guttural Aleph,
which might be easily passed over after Mem; cf. [Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027.md); [Gen
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#017.md); [Gen
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#020.md); [Gen
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021), and frequently..md)

The Asaph Ps 77 and the Tephilla Isa. 63 contain similar complaints,
just as in connection with [Psa 89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051.md)
one is reminded of the Asaph [Psa
79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002.md), [Psa
79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010.md), and in connection with [Psa
89:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#052.md) of [Psa
79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012.md). The phrase נשׂא בחיקו is used
in other instances of loving nurture, [Num
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012.md); [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md). In this passage it must have a
sense akin to חרפּת עבדיך. It is impossible on syntactic grounds to
regard כּל־רבּים עמּים as still dependent upon חרפּת (Ewald) or, as
Hupfeld is fond of calling it, as a "post-liminiar" genitive. Can it be
that the כל is perhaps a mutilation of כּלמּת, after [Eze
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#015.md), as Bttcher suggests? We do not
need this conjecture. For (1) to carry any one in one's bosom, if he is
an enemy, may signify: to be obliged to cherish him with the vexation
proceeding from him ([Jer 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015).md),
without being able to get rid of him; (2) there is no doubt that רבּים
can, after the manner of numerals, be placed before the substantive to
which it belongs, [Eze 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#010.md), [Pro
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#029.md); [Ch1
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#005.md); [Neh
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#028.md); cf. the other position, e.g.,
[Jer 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016); (3.md) consequently כּל־רבּים
עמּים may signify the "totality of many peoples" just as well as כּל
גּוים רבּים in [Eze 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#006.md). The poet
complains as a member of the nation, as a citizen of the empire, that he
is obliged to foster many nations in his bosom, inasmuch as the land of
Israel was overwhelmed by the Egyptians and their allies, the Libyans,
Troglodytes, and Ethiopians. The אשׁר which follows in [Psa
89:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#052.md) cannot now be referred back over
[Psa 89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051) to חרפּת (quâ calumniâ.md),
and yet the relative sense, not the confirmatory (because, quoniam), is
at issue. We therefore refer it to עמים, and take אויביך as an
apposition, as in [Psa 139:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020.md) : who
reproach Thee, (as) Thine enemies, Jahve, who reproach the footsteps
(עקּבות as in [Psa 77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020.md) with Dag.
dirimens, which gives it an emotional turn) of Thine anointed, i.e.,
they follow him everywhere, wheresoever he may go, and whatsoever he may
do. With these significant words, עקּבות משׁיחך, the Third Book of the
Psalms dies away.
