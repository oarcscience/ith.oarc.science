Nahum

Introduction

Person of the Prophet. - All that we know of Nahum (Nachūm, i.e.,
consolation or comforter, consolator, Gr. Ναούμ) is, that he sprang from
the place called Elkosh; since the epithet hâ'elqōshı̄, in the heading to
his book, is not a patronymic, but the place of his birth. Elkosh is not
to be sought for in Assyria, however, viz., in the Christian village of
Alkush, which is situated on the eastern side of the Tigris, to the
north-west of Khorsabad, two days' journey from Mosul, where the tomb of
the prophet Nahum is shown in the form of a simple plaster box of modern
style, and which is held in great reverence, as a holy place, by the
Christians and Mohammedans of that neighbourhood (see Layard, Nineveh
and its Remains, i. 233), as Michaelis, Eichhorn, Ewald, and others
suppose. For this village, with its pretended tomb of the prophet, has
not the smallest trace of antiquity about it, and is mentioned for the
first time by a monk of the sixteenth century, in a letter to Assemani
(Biblioth. or. i. 525, iii. 1, p. 352). Now, as a tomb of the prophet
Jonah is also shown in the neighbourhood of Nineveh, the assumption is a
very natural one, that the name Elkush did not come from the village
into the book, but passed from the book to the village (Hitzig). The
statement of Jerome is older, and much more credible, - namely, that
"Elkosh was situated in Galilee, since there is to the present day a
village in Galilee called Helcesaei (others Helcesei, Elcesi), a very
small one indeed, and containing in its ruins hardly any traces of
ancient buildings, but one which is well known to the Jews, and was also
pointed out to me by my guide," - inasmuch as he does not simply base
his statement upon the word of his guide, but describes the place as
well known to the Jews. This Jewish tradition of the birth of Nahum in
the Galilaean Elkosh, or Ἐλκεσέ, is also supported by Cyril of Alex.,
Ps. Epiphanius, and Ps. Dorotheus, although the more precise accounts of
the situation of the place are confused and erroneous in the two last
named. We have indeed no further evidence that Nahum sprang out of
Galilee. The name of the Elkesaites furnishes just as little proof of
the existence of a place called Elkosh, as the name Capernaum, i.e.,
village of Nahum, of the fact that our prophet lived there. Whether the
sect of the Elkesaites really derived their name from a founder named
Elxai or Elkesai, is just as questionable as the connection between this
Elxai and the place called Elkosh; and the conjecture that Capernaum
received its name from our prophet is altogether visionary. But Jerome's
statement is quite sufficient, since it is confirmed by the contents of
Nahum's prophecy. Ewald indeed imagines that he can see very clearly,
from the general colouring of the little book, that Nahum did not live
in Palestine, by in Assyria, and must have seen with his own eyes the
danger which threatened Nineveh, from an invasion by powerful foes, as
being one of the descendants of the Israelites who had formerly been
transported to Assyria. "It moves," he says, "for example, round about
Nineveh only, and that with a fulness such as we do not find in any
other prophecy relating to a foreign nation; and it is quite in a casual
manner that it glances at Judah in Nahum 1:13-2:3. There is not a single
trace of its having been written by Nahum in Judah; on the contrary, it
follows most decidedly, from the form given to the words in [Nah
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001.md) ([Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015).md), compared with [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md), that he was prophesying at a
great distance from Jerusalem and Judah." But why should not an earlier
prophet, who lived in the kingdom of Israel or that of Judah, have been
able to utter a special prophecy concerning Nineveh, in consequence of a
special commission from God? Moreover, it is not merely in a casual
manner that Nahum glances at Judah; on the contrary, his whole prophecy
is meant for Judah; and his glance at Judah, notwithstanding its
brevity, assumes, as Umbreit has correctly observed, a very important
and central position. And the assertion, that there is not a single
trace in the whole prophecy of Nahum's having been in Judah, has been
contested with good reason by Maurer, Hitzig, and others, who appeal to
[Nah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004.md) and 1:13-2:3, where such
traces are to be found.

On the other hand, if the book had been written by a prophet living in
exile, there would surely be some allusions to the situation and
circumstances of the exiles; whereas we look in vain for any such
allusions in Nahum. Again, the acquaintance with Assyrian affairs, to
which Ewald still further appeals, is not greater than that which might
have been possessed by any prophet, or even by any inhabitant of Judah
in the time of Hezekiah, after the repeated invasions of Israel and
Judah by the Assyrians. "The liveliness of the description runs through
the whole book. Ch. [Nah 1:2-14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002.md) is not
less lively than [Nah 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001.md); and yet
no one would infer from the former that Nahum must have seen with his
own eyes all that he sets before our eyes in so magnificent a picture in
[Nah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002)." (Ngelsbach; Herzog's Cycl..md)
It is not more a fact that "[Nah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#006.md)
contains such special acquaintance with the locality of Nineveh, as
could only be derived from actual inspection," than that "[Nah
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#007.md) contains the name of the Assyrian
queen (Huzzab)." Moreover, of the words that are peculiar to our
prophet, taphsar ([Nah 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017).md) is the
only one that is even probably Assyrian; and this is a military term,
which the Judaeans in Palestine may have heard from Assyrians living
there. The rest of the supposed Aramaeisms, such as the suffixes in
גּבּוריהוּ ([Nah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#004).md) and מלאככה ([Nah
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013).md), and the words גהג, to sigh =
הגה ([Nah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#008).md), דּהר ([Nah
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#002).md), and פּלדות ([Nah
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#004).md), may be accounted for from the
Galilaean origin of the prophet. Consequently there is no tenable ground
whatever for the assumption that Nahum lived in exile, and uttered his
prophecy in the neighbourhood of Nineveh. There is much greater reason
for inferring, from the many points of coincidence between Nahum and
Isaiah, that he was born in Galilee during the Assyrian invasions, and
that he emigrated to Judaea, where he lived and prophesied. Nothing
whatever is known of the circumstances of his life. The notices in Ps.
Epiphan. concerning his miracles and his death (see O. Strauss, Nahumi
de Nino vaticin. expl. p. xii.f.) can lay no claim to truth. Even the
period of his life is so much a matter of dispute, that some suppose him
to have prophesied under Jehu and Jehoahaz, whilst others believe that
he did not prophesy till the time of Zedekiah; at the same time it is
possible to decide this with tolerable certainty from the contents of
the book.

2\. The Book of Nahum contains one extended prophecy concerning Nineveh,
in which the ruin of that city and of the Assyrian world-power is
predicted in three strophes, answering to the division into chapters;
viz., in [Nah 1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md) the divine
purpose to inflict judgment upon this oppressor of Israel; in [Nah
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001.md) the joyful news of the
conquest, plundering, and destruction of Nineveh; and in ch. 3 its guilt
and its inevitable ruin. These are all depicted with pictorial
liveliness and perspicuity. Now, although this prophecy neither closes
with a Messianic prospect, nor enters more minutely into the
circumstances of the Israelitish kingdom of God in general, it is
rounded off within itself, and stands in such close relation to Judah,
that it may be called a prophecy of consolation for that kingdom. The
fall of the mighty capital of the Assyrian empire, that representative
of the godless and God-opposing power of the world, which sought to
destroy the Israelitish kingdom of God, was not only closely connected
with the continuance and development of the kingdom of God in Judah, but
the connection is very obvious in Nahum's prophecy. Even in the
introduction ([Nah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002)..md) the
destruction of Nineveh is announced as a judgment, which Jehovah, the
zealous God and avenger of evil, executes, and in which He proves
Himself a refuge to those who trust in Him ([Nah
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007).md). But "those who trust in Him" are
not godly Gentiles here; they are rather the citizens of His kingdom,
viz., the Judaeans, upon whom Asshur had laid the yoke of bondage, which
Jehovah would break ([Nah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#013).md), so
that Judah could keep feasts and pay its vows to Him ([Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015).md). On the destruction of Nineveh
the Lord returns to the eminence of Israel, which the Assyrians have
overthrown ([Nah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#002).md). Consequently
Nineveh is to fall, and an end is to be put to the rule and tyranny of
Asshur, that the glory of Israel may be restored.

The unity and integrity of the prophecy are not open to any well-founded
objection. It is true that Eichhorn, Ewald, and De Wette, have
questioned the genuineness of the first part of the heading (the Massâ'
of Nineveh), but without sufficient reason, as even Hitzig observes. For
there is nothing that can possibly astonish us in the fact that the
object of the prophecy is mentioned first, and then the author.
Moreover, the words משּׂא נינוה cannot possibly have been added at a
later period, because the whole of the first half of the prophecy would
be unintelligible without them; since Nineveh is not mentioned by name
till [Nah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#008.md), and yet the suffix
attached to מקומהּ in [Nah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md) refers
to Nineveh, and requires the introduction of the name of that city in
the heading. There is just as little force in the arguments with which
Hitzig seeks to prove that the allusion to the conquest of No-amon in
[Nah 3:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md) is a later addition. For
the assertion that, if an Assyrian army had penetrated to Upper Egypt
and taken that city, Nahum, when addressing Nineveh, could not have
related to the Assyrians what had emanated from themselves, without at
least intimating this, would obviously be well founded only on the
supposition that the words "Art thou better than No-amon," etc., could
be taken quite prosaically as news told to the city of Nineveh, and
loses all its force, when we see that this address is simply a practical
turn, with which Nahum describes the fate of No-amon not to the
Ninevites, but to the Judaeans, as a practical proof that even the
mightiest and most strongly fortified city could be conquered and fall,
when God had decreed its ruin. From the lively description of this
occurrence, we may also explain the change from the third person to the
second in [Nah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#009.md), at which Hitzig
still takes offence. His other arguments are so subjective and
unimportant, that they require no special refutation.

With regard to the date of the composition of our prophecy, it is
evident from the contents that it was not written before, but after, the
defeat of Sennacherib in front of Jerusalem in the reign of Hezekiah,
since that event is not only clearly assumed, but no doubt furnished the
occasion for the prophecy. Asshur had overrun Judah ([Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015).md), and had severely afflicted it
([Nah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md), [Nah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012).md), yea plundered and almost
destroyed it ([Nah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#002).md). Now, even if
neither the words in [Nah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011.md), "There
is one come out of thee, who imagined evil against Jehovah," etc., nor
those of [Nah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012.md), according to the
correct interpretation, contain any special allusion to Sennacherib and
his defeat, and if it is still less likely that [Nah
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014.md) contains an allusion to his death
or murder ([Isa 37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038).md), yet the
affliction (tsârâh) which Assyria had brought upon Judah ([Nah
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009).md), and the invasion of Judah
mentioned in [Nah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md) and [Nah
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#002.md), can only refer to Sennacherib's
expedition, since he was the only one of all the kings of Assyria who so
severely oppressed Judah as to bring it to the very verge of ruin.
Moreover, [Nah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013.md), "The voice of thy
messengers shall no more be heard," is peculiarly applicable to the
messengers whom Sennacherib sent to Hezekiah, according to [Isa
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#013.md). and [Isa
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009.md)., to compel the surrender of
Jerusalem and get Judah completely into his power. But if this is
established, it cannot have been a long time after the defeat of
Sennacherib before Jerusalem, when Nahum prophesied; not only because
that event was thoroughly adapted to furnish the occasion for such a
prophecy as the one contained in our prophet's book, and because it was
an omen of the future and final judgment upon Asshur, but still more,
because the allusions to the affliction brought upon Judah by
Sennacherib are of such a kind that it must have still continued in the
most vivid recollection of the prophet and the men of his time. We
cannot do anything else, therefore, than subscribe to the view expressed
by Vitringa, viz., that "the date of Nahum must be fixed a very short
time after Isaiah and Micah, and therefore in the reign of Hezekiah, not
only after the carrying away of the ten tribes, but also after the
overthrow of Sennacherib ([Nah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011.md),
[Nah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#013).md), from which the argument of
the prophecy is taken, and the occasion for preaching the complete
destruction of Nineveh and the kingdom of Assyria" (Typ. doctr. prophet.
p. 37). The date of the composition of our book cannot be more exactly
determined. The assumption that it was composed before the murder of
Sennacherib, in the temple of his god Nisroch ([Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038.md); [Kg2
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037).md), has no support in [Nah
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014.md). And it is equally impossible to
infer from [Nah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#013.md) and [Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md) that our prophecy was uttered in
the reign of Manasseh, and occasioned by the carrying away of the king
to Babylon ([Ch2 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011).md).

The relation which exists between this prophecy and those of Isaiah is
in the most perfect harmony with the composition of the former in the
second half of the reign of Hezekiah. The resemblances which we find
between [Nah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005.md) and [Isa
47:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002.md); [Isa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#007.md), [Isa
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md) and [Isa
51:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019.md), [Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md) and [Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md) and [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md), are of such a nature that Isaiah
could just as well have alluded to Nahum as Nahum to Isaiah. If Nahum
composed his prophecy not long after the overthrow of Sennacherib, we
must assume that the former was the case. The fact that in [Nah
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md), [Nah
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#013.md) and [Nah
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010.md) there are resemblances to [Isa
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md), [Isa
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027.md) and [Isa
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016.md), where our prophet is evidently
the borrower, furnishes no decisive proof to the contrary. For the
relation in which prophets who lived and laboured at the same time stood
to one another was one of mutual giving and receiving; so that it cannot
be immediately inferred from the fact that our prophet made use of a
prophecy of his predecessor for his own purposes, that he must have been
dependent upon him in all his kindred utterances. When, on the other
hand, Ewald and Hitzig remove our prophecy to a much later period, and
place it in the time of the later Median wars with Assyria, either the
time of Phraortes (Herod. i. 102), or that of Cyaxares and his first
siege of Nineveh (Herod. i. 103), they found this opinion upon the
unscriptural assumption that it was nothing more than a production of
human sagacity and political conjecture, which could only have been
uttered "when a threatening expedition against Nineveh was already in
full operation" (Ewald), and when the danger which threatened Nineveh
was before his eyes-a view which has its roots in the denial of the
supernatural character of the prophecy, and is altogether destitute of
any solid foundation.

The style of our prophet is not inferior to the classical style of
Isaiah and Micah, either in power and originality of thought, or in
clearness and purity of form; so that, as R. Lowth (De sacr. posi Hebr.
281) has aptly observed, ex omnibus minoribus prophetis nemo videtur
aequare sublimitatem, ardorem et audaces spiritus Nahumi; whereas Ewald,
according to his preconceived opinion as to the prophet's age, "no
longer finds in this prophet, who already formed one of the later
prophets, so much inward strength, or purity and fulness of thought."

Einleitung, 299, 300.
