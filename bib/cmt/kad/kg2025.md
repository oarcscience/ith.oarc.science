### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 25:1</span></span>

Siege and conquest of Jerusalem; Zedekiah taken prisoner and led away to
Babel (cf. [Jer 52:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004) and [Jer
39:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)). - [Kg2
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001). In the ninth year of the reign
of Zedekiah, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar marched
with all his forces against Jerusalem and commenced the siege (cf. [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)), after he had taken all the rest
of the fortified cities of the land, with the exception of Lachish and
Azekah, which were besieged at the same time as Jerusalem ([Jer
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007)). On the very same day the
commencement of the siege of Jerusalem was revealed to the prophet
Ezekiel in his exile ([Eze 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001)). "And
they built against it (the city) siege-towers round about." דּיק, which
only occurs here and in Jeremiah ([Jer
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004)) and Ezekiel ([Eze
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002); [Eze
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017); [Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027); [Eze
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#008)), does not mean either a line of
circumvallation (J. D. Mich., Hitzig), or the outermost enclosure
constructed of palisades (Thenius, whose assertion that דּיק is always
mentioned as the first work of the besiegers is refuted by [Eze
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017) and [Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027)), but a watch, and that in a
collective sense: watch-towers or siege-towers (cf. Ges. thes. p. 330,
and Hvernick on [Eze 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002)).

[Kg2 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#002)

"And the city was besieged till the eleventh year of king Zedekiah," in
which the northern wall of the city was broken through on the ninth day
of the fourth month ([Kg2 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#003)). That
Jerusalem could sustain a siege of this duration, namely eighteen
months, shows what the strength of the fortifications must have been.
Moreover the siege was interrupted for a short time, when the approach
of the Egyptian king Hophra compelled the Chaldaeans to march to meet
him and drive him back, which they appear to have succeeded in doing
without a battle (cf. [Jer 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005)., [Eze
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#007)).

[Kg2 25:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#003)

Trusting partly to the help of the Egyptians and partly to the strength
of Jerusalem, Zedekiah paid no attention to the repeated entreaties of
Jeremiah, that he would save himself with his capital and people from
the destruction which was otherwise inevitable, by submitting, to the
Chaldaeans (cf. [Jer 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017), [Jer
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#018)), but allowed things to reach
their worst, until the famine became so intense, that inhuman horrors
were perpetrated (cf. [Lam 2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020);
[Lam 4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009)), and eventually a breach
was made in the city wall on the ninth day of the fourth month. The
statement of the month is omitted in our text, where the words הרביעי
בּחרשׁ ([Jer 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006), cf. [Jer
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002)) have fallen out before בּתשׁעה
([Kg2 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#003), commencement) through the
oversight of a copyist. The overwhelming extent of the famine is
mentioned, not "because the people were thereby rendered quite unfit to
offer any further resistance" (Seb. Schm.), but as a proof of the truth
of the prophetic announcements ([Lev
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029); [Deu
28:53-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053); [Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002); [Jer
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013); [Eze
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016)). הארץ עם are the common
people in Jerusalem, or the citizens of the capital. From the more
minute account of the entrance of the enemy into the city in [Jer
39:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003) we learn that the Chaldaeans
made a breach in the northern or outer wall of the lower city, i.e., the
second wall, built by Hezekiah and Manasseh ([Ch2
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005); [Ch2
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014)), and forced their way into the
lower city (המּשׁנה, [Kg2 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014)), so
that their generals took their stand at the gate of the centre, which
was in the wall that separated the lower city from the upper city upon
Zion, and formed the passage from the one to the other. When Zedekiah
saw them here, he fled by night with the soldiers out of the city,
through the gate between the two walls at or above the king's garden, on
the road to the plain of the Jordan, while the Chaldaeans were round
about the city. In [Kg2 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004) a faulty
text has come down to us. In the clause המּלחמה וכל־אנשׁי the verb
יברחוּ is omitted, if not even more, namely העיר מן ויּצאוּ יברחוּ,
"fled and went out of the city." And if we compare [Jer
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004), it is evident that before הם
וכל־אנשׁיstill more has dropped out, not merely המּלך, which must have
stood in the text, since according to [Kg2
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#005) the king was among the fugitives;
but most probably the whole clause יהוּדה מלך צדקיּהוּ ראם כּאשׁר ויהי,
since the words הם וכל־אנשׁי have no real connection with what precedes,
and cannot form a circumstantial clause so far as the sense is
concerned. The "gate between the two walls, which (was) at or over (על)
the king's garden," was a gate at the mouth of the Tyropoeon, that is to
say, at the south-eastern corner of the city of Zion; for, according to
[Neh 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015), the king's garden was at
the pool of Siloah, i.e., at the mouth of the Tyropoeon (see Rob. Pal.
ii. 142). By this defile, therefore, the approach to the city was barred
by a double wall, the inner one running from Zion to the Ophel, whilst
the outer one, at some distance off, connected the Zion wall with the
outer surrounding wall of the Ophel, and most probably enclosed the
king's garden. The subject to ויּלך is המּלך, which has dropped out
before הם וכל־אנשׁי. הערבה is the lowland valley on both sides of the
Jordan (see at [Deu 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)).

[Kg2 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#005)

As the Chaldaeans were encamped around the city, the flight was
immediately discovered. The Chaldaean army pursued him, and overtook him
in the steppes of Jericho, whilst his own army was dispersed, all of
which Ezekiel had foreseen in the Spirit ([Eze
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#003).). ירחו ערבות are that portion of
the plain of the Jordan which formed the country round Jericho (see at
[Jos 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013)).

[Kg2 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#006)

Zedekiah having been seized by the Chaldaeans, was taken to the king of
Babel in the Chaldaean headquarters at Riblah (see at [Kg2
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033)), and was there put upon his
trial. According to [Kg2 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001),
Nebuchadnezzar had commenced the siege of Jerusalem in person; but
afterwards, possibly not till after the Egyptians who came to relieve
the besieged city had been repulsed, he transferred the continuance of
the siege, which was a prolonged one, to his generals, and retired to
Riblah, to conduct the operations of the whole campaign from thence.
את־פל משׁפּט דּבּר, to conduct judicial proceedings with any one, i.e.,
to hear and judge him. For this Jeremiah constantly uses the plural
משׁפּטם, not only in [Jer 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009) and
[Jer 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005), but also in [Jer
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016) and [Jer
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#012).

[Kg2 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#007)

The punishment pronounced upon Zedekiah was the merited reward of the
breach of his oath, and his hardening himself against the counsel of the
Lord which was announced to him by Jeremiah during the siege, that he
should save not only his own life, but also Jerusalem from destruction,
by a voluntary submission to the Chaldaeans, whereas by obstinate
resistance he would bring an ignominious destruction upon himself, his
family, the city, and the whole people ([Jer
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017)., [Jer
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005); [Jer
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003).). His sons, who, though not
mentioned in [Kg2 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004), had fled with
him and had been taken, and (according to [Jer
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010) and [Jer
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006)) all the nobles (princes) of
Judah, sc. those who had fled with the king, were slain before his eyes.
He himself was then blinded, and led away to Babel, chained with double
chains of brass, and kept a prisoner there till his death ([Jer
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011)); so that, as Ezekiel ([Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013)) had prophesied, he came to
Babel, but did not see the land, and died there. Blinding by pricking
out the eyes was a common punishment for princes among the Babylonians
and Persians (cf. Herod. vii. 18, and Brisson, de region Pers. princip.
p. 589). נחשׁתּים, double brazen chains, are brazen fetters for the
hands and feet. Samson was treated in the same manner by the Philistines
([Jdg 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 25:8</span></span>

Destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. The people carried away to
Babel (cf. Jer 52:12-27, and [Jer
39:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#008)). - In this section we have
first a general account of the destruction of the temple and city ([Kg2
25:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008)), and of the carrying away of
the people ([Kg2 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#011) and [Kg2
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012)), and then a more particular
description of what was done with the metal vessels of the temple ([Kg2
25:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013)), and how the spiritual and
secular leaders of the people who had been taken prisoners were treated
([Kg2 25:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018)).

[Kg2 25:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008)

The destruction of Jerusalem, by the burning of the temple, of the
king's palace, and of all the larger buildings, and by throwing down the
walls, was effected by Nebuzaradan, the chief of the body-guard of
Nebuchadnezzar, on the seventh day of the fifth month in the nineteenth
year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. Instead of the seventh day we have
the tenth in [Jer 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012). This
difference might be reconciled, as proposed by earlier commentators, on
the assumption that the burning of the city lasted several days,
commencing on the seventh and ending on the tenth. But since there are
similar differences met with afterwards ([Kg2
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#017), [Kg2
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019)) in the statement of numbers,
which can only be accounted for from the substitution of similar numeral
letters, we must assume that there is a change of this kind here. Which
of the two dates is the correct one it is impossible to determine. The
circumstance that the later Jews kept the ninth as a fast-day cannot be
regarded as decisive evidence in favour of the date given in Jeremiah,
as Thenius supposes; for in [Zac 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003)
and [Zac 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019) the fasting of the fifth
month is mentioned, but no day is given; and though in the Talmudic
times the ninth day of the month began to be kept as a fast-day, this
was not merely in remembrance of the Chaldaean destruction of Jerusalem,
but of the Roman also, and of three other calamities which had befallen
the nation (see the statement of the Gemara on this subject in
Lightfoot, Opp. ii. p. 139, ed. Leusden, and in Khler on [Zac
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003)), from which we see that the
Gemarists in the most unhistorical manner grouped together different
calamitous events in one single day. The nineteenth year of
Nebuchadnezzar corresponds to the eleventh of Zedekiah (see at [Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012)). Nebuzaradan is not mentioned
in [Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003) among the Chaldaean
generals who forced their way into the city, so that he must have been
ordered to Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar after the taking of the city and
the condemnation of Zedekiah, to carry out the destruction of the city,
the carrying away of the people, and the appointment of a
deputy-governor over those who were left behind in the land. This
explains in a very simple manner how a month could intervene between
their forcing their way into the city, at all events into the lower
city, and the burning of it to the ground, without there being any
necessity to assume, with Thenius, that the city of Zion held out for a
month, which is by no means probable, for the simple reason that the
fighting men had fled with Zedekiah and had been scattered in their
flight. רב־תבּחים = הטּבּחים שׂר in [Gen
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036); [Gen
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001), was with the Babylonians, as
with the Egyptians, the chief of the king's body-guard, whose duty it
was to execute the sentences of death (see at [Gen
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036)). הטּבּחים answers to the הכּרתי
of the Israelites ([Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018), etc.).
In [Jer 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012) we have מלך לפני עמד
instead of מלך עבד, without the אשׁר, which is rarely omitted in prose,
and בּירוּשׁלם instead of ירוּשׁלם: he came into Jerusalem, not he
forced a way into the real Jerusalem (Thenius). The meaning is not
altered by these two variations.

[Kg2 25:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009)

By the words, "every great house," יר כּל־בּתּי את is more minutely
defined: not all the houses to the very last, but simply all the large
houses he burned to the very last, together with the temple and the
royal palaces. The victors used one portion of the dwelling-houses for
their stay in Jerusalem. He then had all the walls of the city
destroyed. In Jeremiah כּל is omitted before חומת, as not being required
for the sense; and also the את before טבּחים רב, which is indispensable
to the sense, and has fallen out through a copyist's oversight.

[Kg2 25:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#011)

The rest of the people he led away, both those who had been left behind
in the city and the deserters who had gone over to the Chaldaeans, and
the remnant of the multitude. ההמון יתר, for which we have האמון יתר in
[Jer 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#015), has been interpreted in
various ways. As אמון signifies an artist or artificer in [Pro
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030), and העם יתר has just preceded
it, we might be disposed to give the preference to the reading האמון, as
Hitzig and Graf have done, and understand by it the remnant of the
artisans, who were called והמּסגּר החרשׁ in [Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014), [Kg2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016). But this view is precluded by
[Jer 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009), where we find הנּשׁארים העם
יתר instead of האמון יתר or ההמון .י These words cannot be set aside by
the arbitrary assumption that they crept into the text through a
copyist's error; for the assertion that they contain a purposeless
repetition is a piece of dogmatical criticism, inasmuch as there is a
distinction drawn in [Jer 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009) between
בּעיר הנּשׁארים העם יתר העם הןּ and הנּשׁארים העם יתר. Consequently
האמון is simply another form for ההמון (ה and א being interchanged) in
the sense of a mass of people, and we have simply the choice left
between two interpretations. Either בּעיר הנּשׁארים העם יתר means the
fighting people left in the city, as distinguished from the deserters
who had fled to the Chaldaeans, and האמון = ההמון יתר in [Jer
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#015), or הנּשׁארים העם יתר in [Jer
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009), the rest of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem; or בּעיר הנּשׁ העם יתר is the people left in Jerusalem
(warriors and non-warriors), and ההמון יתר the rest of the population of
the land outside Jerusalem. The latter is probably the preferable view,
not only because full justice is thereby done to בּעיר in the first
clause, but also because it is evident from the exception mentioned in
[Kg2 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012) that the deportation was
not confined to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but extended to the
population of the whole land. The "poor people," whom he allowed to
remain in the land as vine-dressers and husbandmen, were the common
people, or people without property, not merely in Jerusalem, but
throughout the whole land. הארץ דּלּת = עם־הארץ דּלּת ([Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014)). Instead of מדּלּת we have in
Jeremiah מדּלּות: the plural used in an abstract sense, "the poverty,"
i.e., the lower people, "the poor who had nothing" ([Jer
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010)). Instead of the Chethb לגבים
from גּוּב, secuit, aravit, the Keri has ליגבים from יגב, in the same
sense, after [Jer 52:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#016).

[Kg2 25:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013)

The brazen vessels of the temple were broken in pieces, and the brass,
and smaller vessels of brass, silver, and gold, were carried away.
Compare [Jer 52:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017), where several
other points are mentioned that have been passed over in the account
before us. The pillars of brass (see [Kg1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#015).), the stands (see [Kg1
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027).), and the brazen sea ([Kg1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023).), were broken in pieces, because
it would have been difficult to carry these colossal things away without
breaking them up. On the smaller vessels used in the worship ([Kg2
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#014)) see [Kg1
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040). In [Jer
52:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#018) המּזרקת are also mentioned. [Kg2
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#015) is abridged still more in
contrast with [Jer 52:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#019), and only
המּחתּות and המּזרקות are mentioned, whereas in Jeremiah six different
things are enumerated beside the candlesticks. כּסף...זהב אשׁר, "what
was of gold, gold, what was of silver, silver, the captain of the guard
took away," is a comprehensive description of the objects carried away.
To this there is appended a remark in [Kg2
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#016) concerning the quantity of the
brass of the large vessels, which was so great that it could not be
weighed; and in [Kg2 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#017) a
supplementary notice respecting the artistic work of the two pillars of
brass. וגו העמּוּדים is placed at the head absolutely: as for the
pillars, etc., the brass of all these vessels was not to be weighed. In
[Jer 52:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#020), along with the brazen sea,
the twelve brazen oxen under it are mentioned; and in the description of
the pillars of brass ([Jer 52:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#021).)
there are several points alluded to which are omitted in our books, not
only here, but also in [Kg1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016). For
the fact itself see the explanation given there. The omission of the
twelve oxen in so condensed an account as that contained in our text
does not warrant the inference that these words in Jeremiah are a
spurious addition made by a later copyist, since the assumption that
Ahaz sent the brazen oxen to king Tiglath-pileser cannot be proved from
[Kg2 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017). Instead of אמּה שׁלשׁ we
must read אמּת המשׁ, five cubits, according to [Jer
52:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#022) and [Kg1
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016). The על־השּׂבכה at the end of the
verse is very striking, since it stands quite alone, and when connected
with וגו וכאלּה does not appear to yield any appropriate sense, as the
second pillar was like the first not merely with regard to the
trellis-work, but in its form and size throughout. At the same time, it
is possible that the historian intended to give especial prominence to
the similarity of the two pillars with reference to this one point
alone.

[Kg2 25:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018)

(cf. [Jer 52:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024)). The principal
officers of the temple and city, and sixty men of the population of the
land, who were taken at the destruction of Jerusalem, Nebuzaradan sent
to his king at Riblah, where they were put to death. Seraiah, the high
priest, is the grandfather or great-grandfather of Ezra the scribe ([Ezr
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001); [Ch1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#014)). Zephaniah, a priest of the
second rank (משׁנה כּהן; in Jer. המּשׁנה כּהן: see at [Kg2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004)), is probably the same person as
the son of Maaseiah, who took a prominent place among the priests,
according to [Jer 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001); [Jer
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025)., and [Jer
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003). The "three keepers of the
threshold" are probably the three superintendents of the Levites, whose
duty it was to keep guard over the temple, and therefore were among the
principal officers of the sanctuary.

[Kg2 25:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019)

From the city, i.e., from the civil authorities of the city, Nebuzaradan
took a king's chamberlain (סריס), who was commander of the men of war.
Instead of פקיד הוּא אשׁר we find in [Jer
52:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025) /היה אשׁר, who had been
commander, with an allusion to the fact that his official function had
terminated when the city was conquered. "And five (according to Jeremiah
seven) men of those who saw the king's face," i.e., who belonged to the
king's immediate circle, de intimis consiliariis regis, and "the scribe
of the commander-in-chief, who raised the people of the land for
military service," or who enrolled them. Although הסּפר has the article,
which is omitted in Jeremiah, the following words הצּבא שׂר are governed
by it, or connected with it in the construct state (Ewald, 290 d.).
הצּבא שׂר is the commander-in-chief of the whole of the military forces,
and וגו המּצבּא a more precise definition of הסּפר, and not of הצּבא
שׂר, which needed no such definition. "And sixty men of the
land-population who were found in the city." They were probably some of
the prominent men of the rural districts, or they may have taken a
leading part in the defence of the city, and therefore were executed in
Riblah, and not merely deported with the rest of the people. - The
account of the destruction of the kingdom of Judah closes with יהוּדה
ויּגּל in [Kg2 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021), "thus was Judah
carried away out of its own land;" and in [Kg2
25:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022) there follows merely a brief
notice of those who had been left behind in the land, in the place of
which we find in [Jer 52:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#028) a
detailed account of the number of those who were carried away.

Installation of Gedaliah the governor. His assassination, and the flight
of the people to Egypt. - Much fuller accounts have been handed down to
us in Jer 40-44 of the events which are but briefly indicated here.

[Kg2 25:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022)

Over the remnant of the people left in the land Nebuchadnezzar placed
Gedaliah as governor of the land, who took up his abode in Mizpah.
Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, who had interested himself on behalf of the
prophet Jeremiah and saved his life ([Jer
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024)), and the grandson of Shaphan, a
man of whom nothing more is known (see at [Kg2
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#012)), had his home in Jerusalem,
and, as we may infer from his attitude towards Jeremiah, had probably
secured the confidence of the Chaldaeans at the siege and conquest of
Jerusalem by his upright conduct, and by what he did to induce the
people to submit to the judgment inflicted by God; so that
Nebuchadnezzar entrusted him with the oversight of those who were left
behind in the land-men, women, children, poor people, and even a few
princesses and court-officials, whom they had not thought it necessary
or worth while to carry away ([Jer
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007); [Jer
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010), [Jer
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016)), i.e., he made him governor of
the conquered land. Mizpah is the present Nebi Samwil, two hours to the
north-west of Jerusalem (see at [Jos
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026)). - On hearing of Gedaliah's
appointment as governor, there came to him "all the captains of the
several divisions of the army and their men," i.e., those portions of
the army which had been scattered at the flight of the king ([Kg2
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#005)), and which had escaped from the
Chaldaeans, and, as it is expressed in [Jer
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007), had dispersed themselves "in the
field," i.e., about the land. Instead of והאנשׁים we have in [Jer
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007) the clearer expression ואנשׁיהם,
"and their men," whilst והאנשׁים in our text receives its more precise
definition from the previous word החילים. Of the military commanders the
following are mentioned by name: Ishmael, etc. (the ו eht( .cte ,l
before ישׁמעאל, is explic., "and indeed Ishmael"). Ishmael, son of
Mattaniah and grandson of Elishama, probably of the king's secretary
mentioned in [Jer 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#012) and [Jer
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020), of royal blood. Nothing further
is known about the other names. We simply learn from [Jer
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#013). that Johanan had warned
Gedaliah against the treachery of Ishmael, and that when Gedaliah was
slain by Ishmael, having disregarded the warning, he put himself at the
head of the people and marched with them to Egypt, notwithstanding the
dissuasions of Jeremiah ([Jer 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#015).).
Instead of "Johanan the son of Kareah," we have in [Jer
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008) "Johanan and Jonathan the sons of
Kareah;" but it is uncertain whether ויונתן has crept into the text of
Jeremiah from the previous יהוחנן merely through a mistake, and this
mistake has brought with it the alteration of בּן into בּני (Ewald), or
whether ויונתן has dropped out of our text through an oversight, and
this omission has occasioned the alteration of בני into בן (Thenius,
Graf, etc.). The former supposition is favoured by the circumstance that
in [Jer 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#013); [Jer
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#011), [Jer
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016), Johanan the son of Kareah alone
is mentioned. In [Jer 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008) עופי וּבני
(Chethb עיפי) stands before הנּטפתי, according to which it was not
Seraiah who sprang from Netophah, but Ophai whose sons were military
commanders. He was called Netophathite because he sprang from Netopha in
the neighbourhood of Bethlehem ([Neh
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#026); [Ezr
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#022)), the identity of which with Beit
Nettif is by no means probable (see at [Sa2
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#028)). The name יאזביהוּ is written
יזניהוּ in Jeremiah; he was the son of the Maachathite, i.e., his father
sprang from the Syrian district of Maacah in the neighbourhood of the
Hermon (see at [Deu 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014)).

[Kg2 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#024)

As these men were afraid of the vengeance of the Chaldaeans because they
had fought against them, Gedaliah assured them on oath that they had
nothing to fear from them if they would dwell peaceably in the land, be
submissive to the king of Babel, and cultivate the land (cf. [Jer
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#009) and [Jer
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#010)). "Servants of the Chaldees" are
Chaldaean officials who were subordinate to the governor Gedaliah.

[Kg2 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025)

In the seventh month, i.e., hardly two months after the destruction of
Jerusalem, came Ishmael with ten men to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and murdered
him together with the Jews and Chaldaeans, whom he had with him as
soldiers to do his bidding and for his protection. This occurred,
according to [Jer 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001)., when Gedaliah
had received them hospitably and had invited them to eat with him.
Ishmael was instigated to commit this murder by the Ammonitish king
Baalis, and Gedaliah had previously been made acquainted with the
intended crime and put upon his guard by Johanan, but had put no faith
in the information ([Jer 40:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#013)).

[Kg2 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#026)

After Ishmael had performed this deed, and had also treacherously
murdered a number of men, who had come to the temple with a sacrifice
from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria, he took the Jews who were at Mizpah
prisoners, with some kings' daughters among them, intending to take them
over to the Ammonites; but as soon as his deed became known, he was
pursued by Johanan and the rest of the military chiefs and was overtaken
at Gibeon, whereupon those who had been led away by him went over to
Johanan, so that he was only able to make his escape with eight men and
get away to the Ammonites ([Jer
41:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#004)). Johanan then went with the
rest of the military commanders and the people whom he had brought back
into the neighbourhood of Bethlehem, with the intention of fleeing to
Egypt for fear of the Chaldaeans. There they did indeed have recourse to
the prophet Jeremiah, to inquire of him the word of the Lord; but they
did not allow themselves to be diverted from their intention by the word
of the Lord which he announced to them, that if they remained in the
land they need not fear anything from the king of Babel, but if they
went to Egypt they should all perish there with sword, hunger, and
pestilence, or by the prediction that the Lord would also deliver
Pharaoh Hophra into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar (Jer 42). They went to
Egypt notwithstanding, taking the prophet himself with them, and settled
in different cities of Egypt, where they gave themselves up to idolatry,
and did not suffer themselves to be drawn away from it even by the
severe judgments which the prophet Jeremiah predicted as sure to fall
upon them ([Jer 43:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001) and 44). In
the verse before us we have simply a brief allusion to the eventual
result of the whole affair. "Because they were afraid of the
Chaldaeans," namely, that they might possibly take vengeance upon them
for the murder of the governor.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 25:27</span></span>

Jehoiachin delivered from prison, and exalted to royal honours (cf. Jer.
42:31-34). - In the thirty-seventh year after his deportation Jehoiachin
was taken out of prison by Evil-merodach when he came to the throne.
מלכו בּשׁנת, in the year of his becoming king, probably immediately
after he had ascended the throne, for it was no doubt an act of grace at
the commencement of his reign. את־ראשׁ נשׂא, to lift up a persons' head,
i.e., to release him from prison and exalt him to civil honours and
dignities (cf. [Gen 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#013)). On the
coincidence of the thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin's imprisonment and
the commencement of the reign of Evil-merodach see the remarks at [Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012). Instead of the 27th day of the
month, the 25th is given in Jeremiah, again through the substitution of
similar numeral letters (see at [Kg2
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008)). Evil-merodach: מרדך אויל, Εὔιαλ
Μαρώδαχ or Εὐιαλμαρωδέκ (lxx); Ἰλλοαροόδαμος, possibly a copyist's error
for Ἰλμαροόδακος, in the Can. Ptol., and in other forms also: see M. v.
Nieb. Gesch. Ass. p. 42, and Ges. thes. p. 41; compounded from the name
of the Babylonian god Merodach (see at [Kg2
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012)) and the prefix Evil, which has
not yet been explained with certainty. He reigned two years, according
to Berosus in Jos. c. Ap. i. 20, and the Can Ptol.; and according to the
verdict of Berosus, προστὰς τῶν πραγμάτων ἀνόμως καὶ ἀσελγῶς; and was
murdered by his brother-in-law Neriglissor. The statement in Jos. Ant.
x. 11, 2, to the effect that he reigned eighteen years, and that of
Alex. Polyh. in Euseb. Chr. arm. i. p. 45, that he reigned twelve years,
are evidently false.

[Kg2 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#028)

"He spake kindly to him (cf. [Jer
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#006)), and set his throne above the
throne of the kings who were with him in Babel." This is not to be
understood literally, as signifying that he assigned him a loftier
throne than the other kings (Hitzig, Thenius), but figuratively: loco
honestiore eum habuit (Ros.). The "kings with him" were dethroned kings,
who were kept at the court like Jehoiachin to add to its splendour, just
as Cyrus kept the conquered Croesus by his side (Herod. i. 88).

[Kg2 25:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#029)

"And he (Jehoiachin) changed his prison garments," i.e., took them off
and put other regal clothing on (cf. [Gen
41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042)). "And ate continually before
him all his life," i.e., ate at the king's table (cf. [Sa2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#007)). Moreover a daily ration of food
was supplied to him by the king for the maintenance of his retainers,
who formed his little court. The חיּיו כּל־ימי of [Kg2
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#030), upon which Thenius throws
suspicion without any reason, refers to Jehoiachin like that in [Kg2
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#029); for the historian intended to
show how Jehoiachin had fared from the day of his elevation to the end
of his life. At the same time, we cannot infer from this with any
certainty that Jehoiachin died before Evil-merodach; for the favour
shown to him might be continued by Evil-merodach's successor. We cannot
make any safe conjecture as to the motives which induced Evil-merodach
to pardon Jehoiachin and confer this distinction upon him. The higher
ground of this joyful termination of his imprisonment lay in the
gracious decree of God, that the seed of David, though severely
chastised for its apostasy from the Lord, should not be utterly rejected
([Sa2 7:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014)). At the same time, this
event was also intended as a comforting sign to the whole of the captive
people, that the Lord would one day put an end to their banishment, if
they would acknowledge that it was a well-merited punishment for this
sins that they had been driven away from before His face, and would turn
again to the Lord their God with all their heart.
