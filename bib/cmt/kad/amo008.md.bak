### [Amos Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 8:0</span></span>

The Ripeness of Israel for Judgment - [Amo
8:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md)

Under the symbol of a basket filled with ripe fruit, the Lord shows the
prophet that Israel is ripe for judgment ([Amo
8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001).md); whereupon Amos, explaining the
meaning of this vision, announces to the unrighteous magnates of the
nation the changing of their joyful feasts into days of mourning, as the
punishment from God for their unrighteousness ([Amo
8:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004).md), and sets before them a time
when those who now despise the word of God will sigh in vain in their
extremity for a word of the Lord ([Amo
8:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011).md).

[Amos 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 8:1</span></span>

Vision of a Basket of Ripe Fruit. - [Amo
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md). "Thus did the Lord Jehovah show
me: and behold a basket with ripe fruit. [Amo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002.md). And He said, What seest thou,
Amos? And I said, A basket of ripe fruit. Then Jehovah said to me, The
end is come to my people Israel; I will not pass by them any more. [Amo
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#003.md). And the songs of the palace will
yell in that day, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah: corpses in
multitude; in every place hath He cast them forth: Hush!" כּלוּב from
כּלך, to lay hold of, to grasp, lit., a receiver, here a basket (of
basket-work), in [Jer 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#027.md) a
bird-cage. קיץ: summer-fruit (see at [Sa2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001).md); in [Isa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md); [Isa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004.md), the gathering of fruit, hence
ripe fruit. The basket of ripe fruit (qayits) is thus explained by the
Lord: the end (qēts) is come to my people (cf. [Eze
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#006).md). Consequently the basket of ripe
fruit is a figurative representation of the nation that is now ripe for
judgment, although qēts, the end, does not denote its ripeness for
judgment, but its destruction, and the word qēts is simply chosen to
form a paronomasia with qayits. לא אוסיף וגו as in [Amo
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#008.md). All the joy shall be turned into
mourning. the thought is not that the temple-singing to the praise of
God ([Amo 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023).md) would be turned into
yelling, but that the songs of joy ([Amo
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005.md); [Sa2
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#036).md) would be turned into yells,
i.e., into sounds of lamentation (cf. [Amo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010) and 1 Maccabees 9:41.md), namely,
because of the multitude of the dead which lay upon the ground on every
side. השׁליך is not impersonal, in the sense of "which men are no longer
able to bury on account of their great number, and therefore cast away
in quiet places on every side;" but Jehovah is to be regarded as the
subject, viz., which God has laid prostrate, or cast to the ground on
every side. For the adverbial use of הס cannot be established. The word
is an interjection here, as in [Amo
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010.md); and the exclamation, Hush! is
not a sign of gloomy despair, but an admonition to bow beneath the
overwhelming severity of the judgment of God, as in [Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md) (cf. [Hab
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md) and [Zac
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013).md).

[Amos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 8:4</span></span>

To this vision the prophet attaches the last admonition to the rich and
powerful men of the nation, to observe the threatening of the Lord
before it is too late, impressing upon them the terrible severity of the
judgment. [Amo 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004.md). "Hear this, ye
that gape for the poor, and to destroy the meek of the earth, [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md). Saying, When is the new moon
over, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may open wheat, to
make the ephah small, and the shekel great, and to falsify the scale of
deceit? [Amo 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#006.md). To buy the poor for
silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and the refuse of the corn
will we sell." The persons addressed are the השּׁאפים אביון, i.e., not
those who snort at the poor man, to frighten him away from any further
pursuit of his rights (Baur), but, according to [Amo
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006.md), those who greedily pant for the
poor man, who try to swallow him (Hitzig). This is affirmed in the
second clause of the verse, in which שׁאפים is to be repeated in thought
before להשׁבּית: they gape to destroy the quiet in the land (ענוי־ארץ =
ענוים, in [Amo 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007).md), "namely by
grasping all property for themselves, [Job
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#008.md); [Isa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008)" (Hitzig.md). [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md) and [Amo
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#006.md) show how they expect to accomplish
their purpose. Like covetous usurers, they cannot even wait for the end
of the feast-days to pursue their trade still further. Chōdēsh, the new
moon, was a holiday on which all trade was suspended, just as it was on
the Sabbath (see at [Num 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md) and
[Kg2 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023).md). השׁבּיר שׁבר, to sell
corn, as in [Gen 41:57](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#057.md). פּתח בּר, to
open up corn, i.e., to open the granaries (cf. [Gen
41:56](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#056).md). In doing so, they wanted to
cheat the poor by small measure (ephah), and by making the shekel great,
i.e., by increasing the price, which was to be weighed out to them; also
by false scales (‛ivvēth, to pervert, or falsify the scale of deceit,
i.e., the scale used for cheating), and by bad corn (mappal, waste or
refuse); that in this way they might make the poor man so poor, that he
would either be obliged to sell himself to them from want and distress
([Lev 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039).md), or be handed over to the
creditor by the court of justice, because he was no longer able to pay
for a pair of shoes, i.e., the very smallest debt (cf. [Amo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006).md).

[Amos 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 8:7</span></span>

Such wickedness as this would be severely punished by the Lord. [Amo
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007.md). "Jehovah hath sworn by the pride
of Jacob, Verily I will not forget all their deeds for ever. [Amo
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008.md). Shall the earth not tremble for
this, and every inhabitants upon it mourn? and all of it rises like the
Nile, and heaves and sinks like the Nile of Egypt." The pride of Jacob
is Jehovah, as in [Hos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md) and [Hos
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#010.md). Jehovah swears by the pride of
Jacob, as He does by His holiness in [Amo
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002.md), or by His soul in [Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008.md), i.e., as He who is the pride and
glory of Israel: i.e., as truly as He is so, will He and must He punish
such acts as these. By overlooking such sins, or leaving them
unpunished, He would deny His glory in Israel. שׁכח, to forget a sin,
i.e., to leave it unpunished. In [Amo
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008.md) the negative question is an
expression denoting strong assurance. "For this" is generally supposed
to refer to the sins; but this is a mistake, as the previous verse
alludes not to the sins themselves, but to the punishment of them; and
the solemn oath of Jehovah does not contain so subordinate and casual a
thought, that we can pass over [Amo
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007.md), and take על זאת as referring back
to [Amo 8:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004.md). It rather refers to the
substance of the oath, i.e., to the punishment of the sins which the
Lord announces with a solemn oath. This will be so terrible that the
earth will quake, and be resolved, as it were, into its primeval
condition of chaos. Râgaz, to tremble, or, when applied to the earth, to
quake, does not mean to shudder, or to be shocked, as Rosenmller
explains it after [Jer 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012.md). Still
less can the idea of the earth rearing and rising up in a stormy manner
to cast them off, which Hitzig supports, be proved to be a biblical idea
from [Isa 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#020.md). The thought is rather
that, under the weight of the judgment, the earth will quake, and all
its inhabitants will be thrown into mourning, as we may clearly see from
the parallel passage in [Amo 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005.md). In
[Amo 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008.md) this figure is carried out
still further, and the whole earth is represented as being turned into a
sea, heaving and falling in a tempestuous manner, just as in the case of
the flood. כּלּהּ, the totality of the earth, the entire globe, will
rise, and swell and fall like waters lashed into a storm. This rising
and falling of the earth is compared to the rising and sinking of the
Nile. According to the Parallel passage in [Amo
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005.md), כּאר is a defective form for
כּיאר, just as בּוּל is for יבוּל in [Job
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#020.md), and it is still further defined
by the expression כּיאור מצרים, which follows. All the ancient versions
have taken it as יאור, and many of the Hebrew codd. (in Kennicott and De
Rossi) have this reading. Nigrash, to be excited, a term applied to the
stormy sea ([Isa 57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020).md). נשׁקה is a
softened form for נשׁקעה, as is shown by שׁקעה in [Amo
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005.md).

[Amos 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 8:9</span></span>

"And it will come to pass on that day, is the saying of the Lord
Jehovah, I cause the sun to set at noon, and make it dark to the earth
in clear day. [Amo 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010.md). And turn your
feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation: and bring
mourning clothes upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and make
it like mourning for an only one, and the end thereof like a bitter
day." The effect of the divine judgment upon the Israelites is depicted
here. Just as the wicked overturn the moral order of the universe, so
will the Lord, with His judgment, break through the order of nature,
cause the sun to go down at noon, and envelope the earth in darkness in
clear day. The words of the ninth verse are not founded upon the idea of
an eclipse of the sun, though Michaelis and Hitzig not only assume that
they are, but actually attempt to determine the time of its occurrence.
An eclipse of the sun is not the setting of the sun (כּוא). But to any
man the sun sets at noon, when he is suddenly snatched away by death, in
the very midst of his life. And this also applies to a nation when it is
suddenly destroyed in the midst of its earthly prosperity. But it has a
still wider application. When the Lord shall come to judgment, at a time
when the world, in its self-security, looketh not for Him (cf. [Mat
24:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037)..md), this earth's sun will set at
noon, and the earth be covered with darkness in bright daylight. And
every judgment that falls upon an ungodly people or kingdom, as the ages
roll away, is a harbinger of the approach of the final judgment. [Amo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010.md). When the judgment shall burst
upon Israel, then will all the joyous feasts give way to mourning and
lamentation (compare [Amo 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#003.md) and [Amo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016.md); [Hos
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013).md). On the shaving of a bald place
as a sign of mourning, see [Isa 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md).
This mourning will be very deep, like the mourning for the death of an
only son (cf. [Jer 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md) and [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md). The suffix in שׂמתּיה (I make
it) does not refer to אבל (mourning), but to all that has been
previously mentioned as done upon that day, to their weeping and
lamenting (Hitzig). אחריתהּ, the end thereof, namely, of this mourning
and lamentation, will be a bitter day (כ is caph verit.; see at [Joe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015).md). This implies that the judgment
will not be a passing one, but will continue.

[Amos 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 8:11</span></span>

And at that time the light and comfort of the word of God will also fail
them. [Amo 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011.md). "Behold, days come,
is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, that I send a hungering into the
land, not a hungering for bread nor a thirst for water, but to hear the
words of Jehovah. [Amo 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#012.md). And they
will reel from sea to sea; and from the north, and even to the east,
they sweep round to seek the word of Jehovah, and will not find it." The
bitterness of the time of punishment is increased by the fact that the
Lord will then withdrawn His word from them, i.e., the light of His
revelation. They who will not now hear His word, as proclaimed by the
prophets, will then cherish the greatest longing for it. Such hunger and
thirst will be awakened by the distress and affliction that will come
upon them. The intensity of this desire is depicted in [Amo
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#012.md). They reel (נוּע as in [Amo
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#008).md) from the sea to the sea; that is
to say, not "from the Dead Sea in the east to the Mediterranean in the
west," for [Joe 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020.md) and [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md) are not cases in point, as the
two seas are defined there by distinct epithets; but as in [Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md) and [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010.md), according to which the meaning
is, from the sea to where the sea occurs again, at the other end of the
world, "the sea being taken as the boundary of the earth" (Hupfeld). The
other clause, "from the north even to the east," contains an abridged
expression for "from north to south and from west to east," i.e., to
every quarter of the globe.

[Amos 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 8:13</span></span>

"In that day will the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst.
[Amo 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014.md). They who swear by the guilt
of Samaria, and say, By the life of thy God, O Dan! and by the life of
the way to Beersheba; and will fall, and not rise again." Those who now
stand in all the fullest and freshest vigour of life, will succumb to
this hunger and thirst. The virgins and young men are individualized, as
comprising that portion of the nation which possessed the vigorous
fulness of youth. עלף, to be enveloped in night, to sink into a swoon,
hithp. to hide one's self, to faint away. הנּשׁבּעים refers to the young
men and virgins; and inasmuch as they represent the most vigorous
portion of the nation, to the nation as a whole. If the strongest
succumb to the thirst, how much more the weak! 'Ashmath Shōmerōn, the
guilt of Samaria, is the golden calf at Bethel, the principal idol of
the kingdom of Israel, which is named after the capital Samaria (compare
[Deu 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021), "the sin of Israel".md), not
the Asherah which was still standing in Samaria in the reign of Jehoahaz
([Kg2 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006).md); for apart from the
question whether it was there in the time of Jeroboam, this is at
variance with the second clause, in which the manner of their swearing
is given, - namely, by the life of the god at Dan, that is to say, the
golden calf that was there; so that the guilt of Samaria can only have
been the golden calf at Bethel, the national sanctuary of the ten tribes
(cf. [Amo 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md); [Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005).md). The way to Beersheba is
mentioned, instead of the worship, for the sake of which the pilgrimage
to Beersheba was made. This worship, again, was not a purely heathen
worship, but an idolatrous worship of Jehovah (see [Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005).md). The fulfilment of these threats
commenced with the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, and the
carrying away of the ten tribes into exile in Assyria, and continues to
this day in the case of that portion of the Israelitish nation which is
still looking for the Messiah, the prophet promised by Moses, and
looking in vain, because they will not hearken to the preaching of the
gospel concerning the Messiah, who appeared as Jesus.
