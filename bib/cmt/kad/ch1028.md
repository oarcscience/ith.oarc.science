David's Last Directions, and His Death - 1 Chronicles 28-29

In order to give over the throne before his death to his son Solomon,
and so secure to him the succession, and facilitate his accomplishment
of the great work of his reign, the building of the temple, David
summoned the estates of his kingdom, the court officials, and the heroes
of the people in Jerusalem. In a solemn address he designated Solomon as
his divinely chosen successor on the throne, and exhorted him to keep
the commandments of God, to serve the Lord with devoted heart, and to
build Him a house for a sanctuary ([Ch1
28:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001)). He then committed to Solomon
the sketches and plans for the sacred buildings and sacred objects of
various sorts, with the confident promise that he, by the help of God,
and with the co-operation of the priests and of the people, would
complete the work ([Ch1 28:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011)).
Finally, he announced, in the presence of the whole assembly, that he
gave over his treasures of gold and silver to this building, and called
upon the chiefs of the people and kingdom for a voluntary contribution
for the same purpose; and on their freely answering this call, concluded
with a solemn prayer of thanks, to which the whole assembly responded,
bowing low before God and the king (29:1-20). This reverence they
confirmed by numerous burnt-offerings and thank-offerings, and by the
repeated anointing of Solomon to be king ([Ch1
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#021) and [Ch1
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#022)).

[1 Chronicles 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 28:1</span></span>

David summoned the estates of the kingdom, and presented Solomon to them
as his divinely chosen successor on the throne.

[Ch1 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001)

"All the princes of Israel" is the general designation, which is then
specialized. In it are included the princes of the tribes who are
enumerated in [Ch1 27:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016), and the
princes of the divisions which served the king, who are enumerated in
[Ch1 27:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001); the princes of thousands
and hundreds are the chiefs and captains of the twelve army corps ([Ch1
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001)), who are subordinate to the
princes of the host: the princes of all the substance and possessions of
the king are the managers of the domains enumerated in [Ch1
27:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025). וּלבניו is added to למּלך,
"of the king and of his sons," because the possession of the king as a
property belonging to the house (domanium) belonged also to his sons.
The Vulg. incorrectly translates לבניו filiosque suos, for in this
connection ל cannot be nota accus. הסּריסים עם, with (together with) the
court officials. סריסים are not eunuchs, but royal chamberlains, as in
[Sa1 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#015); see on [Gen
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036). הגּבּורים has been well
translated by the lxx τοὺς δυνάστας, for here the word does not denote
properly or merely war heroes, but powerful influential men in general,
who did not occupy any special public or court office. In חיל
וּלכל־גּבּור all the others who were present in the assembly are
comprehended.

[Ch1 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002)

The king rose to his feet, in order to speak to the assembly standing;
till then he had, on account of his age and feebleness, sat, not lain in
bed, as Kimchi and others infer from 1 Kings 1.

[Ch1 28:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#003)

The address, "My brethren and my people," is expressive of condescending
goodwill; cf. on אחי, [Sa1 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#023); [Sa2
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#013). What David here says ([Ch1
28:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#003)) of the temple building, he had
in substance already ([Ch1 22:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#007))
said to his son Solomon: I, it was with my heart, i.e., I purposed (cf.
[Ch1 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#007)) to build a house of rest
for the ark of the covenant of Jahve, and the footstool of the feet of
our God, i.e., for the ark and for the capporeth upon it, which is
called "footstool of the feet of our God," because God was enthroned
above the cherubim upon the capporeth. "And I have prepared to build,"
i.e., prepared labour and materials, [Ch1
22:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002) and [Ch1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014).; on [Ch1
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#003), cf. [Ch1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#008). - In [Ch1
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#004) David states how his election to
be king was of God, who had chosen Judah to be ruler (cf. [Ch1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002)); and just so ([Ch1
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#005), [Ch1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#006)) had God chosen Solomon from
among all his many sons to be heir to the throne, and committed to him
the building of the temple; cf. [Ch1
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#010). The expression, "throne of the
kingdom of Jahve," and more briefly, "throne of Jahve" ([Ch1
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#023), or מלכוּתי, [Ch1
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#014)), denotes that Jahve is the true
King of Israel, and had chosen Solomon as He had chosen David to be
holder and administrator of His kingdom dominion. - On [Ch1
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#006) and [Ch1
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#007), cf. [Ch1
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#010) and [Ch1
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#011).; and with the condition וגו
יחזק אם, cf. [Kg1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014); [Kg1
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#004), where God imposes an exactly
similar condition on Solomon. הזּה כּיּום, as is done at this time; cf.
[Kg1 8:61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#061), and the commentary on [Deu
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030). On this speech J. H. Mich. well
remarks: "tota haec narratio aptata est ad prospositum Davidis: vult
enim Salomoni auctoritatem apud principes et fratres conciliare,
ostendendo, non humana, sed divina voluntate electum esse," To this
David adds an exhortation to the whole assembly ([Ch1
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#008)), and to his son Solomon ([Ch1
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009)), to hold fast their faithfulness
to God.

[Ch1 28:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#008)

"And now before the eyes of all Israel, of the congregation of Jahve
(collected in their representatives), and into the ears of our God (so
that God should hear as witness), (scil. I exhort you), observe and seek
... that ye may possess (that is, keep as possession) the good land (cf.
[Deu 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#021).), and leave it to your sons
after you for an inheritance" (cf. [Lev
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#046)). - In [Ch1
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009) he turns to his son Solomon in
particular with the fatherly exhortation, "My son, know thou the God of
thy father (i.e., of David, who has ever helped him, [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003)), and serve Him with whole
(undivided) heart ([Ch1 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#009), [Ch1
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#019); [Kg1
8:61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#061)) and willing soul." To strengthen
this exhortation, David reminds him of the omniscience of God. Jahve
seeks, i.e., searches, all hearts and knows all the imagination of the
thoughts; cf. [Psa 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010); [Sa1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007); [Jer
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020); [Psa
139:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001). מחשׁבות יצר as in [Gen
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005). With the last clauses cf. [Deu
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029); [Isa
55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006), etc. יזניח, only here and [Ch2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#014); [Ch2
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#019). - With [Ch1
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#010) the discourse turns to the
building of the temple. The exhortation ועשׂה חזק is interrupted by the
giving over of the sketches and plans of the temple, and is taken up
again only in [Ch1 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020).

[1 Chronicles 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 28:11</span></span>

The sketches and plans of the sacred buildings and vessels. - The
enumeration begins in [Ch1 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011) with
the temple house, progressing from outside to inside, and in [Ch1
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012) goes on to the courts and the
buildings in them, and in [Ch1 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#013).
to the vessels, etc. תּבנית, model, pattern; cf. [Exo
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#009); here the sketches and drawings
of the individual things. ואת־בּתּיו is a contraction for בּתּיו
ועת־תּבנית, and the suffix refers, as the succeeding words show, not to
העוּלם, but to הבּית, which may be easily supplied from the context
([Ch1 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#010)). In the porch there were
no houses. The בּתּים are the buildings of the temple house, viz., the
holy place and the most holy, with the three-storeyed side-building,
which are specified in the following words. גּנזכּיו occurs only here,
but is related to גּנזים, [Est 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#009);
[Est 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#007); [Eze
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#024), and to the Chald. גּנזין, [Ezr
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#020), and signifies store and treasure
chambers, for which the chambers of the three-storeyed side-building
served. עליּות are the upper chambers over the most holy place, [Ch2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#009); הפּנימים חדריו are the inner
rooms of the porch and of the holy place, since הכּפּרת בּית, the house
of the ark with the mercy-seat, i.e., the most holy place, is mentioned
immediately after.

[Ch1 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012)

And the pattern, i.e., the description of all that was in the spirit
with him, i.e., what his spirit had designed, לחצרות, as to the courts.
סביב לכל־הלּשׁכות, in reference to all the chambers round about, i.e.,
to all the rooms on the four sides of the courts. לאצרות, for the
treasures of the house of God; see on [Ch1
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020).

[Ch1 28:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#013)

הך וּלמחלקות (continuation of לאצרות), "and for the divisions of the
priests and Levites, and for all the work of the service, and for all
vessels," - for for all these purposes, viz., for the sojourn of the
priests and Levites in the service, as well as for the performance of
the necessary works, e.g., preparation of the shew-bread, cooking of the
sacrificial flesh, holding of the sacrificial meals, and for the storing
of the vessels necessary for these purposes, the cells and building of
the courts were set apart. - With [Ch1
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#014) begins the enumeration of the
vessels. לזּהב is co-ordinate with לכל־הלּשׁכות...לחצרות, [Ch1
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012) : he gave him the description of
that which he had in mind "with regard to the golden (i.e., to the
golden vessels, cf. [Ch1 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002)),
according to the weight of the golden, for all vessels of every
service," in regard to all silver vessels according to the weight. -
With [Ch1 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#015) the construction
hitherto employed is dropped. According to the usual supposition, the
verb ויּתּן is to be supplied from [Ch1
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011) after וּמשׁקל: "and gave him the
weight for the golden candlesticks and their golden lamps," זהב being in
a state of free subordination to the word ונרתיהם (J. H. Mich., Berth.,
and others). But apart from the fact that no analogous case can be found
for such a subordination (for in [Ch2
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#015), which Berth. cites as such,
there is no subordination, for there the first שׁחוּט זהב is the
accusative of the material dependent upon ויּעשׂ), the supplying of
ויּתּן gives no suitable sense; for David here does not give Solomon the
metal for the vessels, but, according to [Ch1
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011), [Ch1
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012), [Ch1
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019), only a תּבנית, pattern or model
for them. If ויּתּן be supplied, נתן must be "he appointed," and so have
a different sense here from that which it has in [Ch1
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011). This appears very questionable,
and it is simpler to take משׁקל without the article, as an accusative of
nearer definition, and to connect the verse thus: "and (what he had in
mind) as weight for the golden candlesticks and their lamps, in gold,
according to the weight of each candlestick and its lamps, and for the
silver candlesticks, in weight - כּעבודת, according to the service of
each candlestick" (as it corresponded to the service of each). - In [Ch1
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#016) the enumeration is continued in
very loose connection: "And as to the gold (את, quoad; cf. Ew. 277, d)
by weight (משׁקל, acc. of free subordination) for the tables of the
spreading out, i.e., of the shew-bread (מערכת = לחם מערכת, [Ch2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#011)); see on [Lev
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#006)), for each table, and silver for
the silver tables." Silver tables, i.e., tables overlaid with
silver-lamin, and silver candlesticks ([Ch1
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#015)), are not elsewhere expressly
mentioned among the temple vessels, since the whole of the vessels are
nowhere individually registered even in the description of the building
of the temple. Yet, when the temple was repaired under Joash, [Kg2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#014); [Ch2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#014), and when it was destroyed by
the Chaldeans, [Kg2 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#015), vessels of
gold and silver are spoken of. The silver candlesticks were probably, as
Kimchi has conjectured, intended for the priests engaged in the service,
and the tables for reception of the sacrificial flesh after it had been
prepared for burning upon the altar.

[Ch1 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#017)

Before וגו והמּזלגות we should probably supply from [Ch1
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011) : "he gave him the pattern of
the forks...ולכפורי, and for the golden tankards, according to the
weight of each tankard." For מזלנות and מזרקות, see on [Ch2
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#022). קשׂוה, σπονδεῖα, cups for the
libations, occur only in [Exo 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029);
[Exo 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#016), and [Num
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#007). טהור זהב, in free subordination:
of pure gold. כּפורים from כּפר, to cover, are vessels provided with
covers, tankards; only mentioned here and in [Ezr
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#010); [Ezr
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#027).

[Ch1 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018)

And (the pattern) for the altar of incense of pure gold by weight. In
the second member of the verse, at the close of the enumeration, תּבנית,
from [Ch1 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011), [Ch1
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012), is again taken up, but with ל,
which Berth. rightly takes to be nota accus.: and (gave him) "the model
of the chariot of the cherubim of gold, as spreading out (wings), and
sheltering over the ark of the covenant of Jahve." הכּרוּבים is not
subordinated in the genitive to המּרכּבה, but is in explanatory
apposition to it. The cherubim, not the ark, are the chariot upon which
God enters or is throned; cf. [Psa
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011); [Psa
99:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001); [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022). The conception of the cherubim
set upon the golden cover of the ark as מרכּבה is derived from the idea
על־כּרוּב ירכּב, [Psa 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011). Ezekiel,
it is true, saw wheels on the throne of God under the cherubim ([Eze
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#015)., 26), and in accordance with
this the lxx and Vulg. have made a cherubim-chariot out of the words
(ἅρμα τῶν Χερουβίμ, quadriga cherubim); but as against this Berth.
rightly remarks, that the idea of a chariot of the cherubim does not at
all appear in the two sculptured cherubim upon the ark, nor yet in our
passage. לפרשׂים (without the article, and with ל) Berth. thinks quite
unintelligible, and would alter the text, reading והסּככים הפּרשׂים,
because the two participles should be in apposition to הכּרוּבים. But
this is an error; for neither by the meaning of the words, nor by the
passages, [Ch2 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#008); [Exo
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020); [Kg1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#007), are we compelled to make this
alteration. The two first-mentioned passages prove the opposite, viz.,
that these participles state for what purpose the cherubim are to serve.
וסככים לפרשׂים have the signification of כּנפים פּרשׂי הכּרוּבים והיוּ,
"that the cherubim might be spreading wings and protecting" ([Exo
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020)), as J. H. Mich. has rightly
seen. This use of ל, where in ל even without a verb the idea of
"becoming something" lies, but which Berth. does not understand, has
been already discussed, Ew. 217, d, and illustrated by passages, among
which [Ch1 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018) is one. The reference
to [Exo 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020) explains also the use of
פּרשׂ without כּנפים, the author of the Chronicle not thinking it
necessary to give the object of פּרשׂ, as he might assume that that
passage would be known to readers of his book.

[Ch1 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019)

In giving over to Solomon the model of all the parts and vessels of the
temple enumerated in [Ch1 28:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011),
David said: "All this, viz., all the works of the pattern, has He taught
by writing from the hand of Jahve which came upon me." הכּל is more
closely defined by the apposition הת מלאכות כּל . That the verse
contains words of David is clear from עלי. The subject of השׂכּיל is
Jahve, which is easily supplied from יהוה מיּד. It is, however, a
question with what we should connect עלי. Its position before the verb,
and the circumstance that השׂכּיל construed with על pers. does not
elsewhere, occur, are against its being taken with השׂכּיל; and there
remains, therefore, only the choice between connecting it with יהוה מיּד
and with בּכתב. In favour of the last, [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008), עלי כּתוּב, prescribed to me,
may be compared; and according to that, עלי כּתב can only mean, "what is
prescribed to me;" cf. for the use of כּתב for written prescription, the
command in [Ch2 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#004). Bertheau
accordingly translates עלי יהוה מיּד בּכתב, "by a writing given to me
for a rule from Jahve's hand," and understands the law of Moses to be
meant, because the description of the holy things in [Exo
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001). is manifestly the basis of that
in our verses. But had David wished to say nothing further than that he
had taken the law in the Scriptures for the basis of his pattern for the
holy things, the expression which he employs would be exceedingly forced
and wilfully obscure. And, moreover, the position of the words would
scarcely allow us to connect בּכתב with עלי, for in that case we should
rather have expected יהוה מיּד עלי בּכתב. We must there take עלי along
with יהוה מיּד: "writing from the hand of Jahve came upon me," i.e.,
according to the analogy of the phrase עלי יהוה יד היתה ([Kg2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#015); [Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003); [Eze
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014), etc.), a writing coming by
divine revelation, or a writing composed in consequence of divine
revelation, and founded upon divine inspiration. David therefore says
that he had been instructed by a writing resting upon divine inspiration
as to all the works of the pattern of the temple. This need not,
however, be understood to mean that David had received exemplar vel
ideam templi et vasorum sacrorum immediately from Jahve, either by a
prophet or by vision, as the model of the tabernacle was shown to Moses
on the mount ([Exo 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040); [Exo
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#008)); for it signifies only that he
had not himself invented the pattern which he had committed to writings,
i.e., the sketches and descriptions of the temple and its furniture and
vessels, but had drawn them up under the influence of divine
inspiration.

[1 Chronicles 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 28:20</span></span>

In conclusion, David encourages his son to go forward to the work with
good courage, for his God would not forsake him; and the priests and
Levites, cunning workmen, and the princes, together with the whole
people, would willingly support him. With the encouragement, [Ch1
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020), cf. [Ch1
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#013); and with the promise, [Ch1
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020), cf. [Deu
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006), [Deu
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#008); [Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005). אלהי, my God, says David, ut in
mentem ei revocet, quomodo multis in periculis servatus sit (Lav.).
עבודה כּל־מלאכת, all the work-business, i.e., all the labour necessary
for the building of the house of God.

[Ch1 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#021)

והנּה is fittingly translated by Clericus, "en habes." The reference
which lies in the הנּה to the classes of the priests and Levites, i.e.,
the priests and Levites divided into classes, does not presuppose their
presence in the assembly. With the והנּה corresponds ועמּך, with thee,
i.e., for assistance to thee, in the second half of the verse. The ל
before לכל-naadiyb, "are all freely willing with wisdom," in the middle
of the sentence introducing the subject is strange; Bertheau would
therefore strike it out, thinking that, as לכל goes immediately before,
and follows immediately afterwards twice, לכל here may easily be an
error for כל. This is certainly possible; but since this ל is very
frequently used in the Chronicle, it is a question whether it should not
be regarded as authentic, "serving to bring into emphatic prominence the
idea of the ndyb kl: with thee is for each business, what regards each
willing person, for also all willing persons;" cf. Ew. 310, a. נדיב = לב
נדיב, [Ch2 29:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#031); [Exo
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#005), [Exo
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022), usually denotes him who brings
voluntary gifts, but here, him who voluntarily brings wisdom to every
service, who willingly employs his wisdom and knowledge in a service.
Cunning, intelligent workmen and artists are meant, [Ch1
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#015); [Ch2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006). לכל־דּבריך, "towards all thy
words," i.e., as thou sayest or commandest them, the princes and the
people, or callest upon them for assistance in the work.
