### [2 Chronicles Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 36:0</span></span>

The Last Kings of Judah; the Destruction of Jerusalem; Judah Led Away
Captive; and the Babylonian Exile - 2 Chronicles 36

As the kingdom of Judah after Josiah's death advanced with swift steps
to its destruction by the Chaldeans, so the author of the Chronicle goes
quickly over the reigns of the last kings of Judah, who by their godless
conduct hastened the ruin of the kingdom. As to the four kings who
reigned between Josiah's death and the destruction of Jerusalem, he
gives, besides their ages at their respective accessions, only a short
characterization of their conduct towards God, and a statement of the
main events which step by step brought about the ruin of the king and
the burning of Jerusalem and the temple.

[2 Chronicles 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 36:1</span></span>

The reign of Jehoahaz. Cf. [Kg2
23:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030.md). - After Josiah's death, the
people of the land raised his son Jehoahaz (Joahaz), who was then
twenty-three years old, to the throne; but he had been king in Jerusalem
only three months when the Egyptian king (Necho) deposed him, imposed
upon the land a fine of 100 talents of silver and one talent of gold,
made his brother Eliakim king under the name Jehoiakim, and carried
Jehoahaz, who had been taken prisoner, away captive to Egypt. For
further information as to the capture and carrying away of Jehoahaz, and
the appointment of Eliakim to be king, see on [Kg2
23:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md).

[2 Chronicles 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 36:5</span></span>

The reign of Jehoiakim. Cf. 2 Kings 23:36-24:7. - Jehoiakim was at his
accession twenty-five years of age, reigned eleven years, and did that
which was evil in the eyes of Jahve his God.

[Ch2 36:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006.md)

"Against him came Nebuchadnezzar (in inscriptions, Nabucudurriusur,
i.e., Nebo coronam servat; see on Dan. S. 56) the king of Babylon, and
bound him with brazen double fetters to carry him to Babylon." This
campaign, Nebuchadnezzar's first against Judah, is spoken of also in 2
Kings 24 and [Dan 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md). The capture
of Jerusalem, at which Jehoiakim was put in fetters, occurred, as we
learn from [Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md), col. c. [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002.md) and [Jer
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md), in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim's reign, i.e., in the year 606 b.c.; and with it commence the
seventy years of the Chaldean servitude of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar did not
carry out his purpose of deporting the captured king Jehoiakim to
Babylon, but allowed him to continue to reign at Jerusalem as his
servant (vassal). To alter the infin. להוליכו into the perf., or to
translate as the perf., is quite arbitrary, as is also the supplying of
the words, "and he carried him away to Babylon." That the author of the
Chronicle does not mention the actual carrying away, but rather assumes
the contrary, namely, that Jehoiakim continued to reign in Jerusalem
until his death, as well known, is manifest from the way in which, in
[Ch2 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#008.md), he records his son's
accession to the throne. He uses the same formula which he has used in
the case of all the kings whom at their death their sons succeeded,
according to established custom. Had Nebuchadnezzar dethroned Jehoiakim,
as Necho deposed Jehoahaz, the author of the Chronicle would not have
left the installation of Jehoiachin by the Chaldean king unmentioned.
For the defence of this view against opposing opinions, see the
commentary on [Kg2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md) and [Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md); and in regard to [Ch2
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007.md), see on [Dan
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002.md). The Chronicle narrates nothing
further as to Jehoiakim's reign, but refers, [Ch2
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#008.md), for his other deeds, and
especially his abominations, to the book of the kings of Israel and
Judah, whence the most important things have been excerpted and
incorporated in [Kg2 24:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md). עשׂה אשׁר
תּועבותיו Bertheau interprets of images which he caused to be prepared,
and עליו הנּמצא of his evil deeds; but in both he is incorrect. The
passages which Bertheau cites for his interpretation of the first words,
[Jer 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009.md). and [Eze
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017.md), prove the contrary; for Jeremiah
mentions as תּועבות of the people, murder, adultery, false swearing,
offering incense to Baal, and going after other gods; and Ezekiel, loc.
cit., uses תּועבות עשׂות of the idolatry of the people indeed, but not
of the making of images - only of the worship of idols, the practice of
idol-worship. The abominations, consequently, which Jehoiakim committed
are both his evil deeds and crimes, e.g., the shedding of innocent blood
([Kg2 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#004).md), as well as the idolatry
which he had practised. עליו הנּמצא, "what was found upon him," is a
comprehensive designation of his whole moral and religious conduct and
attitude; cf. [Ch2 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#003.md). Jehoiakim's
revolt from Nebuchadnezzar after three years' servitude ([Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md) is passed over by the author of
the Chronicle, because the punishment of this crime influenced the fate
of the kingdom of Judah only after his death. The punishment fell upon
Jehoiachin; for the detachments of Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites,
which were sent by Nebuchadnezzar to punish the rebels, did not
accomplish much.

[2 Chronicles 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 36:9</span></span>

The reign of Jehoiachin. Cf. [Kg2
24:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md). - Jehoiachin's age at his
accession is here given as eight years, while in [Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md) it is eighteen. It is so also in
the lxx and Vulg.; but a few Hebr. codd., Syr., and Arab., and many
manuscripts of the lxx, have eighteen years in the Chronicle also. The
number eight is clearly an orthographical error, as Thenius also
acknowledges. Bertheau, on the contrary, regards the eight of our text
as the original, and the number eighteen in 2 Kings as an alteration
occasioned by the idea that eighteen years appeared a more fitting age
for a king than eight years, and gives as his reason, "that the king's
mother is named along with him, and manifestly with design, [Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012.md), [Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015.md), and [Jer
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#026.md), whence we must conclude that
she had the guardianship of the young king." A perfectly worthless
reason. In the books of Kings the name of the mother is given in the
case of all the kings after their accession has been mentioned, without
any reference to the age of the kings, because the queen-mother occupied
a conspicuous position in the kingdom. It is so in the case of Jehoiakim
and Jehoiachin, [Kg2 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#036.md) and [Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md). On account of her high position,
the queen-mother is mentioned in [Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012.md) and [Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015.md), and in Jeremiah, among those
who submitted to Nebuchadnezzar and were carried away to Babylon. The
correctness of the number eighteen is, however, placed beyond doubt by
[Eze 19:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005.md), where the prophet
portrays Jehoiachin as a young lion, which devoured men, and knew
widows, and wasted cities. The knowing of widows cannot apply to a boy
of eight, but might well be said of a young man of eighteen. Jehoiachin
ruled only three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and did evil in the
eyes of Jahve. At the turn of the year, i.e., in spring, when campaigns
were usually opened (cf. [Kg1 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#022.md);
[Sa2 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001).md), Nebuchadnezzar sent his
generals ([Kg2 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010).md), and brought him
to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jahve, and made his
(father's) brother Zedekiah king in Judah. In these few words the end of
Jehoiachin's short reign is recorded. From [Kg2
24:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010.md) we learn more as to this
second campaign of Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem, and its issues for
Judah; see the commentary on that passage. Zidkiyah (Zedekiah) was,
according to [Kg2 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017.md), not a
brother, but דּוד, uncle or father's brother, of Jehoiachin, and was
called Mattaniah, a son of Josiah and Hamutal, like Jehoahaz ([Kg2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md), cf. [Kg2
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031).md), and is consequently his full
brother, and a step-brother of Jehoiakim. At his appointment to the
kingdom by Nebuchadnezzar he received the name Zidkiyah (Zedekiah).
אהיו, in [Ch2 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010.md), is accordingly to
be taken in its wider signification of blood-relation.

[2 Chronicles 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 36:11</span></span>

The reign of Zedekiah; the destruction of Jerusalem, and Judah carried
away into exile. Cf. 2 Kings 24:18-25:21. - Zedekiah, made king at the
age of twenty-one years, reigned eleven years, and filled up the measure
of sins, so that the Lord was compelled to give the kingdom of Judah up
to destruction by the Chaldeans. To that Zedekiah brought it by the two
main sins of his evil reign, - namely, by not humbling himself before
the prophet Jeremiah, from the mouth of Jahve ([Ch2
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#012).md); and by rebelling against King
Nebuchadnezzar, who had caused him to swear by God, and by so hardening
his neck (being stiff-necked), and making stout his heart, that he did
not return to Jahve the God of Israel. Zedekiah's stiffness of neck and
hardness of heart showed itself in his refusing to hearken to the words
which Jeremiah spoke to him from the mouth of God, and his breaking the
oath he had sworn to Nebuchadnezzar by God. The words, "he humbled
himself not before Jeremiah," recall [Jer
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#002.md), and the events narrated in Jer
37 and 38, and 21:4-22:9, which show how the chief of the people
ill-treated the prophet because of his prophecies, while Zedekiah was
too weak and languid to protect him against them. The rebellion against
Nebuchadnezzar, to whom he had sworn a vassal's oath of fidelity, is
mentioned in [Kg2 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020.md), and [Eze
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013.md). also, as a great crime on the
part of Zedekiah and the chief of the people; see the commentary on both
passages. In consequence of this rebellion, Nebuchadnezzar marched
against Judah with a powerful army; and after the capture of the fenced
cities of the land, he advanced to the siege of Jerusalem, which ended
in its capture and destruction, [Kg2
25:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md). Without further noticing
these results of this breach of faith, the author of the Chronicle
proceeds to depict the sins of the king and of the people. In the first
place, he again brings forward, in [Ch2
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013.md), the stiffness of neck and
obduracy of the king, which manifested itself in the acts just
mentioned: he made hard his neck, etc. Bertheau would interpret the
words וגו ויּקשׁ, according to [Deu
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030.md), thus: "Then did God make him
stiff-necked and hardened his heart; so that he did not return to Jahve
the God of Israel, notwithstanding the exhortations of the prophets."
But although hardening is not seldom represented as inflicted by God,
there is here no ground for supposing that with ויּקשׁ the subject is
changed, while the bringing forward of the hardening as an act of God
does not at all suit the context. And, moreover, ערף הקשׁה, making hard
the neck, is nowhere ascribed to God, it is only said of men; cf. [Kg2
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#014.md); [Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md); [Jer
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015.md), etc. To God only את־לב הקשׁה or
את־רוּח is attributed, [Exo 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003.md); [Deu
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030.md).

[2 Chronicles 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 36:14</span></span>

"And all princes of the priests and the people increased faithless
transgressions, like to all the abominations of the heathen, and defiled
the house of the Lord which He had consecrated in Jerusalem." Bertheau
would refer this censure of their idolatry and the profanation of the
temple to the guilt incurred by the whole people, especially in the time
of Manasseh, because, from all we know from the book of Jeremiah, the
reproach of idolatry did not at all, or at least did not specially,
attach to the princes of the priests and the people in the time of
Zedekiah. But this reason is neither tenable nor correct; for from Ezek
8 it is perfectly manifest that under Zedekiah, not only the people, but
also the priesthood, were deeply sunk in idolatry, and that even the
courts of the temple were defiled by it. And even though that idolatry
did not take its rise under Zedekiah, but had been much practised under
Jehoiakim, and was merely a revival and continuation of the idolatrous
conduct of Manasseh and Amon, yet the reference of our verse to the time
of Manasseh is excluded by the context; for here only that which was
done under Zedekiah is spoken of, without any reference to earlier
times.

Meanwhile God did not leave them without exhortation, warning, and
threatening. - [Ch2 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015.md). Jahve sent
to them by His messengers, from early morning onwards continually, for
He spared His people and His dwelling-place; but they mocked the
messengers of God, despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets. בּיד
שׁלח, to send a message by any one, to make a sending. The object is to
be supplied from the verb. ושׁלוח השׁכּם exactly as in [Jer
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#005.md); [Jer
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#019.md). For He spared His people, etc.,
viz., by this, that He, in long-suffering, again and again called upon
the people by prophets to repent and return, and was not willing at once
to destroy His people and His holy place. מלעיבים is ἁπ. λεγ., in Syr.
it signifies subsannavit; the Hithp. also, מתּעתּעים (from תּעע), occurs
only here as an intensive: to launch out in mockery. The distinction
drawn between מלאכים (messengers) and נביאים (prophets) is rhetorical,
for by the messengers of God it is chiefly prophets who are meant; but
the expression is not to be confined to prophets in the narrower sense
of the word, for it embraces all the men of God who, by word and deed,
censured and punished the godless conduct of the idolaters. The
statement in these two verses is certainly so very general, that it may
apply to all the times of gradually increasing defection of the people
from the Lord their God; but the author of the Chronicle had primarily
in view only the time of Zedekiah, in which the defection reached its
highest point. It should scarcely be objected that in the time of
Zedekiah only Jeremiah is known as a prophet of the Lord, since Ezekiel
lived and wrought among the exiles. For, in the first place, it does not
hence certainly follow that Jeremiah and Ezekiel were the only prophets
of that time; then, secondly, Jeremiah does not speak as an individual
prophet, but holds up to the people the witness of all the earlier
prophets (cf. e.g., [Ch2 26:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#004).md), so
that by him all the former prophets of God spoke to the people; and
consequently the plural, His messengers, His prophets, is perfectly true
even for the time of Zedekiah, if we always keep in mind the rhetorical
character of the style. וגו עלות עד, until the anger of Jahve rose upon
His people, so that there was no healing (deliverance) more.

[2 Chronicles 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 36:17</span></span>

When the moral corruption had reached this height, judgment broke upon
the incorrigible race. As in [Ch2
36:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#012.md) the transgressions of the
king and people are not described according to their historical
progression, but are portrayed in rhetorical gradation; so, too, in [Ch2
36:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017.md) the judgment upon the sinful
people and kingdom is not represented in its historical details, but
only rhetorically in its great general outlines. "Then brought He upon
them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword
in their sanctuary, and spared not the youth and the maiden, the old man
and the grey-headed; he gave everything into his hand." Prophetic
utterances form the basis of this description of the fearful judgment,
e.g., [Jer 15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001.md); [Jer
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003.md)., [Eze
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006.md); and these, again, rest upon [Deu
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#025.md). The subject in the first and
last clause of the verse is Jahve. Bertheau therefore assumes that He is
also the subject of the intermediate sentence: "and God slew their young
men in the sanctuary;" but this can hardly be correct. As in the
expansion of the last clause, "he gave everything into his hand," which
follows in [Ch2 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#018.md), not Jahve but
the king of Babylon is the subject; so also in the expansion of the
first clause, which וגו ויּהרג introduces, the king of the Chaldeans is
the subject, as most commentators have rightly recognised. By מקדּשׁם
בּבית the judgment is brought into definite relationship to the crime:
because they had profaned the sanctuary by idolatry ([Ch2
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#014).md), they themselves were slain in
the sanctuary. On נתן ב הכּל, cf. [Jer
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md); [Jer
32:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003.md). הכּל includes things and
persons, and is specialized in [Ch2
36:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#018.md).

[2 Chronicles 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 36:18</span></span>

All the vessels of the house of God, the treasures of the temple, and of
the palace of the king and of the princes, all he brought to Babylon.

[2 Chronicles 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 36:19</span></span>

They burnt the house of God; they pulled down the walls of Jerusalem,
and burnt all the palaces of the city with fire, and all the costly
vessels were devoted to destruction. On להשׁחית, cf. [Ch2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#012.md).

[2 Chronicles 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 36:20</span></span>

He who remained from the sword, i.e., who had not been slain by the
sword, had not fallen and died in war, Nebuchadnezzar carried away to
Babylon into captivity; so that they became servants to him and to his
sons, as Jeremiah ([Jer 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007).md)
prophesied, until the rise of the kingdom of the Persians. These last
words also are an historical interpretation of the prophecy, [Jer
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md). All this was done ([Ch2
36:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021).md) to fulfil (מלּאת instead of
מלּא, as in [Ch1 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#005).md), that the word
of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, he having
prophesied ([Jer 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md)., [Ch2
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#010).md) the seventy years' duration of
Judah's desolation and the Babylonian captivity, while the king and
people had not regarded his words ([Ch2
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#012).md). This period, which according
to [Ch2 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#020.md) came to an end with the
rise of the kingdom of the Persians, is characterized by the clause וגו
רצתה עד as a time of expiation of the wrong which had been done the land
by the non-observance of the sabbath-years, upon the basis of the
threatening ([Lev 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034).md), in which the
wasting of the land during the dispersion of the unrepentant people
among the heathen was represented as a compensation for the neglected
sabbaths. From this passage in the law the words are taken, to show how
the Lord had inflicted the punishment with which the disobedient people
had been threatened as early as in the time of Moses. רצתה עד is not to
be translated, "until the land had made up its years of rest;" that
signification רצה has not; but, "until the land had enjoyed its
sabbath-years," i.e., until it had enjoyed the rest of which it had been
deprived by the non-observance of the sabbaths and the sabbath-years,
contrary to the will of its Creator; see on [Lev
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md). That this is the thought is
placed beyond doubt by the succeeding circumstantial clause, taken word
for word from [Lev 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md) : "all days
(i.e., the whole time) of its desolation did it hold it" (שׁבתה, it kept
sabbath). "To make full the seventy years;" which Jeremiah, ll. cc., had
prophesied.

This connecting of Jeremiah's prophecy with the declaration in [Lev
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md) does not justify us in supposing
that the celebration of the sabbath-year had been neglected seventy
times, or that for a period of 490 years the sabbath-year had not been
observed. Bertheau, holding this view, fixes upon 1000 b.c., i.e., the
time of Solomon, or, as we cannot expect any very great chronological
exactitude, the beginning of the kingly government in Israel, as the
period after which the rest-years ceased to be regarded. He is further
of opinion that [Ch2 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#018.md) harmonizes
with this view; according to which passage the passover was not
celebrated in accordance with the prescription of the law until the end
of the period of the judges. According to this chronological
calculation, the beginning of this neglect of the observance of the
sabbath-year would fall in the beginning of the judgeship of Samuel.

(Note: The seventy years' exile began in the fourth year of Jehoiakim,
i.e., in the year 606 b.c., or 369 years after the division of the
kingdom; see the Chronol. Tables at 1 Kings 12 (ii. 3, S. 141), to which
the eighty years of the reigns of David and Solomon, and the time of
Saul and Samuel, must be added to make up the 490 years (see the
comment. on Judges).)

But this is itself unlikely; and still more unlikely is it, that in the
time of the judges the sabbath-year had been regularly observed until
Samuel; and that during the reigns of the kings David, Solomon,
Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah, this celebration remained wholly in
abeyance. But even apart from that, the words, that the land, to make
full the seventy years prophesied by Jeremiah, kept the whole time of
the desolation holy, or enjoyed a sabbath rest such as Moses had
proclaimed in [Lev 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md), do not
necessarily involve that the land had been deprived of its sabbath rest
seventy times in succession, or during a period of 490 years, by the sin
of the people. The connection between the prophecy of Jeremiah and the
provision of the law is to be understood theologically, and does not
purport to be calculated chronologically. The thought is this: By the
infliction of the punishment threatened against the transgressors of the
law by the carrying of the people away captive into Babylon, the land
will obtain the rest which the sinful people had deprived it of by their
neglect of the sabbath observance commanded them. By causing it to
remain uncultivated for seventy years, God gave to the land a time of
rest and refreshment, which its inhabitants, so long as they possessed
it, had not given it. But that does not mean that the time for which
this rest was granted corresponded to the number of the sabbath-years
which had not been observed. From these theological reflections we
cannot calculate how often in the course of the centuries, from the time
of Joshua onwards till the exile, the sabbath-year had not been
observed; and still less the time after which the observation of the
sabbath-year was continuously neglected. The passage [Ch2
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#008.md) has no bearing on this question,
because it neither states that the passover had been held according to
the precepts of the law till towards the end of the time of the judges,
nor that it was no longer celebrated in accordance with the precept from
that time until Josiah; it only contains the thought that such a
passover as that in Josiah's reign had not been held since the time of
the judges: see on the passage.

[2 Chronicles 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 36:22</span></span>

To point out still further how exactly God had fulfilled His word by the
mouth of the prophet Jeremiah, it is in conclusion briefly mentioned
that God, in the first year of Coresh king of Persia, stirred up the
spirit of this king to cause a command to go forth in all his kingdom,
that Jahve, the God of heaven, who had given him all the kingdoms of the
earth, had commanded him to build again His temple in Jerusalem, and
that whoever belonged to the people of God might go up to Jerusalem.
With this comforting prospect for the future, the author of the
Chronicle closes his consideration of the prae-exilic history of the
people of God without completely communicating the contents of the royal
edict of Cyrus, since he purposed to narrate the history of the
restoration of Judah to their own land in a separate work. This we have
in the book of Ezra, which commences by giving us the whole of the edict
of Cyrus the king of the Persians ([Ezr
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md), and then narrates the return
of a great part of the people to Jerusalem and Judah, the rebuilding of
the temple, and the re-settlement in the land of their fathers of those
who had returned.
