[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 25:0</span></span>

Prayer for Gracious Protection and Guidance

A question similar to the question, Who may ascend the mountain of
Jahve? which [Psa 24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md) propounded,
is thrown out by Ps 25, Who is he that feareth Jahve? in order to answer
it in great and glorious promises. It is calmly confident prayer for
help against one's foes, and for God's instructing, pardoning, and
leading grace. It is without any definite background indicating the
history of the times in which it was composed; and also without any
clearly marked traits of individuality. But it is one of the nine
alphabetical Psalms of the whole collection, and the companion to Ps 34,
to which it corresponds even in many peculiarities of the acrostic
structure. For both Psalms have no ו strophe; they are parallel both as
to sound and meaning in the beginnings of the מ, ע, and the first פ
strophes; and both Psalms, after having gone through the alphabet, have
a פ strophe added as the concluding one, whose beginning and contents
are closely related. This homogeneousness points to one common author.
We see nothing in the alphabetical arrangement at least, which even here
as in Ps 9-10 is handled very freely and not fully carried out, to
hinder us from regarding David as this author. But, in connection with
the general ethical and religious character of the Psalm, it is wanting
in positive proofs of this. In its universal character and harmony with
the plan of redemption Ps 25 coincides with many post-exilic Psalms. It
contains nothing but what is common to the believing consciousness of
the church in every age; nothing specifically belonging to the Old
Testament and Israelitish, hence Theodoret says: ἁρμόζει μάλιστα τοῖς ἐξ
ἐθνῶν κεκλημένοις. The introits for the second and third Quadragesima
Sundays are taken from [Psa 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#006.md) and
[Psa 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015.md); hence these Sundays are
called Reminiscere and Oculi. Paul Gerhardt's hymn "Nach dir, o Herr,
verlanget mich" is a beautiful poetical rendering of this Psalm.

[Psalms 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 25:1</span></span>

The Psalm begins, like [Psa 16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md);
[Psa 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md), with a monostich. [Psa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md) is the ב strophe, אלהי (unless
one is disposed to read בך אלהי according to the position of the words
in [Psa 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002).md), after the manner of the
interjections in the tragedians, e.g., oo'moi, not being reckoned as
belonging to the verse (J. D. Kצhler). In need of help and full of
longing for deliverance he raises his soul, drawn away from earthly
desires, to Jahve ([Psa 86:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#004.md); [Psa
143:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#008).md), the God who alone can grant
him that which shall truly satisfy his need. His ego, which has the soul
within itself, directs his soul upwards to Him whom he calls אלהי,
because in believing confidence he clings to Him and is united with Him.
The two אל declare what Jahve is not to allow him to experience, just as
in [Psa 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002.md), [Psa
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#018.md). According to [Psa
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#019.md), [Psa
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#020.md); [Psa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017.md), it is safer to construe לי with
יעלצוּ (cf. [Psa 71:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#010).md), as also in
[Psa 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md); [Psa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#002.md), [Mic
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008.md), although it would be possible to
construe it with אויבי (cf. [Psa
144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002).md). In [Psa
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#003.md) the confident expectation of the
individual is generalised.

[Psalms 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 25:3</span></span>

That wherewith the praying one comforts himself is no peculiar personal
prerogative, but the certain, joyous prospect of all believers: ἡ ἐλπίς
ου ̓ καταισχύνει, [Rom 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005.md). These are
called קויך (קוה participle to קוּה ot elp, just as דּבר is the
participle to דּבּר). Hope is the eye of faith which looks forth clear
and fixedly into the future. With those who hope in Jahve, who do not
allow themselves to be in any way disconcerted respecting Him, are
contrasted those who act treacherously towards Him ([Psa
119:158](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#158.md), Aq., Symm., Theodot. οἱ
ἀποστατοῦντες), and that ריקם, i.e. - and it can only mean this-from
vain and worthless pretexts, and therefore from wanton
unconscientiousness.

[Psalms 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 25:4</span></span>

Recognising the infamy of such black ingratitude, he prays for
instruction as to the ways which he must take according to the precepts
of God ([Psa 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#022).md). The will of God,
it is true, lies before us in God's written word, but the expounder
required for the right understanding of that word is God Himself. He
prays Him for knowledge; but in order to make what he knows a perfect
and living reality, he still further needs the grace of God, viz., both
His enlightening and also His guiding grace.

[Psalms 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 25:5</span></span>

His truth is the lasting and self-verifying fact of His revelation of
grace. To penetrate into this truth and to walk in it ([Psa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#003.md); [Psa
86:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#011).md) without God, is a contradiction
in its very self. Therefore the psalmist prays, as in [Psa
119:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#035.md), οδήγησόν με ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ σου
(lxx Cod. Alex.; whereas Cod. Vat. ἐπὶ τὴν..., cf. [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013).md). He prays thus, for his
salvation comes from Jahve, yea Jahve is his salvation. He does not hope
for this or that, but for Him, all the day, i.e., unceasingly,

(Note: Hupfeld thinks the accentuation inappropriate; the first half of
the verse, however, really extends to ישׁעי, and consists of two parts,
of which the second is the confirmation of the first: the second half
contains a relatively new thought. The sequence of the accents: Rebia
magnum, Athnach, therefore fully accords with the matter.)

for everything worth hoping for, everything that can satisfy the longing
of the soul, is shut up in Him. All mercy or grace, however, which
proceeds from Him, has its foundation in His compassion and
condescension.

[Psalms 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 25:6</span></span>

The supplicatory reminiscere means, may God never forget to exercise His
pity and grace towards him, which are (as the plurals imply) so rich and
superabundant. The ground on which the prayer is based is introduced
with כּי (nam, or even quoniam). God's compassion and grace are as old
in their operation and efficacy as man's feebleness and sin; in their
counsels they are eternal, and therefore have also in themselves the
pledge of eternal duration ([Psa
100:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#005.md); [Psa
103:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#017).md).

[Psalms 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 25:7</span></span>

May Jahve not remember the faults of his youth (חטּאות), into which lust
and thoughtlessness have precipitated him, nor the transgressions
(פּשׁעים), by which even in maturer and more thoughtful years he has
turned the grace of God into licentiousness and broken off his
fellowship with Him (פּשׁע בּ, of defection); but may He, on the
contrary, turn His remembrance to him (זכר ל as in [Psa
136:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#023).md) in accordance with His grace
or loving-kindness, which אתּה challenges as being the form of
self-attestation most closely corresponding to the nature of God. Memor
esto quidem mei, observes Augustine, non secundum iram, qua ego dignus
sum, sed secundum misericordiam tuam, quae te digna est. For God is
טּוב, which is really equivalent to saying, He is ἀγάπη. The next
distich shows that טוּב is intended here of God's goodness, and not, as
e.g., in [Neh 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#035.md), of His abundance
of possessions.

[Psalms 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 25:8</span></span>

The בּ with הורה denotes the way, i.e., the right way ([Job
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007).md), as the sphere and subject of
the instruction, as in [Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md), [Pro
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#011.md); [Job
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011.md). God condescends to sinners in
order to teach them the way that leads to life, for He is טוב־וישׂר;
well-doing is His delight, and, if His anger be not provoked ([Psa
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027).md), He has only the sincerest good
intention in what He does.

[Psalms 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 25:9</span></span>

The shortened form of the future stands here, according to Ges. ֗128, 2,
rem., instead of the full form (which, viz., ידרך, is perhaps meant);
for the connection which treats of general facts, does not admit of its
being taken as optative. The ב (cf. [Psa
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005.md), [Psa
107:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007.md); [Psa
119:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#035).md) denotes the sphere of the
guidance. משׁפּט is the right so far as it is traversed, i.e., practised
or carried out. In this course of right He leads the ענוים, and teaches
them the way that is pleasing to Himself. ענוים is the one word for the
gentle, mansueti, and the humble, modesti. Jerome uses these words
alternately in [Psa 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md) and [Psa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md); but the poet designedly repeats
the one word - the cardinal virtue of ענוה - here with the
preponderating notion of lowliness. Upon the self-righteous and
self-sufficient He would be obliged to force Himself even against their
will. He wants disciples eager to learn; and how richly He rewards those
who guard what they have learnt!

[Psalms 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 25:10</span></span>

The paths intended, are those which He takes with men in accordance with
His revealed will and counsel. These paths are חסד loving-kindness,
mercy, or grace, for the salvation of men is their goal, and אמת truth,
for they give proof at every step of the certainty of His promises. But
only they who keep His covenant and His testimonies faithfully and
obediently shall share in this mercy and truth. To the psalmist the name
of Jahve, which unfolds itself in mercy and truth, is precious. Upon it
he bases the prayer that follows.

[Psalms 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 25:11</span></span>

The perf. consec. is attached to the יהי, which is, according to the
sense, implied in למען שׁמך, just as in other instances it follows
adverbial members of a clause, placed first for the sake of emphasis,
when those members have reference to the future, Ges. ֗126, rem. 1.
Separate and manifold sins ([Psa 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007).md)
are all comprehended in עון, which is in other instances also the
collective word for the corruption and the guilt of sin. כּי gives the
ground of the need and urgency of the petition. A great and multiform
load of sin lies upon him, but the name of God, i.e., His nature that
has become manifest in His mercy and truth, permits him to ask and to
hope for forgiveness, not for the sake of anything whatever that he has
done, but just for the sake of this name ([Jer
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007.md); [Isa
43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025).md). How happy therefore is he who
fears God, in this matter!

[Psalms 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 25:12</span></span>

The question: quisnam est vir, which resembles [Psa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013.md); [Psa
107:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#043.md); [Isa
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md), is only propounded in order to
draw attention to the person who bears the character described, and then
to state what such an one has to expect. In prose we should have a
relative antecedent clause instead, viz., qui (quisquis) talis est qui
Dominum vereatur.

(Note: The verb ver-eri, which signifies "to guard one's self, defend
one's self from anything" according to its radical notion, has nothing
to do with ירא (ורא).)

The attributive יבהר, (viam) quam eligat (cf. [Isa
48:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#017).md), might also be referred to God:
in which He takes delight (lxx); but parallels like [Psa
119:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#030.md), [Psa
119:173](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#173.md), favour the rendering: which
he should choose. Among all the blessings which fall to the lot of him
who fears God, the first place is given to this, that God raises him
above the vacillation and hesitancy of human opinion.

[Psalms 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 25:13</span></span>

The verb לין (לוּן), probably equivalent to ליל (from ליל) signifies to
tarry the night, to lodge. Good, i.e., inward and outward prosperity, is
like the place where such an one turns in and finds shelter and
protection. And in his posterity will be fulfilled what was promised to
the patriarchs and to the people delivered from Egypt, viz., possession
of the land, or as this promise runs in the New Testament, of the earth,
[Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md) (cf. [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011).md), [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 25:14</span></span>

The lxx renders סוד, κραταίωμα, as though it were equivalent to יסוד.
The reciprocal נוסד, [Psa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md) (which
see), leads one to the right primary signification. Starting from the
primary meaning of the root סד, "to be or to make tight, firm,
compressed," סוד signifies a being closely pressed together for the
purpose of secret communication and converse, confidential communion or
being together, [Psa 89:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#008.md); [Psa
111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001) (Symm. ὁμιλία.md), then the
confidential communication itself, [Psa
55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015.md), a secret (Aquila ἀπόῤῥητον,
Theod. μυστήριον). So here: He opens his mind without any reserve,
speaks confidentially with those who fear Him; cf. the derivative
passage [Pro 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032.md), and an example of
the thing itself in [Gen 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017.md). In
[Psa 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md) the infinitive with ל,
according to Ges. ֗132, rem. 1, as in [Isa
38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020.md), is an expression for the fut.
periphrast.: faedus suum notum facturus est iis; the position of the
words is like [Dan 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#016.md), [Dan
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#018.md); [Dan
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#015.md). הודיע is used of the imparting
of not merely intellectual, but experimental knowledge. Hitzig renders
it differently, viz., to enlighten them. But the Hiph. is not intended
to be used thus absolutely even in [Sa2
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#021.md). בּריתו is the object; it is
intended of the rich and deep and glorious character of the covenant
revelation. The poet has now on all sides confirmed the truth, that
every good gift comes down from above, from the God of salvation; and he
returns to the thought from which he started.

[Psalms 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 25:15</span></span>

He who keeps his eyes constantly directed towards God ([Psa
141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008.md); [Psa
123:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001).md), is continually in a praying
mood, which cannot remain unanswered. תּמיד corresponds to ἀδιαλείπτως
in [Th1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017.md). The aim of this constant
looking upwards to God, in this instance, is deliverance out of the
enemy's net. He can and will pull him out ([Psa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005).md) of the net of complicated
circumstances into which he has been ensnared without any fault of his
own.

[Psalms 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 25:16</span></span>

The rendering "regard me," so far as פּנה אל means God's observant and
sympathising turning to any one (lxx ἐπιβλέπειν), corresponds to [Psa
86:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#016.md); [Lev
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#009.md). For this he longs, for men treat
him as a stranger and refuse to have anything to do with him. יחיד is
the only one of his kind, one who has no companion, therefore the
isolated one. The recurrence of the same sounds עני אני is designedly
not avoided. To whom could he, the isolated one, pour forth his
affliction, to whom could he unveil his inmost thoughts and feelings? to
God alone! To Him he can bring all his complaints, to Him he can also
again and again always make supplication.

[Psalms 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 25:17</span></span>

The Hiph. הרחיב signifies to make broad, and as a transitive
denominative applied to the mind and heart: to make a broad space = to
expand one's self (cf. as to the idea, [Lam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013.md), "great as the sea is thy
misfortune"), lxx ἐπληθύνθησαν, perhaps originally it was ἐπλατηύνθησαν.
Accordingly הרחיבוּ is admissible so far as language is concerned; but
since it gives only a poor antithesis to צרות it is to be suspected. The
original text undoubtedly was הרחיב וממצוקותי (הרחיב, as in [Psa
77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002.md), or הרחיב, as e.g., in [Kg2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#006).md): the straits of my heart do Thou
enlarge (cf. [Psa 119:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032.md); [Co2
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011).md) and bring me out of my
distresses (Hitzig and others).

[Psalms 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 25:18</span></span>

The falling away of the ק is made up for by a double ר strophe. Even the
lxx has ἴδε twice over. The seeing that is prayed for, is in both
instances a seeing into his condition, with which is conjoined the
notion of interposing on his behalf, though the way and manner thereof
is left to God. נשׂא ל, with the object in the dative instead of the
accusative (tollere peccata), signifies to bestow a taking away, i.e.,
forgiveness, upon any one (synon. סלח ל). It is pleasing to the New
Testament consciousness that God's vengeance is not expressly invoked
upon his enemies. כּי is an expansive quod as in [Gen
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004.md). שׂנאת חמס with an attributive
genitive is hatred, which springs from injustice and ends in injustice.

[Psalms 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 25:20</span></span>

He entreats for preservation and deliverance from God; and that He may
not permit his hope to be disappointed (אל־אבושׁ, cf. [Ch1
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#013.md), instead of אל־אבושׁה which is
usual in other instances). This his hope rests indeed in Him: he has
taken refuge in Him and therefore He cannot forsake him, He cannot let
him be destroyed.

[Psalms 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 25:21</span></span>

Devoutness that fills the whole man, that is not merely half-hearted and
hypocritical, is called תּם; and uprightness that follows the will of
God without any bypaths and forbidden ways is called ישׁר. These two
radical virtues (cf. [Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001).md) he
desires to have as his guardians on his way which is perilous not only
by reason of outward foes, but also on account of his own sinfulness.
These custodians are not to let him pass out of their sight, lest he
should be taken away from them (cf. [Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md); [Pro
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#028).md). He can claim this for himself,
for the cynosure of his hope is God, from whom proceed תם and ישׁר like
good angels.

[Psalms 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 25:22</span></span>

His experience is not singular, but the enmity of the world and sin
bring all who belong to the people of God into straits just as they have
him. And the need of the individual will not cease until the need of the
whole undergoes a radical remedy. Hence the intercessory prayer of this
meagre closing distich, whose connection with what precedes is not in
this instance so close as in Ps 34:23. It looks as though it was only
added when Ps 25 came to be used in public worship; and the change of
the name of God favours this view. Both Psalms close with a פ in excess
of the alphabet. Perhaps the first פ represents the π, and the second
the φ; for [Psa 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016.md); [Psa
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#017.md) follow words ending in a
consonant, and [Psa 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#022.md); 34:23,
words ending in a vowel. Or is it a propensity for giving a special
representation of the final letters, just as these are sometimes
represented, though not always perfectly, at the close of the hymns of
the synagogue (pijutim)?
