### [Genesis Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 7:1</span></span>

[Gen 7:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001.md)

When the ark was built, and the period of grace ([Gen
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003).md) had passed, Noah received
instructions from Jehovah to enter the ark with his family, and with the
animals, viz., seven of every kind of clean animals, and two of the
unclean; and was informed that within seven days God would cause it to
rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights. The date of the flood
is then given ([Gen 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#006).md): "Noah was
six hundred years old, and the flood was (namely) water upon the earth;"
and the execution of the divine command is recorded in [Gen
7:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#007.md). There follows next the account
of the bursting forth of the flood, the date being given with still
greater minuteness; and the entrance of the men and animals into the ark
is again described as being fully accomplished ([Gen
7:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#010).md). - The fact that in the
command to enter the ark a distinction is now made between clean and
unclean animals, seven of the former being ordered to be taken, - i.e.,
three pair and a single one, probably a male for sacrifice-is no more a
proof of different authorship, or of the fusion of two accounts, than
the interchange of the names Jehovah and Elohim. For the distinction
between clean and unclean animals did not originate with Moses, but was
confirmed by him as a long established custom, in harmony with the law.
It reached back to the very earliest times, and arose from a certain
innate feeling of the human mind, when undisturbed by unnatural and
ungodly influences, which detects types of sin and corruption in many
animals, and instinctively recoils from them (see my biblische
Archeologie ii. p. 20). That the variations in the names of God furnish
no criterion by which to detect different documents, is evident enough
from the fact, that in [Gen 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001.md) it is
Jehovah who commands Noah to enter the ark, and in [Gen
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#004.md) Noah does as Elohim had commanded,
whilst in [Gen 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#016.md), in two successive
clauses, Elohim alternates with Jehovah-the animals entering the ark at
the command of Elohim, and Jehovah shutting Noah in. With regard to the
entrance of the animals into the ark, it is worthy of notice, that in
[Gen 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#009.md) and [Gen
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#015.md) it is stated that "they came two
and two," and in [Gen 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#016.md) that "the
coming ones came male and female of all flesh." In this expression "they
came" it is clearly intimated, that the animals collected about Noah and
were taken into the ark, without his having to exert himself to collect
them, and that they did so in consequence of an instinct produced by
God, like that which frequently leads animals to scent and try to flee
from dangers, of which man has no presentiment. The time when the flood
commenced is said to have been the 600th year of Noah's life, on the
17th day of the second month ([Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011).md). The months must be reckoned,
not according to the Mosaic ecclesiastical year, which commenced in the
spring, but according to the natural of civil year, which commenced in
the autumn at the beginning of sowing time, or the autumnal equinox; so
that the flood would be pouring upon the earth in October and November.
"The same day were all the fountains of the great deep (תּהום the
unfathomable ocean) broken up, and the sluices (windows, lattices) of
heaven opened, and there was (happened, came) pouring rain (גּשׁם in
distinction from טטר) upon the earth 40 days and 40 nights." Thus the
flood was produced by the bursting forth of fountains hidden within the
earth, which drove seas and rivers above their banks, and by rain which
continued incessantly for 40 days and 40 nights.

[Gen 7:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#013.md)

"In the self-same day had Noah...entered into the ark:" בּא, pluperfect
"had come," not came, which would require יבא. The idea is not that
Noah, with his family and all the animals, entered the ark on the very
day on which the rain began, but that on that day he had entered, had
completed the entering, which occupied the seven days between the giving
of the command ([Gen 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#004).md) and the
commencement of the flood ([Gen 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#010).md).

[Genesis 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 7:17</span></span>

[Gen 7:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#017.md) contain a description of
the flood: how the water increased more and more, till it was 15 cubits
above all the lofty mountains of the earth, and how, on the one hand, it
raised the ark above the earth and above the mountains, and, on the
other, destroyed every living being upon the dry land, from man to
cattle, creeping things, and birds. "The description is simple and
majestic; the almighty judgment of God, and the love manifest in the
midst of the wrath, hold the historian fast. The tautologies depict the
fearful monotony of the immeasurable expanse of water: omnia pontus
erant et deerant litera ponto." The words of [Gen
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#017), "and the flood was (came.md) upon
the earth for forty days," relate to the 40 days' rain combined with the
bursting forth of the foundations beneath the earth. By these the water
was eventually raised to the height given, at which it remained 150 days
([Gen 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#024).md). But if the water covered
"all the high hills under the whole heaven," this clearly indicates the
universality of the flood. The statement, indeed, that it rose 15 cubits
above the mountains, is probably founded upon the fact, that the ark
drew 15 feet of water, and that when the waters subsided, it rested upon
the top of Ararat, from which the conclusion would very naturally be
drawn as to the greatest height attained. Now as Ararat, according to
the measurement of Perrot, is only 16,254 feet high, whereas the
loftiest peaks of the Himalaya and Cordilleras are as much as 26,843,
the submersion of these mountains has been thought impossible, and the
statement in [Gen 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#019.md) has been
regarded as a rhetorical expression, like [Deu
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025.md) and [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md), which is not of universal
application. But even if those peaks, which are higher than Ararat, were
not covered by water, we cannot therefore pronounce the flood merely
partial in its extent, but must regard it as universal, as extending
over every part of the world, since the few peaks uncovered would not
only sink into vanishing points in comparison with the surface covered,
but would form an exception not worth mentioning, for the simple reason
that no living beings could exist upon these mountains, covered with
perpetual snow and ice; so that everything that lived upon the dry land,
in whose nostrils there was a breath of life, would inevitably die, and,
with the exception of those shut up in the ark, neither man nor beast
would be able to rescue itself, and escape destruction. A flood which
rose 15 cubits above the top of Ararat could not remain partial, if it
only continued a few days, to say nothing of the fact that the water was
rising for 40 days, and remained at the highest elevation for 150 days.
To speak of such a flood as partial is absurd, even if it broke out at
only one spot, it would spread over the earth from one end to the other,
and reach everywhere to the same elevation. However impossible,
therefore, scientific men may declare it to be for them to conceive of a
universal flood of such a height and duration in accordance with the
known laws of nature, this inability on their part does not justify any
one in questioning the possibility of such an event being produced by
the omnipotence of God. It has been justly remarked, too, that the
proportion of such a quantity of water to the entire mass of the earth,
in relation to which the mountains are but like the scratches of a
needle on a globe, is no greater than that of a profuse perspiration to
the body of a man. And to this must be added, that, apart from the
legend of a flood, which is found in nearly every nation, the earth
presents unquestionable traces of submersion in the fossil remains of
animals and plants, which are found upon the Cordilleras and Himalaya
even beyond the limit of perpetual snow.

(Note: The geological facts which testify to the submersion of the
entire globe are collected in Buckland's reliquiae diluv., Schubert's
Gesch. der Natur, and C. v. Raumer's Geography, and are of such
importance that even Cuvier acknowledged "Je pense donc, avec MM. Deluc
et Dolomieu, que s'il y a quelque chose de constat en gologie; c'est que
la surface de notre globe a t victime d'une grande et subite rvolution,
dont la date ne peut remonter beaucoup au del de cinq ou six mille ans"
(Discours sur les rvol. de la surface du globe, p. 190, ed. 6). The
latest phase of geology, however, denies that these facts furnish any
testimony to the historical character of the flood, and substitutes the
hypothesis of a submersion of the entire globe before the creation of
man: 1. because the animals found are very different from those at
present in existence; and 2. because no certain traces have hitherto
been found of fossil human bones. We have already shown that there is no
force in these arguments. Vid., Keerl, pp. 489ff.)

In [Gen 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#023.md), instead of ויּמּח
(imperf. Niphal) read ויּמח (imperf. Kal): "and He (Jehovah) destroyed
every existing thing," as He had said in [Gen
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#004.md).
