[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 10:1</span></span>

Visit of the Queen of Saba (cf. [Ch2
9:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001).md). - When the fame of Solomon's
great wisdom came to the ears of the queen of Saba, probably through the
Ophir voyages, she undertook a journey to Jerusalem, to convince herself
of the truth of the report which had reached her, by putting it to the
test by means of enigmas. שׁבא, Σαβά, is not Ethiopia or Mero, as
Josephus (Ant. viii. 6, 5), who confounds שׁבא with סבא, and the
Abyssinian Christians suppose (vid., Ludolfi hist. Aeth. ii. 3), but the
kingdom of the Sabaeans, who were celebrated for their trade in incense,
gold, and precious stones, and who dwelt in Arabia Felix, with the
capital Saba, or the Μαριάβα of the Greeks. This queen, who is called
Balkis in the Arabian legend (cf. Koran, Sur. 27, and Pococke, Specim.
hist. Arab. p. 60), heard the fame of Solomon יהוה לשׁם; i.e., not "at
the naming of the name of Jehovah" (Bttcher), nor "in respect of the
glory of the Lord, with regard to that which Solomon had instituted for
the glory of the Lord" (Thenius); nor even "serving to the glorification
of God" (de Wette and Maurer); but literally, "belonging to the name of
the Lord:" in other words, the fame which Solomon had acquired through
the name of the Lord, or through the fact that the Lord had so glorified
Himself in him (Ewald and Dietrich in Ges. Lex. s.v. ל). "She came to
try him with riddles," i.e., to put his wisdom to the test by carrying
on a conversation with him in riddles. The love of the Arabs for
riddles, and their superiority in this jeu d'esprit, is sufficiently
well known from the immense extent to which the Arabic literature
abounds in Mashals. We have only to think of the large collections of
proverbs made by Ali ben Abi Taleb and Meidani, or the Makamen of
Hariri, which have been made accessible to all by F. Rckert's masterly
translation into German, and which are distinguished by an amazing
fulness of word-play and riddles. חידה, a riddle, is a pointed saying
which merely hints at the deeper truth and leaves it to be guessed.

[Kg1 10:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002.md)

As the queen of a wealthy country, she came with a very large retinue.
חיל does not mean a military force or an armed escort (Thenius), but
riches, property; namely, her numerous retinue of men (עבדים, [Kg1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013).md), and camels laden with valuable
treasures. The words יקרה...גּמלּים are an explanatory circumstantial
clause, both here and also in the Chronicles, where the cop. Vav stands
before גּמלּים (cf. Ewald, 341, a., b.). "And spake to Solomon all that
she had upon her heart," i.e., in this connection, whatever riddles she
had it in her mind to lay before him; "and Solomon told her all her
sayings," i.e., was able to solve all her riddles. There is no ground
for thinking of sayings of a religious nature, as the earlier
commentators supposed, but simply of sayings the meaning of which was
concealed, and the understanding of which indicated very deep wisdom.

[Kg1 10:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#004.md)

She saw הבּית, i.e., Solomon's palace, not the temple, and "the food of
his table," i.e., both the great variety of food that was placed upon
the king's table ([Kg1 5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#002).md), and
also the costly furniture of the table ([Kg1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021).md), and "the seat of his retainers
and the standing of his servants," i.e., the places in the palace
assigned to the ministers and servants of the king, which were contrived
with wisdom and arranged in a splendid manner. עבדים are the chief
officers of the king, viz., ministers, counsellors, and aides de camp;
משׁרתים, the court servants; מושׁב, the rooms of the courtiers in
attendance; מעמד, the standing-place, i.e., the rooms of the inferior
servants, "and their clothing," which they received from the king; and
משׁקיו, not his cup-bearers (lxx, Vulg.), but as in [Gen
40:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#021.md), the drink, i.e., probably the
whole of the drinking arrangements; ועלתו, and his ascent, by which he
was accustomed to go into the house of Jehovah. עלה does not mean
burnt-offering here, as the older translators have rendered it, but
ascent, as in [Eze 40:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#026.md), and as the
Chronicles have correctly explained it by עליּתו. For burnt-offering is
not to be thought of in this connection, because the queen had nothing
to see or to be astonished at in the presentation of such an offering.
עלתו is most likely "the king's outer entrance" into the temple,
mentioned in [Kg2 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018.md); and the
passage before us would lead us to suppose that this was a work of art,
or an artistic arrangement. וגו היה ולא, "and there was no more spirit
in her:" she was beside herself with amazement, as in [Jos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md); [Jos
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#011.md).

[Kg1 10:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#006.md)

She then said with astonishment to Solomon, that of what her eyes now
saw she had not heard the half, through the report which had reached her
of his affairs and of his wisdom, and which had hitherto appeared
incredible to her; and not only congratulated his servants, who stood
continually near him and could hear his wisdom, but also praised Jehovah
his God, that out of His eternal love to His people Israel He had given
them a king to do justice and righteousness. The earlier theologians
inferred from this praising of Jehovah, which involved faith in the true
God, when taken in connection with [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042.md), that this queen had been
converted to the true God, and conversed with Solomon on religious
matters. But, as we have already observed at [Kg1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#007.md), an acknowledgment of Jehovah as
the God of Israel was reconcilable with polytheism. And the fact that
nothing is said about her offering sacrifice in the temple, shows that
the conversion of the queen is not to be thought of here.

[Kg1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010.md)

She thereupon presented to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold
(more than three million thalers nearly half a million sterling -
Tr.\]), and a very large quantity of spices and precious stones. The
בּשׂמים probably included the genuine balsam of Arabia, even if בּשׂם
was not the specific name of the genuine balsam. "There never more came
so much of such spices of Jerusalem." Instead of לרב עוד...בּא לא we
find in the Chronicles, [Kg1 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#009.md),
simply היה לא, "there was nothing like this balsam," which conveys the
same meaning though expressed more indefinitely, since ההוּא ecni
כּבּשׂם points back to the preceding words, "balsam (spices) in great
quantity."

(Note: It was this which gave rise to the legend in Josephus (Ant. viii.
6, 6), that it was through this queen that the root of the true balsam
(Opobalsamum), which was afterwards cultivated in gardens at Jericho and
Engedi, was first of all brought to Palestine (cf. Movers, Phnizier, ii.
3, p. 226ff.).

[Kg1 10:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011.md)

The allusion to these costly presents leads the historian to introduce
the remark here, that the Ophir fleet also brought, in addition to gold,
a large quantity of Algummim wood (see at [Kg1
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028).md) and precious stones. Of this
wood Solomon had מסעד or מסלּות made for the temple and palace. מסעד,
from סעד, signifies a support, and מסלּה may be a later form for סלּם, a
flight of steps or a staircase, so that we should have to think of steps
with bannisters. This explanation is at any rate a safer one than that
of "divans" (Thenius), which would have been quite out of place in the
temple, or "narrow pannelled stripes on the floor" (Bertheau), which
cannot in the smallest degree be deduced from מסעד, or "support =
moveables, viz., tables, benches, footstools, boxes, and drawers"
(Bttcher), which neither harmonizes with the temple, where there was no
such furniture, nor with the מסלּות of the Chronicles. "And guitars and
harps for the singers," probably for the temple singers. כּנּור and נבל
are string instruments; the former resembling our guitar rather than the
harp, the strings being carried over the sounding-board upon a bridge,
the latter being of a pitcher shape without any sounding bridge, as in
the case of the harps.

[Kg1 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013.md)

Solomon gave the queen of Saba all that she wished and asked for, beside
what he gave her "according to the hand," i.e., the might, of the king;
that is to say, in addition to the presents answering to his might and
his wealth, which he was obliged to give as a king, according to the
Oriental custom. In the Chronicles ([Kg1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012).md) we find "beside that which she
had brought (הביאה) to the king," which is an abbreviated expression for
"beside that which he gave her in return for what she had brought to
him," or beside the return presents corresponding to her gifts to him,
as it has been already correctly paraphrased by the Targum.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 10:14</span></span>

Solomon's Wealth and the Use He Made of It (cf. [Ch2
9:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#013).md). - [Kg1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md). The gold which Solomon received
in one year amounted to 666 talents, - more than seventeen million
thalers (two million and a half sterling - Tr.). 666 is evidently a
round number founded upon an approximative valuation. אחת בּשׁנה is
rendered in the Vulg. per annos singulos; but this is hardly correct, as
the Ophir fleet, the produce of which is at any rate included, did not
arrive every year, but once in three years. Thenius is wrong in
supposing that this revenue merely applies to the direct taxes levied
upon the Israelites. It includes all the branches of Solomon's revenue,
whether derived from his commerce by sea and land (cf. [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md), [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029).md) or from the royal domains ([Ch1
27:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#026).md), or received in the form of
presents from foreign princes, who either visited him like the queen of
Saba or sent ambassadors to him ([Kg1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023.md), [Kg1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#024).md), excepting the duties and
tribute from conquered kings, which are specially mentioned in [Kg1
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015.md). הת מאנשׁי לבד, beside what came
in (לשׁלמה בּא) from the travelling traders and the commerce of the
merchants, and from all the kings, etc. התּרים אנשׁי (a combination
resembling our merchantmen; cf. Ewald, 287, e., p. 721) are probably the
tradesmen or smaller dealers who travelled about in the country, and
רכלים the wholesale dealers. This explanation of תּרים cannot be
rendered doubtful by the objection that תּוּר only occurs elsewhere in
connection with the wandering about of spies; for רכל signified
originally to go about, spy out, or retail scandal, and after that to
trade, and go about as a tradesman. הערב מלכי are not kings of the
auxiliary and allied nations (Chald., Ges.), but kings of the mixed
population, and according to [Jer
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024.md), more especially of the
population of Arabia Deserta (בּמּדבּר השּׁכנים), which bordered upon
Palestine; for ערב rof is a mixed crowd of all kinds of men, who either
attach themselves to a nation ([Exo
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038).md), or live in the midst of it as
foreigners ([Neh 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#003).md), hence a number
of mercenaries ([Jer 50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037).md). In [Ch2
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#014.md), הערב is therefore correctly
explained by the term ערב, which does not mean the whole of Arabia, but
"only a tract of country not very extensive on the east and south of
Palestine" (Gesenius), as these tribes were tributary of Solomon. הארץ
פּחות, the governors of the land, are probably the officers named in
[Kg1 4:7-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007.md). As they collected the
duties in the form of natural productions and delivered them in that
form, so also did the tradesmen and merchants pay their duties, and the
subjugated pastoral tribes of Arabia their tribute, in natura. This
explains in a very simple manner why these revenues are separated from
the revenue of Solomon which came in the form of money. פּחה is a
foreign word, which first found its way into the Hebrew language after
the times of the Assyrians, and sprang from the Sanscrit paksha, a
companion or friend, which took the form of pakkha in Prakrit, and
probably of pakha in the early Persian (vid., Benfey and Stern, die
Monatsnamen, p. 195).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 10:16</span></span>

Solomon had 500 ornamental shields made, 200 larger ones (צנּים, scuta,
targets), and 300 smaller (מגנּים, clypei). These shields, like all the
shields of the ancients, were made of wood or basket-work, and covered
with gold plate instead of leather (see my bibl. Archol. ii. pp.
296ff.). שׁחוּט זהב does not mean aurum jugulatum, i.e., gold mixed with
metal of a different kind, but, as Kimchi has shown, aurum diductum,
beaten gold, from שׁחט, to stretch; since Solomon would certainly use
pure gold for these ornamental shields. "Six hundred shekels of gold he
spread upon one target," that is to say, he used for gilding one target.
Six hundred shekels would weigh about 17 1/2 lbs., so that the value of
the gold upon a target would be more than 5000 thalers (750), supposing
that the Mosaic shekel is meant. But this is rendered doubtful by the
fact that the gold upon the small shields is estimated at three minae.
If, for example, the three minae are equal to three hundred shekels,
according to [Ch2 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#016.md), as is
generally assumed, a hundred shekels are reckoned as one mina; and as
the mina only contained fifty Mosaic shekels, according to [Eze
45:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#012.md), the reference must be to
shekels after the king's weight ([Sa2
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#026).md), which were only half the
sacred shekels (see my bibl. Archol. ii. p. 135). Consequently the gold
plate upon one target was not quite 9 lbs., and that upon a shield not
quite 4 1/2 lbs. These shields were intended for the body-guard to carry
on state occasions ([Kg1 14:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#027.md);
[Ch2 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#010).md), and were kept in the
house of the forest of Lebanon ([Kg1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 10:18</span></span>

Solomon had a great throne of ivory made, and had it overlaid with fine
gold. כּסּא־שׁן is not a throne made of ivory, but one merely ornamented
with ivory; and we are to imagine the gilding as effected by laying the
gold simply upon the wood, and inserting the ivory within the gold
plate. מוּפז, a hophal participle of פּזז: aurum depuratum, hence = טהור
in [Ch2 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#017.md). The throne had six
steps, and a "rounded head on the hinder part thereof," i.e., a back
which was arched above or rounded off,

(Note: Instead of מאחריו לכּסּה עגול וראשׁ we have in the Chronicles
מאחזים לכּסּא בּזּהב וכבשׁ, "and a footstool in gold fastened to the
throne" (the plural מאחזים refers to the footstool and the steps). Now,
however easily מאחזים may have been written by mistake for מאחריו, זהב
כבשׁ cannot have grown out of עגול ראשׁ by any such mistake. The
quid-pro-quo of the lxx for עגול rof xxl ראשׁ, προτομαὶ μόσχων, in which
עגול is certainly confounded with עגל, does not warrant the conjecture
of Thenius, that the Chronicler found עגל in his original and
substituted כּבשׂ (lamb), whereupon כּבשׂ (lamb) was changed by another
hand into כּבשׁ footstep, and ראשׁ was dropped altogether.)

and ירת, arms, i.e., arms on both sides of the seat (השּׁבת מקום), and
two lions standing by the side of the arms. Beside this there were
twelve lions upon the six steps, namely two upon each step, one on this
side and one on that. Instead of אריים ([Kg1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#020).md) we find ארירת in [Kg1
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#019.md), just as we do in both verses of
the Chronicles, not because the reference is to artificial, inanimate
figures and not to natural lions, as Thenius supposes, but because the
plural ending ים- is an unusual one with this word; and even where
natural lions are spoken of, we always find ארירת in other passages (cf.
[Jdg 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005.md); [Sa2
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#023.md); [Kg2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025.md); [Sol
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008), etc..md). The lions were symbols of
the ruler's authority; and the twelve lions upon the steps may possibly
have pointed to the rule over the twelve tribes of Israel, which was
concentrated in the throne; not "watchers of the throne," as Thenius
thinks. This throne was so splendid a work, that the historian observes
that nothing of the kind had ever been made for any other kingdom. Upon
the early Assyrian monuments we do indeed find high seats depicted,
which are very artistically worked, and provided with backs and arms,
and some with the arms supported by figures of animals (see Layard's
Nineveh and its Remains, vol. ii. p. 301), but none resembling Solomon's
throne. It is not till a later age that the more splendid thrones appear
(vid., Rosenmller, A. u. N. Morgenland, iii. pp. 176ff.).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 10:21</span></span>

The drinking vessels of Solomon also were all of gold, and all the
vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon of costly gold (סגוּר: see
at [Kg1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020).md). Silver was counted as
nothing, because the Tarshish fleet arrived once in three years,
bringing gold, silver, etc. (see at [Kg1
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 10:23</span></span>

In [Kg1 10:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023.md) everything that had
to be stated concerning the wealth, wisdom, and revenue of Solomon is
summed up as conclusion (cf. [Ch2
9:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#022.md) and [Ch2
1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014).md).

[Kg1 10:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023.md)

[Kg1 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023.md), [Kg1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#024.md) point back to [Kg1
5:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#009.md). ויּגדּל: Solomon became
greater, not was greater, on account of the Vv consec. כּל־הארץ, all the
world, corresponds to כּל־העמּים in [Kg1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#014.md). The foreigners out of all lands,
who came on account of his wisdom, brought Solomon presents: gold and
silver vessels, clothes (שׂלמות, court dresses, which are still
customary presents in the East), נשׁק, armour, spices, horses and mules.

[Kg1 10:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md)

[Kg1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md) is simply a repetition of
[Kg1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md) (compare also [Kg1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019).md); and [Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027.md) is merely a further extension of
[Kg1 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021.md). The words of [Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027.md), "Solomon made silver like
stones in Jerusalem, and cedars like the sycamores in the lowland for
abundance," are a hyperbolical description of his collection of enormous
quantities of precious metals and costly wood. שׁקמים, sycomori,
mulberry fig-trees, are very rare in Palestine in its present desolate
state (see Rob. Pal. iii. 27), and are only met in any abundance in
Egypt; but in ancient times they abounded in the lowlands of Palestine
to such an extent, that they were used as common building wood (vid.,
[Isa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#009.md), on which Theodoret observes,
τούτων (συκαμίνων) ἡ Παλαιστίνη πεπλήρωται). According to [Ch1
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#028.md), the sycamore forests in the
lowland of Judah were royal domains.

[Kg1 10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md)

(cf. [Ch2 1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#016)). "And (as for.md) the
going out of horses from Egypt for Solomon, a company of king's
merchants fetched (horses) for a definite price." This is the only
possible explanation of the verse according to the Masoretic
punctuation; but to obtain it, the first מקוה must be connected with
סחרי in opposition to the accents, and the second must be pointed מקוה.
This is the rendering adopted by Gesenius in his Thesaurus and Lexicon
(ed. Dietr. s. v. מקוה). The meaning company or troop may certainly be
justified from [Gen 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#010.md); [Exo
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019.md), and [Lev
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#036.md), where the word signifies an
accumulation of water. Still there is something very strange not only in
the application of the word both to a company of traders and also to a
troop of horses, but also in the omission of סוּסים (horses) after the
second מקוה. Hence the rendering of the lxx and Vulgate deserves
attention, and may possibly be the one to be preferred (as Michaelis,
Bertheau on Chron., and Movers assume). The translators of these
versions have taken מקוה as the name of a place, ἐξ Ἐκουέ, or rather ἐκ
Κουέ, de Coa.

(Note: That Κουέ or Κωέ is the earliest reading of the lxx, and not the
ἐκ Θεκουέ of the Cod. Vat. and Alex., is very evident from the statement
which we find in the Onomast. of Eusebius (ed. Larsow et Parth. p. 260),
Κώδ, πλησίον Αἰγύπτου; for which Jerome has Coa, quae est juxta
Aegyptum, after the Vulgate.)

According to this, the rendering would be: "And as for the going out of
horses from Egypt and Koa (or Kawe) for Solomon, the king's traders
fetched them from Joa (Kawe) for a fixed price." It is true that the
situation of Koa cannot be more precisely defined; but there seems to be
very little doubt that it was a place for the collection of customs upon
the frontier of Egypt.

[Kg1 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029.md)

"And there came up and went out a chariot from Egypt for six hundred
shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty shekels; and so
(in the same manner as for Solomon) they led them out for all the kings
of the Hittites and the kings of Aram through their hand." מרכּבה, like
רכב in [Sa2 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004.md); [Sa2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018.md), and [Eze
39:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#020.md), denotes a chariot with the team
of horses belonging to it, possibly three horses (see at [Kg1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006).md), not quadriga (Clericus and
others), or two draught horses and two as a reserve (Thenius). For the
inference, that if a horse cost 150 shekels, a team of four would be
obtained for 600, is not quite a certain one, since the chariot itself
would certainly not be given in. A hundred and fifty shekels are a
little more than 130 thalers (19, 10s. - Tr.), and 600 would be 525
thalers (78, 15s.). These amounts are sufficient to show how untenable
the opinion of Movers is, that the sums mentioned are not the prices
paid for horses and chariots, but the payment made for their exit, or
the customs duty. And his other opinion is quite equally erroneous,
namely that the chariots and horses were state carriages and horses of
luxury intended for the king. - The merchants are called the king's
traders, not because a portion of their profits went into the royal
treasury as the tax upon trade (Bertheau), nor as the brokers who bought
for the king (Thenius), but because they carried on their trade for the
king's account. בּידם cannot be adduced as evidence to the contrary; for
linguists require no proof that this cannot mean "auf ihre Hand," as
Thenius assumes. Bttcher's explanation is the right one, namely,
"through their hand," inasmuch as they brought the horses and chariots
themselves even to those kings who lived at a greater distance, without
employing intermediate agents. The kings of the חתּים, the Hittites in
the wider sense (= Canaanites, as in [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004.md); [Kg2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006.md); [Eze
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003).md), and of Aram, were in part
Solomon's vassals, since his rule extended over all the Canaanites with
the exception of the Phoenicians, and over several kingdoms of Aram.
