### [Job Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#001.md)

[Job 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 23:1</span></span>

1 Then began Job, and said:

2 Even to-day my complaint still biddeth defiance,

My hand lieth heavy upon my groaning.

3 Oh that I knew where I might find Him,

That I might come even to His dwelling-place!

4 I would lay the cause before Him,

And fill my mouth with arguments:

5 I should like to know the words He would answer me,

And attend to what He would say to me.

Since מרי (for which the lxx reads ἐκ τοῦ χειρός μου, מידי; Ew. מידו,
from his hand) usually elsewhere signifies obstinacy, it appears that
[Job 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002.md) ought to be explained: My
complaint is always accounted as rebellion (against God); but by this
rendering [Job 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002.md) requires some sort
of expletive, in order to furnish a connected thought: although the hand
which is upon me stifles my groaning (Hirz.); or, according to another
rendering of the על: et pourtant mes gmissements n'galent pas mes
souffrances (Renan. Schlottm.). These interpretations are objectionable
on account of the artificial restoration of the connection between the
two members of the verse, which they require; they lead one to expect
וידי (as a circumstantial clause: lxx, Cod. Vat. καὶ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ). As
the words stand, it is to be supposed that the definition of time,
גּם־היּום (even to-day still, as [Zac
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#012).md), belongs to both divisions of
the verse. How, then, is מרי to be understood? If we compare [Job
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011.md); [Job
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001.md), where מר, which is combined with
שׂיח, signifies amarum = amartiduo, it is natural to take מרי also in
the signification amaritudo, acerbitas (Targ., Syr., Jer.); and this is
also possible, since, as is evident from [Exo
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021.md), comp. [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md), the verbal forms מרר and מרה
run into one another, as they are really cognates.

(Note: מרר and מרה both spring from the root מר \[vid. supra, p. 396,
note\], with the primary signification stringere, to beat, rub, draw
tight. Hence Arab. mârrâ, to touch lightly, smear upon (to go by, over,
or through, to move by, etc.), but also stringere palatum, of an
astringent taste, strong in taste, to be bitter, opp. Arab. ḥalâ, soft
and mild in taste, to be sweet, as in another direction חלה, to be
loose, weak, sick, both from the root Arab. ḥl in ḥalla, solvit,
laxavit. From the signification to be tight come amarra, to stretch
tight, istamarra, to stretch one's self tight, to draw one's self out in
this state of tension - of things in time, to continue unbroken; mirreh,
string, cord; מרה, to make and hold one's self tight against any one,
i.e., to be obstinate: originally of the body, as Arab. mârrâ, tamârrâ,
to strengthen themselves in the contest against one another; then of the
mind, as Arab. mârâ, tamârâ, to struggle against anything, both
outwardly by contradiction and disputing, and inwardly by doubt and
unbelief. - Fl.)

But it is more satisfactory, and more in accordance with the relation of
the two divisions of the verse, if we keep to the usual signification of
מרי; not, however, understanding it of obstinacy, revolt, rebellion
(viz., in the sense of the friends), but, like moreh, [Kg2
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026).md) which describes the affliction
as stiff-necked, obstinate), of stubbornness, defiance, continuance in
opposition, and explain with Raschi: My complaint is still always
defiance, i.e., still maintains itself in opposition, viz., against God,
without yielding (Hahn, Olsh.: unsubmitting); or rather: against such
exhortations to penitence as those which Eliphaz has just addressed to
him. In reply to these, Job considers his complain to be well justified
even to-day, i.e., even now (for it is not, with Ewald, to be imagined
that, in the mind of the poet, the controversy extends over several
days, - an idea which would only be indicated by this one word).

In [Job 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002.md) he continues the same
thought under a different form of expression. My hand lies heavy on my
groaning, i.e., I hold it immoveably fast (as Fleischer proposes to take
the words); or better: I am driven to a continued utterance of it.

(Note: The idea might also be: My hand presses my groaning back (because
it would be of no use to me); but [Job
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002.md) is against this, and the Arab.
kamada, to restrain inward pain, anger, etc. by force (e.g., mât kemed,
he died from suppressed rage or anxiety), has scarcely any etymological
connection with כבד.)

By this interpretation ydy retains its most natural meaning, manus mea,
and the connection of the two members of the verse without any particle
is best explained. On the other hand, all modern expositors, who do not,
as Olsh., at once correct ידי into ידו, explain the suffix as objective:
the hand, i.e., the destiny to which I have to submit, weighs upon my
sighing, irresistibly forcing it out from me. Then [Job
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002.md) is related to [Job
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002.md) as a confirmation; and if,
therefore, a particle is to be supplied, it is כּי (Olsh.) and no other.
Thus, even the Targ. renders it machatiy, plaga mea. Job's affliction is
frequently traced back to the hand of God, [Job
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#021.md), comp. [Job
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011.md); [Job
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#005.md); [Job
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021.md); and on the suffix used
objectively (pass.) we may compare [Job
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014.md), חקּי; [Job
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029.md), אמרו; and especially [Job
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#006.md), חצּי. The interpretation: the
hand upon me is heavy above my sighing, i.e., heavier than it (Ramban,
Rosenm., Ges., Schlottm., Renan), also accords with the connection. על
can indeed be used in this comparative meaning, [Exo
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#005.md); [Ecc
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md); but כבדה יד על is an established
phrase, and commonly used of the burden of the hand upon any one, [Psa
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md) (comp. [Job
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#007.md), in the division in which Elihu
is introduced; and the connection with אל, [Sa1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006.md), and שׁם, [Sa1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#011).md); and this usage of the language
renders the comparative rendering very improbable. But it is also
improbable that "my hand" is = the hand that is upon me, since it cannot
be shown that יד was directly used in the sense of plaga; even the
Arabic, among the many turns of meaning which it gives to Arab. yd, does
not support this, and least of all would an Arab conceive of Arab. ydâ
passively, plaga quam patior. Explain, therefore: his complain now, as
before, offers resistance to the exhortation of the friends, which is
not able to lessen it, his (Job's) hand presses upon his lamentation so
that it is forced to break forth, but - without its justification being
recognised by men. This thought urges him on to the wish that he might
be able to pour forth his complain directly before God. מי־יתּן is at
one time followed by an accusative ([Job
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004.md); [Job
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#002.md); [Job
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031.md), [Job
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#035.md), to which belongs also the
construction with the inf., [Job
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#005).md), at another by the fut., with or
without Waw (as here, [Job 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003.md), [Job
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008.md); [Job
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#005.md); [Job
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013.md); [Job
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#023).md), and at another by the perf.,
with or without Waw (as here, [Job
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003.md): utinam noverim, and [Deu
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#026).md). And ידעתּי is, as in [Job
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#022.md), joined with the fut.: scirem
(noverim) et invenirem instead of possim invenire eum (למצאו), Ges. 142,
3, c. If he but knew how to reach Him (God), could attain to His throne;
תּכוּנה (everywhere from כּוּן, not from תּכן) signifies the setting up,
i.e., arrangement ([Eze 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#011).md) or
establishment ([Nah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#010).md) of a
dwelling, and the thing itself which is set out and established, here of
the place where God's throne is established. Having attained to this, he
would lay his cause (instuere causam, as [Job
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018.md), comp. [Job
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#005).md) before Him, and fill his mouth
with arguments to prove that he has right on his side (תּוכחות, as [Psa
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#015.md), of the grounds of defence, or
proof that he is in the right and his opponent in the wrong). In [Job
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005.md) we may translate: I would, or: I
should like (to learn); in the Hebrew, as in cognoscerem, both are
expressed; the substance of [Job 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005.md)
makes the optative rendering more natural. He would like to know the
words with which He would meet him,

(Note: אדעה is generally accented with Dech, מלים with Munach, according
to which Dachselt interprets: scirem, quae eloquia responderet mihi
Deus, but this is incorrect. The old editions have correctly אדעה
Munach, מלים Munach (taking the place of Dech, because the Athnach-word
which follows has not two syllables before the tone-syllable; vid.,
Psalter, ii. 104, 4).)

and would give heed to what He would say to him. But will He condescend?
will He have anything to do with the matter? -

[Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 23:6</span></span>

6 Will He contend with me with great power?

No, indeed; He will only regard me!

7 Then the upright would be disputing with Him,

And I should for ever escape my judge.

8 Yet I go eastward, He is not there,

And westward, but I perceive Him not;

9 Northwards where He worketh, but I behold Him not;

He turneth aside southwards, and I see Him not.

The question which Job, in [Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md),
puts forth: will He contend with me in the greatness or fulness of His
strength, i.e., (as [Job 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#018).md) with a
calling forth of all His strength? he himself answers in [Job
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md), hoping that the contrary may be
the case: no, indeed, He will not do that.

(Note: With this interpretation, לא should certainly have Rebia
mugrasch; its accentuation with Mercha proceeds from another
interpretation, probably non ituque ponet in me (manum suam), according
to which the Targ. translates. Others, following this accentuation, take
לא in the sense of הלא (vid., in Dachselt), or are at pains to obtain
some other meaning from it.)

לא is here followed not by the כּי, which is otherwise customary after a
negation in the signification imo, but by the restrictive exceptive אך,
which never signifies sed, sometimes verum tamen ([Psa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016.md); comp. supra, [Job
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015).md), but here, as frequently,
tantummodo, and, according to the hyperbaton which has been mentioned so
often, is placed at the beginning of the sentence, and belongs not to
the member of the sentence immediately following it, but to the whole
sentence (as in Arabic also the restrictive force of the Arab. innamâ
never falls upon what immediately follows it): He will do nothing but
regard me (ישׂים, scil. לב, elsewhere with על of the object of regard or
reflection, [Job 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023.md); [Job
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015.md); [Jdg
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#030.md), and without an ellipsis, ch.
[Job 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008.md); also with אל, [Job
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#003.md), or ל, [Sa1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#020.md); here designedly with בּ, which
unites in itself the significations of the Arab. b and fı̂, of seizing,
and of plunging into anything). Many expositors (Hirz., Ew., and others)
understand [Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md) as expressing a
wish: "Shall He contend with me with overwhelming power? No, I do not
desire that; only that He may be a judge attentive to the cause, not a
ruler manifesting His almighty power." But [Job
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md), taken thus, would be purely
rhetorical, since this question (shall He, etc.) certainly cannot be
seriously propounded by Job; accordingly, [Job
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md) is not intended as expressing a
wish, but a hope. Job certainly wishes the same thing in [Job
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034.md); [Job
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021.md); but in the course of the
discussion he has gradually acquired new confidence in God, which here
once more breaks through. He knows that God, if He would but be found,
would also condescend to hear his defence of himself, that He would
allow him to speak, and not overwhelm him with His majesty.

[Job 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007.md)

The question arises here, whether the שׁם which follows is to be
understood locally (Arab. ṯamma) or temporally (Arab. ṯumma); it is
evident from [Job 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#012.md); [Psa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md); [Psa
66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006.md); [Hos
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017.md); [Zep
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#014.md), that it may be used temporally;
in many passages, e.g., Ps. 36:13, the two significations run into one
another, so that they cannot be distinguished. We here decide in favour
of the temporal signification, against Rosenm., Schlottm., and Hahn; for
if שׁם be understood locally, a "then" must be supplied, and it may
therefore be concluded that this שׁם is the expression for it. We assume
at the same time that נוכח is correctly pointed as part. with Kametz;
accordingly it is to be explained: then, if He would thus pay attention
to me, an upright man would be contending with Him, i.e., then it would
be satisfactorily proved that an upright man may contend with Him. In
[Job 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007.md), פּלּט, like מלּט, [Job
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#020.md) (comp. פּתּח, to have open, to
stand open), is intensive of Kal: I should for ever escape my judge,
i.e., come off most completely free from unmerited punishment. Thus it
ought to be if God could be found, but He cannot be found. The הן, which
according to the sense may be translated by "yet" (comp. [Job
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#016).md), introduces this antithetical
relation: Yet I go towards the east (הן with Mahpach, קדם with Munach),
and He is not there; and towards the west (אחור, comp. אחרנים,
occidentales, [Job 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#020).md), and
perceive Him not (expressed as in [Job
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011.md); בּין ל elsewhere: to attend to
anything, [Job 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#021.md); [Deu
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029.md); [Psa
73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md); here, as there, to perceive
anything, so that לו is equivalent to אתו). In [Job
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009.md) the left (שׂמאול, Arab. shemâl,
or even without the substantival termination, on which comp. Jesurun,
pp. 222-227, sham, shâm) is undoubtedly an appellation of the north, and
the right (ימין, Arab. jem̌̂n) an appellation of the south; both words are
locatives which outwardly are undefined. And if the usual signification
of עשׂה and עטף are retained, it is to be explained thus: northwards or
in the north, if He should be active - I behold not; if He veil himself
southwards or in the south - I see not. This explanation is also
satisfactory so far as [Job 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009.md) is
concerned, so that it is unnecessary to understand בּעשׂתו other than in
[Job 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#026.md), and with Blumenfeld to
translate according to the phrase עשׂה דרכּו, [Jdg
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#008.md) : if He makes His way northwards;
or even with Umbr. to call in the assistance of the Arab. gšâ (to
cover), which neither here nor [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md); [Job
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#027.md), is admissible, since even then
שׂמאול בעשׂתו cannot signify: if He hath concealed himself on the left
hand (in the north). Ewald's combination of עשׂה with עטה, in the
assumed signification "to incline to" of the latter, is to be passed
over as useless. On the other hand, much can be said in favour of
Ewald's translation of [Job 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009.md): "if
He turn to the right hand - I see Him not;" for (1) the Arab. gṭf, by
virtue of the radical notion,

(Note: The Arab. verb ‛ṭf signifies trans. to turn, or lay, anything
round, so that it is laid or drawn over something else and covers it;
hence Arab. ‛ṭâf, a garment that is cast round one, Arab. ta‛aṭṭafa with
Arab. b of a garment: to cast it or wrap it about one. Intrans. to turn
aside, depart from, of deviating from a given direction, deflectere,
declinare; also, to turn in a totally opposite direction, to turn one's
self round and to go back. - Fl.)

which is also traceable in the Heb. עטף, signifies both trans. and
intrans. to turn up, bend aside; (2) Saadia translates: "and if He turns
southwards (‛atafa gunûban);" (3) Schultens correctly observes: עטף
significatione operiendi commodum non efficit sensum, nam quid mirum is
quem occultantem se non conspiciamus. We therefore give the preference
to this Arabic rendering of יעטף. If יעטף, in the sense of obvelat se,
does not call to mind the חדרי תּמן, penetralia austri, [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md) (comp. Arab. chidr, velamen,
adytum), neither will בעשׂתו point to the north as the limit of the
divine dominion. Such conceptions of the extreme north and south are
nowhere found among the Arabs as among the Arian races (vid., [Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013).md);

(Note: In contrast to the extreme north, the abode of the gods, the
habitation of life, the extreme south is among the Arians the abode of
the prince of death and of demons, Jama (vid., p. 421) with his
attendants, and therefore the habitation of death.)

and, moreover, the conception of the north as the abode of God cannot be
shown to be biblical, either from [Job
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022.md); [Eze
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004.md), or still less from [Psa
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003.md). With regard to the syntax, יעטף
is a hypothetical fut., as [Job 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md);
[Job 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#027.md). The use of the fut. apoc.
אחז, like אט, [Job 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011.md), without a
voluntative or aoristic signification, is poetic. Towards all quarters
of the heavens he turns, i.e., with his eyes and the longing of his
whole nature, if he may by any means find God. But He evades him, does
not reveal Himself in any place whatever.

The כּי which now follows does not give the reason of Job's earnest
search after God, but the reason of His not being found by him. He does
not allow Himself to be seen anywhere; He conceals Himself from him,
lest He should be compelled to acknowledge the right of the sufferer,
and to withdraw His chastening hand from him.

[Job 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 23:10</span></span>

10 For He knoweth the way that is with me:

If He should prove me, I should come forth as gold.

11 My foot held firm to His steps;

His way I kept, and turned not aside.

12 The command of His lips - I departed not from it;

More than my own determination I kept the words of His mouth.

13 Yet He remaineth by one thing, and who can turn Him?

And He accomplisheth what His soul desireth.

That which is not merely outwardly, but inwardly with (אם) any one, is
that which he thinks and knows (his consciousness), [Job
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#035.md); [Job
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#009.md), or his willing and acting, [Job
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#013.md); [Job
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011.md) : he is conscious of it, he
intends to do it; here, [Job 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010.md), עם
is intended in the former sense, in [Job
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014.md) in the latter. The "way with me"
is that which his conscience (συνείδησις) approves (συμμαρτυρεῖ); comp.
Psychol. S. 134. This is known to God, so that he who is now set down as
a criminal would come forth as tried gold, in the event of God allowing
him to appear before Him, and subjecting him to judicial trial. בּחנני
is the praet. hypotheticum so often mentioned, which is based upon the
paratactic character of the Hebrew style, as [Gen
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#022.md); [Rut
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#009.md); [Zac
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#006.md); Ges. 155, 4, a. His foot has
held firmly

(Note: On אחז, Carey correctly observes, and it explains the form of the
expression: The oriental foot has a power of grasp and tenacity, because
not shackled with shoes from early childhood, of which we can form but
little idea.)

to the steps of God (אשׁוּר, together with אשּׁוּר, [Job
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007), from אשׁר Piel, to go on.md), so
that he was always close behind Him as his predecessor (אחז( ro synon.
תּמך, [Psa 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md); [Pro
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#005).md). He guarded, i.e., observed His
way, and turned not aside (אט fut. apoc. Hiph. in the intransitive sense
of deflectere, as e.g., [Psa 125:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#005).md).

In [Job 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012.md), מצות שׂפתיו precedes as
cas. absolutus (as respects the command of His lips); and what is said
in this respect follows with Waw apod. (= Arab. f) without the
retrospective pronoun ממּנּה (which is omitted for poetic brevity). On
this prominence of a separate notion after the manner of an antecedent.
The Hiph. המישׁ, like הטּה, [Job
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011.md), and הלּיז, [Pro
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#021.md), is not causative, but simply
active in signification. In [Job 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012.md)
the question arises, whether צפן מן is one expression, as in [Job
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#004.md), in the sense of "hiding from
another," or whether מן is comparative. In the former sense Hirz.
explains: I removed the divine will from the possible ascendancy of my
own. But since צפן is familiar to the poet in the sense of preserving
and laying by (צפוּנים( y, treasures, [Job
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026).md), it is more natural to explain,
according to [Psa 119:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011.md) : I kept the
words (commands) of Thy mouth, i.e., esteemed them high and precious,
more than my statute, i.e., more than what my own will prescribed for
me.

(Note: Wetzstein arranges the significations of צפן as follows: - 1.
(Beduin) intr. fut. i, to contain one's self, to keep still (hence in
Hebr. to lie in wait), to be rapt in thought; conjug. II. c. acc. pers.
to make any one thoughtful, irresolute. 2. (Hebr.) trans. fut. o, to
keep anything to one's self, to hold back, to keep to one's self; Niph.
to be held back, i.e., either concealed or reserved for future use. Thus
we see how, on the one hand, צפן is related to טמן, e.g., [Job
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026) (Arab. itmaanna, to be still.md);
and, on the other, can interchange with צפה in the signification
designare (comp. [Job 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#022.md) with [Job
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020.md); [Job
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019).md), and to spy, lie in wait (comp.
[Psa 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008.md); [Psa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md); [Pro
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011.md), [Pro
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#018.md), with [Psa
37:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#032))..md)

The meaning is substantially the same; the lxx, which translates ἐν δὲ
κόλπῳ μου (בּחקי), which Olsh. considers to be "perhaps correct,"
destroys the significance of the confession. Hirz. rightly refers to the
"law in the members," [Rom 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md) : חקּי
is the expression Job uses for the law of the sinful nature which
strives against the law of God, the wilful impulse of selfishness and
evil passion, the law which the apostle describes as ἕτερος νόμος, in
distinction from the νόμος τοῦ Θεοῦ (Psychol. S. 379). Job's conscience
can give him this testimony, but He, the God who so studiously avoids
him, remains in one mind, viz., to treat him as a criminal; and who can
turn Him from His purpose? (the same question as [Job
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012.md); [Job
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#010).md); His soul wills it (stat pro
ratione voluntas), and He accomplishes it. Most expositors explain
permanet in uno in this sense; the Beth is the usual ב with verbs of
entering upon and persisting in anything. Others, however, take the ב as
Beth essentiae: He remains one and the same, viz., in His conduct
towards me (Umbr., Vaih.), or: He is one, is alone, viz., in absolute
majesty (Targ. Jer.; Schult., Ew., Hlgst., Schlottm.), which is
admissible, since this Beth occurs not only in the complements of a
sentence ([Psa 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md), like a shadow;
[Isa 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010.md), after the manner of
silver; [Psa 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md), in great number;
[Psa 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002), as my help.md), but also with
the predicate of a simple sentence, be it verbal ([Job
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#013.md); [Pro
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#026).md) or substantival ([Exo
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#004.md); [Psa
118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007).md). The same construction is found
also in Arabic, where, however, it is more frequent in simple negative
clauses than in affirmative (vid., Psalter, i. 272). The assertion: He
is one (as in the primary monotheistic confession, [Deu
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004).md), is, however, an expression for
the absoluteness of God, which is not suited to this connection; and if
הוא באחד is intended to be understood of the unchangeable uniformity of
His purpose concerning Job, the explanation: versatur (perstat) in uno,
Arab. hua fi wâhidin, is not only equally, but more natural, and we
therefore prefer it.

Here again God appears to Job to be his enemy. His confidence towards
God is again overrun by all kinds of evil, suspicious thoughts. He seems
to him to be a God of absolute caprice, who punishes where there is no
ground for punishment. There is indeed a phrase of the abiding fact
which he considers superior to God and himself, both being conceived of
as contending parties; and this phase God avoids, He will not hear it.
Into this vortex of thoughts, as terrible as they are puerile, Job is
hurried forward by the persuasion that his affliction is a decree of
divine justice. The friends have greatly confirmed him in this
persuasion; so that his consciousness of innocence, and the idea of God
as inflicting punishment, are become widely opposite extremes, between
which his faith is hardly able to maintain itself. It is not his
affliction in itself, but this persuasion, which precipitates him into
such a depth of conflict, as the following strophe shows.

[Job 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 23:14</span></span>

14 For He accomplisheth that which is appointed for me,

And much of a like kind is with Him.

15 Therefore I am troubled at His presence;

If I consider it, I am afraid of Him.

16 And God hath caused my heart to be dejected,

And the Almighty hath put me to confusion;

17 For I have not been destroyed before darkness,

And before my countenance, which thick darkness covereth.

Now it is the will of God, the absolute, which has all at once turned
against him, the innocent ([Job
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013).md); for what He has decreed
against him (חקּי) He also brings to a complete fulfilment (השׁלים, as
e.g., [Isa 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026).md); and the same
troubles as those which he already suffers, God has still more
abundantly decreed for him, in order to torture him gradually, but
surely, to death. Job intends [Job
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014.md) in reference to himself, not as
a general assertion: it is, in general, God's way of acting. Hahn's
objection to the other explanation, that Job's affliction, according to
his own previous assertions, has already attained its highest degree,
does not refute it; for Job certainly has a term of life before him,
though it be but short, in which the wondrously inventive ([Job
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#016).md) hostility of God can heap up
ever new troubles for him. On the other hand, the interpretation of the
expression in a general sense is opposed by the form of the expression
itself, which is not that God delights to do this, but that He purposes
(עמּו) to do it. It is a conclusion from the present concerning the
future, such as Job is able to make with reference to himself; while he,
moreover, abides by the reality in respect to the mysterious
distribution of the fortunes of men. Therefore, because he is a mark for
the enmity of God, without having merited it, he is confounded before
His countenance, which is so angrily turned upon him (comp. פנים, [Psa
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md); [Lam
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016).md); if he considers it (according
to the sense fut. hypothet., as [Job
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009).md), he trembles before Him, who
recompenses faithful attachment by such torturing pain. The following
connection with ל and the mention of God twice at the beginning of the
affirmations, is intended to mean: (I tremble before Him), and He it is
who has made me faint-hearted (הרך Hiph. from the Kal, [Deu
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#003.md), and freq., to be tender, soft,
disconcerted), and has troubled me; which is then supported in [Job
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017.md).

His suffering which draws him on to ruin he perceives, but it is not the
proper ground of his inward destruction; it is not the encircling
darkness of affliction, not the mysterious form of his suffering which
disconcerts him, but God's hostile conduct towards him, His angry
countenance as he seems to see it, and which he is nevertheless unable
to explain. Thus also Ew., Hirz., Vaih., Hlgst., and Schlottm. explain
the passage. The only other explanation worthy of mention is that which
finds in [Job 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017.md) the thought
already expressed in [Job 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#010.md) : For I
was not then destroyed, in order that I might experience such mysterious
suffering; and interpretation with which most of the old expositors were
satisfied, and which has been revived by Rosenm., Stick., and Hahn. We
translate: for I have not been destroyed before darkness (in order to be
taken away from it before it came upon me), and He has not hidden
darkness before my face; or as an exclamation: that I have not been
destroyed! which is to be equivalent to: Had I but been ... ! Apart from
this rendering of the quod non = utinam, which cannot be supported, (1)
It is doubly hazardous thus to carry the לא forward to the second line
in connection with verbs of different persons. (2) The darkness in [Job
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017.md) appears (at least according to
the usual interpret. caliginem) as that which is being covered, whereas
it is naturally that which covers something else; wherefore Blumenfeld
explains: and darkness has not hidden, viz., such pain as I must now
endure, from my face. (3) The whole thought which is thus gained is
without point, and meaningless, in this connection. On the other hand,
the antithesis between מפּניו and מפּני, ממּנוּ and מפּני־חשׁך, is at
once obvious; and this antithesis, which forces itself upon the
attention, also furnishes the thought which might be expected from the
context. It is unnecessary to take נצמת in a different signification
from [Job 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#017.md); in Arabic ṣmt
signifies conticescere; the idea of the root, however, is in general a
constraining depriving of free movement. חשׁך is intended as in the
question of Eliphaz, [Job 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011.md) : "Or
seest thou not the darkness?" to which it perhaps refers. It is
impossible, with Schlottm., to translate [Job
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017.md): and before that darkness covers
my face; מן is never other than a praep., not a conjunction with power
over a whole clause. It must be translated: et a facie mea quam obtegit
caligo. As the absolute פנים, [Job
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#027.md), signifies the appearance of the
countenance under pain, so here by it Job means his countenance
distorted by pain, his deformed appearance, which, as the attributive
clause affirms, is thoroughly darkened by suffering (comp. [Job
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030).md). But it is not this darkness
which stares him in the face, and threatens to swallow him up (comp.
מפני־חשׁך, [Job 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#012).md); not this his
miserable form, which the extremest darkness covers (on אפל, vid., [Job
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022).md), that destroys his inmost
nature; but the thought that God stands forth in hostility against him,
which makes his affliction so terrific, and doubly so in connection with
the inalienable consciousness of his innocence. From the
incomprehensible punishment which, without reason, is passing over him,
he now again comes to speak of the incomprehensible connivance of God,
which permits the godlessness of the world to go on unpunished.
