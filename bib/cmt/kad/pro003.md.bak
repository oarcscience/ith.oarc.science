### [Proverbs Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 3:3</span></span>

With this verse the doctrine begins; אל (not לא) shows the 3a does not
continue the promise of [Pro 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002.md). חסד
(R. חם, stringere, afficere) is, according to the prevailing usage of
the language, well-affectedness, it may be of God toward men, or of men
toward God, or of men toward one another - a loving disposition, of the
same meaning as the N.T. ἀγάπη (vid., e.g., [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006)). אמת (from אמנת.md), continuance, a
standing to one's promises, and not falsifying just expectations; thus
fidelity, πίστις, in the interrelated sense of fides and fidelitas.
These two states of mind and of conduct are here contemplated as moral
powers ([Psa 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#008.md); [Psa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003).md), which are of excellent service,
and bring precious gain; and 4b shows that their ramification on the
side of God and of men, the religious and the moral, remains radically
inseparable. The suffix ם does not refer to the doctrine and the
precepts, but to these two cardinal virtues. If the disciple is
admonished to bind them about his neck (vid., [Pro
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009.md), cf. [Pro
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022).md), so here reference is made, not
to ornament, nor yet to protection against evil influences by means of
them, as by an amulet

(Note: Fleischer is here reminded of the giraffe in the Jardin des
Plantes, the head of which was adorned by its Arabic keeper with strings
and jewels, the object of which was to turn aside the ‛ain \[the bad,
mischievous look\] from the precious beast.)

(for which proofs are wanting), but to the signet which was wont to be
constantly carried ([Gen 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#018.md), cf.
[Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006).md) on a string around the neck.
The parallel member 3c confirms this; 3b and 3c together put us in mind
of the Tephillim (phylacteries), [Exo
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#016.md); [Deu
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008.md); [Deu
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018.md), in which what is here a figure
is presented in external form, but as the real figure of that which is
required in the inward parts. לוּח (from לוּח, Arab. l'ah, to begin to
shine, e.g., of a shooting star, gleaming sword; vid., Wetzstein,
Deutsch. morgenl. Zeitschr. xxii. 151f.) signifies the tablet prepared
for writing by means of polish; to write love and fidelity on the tablet
of the heart, is to impress deeply on the heart the duty of both
virtues, so that one will be impelled to them from within outward ([Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033).md).

[Proverbs 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 3:4</span></span>

To the admonitory imper. there follows here a second, as [Pro
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#004.md); [Pro
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#013.md); [Amo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md); [Ch2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md), instead of which also the perf.
consec. might stand; the counsellor wishes, with the good to which he
advises, at the same time to present its good results. שׂכל is ([Sa1
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#003).md) the appearance, for the Arab.
shakl means forma, as uniting or binding the lineaments or contours into
one figure, σχῆμα, according to which שׂכל טוב may be interpreted of the
pleasing and advantageous impression which the well-built external
appearance of a man makes, as an image of that which his internal
excellence produces; thus, favourable view, friendly judgment, good
reputation (Ewald, Hitzig, Zckler). But everywhere else ([Pro
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#015.md); [Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md); [Ch2
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022).md) this phrase means good, i.e.,
fine, well-becoming insight, or prudence; and שׂכל has in the language
of the Mishle no other meaning than intellectus, which proceeds from the
inwardly forming activity of the mind. He obtains favour in the eyes of
God and man, to whom favour on both sides is shown; he obtains refined
prudence, to whom it is on both sides adjudicated. It is unnecessary,
with Ewald and Hitzig, to assign the two objects to God and men. In the
eyes of both at the same time, he who carries love and faithfulness in
his heart appears as one to whom חן and שׂכל טוב must be adjudicated.

[Proverbs 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 3:5</span></span>

Were "kindness and truth" ([Pro 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003).md)
understood only in relation to men, then the following admonition would
not be interposed, since it proceeds from that going before, if there
the quality of kindness and truth, not only towards man, but also
towards God, is commended:

5 Trust in Jahve with thy whole heart,

And lean not on thine own understanding.

6 In all thy ways acknowledge Him,

And He will make plain thy paths.

7 Be not wise in thine own eyes;

Fear Jahve, and depart from evil.

8 Health will then come to thy navel,

And refreshing to thy bones.

From God alone comes true prosperity, true help. He knows the right way
to the right ends. He knows what benefits us. He is able to free us from
that which does us harm: therefore it is our duty and our safety to
place our confidence wholly in Him, and to trust not to our own
judgment. The verb בּטח, Arab. baṭḥ, has the root-meaning expandere,
whence perhaps, by a more direct way than that noted under [Psa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md), it acquires the meaning
confidere, to lean with the whole body on something, in order to rest
upon it, strengthened by על, if one lean wholly - Fr. se reposer sur
quelqu'un; Ital. riposarsi sopra alcuno, - like השּׁען with אל, to lean
on anything, so as to be supported by it; with על, to support oneself on
anything (Fl.). דעהוּ (the same in form as שׂאהוּ, [Num
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012).md) is not fully represented by
"acknowledge Him;" as in [Ch1 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009.md) it
is not a mere theoretic acknowledgment that is meant, but earnest
penetrating cognizance, engaging the whole man. The practico-mystical
דעהוּ, in and of itself full of significance, according to O. and N.T.
usage, is yet strengthened by toto corde. The heart is the central seat
of all spiritual soul-strength; to love God with the whole heart is to
concentrate the whole inner life on the active contemplation of God, and
the ready observance of His will. God requites such as show regard to
Him, by making plain their path before them, i.e., by leading them
directly to the right end, removing all hindrances out of their way.
ארחתיך has Cholem in the first syllable (vid., Kimchi's Lex.).

(Note: In the st. constr. [Pro 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#019.md),
and with the grave suff. [Pro 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015.md), ǒ
instead of ō is in order; but Ben-Asher's ארחתי, [Job
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#027.md), cf. [Job
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#011), is an inconsistency..md)

"Be not wise in thine own eyes" is equivalent to ne tibi sapiens
videare; for, as J. H. Michaelis remarks, confidere Deo est sapere, sibi
vero ac suae sapientiae, desipere. "Fear God and depart from evil" is
the twofold representation of the εὐσέβεια, or practical piety, in the
Chokma writings: [Pro 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#006.md), the Mashal
[Psa 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md), [Psa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015.md), and [Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md) cf. [Pro
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002.md). For סר מרע, the post-biblical
expression is ירא חטא.

[Pro 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008.md)

The subject to תּהי; (it shall be) is just this religious-moral conduct.
The conjectural reading לבשׂרך (Clericus), לשׁרך = לשׁארך (Ewald,
Hitzig), to thy flesh or body, is unnecessary; the lxx and Syr. so
translating, generalize the expression, which is not according to their
taste. שׁר, from שׁרר, Arab. sarr, to be fast, to bind fast, properly,
the umbilical cord (which the Arabs call surr, whence the denom. sarra,
to cut off the umbilical cord of the newborn); thus the navel, the
origin of which coincides with the independent individual existence of
the new-born, and is as the firm centre (cf. Arab. saryr, foundation,
basis, Job, p. 487) of the existence of the body. The system of
punctuation does not, as a rule, permit the doubling of ר, probably on
account of the prevailing half guttural, i.e., the uvular utterance of
this sound by the men of Tiberias.

(Note: See my work, Physiologie u. Musik in ihrer Bedeutung fr Grammatik
besonders die hebrische, pp. 11-13.)

לשׁרּך here, and שׁרּך at [Eze 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004.md),
belong to the exceptions; cf. the expanded duplication in שׁררך, [Sol
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003.md), to which a chief form שׁרר is as
little to be assumed as is a הרר to הררי. The ἅπ. γεγρ. רפאוּת, healing,
has here, as מרפּא, [Pro 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#022.md); [Pro
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#024.md), and תּרוּפה, [Eze
47:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012.md), not the meaning of restoration
from sickness, but the raising up of enfeebled strength, or the
confirming of that which exists; the navel comes into view as the middle
point of the vis vitalis. שׁקּוּי is a Piel formation, corresponding to
the abstract Kal formation רפאוּת; the Arab. saqâ, used transit. (to
give to drink), also saqqâ (cf. Pu. [Job
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#024).md) and asqâ, like the Hebr. השׁקה
(Hiph. of שׁקה, to drink); the infin. (Arab.) saqy means, to the
obliterating of the proper signification, distribution, benefaction,
showing friendship, but in the passage before us is to be explained
after [Job 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#024.md) (the marrow of his
bones is well watered; Arnheim - full of sap) and [Pro
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#030.md). Bertheau and Hitzig erroneously
regard [Pro 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008.md) as the conclusion to
[Pro 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007.md), for they interpret רפאות as
the subject; but had the poet wished to be so understood, he should have
written וּתהי. Much rather the subject is devotion withdrawn from the
evil one and turned to God, which externally proves itself by the
dedication to Him of earthly possessions.

[Proverbs 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 3:9</span></span>

9 Honour Jahve with thy wealth,

And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:

10 Then shall thy barns be filled with plenty,

And thy vats overflow with must.

It may surprise us that the Chokma, being separated from the ceremonial
law, here commends the giving of tithes. But in the first place, the
consciousness of the duty of giving tithes is older than the Mosaic law,
[Gen 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022.md); in this case, the giving
of tithes is here a general ethical expression. עשּׂר and מעשׂר do not
occur in the Book of Proverbs; in the post-biblical phraseology the
tithes are called חלק הגּבהּ, the portion of the Most High. כּבּד, as
the Arab. waḳḳra, to make heavy, then to regard and deal with as weighty
and solemn (opp. קלּל, to regard and treat as light, from קלל = Arab.
hân, to be light). הון, properly lightness in the sense of aisance,
opulency, forms with כּבּד an oxymoron (fac Jovam gravem de levitate
tua), but one aimed at by the author neither at [Pro
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#013.md) nor here. מן (in מהונך and 'מר,
[Pro 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009).md) is in both cases partitive,
as in the law of the Levitical tenths, [Lev
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md), and of the Challa
(heave-offering of dough), [Num 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#021.md),
where also ראשׁית (in [Heb 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004.md),
ἀκροθίνια) occurs in a similar sense, cf. [Num
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012.md) (in the law of the Theruma or
wave-offering of the priests), as also תּבוּאה in the law of the second
tenths, [Deu 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md), cf. [Num
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#030.md) (in the law of the tenths of the
priests).

[Pro 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010.md)

With ו apodosis imperativi the conclusion begins. שׂבע, satisfaction, is
equivalent to fulness, making satisfied, and that, too, richly
satisfied; תּירושׁ ;deif also is such an accusative, as verbs of filling
govern it, for פּרץ, to break through especially to overflow, signifies
to be or become overflowingly full ([Job
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#010).md). אסם (from אסם, Chald. אסן, Syr.
âsan, to lay up in granaries) is the granary, of the same meaning as the
Arab. âkhzan (from khazan = חסן, [Isa
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018), recondere.md), whence the Spanish
magazen, the French and German magazin. יקב (from יקב, Arab. wakab, to
be hollow) is the vat or tub into which the must flows from the
wine-press (גּת or פּוּרה), λάκκος or ὑπολήνιον. Cf. the same admonition
and promise in the prophetic statement of [Mal
3:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md).

[Proverbs 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 3:11</span></span>

The contrast here follows. As God should not be forgotten in days of
prosperity, so one should not suffer himself to be estranged from Him by
days of adversity.

11 The school of Jahve, my son, despise thou not,

Nor loathe thou His correction;

12 For Jahve correcteth him whom He loveth,

And that as a father his son whom he loveth

Vid., the original passage [Job 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017.md).
There is not for the Book of Job a more suitable motto than this
tetrastich, which expresses its fundamental thought, that there is a
being chastened and tried by suffering which has as its motive the love
of God, and which does not exclude sonship.

(Note: Here Procop. rightly distinguishes between παιδεία and τιμωρία.)

One may say that [Pro 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md) expresses
the problem of the Book of Job, and [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012.md) its solution. מוּסר, παιδεία, we
have translated "school," for יסּר, παιδεύειν, means in reality to take
one into school. Ahndung \[punishment\] or Rge \[reproof\] is the German
word which most corresponds to the Hebr. תּוכחה or תּוכחת. קוּץ ב
(whence here the prohibitive תּקץ with אל) means to experience loathing
(disgust) at anything, or aversion (vexation) toward anything. The lxx
(cited [Heb 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005)..md), μηδὲ ἐκλύου, nor
be faint-hearted, which joins in to the general thought, that we should
not be frightened away from God, or let ourselves be estranged from Him
by the attitude of anger in which He appears in His determination to
inflict suffering. In 12a the accentuation leaves it undefined whether
יהוה as subject belongs to the relative or to the principal clause; the
traditional succession of accents, certified also by Ben Bileam, is כי
את אשׁר יאהב יהוה, for this passage belongs to the few in which more
than three servants (viz., Mahpach, Mercha, and three Munachs) go before
the Athnach.

(Note: Vid., Torath Emeth, p. 19; Accentuationssystem, vi. 6; the
differences between Ben-Asher and Ben-Naphtali in the Appendixes to
Biblia Rabbinica; Dachselt's Biblia Accentuata, and Pinner's Prospectus,
p. 91 (Odessa, 1845).)

The further peculiarity is here to be observed, that את, although
without the Makkeph, retains its Segol, besides here only in [Psa
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md); [Psa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002.md). 12b is to be interpreted thus
(cf. [Pro 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005)): "and (that.md) as a
father the son, whom he loves." The ו is explanatory, as [Sa1
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#003) (Gesenius, 155, 1a.md), and ירצה
(which one may supplement by אתו or בּו) is a defining clause having the
force of a clause with אשׁר. The translation et ut pater qui filio bene
cupit, is syntactically (cf. [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011)) and accentually (vid., 13b.md) not
less admissible, but translating "and as a father he holds his son
dear," or with Hitzig (after [Jer
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#010.md), a passage not quite
syntactically the same), "and holds him dear, as a father his son"
(which Zckler without syntactical authority prefers on account of the
2nd modus, cf. e.g., [Psa 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018).md), does
not seem a right parallel clause, since the giving of correction is the
chief point, and the love only the accompanying consideration ([Pro
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024).md). According to our
interpretation, יוכיח is to be carried forward in the mind from 12a. The
lxx find the parallel word in יכאב, for they translate μαστιγοῖ δὲ πάντα
υἱὸν, ὃν παραδέχεται, and thus have read יכאב or ויכאב.

[Proverbs 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 3:13</span></span>

Such submission to God, the All-wise, the All-directing, who loves us
with fatherly affection, is wisdom, and such wisdom is above all
treasures.

13 Blessed is the man who has found wisdom,

And the man who has gained understanding;

14 For better is her acquisition than the acquisition of silver,

And her gain than fine gold.

15 More precious is she than corals;

And all thy jewels do not equal her value.

The imperfect יפיק, which as the Hiph. of פּוּק, exire, has the general
meaning educere, interchanges with the perfect מצא. This bringing forth
is either a delivering up, i.e., giving out or presenting, [Isa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#010.md); [Psa
140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md); [Psa
144:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013.md) (cf. נפק, Arab. nafaḳ, to give
out, to pay out), or a fetching out, getting out, receiving, [Pro
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#035.md); [Pro
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002.md); [Pro
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022.md). Thus 13a reminds one of the
parable of the treasure in the field, and 13b of that of the goodly
pearl for which the ἔμπορος who sought the pearl parted with all that he
had. Here also is declared the promise of him who trades with a merchant
for the possession of wisdom; for סחרהּ and סחר (both, as [Isa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003.md), [Isa
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018.md); [Isa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015.md), from סחר, the latter after the
forms זרע, נטע, without our needing to assume a second primary form,
סחר) go back to the root-word סחר, to trade, go about as a trader, with
the fundamental meaning ἐμπορεύεσθαι (lxx); and also the mention of the
pearls is not wanting here, for at all events the meaning "pearls" has
blended itself with פּנינים, which is a favourite word in the Mashal
poetry, though it be not the original meaning of the word. In 14b כּסף
is surpassed by חרוּץ (besides in the Proverbs, found only in this
meaning in [Psa 68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014).md), which properly
means ore found in a mine, from חרץ, to cut in, to dig up, and hence the
poetic name of gold, perhaps of gold dug out as distinguished from
molten gold. Hitzig regards χρυσός as identical with it; but this word
(Sanskr. without the ending hir, Zench. zar) is derived from ghar, to
glitter (vid., Curtius). תּבוּאתהּ we have translated "gain," for it
does not mean the profit which wisdom brings, the tribute which it
yields, but the gain, the possession of wisdom herself.

[Pro 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015.md)

As regards פּנינים, for which the Kethb has פּניּים, the following
things are in favour of the fundamental meaning "corals," viz.: (1.) The
name itself, which corresponds with the Arab. fann; this word,
proceeding from the root-idea of shooting forth, particularly after the
manner of plants, means the branch and all that raises or multiplies
itself branch-like or twig-like (Fleischer). (2.) The redness attributed
to the פנינים, [Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md), in
contradistinction to the pure whiteness attributed to snow and milk
(vid., at [Job 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#018).md). The meaning of
the word may, however, have become generalized in practice (lxx in loc.
λίθων πολετελῶν, Graec. Venet. λιθιδίων); the meaning "pearls," given to
it in the Job-Targum by Rashi, and particularly by Bochart, lay so much
the nearer as one may have wrought also corals and precious stones, such
as the carbuncle, sardius, and sapphire, into the form of pearls. יקרה,
in consequence of the retrogression of the tone, has Munach on the
penult., and that as an exception, as has been remarked by the Masora,
since in substantives and proper names terminating in ה the נסוג אחור,
i.e., the receding of the tone, does not elsewhere appear, e.g., יפה
היא, [Gen 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#014.md), בּרה היא, [Sol
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md), צרה היא, [Jer
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007.md). חפץ is first abstr., a being
inclined to something, lust, will, pleasure in anything, then also
concr., anything in which one has pleasure, what is beautiful, precious;
cf. Arab. nfı̂s, \_hyy, hence hjârt nfı̂st, precious stones" (Fleischer).
שׁוה with ב means to be an equivalent (purchase-price, exchange) for
anything; the most natural construction in Arab. as well as in Hebr. is
that with ל, to be the equivalent of a thing (vid., at [Job
33:27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027).md); the ב is the Beth pretii, as
if one said in Arab.: biabi anta thou art in the estimate of my father,
I give it for thee. One distinctly perceives in [Pro
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014.md), [Pro
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015.md), the echo of Job 28. This
tetrastich occurs again with a slight variation at [Pro
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#010.md). The Talmud and the Midrash
accent it so, that in the former the expression is וכל־חפצים, and in the
latter וכל־חפציך, and they explain the latter of precious stones and
pearls (אבנים טובות ומרגליות).

[Proverbs 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 3:16</span></span>

That wisdom is of such incomparable value is here confirmed:

16 Length of days is in her right hand;

In her left, riches and honour.

17 Her ways are pleasant ways,

And all her paths are peace.

18 A tree of life is she to those that lay hold upon her,

And he who always holdeth her fast is blessed.

As in the right hand of Jahve, according to [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md), are pleasures for evermore, so
Wisdom holds in her right hand "length of days," viz., of the days of
life, thus life, the blessing of blessings; in her left, riches and
honour ([Pro 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#018).md), the two good
things which, it is true, do not condition life, but, received from
Wisdom, and thus wisely, elevate the happiness of life-in the right hand
is the chief good, in the left the προσθήκη, [Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033.md). Didymus: Per sapientiae dextram
divinarum rerum cognitio, ex qua immortalitatis vita oritur,
significatur; per sinistram autem rerum humanarum notitia, ex qua gloria
opumque abundantia nascitur. The lxx, as between 15a and 15b, so also
here after [Pro 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md), interpolate two
lines: "From her mouth proceedeth righteousness; justice and mercy she
bears upon her tongue," - perhaps translated from the Hebr., but
certainly added by a reader.

[Pro 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017.md)

דּרכי־נעם are ways on which one obtains what is agreeable to the inner
and the outer man, and which it does good to enjoy. The parallel שׁלום
is not a genitive to נתיבות to be supplied; that paths of Wisdom are
themselves שׁלום, for she brings well-being on all sides and deep
inwards satisfaction (peace). In regard to נתיבה, via eminens, elata,
Schultens is right (vid., under [Pro
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015).md);

(Note: The root is not תב, to grope, but נת; whence Arab. natt, to
bubble up, natâ, to raise oneself, to swell up, etc.)

נתיבותיה has Munach, and instead of the Metheg, Tarcha, vid., under [Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md). The figure of the tree of life
the fruit of which brings immortality, is, as [Pro
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030.md); [Pro
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004.md) (cf. [Pro
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012).md), [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md), taken from the history of
paradise in the Book of Genesis. The old ecclesiastical saying, Lignum
vitae crux Christi, accommodates itself in a certain measure, through
[Mat 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019.md); [Luk
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049.md), with this passage of the Book
of Proverbs. החזיק ב means to fasten upon anything, more fully expressed
in [Gen 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#018.md), to bind the hand firm
with anything, to seize it firmly. They who give themselves to Wisdom,
come to experience that she is a tree of life whose fruit contains and
communicates strength of life, and whoever always keeps fast hold of
Wisdom is blessed, i.e., to be pronounced happy ([Psa
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003.md), vid., under [Psa
137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008).md). The predicate מאשּׁר, blessed,
refers to each one of the תּמכיה, those who hold her, cf. [Pro
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#016.md); [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009.md). It is the so-called distributive
singular of the predicate, which is freely used particularly in those
cases where the plur. of the subject is a participle (vid., under [Pro
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035).md).

[Proverbs 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 3:19</span></span>

This place of a mediatrix - the speaker here now continues - she had
from the beginning. God's world-creating work was mediated by her:

19 Jahve hath by wisdom founded the earth,

Established the heavens by understanding.

20 By His knowledge the water-floods broke forth,

And the sky dropped down dew.

That wisdom is meant by which God planned the world-idea, and now also
wrought it out; the wisdom in which God conceived the world ere it was
framed, and by which also He gave external realization to His thoughts;
the wisdom which is indeed an attribute of God and a characteristic of
His actions, since she is a property of His nature, and His nature
attests itself in her, but not less, as appears, not from this group of
tetrastichs, but from all that has hitherto been said, and form the
personal testimony, [Pro 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)., of
which it is the praeludium, she goes forth as a divine power to which
God has given to have life in herself. Considered apart from the
connection of these discourses, this group of verses, as little as [Jer
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#002.md); [Psa
104:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024.md), determines regarding the
attributive interpretation; the Jerusalem Targum, I, when it translates,
[Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md), בראשׁית by בּחוּכמא
(בּחוּכמתא), combines [Pro 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md) with
such passages as this before us. יסד (here with the tone thrown back)
properly signifies, like the Arab. wasad, to lay fast, to found, for one
gives to a fact the firm basis of its existence. The parallel Pil. of
כּוּן (Arab. kân, cogn. כהן, see on Isaiah, p. 691) signifies to set up,
to restore; here equivalent to, to give existence.

[Pro 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#020.md)

It is incorrect to understand 20a, with the Targ., of division, i.e.,
separating the water under the firmament from the water above the
firmament; נבקע is spoken of water, especially of its breaking forth,
[Gen 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md); [Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md), cf. [Psa
74:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015.md), properly dividing itself out,
i.e., welling forth from the bowels of the earth; it means, without
distinguishing the primordial waters and the later water-floods confined
within their banks (cf. [Job 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#008.md).,
[Psa 104:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006).md), the overflowing of the
earth for the purpose of its processes of cultivation and the irrigation
of the land. תּהומות (from הוּם = המה, to groan, to roar) are chiefly
the internal water stores of the earth, [Gen
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025.md); [Psa
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007.md). But while 20a is to be
understood of the waters under the firmament, 20b is to be interpreted
of those above. שׁחקים (from שׁחק, Arab. sḥaḳ, comminuere, attenuare)
properly designates the uppermost stratum of air thinly and finely
stretching itself far and wide, and then poetically the clouds of heaven
(vid., under [Psa 77:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#018).md). Another
name, עריפים, comes from ערף, which is transposed from רעף (here used in
20b), Arab. r'af, to drop, to run. The טל added on the object accusative
represents synecdochically all the waters coming down from heaven and
fructifying the earth. This watering proceeds from above (ורעפו); on the
contrary, the endowing of the surface of the earth with great and small
rivers is a fundamental fact in creation (נבקעו).

[Proverbs 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 3:21</span></span>

From this eminence, in which the work of creation presents wisdom,
exhortations are now deduced, since the writer always expresses himself
only with an ethical intention regarding the nature of wisdom:

21 My son, may they not depart from thine eyes -

Preserve thoughtfulness and consideration,

22 And they will be life to thy soul

And grace to thy neck.

If we make the synonyms of wisdom which are in 21b the subject per
prolepsin to אל־ילזוּ (Hitzig and Zckler), then [Pro
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019.md) and [Pro
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021.md) clash. The subjects are
wisdom, understanding, knowledge, which belong to God, and shall from
His become the possession of those who make them their aim. Regarding
לוּז, obliquari, deflectere, see under [Pro
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015.md), cf. [Pro
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#021.md); regarding תּשׁיּה (here
defective after the Masora, as rightly in Vened. 1515, 1521, and Nissel,
1662), see at [Pro 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007.md); ילזוּ for
תּלזנה, see at [Pro 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002.md). The lxx (cf.
[Heb 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001).md) translate without
distinctness of reference: υἱὲ μὴ παραῤῥυῂς (παραρυῇς), let it now flow
past, i.e., let it not be unobserved, hold it always before thee; the
Targ. with the Syr. render לא נזּל, ne vilescat, as if the words were
אל־יזוּלוּ. In 22a the synallage generis is continued: ויהיוּ for
ותהיינה. Regarding גּרגּרת, see at [Pro
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009.md). By wisdom the soul gains life,
divinely true and blessed, and the external appearance of the man grace,
which makes him pleasing and gains for him affection.

[Proverbs 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 3:23</span></span>

But more than this, wisdom makes its possessor in all situations of life
confident in God:

23 Then shalt thou go thy way with confidence,

And thy foot shall not stumble.

24 When thou liest down, thou are not afraid,

But thou layest thyself down and hast sweet sleep.

25 Thou needest not be afraid of sudden alarm,

Nor for the storm of the wicked when it breaketh forth.

26 For Jahve will be thy confidence

And keep thy foot from the snare.

The לבטח (cf. our "bei guter Laune" = in good cheer), with ל of the
condition, is of the same meaning as the conditional adverbial
accusative בּטח, [Pro 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009.md); [Pro
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#033.md). [Pro
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#023.md) the lxx translate ὁ δὲ πούς σου
οὐ μὴ προσκόψῃ, while, on the contrary, at [Psa
91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md) they make the person the subject
(μήποτε προσκόψῃς τὸν κ.τ.λ.); here also we retain more surely the
subject from 23a, especially since for the intrans. of נגף (to smite, to
push) a Hithpa. התנגּף is used [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016.md). In [Pro
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#024.md) there is the echo of [Job
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#018.md), and in [Pro
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#025.md) of [Job
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#021.md). [Pro
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#024.md) is altogether the same as [Job
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#024.md) : et decumbes et suavis erit
somnus tuus = si decubueris, suavis erit. The hypothetic perf.,
according to the sense, is both there and at [Job
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#018.md) (cf. [Jer
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009).md) oxytoned as perf. consec.
Similar examples are [Pro 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#022.md); [Gen
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#013.md); [Sa1
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#031.md), cf. Ewald, 357a. ערבה (of sleep
as [Jer 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#026).md) is from ערב, which in
Hebr. is used of pleasing impressions, as the Arab. ‛ariba of a lively,
free disposition. שׁנה, somnus (nom. actionis from ישׁן, with the
ground-form sina preserved in the Arab. lidat, vid., Job, p. 284, note),
agrees in inflexion with שׁנה, annus. אל, [Pro
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#025.md), denies, like [Psa
121:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003.md), with emphasis: be afraid only
not = thou hast altogether nothing to fear. Schultens rightly says:
Subest species prohibitionis et tanquam abominationis, ne tale quicquam
vel in suspicionem veniat in mentemve cogitando admittatur. פּחד here
means terror, as [Pro 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026.md)., the
terrific object; פּתאם (with the accus. om) is the virtual genitive, as
[Pro 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002) חנּם (with accus. am.md).
Regarding שׁאה, see under [Pro 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027.md).
The genitive רשׁעים may be, after [Psa
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#018.md), the genit. subjecti, but still
it lies nearer to say that he who chooses the wisdom of God as his
guiding star has no ground to fear punishment as transgressors have
reason to fear it; the שׁאה is meant which wisdom threatens against
transgressors, [Pro 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027.md). He needs
have no fear of it, for wisdom is a gift of God, and binds him who
receives it to the giver: Jahve becomes and is henceforth his
confidence. Regarding ב essentiae, which expresses the closest
connection of the subject with the predicate which it introduces, see
under [Psa 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002.md). As here, so also at
[Exo 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#004.md); [Psa
118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007.md); [Psa
146:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md), the predicate is a noun with a
pronominal suffix. כּסל is, as at [Psa
78:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#007.md); [Job
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024.md), cognate to מבטה and מקוה,

(Note: According to Malbim, תּקוה is the expectation of good, and כּסל,
confidence in the presence of evil.)

the object and ground of confidence. That the word in other connections
may mean also fool-hardiness, [Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md), and folly, [Ecc
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025.md) (cf. regarding כּסיל, which in
Arab. as belı̂d denotes the dull, in Hebr. fools, see under [Pro
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022).md), it follows that it proceeds
from the fundamental conception of fulness of flesh and of fat, whence
arise the conceptions of dulness and slothfulness, as well as of
confidence, whether confidence in self or in God (see Schultens l.c.,
and Wnsche's Hosea, p. 207f.). לכד is taking, catching, as in a net or
trap or pit, from לכד, to catch (cf. Arab. lakida, to fasten, III, IV to
hold fast); another root-meaning, in which Arab. lak connects itself
with nak, nk, to strike, to assail (whence al-lakdat, the assault
against the enemy, Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitsch. xxii. 140), is foreign to
the Hebr. Regarding the מן of מלכד, Fleischer remarks: "The מן after the
verbs of guarding, preserving, like שׁמר and נצר, properly expresses
that one by those means holds or seeks to hold a person or thing back
from something, like the Lat. defendere, tueri aliquem ab hostibus, a
perculo."

(Note: Hitzig rejects [Pro 3:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022.md) as
a later interpolation. And why? Because chap. 3, which he regards as a
complete discourse, consists of twice ten verses beginning with בּני. In
addition to this symmetry other reasons easily reveal themselves to his
penetration. But the discourses contained in chap. 1-9 do not all begin
with בני (vid., [Pro 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020).md); and when
it stands in the beginning of the discourse, it is not always the first
word (vid., [Pro 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008).md); and when it
occurs as the first word or in the first line, it does not always
commence a new discourse (vid., [Pro
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015.md) in the middle of the first, [Pro
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011) in the middle of the fourth.md);
and, moreover, the Hebr. poetry and oratory does not reckon according to
verses terminated by Soph Pasuk, which are always accented distichs, but
they in reality frequently consist of three or more lines. The rejected
verses are in nothing unlike those that remain, and which are
undisputed; they show the same structure of stichs, consisting for the
most part of three, but sometimes also only of two words (cf. [Pro
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022.md) with [Pro
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009.md), [Pro
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010).md), the same breadth in the course
of the thoughts, and the same accord with Job and Deuteronomy.)

[Proverbs 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 3:27</span></span>

The first illustration of neighbourly love which is recommended, is
readiness to serve:

27 Refuse no manner of good to him to whom it is due

When it is in thy power to do it.

28 Say not to thy neighbour, "Go, and come again,

To-morrow I will give it," whilst yet thou hast it.

Regarding the intensive plur. בּעליו with a sing. meaning, see under
[Pro 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019.md). The form of expression
without the suffix is not בּעלי but בּעל טוב; and this denotes here, not
him who does good (בעל as Arab. dhw or ṣaḥab), but him to whom the good
deed is done (cf. [Pro 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008).md), i.e., as
here, him who is worthy of it (בעל as Arab. âhl), him who is the man for
it (Jewish interp.: מי שׁהוא ראוי לו). We must refuse nothing good
(nothing either legally or morally good) to him who has a right to it
(מנע מן as [Job 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#007.md); [Job
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#016).md),

(Note: Accentuate אל־תמנע טוב, not אל־תמנע־טוב. The doubling of the
Makkeph is purposeless, and, on the contrary, the separating of טוב from
מבעליו by the Dechi (the separating accent subordinate to Athnach) is
proper. It is thus in the best MSS.)

if we are in a condition to do him this good. The phrase ישׁ־לאל ידי,
[Gen 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029.md), and frequently, signifies:
it is belonging to (practicable) the power of my hand, i.e., I have the
power and the means of doing it. As זד signifies the haughty, insolent,
but may be also used in the neuter of insolent conduct (vid., [Psa
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014).md), so אל signifies the strong,
but also (although only in this phrase) strength. The Keri rejects the
plur. ידיך, because elsewhere the hand always follows לאל in the
singular. But it rejects the plur. לרעיך ([Pro
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#028).md) because the address following is
directed to one person. Neither of these emendations was necessary. The
usage of the language permits exceptions, notwithstanding the usus
tyrannus, and the plur. לרעיך may be interpreted distributively: to thy
fellows, it may be this one or that one. Hitzig also regards לרעיך as a
singular; but the masc. of רעיה, the ground-form of which is certainly
ra‛j, is רעה, or shorter, רע. לך ושׁוּב does not mean: forth! go home
again! but: go, and come again. שׁוּב, to come again, to return to
something, to seek it once more.

(Note: Thus also (Arab.) raj' is used in Thaalebi's Confidential
Companion, p. 24, line 3, of Flgel's ed. Admission was prevented to one
Haschmid, then angry he sought it once more; he was again rejected, then
he sought it not again (Arab. flm yraj'), but says, etc. Flgel has
misunderstood the passage. Fleischer explains raj', with reference to
[Pro 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#028), by revenir la charge..md)

The ו of ישׁו אתּך is, as 29b, the conditional: quum sit penes te, sc.
quod ei des. "To-morrow shall I give" is less a promise than a delay and
putting off, because it is difficult for him to alienate himself from
him who makes the request. This holding fast by one's own is unamiable
selfishness; this putting off in the fulfilment of one's duty is a sin
of omission - οὐ γὰρ οἶδας, as the lxx adds, τὶ τέξεται ἡ ἐπιοῦσα.

[Proverbs 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 3:29</span></span>

A second illustration of neighbourly love is harmlessness:

Devise not evil against thy neighbour,

While he dwelleth securely by thee.

The verb חרשׁ, χαράσσειν, signifies to cut into, and is used of the
faber ferrarius as well as of the τιγναριυς (Isaiah, p. 463), who with a
cutting instrument (חרשׁ, [Gen 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#022).md)
works with metal or wood, and from his profession is called חרשׁ. But
the word means as commonly to plough, i.e., to cut with the plough, and
חרשׁ is used also of a ploughman, and, without any addition to it, it
always has this meaning. It is then a question whether the metaphorical
phrase רעה חרשׁ signifies to fabricate evil, cf. dolorum faber, mendacia
procudere, ψευδῶν καὶ ἀπατῶν τέκτων, and the Homeric κακὰ φρεὶ
βυσσοδομεύειν (Fleischer and most others), or to plough evil (Rashi,
Ewald, etc.). The Targ., Syriac, and Jerome translate חשׁב, without
deciding the point, by moliri; but the lxx and Graecus Venet. by
τεκταίνειν. The correctness of these renderings is not supported by
Ezek. 21:36, where חרשׁי משׁחית are not such as fabricate destruction,
but smiths who cause destruction; also מחרישׁ, [Sa1
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009.md), proves nothing, and probably
does not at all appertain to חרשׁ incidere (Keil), but to חרשׁ silere,
in the sense of dolose moliri. On the one hand, it is to be observed
from [Job 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008.md); [Hos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013.md), cf. [Psa
129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003.md), that the meaning arare malum
might connect itself with חרשׁ רעה; and the proverb of Sirach 7:12, μὴ
ἀροτρία ψεῦδος ἐπ ̓ ἀδελφῷ σου, places this beyond a doubt. Therefore in
this phrase, if one keeps before him a clear perception of the figure,
at one time the idea of fabricating, at another that of ploughing, is
presented before us. The usage of the language in the case before us is
more in favour of the latter than of the former. Whether ישׁב את means
to dwell together with, or as Bttcher, to sit together with, after [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md); [Psa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004.md)., need not be a matter of
dispute. It means in general a continued being together, whether as
sitting, [Job 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md), or as dwelling,
[Jdg 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#011.md).

(Note: Accentuate והוא־יושׁב לבטח. It is thus in correct texts. The
Rebia Mugrash is transformed, according to the Accentuationssystem,
xviii. 2.)

To take advantage of the regardlessness of him who imparts to us his
confidence is unamiable. Love is doubly owing to him who resigns himself
to it because he believes in it.

[Proverbs 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 3:30</span></span>

A third illustration of the same principle is peaceableness:

Contend not with a man without a cause,

When he has inflicted no evil upon thee.

Instead of תּרוּב, or as the Kerı̂ has amended it תּריב, the abbreviated
form תּרב or תּרב would be more correct after אל; רוּב or ריב (from רב,
to be compact) means to fall upon one another, to come to hand-blows, to
contend. Contending and quarrelling with a man, whoever he may be,
without sufficient reason, ought to be abandoned; but there exists no
such reason if he has done me no harm which I have to reproach him with.
גּמל רעה with the accus. or dat. of the person signifies to bring evil
upon any one, malum inferre, or also referre (Schultens), for גּמל
(cogn. גּמר) signifies to execute, to complete, accomplish - both of the
initiative and of the requital, both of the anticipative and of the
recompensing action; here in the former of these senses.

[Proverbs 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 3:31</span></span>

These exhortations to neighbourly love in the form of warning against
whatever is opposed to it, are followed by the warning against
fellowship with the loveless:

31 Be not envious toward the man of violence,

And have no pleasure in all his ways.

32 For an abhorrence to Jahve is the perverse,

But with the upight is His secret.

The conceptions of jealousy and envy lie in קנּא (derived by Schultens
from קנא, Arab. ḳanâ, intensius rubere) inseparable from each other. The
lxx, which for תקנא reads תקנה (κτήσῃ), brings the envy into 31b, as if
the words here were ואל־תּתחר, as in [Psa
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md), [Psa
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007.md) (there the lxx has μὴ παραζήλου,
here μηδὲ ζηλώσῃς). There is no reason for correcting our text in
accordance with this (substituting תּתחר for תּבחר as Hitzig does),
because בּכל־דּרכיו would be too vague an expression for the object of
the envy, while אל־תבחר altogether agrees with it; and the contrary
remark, that בּחר בּכּל is fundamentally no בחר, fails since (1) בחר
frequently expresses pleasure in anything without the idea of choice,
and (2) "have not pleasure in all his ways" is in the Hebrew style
equivalent to "in any one of his ways;" Ewald, 323b. He who does
"violence to the law" ([Zep 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004).md)
becomes thereby, according to the common course of the world, a person
who is feared, whose authority, power, and resources are increased, but
one must not therefore envy him, nor on any side take pleasure in his
conduct, which in all respects is to be reprobated; for the נלוז,
inflexus, tortuosus (vid., [Pro 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015).md),
who swerves from the right way and goes in a crooked false way, is an
object of Jahve's abhorrence, while, on the contrary, the just, who with
a right mind walks in the right way, is Jahve's סוד - an echo of [Psa
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md). סוד (R. סד, to be firm,
compressed) means properly the being pressed together, or sitting
together (cf. the Arab. wisâd, wisâdt, a cushion, divan, corresponding
in form to the Hebr. יסוד) for the purpose of private communication and
conversation (הוּסד), and then partly the confidential intercourse, as
here (cf. [Job 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#004).md), partly the
private communication, the secret ([Amo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007).md). lxx, ἐν δὲ δικαίοις \[οὐ\]
συνεδριάζει. Those who are out of the way, who prefer to the simplicity
of right-doing all manner of crooked ways, are contrary to God, and He
may have nothing to do with them; but the right-minded He makes
partakers of His most intimate intercourse, He deals with them as His
friends.

[Proverbs 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 3:33</span></span>

The prosperity of the godless, far from being worthy of envy, has as its
reverse side the curse:

The curse of Jahve is in the house of the godless,

And the dwelling of the just He blesseth.

מארה (a curse), like מסלּה (a highway, from סלל), is formed from ארר
(cf. Arab. harr, detestari, abhorrere, a word-imitation of an
interjection used in disagreeable experiences). The curse is not merely
a deprivation of external goods which render life happy, and the
blessing is not merely the fulness of external possessions; the
central-point of the curse lies in continuous disquiet of conscience,
and that of the blessing in the happy consciousness that God is with us,
in soul-rest and peace which is certain of the grace and goodness of
God. The poetic נוה (from נוה = Arab. nwy, tetendit aliquo) signifies
the place of settlement, and may be a word borrowed from a nomad life,
since it denotes specially the pasture-ground; cf. [Pro
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#015) (Fleischer.md). While the curse of
God rests in the house of the wicked (vid., Khler on [Zac
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004).md), He blesses, on the contrary, the
dwelling-place of the righteous. The lxx and Jerome read יברך, but יברך
is more agreeable, since God continues to be the subject.

[Proverbs 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">pro 3:34</span></span>

His relation to men is determined by their relation to Him.

As for the scorners, He scorneth them,

But to the lowly He giveth grace.

Most interpreters render the verse thus: "If the scorner He (even He, in
return) scorneth, so He (on the other hand) giveth grace to the lowly."
For the sequence of the words in the consequence, in which the
precedence of the verb is usual, e.g., [Lev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#005.md), we are referred to [Pro
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#018.md), cf. [Pro
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#014.md); but why had the poet placed the
two facts in the relation of condition and consequence? The one fact is
not the consequence but the reverse of the other, and accordingly they
are opposed to each other in coordinated passages, [Psa
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md). The Vav in such antitheses has
generally the meaning of "and on the other hand," e.g., [Job
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#020.md), while the lxx, Targ., Syriac,
and Jerome altogether pass over the אם as if it did not exist. Ziegler
translates: "Truly! the scorner He scorneth;" but an affirmative אם does
not exist, the asseveration after the manner of an oath is negative.
Bertheau's expedient would be more acceptable, by which he makes the
whole of [Pro 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md) the protasis to
[Pro 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035.md); but if this were intended,
another subject would not enter into [Pro
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035.md). Thus 34a and 34b are two
independent parallel passages; אם־ללּצים is the protasis: if as regards
the scorners, i.e., if His conduct is directed to the scorners, so He
scorneth. The ל denotes relation, and in this elliptical usage is like
the ל of superscription, e.g., [Jer
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md). הוּא is the emphatic αὐτός: He
on the contrary, and in a decisive way (Ewald, 314ab). Instead of יליץ
fo there might have been used יליצם (for הליץ, where it occurs as a
governing word, has the accusative, [Pro
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028.md); [Psa
119:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#051).md), but we do not miss the
object: if it relates to scorners (thus also Lwenstein translates), so
it is He in return who scorneth. The lxx renders it: κύριος ὑπερηφάνοις
ἀντιτάσσεται, ταπεινοῖς δὲ δίδωσι χάριν; cf. [Jam
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md); [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md). הוּא is used as a name of God
(Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr. xvi. 400), on which account it is rendered
like יהוה by κύριος. A ὑπερήφανος (appearing above others, i.e.,
overbearing) is the לץ, according to the definition [Pro
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024.md). the expression of the talio is
generalized in ἀντιτάσσεται (resists them). For עניים the Kerı̂ has
ענוים: ענו (from ענה, the ground-form ענו, Arab. 'anaw) is the lowly
(ταπεινός), or he who bends himself, i.e., the gentle and humble, the
patient, and the passive עני, he who is bowed down, the suffering; but
the limits of the conception are moveable, since in עני is presupposed
the possession of fruit-virtues gained in the school of affliction.

[Proverbs 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">pro 3:35</span></span>

This group of the proverbs of wisdom now suitably closes with the
fundamental contrast between the wise and fools:

The wise shall inherit honour,

But fools carry away shame.

If we take וּכסילים as the object, then we can scarcely interpret the
clause: shame sweeps fools away (Umbreit, Zckler, Bertheau), for הרים
\[Hiph. of רוּם\] signifies ([Isa
57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014.md); [Eze
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#031).md) "to raise up anything high and
far," not "to sweep away." Preferable is the rendering: τοὺς δ ̓ ἄφρονας
ὑψοῖ ἀτιμία (Graec. Venet., and similarly Jerome), i.e., only to it do
they owe their celebrity as warning examples (Ewald), to which Oetinger
compares "whose glory is in their shame," [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md);

(Note: Jona Gerundi renders it otherwise: "But shame raises the fools
high;" i.e., only the infamous, he who has no sense of honour, makes
much advancement out of fools.)

but קלון is the contrary of כּבוד (glory, [Hab
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016).md), and therefore is as much an
object conception as is the latter, 35a. If it is the object, then if we
take מרים from מר after the form of לן, [Neh
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#021.md) = ממירים ([Hos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007).md), it might be rendered: Yet fools
exchange shame (Lwenstein). But מוּר, like the Arab. mrr, transire,
means properly to pass over or to wander over; it is intransitive, and
only in Hiph. signifies actively to exchange. מרים thus will be the
participle of הרים; the plur. taken distributively (fools = whoever is
only always a fool) is connected with the singular of the predicate.
This change in the number is here, however, more difficult than at [Pro
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018.md), and in other places, where the
plur. of the part. permits the resolution into a relative clause with
quicunque, and more difficult than at [Pro
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001.md), where the sing. of the predicate
is introduced by attraction; wherefore מרים may be an error in
transcribing for מרימים or מרימי (Bttcher). J. H. Michaelis (after the
Targ. and Syr.) has properly rendered the clause: "stulti tollunt
ignominiam tanquam portionem suam," adding "quae derivato nomine תרומה
dicitur." הרים signifies, in the language of the sacrificial worship and
of worship generally, to lift off from anything the best portion, the
legitimate portion due to God and the priesthood (vid., at [Pro
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009).md); for which reason Rashi glosses
מרים by מפרישׁ לו, and Ralbag by מגביה לו. See [Pro
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029.md). Honour is that which the wise
inherit, it falls to them unsought as a possession, but fools receive
shame as the offal (viz., of their foolish conduct). The fut. and part.
are significantly interchanged. The life of the wise ends in glory, but
fools inherit shame; the fruit of their conduct is shame and evermore
shame.
