[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

Hallelujah to God the One True Helper

The Psalter now draws to a close with five Hallelujah Psalms. This first
closing Hallelujah has many points of coincidence with the foregoing
alphabetical hymn (compare אחללה in [Psa
146:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#002) with [Psa
145:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#002); שׂברו in [Psa
146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005) with [Psa
145:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015); "who giveth bread to the
hungry" in [Psa 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007) with [Psa
145:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015).; "who maketh the blind to see"
in [Psa 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008) with [Psa
145:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014); "Jahve reigneth, etc.," in
[Psa 146:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#010) with [Psa
145:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#013)) - the same range of thought
betrays one author. In the lxx [Psa
146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001) (according to its enumeration
four Psalms, viz., [Psa 145:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001), Psalms
147 being split up into two) have the inscription Ἀλληλούια. Ἀγγαίου καὶ
Ζαχαρίου, which is repeated four times. These Psalms appear to have
formed a separate Hallel, which is referred back to these prophets, in
the old liturgy of the second Temple. Later on they became, together
with [Psa 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001), an integral part of
the daily morning prayer, and in fact of the פסוקי דזמרה, i.e., of the
mosaic-work of Psalms and other poetical pieces that was incorporated in
the morning prayer, and are called eve in Shabbath 118b Hallel,

(Note: Rashi, however, understands only [Psa
148:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001) and [Psa
150:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001) by פסוקי דזמרה in that
passage.)

but expressly distinguished from the Hallel to be recited at the
Passover and other feasts, which is called "the Egyptian Hallel." In
distinction from this, Krochmal calls these five Psalms the Greek
Hallel. But there is nothing to oblige us to come down beyond the time
of Ezra and Nehemiah. The agreement between 1 Macc. 2:63 (ἔστρεψεν εἰς
τὸν χοῦν αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ διαλογισμὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπώλετο) and [Psa
146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004) of our Psalm, which Hitzig has
turned to good account, does not decide anything concerning the age of
the Psalm, but only shows that it was in existence at the time of the
author of the First Book of Maccabees, - a point in favour of which we
were not in need of any proof. But there was just as much ground for
dissuading against putting confidence in princes in the time of the
Persians as in that of the Grecian domination.

[Psalms 146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 146:1</span></span>

Instead of "bless," as in [Psa 103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001);
[Psa 104:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001), the poet of this Psalm
says "praise." When he attunes his sole to the praise of God, he puts
himself personally into this mood of mind, and therefore goes on to say
"I will praise." He will, however, not only praise God in the song which
he is beginning, but כּחיּי (vid., on [Psa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005)), fillling up his life with it,
or בּעודי (prop. "in my yet-being," with the suffix of the noun, whereas
עודנּי with the verbal suffix is "I still am"), so that his continued
life is also a constant continued praising, viz., (and this is in the
mind of the poet here, even at the commencment of the Psalm) of the God
and Kings who, as being the Almighty, Eternal, and unchangeably Faithful
One, is the true ground of confidence. The warning against putting trust
in princes calls to mind [Psa 118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008).
The clause: the son of man, who has no help that he could afford, is to
be understood according to Ps 60:13. The following לאדמתו shows that the
poet by expression בּן־אדם combines the thoughts of [Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007) and [Gen
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019). If his breath goes forth, he
says, basing the untrustworthiness and feebleness of the son of Adam
upon the inevitable final destiny of the son of Adam taken out of the
ground, then he returns to his earth, i.e., the earth of his first
beginning; cf. the more exact expression אל־עפרם, after which the εἰς
τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ of the lxx is exchanged for εἰς τὸν χοῦν αὐτοῦ in 1 Macc.
2:63: On the hypothetical relation of the first future clause to the
second, cf. [Psa 139:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008), [Psa
139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018); Ew. 357, b. In that day, the
inevitable day of death, the projects or plans of man are at once and
forever at an end. The ἅπ. λεγ. עשׁתּנת describes these with the
collateral notion of the subtleness and magnitude.

[Psalms 146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 146:5</span></span>

Man's help is of no avail; blessed is he (this is the last of the
twenty-five אשׁרי of the Psalter), on the contrary, who has the God of
Jacob (שׁאל like שׁיהוה in [Psa
144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015)) as Him in whom is his succour
(בּעזרו with Beth essentiae, vid., on [Psa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002)) - he, whose confidence (שׂבר as
in [Psa 119:116](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#116)) rests on Jahve, whom
he can by faith call his God. Men often are not able to give help
although they might be willing to do so: He, however, is the Almighty,
the Creator of the heavens, the earth, and the sea, and of all living
things that fill these three (cf. [Neh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006)). Men easily change their mind and
do not keep their word: He, however, is He who keepeth truth or
faithfulness, inasmuch as He unchangeably adheres to the fulfilling of
His promises. שׁמר אמת is in form equivalent substantially to שׁמר חסד
and שׁמר הבּרית. And that which He is able to do as being the Almighty,
and cannot as being the Truthful One leave undone, is also really His
mode of active manifestation made evident in practical proofs: He
obtains right for the oppressed, gives bread to the hungry, and
consequently proves Himself to be the succour of those who suffer wrong
without doing wrong, and as the provider for those who look for their
daily bread from His gracious hand. With השּׁמר, the only determinate
participle, the faithfulness of God to His promises is made especially
prominent.

[Psalms 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 146:7</span></span>

The five lines beginning with Jahve belong together. Each consists of
three words, which in the main is also the favourite measure of the
lines in the Book of Job. The expression is as brief as possible. התּיר
is transferred from the yoke and chains to the person himself who is
bound, and פּקח is transferred from the eyes of the blind to the person
himself. The five lines celebrate the God of the five-divisioned Tra,
which furnishes abundant examples for these celebrations, and is
directed with most considerate tenderness towards the strangers,
orphans, and widows in particular. The orphan and the widow, says the
sixth line, doth He recover, strengthen (with reference to עודד see [Psa
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009); [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012)). Valde gratus mihi est hic
Psalmus, Bakius observes, ob Trifolium illud Dei: Advenas, Pupillos, et
Viduas, versu uno luculentissime depictum, id quod in toto Psalterio
nullibi fit. Whilst Jahve, however, makes the manifold sorrows of His
saints to have a blessed issue, He bends (יאוּת) the way of the wicked,
so that it leads into error and ends in the abyss ([Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006)). This judicial manifestation of
Jahve has only one line devoted to it. For He rules in love and in
wrath, but delights most of all to rule in love. Jahve is, however, the
God of Zion. The eternal duration of His kingdom is also the guarantee
for its future glorious completion, for the victory of love. Hallelujah!
