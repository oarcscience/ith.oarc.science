### [Hosea Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 9:1</span></span>

Warning against false security. The earthly prosperity of the people and
kingdom was no security against destruction. Because Israel had fallen
away from its God, it should not enjoy the blessing of its
field-produce, but should be carried away to Assyria, where it would be
unable to keep any joyful feasts at all. [Hos
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md). "Rejoice not, O Israel, to exult
like the nations: for thou hast committed whoredom against thy God: hast
loved the wages of whoredom upon all corn-floors. [Hos
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#002.md). The threshing-floor and press
will not feed them, and the new wine will deceive it." The rejoicing to
which Israel was not to give itself up was, according to [Hos
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#002.md), rejoicing at a plentiful harvest.
All nations rejoiced, and still rejoice, at this (cf. [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002).md), because they regard the blessing
of harvest as a sign and pledge of the favour and grace of God, which
summon them to gratitude towards the giver. Now, when the heathen
nations ascribed their fights to their gods, and in their way thanked
them for them, they did this in the ignorance of their heart, without
being specially guilty on that account, since they lived in the world
without the light of divine revelation. But when Israel rejoiced in a
heathenish way at the blessing of its harvest, and attributed this
blessing to the Baals (see [Hos 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#007).md),
the Lord could not leave this denial of His gracious benefits
unpunished. אל־גּיל belongs to תּשׂמח, heightening the idea of joy, as
in [Job 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#022.md). כּי זנית does not give
the object of the joy ("that thou hast committed whoredom:" Ewald and
others), but the reason why Israel was not to rejoice over its harvests,
namely, because it had become unfaithful to its God, and had fallen into
idolatry. זנה מעל, to commit whoredom out beyond God (by going away from
Him). The words, "thou lovest the wages of whoredom upon all
corn-floors," are to be understood, according to [Hos
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#007.md), [Hos
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014.md), as signifying that Israel would
not regard the harvest-blessing upon its corn-floors as gifts of the
goodness of its God, but as presents from the Baals, for which it had to
serve them with still greater zeal. There is no ground for thinking of
any peculiar form of idolatry connected with the corn-floors. Because of
this the Lord would take away from them the produce of the floor and
press, namely, according to [Hos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md),
by banishing the people out of the land. Floor and press will not feed
them, i.e., will not nourish or satisfy them. The floor and press are
mentioned in the place of their contents, or what they yield, viz., for
corn and oil, as in [Kg2 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#027.md). By the
press we must understand the oil-presses (cf. [Joe
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#024).md), because the new wine is
afterwards specially mentioned, and corn, new wine, and oil are
connected together in [Hos 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#010.md), 24.
The suffix בּהּ refers to the people regarded as a community.

[Hosea 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 9:3</span></span>

"They will not remain in the land of Jehovah: Ephraim returns to Egypt,
and they will eat unclean things in the land of Asshur. [Hos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004.md). They will not pour out wine to
Jehovah, and their slain-offerings will not please Him: like bread of
mourning are they to Him; all who eat it become unclean: for their bread
is for themselves, it does not come into the house of Jehovah." Because
they have fallen away from Jehovah, He will drive them out of His land.
The driving away is described as a return to Egypt, as in [Hos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md); but Asshur is mentioned
immediately afterwards as the actual land of banishment. That this
threat is not to be understood as implying that they will be carried
away to Egypt as well as to Assyria, but that Egypt is referred to here
and in [Hos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md), just as in [Hos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md), simply as a type of the land of
captivity, so that Assyria is represented as a new Egypt, may be clearly
seen from the words themselves, in which eating unclean bread in Assyria
is mentioned as the direct consequence of their return to Egypt; whereas
neither here nor in [Hos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md) is their
being carried away to Assyria mentioned at all; but, on the contrary, in
[Hos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md), Egypt only is introduced as
the place where they are to find their grave. This is still more evident
from the fact that Hosea throughout speaks of Asshur alone, as the rod
of the wrath of God for His rebellious people. The king of Asshur is
king Jareb (striver), to whom Ephraim goes for help, and by whom it will
be put to shame ([Hos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md); [Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006).md); and it is from the Assyrian
king Salman that devastation and destruction proceed ([Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014).md). And, lastly, it is expressly
stated in [Hos 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md), that Israel will
not return to Egypt, but to Asshur, who will be its king. By the
allusion to Egypt, therefore, the carrying away to Assyria is simply
represented as a state of bondage and oppression, resembling the sojourn
of Israel in Egypt in the olden time, or else the threat contained in
[Deu 28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068.md) is simply transferred to
Ephraim. They will eat unclean things in Assyria, not only inasmuch as
when, under the oppression of their heathen rulers, they will not be
able to observe the laws of food laid down in the law, or will be
obliged to eat unclean things from simple want and misery; but also
inasmuch as all food, which was not sanctified to the Lord by the
presentation of the first-fruits, was unclean food to Israel
(Hengstenberg). In Assyria these offerings would cease with the whole of
the sacrificial ritual; and the food which was clean in itself would
thereby become unclean outside the land of Jehovah (cf. [Eze
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#013).md). This explanation of טמא is
required by [Hos 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004.md), in which a
further reason is assigned for the threat. For what we have there is not
a description of the present attitude of Israel towards Jehovah, but a
picture of the miserable condition of the people in exile. The verbs are
pure futures. In Assyria they will neither be able to offer wine to the
Lord as a drink-offering, nor such slain-offerings as we well-pleasing
to Him. For Israel could only offer sacrifices to its God at the place
where He made known His name by revelation, and therefore not in exile,
where He had withdrawn His gracious presence from it. The
drink-offerings are mentioned, as pars pro toto, in the place of all the
meat-offerings and drink-offerings, i.e., of the bloodless gifts, which
were connected with the zebhâchı̄m, or burnt-offerings and
thank-offerings (shelâmı̄m, [Num
15:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#002.md), [Num
15:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#028).md), and could never be omitted
when the first-fruits were offered ([Lev
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#013.md), [Lev
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#018).md). "Their sacrifices:" zibhchēhem
belongs to יערבוּ־לו (shall be pleasing to Him), notwithstanding the
previous segholta, because otherwise the subject to יערבו would be
wanting, and there is evidently quite as little ground for supplying
נס'כיהם from the preceding clause, as Hitzig proposes, as for assuming
that ערב here means to mix. Again, we must not infer from the words,
"their slain-offerings will not please Him," that the Israelites offered
sacrifices when in exile. The meaning is simply that the sacrifices,
which they might wish to offer to Jehovah there, would not be
well-pleasing to Him. We must not repeat זבחיהם as the subject to the
next clause להם ... כּלחם, in the sense of "their sacrifices will be to
them like mourners' bread," which would give no suitable meaning; for
though the sacrifices are called bread of God, they are never called the
bread of men. The subject may be supplied very readily from kelechem
(like bread) thus: their bread, or food, would be to them like mourners'
bread; and the correctness of this is proved by the explanatory clause,
"for their bread," etc. Lechem 'ōnı̄m, bread of affliction, i.e., of
those who mourn for the dead (cf. [Deu
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014).md), in other words, the bread
eaten at funeral meals. This was regarded as unclean, because the corpse
defiled the house, and all who came in contact with it, for seven days
([Num 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#014).md). Their bread would
resemble bread of this kind, because it had not been sanctified by the
offering of the first-fruits. "For their bread will not come into the
house of Jehovah," viz., to be sanctified, "for their souls," i.e., to
serve for the preservation of their life.

[Hosea 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 9:5</span></span>

Their misery will be felt still more keenly on the feast-days. [Hos
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#005.md). "What will ye do on the day of
the festival, and on the day of the feast of Jehovah? [Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md). For behold they have gone away
because of the desolation: Egypt will gather them together, Memphis bury
them: their valuables in silver, thistles will receive them; thorns in
their tents." As the temple and ritual will both be wanting in their
exile, they will be unable to observe any of the feasts of the Lord. No
such difference can be shown to exist between yōm mō‛ēd and yōm chag
Yehōvâh, as would permit of our referring mō‛ēd to feasts of a different
kind from chag. In Leviticus 23, all the feasts recurring at a fixed
period, on which holy meetings were held, including the Sabbath, are
called מועדי יהוהּ; and even though the three feasts at which Israel was
to appear before the Lord, viz., the passover, pentecost, and the feast
of tabernacles, are described as chaggı̄m in [Exo
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#018.md)., every other joyous festival is
also called a chag ([Exo 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#005.md); [Jdg
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019).md). It is therefore just as
arbitrary on the part of Grotius and Rosenmller to understand by mō‛ēd
the three yearly pilgrim-festivals, and by chag Yehōvâh all the rest of
the feasts, including the new moon, as it is on the part of Simson to
restrict the last expression to the great harvest-feast, i.e., the feast
of tabernacles ([Lev 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md), [Lev
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#041).md). The two words are synonymous,
but they are so arranged that by chag the idea of joy is brought into
greater prominence, and the feast-day is thereby designated as a day of
holy joy before Jehovah; whereas mō‛ēd simply expresses the idea of a
feast established by the Lord, and sanctified to Him (see at [Lev
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002).md). By the addition of the chag
Yehōvâh, therefore, greater emphasis is given to the thought, viz., that
along with the feasts themselves all festal joy will also vanish. The
perfect הלכוּ ([Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006).md) may be
explained from the fact, that the prophet saw in spirit the people
already banished from the land of the Lord. הלך, to go away out of the
land. Egypt is mentioned as the place of banishment, in the same sense
as in [Hos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md). There will they all
find their graves. קבּץ in combination with קבּר is the gathering
together of the dead for a common burial, like אסף in [Eze
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005.md); [Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md); [Jer
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#033.md). מף, or נף, as in [Isa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md); [Jer
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016.md); [Jer
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md); [Eze
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013.md), [Eze
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#016.md), probably contracted from מנף,
answers rather to the Coptic Membe, Memphe, than to the old Egyptian
Men-nefr, i.e., mansio bona, the profane name of the city of Memphis,
the ancient capital of Lower Egypt, the ruins of which are to be seen on
the western bank of the Nile, to the south of Old Cairo. The sacred name
of this city was Ha-ka-ptah, i.e., house of the worship of Phtah (see
Brugsch, Geogr. Inschriften, i. pp. 234-5). In their own land thorns and
thistles would take the place of silver valuables. The suffix attached
to יירשׁם refers, ad sensum, to the collective מחמד לכספּם, the
valuables in silver. These are not "silver idols," as Hitzig imagines,
but houses ornamented and filled with the precious metal, as בּאהליהם in
the parallel clause clearly shows. The growth of thorns and thistles
presupposes the utter desolation of the abodes of men ([Isa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013).md).

[Hosea 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 9:7</span></span>

"The days of visitation are come, the days of retribution are come;
Israel will learn: a fool the prophet, a madman the man of spirit, for
the greatness of thy guilt, and the great enmity. [Hos
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008.md). A spy is Ephraim with my God: the
prophet a snare of the bird-catcher in all his ways, enmity in the house
of his God. [Hos 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009.md). They have acted
most corruptly, as in the days of Gibeah: He remembers their iniquity,
visits their sins." The perfects in [Hos
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md) are prophetic. The time of
visitation and retribution is approaching. Then will Israel learn that
its prophets, who only predicted prosperity and good ([Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010).md), were infatuated fools. אויל
וגו introduces, without kı̄, what Israel will experience, as in [Hos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#002.md); [Amo
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012.md). It does not follow, from the use
of the expression 'ı̄sh rūăch, that the reference is to true prophets.
'Ish rūăch (a man of spirit) is synonymous with the 'ı̄sh hōlēkh rūăch (a
man walking in the spirit) mentioned in [Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md) as prophesying lies, and may be
explained from the fact, that even the false prophets stood under the
influence of a superior demoniacal power, and were inspired by a rūăch
sheqer ("a lying spirit," [Kg1 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022).md).
The words which follow, viz., "a fool is the prophet," etc., which
cannot possibly mean, that men have treated, despised, and persecuted
the prophets as fools and madmen, are a decisive proof that the
expression does not refer to true prophets. על רב עונך is attached to
the principal clauses, השּׁלּם ... בּאוּ. The punishment and retribution
occur because of the greatness of the guilt of Israel. In ורבּה the
preposition על continues in force, but as a conjunction: "and because
the enmity is great" (cf. Ewald, 351, a). Mastēmâh, enmity, not merely
against their fellow-men generally, but principally against God and His
servants the true prophets. This is sustained by facts in [Hos
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008.md). The first clause, which is a
difficult one and has been interpreted in very different ways, "spying
is Ephraim עם אלהי" (with or by my God), cannot contain the thought that
Ephraim, the tribe, is, according to its true vocation, a watchman for
the rest of the people, whose duty it is to stand with the Lord upon the
watch-tower and warn Israel when the Lord threatens punishment and
judgment (Jerome, Schmidt); for the idea of a prophet standing with
Jehovah upon a watch-tower is not only quite foreign to the Old
Testament, but irreconcilable with the relation in which the prophets
stood to Jehovah. The Lord did indeed appoint prophets as watchmen to
His people ([Eze 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017).md); but He does
take His own stand upon the watch-tower with them. Tsâphâh in this
connection, where prophets are spoken of both before and after, can only
denote the eager watching on the part of the prophets for divine
revelations, as in [Hab 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md), and not
their looking out for help; and עם אלהי cannot express their fellowship
or agreement with God, if only on account of the suffix "my God," in
which Hosea contrasts the true God as His own, with the God of the
people. The thought indicated would require אלהיו, a reading which is
indeed met with in some codices, but is only a worthless conjecture. עם
denotes outward fellowship here: "with" = by the side of. Israel looks
out for prophecies or divine revelations with the God of the prophet,
i.e., at the side of Jehovah; in other words, it does not follow or
trust its own prophets, who are not inspired by Jehovah. These are like
snares of a bird-catcher in its road, i.e., they cast the people
headlong into destruction. נביא stands at the head, both collectively
and absolutely. In all its ways there is the trap of the bird-catcher:
i.e., all its projects and all that it does will only tend to ensnare
the people. Hostility to Jehovah and His servants the true prophets, is
in the house of the God of the Israelites, i.e., in the temple erected
for the calf-worship; a fact of which Amos ([Amo
7:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010).md) furnishes a practical
example. Israel has thereby fallen as deeply into abomination and sins
as in the days of Gibeah, i.e., as at the time when the abominable
conduct of the men of Gibeah in connection with the concubine of a
Levite took place, as related in Judg. 19ff., in consequence of which
the tribe of Benjamin was almost exterminated. The same depravity on the
part of Israel will be equally punished by the Lord now (cf. [Hos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013).md).

[Hosea 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 9:10</span></span>

[Hos 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md). "I found Israel like grapes
in the desert, I saw your fathers like early fruit on the fig-tree in
the first shooting; but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated
themselves to shame, and became abominations like their lover." Grapes
in the desert and early figs are pleasant choice fruits to whoever finds
them. This figure therefore indicates the peculiar pleasure which
Jehovah found in the people of Israel when He led them out of Egypt, or
the great worth which they had in His eyes when He chose them for the
people of His possession, and concluded a covenant with them at Sinai
(Theod., Cyr.). Bammidbâr (in the desert) belongs, so far as its
position is concerned, to ‛ănâbhı̄m: grapes in the dry, barren desert,
where you do not expect to find such refreshing fruit; but, so far as
the fact is concerned, it also refers to the place in which Israel was
thus found by God, since you can only find fruit in the desert when you
are there yourself. The words, moreover, evidently refer to [Deu
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md) ("I found him Israel in the
wilderness," etc.), and point implicite to the helpless condition in
which Israel was when God first adopted it. The suffix to berē'shı̄thâh
(at her beginning) refers to תּאנה, the first-fruit, which the fig-tree
bears in its first time, at the first shooting. But Israel no longer
answered to the good pleasure of God. They came to Baal-peor. בּעל־פּעור
without the preposition אל is not the idol of that name, but the place
where it was worshipped, which was properly called Beth-peor or Peor
(see at [Num 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028.md) and [Num
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003).md). ינּזרוּ is chosen instead of
יצּמד ([Num 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003.md), [Num
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#005).md), to show that Israel ought to
have consecrated itself to Jehovah, to have been the nazir of Jehovah.
Bōsheth (shame) is the name given to the idol of Baal-peor (cf. [Jer
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024).md), the worship of which was a
shame to Israel. 'Ohabh, the paramour, is also Baal-peor. Of all the
different rebellions on the part of Israel against Jehovah, the prophet
singles out only the idolatry with Baal-peor, because the principal sin
of the ten tribes was Baal-worship in its coarser or more refined forms.

[Hosea 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 9:11</span></span>

It is very evident that this is what he has in his mind, and that he
regards the apostasy of the ten tribes as merely a continuation of that
particular idolatry, from the punishment which is announced in [Hos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md), [Hos
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012.md), as about to fall upon Ephraim in
consequence. [Hos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md). "Ephraim, its
glory will fly away like a bird; no birth, and no pregnancy, and no
conception. [Hos 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012.md). Yea, though
they bring up their sons, I make them bereft, without a man; for woe to
them when I depart from them!" The glory which God gave to His people
through great multiplication, shall vanish away. The licentious worship
of luxury will be punished by the diminution of the numbers of the
people, by childlessness, and the destruction of the youth that may have
grown up. מלּדה, so that there shall be no bearing. בּטן, the womb, for
pregnancy or the fruit of the womb. Even (kı̄ emphatic) if the sons (the
children) grow up, God will make them bereft, מאדם, so that there shall
be no men there. The grown-up sons shall be swept away by death, by the
sword (cf. [Deu 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#025).md). The last
clause gives the reason for the punishment threatened. גּם adds force;
it usually stands at the head of the sentence, and here belongs to להם:
Yea, woe to them, if I depart from them, or withdraw my favour from
them! שׂוּר stands for סוּר, according to the interchangeableness of שׂ
and ס (Aquila and Vulg.). This view has more to support it than the
supposition that שׂוּר is an error of the pen for שׁוּר (Ewald, Hitzig,
etc.), since שׁוּר, to look, construed with מן, in the sense of to look
away from a person, is never met with, although the meaning is just the
same.

[Hosea 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 9:13</span></span>

The vanishing of the glory of Ephraim is carried out still further in
what follows. [Hos 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#013.md). "Ephraim as I
selected it for a Tyre planted in the valley; so shall Ephraim lead out
its sons to the murderer. [Hos 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#014.md).
Give them, O Jehovah: what shalt Thou give him? Give them a childless
womb and dry breasts." In [Hos 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#013.md)
Ephraim is the object to ראיתי (I have seen), but on account of the
emphasis it is placed first, as in [Hos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md); and ראה with an accusative and ל
dna evi signifies to select anything for a purpose, as in [Gen
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#008.md). The Lord had selected Ephraim
for Himself to be a Tyre planted in the meadow, i.e., in a soil adapted
for growth and prosperity, had intended for it the bloom and glory of
the rich and powerful Tyre; but now, for its apostasy, He would give it
up to desolation, and dedicate its sons, i.e., its people, to death by
the sword. The commentators, for the most part, like the lxx, have
overlooked this meaning of ראה, and therefore have not only been unable
to explain letsōr (for a Tyre), but have been driven either to resort to
alterations of the text, like letsūrâh, "after the form" (Ewald), or to
arbitrary assumptions, e.g., that tsōr signifies "palm" after the Arabic
(Arnold, Hitzig), or that letsōr means "as far as Tyre" (ל = עד), in
order to bring a more or less forced interpretation into the sentence.
The Vav before 'Ephraim introduces the apodosis to כּאשׁר: "as I have
selected Ephraim, so shall Ephraim lead out," etc. On the construction
להוציא, see Ewald, 237, c. In [Hos
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#014.md) the threat rises into an appeal
to God to execute the threatened punishment. The excited style of the
language is indicated in the interpolated mah-titteen (what wilt Thou
give?). The words do not contain an intercessory prayer on the part of
the prophet, that God will not punish the people too severely but
condemn them to barrenness rather than to the loss of the young men
(Ewald), but are expressive of holy indignation at the deep corruption
of the people.

[Hosea 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md)

The Lord thereupon replies in [Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md) : "All their wickedness is at
Gilgal; for there I took them into hatred: for the evil of their doings
will I drive them out of my house, and not love them any more; all their
princes are rebellions." How far all the wickedness of Ephraim was
concentrated at Gilgal it is impossible to determine more precisely,
since we have no historical accounts of the idolatrous worship practised
there (see at [Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md). That Gilgal
was the scene of horrible human sacrifices, as Hitzig observes at [Hos
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md), cannot be proved from [Hos
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md). שׂנא is used here in an
inchoative sense, viz., to conceive hatred. On account of their
wickedness they should be expelled from the house, i.e., the
congregation of Jehovah (see at [Hos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001).md). The expression "I will drive
them out of my house" (mibbēthı̄ 'ăgâreshēm) may be explained from [Gen
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md), where Sarah requests Abraham to
drive (gârash) Hagar her maid out of the house along with her son, that
the son of the maid may not inherit with Isaac, and where God commands
the patriarch to carry out Sarah's will. The expulsion of Israel from
the house of the Lord is separation from the fellowship of the covenant
nation and its blessings, and is really equivalent to loving it no
longer. There is a play upon words in the last clause שׂריהם סוררים.

[Hosea 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 9:16</span></span>

"Ephraim is smitten: their root is dried up; they will bear no fruit:
even if they beget, I slay the treasures of their womb. [Hos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#017.md). My God rejects them: for they
have not hearkened to Him, and they shall be fugitives among the
nations." In [Hos 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md) Israel is
compared to a plant, that is so injured by the heat of the sun ([Psa
121:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006.md); [Psa
102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005).md), or by a worm ([Jon
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#007).md), that it dries up and bears no
more fruit. The perfects are a prophetic expression, indicating the
certain execution of the threat. This is repeated in [Hos
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md) in figurative language; and the
threatening in [Hos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md), [Hos
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012.md), is thereby strengthened. Lastly,
in [Hos 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#017.md) the words of threatening
are rounded off by a statement of the reason for the rejection of
Israel; and this rejection is described as banishment among the nations,
according to [Deu 28:65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065.md).
