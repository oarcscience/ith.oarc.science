### [Joshua Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 4:1</span></span>

Crossing the River. - In the account of the crossing, the main point is
their taking twelve stones with them from the bed of the river to the
opposite side to serve as a memorial. To set forth the importance of
this fact as a divine appointment, the command of God to Joshua is
mentioned first of all ([Jos 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#002.md), [Jos
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#003).md); then the repetition of this
command by Joshua to the men appointed for the work ([Jos
4:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#004).md); and lastly, the carrying out
of the instructions ([Jos 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#008).md). This
makes it appear as though God did not give the command to Joshua till
after the people had all crossed over, whereas the twelve men had
already been chosen for the purpose ([Jos
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#012).md). But this appearance, and the
discrepancy that seems to arise, vanish as soon as we take the different
clauses-which are joined together here by vav consec., according to the
simple form of historical composition adopted by the Hebrews, "and
Jehovah spake, saying," etc. ([Jos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#002.md), [Jos
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#003).md); "and Joshua called the twelve
men," etc. ([Jos 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#004).md), - and arrange
them in logical order, and with their proper subordination to one
another, according to our own modes of thought and conversation, as
follows: "Then Joshua called the twelve men-as Jehovah had commanded
him, saying, 'Take you twelve men out of the people,' etc. - and said to
them," etc.

(Note: So far as the meaning is concerned, Kimchi, Calvin, and many
others, were perfectly correct in taking [Jos
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md) as a parenthesis, and rendering
ויּאמר as a pluperfect, though, grammatically considered, and from a
Hebrew point of view, the historical sense with vav consec. does not
correspond to our pluperfect, but always expresses the succession either
of time or thought. This early Hebrew form of thought and narrative is
completely overlooked by Knobel, when he pronounces [Jos
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md) an interpolation from a second
document, and finds the apodosis to [Jos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md) in [Jos
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#004.md). The supposed discrepancy-namely,
that the setting up of the memorial is not described in [Jos
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#005.md). as a divine command, as in [Jos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#008.md), [Jos
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#010.md) -by which Knobel endeavours to
establish his hypothesis, is merely a deduction from the fact that
Joshua did not expressly issue his command to the twelve men as a
command of Jehovah, and therefore is nothing more than an unmeaning
argumentum e silentio.)

[Jos 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md)

When all the people had crossed over Jordan,

(Note: The piska in the middle of [Jos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md) is an old pre-Masoretic mark,
which the Masorites have left, indicating a space in the midst of the
verse, and showing that it was the commencement of a :parashah.)

Joshua issued to the twelve men who had been appointed by the twelve
tribes the command given to him by God: "Go before the ark of Jehovah
into the midst of Jordan, and take every man a stone upon his shoulder,
according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites," or, as it is
expressed in the fuller explanation in the divine command in [Jos
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#003.md), "from the standing-place of the
priests, the setting up of twelve stones (הכין is an infinitive used as
a substantive, or else it should be pointed as a substantive), and carry
them over with you, and lay them down in the place of encampment where
ye shall pass the night."

[Jos 4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#006.md)

This (viz., their taking the twelve stones with them and setting them
up) was to be a sign in Israel; the stones were to serve as a memorial
of the miraculous crossing of the Jordan to all succeeding generations.
For the expression "if your children ask to-morrow (in future)," etc.,
see [Exo 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#014.md); [Exo
12:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#026.md), and [Deu
6:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#020.md).

[Jos 4:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#008.md)

The children of Israel carried out these instructions. The execution is
ascribed to the "children of Israel," i.e., to the whole nations,
because the men selected from the twelve tribes acted in the name of the
whole nation, and the memorial was a matter of equal importance to all.
ינּחוּם does not signify that they set up the stones as a memorial, but
simply that they laid them down in their place of encampment. The
setting up at Gilgal is mentioned for the first time in [Jos
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#020.md). In addition to this, Joshua set
up twelve stones for a memorial, on the spot where the feet of the
priests had stood as they bore the ark of the covenant, which stones
were there "to this day," i.e., the time when the account was written.
There is nothing to warrant our calling this statement in question, or
setting it aside as a probable gloss, either in the circumstance that
nothing is said about any divine command to set up these stones, or in
the opinion that such a memorial would have failed of its object, as it
could not possibly have remained, but would very speedily have been
washed away by the stream. The omission of any reference to a command
from God proves nothing, simply because divine commands are frequently
hinted at but briefly, so that the substance of them has to be gathered
from the account of their execution (compare [Jos
3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#007.md), with [Jos
3:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#009.md), and [Jos
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#002.md), with [Jos
4:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#004).md); and consequently we may assume
without hesitation that such a command was given, as the earlier
commentators have done. Moreover, the monument did not fail of its
object, even if it only existed for a short time. The account of its
erection, which was handed down by tradition, would necessarily help to
preserve the remembrance of the miraculous occurrence. But it cannot be
so absolutely affirmed that these stones would be carried away at once
by the stream, so that they could never be seen any more. As the priests
did not stand in the middle or deepest part of the river, but just in
the bed of the river, and close to its eastern bank, and it was upon
this spot that the stones were set up, and as we neither know their size
nor the firmness with which they stood, we cannot pronounce any positive
opinion as to the possibility of their remaining. It is not likely that
they remained there for centuries; but they were intended rather as a
memorial for the existing generation and their children, than for a
later age, which would be perpetually reminded of the miraculous help of
God by the monument erected in Gilgal.

[Jos 4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#010.md)

Whilst Joshua was carrying out all that Jehovah had commanded him to say
to the people, according to the command of Moses-that is to say, whilst
the people were passing through the Jordan before the ark, and the
twelve men were carrying over the stones out of the river to the
resting-place on the other side, and Joshua himself was setting up
twelve stones in Jordan for a memorial-during all this time, the priests
stood with the ark in the bed of the river; but after all the people,
including the twelve men who took the stones out of the Jordan, had
finished crossing, the ark of the Lord passed over, with the priests,
before the people: that is to say, it stationed itself again, along with
the priests, at the head of the people. The words "according to all that
Moses had commanded Joshua" do not refer to any special instructions
which Moses had given to Joshua with reference to the crossing, for no
such instructions are to be found in the Pentateuch, nor can they be
inferred from [Num 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#023.md); [Deu
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#028.md), or [Deu
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#023.md); they simply affirm that Joshua
carried out all the commands which the Lord had given him, in accordance
with the charge which he received from Moses at the time when he was
first called. Moses had called him and instructed him to lead to the
people into the promised land, in consequence of a divine command; and
had given him the promise, at the same time, that Jehovah would be with
him as He had been with Moses. This contained implicite an admonition to
Joshua to do only what the Lord should command him. And if this was how
Joshua acted, the execution of the commands of God was also an
observance of the command of Moses. The remark in [Jos
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#010.md), "and the people hastened and
passed over," i.e., passed hastily through the bed of the river, is
introduced as an explanation of the fact that the priests stood still in
the bed of the river the whole time that the crossing continued. As the
priests stood in one spot whilst all the people were passing over, it
was necessary that the people should hasten over, lest the strength of
the priests should be exhausted. This reason for hastening, however,
does not preclude the other-namely, that the crossing had to be finished
in one day, before night came on. The statement in [Jos
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#011.md), that when all the people had
passed over, the ark of the Lord also passed over with the priests, is
so far anticipatory of the actual course of the events, that up to this
time nothing has been said about the fighting men belonging to the two
tribes and a half having passed over ([Jos
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#012.md), [Jos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013).md); nor has the command of God for
the ark to pass over been mentioned ([Jos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#015)..md), though both of these must have
preceded the crossing of the ark in order of time. It is to be observed,
that, in the words "the art of the Lord passed over, and the priests,"
the priests are subordinate to the ark, because it was through the
medium of the ark of the Lord that the miracle of drying up the river
had been effected: it was not by the priests, but by Jehovah the
Almighty God, who was enthroned upon the ark, that the waters were
commanded to stand still. "Before the people" (Eng. Ver. "in the
presence of the people") has the same signification in [Jos
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#011.md) as in [Jos
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#006.md), [Jos
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#014.md).

[Jos 4:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#012.md)

The account of the fighting men of the tribes on the east of the Jordan
passing over along with them, in number about 40,000, is added as a
supplement, because there was no place in which it could be
appropriately inserted before, and yet it was necessary that it should
be expressly mentioned that these tribes performed the promise they had
given ([Jos 1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#016).md), and in what
manner they did so. The words וגו ויּעברוּ do not imply that these
40,000 men crossed over behind the priests with the ark, which would not
only be at variance with the fact so expressly stated, that the ark of
the covenant was the medium of the miraculous division of the water, but
also with the distant statement in [Jos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#018.md), that when the priests, with the
ark, set their feet upon the dry land, the waters filled the river again
as they had done before. The imperfect with vav consec. here expresses
simply the order of thought, and not of time. "Arboth Jericho," the
steppes of Jericho, were that portion of the Arabah or Ghor which formed
the environs of Jericho, and which widens here into a low-lying plain of
about three and a half or four hours' journey in breadth, on account of
the western mountains receding considerably to the south of the opening
of the Wady Kelt (Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 263ff.). - In [Jos
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#014.md) the writer mentions still further
the fact that the Lord fulfilled His promise (in [Jos
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#007).md), and by means of this miracle so
effectually confirmed the authority of Joshua in the eyes of Israel,
that the people feared him all the days of his life as they had feared
Moses. "This was not the chief end of the miracle, that Joshua increased
in power and authority; but since it was a matter of great importance,
so far as the public interests were concerned, that the government of
Joshua should be established, it is very properly mentioned, as an
addition to the benefits that were otherwise conferred, that he was
invested as it were with sacred insignia, which produced such a felling
of veneration among the people, that no one dared to treat him with
disrespect" (Calvin).

[Joshua 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 4:15</span></span>

Termination of the miraculous Passage through the Jordan. - As soon as
the priests left their standing-place in the river with the ark of the
covenant, according to the command of God made known to them by Joshua,
and the soles of their feet "tore themselves loose upon the dry ground"
(נתּקוּ אל החרבה, constructio praegnans, for they tore themselves loose
from the soft soil of the river, and trode upon the dry or firm ground),
the waters of the Jordan returned again to their place, and went over
all its banks as before (vid., [Jos
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015).md). This affirms as clearly as
possible that it was the ark which kept back the stream.

[Joshua 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 4:19</span></span>

The crossing took place on the tenth day of the first month, that is to
say, on the same day on which, forty years before, Israel had begun to
prepare for going out of Egypt by setting apart the paschal lamb ([Exo
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003).md). After crossing the river, the
people encamped at Gilgal, on the eastern border of the territory of
Jericho. The place of encampment is called Gilgal proleptically in [Jos
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019.md) and [Jos
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#020.md) (see at [Jos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009).md).

[Joshua 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 4:20</span></span>

There Joshua set up the twelve stones, which they had taken over with
them out of the Jordan, and explained to the people at the same time the
importance of this memorial to their descendants ([Jos
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#021.md), [Jos
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#022).md), and the design of the miracle
which had been wrought by God ([Jos
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#024).md). On [Jos
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#021.md), [Jos
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#022.md), see [Jos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#006.md), [Jos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#007.md). אשׁר ([Jos
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#023).md), quod, as (see [Deu
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#022).md). The miracle itself, like the
similar one at the Dead Sea, had a double intention, viz., to reveal to
the Canaanites the omnipotence of the God of Israel, the strong hand of
the Lord (compare [Exo 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#004.md), [Exo
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#018.md), with [Jos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006.md); and for the expression "the hand
of the Lord is mighty," see [Exo 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#019.md);
[Exo 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#001), etc..md), and to serve as an
impulse to the Israelites to fear the Lord their God always (see at [Exo
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031).md).
