### [Exodus Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 23:1</span></span>

Lastly, no one was to violate another's rights. - [Exo
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md). "Thou shalt not raise (bring
out) an empty report." שׁוא שׁמע, a report that has no foundation, and,
as the context shows, does injury to another, charges him with
wrongdoing, and involves him in legal proceedings. "Put not thine hand
with a wicked man (do not offer him thy hand, or render him assistance),
to be a witness of violence." This clause is unquestionably connected
with the preceding one, and implies that raising a false report
furnishes the wicked man with a pretext for bringing the man, who is
suspected of crime on account of this false report, before a court of
law; in consequence of which the originator or propagator of the empty
report becomes a witness of injustice and violence.

[Exo 23:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#002.md)

Just as little should a man follow a multitude to pervert justice. "Thou
shalt not be behind many (follow the multitude) to evil things, nor
answer concerning a dispute to incline thyself after many (i.e., thou
shalt not give such testimony in connection with any dispute, in which
thou takest part with the great majority), so as to pervert" (להטּות),
sc., justice. But, on the other hand, "neither shalt thou adorn the poor
man in his dispute" ([Exo 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#003).md), i.e.,
show partiality to the poor or weak man in an unjust cause, out of weak
compassion for him. (Compare [Lev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015.md), a passage which,
notwithstanding the fact that הדר is applied to favour shown to the
great or mighty, overthrows Knobel's conjecture, that גּדל should be
read for ודל, inasmuch as it prohibits the showing of favour to the one
as much as to the other.)

[Exo 23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004.md)

Not only was their conduct not to be determined by public opinion, the
direction taken by the multitude, or by weak compassion for a poor man;
but personal antipathy, enmity, and hatred were not to lead them to
injustice or churlish behaviour. On the contrary, if the Israelite saw
his enemy's beast straying, he was to bring it back again; and if he saw
it lying down under the weight of its burden, he was to help it up again
(cf. [Deu 22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001).md). The words וגו מעזב
וחדלתּ, "cease (desist) to leave it to him (thine enemy); thou shalt
loosen it (let it loose) with him," which have been so variously
explained, cannot have any other signification than this: "beware of
leaving an ass which has sunk down beneath its burden in a helpless
condition, even to thine enemy, to try whether he can help it up alone;
rather help him to set it loose from its burden, that it may get up
again." This is evident from [Deu
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#004.md), where התעלּמתּ לא, "withdraw not
thyself," is substituted for מעזב חדלתּ, and עמּו תּקים הקם, "set up
with him," for עמּו תּעזב עזב. From this it is obvious that עזב is used
in the first instance in the sense of leaving it alone, leaving it in a
helpless condition, and immediately afterwards in the sense of undoing
or letting loose. The peculiar turn given to the expression, "thou shalt
cease from leaving," is chosen because the ordinary course, which the
natural man adopts, is to leave an enemy to take care of his own
affairs, without troubling about either him or his difficulties. Such
conduct as this the Israelite was to give up, if he ever found his enemy
in need of help.

[Exo 23:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#006.md)

The warning against unkindness towards an enemy is followed by still
further prohibitions of injustice in questions of right: viz., in [Exo
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#006.md), a warning against perverting the
right of the poor in his cause; in [Exo
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#007.md), a general command to keep far
away from a false matter, and not to slay the innocent and righteous,
i.e., not to be guilty of judicial murder, together with the threat that
God would not justify the sinner; and in [Exo
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#008.md), the command not to accept
presents, i.e., to be bribed by gifts, because "the gift makes seeing
men (פּקחים open eyes) blind, and perverts the causes of the just." The
rendering "words of the righteous" is not correct; for even if we are to
understand the expression "seeing men" as referring to judges, the
"righteous" can only refer to those who stand at the bar, and have right
on their side, which judges who accept of bribes may turn into wrong.

[Exo 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#009.md)

The warning against oppressing the foreigner, which is repeated from
[Exo 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#020.md), is not tautological, as
Bertheau affirms for the purpose of throwing suspicion upon this verse,
but refers to the oppression of a stranger in judicial matters by the
refusal of justice, or by harsh and unjust treatment in court ([Deu
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017.md); [Deu
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#019).md). "For ye know the soul (animus,
the soul as the seat of feeling) of the stranger," i.e., ye know from
your own experience in Egypt how a foreigner feels.

[Exo 23:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#010.md)

Here follow directions respecting the year of rest and day of rest, the
first of which lays the foundation for the keeping of the sabbatical and
jubilee years, which are afterwards instituted in Lev 25, whilst the
latter gives prominence to the element of rest and refreshment involved
in the Sabbath, which had been already instituted ([Exo
20:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#009).md), and presses it in favour of
beasts of burden, slaves, and foreigners. Neither of these instructions
is to be regarded as laying down laws for the feasts; so that they are
not to be included among the rights of Israel, which commence at [Exo
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014.md). On the contrary, as they are
separated from these by [Exo 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013.md),
they are to be reckoned as forming part of the laws relating to their
mutual obligations one towards another. This is evident from the fact,
that in both of them the care of the poor stands in the foreground. From
this characteristic and design, which are common to both, we may explain
the fact, that there is no allusion to the keeping of a Sabbath unto the
Lord, as in [Exo 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010.md) and [Lev
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#002.md), in connection with either the
seventh year or seventh day: all that is mentioned being their sowing
and reaping for six years, and working for six days, and then letting
the land lie fallow in the seventh year, and their ceasing or resting
from labour on the seventh day. "The seventh year thou shalt let (thy
land) loose (שׁמט to leave unemployed), and let it lie; and the poor of
thy people shall eat (the produce which grows of itself), and their
remainder (what they leave) shall the beast of the field eat." הנּפשׁ:
lit., to breathe one's self, to draw breath, i.e., to refresh one's self
(cf. [Exo 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#017.md); [Sa2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#014).md). - With [Exo
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013.md) the laws relating to the rights
of the people, in their relations to one another, are concluded with the
formula enforcing their observance, "And in all that I say to you, take
heed," viz., that ye carefully maintain all the rights which I have
given you. There is then attached to this, in [Exo
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014.md), a warning, which forms the
transition to the relation of Israel to Jehovah: "Make no mention of the
name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth." This
forms a very fitting boundary line between the two series of mishpatim,
inasmuch as the observance and maintenance of both of them depended upon
the attitude in which Israel stood towards Jehovah.

[Exodus 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 23:14</span></span>

The Fundamental Rights of Israel in its Religious and Theocratical
Relation to Jehovah. - As the observance of the Sabbath and sabbatical
year is not instituted in [Exo
23:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#010.md), so [Exo
23:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014.md) do not contain either the
original or earliest appointment of the feasts, or a complete law
concerning the yearly feasts. They simply command the observance of
three feasts during the year, and the appearance of the people three
times in the year before the Lord; that is to say, the holding of three
national assemblies to keep a feast before the Lord, or three annual
pilgrimages to the sanctuary of Jehovah. The leading points are clearly
set forth in [Exo 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014.md) and [Exo
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017.md), to which the other verses are
subordinate. These leading points are משׁפּטים or rights, conferred upon
the people of Israel in their relation to Jehovah; for keeping a feast
to the Lord, and appearing before Him, were both of them privileges
bestowed by Jehovah upon His covenant people. Even in itself the festal
rejoicing was a blessing in the midst of this life of labour, toil, and
trouble; but when accompanied with the right of appearing before the
Lord their God and Redeemer, to whom they were indebted for everything
they had and were, it was one that no other nation enjoyed. For though
they had their joyous festivals, these festivals bore the same relation
to those of Israel, as the dead and worthless gods of the heathen to the
living and almighty God of Israel.

Of the three feasts at which Israel was to appear before Jehovah, the
feast of Mazzoth, or unleavened bread, is referred to as already
instituted, by the words "as I have commanded thee," and "at the
appointed time of the earing month," which point back to chs. 12 and 13;
and all that is added here is, "ye shall not appear before My face
empty." "Not empty:" i.e., not with empty hands, but with sacrificial
gifts, answering to the blessing given by the Lord ([Deu
16:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016).md). These gifts were devoted
partly to the general sacrifices of the feast, and partly to the burnt
and peace-offerings which were brought by different individuals to the
feasts, and applied to the sacrificial meals (Num 28 and 29). This
command, which related to all the feasts, and therefore is mentioned at
the very outset in connection with the feast of unleavened bread, did
indeed impose a duty upon Israel, but such a duty as became a source of
blessing to all who performed it. The gifts demanded by God were the
tribute, it is true, which the Israelites paid to their God-King, just
as all Eastern nations are required to bring presents when appearing in
the presence of their kings; but they were only gifts from God's own
blessing, a portion of that which He had bestowed in rich abundance, and
they were offered to God in such a way that the offerer was thereby more
and more confirmed in the rights of covenant fellowship. The other two
festivals are mentioned here for the first time, and the details are
more particularly determined afterwards in [Lev
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md)., and [Num
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026.md). One was called the feast of
Harvest, "of the first-fruits of thy labours which thou hast sown in the
field," i.e., of thy field-labour. According to the subsequent
arrangements, the first of the field-produce was to be offered to God,
not the first grains of the ripe corn, but the first loaves of bread of
white or wheaten flour made from the new corn ([Lev
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017)..md). In [Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022.md) it is called the "feast of
Weeks," because, according to [Lev
23:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md); [Deu
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009.md), it was to be kept seven weeks
after the feast of Mazzoth; and the "feast of the first-fruits of wheat
harvest," because the loaves of first-fruits to be offered were to be
made of wheaten flour. The other of these feasts, i.e., the third in the
year, is called "the feast of Ingathering, at the end of the year, in
the gathering in of thy labours out of the field." This general and
indefinite allusion to time was quite sufficient for the preliminary
institution of the feast. In the more minute directions respecting the
feasts given in [Lev 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md); [Num
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012.md), it is fixed for the fifteenth
day of the seventh month, and placed on an equality with the feast of
Mazzoth as a seven days' festival. השּׁנה בּצאת does not mean after the
close of the year, finito anno, any more than the corresponding
expression in [Exo 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022.md), השּׁנה
תּקוּפת, signifies at the turning of the year. The year referred to here
was the so-called civil year, which began with the preparation of the
ground for the harvest-sowing, and ended when all the fruits of the
field and garden had been gathered in. No particular day was fixed for
its commencement, nor was there any new year's festival; and even after
the beginning of the earing month had been fixed upon for the
commencement of the year ([Exo 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002).md),
this still remained in force, so far as all civil matters connected with
the sowing and harvest were concerned; though there is no evidence that
a double reckoning was carried on at the same time, or that a civil
reckoning existed side by side with the religious. בּאספּך does not
mean, "when thou hast gathered," postquam collegisti; for בּ does not
stand for אחר, nor has the infinitive the force of the preterite. On the
contrary, the expression "at thy gathering in," i.e., when thou
gatherest in, is kept indefinite both here and in [Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md), where the month and days in
which this feast was to be kept are distinctly pointed out; and also in
[Deu 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013.md), in order that the time for
the feast might not be made absolutely dependent upon the complete
termination of the gathering in, although as a rule it would be almost
over. The gathering in of "thy labours out of the field" is not to be
restricted to the vintage and gathering of fruits: this is evident not
only from the expression "out of the field," which points to
field-produce, but also from the clause in [Deu
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013.md), "gathering of the floor and
wine-press," which shows clearly that the words refer to the gathering
in of the whole of the year's produce of corn, fruit, oil, and wine.

[Exodus 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 23:17</span></span>

"Three times in the year" (i.e., according to [Exo
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014.md) and [Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016.md), at the three feasts just
mentioned) "all thy males shall appear before the face of the Lord
Jehovah." The command to appear, i.e., to make a pilgrimage to the
sanctuary, was restricted to the male members of the nation, probably to
those above 20 years of age, who had been included in the census ([Num
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003).md). But this did not prohibit the
inclusion of women and boys (cf. [Sa1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003.md)., and [Luk
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#031)..md).

[Exodus 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 23:18</span></span>

The blessing attending their appearing before the Lord was dependent
upon the feasts being kept in the proper way, by the observance of the
three rules laid down in [Exo 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#018.md)
and [Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md). "Thou shalt not offer
the blood of My sacrifice upon leavened bread." על upon, as in [Exo
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#008.md), denoting the basis upon which
the sacrifice was offered. The meaning has been correctly given by the
early commentators, viz., "as long as there is any leavened bread in
your houses," or "until the leaven has been entirely removed from your
houses." The reference made here to the removal of leaven, and the
expression "blood of My sacrifice," both point to the paschal lamb,
which was regarded as the sacrifice of Jehovah κατ̓ ἐξοχήν, on account of
its great importance. Onkelos gives this explanation: "My Passover" for
"My sacrifice." - "Neither shall the fat of My feast remain (ילין to
pass the night) until the morning." "The fat of My feast" does not mean
the fat of My festal sacrifice, for חג, a feast, is not used for the
sacrifice offered at the feast; it signifies rather the best of My
feast, i.e., the paschal sacrifice, as we may see from [Exo
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#025.md), where "the sacrifice of the
feast of the Passover" is given as the explanation of "the fat of My
feast." As the paschal sacrifice was the sacrifice of Jehovah par
excellence, so the feast of the Passover was the feast of Jehovah par
excellence. The expression "fat of My feast" is not to be understood as
referring at all to the fat of the lamb, which was burned upon the altar
in the case of the expiatory and whole offerings; for there could have
been no necessity for the injunction not to keep this till the morning,
inasmuch as those parts of every sacrifice which were set apart for the
altar were burned immediately after the sprinkling of the blood. The
allusion is to the flesh of the paschal lamb, which was eaten in the
night before daybreak, after which anything that remained was to be
burned. עד־בּקר (without the article) till morning, has the same meaning
as לבּקר "for the (following) morning" in [Exo
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#025.md).

[Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md)

The next command in [Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md) has
reference to the feast of Harvest, or feast of Weeks. In "the
first-fruits of thy land" there is an unmistakeable allusion to "the
first-fruits of thy labours" in [Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md). It is true the words, "the
first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of
the Lord thy God," are so general in their character, that we can hardly
restrict them to the wave-loaves to be offered as first-fruits at the
feast of Weeks, but must interpret them as referring to all the
first-fruits, which they had already been commanded not to delay to
offer ([Exo 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029).md), and the
presentation of which is minutely prescribed in [Num
18:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012.md), and [Deu
26:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md), - including therefore the
sheaf of barley to be offered in the second day of the feast of
unleavened bread ([Lev 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#009)..md). At the
same time the reference to the feast of Weeks is certainly to be
retained, inasmuch as this feast was an express admonition to Israel, to
offer the first of the fruits of the Lord. In the expression בּכּוּרי
ראשׁית, the latter might be understood as explanatory of the former and
in apposition to it, since they are both of them applied to the
first-fruits of the soil (vid., [Deu
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md), [Deu
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#010.md), and [Num
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#013).md). But as ראשׁית could hardly
need any explanation in this connection, the partitive sense is to be
preferred; though it is difficult to decide whether "the first of the
first-fruits" signifies the first selection from the fruits that had
grown, ripened, and been gathered first-that is to say, not merely of
the entire harvest, but of every separate production of the field and
soil, according to the rendering of the lxx ἀπαρχηὰς τῶν πρωτογεννημάτων
τῆς γῆς, - or whether the word ראשׁית is used figuratively, and
signifies the best of the first-fruits. There is no force in the
objection offered to the former view, that "in no other case in which
the offering of first-fruits generally is spoken of, is one particular
portion represented as holy to Jehovah, but the first-fruits themselves
are that portion of the entire harvest which was holy to Jehovah." For,
apart from [Num 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012.md), where a
different rendering is sometimes given to ראשׁית, the expression מראשׁית
in [Deu 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md) shows unmistakeably that
only a portion of the first of all the fruit of the ground had to be
offered to the Lord. On the other hand, this view is considerably
strengthened by the fact, that whilst בּכּוּר, בּכּוּרים signify those
fruits which ripened first, i.e., earliest, ראשׁית is used to denote the
ἀπαρχή, the first portion or first selection from the whole, not only in
[Deu 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md), [Deu
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#010.md), but also in [Lev
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010.md), and most probably in [Num
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012.md) as well. - Now if these
directions do not refer either exclusively or specially to the loaves of
first-fruits of the feast of Weeks, the opinion which has prevailed from
the time of Abarbanel to that of Knobel, that the following command,
"Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk," refers to the feast
of Ingathering, is deprived of its principal support. And any such
allusion is rendered very questionable by the fact, that in [Deu
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021.md), where this command is repeated,
it is appended to the prohibition against eating the flesh of an animal
that had been torn to pieces. Very different explanations have been
given to the command. In the Targum, Mishnah, etc., it is regarded as a
general prohibition against eating flesh prepared with milk. Luther and
others suppose it to refer to the cooking of the kid, before it has been
weaned from its mother's milk. But the actual reference is to the
cooking of a kid in the milk of its own mother, as indicating a contempt
of the relation which God has established and sanctified between parent
and young, and thus subverting the divine ordinances. As kids were a
very favourite food ([Gen 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#009.md), [Gen
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#014.md); [Jdg
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#019.md); [Jdg
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#015.md); [Sa1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#020).md), it is very likely that by way
of improving the flavour they were sometimes cooked in milk. According
to Aben Ezra and Abarbanel, this was a custom adopted by the
Ishmaelites; and at the present day the Arabs are in the habit of
cooking lamb in sour milk. A restriction is placed upon this custom in
the prohibition before us, but there is no intention to prevent the
introduction of a superstitious usage customary at the sacrificial meals
of other nations, which Spencer and Knobel have sought to establish as
at all events probable, though without any definite historical proofs,
and for the most part on the strength of far-fetched analogies.

[Exodus 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 23:20</span></span>

Relation of Jehovah to Israel. - The declaration of the rights conferred
by Jehovah upon His people is closed by promises, through which, on the
one hand, God insured to the nation the gifts and benefits involved in
their rights, and, on the other hand, sought to promote that willingness
and love which were indispensable to the fulfilment of the duties
incumbent upon every individual in consequence of the rights conferred
upon them. These promises secured to the people not only the protection
and help of God during their journey through the desert, and in the
conquest of Canaan, but also preservation and prosperity when they had
taken possession of the land.

[Exo 23:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md)

Jehovah would send an angel before them, who should guard them on the
way from injury and destruction, and bring them to the place prepared
for them, i.e., to Canaan. The name of Jehovah was in this angel ([Exo
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021).md), that is to say, Jehovah
revealed Himself in him; and hence he is called in [Exo
33:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#015.md), the face of Jehovah, because
the essential nature of Jehovah was manifested in him. This angel was
not a created spirit, therefore, but the manifestation of Jehovah
Himself, who went before them in the pillar of cloud and fire, to guide
and to defend them ([Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021).md). But
because it was Jehovah who was guiding His people in the person of the
angel, He demanded unconditional obedience ([Exo
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021).md), and if they provoked Him
(תּמּר for תּמר, see [Exo 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018).md) by
disobedience, He would not pardon their transgression; but if they
followed Him and hearkened to His voice, He would be an enemy to their
enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries ([Exo
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#022).md). And when the angel of the Lord
had brought them to the Canaanites and exterminated the latter, Israel
was still to yield the same obedience, by not serving the gods of the
Canaanites, or doing after their works, i.e., by not making any
idolatrous images, but destroying them (these works), and smiting to
pieces the pillars of their idolatrous worship (מצבת does not mean
statues erected as idols, but memorial stones or columns dedicated to
idols: see my Comm. on [Kg1 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023).md),
and serving Jehovah alone. Then would He bless them in the land with
bountiful provision, health, fruitfulness, and length of life ([Exo
23:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023).md). "Bread and water" are
named, as being the provisions which are indispensable to the
maintenance of life, as in [Isa 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md);
[Isa 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#020.md); [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016.md). The taking away of "sickness"
(cf. [Exo 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026).md) implied the removal
of everything that could endanger life. The absence of anything that
miscarried, or was barren, insured the continuance and increase of the
nation; and the promise that their days should be fulfilled, i.e., that
they should not be liable to a premature death (cf. [Isa
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020).md), was a pledge of their
well-being.

[Exo 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027.md)

But the most important thing of all for Israel was the previous conquest
of the promised land. And in this God gave it a special promise of His
almighty aid. "I will send My fear before thee." This fear was to be the
result of the terrible acts of God performed on behalf of Israel, the
rumour of which would spread before them and fill their enemies with
fear and trembling (cf. [Exo 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014.md).;
[Deu 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026.md); and [Jos
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#011.md), where the beginning of the
fulfilment is described), throwing into confusion and putting to flight
every people against whom (בּהם - אשׁר) Israel came. ערף את־איב נתן to
give the enemy to the neck, i.e., to cause him to turn his back, or flee
(cf. [Psa 18:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041.md); [Psa
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013.md); [Jos
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#008.md), [Jos
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#012).md). אליך: in the direction towards
thee.

[Exo 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#028.md)

In addition to the fear of God, hornets (הצּרעה construed as a generic
word with the collective article), a very large species of wasp, that
was greatly dreaded both by man and beast on account of the acuteness of
its sting, should come and drive out the Canaanites, of whom three
tribes are mentioned instar omnium, from before the Israelites. Although
it is true that Aelian (hist. anim. 11, 28) relates that the Phaselians,
who dwelt near the Solymites, and therefore probably belonged to the
Canaanites, were driven out of their country by wasps, and Bochart
(Hieroz. iii. pp. 409ff.) has collected together accounts of different
tribes that have been frightened away from their possessions by frogs,
mice, and other vermin, "the sending of hornets before the Israelites"
is hardly to be taken literally, not only because there is not a word in
the book of Joshua about the Canaanites being overcome and exterminated
in any such way, but chiefly on account of [Jos
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#012.md), where Joshua says that God sent
the hornet before them, and drove out the two kings of the Amorites,
referring thereby to their defeat and destruction by the Israelites
through the miraculous interposition of God, and thus placing the
figurative use of the term hornet beyond the possibility of doubt. These
hornets, however, which are very aptly described in Wis. 12:8, on the
basis of this passage, as προδρόμους, the pioneers of the army of
Jehovah, do not denote merely varii generis mala, as Rosenmller
supposes, but acerrimos timoris aculeos, quibus quodammodo volantibus
rumoribus pungebantur, ut fugerent (Augustine, quaest. 27 in Jos.). If
the fear of God which fell upon the Canaanites threw them into such
confusion and helpless despair, that they could not stand before Israel,
but turned their backs towards them, the stings of alarm which followed
this fear would completely drive them away. Nevertheless God would not
drive them away at once, "in one year," lest the land should become a
desert for want of men to cultivate it, and the wild beasts should
multiply against Israel; in other words, lest the beasts of prey should
gain the upper hand and endanger the lives of man and beast ([Lev
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#022.md); [Eze
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#015.md), [Eze
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021).md), which actually was the case
after the carrying away of the ten tribes ([Kg2
17:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025).md). He would drive them out by
degrees (מעט מעט, only used here and in [Deu
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022).md), until Israel was sufficiently
increased to take possession of the land, i.e., to occupy the whole of
the country. This promise was so far fulfilled, according to the books
of Joshua and Judges, that after the subjugation of the Canaanites in
the south and north of the land, when all the kings who fought against
Israel had been smitten and slain and their cities captured, the entire
land was divided among the tribes of Israel, in order that they might
exterminate the remaining Canaanites, and take possession of those
portions of the land that had not yet been conquered ([Jos
13:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001).md). But the different tribes soon
became weary of the task of exterminating the Canaanites, and began to
enter into alliance with them, and were led astray by them to the
worship of idols; whereupon God punished them by withdrawing His
assistance, and they were oppressed and humiliated by the Canaanites
because of their apostasy from the Lord (Judg 1 and 2).

[Exo 23:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031.md)

The divine promise closes with a general indication of the boundaries of
the land, whose inhabitants Jehovah would give up to the Israelites to
drive them out, and with a warning against forming alliances with them
and their gods, lest they should lead Israel astray to sin, and thus
become a snare to it. On the basis of the promise in [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md), certain grand and prominent
points are mentioned, as constituting the boundaries towards both the
east and west. On the west the boundary extended from the Red Sea (see
[Exo 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018).md) to the sea of the
Philistines, or Mediterranean Sea, the south-eastern shore of which was
inhabited by the Philistines; and on the east from the desert, i.e.,
according to [Deu 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024.md), the desert of
Arabia, to the river (Euphrates). The poetic suffix מו affixed to
גּרשׁתּ answers to the elevated oratorical style. Making a covenant with
them and their gods would imply the recognition and toleration of them,
and, with the sinful tendencies of Israel, would be inevitably followed
by the worship of idols. The first כּי in [Exo
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#033.md) signifies if; the second, imo,
verily, and serves as an energetic introduction to the apodosis. מוקשׁ,
a snare (vid., [Exo 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#007).md); here a
clause of destruction, inasmuch as apostasy from God is invariably
followed by punishment ([Jdg 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#003).md).
