### [Joshua Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 17:1</span></span>

The inheritance of Manasseh on this side of the Jordan was on the north
of Ephraim.

[Jos 17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md)

Before proceeding to the more detailed description of the inheritance,
the historian thinks it necessary to observe that the Manassites
received a double inheritance. This remark is introduced with the words
"for he was the first-born of Joseph." On this account, in addition to
the territory already given to him in Gilead and Bashan, he received a
second allotment of territory in Canaan proper. With the word למכיר (for
Machir) the more minute account of the division of the Manassites
commences. וגו למכיר is first of all written absolutely at the beginning
of the sentence, and then resumed in לו ויהי: "to Machir, the first-born
of Manasseh ... to him were Gilead and Bashan assigned, because he was a
man of war," i.e., a warlike man, and had earned for himself a claim to
the inheritance of Gilead and Bashan through the peculiar bravery which
he had displayed in the conquest of those lands. By Machir, however, we
are not to understand the actual son of Manasseh, but his family; and
הגּלעד אבי does not mean "father of Gilead," but lord (possessor) of
Gilead, for Machir's son Gilead is always called גלעד without the
article (vid., [Jos 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#003.md); [Num
26:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029.md); [Num
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md); [Num
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md); [Ch1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#017).md), whereas the country of that
name is just as constantly called הגּלעד (see [Jos
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md), the last clause, [Jos
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#005.md); [Jos
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#011.md), [Jos
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#031.md); [Num
32:40](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#040.md); [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010)..md). "And there came, i.e., the lot
fell (the lot is to be repeated from [Jos
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001).md), to the other descendants of
Manasseh according to their families," which are then enumerated as in
[Num 26:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030.md). "These are the male
descendants of Manasseh." הזּכרים must not be altered, notwithstanding
the fact that it is preceded and followed by הגּותרים; it is evidently
used deliberately as an antithesis to the female descendants of Manasseh
mentioned in [Jos 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#003.md).

[Jos 17:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#003.md)

Among the six families of Manasseh ([Jos
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#002).md), Zelophehad, a descendant of
Hepher, left no son; but he had five daughters, whose names are given in
[Jos 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#003.md) (as in [Num
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#033.md); [Num
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md); [Num
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#010).md). These daughters had petitioned
Moses for a separate portion in the promised land, and their request had
been granted ([Num 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#002.md)., compared
with Josh 36). They therefore came before the committee appointed for
dividing the land and repeated this promised, which as at once
fulfilled. Consequently there were ten families of Manasseh who had
received portions by the side of Ephraim, five male and five female.
"And ([Jos 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#005).md) there fell the
measurements of Manasseh (as) ten," i.e., ten portions were assigned to
the Manassites (on the west of the Jordan), beside the land of Gilead,
because (as is again observed in [Jos
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#006).md) the daughters of Manasseh, i.e.,
of Zelophehad the Manassite, received an inheritance among his sons
(i.e., the rest of the Manassites).

[Jos 17:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007.md)

Boundaries and extent of the inheritance of the ten families of
Manasseh. - [Jos 17:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007.md), the southern
boundary, which coincides with the northern boundary of Ephraim
described in [Jos 16:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006.md), and is
merely given here with greater precision in certain points. It went
"from Asher to Michmethah, before Shechem." Asher is not the territory
of the tribe of Asher, but a distinct locality; according to the Onom.
(s. v. Asher) a place on the high road from Neapolis to Scythopolis,
fifteen Roman miles from the former. It is not to be found, however, in
the ruins of Tell Um el Aschera (V. de Velde) or Tell Um Ajra (Rob.
Bibl. Res. pp. 310, 327), an hour to the south of Beisan, as Knobel
supposes, but in the village of Yasir, where there are magnificent
ruins, about five hours and ten minutes from Nabulus on the road to
Beisan (V. de Velde, Mem. pp. 237, 289; R. ii. p. 295). Michmethah,
before Shechem, is still unknown (see [Jos
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006).md). Shechem was founded by the
Hivite prince Shechem ([Gen 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018).md),
and is frequently mentioned in the book of Genesis. It stood between
Ebal and Gerizim, was given up by Ephraim to the Levites, and declared a
free city (city of refuge: [Jos 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#021.md);
[Jos 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007).md). It was there that the ten
tribes effected their separation from Judah [Kg1
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001)..md), and Jeroboam resided there
([Kg1 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#025).md). In later times it was
the chief city of the country of Samaria, and the capital of the
Samaritans ([Joh 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#005).md); and the name of
Neapolis, or Flavia Neapolis, from which the present Nabulus or Nablus
has come, was given to it in honour of Vespasian (see v. Raumer, Pal.
pp. 161ff.). From this point the boundary went אל־היּמין (i.e., either
"to the right side," the south side, or to Yamin), "To the inhabitants
of En-tappuah." Whether Yamin is an appellative or a proper name is
doubtful. But even if it be the name of a place, it is quite certain
that it cannot be the village of Yamn, an hour to the south-east of
Taanuk (Rob. iii. pp. 161, 167, etc.), as this is much too far north,
and, judging from [Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md), belonged
to the territory of Asher. In the case of En-tappuah, the inhabitants
are mentioned instead of the district, because the district belonged to
Manasseh, whilst the town on the border of Manasseh was given to the
Ephraimites. The situation of the town has not yet been discovered: see
at [Jos 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008.md). From this point the
boundary ran down to the Cane-brook (see [Jos
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008).md), namely to the south side of the
brook.

"These towns were assigned to Ephraim in the midst of the towns of
Manasseh, and (but) the territory of Manasseh was on the north of the
brook." The only possible meaning of these words is the following: From
Tappuah, the boundary went down to the Cane-brook and crossed it, so
that the south side of the brook really belonged to the territory of
Manasseh; nevertheless the towns on this south side were allotted to
Ephraim, whilst only the territory to the north of the brook fell to the
lot of the Manassites. This is expressed more plainly in [Jos
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010.md): "To the south (of the brook the
land came) to Ephraim, and to the north to Manasseh." In [Jos
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010.md) the northern and eastern
boundaries are only briefly indicated: "And they (the Manassites)
touched Asher towards the north, and Issachar towards the east." The
reason why this boundary was not described more minutely, was probably
because it had not yet been fixed. For ([Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011).md) Manasseh also received towns
and districts in (within the territory of) Issachar and Asher, viz.,
Beth-shean, etc. Beth-shean, to the wall of which Saul's body was
fastened ([Sa1 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#010.md).; [Sa2
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#012).md), was afterwards called
Scythopolis. It was in the valley of the Jordan, where the plain of
Jezreel slopes off into the valley; its present name is Beisan, a place
where there are considerable ruins of great antiquity, about two hours
from the Jordan (vid., Seetzen, ii. pp. 162ff.; Rob. iii. p. 174; Bibl.
Res. p. 325; v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 150-1). This city, with its daughter
towns, was in the territory of Issachar, which was on the east of
Manasseh, and may have extended a considerable distance towards the
south along the valley of the Jordan, as the territory of Manasseh and
Ephraim did not run into the valley of the Jordan; but Asher (Yasir) is
mentioned in [Jos 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007.md) as the most
easterly place in Manasseh, and, according to [Jos
16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006.md), the eastern boundary of
Ephraim ran down along the eastern edge of the mountains as far as
Jericho, without including the Jordan valley. At the same time, the Ghor
on the western side of the Jordan below Beisan, as far as the plain of
Jericho, was of no great value to any tribe, as this district, according
to Josephus (de Bell. Jud. iv. 8, 2, and iii. 10, 7), was uninhabited
because of its barrenness. The other towns, Ibleam, etc., with the
exception of Endor perhaps, were in the territory of Asher, and almost
all on the south-west border of the plain of Esdraelon. Ibleam, called
Bileam in [Ch1 6:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#055) (70.md), a Levitical
town (see at [Jos 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025).md), was not very
far from Megiddo ([Kg2 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027).md), and has
probably been preserved in the ruins of Khirbet-Belameh, half an hour to
the south of Jenin; according to Schultz, it is the same place as
Belamon, Belmen, or Belthem (Judith 4:4; 7:3; 8:3). With דאר ואת־ישׁבי
the construction changes, so that there is an anacolouthon, which can be
explained, however, on the ground that ל היה may not only mean to be
assigned to, but also to receive or to have. In this last sense ואת is
attached. The inhabitants are mentioned instead of the towns, because
the historian had already the thought present in his mind, that the
Manassites were unable to exterminate the Canaanites from the towns
allotted to them. Dor is the present Tortura (see at [Jos
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002).md). Endor, the home of the witch
([Sa1 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007).md), four Roman miles to the
south of Tabor (Onom.), at present a village called Endr, on the
northern shoulder of the Duhy or Little Hermon (see Rob. iii. p. 225;
Bibl. Res. p. 340). Taanach and Megiddo, the present Taanuk and Lejun
(see at [Jos 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#021).md). The three last
towns, with the places dependent upon them, are connected more closely
together by הנּפת שׁלשׁת, the three-hill-country, probably because they
formed a common league.

[Jos 17:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#012.md)

The Manassites were unable to exterminate the Canaanites from these six
towns, and the districts round; but when they grew stronger, they made
them tributary slaves (cf. [Jos
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010).md).

[Joshua 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 17:14</span></span>

Complaint of the Descendants of Joseph respecting the inheritance
allotted to them. - [Jos 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014.md). As the
descendants of Joseph formed two tribes (Ephraim and Manasseh), they
gave utterance to their dissatisfaction that Joshua had given them
("me," the house of Joseph, [Jos
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#017).md) but one lot, but one portion
(חבל, a measure, then the land measured off), for an inheritance,
although they were a strong and numerous people. "So far hath Jehovah
blessed me hitherto." עד־אשׁד, to this (sc., numerous people), is to be
understood de gradu; עד־כּה, hitherto, de tempore. There was no real
ground for this complaint. As Ephraim numbered only 32,500 and Manasseh
52,700 at the second census in the time of Moses (Num 26), and therefore
Ephraim and half Manasseh together did not amount to more than 58,000 or
59,000, this tribe and a half were not so strong as Judah with its
76,500, and were even weaker than Dan with its 64,400, or Issachar with
its 64,300 men, and therefore could not justly lay claim to more than
the territory of a single tribe. Moreover, the land allotted to them was
in one of the most fertile parts of Palestine. For although as a whole
the mountains of Ephraim have much the same character as those of Judah,
yet the separate mountains are neither so rugged nor so lofty, there
being only a few of them that reach the height of 2500 feet above the
level of the sea (see Ritter, Erdk. xv. pp. 475ff.; V. de Velde, Mem.
pp. 177ff.); moreover, they are intersected by many broad valleys and
fertile plateaux, which are covered with fruitful fields and splendid
plantations of olives,vines, and fig trees (see Rob. iii. p. 78, Bibl.
Res. pp. 290ff.; Seetzen, ii. pp. 165ff., 190ff.). On the west the
mountains slope off into the hill country, which joins the plain of
Sharon, with its invariable fertility. "The soil here is a black clay
soil of unfathomable depth, which is nearly all ploughed, and is of such
unusual fertility that a cultivated plain here might furnish an almost
unparalleled granary for the whole land. Interminable fields full of
wheat and barley with their waving ears, which were very nearly ripe,
with here and there a field of millet, that was already being diligently
reaped by the peasants, presented a glorious sight" (Ritter, Erdk. xvi.
pp. 567-8).

[Jos 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015.md)

Joshua therefore sent them back with their petition, and said, "If thou
art a strong people, go up into the wood and cut it away," i.e., make
room for houses, fields, and meadows, by clearing the forests, "in the
land of the Perizzites and Rephaim, if the mountain of Ephraim is too
narrow for thee." The name "mountain of Ephraim" is used here in a
certain sense proleptically, to signify the mountain which received its
name from the tribe of Ephraim, to which it had only just been allotted.
This mountain, which is also called the mountain of Israel ([Jos
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#016.md), [Jos
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#021).md), was a limestone range running
from Kirjath-jearim, where the mountains of Judah terminate (see at [Jos
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#021).md), to the plain of Jezreel, and
therefore embracing the greater part of the tribe-territory of Benjamin.
The wood, which is distinguished from the mountain of Ephraim, and is
also described in [Jos 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#018.md) as a
mountainous land, is either the mountainous region extending to the
north of Yasir as far as the mountains at Gilboa, and lying to the west
of Beisan, a region which has not yet been thoroughly explored, or else,
as Knobel supposes, "the broad range of woody heights or low woody
hills, by which the mountains of Samaria are connected with Carmel on
the north-west (Rob. iii. p. 189), between Taanath and Megiddo on the
east, and Caesarea and Dor on the west." Possibly both may be intended,
as the children of Joseph were afraid of the Canaanites in Beisan and in
the plain of Jezreel ([Jos 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016).md). The
Rephaim were dwelling there, a tribe of gigantic stature (see at [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005).md), also the Perizzites (see at
[Gen 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007).md).

[Jos 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016.md)

The children of Joseph replied that the mountain (allotted to them)
would not be enough for them (מצא, as in [Num
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#022.md); [Zac
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#010).md); and that all the Canaanites
who dwelt in the land of the plain had iron chariots, both those in
Beth-shean and its daughter towns, and those in the valley of Jezreel.
ארץ־העמק, the land of the plain or valley land, includes both the valley
of the Jordan near Beisan, and also the plain of Jezreel, which opens
into the Jordan valley in the neighbourhood of Beisan (Rob. iii. p.
173). The plain of Jezreel, so called after the town of that name, is
called the "great field of Esdrelom" in Judith 1:4, and τὸ μέγα πεδίον
by Josephus. It is the present Merj (i.e., pasture-land) Ibn Aamer,
which runs in a south-westerly direction from the Mediterranean Sea
above Carmel, and reaches almost to the Jordan. It is bounded on the
south by the mountains of Carmel, the mountain-land of Ephraim and the
range of hills connecting the two, on the north by the mountains of
Galilee, on the west by the southern spurs of the Galilean highland, and
on the east by the mountains of Gilboa and the Little Hermon (Jebel
Duhy). Within these boundaries it is eight hours in length from east to
west, and five hours broad; it is fertile throughout, though very
desolate now (see v. Raumer, Pal. iii. pp. 39ff.). "Iron chariots" are
not scythe chariots, for these were introduced by Cyrus, and were
unknown to the Medes, Persians, and Arabians, i.e., to the early
Asiatics before his time (Xen. Cyr. vi. 1, 27, 30), as well as to the
ancient Egyptians (see Wilkinson, Manners and Customs, i. p. 350); they
were simply chariots tipped with iron, just as the Egyptian war-chariots
were made of wood and strengthened with metal nails and tips (Wilkinson,
pp. 342, 348).

[Jos 17:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#017.md)

As the answer of the children of Joseph indicated cowardice and want of
confidence in the help of God, Joshua contented himself with repeating
his first reply, though more fully and with the reasons assigned. "Thou
art a strong people, and hast great power; there will not be one lot to
thee:" i.e., because thou art a numerous people and endowed with
strength, there shall not remain one lot to thee, thou canst and wilt
extend thine inheritance. "For the mountain will be thine, for it is
forest, and thou wilt hew it out, and its goings out will become thine."
By the mountain we are not to understand the mountains of Ephraim which
were assigned to the Ephraimites by the lot, but the wooded mountains
mentioned in [Jos 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015.md), which the
children of Joseph were to hew out, so as to make outlets for
themselves. "The outgoings of it" are the fields and plains bordering
upon the forest. For the Canaanites who dwelt there ([Jos
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015).md) would be driven out by the
house of Joseph, just because they had iron chariots and were strong,
and therefore only a strong tribe like Joseph was equal to the task.
"Not one of the tribes of Israel is able to fight against them (the
Canaanites) because they are strong, but you have strength enough to be
able to expel them" (Rashi).
