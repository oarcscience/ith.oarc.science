### [1 Chronicles Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 8:1</span></span>

The families of Benjamin enumerated in this chapter were probably
separated from those in [Ch1 7:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md),
merely on the ground that all the registers which are grouped together
in 1 Chron 7 were taken from another genealogical document than that
from which the registers in our chapter, which form a supplement to the
short fragments in [Ch1 7:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md), have
been derived.

[Ch1 8:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

The sons of Benjamin and Bela. - The manner in which the five sons
begotten by Benjamin are enumerated is remarkable, "Bela his first-born,
Ashbel the second," etc., since, according to [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md), after the first-born Bela,
Becher follows as the second son, and Ashbel is the third; while Aharah,
Nohah, and Rapha are not met with there, quite other names occupying
their place. In אחרח we can easily recognise the אחירם of [Num
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038.md), whence the enumeration in [Ch1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md). harmonizes with the order in [Num
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038.md). It is therefore clear, that in
our genealogy only those sons are mentioned who founded the families of
Benjamin. The names נוחה and רפא are nowhere else met with among the
sons of Benjamin; but we may conclude, partly from the agreement of the
first three names with the heads of the families of Benjamin enumerated
in [Num 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038.md), and partly from the
agreement as to the number, which is five in both passages, that נוחה
and רפא are intended to correspond to the שׁפוּפם and חוּפם of [Num
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#039.md). The only question which then
remains is, whether the variation in the names arises from these two
sons of Benjamin having had different names, or from the families which
issued from Shephupham and Hupham having afterwards perhaps received new
names from famous chiefs, instead of the original designations, so that
Nohah and Rapha would be later descendants of Shephupham and Hupham.
Even this second supposition seems possible, since הוליד in such
genealogical registers may denote mediate procreation. If, e.g., Nohah
were a grandson or great-grandson of Shephupham the son of Benjamin, he
might well be introduced in the genealogical lists of the families as
begotten by Benjamin.

[Ch1 8:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#003.md)

The sons of Bela. Of the six names borne by these sons, גּרא is twice
met with; נעמן is found in [Gen 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md)
as the son, and in [Num 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#040.md) as
grandson of Benjamin; שׁפוּפן is another form of שׁפוּפם, [Num
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#039.md); and חוּרם may be a
transcriber's error for chuwpaam, [Num
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#039.md), just as אדּר probably stands
for ארדּ, [Gen 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md). The occurrence
of the name Gera would be incomprehensible only if בּנים denoted sons in
the narrower sense of the word; but if בּנים fi tub are sons in the
wider sense, i.e., descendants who founded fathers'-houses (groups of
related households), two cousins might have the same name. In that case,
Addar, Shephuphan, and Huram also may be different persons from Ard,
Shephupham, and Hupham. Abihud and Abishua are met with as descendants
of Benjamin only here, and 'achowach may be connected with אחיּה, [Ch1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#007.md).

[1 Chronicles 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 8:6</span></span>

Sons of Ehud. - The descent of Ehud from the sons, grandsons, and
descendants of Benjamin, enumerated in [Ch1
8:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md), is not given. The names of
Ehud's sons follow only at the end of the [Ch1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#007.md), "And he begat Uzza and Ahihud,"
while the intermediate clauses contain historical remarks. These sons
were "heads of fathers'-houses of the inhabitants of Geba," i.e., Geba
of Benjamin ([Sa1 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#016).md), the Levite
city, [Ch1 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#045.md), which still remains
as the half-ruinous village Jeba, about three leagues to the north of
Jerusalem; see on [Jos 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024.md). "And
they led them captive to Manahath, viz., Naaman and Ahiah and Gera, this
man led them captive." The subject to ויּגלוּם are the men mentioned in
the following verse, while the הוּא which follows shows that, of the
three above mentioned, the last, Gera, was the author of their
captivity. The place Manahath is not known, but is conjectured to be
connected with Hazi-Hammanahti and Hazi-Hammenuhoth, [Ch1
2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054.md) and [Ch1
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052.md); but we cannot ascertain with
certainty whether the name denotes a city or a district, and the
situation of it has not yet been discovered. Of the hostile collision of
these Benjamite families also, no more detailed accounts have come down
to us.

[1 Chronicles 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 8:8</span></span>

The descendants of Shaharaim. - The descent of Shaharaim from the sons
and grandsons named in [Ch1 8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md) is
obscure, and the conjecture which connects him with Ahishahar of [Ch1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#010.md) is unsupported. He was the father
of a considerable number of heads of fathers'-houses, whom his two or
three wives bore to him. According to [Ch1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#008.md), he begat "in the country of Moab
after he had sent them, Hushim and Baara his wives, away; ([Ch1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#009).md) there begat he with Hodesh his
wife, Jobab," etc. When and how Shaharaim, a Benjamite, came into the
country of Moab, is not known; all that can be gathered from our verse
is that he must have lived there for a considerable time. שׁלחו is
infin. Pi., the "i" being retained, and the Daghesh forte omitted with
Sheva (cf. as to this formation, Ew. 238, d.). אתם, accus. of the
pronoun, which, as it precedes its noun, is in gen. masc., although the
names of women follow (cf. for this use of the pronoun, Ew. 309, c.).
חוּשׁים and בּערה are women, as we learn from the following נשׁיו. By
this parenthesis, the beginning of the main sentence has been lost sight
of, and the הוליד is taken up again in ויּולד. As to הוליד with מן, cf.
the remark on [Ch1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#008.md). חדשׁ is the
third wife, which he took instead of those he had sent away. The seven
names in [Ch1 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#009.md), [Ch1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#010.md) are grouped together as sons or
descendants of the last-named wife, by the concluding remark, "These his
sons are heads of fathers'-houses." Then, further, in [Ch1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#011.md), [Ch1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012.md), the sons and grandsons of the
first (divorced) wives, one of whom built the cities Ono and Lydda, are
enumerated; but we have no means of determining whether the בּנה הוּא
refers to Shemer, the last mentioned, or to Elpaal the father of the
three sons, Eber, and Misham, and Shemer. It would, however, naturally
suggest itself, that the words referred to the first. לד (Lod) is
without doubt the city Lydda, where Peter healed the paralytic ([Act
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#032)..md). It belonged in the Syrian age
to Samaria, but it was added to Judea by the King Demetrius Soter, and
given to Jonathan for a possession (1 Macc. 11:34, cf. with 10:30, 38).
In the Jewish was it was destroyed by the Roman general Cestius (Joseph.
de Bell. Jud. ii. 19. 1), but was rebuilt at a later time, and became
the site of a toparchy of Judea. In still later times it was called
Diospolis, but is now a considerable Mohammedan village, lying between
Jafa and Jerusalem to the north of Ramleh, which bears the old name
Ludd, by the Arabs pronounced also Lidd. See v. Raumer, Pal. S. 10;
Robins. Pal. sub voce; and Tobler, Dritte Wanderung, S. 69f. Ono is
mentioned elsewhere only in [Ezr 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#033.md);
[Neh 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#037.md) and [Neh
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#035.md), along with Lod, and must have
been a place in the neighbourhood of Lydda.

[1 Chronicles 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 8:13</span></span>

Heads of fathers'-houses of the tribe of Benjamin, who dwelt partly in
Aijalon ([Ch1 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#013).md) and partly in
Jerusalem. - Their connection with the heads of fathers'-houses already
mentioned is not clear. The names ושׁמע בּריעה might be taken fore a
fuller enumeration of the sons of Elpaal ([Ch1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012).md), were it not that the names
enumerated from [Ch1 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014.md) or 15
onwards, are at the end of [Ch1 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#016.md)
said to be those of sons of Beriah; whence we must conclude that with
וּבריעה, [Ch1 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#013.md), a new list of
heads of Benjamite fathers'-houses begins. This view is supported by the
fact that the names from [Ch1 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014.md) or
[Ch1 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#015.md) to [Ch1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#027.md) are divided into five groups of
families: the sons of Beriah ([Ch1
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#016).md), of Elpaal ([Ch1
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#018).md), of Shimhi ([Ch1
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#021).md), of Shashak ([Ch1
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#025).md), and of Jeroham ([Ch1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#027).md). But as two of these, Beriah and
Shashak, occur in [Ch1 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#013.md), [Ch1
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014.md), and שׁמעי is probably another
form of שׁמע, Bertheau conjectures that the last two names, Shashak and
Jeroham, are represented by אחיו and ירמות dna א ([Ch1
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014).md). ירחם and ירמות may be explained
by the supposition of a transcriber's error, or by one person having two
names; but the word אחיו is rendered by the lxx by ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ (=
אהיו); and the view that אחיו is a nom. prop. is opposed, as in [Ch1
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#031.md), by the fact that the ו cop. is
not found before the following שׁשׁק, for here, throughout, the names
are all connected with each other by the w cop. Bertheau therefore
conjectures that the text originally ran thus, ושׁשׁק אהיו ואלפּעל, and
that the name Elpaal was dropped out; and that in consequence of that,
אחיו had been punctuated as a nom. prop. These conjectures seem
satisfactory, especially as it may be adduced in their favour that אהיו
has been added to the name Elpaal to connect the names in [Ch1
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#015.md) with the enumeration ([Ch1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#013).md) interrupted by the parenthetical
remarks. No certainty, however, can be attained in a matter so obscure.
If a new series of groups of families begins with [Ch1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#013.md), we should expect an introductory
formula, as in [Ch1 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006.md). Beriah and
Shema are called heads of the fathers'-houses of the inhabitants of
Aijalon, i.e., heads of the groups of related households inhabiting
Aijalon, the present Jalo to the west of Gibeon (see on [Jos
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#042).md). It is quite consistent with
this that their sons or descendants dwelt in Jerusalem. Next a heroic
deed of theirs is related, viz., that they (in some war or other) turned
to flight the inhabitants of Gath (without doubt Philistines). This
remark reminds us of the statement in [Ch1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021.md), that sons of Ephraim were slain
by those born in Gath, because they had gone down to drive away the
herds of the inhabitants. But Bertheau draws an erroneous conclusion
from this fact, when he says that because in both passages the name
Beriah occurs, both refer to the same event, and thereafter attempts by
various hypotheses to make the Benjamites mentioned in our verse into
Ephraimites. For the name Beriah is not at all so rare as to allow of
our inferring from that alone that the various persons so called are
identical, for Jacob's son Asher also named one of his sons Beriah; cf.
[Ch1 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#030.md) with [Gen
46:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#017.md). The notion that the Benjamites
Beriah and Shema defeated those inhabitants of Gath who had slain the
sons of Ephraim ([Ch1 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021).md) is quite
unsupported, as the Philistines lived at war and in feud with the
Israelites for hundreds of years.

[1 Chronicles 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 8:15</span></span>

Several of the names of these six sons of Beriah who are mentioned in
our verse occur elsewhere, but nowhere else are they met with as sons of
Beriah.

[1 Chronicles 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 8:17</span></span>

Bertheau would identify three of the sons of Elpaal - Meshullam, Heber,
and Ishmerai - with Misham, Eber, and Shemer, [Ch1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012.md), but without any sufficient
reason; for it is questionable if even the Elpaal whose sons are named
in our verses be the same person as the Elpaal mentioned in [Ch1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012.md). Of these descendants of Elpaal,
also, nothing further is known, and the same may be said of the nine
sons of Shimhi, [Ch1 8:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#019.md); of the
eleven sons of Shashak, [Ch1 8:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#022.md);
and of the six sons of Jeroham, [Ch1
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#026.md), [Ch1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#027.md), although some of these names are
met with elsewhere singly. The concluding remark, [Ch1
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#028.md), "These are heads of
fathers'-houses," refers, without doubt, to all the names from [Ch1
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#015.md) or [Ch1
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014.md) to [Ch1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#027.md). "According to their generations
- heads" is in apposition to the preceding, as in [Ch1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#024.md), but the meaning of the
apposition is doubtful. The word ראשׁים can hardly be repeated merely
for emphasis, as the old commentators understood it, in harmony with the
Vulgate principes inquam, for why should this word be so emphasized?
Bertheau thinks that "according to their births - heads" is to be taken
to mean that those who are enumerated by name are not the heads living
at the time of the preparation of this register, but the individual
families, with the name of their progenitor after whom they were named
in the genealogical lists. But how this meaning can be found in the
words in question, I at least cannot understand. Can the individual
families be called אבות ראשׁי, "heads of fathers'-houses"? The families
are the fathers'-houses themselves, i.e., they are made up of the groups
of related households comprehended under the name fathers'-houses. These
groups of related households have, it is true, each of them either head,
but cannot possibly be themselves called heads. The meaning seems rather
to be that the persons named in the family registers, or registers of
births, are introduced as heads (of fathers'-houses); and the reason why
this is remarked would seem to be, to prevent those who are enumerated
as the sons of this or that man from being regarded simply as members of
fathers'-houses. The further remark, "these dwelt in Jerusalem," is
manifestly not to be taken to mean that the heads alone dwelt there,
while the households that were subordinated to them lived elsewhere; for
it signifies that they dwelt in Jerusalem with the households which
composed their respective fathers'-houses. That the households dwelt
there also is not stated, merely because the register contains only the
names of the heads.

[1 Chronicles 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 8:29</span></span>

\_ - [Ch1 8:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md) recur in [Ch1
9:35-44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035) (see on that passage.md).

[Ch1 8:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md)

The ancestors of Saul. They dwelt mainly in Gibeon, but a branch of them
were settled in Jerusalem, [Ch1
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#032.md).f. In Gibeon, now El Jib, two
hours north-west from Jerusalem (see on [Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003).md), dwelt the father of Gibeon, with
his wife and his sons. The plural ישׁבוּ is used because there dwelt
there, besides the father of Gibeon, also his wife and his sons. The
father, i.e., the lord and possessor of Gibeon, was called, according to
[Ch1 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035.md), Jehiel (יעיאל, Keth.
יעואל), and his wife Maachah, a not uncommon female name (see on [Ch1
2:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#048).md). The descent of Jehiel from
Benjamin is not given. In [Ch1 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#030.md)
eight names are given as those of his sons, while in [Ch1
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#036.md). ten are mentioned, the latter
statement being correct; for a comparison of the two passages shows that
in our verse two names have been dropped out, - Ner between Baal and
Nadab, and Mikloth at the end, which must have originally stood in our
register also, - for in [Ch1 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#032.md),
[Ch1 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033.md) their descendants are
mentioned. זכר is called in [Ch1 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#037.md)
זכריה. These names are evidently those of actual sons of Jehiel who were
progenitors of fathers'-houses (groups of related households), but in
the case of only two is the race descended from these further noticed.
In [Ch1 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#032.md) we have that of the
youngest Mikloth, who begat Shimeah, called in [Ch1
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#038.md) Shimeam. These also (viz.,
Shimeah and his family) dwelt in Jerusalem אחיהם נגד, "before their
brethren," i.e., over against them, and אחיהם עם, "with their brethren."
The brethren are the other Benjamites in the first clause, those
dwelling outside of Jerusalem and inhabiting the neighbouring country as
far as Gibeon ([Ch1 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#030).md); in the
second, those dwelling in Jerusalem ([Ch1
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#028).md). From this it is clear that of
the descendants of Abi-Gibeon only that branch which was descended from
Mikloth went to Jerusalem.

[Ch1 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033.md)

The family of Ner. Ner begat Kish, and Kish Saul. According to [Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md) and [Sa1
14:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#051.md), Kish was a son of Abiel. this
statement, on account of which Bertheau proposes to make alterations in
the text, may be reconciled with that in our verses, by the simple
supposition that in our verse intermediate names mentioned in [Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md), and probably others besides, are
passed over, and Ner the son of Abi-Gibeon is named only because he was
the progenitor of the line by which Saul was descended from him. Saul
(שׁאוּל) is King Saul. Only three of his four sons, [Sa1
14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049.md), are mentioned-those, namely,
who fell with him in the battle against the Philistines, [Sa1
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002.md). The second is called, in [Sa1
14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049.md), Ishui, but in [Sa1
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002.md) Abinadab, as in our register,
whence we gather that Ishui is another name for Abinadab. The fourth,
Eshbaal, is the same who is called in [Sa2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md), and elsewhere, Ishbosheth, who
was set up as king in opposition to David by Abner (see on [Sa2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008).md).

[Ch1 8:34-39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#034.md)

Jonathan's sons and grandsons. His son is called here and in [Ch1
9:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#040.md) Meribbaal, while in [Sa2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004.md); [Sa2
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#006.md); [Sa2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001.md)., [Sa2
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#025.md), he is called Mephibosheth,
because the name "striver with Baal" has been changed into מפיבשׁת,
exterminans idolum. This Meribbaal, who was lame in his feet (cf. [Sa2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004).md), had a son Micha (מיכה, in [Sa2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#012) written מיכא.md), of whom came a
numerous race. He had four sons ([Ch1
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#035).md), and the family of the
last-named of these (Ahaz) is traced down, in [Ch1
8:36-40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#036.md), through ten generations to
the great-grandson of Eshek. First it is traced from Ahaz to Alemeth
([Ch1 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#036).md); then through Zimri,
brother of this latter, to Binea, by הוליד; then further by בּנו
(hisson) to Azel, of whom in [Ch1 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#038.md)
six sons are enumerated; and finally, in [Ch1
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#039.md), the sons of his brother Eshek
are named, and the sons and grandsons of the first-born of this latter
are then enumerated. The last two verses are wanting after [Ch1
9:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#044.md). The names in the two registers
correspond, except at one point, where we cannot get rid of the
discrepancy that for יחועדּה ([Ch1
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#036).md) there stands in [Ch1
9:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#042.md) יערה both times, probably through
an error of transcription, by which out of the shortened form יעדּה
there arose יערה, ד and ר being interchanged. Besides this, instead of
the תּארע of [Ch1 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#035.md), we have in
[Ch1 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#041.md), according to the harder
pronunciation of the gutturals, תּחרע; and for רפה, [Ch1
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#037.md), we have in [Ch1
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#041.md) the longer original form רפיה.
Now since Ahaz, whose posterity is traced down to the tenth generation,
was descended from Jonathan in the third generation, and his grandfather
Mephibosheth was a boy of five years of age at the death of Saul and
Jonathan ([Sa2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004).md), the grandsons of
Ulam, mentioned in [Ch1 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040.md), will be
the thirteenth generation of Jonathan's descendants. Now Jonathan fell
along with Saul in the year 1055 b.c., and consequently this thirteenth
generation of Jonathan's descendants lived probably about 700 b.c.,
i.e., about 100 years before the Babylonian exile; for, according to the
analogy of the royal race of David, we cannot reckon more than
twenty-five years on an average for each generation.

(Note: Bertheau holds a contrary opinion to that given in the text, and
thinks that by the numerous sons and grandsons of Ulam the son of Eshek
we are brought down to post-exilic times, seeing that if Saul lived
about 1080 b.c., and thirty years are reckoned to each one of the
thirteen generations (Eshek being a descendant of Saul in the thirteenth
generation), Azel and Eshek must have lived about 690 b.c. But this
estimate is too high, for we cannot reckon sixty years to Saul and
Jonathan from 1080 onwards, since Jonathan fell along with Saul in 1055,
and his son Meribbaal was then hardly five years old, and must
consequently have been born in 1060. For the following generations,
moreover, not more than twenty-five years on an average should be
reckoned. That being the case, the children's children of Ulam's sons,
who were the twelfth generation of Micha's descendants, may have lived
from 760 b.c. onwards, and during this period, from 760 to 700, may have
increased to the troop of blooming grandchildren of Ulam mentioned in
[Ch1 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040.md). But even supposing that
thirty years should be reckoned for each generation, the last-named
generation of 150 grandsons and great-grandsons of Ulam would have lived
in the period from 660 to 600, i.e., before the exile, or at least
before the first great deportation of the people with Jehoiakim in the
year 599 b.c.)

[Ch1 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040.md)

The sons of Ulam are called valiant heroes and archers, and must have
shown the same capability for war by which the tribe of Benjamin had
been distinguished at an earlier time; cf. [Jdg
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016.md), and for קשׁת דּרכי, cf. [Ch1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#016.md). The subscription כּל־אלּה מ
refers back to the superscription in [Ch1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md), and binds all the names in our
chapter together.
