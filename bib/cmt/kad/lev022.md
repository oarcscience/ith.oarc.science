### [Leviticus Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 22:1</span></span>

Reverence for Things Sanctified. - The law on this matter was, (1) that
no priest who had become unclean was to touch or eat them ([Lev
22:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#002)), and (2.md) that no one was to
eat them who was not a member of a priestly family ([Lev
22:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010).md).

[Lev 22:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#002.md)

Aaron and his sons were to keep away from the holy gifts of the children
of Israel, which they consecrated to Jehovah, that they might not
profane the holy name of Jehovah by defiling them הנּזר with מן to keep
away, separate one's self from anything, i.e., not to regard or treat
them as on a par with unconsecrated things. The words, "which they
sanctify to Me," are a supplementary apposition, added as a more precise
definition of the "holy things of the children of Israel;" as the
expression "holy things" was applied to the holy objects universally,
including the furniture of the tabernacle. Here, however, the reference
is solely to the holy offerings or gifts, which were not placed upon the
altar, but presented to the Lord as heave-offerings and wave-offerings,
and assigned by Him to the priests as the servants of His house, for
their maintenance ([Num 18:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#011.md), [Num
18:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#026).md). None of the descendants of
Aaron were to approach these gifts, which were set apart for them, -
i.e., to touch them either for the purpose of eating, or making them
ready for eating, - whilst any uncleanness was upon them, on pain of
extermination.

[Lev 22:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#004.md)

No leper was to touch them (see [Lev
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#002).md), or person with gonorrhaea ([Lev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002).md), until he was clean; no one who
had touched a person defiled by a corpse ([Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028.md); [Num
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#022).md), or whose seed had gone from
him ([Lev 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#016.md), [Lev
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#018).md); and no one who had touched an
unclean creeping animal, or an unclean man. טמאתו לכל, as in [Lev
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#003.md), a closer definition of לו יטמא
אשׁר, "who is unclean to him with regard to (on account of) any
uncleanness which he may have."

[Lev 22:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#006.md)

"A soul which touches it," i.e., any son of Aaron, who had touched
either an unclean person or thing, was to be unclean till the evening,
and then bathe his body; after sunset, i.e., when the day was over, he
became clean, and could eat of the sanctified things, for they were his
food.

[Lev 22:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#008.md)

In this connection the command given to all the Israelites, not to eat
anything that had fallen down dead or been torn in pieces ([Lev
17:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015).md), is repeated with special
reference to the priests. (On. [Lev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#009.md), see [Lev
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035.md); [Lev
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#030.md), and [Lev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017).md). יחלּלהוּ, "because they have
defiled it (the sanctified thing)."

[Lev 22:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010.md)

No stranger was to eat a sanctified thing. זר is in general the
non-priest, then any person who was not fully incorporated into a
priestly family, e.g., a visitor or day-labourer (cf. [Exo
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#049).md), who were neither of them
members of his family.

[Lev 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#011.md)

On the other hand, slaves bought for money, or born in the house, became
members of his family and lived upon his bread; they were therefore
allowed to eat of that which was sanctified along with him, since the
slaves were, in fact, formally incorporated into the nation by
circumcision ([Gen 17:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012).md).

[Lev 22:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#012.md)

So again the daughter of a priest, if she became a widow, or was put
away by her husband, and returned childless to her father's house, and
became a member of his family again, just as in the days of her youth,
might eat of the holy things. But if she had any children, then after
the death of her husband, or after her divorce, she formed with them a
family of her own, which could not be incorporated into the priesthood,
of course always supposing that her husband was not a priest.

[Lev 22:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#014.md)

But if any one (i.e., a layman) should eat unawares of that which was
sanctified, he was to bring it, i.e., an equivalent for it, with the
addition of a fifth as a compensation for the priest; like a man who had
sinned by unfaithfulness in relation to that which was sanctified ([Lev
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016).md). - In the concluding exhortation
in [Lev 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#015.md) and [Lev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#016.md), the subject to יחלּלוּ
(profane) and השּׂאוּ (bear) is indefinite, and the passage to be
rendered thus: "They are not to profane the sanctified gifts of the
children of Israel, what they heave for the Lord (namely, by letting
laymen eat of them), and are to cause them (the laymen) who do this
unawares to bear a trespass-sin (by imposing the compensation mentioned
in [Lev 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#014).md), if they eat their (the
priests') sanctified gifts." Understood in this way, both verses furnish
a fitting conclusion to the section [Lev
22:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010.md). On the other hand, according
to the traditional interpretation of these verses, the priesthood is
regarded as the subject of the first verb, and a negative supplied
before the second. Both of these are arbitrary and quite indefensible,
because [Lev 22:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010.md) do not refer to
the priests but to laymen, and in the latter case we should expect אליהם
ישׂאוּ רלא (cf. [Lev 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#009).md) instead of
the unusual אותם השּׂאוּ.

[Leviticus 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 22:17</span></span>

Acceptable Sacrifices. - [Lev
22:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#018.md). Every sacrifice offered to
the Lord by an Israelite or foreigner, in consequence of a vow or as a
freewill-offering (cf. [Lev 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016).md), was
to be faultless and male, "for good pleasure to the offerer" (cf. [Lev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003).md), i.e., to secure for him the good
pleasure of God. An animal with a fault would not be acceptable.

[Leviticus 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 22:21</span></span>

Every peace-offering was also to be faultless, whether brought "to
fulfil a special (important) vow" (cf. [Num
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#003.md), [Num
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#008.md) : פּלּא, from פּלא to be great,
distinguished, wonderful), or as a freewill gift; that is to say, it was
to be free from such faults as blindness, or a broken limb (from
lameness therefore: [Deu 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#021).md), or
cutting (i.e., mutilation, answering to חרוּם [Lev
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#018).md), or an abscess (יבּלת, from יבל
to flow, probably a flowing suppurating abscess).

[Leviticus 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 22:23</span></span>

As a voluntary peace-offering they might indeed offer an ox or sheep
that was רקלוּט שׂרוּע, "stretched out and drawn together," i.e., with
the whole body or certain limbs either too large or too small;

(Note: In explanation of these words Knobel very properly remarks, that
with the Greeks the sacrificial animal was required to be ἀφελής (Pollux
i. 1, 26), upon which Hesychius observes, μήτε πλεονάζων μήτε δέων τι
τοῦ σώματος.)

but such an animal could not be acceptable as a votive offering.

[Leviticus 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 22:24</span></span>

Castrated animals were not to be sacrificed, nor in fact to be kept in
the land at all. מעוּך compressus, θλιβίας, an animal with the stones
crushed; כּתוּת contusus, θλασίας, with them beaten to pieces; נתוּק
avulsus, σπάδων, with them twisted off; כּרוּי excisus, τομίας or
ἐκτομίας, with them cut off. In all these different ways was the
operation performed among the ancients (cf. Aristot. hist. an. ix. 37,
3; Colum. vi. 26, vii. 11; Pallad. vi. 7). "And in your land ye shall
not make," sc., וגו מעוּך, i.e., castrated animals, that is to say, "not
castrate animals." This explanation, which is the one given by Josephus
(Ant. iv. 8, 40) and all the Rabbins, is required by the expression "in
your land," which does not at all suit the interpretation adopted by
Clericus and Knobel, who understand by עשׂה the preparation of
sacrifices, for sacrifices were never prepared outside the land. The
castration of animals is a mutilation of God's creation, and the
prohibition of it was based upon the same principle as that of mixing
heterogeneous things in [Lev 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019.md).

[Leviticus 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 22:25</span></span>

Again, the Israelites were not to accept any one of all these, i.e., the
faulty animals described, as sacrifice from a foreigner. "For their
corruption is in them," i.e., something corrupt, a fault, adheres to
them; so that such offerings could not procure good pleasure towards
them. - In [Lev 22:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#026.md) three laws
are given of a similar character.

[Leviticus 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 22:27</span></span>

A young ox, sheep, or goat was to be seven days under its mother, and
could only be sacrificed from the eighth day onwards, according to the
rule laid down in [Exo 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029.md) with
regard to the first-born. The reason for this was, that the young animal
had not attained to a mature and self-sustained life during the first
week of its existence.

(Note: For this reason the following rule was also laid down by the
Romans: Suis faetus sacrificio die quinto purus est, pecoris die octavo,
bovis tricesimo (Plin. h. n. 8, 51).)

This maturity was not reached till after the lapse of a week, that
period of time sanctified by the creation. There is no rule laid down in
the law respecting the age up to which an animal was admissible in
sacrifice. Bullocks, i.e., steers or young oxen of more than a year old,
are frequently mentioned and prescribed for the festal sacrifices (for
the young ox of less than a year old is called עגל; [Lev
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#003).md), viz., as burnt-offerings in [Lev
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#018.md); [Num
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#015.md), [Num
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#021.md), [Num
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#027.md), [Num
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#033.md), [Num
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#039.md).; [Num
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#008.md); [Num
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#024.md); [Num
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md), [Num
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019.md), [Num
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#027.md); [Num
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#002.md), [Num
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#008.md), and as sin-offerings in [Lev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md), [Lev
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#014.md); [Lev
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#003); - sheep (lambs.md) of one year old
are also prescribed as burnt-offerings in [Lev
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#003.md); [Lev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006.md); [Lev
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#012.md); [Exo
29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md); [Num

7:39](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#039.md)., [Num
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003.md), [Num
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009.md), [Num
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019.md), [Num
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#027.md); [Num
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#002.md), [Num
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#008.md), [Num
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#013.md), [Num
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#017.md)., as peace-offerings in [Num
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#017.md), [Num
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#023.md); [Num
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035.md)., and as trespass-offerings in
[Num 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#012.md); also a yearling ewe as a
sin-offering in [Lev 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#010.md) and [Num
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#014.md), and a yearling goat in [Num
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#027.md). They generally brought older
oxen or bullocks for peace-offerings ([Num
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#017.md); [Num
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#029)..md), and sometimes as
burnt-offerings. In [Jdg 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025.md) an ox of
seven years old is said to have been brought as a burnt-offering; and
there can be no doubt that the goats and rams presented as sin-offerings
and trespass-offerings were more than a year old.

[Leviticus 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 22:28</span></span>

The command not to kill an ox or sheep at the same time as its young is
related to the law in [Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md) and
[Deu 22:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006.md), and was intended to lay
it down as a duty on the part of the Israelites to keep sacred the
relation which God had established between parent and offspring. - In
[Lev 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#029.md), [Lev
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#030.md), the command to eat the flesh of
the animal on the day on which it was offered ([Lev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015.md); [Lev
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#005).md) is repeated with special
reference to the praise-offering.

[Leviticus 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#031.md)

Concluding exhortation, as in [Lev
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#029.md); [Lev
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#037.md). (On [Lev
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#032.md), cf. [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md) and [Lev
