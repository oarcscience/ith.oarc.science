### [Isaiah Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 57:1</span></span>

Whilst watchmen and shepherds, prophets and rulers, without troubling
themselves about the flock which they have to watch and feed, are thus
indulging their own selfish desires, and living in debauchery, the
righteous man is saved by early death from the judgment, which cannot
fail to come with such corruption as this. "The righteous perisheth, and
no man taketh it to heart; and pious men are swept away, without any one
considering that the righteous is swept away from misfortune. He
entereth into peace: they rest upon their beds, whoever has walked
straight before him." With "the righteous" the prophet introduces, in
glaring contrast to this luxurious living on the part of the leading men
of the nation, the standing figure used to denote the fate of its best
men. With this prevailing demoralization and worldliness, the righteous
succumbs to the violence of both external and internal sufferings. אבד,
he dies before his time ([Ecc 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015).md);
from the midst of the men of his generation he is carried away from this
world ([Psa 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002.md); [Mic
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002).md), and no one lays it to heart,
viz., the divine accusation and threat involved in this early death. Men
of piety (chesed, the love of God and man) are swept away, without there
being any one to understand or consider that (kı̄ unfolds the object to
be considered and laid to heart, viz., what is involved in this carrying
away when regarded as a providential event) the righteous is swept away
"from the evil," i.e., that he may be saved from the approaching
punishment (compare [Kg2 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020).md). For
the prevailing corruption calls for punishment from God; and what is
first of all to be expected is severe judgment, through which the coming
salvation will force its way. In [Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md) it is intimated that the
righteous man and the pious do not lose the blessings of this salvation
because they lose this life: for whereas, according to the prophet's
watchword, there is no peace to the wicked, it is true, on the other
hand, of the departing righteous man, that "he enters into peace"
(shâlōm, acc. loci s. status; Ges. 118, 1); "they rest upon their beds,"
viz., the bottom of the grave, which has become their mishkâb ([Job
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#013.md); [Job
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#026).md), "however has walked in that
which lay straight before him," i.e., the one straight plain path which
he had set before him (נכחו acc. obj. as in [Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md); [Isa
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md), Ewald, 172, b, from נכח, that
which lies straight before a person; whereas נכח with נכח נכחו,
signifying probably fixedness, steadiness of look, related to Arab. nkḥ,
to pierce, נכה, percutere, is used as a preposition: compare [Pro
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#025.md), לנכח, straight or exactly before
him). The grave, when compared with the restlessness of this life, is
therefore "peace." He who has died in faith rests in God, to whom he has
committed himself and entrusted his future. We have here the glimmering
light of the New Testament consolation, that the death of the righteous
is better than life in this world, because it is the entrance into
peace.

[Isaiah 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 57:3</span></span>

The reproachful language of the prophet is now directed against the mass
of the nation, who have occasioned the "evil" from which the righteous
is swept away, i.e., the generation that is hostile to the servants of
Jehovah, and by whom those sins of idolatry are still so shamelessly
carried on, which first led to the captivity. "And ye, draw nearer
hither, children of the sorceress, seed of the adulterer, and of her
that committed whoredom! Over whom do ye make yourselves merry? Over
whom do ye open the mouth wide, and put the tongue out long? Are ye not
the brook of apostasy, seed of lying?" They are to draw nearer hither
(hēnnâh as in [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016).md), to the
place where God is speaking through His prophet, to have themselves
painted, and to hear their sentence. Just as elsewhere the moral
character of a man is frequently indicated by the mention of his father
([Kg2 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#032).md), or his mother ([Sa1
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#030).md), or both parents ([Job
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008).md), so here the generation of the
captivity, so far as it continued to practise the idolatry by which its
ancestors had brought upon themselves the Chaldean catastrophe, is
called first עננה בּני (or more correctly עננה), sons of the sorceress
(possibly the maker of clouds or storm, [Isa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006), Jer. auguratricis.md), one who made
heathen and superstitious customs her means of livelihood, viz., the
community as it existed before the captivity, which really deserved no
better name, on account of the crying contradiction between its calling
and its conduct; and secondly, with regard to both the male and female
members of the community, ותּזנה מנאף זרע, semen adulteri et fornicariae
(Jer.), though Stier, Hahn, and others adopt the rendering semen
adulterum et quod (qui) scortaris. A better rendering than this would
be, "Seed of an adulterer, and one who committest adultery thyself,"
viz., (what would be indicated with this explanation by the fut.
consec.) in consequence of this descent from an adulterer. But as זרע
(seed, posterity), wherever it is more minutely defined, is connected
with a genitive, and not with an adjective, the presumption is that
ותזנה מנאף denotes the father and mother. ותּזנה is an attributive
clause regarded as a genitive (Ges. 123, 3, Anm. 1), and more closely
connected with מנאף htiw than if it was written ותזנה = וזונה, [Isa
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021).md): Seed of an adulterer, and
consequently (Ewald, 351, b), or similarly, of one who gave herself up
to whoredom. Idolatry, prostitution, and magic are most closely allied.
The prophet now asks, "Over whom do ye find your pleasure? For whom are
your common contemptuous actions intended?" התענּג is only used here,
and denotes the feeling which finds pleasure in the sufferings of
another. The objects of this malicious contemptuous pleasure ([Psa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008.md)., [Psa
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021).md) are the servants of Jehovah;
and the question, as in [Isa 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023.md), is
one of amazement at their impudence, since the men over whom they make
merry are really deserving of esteem, whereas they themselves are the
refuse of Israel: Are ye not a brook of apostasy, seed of lying? As
apostasy and lying, when regarded as parents, can only produce something
resembling themselves; the character of those from whom they are
descended is here imputed to the men themselves, even more clearly than
before. The genitives of origin are also genitives of attribute. Instead
of ילדי (e.g., [Isa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006).md) we have here
ילדי before makkeph, with the shortening of a into i.

[Isaiah 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 57:5</span></span>

The participles which follow in the next v. are in apposition to אתּ,
and confirm the predicates already applied to them. They soon give
place, however, to independent sentences. "Ye that inflame yourselves by
the terebinths, under every green tree, ye slayers of children in the
valleys under the clefts of the rocks. By the smooth ones of the brook
was thy portion; they, they were thy lot: thou also pouredst out
libations to them, thou laidst meat-offerings upon them. Shall I be
contented with this?" The people of the captivity are addressed, and the
idolatry handed down to them from their ancestors depicted. The prophet
looks back from the standpoint of the captivity, and takes his colours
from the time in which he himself lived, possibly from the commencement
of Manasseh's reign, when the heathenism that had for a long time been
suppressed burst forth again in all its force, and the measure of
iniquity became full. The part. niphal הנּחמים is formed like נחן in
[Jer 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023.md), if the latter signifies
miserandum esse. The primary form is נחם, which is doubled like נגּר
from גּרר in [Job 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#028.md), and from
which נחם is formed by the resolution of the latent reduplication. Stier
derives it from; but even if formed from this, נחם would still have to
be explained from נחם, after the form נצּת. 'Elı̄m signifies either gods
or terebinths. But although it might certainly mean idols, according to
[Exo 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md); [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036) (lxx, Targ., and Jerome.md), it is
never used directly in this sense, and Isaiah always uses the word as
the name of a tree ([Isa 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md); [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003).md). The terebinths are introduced
here, exactly as in [Isa 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md), as an
object of idolatrous lust: "who inflame themselves with the terebinths;"
ב denotes the object with which the lust is excited and inf Lamed. The
terebinth ('ēlâh) held the chief place in tree-worship (hence אלנם,
lit., oak-trees, together with אלם, is the name of one of the Phoenician
gods),

(Note: See Levy, Phnizische Studien, i. 19.)

possibly as being the tree sacred to Astarte; just as the Samura Acacia
among the heathen Arabs was the tree sacred to the goddess 'Uzza.

(Note: Krehl, Religioin der vorisl. Araber, p. 74ff.)

The following expression, "under every green tree," is simply a
permutative of the words "with the terebinths" in the sense of "with the
terebinths, yea, under every green tree" (a standing expression from
[Deu 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002) downwards.md) - one tree being
regarded as the abode and favourite of this deity, and another of that,
and all alluring you to your carnal worship.

From the tree-worship with its orgies, which was so widely spread in
antiquity generally, the prophet passes to the leading Canaanitish
abomination, viz., human sacrifices, which had been adopted by the
Israelites (along with שׁחטי we find the false reading שׂחטי, which is
interpreted as signifying self-abuse). Judging from the locality named,
"under the clefts of the rocks," the reference is not to the slaying of
children sacrificed to Moloch in the valley of Hinnom, but to those
offered to Baal upon his bâmōth or high places ([Jer
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005.md); [Eze
16:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020.md); [Hos
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md); [Psa
106:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037).md). As we learn from the
chronique scandaleuse many things connected with the religious history
of Israel, which cannot be found in its historical books, there is
nothing to surprise us in the stone-worship condemned in [Isa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#006.md). The dagesh of חלּקי is in any
case dagesh dirimens. The singular is wither חלק after the form חכמי
(cf., עצבי, [Isa 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003).md), or חלק after
the form ילדי. But חלק, smoothness, never occurs; and the explanation,
"in the smoothnesses, i.e., the smooth places of the valley, is thy
portion," has this also against it, that it does not do justice to the
connection בּ חלק, in which the preposition is not used in a local
sense, and that it leaves the emphatic הם הם quite unexplained. The
latter does not point to places, but to objects of worship for which
they had exchanged Jehovah, of whom the true Israelite could say ה חלקי,
[Psa 119:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#057.md), etc., or בה לי חלק, [Jos
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#025.md), and גּורלי תּומיך אתּה (Thou
art He that maintaineth my lot), [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md). The prophet had such expressions
as these in his mind, and possibly also the primary meaning of גורל =
κλῆρος, which may be gathered from the rare Arabic word 'garal, gravel,
stones worn smooth by rolling, when he said, "In the smooth ones of the
valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot." In the Arabic also,
achlaq (equilvaent to châlâq, smooth, which forms here a play upon the
word with חלק, châlâq) is a favourite word for stones and rocks.
חלּקי־נחל, however, according to [Sa1
17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040.md) (where the intensive form
חלּוּק, like שׁכּוּל, is used), are stones which the stream in the
valley has washed smooth with time, and rounded into a pleasing shape.
The mode of the worship, the pouring out of libations,

(Note: Compare the remarks made in the Comm. on the Pentateuch, at [Gen
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#020.md), on the heathen worship of
anointed stones, and the Baetulian worship.)

and the laying of meat-offerings upon them, confirm this view. In
Carthage such stones were called abbadires (= אדיר, אבן); and among the
ancient Arabs, the asnâm or idols consisted for the most part of rude
blocks of stone of this description. Herodotus (3:8) speaks of seven
stones which the Arabs anointed, calling upon the god Orotal. Suidas
(s.v. Θεῦς ἄρης) states that the idol of Ares in Petra was a black
square stone; and the black stone of the Ka'aba was, according to a very
inconvenient tradition for the Mohammedans, an idol of Saturn (zuhal).

(Note: See Krehl, p. 72. In the East Indies also we find stone-worship
not only among the Vindya tribes (Lassen, A.K. i. 376), but also among
the Vaishnavas, who worship Vishnu in the form of a stone, viz., the
sâlagrâm, a kind of stone from the river Gandak (see Wilson's Sanscrit
Lexicon s.h.v. and Vishnu-Purn, p. 163). The fact of the great antiquity
of stone and tree worship has been used in the most ridiculous manner by
Dozy in his work on the Israelites at Mecca (1864). He draws the
following conclusion from [Deu 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018.md) :
"Thus the Israelites sprang from a divine block of stone; and this is,
in reality, the true old version of the origin of the nation." From [Isa
51:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md), he infers that Abraham and
Sara were not historical persons at all, but that the former was a block
of stone, and the latter a hollow; and that the two together were a
block of stone in a hollow, to which divine worship was paid. "This
fact," he says, "viz. that Abraham and Sarah in the second Isaiah are
not historical persons, but a block of stone and a hollow, is one of
great worth, as enabling us to determine the time at which the stories
of Abraham in Genesis were written, and to form a correct idea of the
spirit of those stories.")

Stone-worship of this kind had been practised by the Israelites before
the captivity, and their heathenish practices had been transmitted to
the exiles in Babylon. The meaning of the question, Shall I comfort
myself concerning such things? - i.e., Shall I be contented with them
(אנּחם niphal, not hithpael)? - is, that it was impossible that
descendants who so resembled their fathers should remain unpunished.

[Isaiah 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 57:7</span></span>

The prophet now proceeds with perfects, like שׁפכתּ and העלית (addressed
to the national community generally, the congregation regarded as a
woman). The description is mostly retrospective. "Upon a lofty and high
mountain hast thou set up thy bed; thou also ascendedst thither to offer
slain offerings. And behind the door and the post thou didst place thy
reminder: for thou uncoveredst away from me, and ascendedst; thou madest
thy bed broad, and didst stipulate for thyself what they had to do: thou
lovedst their lying with thee; thou sawest their manhood." The lovers
that she sought for herself are the gods of the heathen. Upon lofty
mountains, where they are generally worshipped, did she set up her bed,
and did all that was needed to win their favour. The zikkârōn, i.e., the
declaration that Jehovah is the only God, which the Israelites were to
write upon the posts of their houses, and upon the entrances ([Deu
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009.md); [Deu
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#020).md), for a constant reminder, she
had put behind the door and post, that she might not be reminded, to her
shame, of her unfaithfulness. That this explanation, which most of the
commentators adopt, is the true one, is proved by the expression מאתּי
כּי which follows, and according to which זכרון is something
inconvenient, which might and was intended to remind them of Jehovah.
מאתּי, away, far from me, as in [Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md), and like מתּחתּי, which is still
more frequently used. It is unnecessary to take gillı̄th with ערותך
understood ([Eze 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#018).md) as equivalent
to "thou makest thyself naked," or with reference to the clothes =
ἀνασύρεις. משׁכּב is the common object of all three verbs, even of
ותּעלי (with double metheg), after [Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004.md). On ותּכרת for ותּכרתי (cf., [Jer
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005).md), see Ewald, 191, b. The
explanation "thou didst bind," or "thou didst choose (some) of them to
thyself," is contrary to the general usage, according to which ל כּרת
signifies spondere ([Ch2 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#018).md), and
(עם כּרת pacisci ([Sa1 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#008).md), in both
cases with בּרית to be supplied, so that מן (בּרית) כּרת would mean
stipulari ab aliquo, i.e., to obtain from a person a solemn promise,
with all the force of a covenant. What she stipulated from them was,
either the wages of adultery, or the satisfaction of her wanton lust.
What follows agrees with this; for it is there distinctly stated, that
the lovers to whom she offered herself gratified her lust abundantly:
adamasti concutibum eorum (mishkâb, cubile, e.g., [Pro
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017.md), and concubitus, e.g., Ezra
23:17), manum conspexisit. The Targum and Jewish commentators adopt this
explanation, loco quem delegisti, or (postquam) locum delegisti. This
also is apparently the meaning of the accents, and most of the more
modern commentators have adopted it, taking יד in the sense of place or
side. But this yields only a very lame and unmeaning thought. Doederlein
conjectured that יד was employed here in the sense of ἰθύφαλλος; and
this is the explanation adopted by Hitzig, Ewald, and others. The Arabic
furnishes several analogies to this obscene use of the word; and by the
side of [Eze 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#026.md) and [Eze
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#020.md), where the same thing is
affirmed in even plainer language, there is nothing to astonish in the
passage before us. The meaning is, that after the church of Jehovah had
turned away from its God to the world and its pleasures, it took more
and more delight in the pleasures afforded it by idolatry, and indulged
its tastes to the full.

[Isaiah 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 57:9</span></span>

In the closest reciprocal connection with this God-forgetting,
adulterous craving for the favour of heathen gods, stood their
coquetting with the heathen power of the world. "And thou wentest to the
king with oil, and didst measure copiously thy spices, and didst send
thy messengers to a great distance, and didst deeply abase thyself, even
to Hades. Thou didst become weary of the greatness of thy way; yet thou
saidst not, It is unattainable: thou obtainedst the revival of thy
strength: therefore thou wast not pained." The first thing to be noticed
here, is one that has been overlooked by nearly all the modern
commentators, viz., that we have here a historical retrospect before us.
And secondly, a single glance at [Isa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011.md) is sufficient to show that the
words refer to a servile coquetry from the fear of man, and therefore to
a wicked craving for the favour of man; so that "the king," is not Baal,
or any heathen god whatever (according to [Isa
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#021.md) and [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005).md), but the Asiatic ruler of the
world. Ahaz sent messengers, as we read in [Kg2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md)., to Tiglath-pileser, the king of
Assyria, to say to Him, "I am thy servant and thy son." And Ahaz took
the silver and gold that were in the house of Jehovah, and in the
treasures of the palace, and sent a bribe to the king of Assyria. And
again, at [Kg2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md)., Ahaz went to
Damascus to meet the king of Assyria, and there he saw an altar, and
sent a model of it to Jerusalem, and had one like it put in the place of
the altar of burnt-offering. Such acts as these are here described in
the figure of Israel travelling with oil to the king, and taking a
quantity of choice spices with it to gain his favour, and also sending
messengers, and not only bowing itself to the earth, but even stooping
to Hades, that is to say, standing as it were on its head in its
excessive servility, for the purpose of obtaining allies. It seems most
natural to take בּשׁמן as equivalent to בשמן משׁוּחה: thou wentest in
oil (dripping with pomade), and didst apply to thyself many spices; but
Beth after verbs of going signifies to go with anything, to take it with
one and bring it, so that the oil and spices are thought of here as
presents, which she took with her as sensual stimulants, with a view to
the amorous pleasures she was seeking ([Eze
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#041.md), cf., [Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002).md). השׁפּיל signifies to go deep
down in [Jer 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#018.md); the meaning here
is, to bow very low, or to degrade one's self. By "the greatness or
breadth of the way" (a similar expression to that in [Jos
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#013).md), all the great sacrifices are
intended which it cost her to purchase the favour of the heathen ruler.
Although they were a great trouble to her, yet she did not say נואש, "it
is hopeless;" the niphal of יאשׁ signifies in [Sa1
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001.md), to betake one's self to a thing
with despair of its success. The participle in [Job
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#026.md) means a despairing person; it
also occurs in a neuter sense in [Jer
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026.md); [Jer
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md), viz., given up, i.e.,
absolutely in vain. She did not give up hope, although the offerings
nearly exhausted her strength; on the contrary, she gained יד חיּת,
"life of her arm," i.e., (according to the use of חיה in the sense of
reviving, and החיה, to bring to life again) new life in her arm, in
other words, "the renewing of her strength" (recentem vigorem virium
suarum). Thus, without noticing the sighs and groans forced from her by
the excessive toil and fatigue, but stirring herself up again and again,
she pursued the plan of strengthening her alliances with the heathen.
Ezekiel's picture of Aholah and Aholibah is like a commentary on [Isa
57:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003) (see Ezek 23.md).

[Isaiah 57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 57:11</span></span>

From fear of man, Israel, and still more Judah, had given up the fear of
Jehovah. "And of whom hast thou been afraid, and (whom) didst thou fear,
that thou becamest a liar, and didst not continue mindful of me, and
didst not take it to heart?" It was of men - only mortal men, with no
real power ([Isa 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012).md) - that Israel
was so needlessly afraid, that it resorted to lies and treachery to
Jehovah (kı̄, ut, an interrogative sentence, as in [Sa2
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018.md); [Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005).md): purchasing the favour of man out
of the fear of man, and throwing itself into the arms of false tutelar
deities, it banished Jehovah its true shelter out of its memory, and did
not take it to heart, viz., the sinfulness of such infidelity, and the
eventful consequences by which it was punished (compare [Isa
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#007.md) and [Isa
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025).md).

With [Isa 57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011.md) the reproaches are
addressed to the present. The treachery of Israel had been severely
punished in the catastrophe of which the captivity was the result, but
without effecting any improvement. The great mass of the people were as
forgetful of God as ever, and would not be led to repentance by the
long-suffering of God, which had hitherto spared them from other
well-merited punishments. "Am I not silent, and that for a long time,
whereas thou wast not afraid of me?" A comparison with [Isa
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014.md) will show that the prophecy
returns here to its ordinary style. The lxx and Jerome render the
passage as if the reading were מעלם (viz., עיני = παρορῶν, quasi non
videns), and this is the reading which Lowth adopts. We may see from
this, that the original text had a defective ומעלם, which was intended,
however, to be read וּמעלם. The prophet applies the term ‛ōlâm (see [Isa
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014).md) to the captivity, which had
already lasted a long time - a time of divine silence: the silence of
His help so fas as the servants of Jehovah were concerned, but the
silence of His wrath as to the great mass of the people.

[Isaiah 57:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 57:12</span></span>

But this silence would not last for ever. "I will proclaim thy
righteousness; and thy works, they will not profit thee. When thou
criest, let thy heaps of idols save thee: but a wind carries them all
away; a breath takes them off; and whoever putteth trust in me will
inherit the land, and take possession of my holy mountain." According to
the context, צדקתך cannot be a synonym of ישׁוּעה f here. It is neither
salvation nor the way of salvation that is intended; nor is this even
included, as Stier supposes. But the simple reference is to what Israel
in its blindness regarded as righteousness; whereas, if it had known
itself, it would have seen that it was the most glaring opposite. This
lying-righteousness of Israel would be brought to a judicial exposure by
Jehovah. ואת־מעשׂיך is not a second accusative to אגּיד, for in that
case we should have ומעשׂיך את־צדקתך; but it commences a second
sentence, as the accents really indicate. When Jehovah begins thus to
speak and act, the impotence of the false gods which His people have
made for themselves will soon be exposed; and "as for thy works (i.e.,
thine idols, [Isa 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029.md), cf., [Isa
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#031).md), they will do thee no good"
([Isa 44:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009.md), compare [Jer
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033); for the question מה־משׂא.md), here
an empatic elevation of the subject, compare [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008), ואת־דורו, Ewald, 277, p. 683.md).
This determines the meaning of קבּוּציך, which Knobel supposes to refer
to the large army of the Babylonians, with which the apostates among the
exiles had formed an offensive and defensive alliance. But the term is
really applied to the heaps (qibbūts, collectio, not an adjective of the
form limmūd) of different idols, with which Israel had furnished itself
even in its captivity (compare qibbâtsâh in [Mic
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#007).md). It was in vain for them to turn
to these pantheons of theirs; a single rūăch would carry them all away,
a hebhel would sweep them off, for they themselves were nothing but
hebhel and rūăch ([Isa 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029).md). The
proper punctuation here is יקּח־הבל; the first syllable of יקח, which is
attached to a word with a disjunctive accent, has a so-called heavy
Gaya, the second a euphonic Gaya, according to rules which are too
little discussed in our grammars. When Knobel supports his explanation
of קבוציך on the ground that the idols in [Isa
57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013.md) and the worshippers of Jehovah
in [Isa 57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013.md) do not form a fitting
antithesis, the simple reply is, that the contrast lies between the
idols, which cannot save, and Jehovah, who not only saves those who
trust in Him, but sends them prosperity according to His promises. With
the promise, "Whoso trusts in me will inherit the land," this prophecy
reaches the thought with which the previous prophecy ([Isa
51:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007).md) closed; and possibly what is
here affirmed of קבּוּציך forms an intentional antithesis to the promise
there, לנקבּציו עליו אקבּץ עוד: when Jehovah gathers His faithful ones
from the dispersion, and gathers others to them (from among the
heathen), then will the plunder which the faithless have gathered
together be all scattered to the winds. And whilst the latter stand
forsaken by their powerless works, the former will be established in the
peaceful inheritance of the promised land. The first half of the
prophecy closes here. It is full of reproach, and closes with a brief
word of promise, which is merely the obverse of the threat. The second
half follows an opposite course. Jehovah will redeem His people,
provided it has been truly humbled by the sufferings appointed, for He
has seen into what errors it has fallen since He has withdrawn His mercy
from it. "But the wicked," etc. The whole closes here with words of
threatening, which are the obverse of the promise. [Isa
57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013.md) forms the transition from the
first half to the second.

[Isaiah 57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 57:14</span></span>

The promise is now followed by a appeal to make ready the way which the
redeemed people have to take. "And He saith, Heap up, heap up, prepare a
way, take away every obstruction from the way of my people." This is the
very same appeal which occurs once in all three books of these
prophecies ([Isa 40:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md); [Isa
57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014.md); [Isa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010).md). The subject of the verb
('âmar) is not Jehovah; but the prophet intentionally leaves it obscure,
as in [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md), [Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md) (cf., [Isa
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#002).md). It is a heavenly cry; and the
crier is not to be more precisely named.

[Isaiah 57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 57:15</span></span>

The primary ground for this voice being heard at all is, that the Holy
One is also the Merciful One, and not only has a manifestation of glory
on high, but also a manifestation of grace below. "For thus saith the
high and lofty One, the eternally dwelling One, He whose name is Holy
One; I dwell on high and in the holy place, and with the contrite one
and him that is of a humbled spirit, to revive the spirit of humbled
ones, and to revive the heart of contrite ones." He inflicts punishment
in His wrath; but to those who suffer themselves to be urged thereby to
repentance and the desire for salvation, He is most inwardly and most
effectually near with His grace. For the heaven of heavens is not too
great for Him, and a human heart is not too small for Him to dwell in.
And He who dwells upon cherubim, and among the praises of seraphim, does
not scorn to dwell among the sighs of a poor human soul. He is called
râm (high), as being high and exalted in Himself; נשּׂא (the lofty One),
as towering above all besides; and עד שׁכן. This does not mean the
dweller in eternity, which is a thought quite outside the biblical range
of ideas; but, since עד stands to שׁכן not in an objective, but in an
attributive or adverbial relation ([Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md), cf., [Pro
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#033).md), and שׁכן, as opposed to being
violently wrested from the ordinary sphere of life and work (cf., [Psa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009); 102:29.md), denotes a continuing
life, a life having its root in itself, עד שׁכן must mean the eternally
(= לעד) dwelling One, i.e., He whose life lasts for ever and is always
the same. He is also called qâdōsh, as One who is absolutely pure and
good, separated from all the uncleanness and imperfection by which
creatures are characterized. This is not to be rendered sanctum nomen
ejus, but sanctus; this name is the facit of His revelation of Himself
in the history of salvation, which is accomplished in love and wrath,
grace and judgment. This God inhabits mârōm veqâdōsh, the height and the
Holy Place (accusatives of the object, like mârōm in [Isa
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#005.md), and merōmı̄m in [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016).md), both together being equivalent
to φῶς ἀπρόσιτον ([Ti1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016).md), since
qâdōsh (neuter, as in [Psa 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md); [Psa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005).md) answers to φῶς, and mârōm to
ἀπρόσιτον. But He also dwells with (את as in [Lev
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#016).md) the crushed and lowly of
spirit. To these He is most intimately near, and that for a salutary and
gracious purpose, namely "to revive ... ." ההיהe and היּה always signify
either to keep that which is living alive, or to restore to life that
which is dead. The spirit is the seat of pride and humility, the heart
the seat of all feeling of joy and sorrow; we have therefore spiritum
humilium and cor contritorum. The selfish egotism which repentance
breaks has its root in the heart; and the self-consciousness, from whose
false elevation repentance brings down, has its seat in the spirit
(Psychol. p. 199).

[Isaiah 57:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 57:16</span></span>

The compassion, by virtue of which God has His abode and His work of
grace in the spirit and heart of the penitent, is founded in that free
anticipating love which called man and his self-conscious spirit-soul
into being at the first. "For I do not contend for ever, and I am not
angry for ever: for the spirit would pine away before me, and the souls
of men which I have created." The early translators (lxx, Syr., Jer.,
possibly also the Targum) give to יעטף the meaning egredietur, which
certainly cannot be established. And so also does Stier, so far as the
thought is concerned, when he adopts the rendering, "A spirit from me
will cover over, and breath of life will I make;" and so Hahn, "When the
spirit pines away before me, I create breath in abundance." But in both
cases the writer would at any rate have used the perf. consec. ועשׂיתי,
and the last clause of the v. has not the syntactic form of an apodosis.
The rendering given above is the only one that is unassailable both
grammatically and in fact. כּי introduces the reason for the
self-limitation of the divine wrath, just as in [Psa
78:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038.md) (cf., [Psa
103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014).md): if God should put no
restraint upon His wrath, the consequence would be the entire
destruction of human life, which was His creative work at first. The
verb עטף, from its primary meaning to bend round (Comm. on Job, at [Job
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009).md), has sometimes the transitive
meaning to cover, and sometimes the meaning to wrap one's self round,
i.e., to become faint or weak (compare עטוּף, fainted away, [Lam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019.md); and התעטּף in [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004.md), which is applied to the spirit,
like the kal here). מלּפני is equivalent to "in consequence of the wrath
proceeding from me." נשׁמות (a plural only met with here) signifies,
according to the fixed usage of the Old Testament ([Isa
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#022.md); [Isa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005).md), the souls of men, the origin of
which is described as a creation in the attributive clause (with an
emphatic אני), just as in [Jer 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#016.md)
(cf., [Zac 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001).md). Whether the accents
are intended to take עשׂיתי אני in this attributive sense or not, cannot
be decided from the tiphchah attached to ונשׁמות. The prophet, who
refers to the flood in other passages also (e.g., [Isa
54:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009).md), had probably in his mind the
promise given after the flood, according to which God would not make the
existing and inherited moral depravity an occasion for utterly
destroying the human race.

[Isaiah 57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 57:17</span></span>

This general law of His action is most especially the law of His conduct
towards Israel, in which such grievous effects of its well-deserved
punishment are apparent, and effects so different from those intended,
that the compassion of God feels impelled to put an end to the
punishment for the good of all that are susceptible of salvation. "And
because of the iniquity of its selfishness, I was wroth, and smote it;
hiding myself, and being angry: then it went on, turning away in the way
of its own heart. I have seen its ways, and will heal it; and will lead
it, and afford consolations to it, and to its mourning ones." The
fundamental and chief sin of Israel is here called בּצע, lit., a cut of
slice (= gain, [Isa 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011).md); then, like
πλεονεξία, which is "idolatry" according to [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md), or like φιλαργυρία, which is "the
root of all evil" according to [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md), greedy desire for worldly
possession, self-seeking, or worldliness generally. The future ואכּהוּ,
standing as it does by the side of the perfect here, indicates that
which is also past; and ואקצף stands in the place of a second gerund:
abscondendo (viz., pânai, my face, [Isa
54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008).md) et stomachando. When Jehovah had
thus wrathfully hidden His gracious countenance from Israel, and
withdrawn His gracious presence out of the midst of Israel ([Hos
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006), מהם חל.md), it went away from Him
(שׁובב with שׁובב, like עולל with עולל), going its own ways like the
world of nations that had been left to themselves. But Jehovah had not
seen these wanderings without pity. The futures which follow are
promising, not by virtue of any syntactic necessity, but by virtue of an
inward necessity. He will heal His wounded ([Isa
1:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004).md) and languishing people, and
lead in the right way those that are going astray, and afford them
consolation as a recompense for their long sufferings (נחוּמים is
derived from the piel נחם, and not, as in [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md), from the hiphal hinnâchēm, in
the sense of "feelings of sympathy"), especially (Vav epexeget.; Ges.
155, 1) its mourning ones ([Isa
61:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md); [Isa
66:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#010).md), i.e., those who punishment has
brought to repentance, and rendered desirous of salvation.

[Isaiah 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 57:19</span></span>

But when the redemption comes, it will divide Israel into two halves,
with very different prospects. "Creating fruit of the lips; Jehovah
saith, 'Peace, peace to those that are far off, and to those that are
near; and I heal it.' But the wicked are like the sea that is cast up
for it cannot rest, and its waters cast out slime and mud. There is no
peace, saith my God, for the wicked." The words of God in [Isa
57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md) are introduced with an
interpolated "inquit Jehova" (cf., [Isa
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md), and the ellipsis in [Isa
41:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#027).md); and what Jehovah effects by
speaking thus is placed first in a determining participial clause:
"Creating fruit (נוב = נוּב, נוב, keri ניב) of the lips," καρπὸν χείλεων
(lxx, [Heb 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015).md), i.e., not of His
own lips, to which בּורא would be inapplicable, but the offering of
praise and thanksgiving springing from human lips (for the figure, see
Psychol. p. 214, trans.; and on the root נב, to press upon forward):
"Jehovah saith shâlōm, shâlōm," i.e., lasting and perfect peace (as in
[Isa 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003).md), "be the portion of those
of my people who are scattered far and near" ([Isa
43:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005.md); [Isa
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#012.md); compare the application to
heathen and Jews in [Eph 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017).md); "and I
heal it" (viz., the nation, which, although scattered, is like one
person in the sight of God). But the wicked, who persist in the
alienation from God inherited from the fathers, are incapable of the
peace which God brings to His people: they are like the sea in its
tossed and stormy state (נגרשׁ pausal third pers. as an attributive
clause). As this cannot rest, and as its waters cast out slime and mud,
so has their natural state become one of perpetual disturbance, leading
to the uninterrupted production of unclean and ungodly thoughts, words,
and works. Thus, then, there is no peace for them, saith my God. With
these words, which have even a more pathetic sound here than in [Isa
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022.md), the prophet seals the second
book of his prophecies. The "wicked" referred to are not the heathen
outside Israel, but the heathen, i.e., those estranged from God, within
Israel itself.

The transition form the first to the second half of this closing
prophecy is formed by ואמר in [Isa
57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014.md). In the second half, from [Isa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011.md), we find the accustomed style of
our prophet; but in Isaiah 56:9-57:11a the style is so thoroughly
different, that Ewald maintains that the prophet has here inserted in
his book a fragment from some earlier writer of the time of Manasseh.
But we regard this as very improbable. It is not required by what is
stated concerning the prophets and shepherds, for the book of Ezekiel
clearly shows that the prophets and shepherds of the captivity were thus
debased. Still less does what is stated concerning the early death of
the righteous require it; for the fundamental idea of the suffering
servant of Jehovah, which is peculiar to the second book, is shadowed
forth therein. Nor by what is affirmed as to the idolatrous conduct of
the people; for in the very centre ([Isa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#004).md) the great mass of the people are
reproached for their contemptuous treatment of the servants of Jehovah.
Nor does the language itself force us to any such conjecture, for [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md) also differs from the style
met with elsewhere; and yet (although Ewald regards it as an earlier,
borrowed fragment) it must be written by the author of the whole, since
its grandest idea finds its fullest expression there. At the same time,
we may assume that the prophet described the idolatry of the people
under the influences of earlier models. If he had been a prophet of the
captives after the time of Isaiah, he would have rested his prophecies
on Jeremiah and Ezekiel. For just as [Isa
51:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#018.md). has the ring of the
Lamentations of Jeremiah, so does [Isa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003.md). resemble in many respects the
earlier reproaches of Jeremiah (compare [Jer
5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md), [Jer
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#029.md); [Jer
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#008.md), with the expression, "Should I
rest satisfied with this?"); also [Jer
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025) (נואשׁ.md), [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md), [Jer
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#013.md) ("upon lofty mountains and under
green trees"); also the night scene in Ezek 23.
