A Sure Stronghold Is Our God

(Note: "Ein feste Burg is unser Gott.")

When, during the reign of Jehoshaphat, the Moabites, Ammonites, and
Edomites (more particularly the Maonites, for in [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001) it is to be read מהמּעוּנים.md)
carried war into the kingdom of David and threatened Jerusalem, the
Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziכl the Asaphite in the temple
congregation which the king had called together, and he prophesied a
miraculous deliverance on the morrow. Then the Levite singers praised
the God of Israel with jubilant voice, viz., singers of the race of
Kohaath, and in fact out of the family of Korah. On the following day
Levite singers in holy attire and with song went forth before the army
of Jehoshaphat. The enemy, surprised by the attack of another plundering
band of the sons of the desert, had turned their weapons against one
another, being disbanded in the confusion of flight, and the army of
Jehoshaphat found the enemy's camp turned into a field of corpses. In
the feast of thanksgiving for victory which followed in Emek ha-Beracha
the Levite singers again also took an active part, for the spoil-laden
army marched thence in procession to Jerusalem and to the temple of
Jahve, accompanied by the music of the nablas, citherns, and trumpets.
Thus in the narrative in [Ch2 22:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)
does the chronicler give us the key to the Asaphic Ps 83 (76?) and to
the Korahitic Ps 46-48. It is indeed equally admissible to refer these
three Korahitic Psalms to the defeat of Sennacherib's army under
Hezekiah, but this view has not the same historical consistency. After
the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign the congregation could certainly
not help connecting the thought of the Assyrian catastrophe so recently
experienced with this Psalm; and more especially since Isaiah had
predicted this event, following the language of this Psalm very closely.
For Isaiah and this Psalm are remarkably linked together.

Just as [Psa 2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md) is, as it were,
the quintessence of the book of Immanuel, [Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md), so is [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md) of Isa. 33, that concluding
discourse to [Isa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md), which is
moulded in a lyric form, and was uttered before the deliverance of
Jerusalem at a time of the direst distress. The fundamental thought of
the Psalm is expressed there in [Psa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002.md) in the form of a petition; and by
a comparison with [Isa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md). we may
see what a similarity there is between the language of the psalmist and
of the prophet. [Isa 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013.md) closely
resembles the concluding admonition; and the image of the stream in the
Psalm has suggested the grandly bold figure of the prophet in v. 21,
which is there more elaborately wrought up: "No indeed, there dwells for
us a glorious One, Jahve - a place of streams, of canals of wide extent,
into which no fleet of rowing vessels shall venture, and which no mighty
man-of-war shall cross." The divine determination expressed in ארוּם we
also hear in [Isa 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010.md). And the
prospect of the end of war reminds us of the familiar prediction of
Isaiah (Isa 2), closely resembling Micah's in its language, of eternal
peace; just as [Psa 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#008.md), [Psa
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#011.md) remind us of the watch-word עמנו
אל in [Isa 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md). The mind of Isaiah and
that of Jeremiah have, each in its own peculiar way, taken germs of
thought (lit., become impregnated) from this Psalm.

We have already incidentally referred to the inscribed words על־עלמות,
on [Psa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md). Bttcher renders them ad
voces puberes, "for tenor voices," a rendering which certainly accords
with the fact that, according to [Ch1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020.md), they were accustomed to sing
בּנבלים על־עלמות, and the Oriental sounds, according to Villoteau
(Description de l'Egypte), correspond aux six sons vers l'aigu de
l'octave du medium de la voix de tenor. But עלמות does not signify voces
puberes, but puellae puberes (from עלם, Arab. glm, cogn. חלם, Arab. ḥlm,
to have attained to puberty); and although certainly no eunuchs sang in
the temple, yet there is direct testimony that Levite youths were among
the singers in the second temple;

(Note: The Mishna, Erachin 13b, expressly informs us, that whilst the
Levites sang to the accompanying play of the nablas and citherns, their
youths, standing at their feet below the pulpit, sang with them in order
to give to the singing the harmony of high and deep voices (תּבל,
condimentum). These Levite youths are called צערי or סועדי הלויים,
parvuli (although the Gemara explains it otherwise) or adjutores
Levitarum.)

and Ps 68 mentions the עלמות who struck the timbrels at a temple
festival. Moreover, we must take into consideration the facts that the
compass of the tenor extends even into the soprano, that the singers
were of different ages down to twenty years of age, and that Oriental,
and more particularly even Jewish, song is fond of falsetto singing. We
therefore adopt Perret-Gentil's rendering, chant avec voix de femmes,
and still more readily Armand de Mestral's, en soprano; whereas
Melissus' rendering, "upon musical instruments called Alamoth (the
Germans would say, upon the virginal)," has nothing to commend it.

[Psalms 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 46:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 46:2-4) The congregation begins with a general declaration of
that which God is to them. This declaration is the result of their
experience. Luther, after the lxx and Vulg., renders it, "in the great
distresses which have come upon us." As though נמצא could stand for
הנּמצעות, and that this again could mean anything else but "at present
existing," to which מאד is not at all appropriate. God Himself is called
נמצא מאד as being one who allows Himself to be found in times of
distress ([Ch2 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#004), and frequently.md)
exceedingly; i.e., to those who then seek Him He reveals Himself and
verifies His word beyond all measure. Because God is such a God to them,
the congregation or church does not fear though a still greater distress
than that which they have just withstood, should break in upon them: if
the earth should change, i.e., effect, enter upon, undergo or suffer a
change (an inwardly transitive Hiphil, Ges. ֗53, 2); and if the
mountains should sink down into the heart (בּלב exactly as in [Eze
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#027.md); [Jon
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#004)) of the sea (ocean.md), i.e., even if
these should sink back again into the waters out of which they appeared
on the third day of the creation, so that consequently the old chaos
should return. The church supposes the most extreme case, viz., the
falling in of the universe which has been creatively set in order. We
are no more to regard the language as being allegorical here (as
Hengstenberg interprets it, the mountains being = the kingdoms of the
world), than we would the language of Horace: si fractus illabatur orbis
(Carm. iii. 3, 7). Since ימּים is not a numerical but amplificative
plural, the singular suffixes in [Psa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md) may the more readily refer back
to it. גּאוה, pride, self-exaltation, used of the sea as in [Psa
89:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#010.md) גּאוּת, and in [Job
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011.md) גּאון are used. The futures in
[Psa 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md) do not continue the
infinitive construction: if the waters thereof roar, foam, etc.; but
they are, as their position and repetition indicate, intended to have a
concessive sense. And this favours the supposition of Hupfeld and Ewald
that the refrain, [Psa 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#008.md), 12, which
ought to form the apodosis of this concessive clause (cf. [Psa
139:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008.md); [Job
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md); [Isa
40:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#030)..md) has accidentally fallen out
here. In the text as it lies before us [Psa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md) attaches itself to לא־נירא: (we
do not fear), let its waters (i.e., the waters of the ocean) rage and
foam continually; and, inasmuch as the sea rises high, towering beyond
its shores, let the mountains threaten to topple in. The music, which
here becomes forte, strengthens the believing confidence of the
congregation, despite this wild excitement of the elements.

[Psalms 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 46:4</span></span>

(Heb.: 46:5-8) Just as, according to [Gen
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#010.md), a stream issued from Eden, to
water the whole garden, so a stream makes Jerusalem as it were into
another paradise: a river - whose streams make glad the city of Elohim
([Psa 87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md); [Psa
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#009.md), cf. [Psa
101:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#008).md); פּלגיו (used of the windings
and branches of the main-stream) is a second permutative subject ([Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003).md). What is intended is the river
of grace, which is also likened to a river of paradise in [Psa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md). When the city of God is
threatened and encompassed by foes, still she shall not hunger and
thirst, nor fear and despair; for the river of grace and of her
ordinances and promises flows with its rippling waves through the holy
place, where the dwelling-place or tabernacle of the Most High is
pitched. קדשׁ, Sanctum (cf. el-Ḳuds as a name of Jerusalem), as in [Psa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005.md), [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md); גּדל, [Exo
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016.md). משׁכּני, dwellings, like
משׁכּנות, [Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md); [Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md); [Psa
132:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#005.md), [Psa
132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007.md), equivalent to "a glorious
dwelling." In [Psa 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#006.md) in the place
of the river we find Him from whom the river issues forth. Elohim helps
her לפנותבּקר - there is only a night of trouble, the return of the
morning is also the sunrise of speedy help. The preterites in [Psa
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#007.md) are hypothetical: if peoples and
kingdoms become enraged with enmity and totter, so that the church is in
danger of being involved in this overthrow - all that God need to is to
make a rumbling with His almighty voice of thunder (נתן בּקולו, as in
[Psa 68:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#034.md); [Jer
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#008.md), cf. הרים בּמּטּה, to make a
lifting with the rod, [Exo 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020).md), and
forthwith the earth melts (muwg, as in [Amo
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005.md), Niph. [Isa
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031), and frequently.md), i.e., their
titanic defiance becomes cowardice, the bonds of their confederation
slacken, and the strength they have put forth is destroyed - it is
manifest that Jahve Tsebaoth is with His people. This name of God is, so
to speak, indigenous to the Korahitic Psalms, for it is the proper name
of God belonging to the time of the kings (vid., on [Psa
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#010.md); [Psa
59:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006).md), on the very verge of which it
occurs first of all in the mouth of Hannah ([Sa1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011).md), and the Korahitic Psalms have a
royal impress upon them. In the God, at whose summons all created powers
are obliged to marshal themselves like the hosts of war, Israel has a
steep stronghold, משׂגּב, which cannot be scaled by any foe - the army
of the confederate peoples and kingdoms, ere it has reached Jerusalem,
is become a field of the dead.

[Psalms 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 46:8</span></span>

(Heb.: 46:9-12) The mighty deeds of Jahve still lie visibly before them
in their results, and those who are without the pale of the church are
to see for themselves and be convinced. In a passage founded upon this,
[Psa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005.md), stands מפעלות אלהים; here,
according to Targum and Masora (vid., Psalter, ii. 472), מפעלות יהוה.

(Note: Nevertheless מפעלות אלהים is also found here as a various reading
that goes back to the time of the Talmud. The oldest Hebrew Psalter of
1477 reads thus, vide Repertorium fr Bibl. und Morgenlnd. Liter. v.
(1779), 148. Norzi decides in favour of it, and Biesenthal has also
adopted it in his edition of the Psalter (1837), which in other respects
is a reproduction of Heidenheim's text.)

Even an Elohimic Psalm gives to the God of Israel in opposition to all
the world no other name than יהוה. שׁמּות does not here signify stupenda
([Jer 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#021).md), but in accordance with
the phrase שׂוּם לשׁמּה, [Isa 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009.md),
and frequently: devastations, viz., among the enemies who have kept the
field against the city of God. The participle משׁבּית is designedly used
in carrying forward the description. The annihilation of the worldly
power which the church has just now experienced for its rescue, is a
prelude to the ceasing of all war, [Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003.md) ([Isa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004).md). Unto the ends of the earth will
Jahve make an end of waging war; and since He has no pleasure in war in
general, much less in war waged against His own people, all the
implements of war He in part breaks to pieces and in part consigns to
the flames (cf. [Isa 54:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#016)..md). Cease,
cries He ([Psa 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010).md) to the nations,
from making war upon my people, and know that I am God, the invincible
One, - invincible both in Myself and in My people, - who will be
acknowledged in My exaltation by all the world. A similar inferential
admonition closes [Psa 2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md). With
this admonition, which is both warning and threatening at the same time,
the nations are dismissed; but the church yet once more boasts that
Jahve Tsebaoth is its God and its stronghold.
