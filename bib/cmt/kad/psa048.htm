<p>The inaccessibleness of the City of God
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001">Psa 48:1-14</A> is also a song of thanksgiving for victory. It is connected with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001">Psa 46:1-11</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001">Psa 47:1-9</A> by the fundamental thought of the exaltation of Jahve above the peoples of the earth; but is distinguished from them both in this respect, viz., that, in accordance with the favourite characteristic of Korahitic poetry, the song of thanksgiving for victory has become a song in praise of Jerusalem, the glorious and strong city, protected by God who sits enthroned in it. The historical occasion is the same. The mention of the kings points to an army of confederates; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#010">Psa 48:10</A> points to the gathering held in the temple before the setting out of the army; and the figurative representation of the hostile powers by the shattered ships of Tarshish does not apply to any period so well as to the time of Jehoshaphat. The points of coincidence between this Psalm (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007">Psa 48:7</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014">Isa 33:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008">Psa 48:8</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021">Isa 33:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#013">Psa 48:13</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018">Isa 33:18</A>; v. 15 with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022">Isa 33:22</A>), as well as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001">Psa 46:1-11</A>, and Isaiah do not prove that he is its author. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001">Psalms 48:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 48:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>(Heb.: 48:2-9) Viewed as to the nature of its subject-matter, the Psalm divides itself into three parts. We begin by considering the three strophes of the first part. The middle strophe presents an instance of the rising and falling caesural schema. Because Jahve has most marvellously delivered Jerusalem, the poet begins with the praise of the great King and of His Holy City. Great and praised according to His due (&#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004">Psa 18:4</A>) is He in her, is He upon His holy mountain, which there is His habitation. Next follow, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003">Psa 48:3</A>, two predicates of a threefold, or fundamentally only twofold, subject; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;, in whatever way it may be understood, is in apposition to &#1492;&#1512;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;. The predicates consequently refer to Zion-Jerusalem; for &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1512;&#1489; is not a name for Zion, but, inasmuch as the transition is from the holy mountain to the Holy City (just as the reverse is the case in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002">Psa 48:2</A>), Jerusalem; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#035">Mat 5:35</A>. Of Zion-Jerusalem it is therefore said, it is &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1504;&#1493;&#1507;, beautiful in prominence or elevation (&#1504;&#1493;&#1507; from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, Arabic na&#770;fa, nauf, root &#1504;&#1507;, the stronger force of &#1504;&#1489;, Arab. nb, to raise one's self, to mount, to come sensibly forward; just as &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; also goes back to a root &#1497;&#1507;, Arab. yf, wf, which signifies "to rise, to be high," and is transferred in the Hebrew to eminence, perfection, beauty of form), a beautifully rising terrace-like height; 
<p>(Note: Luther with Jerome (departing from the lxx and Vulgate) renders it: "Mount Zion is like a beautiful branch," after the Mishna-Talmudic &#1504;&#1493;&#1507;, a branch, Maccoth 12a, which is compared also by Saadia and Dunash. The latter renders it "beautiful in branches," and refers it to the Mount of Olives.) 
<p>and, in the second place, it is the joy (&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1513;&#1474;) of the whole earth. It is deserving of being such, as the people who dwell there are themselves convinced (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015">Lam 2:15</A>); and it is appointed to become such, it is indeed such even now in hope, - hope which is, as it were, being anticipatorily verified. but in what sense does the appositional &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; follow immediately upon &#1492;&#1512;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;? Hitzig, Ewald, Hengstenberg, Caspari (Micha, p. 359), and others, are of opinion that the hill of Zion is called the extreme north with reference to the old Asiatic conception of the mountain of the gods - old Persic Ar-bur'g (Al-bur'g), and also called absolutely hara or haraiti, 
<p>(Note: Vid., Spiegel, Era&#770;n, S. 287f.) 
<p>old Indian Kaila&#770;sa and Me&#770;ru 
<p>(Note: Vide Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, ii. 847.)
<p> - forming the connecting link between heaven and earth, which lay in the inaccessible, holy distance and concealment of the extreme north. But the poet in no way betrays the idea that he applies this designation to Zion in an ideal sense only, as being not inferior to the extreme north (Bertheau, Lage des Paradieses, S. 50, and so also S. D. Luzzatto on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013">Isa 14:13</A>), or as having taken the place of it (Hitzig). That notion is found, it is true, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013">Isa 14:13</A>, in the mouth of the king of the Chaldeans; but, with the exception of the passage before us, we have no trace of the Israelitish mind having blended this foreign mythological style of speech with its own. We therefore take the expression "sides of the north" to be a topographical designation, and intended literally. Mount Zion is thereby more definitely designated as the Temple-hill; for the Temple-hill, or Zion in the narrower sense, formed in reality the north-eastern angle or corner of ancient Jerusalem. It is not necessarily the extreme north (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#006">Eze 38:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#002">Eze 39:2</A>), which is called &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; are the two sides, then the angle in which the two side lines meet, and just such a northern angle was Mount Moriah by its position in relation to the city of David and the lower city.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003">Psa 48:3</A>
<p>(Heb.: 48:4) <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003">Psa 48:3</A>, where the pointing is rightly &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, not &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, shows that the praise sung by the poet is based upon an event in contemporary history. Elohim has made Himself known by the loftily built parts 
<p>(Note: lxx: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, on which Gregory of Nyssa remarks (Opera, Ed. Paris, t. i. p. 333): &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;.)
<p>of Jerusalem (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#007">Psa 122:7</A>) &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; (the &#1500; that is customary with verbs of becoming and making), i.e., as an inaccessible fortress, making them secure against any hostile attack. The fact by which He has thus made Himself known now immediately follows. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; points to a definite number of kings known to the poet; it therefore speaks in favour of the time of peril and war in the reign of Jehoshaphat and against that in the reign of Hezekiah. &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; is reciprocal: to appoint themselves a place of meeting, and meet together there. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029">Jdg 11:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#021">Kg2 8:21</A>, of crossing the frontier and invasion (Hitzig), not of perishing and destruction, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036">Psa 37:36</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012">Nah 1:12</A> (De Wette); for &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493; requires further progress, and the declaration respecting their sudden downfall does not follow till later on. The allies encamped in the desert to Tekoa, about three hours distant from Jerusalem. The extensive view at that point extends even to Jerusalem: as soon as they saw it they were amazed, i.e., the seeing and astonishment, panic and confused flight, occurred all together; there went forth upon them from the Holy City, because Elohim dwells therein, a &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015">Sa1 14:15</A>), or as we should say, a panic or a panic-striking terror. Concerning &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; as expressive of simultaneousness, vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010">Hab 3:10</A>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in the correlative protasis is omitted, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002">Hos 11:2</A>, and frequently; cf. on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009">Isa 55:9</A>. Trembling seized upon them there (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005">Psa 14:5</A>), pangs as of a woman in travail. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008">Psa 48:8</A>, the description passes over emotionally into the form of address. It moulds itself according to the remembrance of a recent event of the poet's own time, viz., the destruction of the merchant fleet fitted out by Jehoshaphat in conjunction with Ahaziah, king of Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049">Kg1 22:49</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#036">Ch2 20:36</A>.). The general meaning of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008">Psa 48:8</A> is, that God's omnipotence is irresistible. Concerning the "wind of the east quarter," which here, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#026">Eze 27:26</A>, causes shipwreck, vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021">Job 27:21</A>. The "ships of Tarshish," as is clear from the context both before and after, are not meant literally, but used as a figure of the worldly powers; Isaiah (Isa 33) also compares Assyria to a gallant ship. Thus, then, the church can say that in the case of Jerusalem it has, as an eye-witness, experienced that which it has hitherto only heard from the tradition of a past age (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005">Job 42:5</A>), viz., that God holds it erect, establishes it, for ever. Hengstenberg observes here, "The Jerusalem that has been laid in ruins is not that which the psalmist means; it is only its outward form which it has put off" [lit. its broken and deserted pupa]. It is true that, according to its inner and spiritual nature, Jerusalem continues its existence in the New Testament church; but it is not less true that its being trodden under foot for a season in the kairoi' ethnoo'n no more annuls the promise of God than Israel's temporary rejection annuls Israel's election. The Holy City does not fall without again rising up. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#009">Psalms 48:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 48:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>(Heb.: 48:10-12) Now follows grateful praise to God, who hears prayer and executes justice, to the joy of His city and of His people. By &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; the poet refers back to the service held in the temple before the army set out, as narrated in 2 Chr. 20, to the prayers offered in the time of their impending danger, and to the remembrance of the favour hitherto shown towards Jerusalem, from which source they drew the comfort of hope for the present time. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, to compare, to hold one thing over against another, in this instance by causing the history of the past to pass before one's mind. To God's mighty deeds of old is now added a new one. The Name of God, i.e., the sum of His self-attestations hitherto, was the subject of the &#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; in the temple, and more particularly of the Korahitic songs (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#019">Ch2 20:19</A>); and this name has gloriously verified itself by a new deed of righteousness. His fame extends even to the ends of the earth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#029">Ch2 20:29</A>). He has proved Himself to be One whose right hand is full of righteousness, and who practises righteousness or justice where it is necessary. Let, then, the Holy City, let the country cities of Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009">Isa 40:9</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002">Psa 16:2</A>) rejoice. The whole inheritance of Israel was threatened. Now it is most gloriously delivered.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 48:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>(Heb.: 48:13-15) The call is addressed not to the enemies of Jerusalem - for it would be absurd to invite such to look round about upon Jerusalem with joy and gladness - but to the people of Jerusalem itself. From the time of the going forth of the army to the arrival of the news of victory, they have remained behind the walls of the city in anxious expectation. Now they are to make the circuit of the city (&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507;, still more definite than &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#003">Jos 6:3</A>) outside the walls, and examine them and see that its towers are all standing, its bulwark is intact, its palaces are resplendent as formerly. &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, "upon its bulwark," = &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#004">Zac 9:4</A>), with softened suffix as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017">Isa 23:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006">Psa 45:6</A>, and frequently; Ew. 247, d. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1490; (according to another reading, &#1492;&#1508;&#1505;&#1497;&#1490;) signifies, in B. Baba kamma 81b, to cut through (a vineyard in a part where there is no way leading through it); the signification "to take to pieces and examine, to contemplate piece by piece," has no support in the usage of the language, and the signification "to extol" (erhhen, Luther following Jewish tradition) rests upon a false deduction from the name &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;. Louis de Dieu correctly renders it: Dividite palatia, h. e. obambulate inter palatia ejus, secando omnes palatiorum vias, quo omnia possitis commode intueri. They are to convince themselves by all possible means of the uninjured state of the Holy City, in order that they may be able to tell to posterity, that &#1494;&#1492;, such an one, such a marvellous helper as is now manifest to them, is Elohim our God. He will also in the future guide us.... Here the Psalm closes; for, although &#1504;&#1492;&#1490; is wont to be construed with &#1506;&#1500;&#1468; in the signification &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002">Psa 23:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010">Isa 49:10</A>), still "at death" [lit. dying], i.e., when it comes to dying (Hengstenberg), or "even unto (&#1506;&#1500; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011">Psa 48:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007">Psa 19:7</A>) death" [lit. dying] (Hupfeld), forms no suitable close to this thoroughly national song, having reference to a people of whom the son of Sirach says (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025">Psa 37:25</A>): &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;. The rendering of Mendelssohn, Stier, and others, "over death" i.e., beyond death (Syriac), would be better; more accurately: beyond dying = destruction (Bunsen, Bibelwerk, Th. i. S. clxi.). but the expression does not admit of this extension, and the thought comes upon one unexpectedly and as a surprise in this Psalm belonging to the time before the Exile. The Jerusalem Talmud, Megilla, ch. ii. (fol. 73, col. b, ed. Venet.), present a choice of the following interpretations: (1) &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; = &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, in youthfulness, adopting which, but somewhat differently applied, the Targum renders, "in the days of youth;" (2) &#1499;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, like virgins, with which Luther's rendering coincides: like youth (wie die Jugent); (3) according to the reading &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, which the lxx also reproduces: in this and the future world, noting at the same time that Akilas (Aquila) translates the word by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;: "in a world where there is no death." But in connection with this last rendering one would rather expect to find &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028">Pro 12:28</A>) instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;. &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, however, as equivalent to &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; is Mishnic, not Biblical; and a Hebrew word &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;) in the sense of the Aramaic &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468; cannot be justified elsewhere. We see from the wavering of the MSS, some of which give &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, and others &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, and from the wavering of expositors, what little success is likely to follow any attempt to gain for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, as a substantial part of the Psalm, any sense that is secure and in accordance both with the genius of the language and with the context. Probably it is a marginal note of the melody, an abbreviation for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001">Psa 9:1</A>. And either this note, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019">Hab 3:19</A> &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, stands in an exceptional manner at the end instead of the beginning (Hitzig, Reggio), or it belongs to the &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495; of the following Psalm, and is to be inserted there (Bttcher, De inferis, 371). If, however, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; does not belong to the Psalm itself, then it must be assumed that the proper closing words are lost. The original close was probably more full-toned, and somewhat like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022">Isa 33:22</A>.
