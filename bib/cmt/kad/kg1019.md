[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 19:1</span></span>

The hope of completing his victory over the idolaters and overthrowing
the worship of Baal, even in the capital of the kingdom, with which
Elijah may have hastened to Jezreel, was frustrated by the malice of the
queen, who was so far from discerning any revelation of the almighty God
in the account given her by Ahab of what had occurred on Carmel, and
bending before His mighty hand, that, on the contrary, she was so full
of wrath at the slaying of the prophets of Baal as to send to the
prophet Elijah to threaten him with death. This apparent failure of his
ministry was the occasion of a severe inward conflict, in which Elijah
was brought to a state of despondency and fled from the land. The Lord
allowed His servant to pass through this conflict, that he might not
exalt himself, but, being mindful of his own impotence, might rest
content with the grace of his God, whose strength is mighty in the weak
([Co2 12:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008).md), and who would refine
and strengthen him for the further fulfilment of his calling.

[Kg1 19:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#001.md)

Elijah's flight into the desert and guidance to Horeb. - [Kg1
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#001.md), [Kg1
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#002.md). When "Ahab told Jezebel all that
Elijah had done, and all, how he had slain all the prophets (of Baal),"
she sent a messenger to Elijah in her impotent wrath, with a threat,
which she confirmed by an oath (see at [Kg1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#023).md), that in the morning she would
have him slain like the prophets whom he had put to death. The early
commentators detected in this threat the impotentia muliebris
iracundiae, and saw that all that Jezebel wanted was to get rid of the
man who was so distressing and dangerous to her, because she felt
herself unable to put him to death, partly on account of the people, who
were enthusiastic in his favour, and partly on account of the king
himself, upon whom the affair at Carmel had not remained without its
salutary effect.

[Kg1 19:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#003.md)

But when Elijah saw (ויּרא), sc. how things stood, or the audacity of
Jezebel, from which the failure of his work was evident, he rose up and
went to Beersheba in Judah, i.e., Bir-seba on the southern frontier of
Canaan (see at [Gen 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031).md). The
expression ליהוּדה אשׁר, "which to Judah," i.e., which belonged to the
kingdom of Judah, for Beersheba was really allotted to the tribe of
Simeon ([Jos 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002).md), is appended not
merely as a geographical indication that Elijah went outside the land,
but to show that he meant to leave the kingdom of Israel, the scene of
his previous labours, just as Jeremiah in a similar internal conflict
gave utterance to the wish that he could leave his people, if he had but
a lodging-place in the wilderness ([Jer
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002).md). ויּרא is not to be altered into
ויּירא, et timuit, after the lxx and Vulg., notwithstanding the fact
that some Codd. have this reading, which only rests upon an erroneous
conjecture. For it is obvious that Elijah did not flee from any fear of
the vain threat of Jezebel, from the fact that he did not merely
withdrawn into the kingdom of Judah, where he would have been safe under
Jehoshaphat from all the persecutions of Jezebel, but went to Beersheba,
and thence onwards into the desert there to pour out before the Lord God
his weariness of life ([Kg1 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004).md).

ילך אל־נפשׁו, he went upon his soul, or his life, i.e., not to save his
life (as I once thought, with many other commentators), for his wish to
die ([Kg1 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004).md) is opposed to this;
but to care for his soul in the manner indicated in [Kg1
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md), i.e., to commit his soul or his
life to the Lord his God in the solitude of the desert, and see what He
would determine concerning him.

(Note: G. Menken (christl. Homil. b. den Proph. Elias, p. 231) has given
the following admirable explanation of אל נפשו fo so far as the sense is
concerned: "For conscience sake, from conviction, out of obligation, not
from fear. After all his former experience, and from the entire relation
in which Elijah stood to God, it was impossible that he should be
afraid, and not be firmly convinced that the God who had shut up heaven
at his word, who had supplied him with bread and flesh for a whole year
in the desert through the medium of ravens, who had supported him
miraculously for years in a foreign land through the medium of a poor
widow, who had concealed and rescued him for three years and a half from
the search of the king, who had accredited and honoured him in the sight
of all the people as His servant, who had given an immediate answer to
his prayer for rain, could also defend him in this extremity, and rescue
him from this danger, if such should be His will.")

\- He left his servant in Beersheba, while he himself went a day's
journey farther into the desert (Paran), not merely because he was so
filled with weariness of life in his dark oppression, that he thought he
should have no further need of his servant, and therefore left him
behind in Beersheba, but that he might pour out his heart before God
alone in the desert and yield himself up to His guidance. For however
unquestionably his lamentation in [Kg1
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md), for example, expresses a
weariness of life, this merely indicates the feeling which had taken
possession of his soul after a day's journey in the barren desert. And
even there he lays his wish to die before God in prayer; so that this
feeling is merely to be regarded as one result of the spiritual
conflict, which is bodily exhaustion had now raised to a height that it
cannot have reached when he was in Beersheba. If, therefore, he did not
start with the intention of making a pilgrimage to Horeb, he had
certainly gone into the desert for the purpose of seeing whether the
Lord would manifest His mercy to him, as He had formerly done to His
people under Moses, or whether He would withdraw His hand entirely from
him. After a day's journey he sat down under a רתם (construed here as a
feminine, in [Kg1 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#005.md) as a
masculine), a species of broom (genista Retem in Forskl), which is the
finest and most striking shrub of the Arabian desert, growing constantly
in the beds of streams and in the valleys, where places of encampment
are frequently selected for the sake of the shelter which they afford by
night from the wind and by day from the sun (Rob. Pal. i. 299).
למוּת...ויּשׁאל: and wished that his soul might die (a kind of
accusative with infinitive; see Ewald, 336, b.), and said, עתּה רב,
"Enough now; take, Lord, my soul, for I am not better than my fathers;"
i.e., I have worked and endured enough, and deserve no longer life than
my fathers. From this it appears that Elijah was already of a great age.

[Kg1 19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#005.md)

In this disturbed state of mind he lay down and slept under a
broom-tree. Then the Lord came with His power to the help of the
despairing man. "An angel touched him (wakened him out of his sleep),
and said to him: Arise, eat." And behold he saw at his head עגּת רצפים,
a bread cake baked over red-hot stones, a savoury article of food which
is still a great favourite with the Bedouins (see at [Gen
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#006.md); [Gen
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003).md), and a pitcher of water, and ate
and drank, and lay down again.

[Kg1 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#007.md)

But the angel wakened him a second time, and called upon him to eat with
these words: "for the way is too far for thee" (רב ממּך הדּרך, iter est
majus quam pro viribus tuis - Vat.).

[Kg1 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#008.md)

"Then he arose, ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food
forty days and forty nights to the mount of God at Horeb." As the angel
did not tell him whither he was to go, and Elijah wandered to Horeb in
consequence of this strengthening, it appears to have been his intention
from the very beginning to go into the desert, and see whether the Lord
would still further acknowledge him and his work; so that in the support
and strength imparted by the angel he saw an indication that he was to
follow the footsteps of the divine grace still farther into the desert,
and make a pilgrimage to Horeb, with the hope that there perhaps the
Lord would reveal to him His counsel concerning the further guidance of
the people of His covenant, as He had formerly done to His servant
Moses, and give him the necessary instruction for the continuance of his
prophetic service. Horeb is called the mount of God here, as it was
proleptically in [Exo 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md), as the
place where the Lord confirmed the covenant, already made with the
patriarchs, to their descendants, and adopted the tribes of Israel as
His people and made them into a kingdom of God. The distance from
Beersheba to Horeb is about 200 miles. Consequently Elijah would not
have required forty days to travel there, if the intention of God had
been nothing more than to cause him to reach the mountain, or "to help
him on his say" (Thenius). But in the strength of the food provided by
the angel Elijah was not only to perform the journey to Horeb, but to
wander in the desert for forty days and forty nights, i.e., forty whole
days, as Moses had formerly wandered with all Israel for forty years;
that he might know that the Lord was still the same God who had
nourished and sustained His whole nation in the desert with manna from
heaven for forty years. And just as the forty years' sojourn in the
desert had been to Moses a time for the trial of faith and for exercise
in humility and meekness ([Num 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003).md),
so was the strength of Elijah's faith to be tried by the forty days'
wandering in the same desert, and to be purified from all carnal zeal
for the further fulfilment of His calling, in accordance with the divine
will. What follows shows very clearly that this was the object of the
divine guidance of Elijah (cf. Hengstenberg, Diss. on the Pentateuch,
vol. i. 171,172).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 19:9</span></span>

Appearance of God at Horeb. - [Kg1
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#009.md). When Elijah arrived at Horeb, he
went into the cave (the definite article in המּערה, with the obvious
connection between the appearance of God, which follows here, and that
described in [Exo 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012.md)., points back
to the cleft in the rock, נקרת הצּוּר) in which Moses had stood while
the glory of Jehovah passed by (see at [Exo
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022).md), and there he passed the night.
And behold the word of the Lord came to him (in the night): "What doest
thou here, Elijah?" This question did not involve a reproof, as though
Elijah had nothing to do there, but was simply intended to lead him to
give utterance to the thoughts and feelings of his heart.

[Kg1 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010.md)

Elijah answered: "I have striven zealously for Jehovah the God of hosts,
for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, destroyed Thine
altars, and killed Thy prophets with the sword; and I only am left, and
they seek my life." In these words there was not only the greatest
despair expressed as to the existing condition of things, but also a
carnal zeal which would gladly have called down the immediate vengeance
of the Almighty upon all idolaters. The complaint contained, on the one
hand, the tacit reproof that God had looked on quietly for so long a
time at the conduct of the ungodly, and had suffered things to come to
such an extremity, that he, His prophet, was the only one left of all
the true worshippers of God, and, on the other hand, the indirect appeal
that He would interpose at last with His penal judgments. Because Elijah
had not seen the expected salutary fruits of his zeal for the Lord, he
thought that all was lost, and in his gloomy state of mind overlooked
what he had seen a short time before with his own eyes, that even in the
neighbourhood of the king himself there lived a pious and faithful
worshipper of Jehovah, viz., Obadiah, who had concealed a hundred
prophets from the revenge of Jezebel, and that the whole of the people
assembled upon Carmel had given glory to the Lord, and at his command
had seized the prophets of Baal and put them to death, and therefore
that the true worshippers of the Lord could not all have vanished out of
Israel. קנּא קנּאתי ליהוה recalls to mind the zeal of Phinehas ([Num
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011)..md), which put an end to the
whoredom of the sons of Israel with the daughters of Moab. But whereas
Phinehas received the promise of an everlasting priesthood for his zeal,
Elijah had seen so little fruit from his zeal against the worshippers of
Baal, that they actually sought his life. מזבּחתך are altars, which
pious Israelites in the kingdom of the ten tribes had built in different
places for the worship of Jehovah (see at [Kg1
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#030).md).

[Kg1 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011.md)

The Lord replied to the prophet's complaint first of all by the
manifestation of His control of the phenomena of nature ([Kg1
19:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011).md), and then by a verbal
explanation of His design ([Kg1
19:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#015).md).

In this divine revelation men have recognised from the very earliest
times a repetition of the appearance of God which was granted to Moses
upon Sinai. As God, in token of His grace, granted the prayer of Moses
that he might see His glory, after he had striven zealously for the
honour of the Lord when the people rebelled by worshipping the golden
calf; so did He also display His glory upon Horeb to Elijah as a second
Moses for the purpose of strengthening his faith, with this simple
difference, that He made all His goodness pass by Moses, and declared
His name in the words, "Jehovah, a gracious and merciful God," etc.
([Exo 34:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006).md), whereas He caused
Elijah first of all to behold the operation of His grace in certain
phenomena of nature, and then afterwards made known to him His will with
regard to Israel and to the work of His prophets. This difference in the
form of the revelation, while the substance and design were essentially
the same, may be explained from the difference not only in the
historical circumstances, but also in the state of mind of the two
servants to whom He manifested His glory. In the case of Moses it was
burning love for the welfare of his people which impelled him to offer
the prayer that the Lord would let him see His glory, as a sign that He
would not forsake His people; and this prayer was granted him, so far as
a man is ever able to see the glory of God, to strengthen him for the
further discharge of the duties of his office. Hidden in the cleft of
the rock and shielded by the hand of God, he saw the Lord pass by him,
and heard Him utter in words His inmost being. Elijah, on the other
hand, in his zeal for the honour of God, which was not quite free from
human passion, had been led by the want of any visible fruit from his
own labour to overlook the work of the Lord in the midst of His people;
so that he had fled into the desert and wished to be released from this
world by death, and had not been brought out of his despair by the
strengthening with meat and drink which he had received from the angel,
and which enabled him to travel for forty days to the mount of God
without suffering from want, a fact which was intended to remind him of
the ancient God of the fathers, to whose omnipotence and goodness there
is no end; so that it was in a most gloomy state of mind that he reached
Horeb at last. And now the Lord designed not only to manifest His glory
as the love in which grace and righteousness are united, but also to
show him that his zeal for the honour of the Lord was not in harmony
with the love and grace and long-suffering of God. "The design of the
vision was to show to the fiery zeal of the prophet, who wanted to
reform everything by means of the tempest, the gentle way which God
pursues, and to proclaim the long-suffering and mildness of His nature,
as the voice had already done to Moses on that very spot; hence the
beautiful change in the divine appearance" (Herder, Geist der hebr.
Poesie, 1788, ii. p. 52).

[Kg1 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#012.md)

After God had commanded him to come out of the cave and stand upon the
mountain (that part of the mountain which was in front of the cave)
before Him, "behold Jehovah went by (the participle עבר is used to give
a more vivid representation of the scene); and a great and strong
tempest, rending mountains and breaking rocks in pieces, before Jehovah
- it was not in the tempest that Jehovah was; and after the tempest an
earthquake - it was not in the earthquake that Jehovah was; and after
the earthquake fire - it was not in the fire that Jehovah was; and after
the fire a still, gentle rustling." דקּה דּממה קול, literally the tone
of a gentle blowing. On the change of gender in וחזק גּדולה רוּח, see
Ewald, 174, e. - Tempest, earthquake, and fire, which are even more
terrible in the awful solitude of the Horeb mountains than in an
inhabited land, are signs of the coming of the Lord to judgment (cf.
[Psa 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008)..md). It was in the midst of
such terrible phenomena that the Lord had once come down upon Sinai, to
inspire the people who were assembled at the foot of the mountain with a
salutary dread of His terrible majesty, of the fiery zeal of His wrath
and love, which consumes whatever opposes it (see at [Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016)..md). but now the lord was not in
these terrible phenomena; to signify to the prophet that He did not work
in His earthly kingdom with the destroying zeal of wrath, or with the
pitiless severity of judgment. It was in a soft, gentle rustling that He
revealed Himself to him.

[Kg1 19:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#013.md)

When Elijah heard this, he covered up his face in his cloak (אדּרת; see
at [Kg2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008).md) and went out to the
entrance to the cave. And behold he heard the question a second time,
"What doest thou here, Elijah?" and answered with a repetition of his
complain (see [Kg1 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#009.md), [Kg1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010).md). - While the appearance of God,
not in the tempest, the earthquake, and the fire, but in a gentle
rustling, revealed the Lord to him as a merciful and gracious God,
long-suffering, and of great goodness and truth ([Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006).md), the answer to his complaint
showed him that He did not leave guilt unpunished ([Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007).md), since the Lord gave him the
following command, [Kg1 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#015.md).: "Go
back in thy way to the desert of Damascus, and anoint Hazael king over
Aram (see [Kg2 8:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012).md), and Jehu the
son of Nimshi king over Israel (see [Kg2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#002).md), and Elisha the son of Shaphat
prophet in thy stead" (see [Kg1
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019).md); and then added this promise,
which must have quieted his zeal, that was praiseworthy in the feelings
from which it sprang, although it had assumed too passionate a form, and
have given him courage to continue his prophetic work: "And it will come
to pass, that however escapeth the sword of Hazael, him will Jehu slay,
and whoever escapeth the sword of Jehu, him will Elisha slay."

[Kg1 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018.md)

But in order that he might learn, to his shame, that the cause of the
Lord in Israel appeared much more desperate to his eye, which was
clouded by his own dissatisfaction, than it really was in the eye of the
God who knows His own by number and by name, the Lord added: "I have
seven thousand left in Israel, all knees that have not bent before Baal,
and every mouth that hath not kissed him." מדבּרה המּשׂק, into the
desert of Damascus (with the He loc. with the construct state as in [Deu
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041.md); [Jos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001), etc.; cf. Ewald, 216, b..md), i.e.,
the desert lying to the south and east of the city of Damascus, which is
situated on the river Barady; not per desertum in Damascum (Vulg.,
Luth., etc.); for although Elijah would necessarily pass through the
Arabian desert to go from Horeb to Damascus, it was superfluous to tell
him that he was to go that way, as there was no other road. The words
"return by thy way ... and anoint Hazael," etc., are not to be
understood as signifying that Elijah was to go at once to Damascus and
anoint Hazael there, but simply that he was to do this at a time which
the Spirit would more precisely indicate. According to what follows, all
that Elijah accomplished immediately was to call Elisha to be his
successor; whereas the other two commissions were fulfilled by Elisha
after Elijah's ascension to heaven (2 Kings 8 and 9). The opinion that
Elijah also anointed Hazael and Jehu immediately, but that this
anointing was kept secret, and was repeated by Elisha when the time for
their public appearance arrived, has not only very little probability in
itself, but is directly precluded by the account of the anointing of
Jehu in 2 Kings 9. The anointing of Hazael and Jehu is mentioned first,
because God had chosen these two kings to be the chief instruments of
His judgments upon the royal family and people for their idolatry. It
was only in the case of Jehu that a real anointing took place ([Kg2
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#006).md); Hazael was merely told by Elisha
that he would be king ([Kg2 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#013).md), and
Elisha was simply called by Elijah to the prophetic office by having the
cloak of the latter thrown upon him. Moreover, the Messianic passage,
[Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md), is the only one in which
there is any allusion to the anointing of a prophet. Consequently משׁח
must be taken figuratively here as in [Jdg
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008.md), as denoting divine consecration
to the regal and prophetic offices. And so, again, the statement that
Elisha would slay those who escaped the sword of Jehu is not to be
understood literally. Elisha slew by the word of the Lord, which brought
judgments upon the ungodly, as we see from [Kg2
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#024.md) (cf. [Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md); [Jer
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007).md). The "seven thousand," who had
not bowed the knee before Baal, are a round number for the ἐκλογν́ of the
godly, whom the Lord had preserved for Himself in the sinful kingdom,
which was really very large in itself, however small it might be in
comparison with the whole nation. The number seven is the stamp of the
works of God, so that seven thousand is the number of the "remnant
according to the election of grace" ([Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005).md), which had then been preserved
by God. Kissing Baal was the most usual form in which this idol was
worshipped, and consisted not merely in throwing kisses with the hand
(cf. [Job 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#027.md), and Plin. h. n. 28,
8), but also in kissing the images of Baal, probably on the feet (cf.
Cicero in Verr. 4, 43).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 19:19</span></span>

Call of Elisha to be a prophet. - [Kg1
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019.md). As he went thence (viz., away
from Horeb), Elijah found Elisha the son of Shaphat at Abel-Meholah, in
the Jordan valley (see at [Jdg 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022).md),
occupied in ploughing; "twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he himself
with the twelfth" (a very wealthy man therefore), and threw his cloak to
him as he passed by. The prophet's cloak was sign of the prophet's
vocation so that throwing it to him was a symbol of the call to the
prophetic office.

[Kg1 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#020.md)

Elisha understanding the sign, left the oxen standing, ran after Elijah,
and said to him, "Let me kiss my father and my mother," i.e., take leave
of my parents, and when I will follow thee. For the form אשׁקה see
Ewald, 228, b. As he has ploughed his earthly field with his twelve pair
of oxen, he was not to plough the spiritual field of the twelve tribes
of Israel ([Luk 9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062).md). Elijah
answered, "Go, return, for what have I done to thee?" שׁוּב לך belong
together, as in [Kg1 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#015.md); so that
Elijah thereby gave him permission to return to his father and mother.
כּי signifies for, not yet (Thenius); for there is no antithesis here,
according to which כּי might serve for a more emphatic assurance (Ewald,
330, b.). The words "what have I done to thee?" can only mean, I have
not wanted to put any constraint upon thee, but leave it to thy free
will to decide in favour of the prophetic calling.

[Kg1 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#021.md)

Then Elisha returned, took the pair of oxen with which he had been
ploughing, sacrificed, i.e., slaughtered them (זבח used figuratively),
boiled the flesh with the plough, gave a farewell meal to the people (of
his place of abode), i.e., his friends and acquaintance, and then
followed Elijah as his servant, i.e., his assistant. The suffix in
בּשּׁלם refers to הבּקר צמּד, and is more precisely defined by the
apposition הבּשׂר, "namely, the flesh of the oxen."
