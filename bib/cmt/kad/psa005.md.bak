### [Psalms Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 5:0</span></span>

(In the Hebrew, v.1 is the designation 'To the leader:....A Psalm of
David'; from then on v.1-12 in English translation corresponds to v.2-13
in the Hebrew)

Morning Prayer before Going to the House of God

The evening prayer is now followed by a second morning prayer, which
like the former draws to a close with כּי־אתּה ([Psa
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008.md); [Psa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012).md). The situation is different from
that in [Psa 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md). In that Psalm
David is fleeing, here he is in Jerusalem and anticipates going up to
the Temple service. If this Psalm also belongs to the time of the
rebellion of Absolom, it must have been written when the fire which
afterwards broke forth was already smouldering in secret.

The inscription אל־הנּחילות is certainly not a motto indicative of its
contents (lxx, Vulg., Luther, Hengstenberg). As such it would stand
after מזמור. Whatever is connected with למנצח, always has reference to
the music. If נחילות came from נחל it might according to the biblical
use of this verb signify "inheritances," or according to its use in the
Talmud "swarms," and in fact swarms of bees (Arab. naḥl); and נחילות
ought then to be the beginning of a popular melody to which the Psalm is
adapted. Hai Gaon understands it to denote a melody resembling the hum
of bees; Reggio a song that sings of bees. Or is נחילות equivalent to
נחלּות (excavatae) and this a special name for the flutes (חלילים)? The
use of the flute in the service of the sanctuary is attested by [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md), cf. [Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005.md); [Kg1
1:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#040.md).

(Note: On the use of the flute in the second Temple, vid., Introduction
p. 19.)

The praep. אל was, then, more appropriate than על; because, as Redslob
has observed, the singer cannot play the flute at the same time, but can
only sing to the playing of another.

The Psalm consists of four six line strophes. The lines of the strophes
here and there approximate to the caesura-schema. They consist of a
rising and a sudden lowering. The German language, which uses so many
more words, is not adapted to this caesura-schema \[and the same may be
said of the English\].

[Psalms 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 5:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 5:2-4) The introit: Prayer to be heard. The thoughts are simple
but the language is carefully chosen. אמרים is the plur. of אמר (אמר),
one of the words peculiar to the poetic prophetical style. The
denominative האזין (like audire = aus, οὖς dare) belongs more to poetry
than prose. הגיג (like אביב) or מחיר (like מחיר) occurs only in two
Psalms לדוד, viz., here and [Psa 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#004.md).
It is derived from הגג = הגה (vid., [Psa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002).md) and signifies that which is
spoken meditatively, here praying in rapt devotion. Beginning thus the
prayer gradually rises to a vox clamoris. שׁועי from שׁוע, to be
distinguished from שׁוּעי (inf. Pi.) [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md); [Psa
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md), is one word with the Aram. צוח,
Aethiop. צוּע (to call). On הקשׁיב used of intent listening, vid., [Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md). The invocation מלכּי ואלהי,
when it is a king who utters it, is all the more significant. David, and
in general the theocratic king, is only the representative of the
Invisible One, whom he with all Israel adores as his King. Prayer to Him
is his first work as he begins the day. In the morning, בּקר (as in [Psa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008.md) for בּבּקר, [Psa
88:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#013).md), shalt Thou hear my cry, is
equivalent to my cry which goes forth with the early morn. Hupfeld
considers the mention of the morning as only a "poetical expression" and
when getting rid of the meaning prima luce, he also gets rid of the
beautiful and obvious reference to the daily sacrifice. The verb ערך is
the word used of laying the wood in order for the sacrifice, [Lev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#007.md), and the pieces of the sacrifice,
[Lev 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#008.md), [Lev
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#012.md); [Lev
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#005.md), of putting the sacred lamps in
order, [Exo 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021.md); [Lev
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#003.md)., and of setting the shew-bread
in order, [Exo 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#023.md); [Lev
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#008.md). The laying of the wood in order
for the morning offering of a lamb ([Lev
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#005.md) \[[Lev
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#012.md)\], cf. [Num
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#004).md) was one of the first duties of
the priest, as soon as the day began to dawn; the lamb was slain before
sun-rise and when the sun appeared above the horizon laid piece by piece
upon the altar. The morning prayer is compared to this morning
sacrifice. This is in its way also a sacrifice. The object which David
has in his mind in connection with אערך is תּפלּתי. As the priests, with
the early morning, lay the wood and pieces of the sacrifices of the
Tamı̂d upon the altar, so he brings his prayer before God as a spiritual
sacrifice and looks out for an answer (צפּה speculari as in [Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001).md), perhaps as the priest looks out
for fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice, or looks to the smoke to
see that it rises up straight towards heaven.

[Psalms 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 5:4</span></span>

(Heb.: 5:5-7) The basing of the prayer on God's holiness. The verbal
adjective חפץ (coming from the primitive signification of adhering
firmly which is still preserved in Arab. chfd, fut. i.) is in the sing.
always ([Psa 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013.md); [Psa
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027).md) joined with the accusative. רע
is conceived as a person, for although גּוּר may have a material object,
it cannot well have a material subject. יגרך is used for brevity of
expression instead of יגוּר עמּך (Ges. 121, 4). The verb גּוּר (to turn
in, to take up one's abode with or near any one) frequently has an
accusative object, [Psa 120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005.md), [Jdg
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#017.md), and [Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014.md) according to which the light of
the divine holiness is to sinners a consuming fire, which they cannot
endure. Now there follow specific designations of the wicked. הוללים
part. Kal = hōlalim, or even Poal = hôlalim (= מהוללים),

(Note: On the rule, according to which here, as in שׁוררי [Psa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md) and the like, a simple Sheb mobile
goes over into Chateph pathach with Gaja preceding it, vid., the
observations on giving a faithful representation of the O.T. text
according to the Masora in the Luther Zeitschr. 1863. S. 411. The
Babylonian Ben-Naphtali (about 940) prefers the simple Sheb in such
cases, as also in others; Ben-Asher of the school of Tiberias, whom the
Masora follows, and whom consequently our Masoretic text ought to
follow, prefers the Chateph, vid., Psalter ii. 460-467.)

are the foolish, and more especially foolish boasters; the primary
notion of the verb is not that of being hollow, but that of sounding,
then of loud boisterous, non-sensical behaviour. Of such it is said,
that they are not able to maintain their position when they become
manifest before the eye of God (לנגד as in [Psa
101:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#007.md) manifest before any one, from
נגד to come forward, be visible far off, be distinctly visible). פעלי
און are those who work (οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023)) iniquity; און breath (ἄνεμος.md) is
sometimes trouble, in connection with which one pants, sometimes
wickedness, in which there is not even a trace of any thing noble, true,
or pure. Such men Jahve hates; for if He did not hate evil ([Psa
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#005).md), His love would not be a holy
love. In דּברי כזב, דּברי is the usual form in combination when the
plur. is used, instead of מדבּרי. It is the same in [Psa
58:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004.md). The style of expression is also
Davidic in other respects, viz., אישׁ דּמים וּמרמה as in Ps 55:24, and
אבּד as in [Psa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006.md), cf. [Psa
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011.md). תּעב (in Amos, [Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008) תּאב.md) appears to be a secondary
formation from עוּב, like תּאב to desire, from אבה, and therefore to be
of a cognate root with the Aram. עיּב to despise, treat with indignity,
and the Arabic ‛aib a stain (cf. on [Lam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001).md). The fact that, as Hengstenberg
has observed, wickedness and the wicked are described in a sevenfold
manner is perhaps merely accidental.

[Psalms 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 5:7</span></span>

(Heb.: 5:8-10) Since the Psalm is a morning hymn, the futt. in [Psa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008.md) state what he, on the contrary,
may and will do ([Psa 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013).md). By the
greatness and fulness of divine favour ([Psa
116:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#014).md) he has access (εἴσοδον, for
בּוא means, according to its root, "to enter") to the sanctuary, and he
will accordingly repair thither to-day. It is the tabernacle on Zion in
which was the ark of the covenant that is meant here. That daily
liturgical service was celebrated there must be assumed, since the ark
of the covenant is the sign and pledge of Jahve's presence; and it is,
moreover, attested by [Ch1 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037.md). It
is also to be supposed that sacrifice was offered daily before the
tabernacle. For it is not to be inferred from [Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039.md). that sacrifice was only offered
regularly on the Bama (high place) in Gibeon before the Mosaic
tabernacle.

(Note: Thus, in particular, Sthelin, Zur Kritik der Psalmen in the
Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr. vi. (1852) S. 108 and Zur Einleitung in die
Psalmen. An academical programme, 1859. 4to.)

It is true sacrifice was offered in Gibeon, where the old tabernacle and
the old altars (or at least the altar of burnt-offering) were, and also
that after the removal of the ark to Zion both David ([Ch1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029)..md) and Solomon ([Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md); [Ch2
1:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#002).md) worshipped and sacrificed in
Gibeon. But it is self-evident sacrifices might have been offered where
the ark was, and that even with greater right than in Gibeon; and since
both David, upon its arrival ([Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017)..md), and Solomon after his
accession ([Kg1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015).md), offered
sacrifices through the priests who were placed there, it is probable-and
by a comparison of the Davidic Psalms not to be doubted-that there was a
daily service, in conjunction with sacrifices, before the ark on Zion.

But, moreover, is it really the אהל in Zion which is meant here in v. 8
by the house of God? It is still maintained by renowned critics that the
tabernacle pitched by David over the sacred ark is never called בית ה or
היכל or משׁכן ה or מקדשׁ or קדשׁ. But why could it not have all these
names? We will not appeal to the fact that the house of God at Shilo
([Sa1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009.md); [Sa1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003).md) is called בית and היכל ה, since
it may be objected that it was really more of a temple than a
tabernacle,

(Note: Vid., C. H. Graf, Commentation de templo Silonensi ad
illustrandum locum Jud. xviii. 30, 31, (1855, 4to.), in which he seeks
to prove that the sanctuary in Shilo was a temple to Jahve that lasted
until the dissolution of the kingdom of Israel.)

although in the same book, [Sa1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022.md)
it is called אהל מועד, and in connection with the other appellations the
poetic colouring of the historical style of 1 Sam 1-3 is to be taken
into consideration. Moreover, we put aside passages like [Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md); [Exo
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#026.md), since it may be said that the
future Temple was present to the mind of the Lawgiver. But in [Jos
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#024.md); [Sa2
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#020.md), the sanctuary is called בית ה
without being conceived of as a temple. Why then cannot the tabernacle,
which David pitched for the ark of the covenant when removed to Zion
([Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017).md), be called בית ה? It is
only when אהל and בּית are placed in opposition to one another that the
latter has the notion of a dwelling built of more solid materials; but
in itself beit (bt) in Semitic is the generic term for housing of every
kind whether it be made of wool, felt, and hair-cloth, or of earth,
stone, and wood; consequently it is just as much a tent as a house (in
the stricter sense of the word), whether the latter be a hut built of
wood and clay or a palace.

(Note: The Turkish Kamus says: "Arab. byt is a house (Turk. ew) in the
signification of châne (Persic the same), whether it be made of hair,
therefore a tent, or built of stone and tiles." And further on: "Beit
originally signified a place specially designed for persons to retire to
at night from Arab. bâta he has passed the night, if it does not perhaps
come from the בוא, Arab. bayya, which stands next to it in this passage,
vid., Job at [Job 29:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#015.md)\]; but
later on the meaning was extended and the special reference to the night
time was lost." Even at the present day the Beduin does not call his
tent ahl, but always bêt and in fact bêt sha'r (בית שׂער), the modern
expression for the older bêt wabar (hair-house).)

If a dwelling-house is frequently called אהל, then a tent that any one
dwells in may the more naturally be called his בּית. And this we find is
actually the case with the dwellings of the patriarchs, which, although
they were not generally solid houses ([Gen
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#017).md), are called בית ([Gen
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#015).md). Moreover, היכל (from יכל =
כּוּל to hold, capacem esse), although it signifies a palace does not
necessarily signify one of stone, for the heavens are also called
Jahve's היכל, e.g., [Psa 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md), and not
necessarily one of gigantic proportions, for even the Holy of holies of
Solomon's Temple, and this par excellence, is called היכל, and once,
[Kg1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003.md), היכל הבּית. Of the
spaciousness and general character of the Davidic tabernacle we know
indeed nothing: it certainly had its splendour, and was not so much a
substitute for the original tabernacle, which according to the testimony
of the chronicler remained in Gibeon, as a substitute for the Temple
that was still to be built. But, however insignificant it may have been,
Jahve had His throne there, and it was therefore the היבל of a great
king, just as the wall-less place in the open field where God manifested
Himself with His angels to the homeless Jacob was בּית אלהים ([Gen
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#017).md).

Into this tabernacle of God, i.e., into its front court, will David
enter (בּוא with acc. as in [Psa
66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013).md) this morning, there will he
prostrate himself in worship, προσκυνεῖν (השׁתּחוה) reflexive of the
Pilel שׁחוה, Ges. 75, rem. 18), towards (אל as in [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md), [Kg1
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029.md), [Kg1
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#035.md), cf. ל [Psa
99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md), [Psa
99:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#009).md) Jahve's היכל קדשׁ, i.e., the
דּביר, the Holy of holies [Psa 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md),
and that "in Thy fear," i.e., in reverence before Thee (genit.
objectivus). The going into the Temple which David purposes, leads his
thoughts on to his way through life, and the special de'eesis, which
only begins here, moulds itself accordingly: he prays for God's gracious
guidance as in [Psa 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011.md); [Psa
86:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#011.md), and frequently. The direction
of God, by which he wishes to be guided he calls צדקה. Such is the
general expression for the determination of conduct by an ethical rule.
The rule, acting in accordance with which, God is called par excellence
צדיק, is the order of salvation which opens up the way of mercy to
sinners. When God forgives those who walk in this way their sins, and
stands near to bless and protect them, He shows Himself not less צדיק
(just), than when He destroys those who despise Him, in the heat of His
rejected love. By this righteousness, which accords with the counsel and
order of mercy, David prays to be led למען שׁוררי, in order that the
malicious desire of those who lie in wait for him may not be fulfilled,
but put to shame, and that the honour of God may not be sullied by him.
שׁורר is equivalent to משׁורר (Aquila ἐφοδεύων, Jerome insidiator) from
the Pilel שׁורר to fix one's eyes sharply upon, especially of hostile
observation. David further prays that God will make his way (i.e., the
way in which a man must walk according to God's will) even and straight
before him, the prayer one, in order that he may walk therein without
going astray and unimpeded. The adj. ישׂר signifies both the
straightness of a line and the evenness of a surface. The fut. of the
Hiph. הישׁיר is יישׁיר in [Pro 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#025.md),
and accordingly the Ker substitutes for the imper. הושׁר the
corresponding form הישׁר, just as in [Isa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002.md) it removes the Hiphil form אושׁר
(cf. [Gen 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#017) הוצא Keri היצא.md),
without any grammatical, but certainly not without some traditional
ground.

כּי in [Psa 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010.md) is closely connected
with למען שׁוררי: on account of my way-layers, for the following are
their characteristics. אין is separated by בּפיהוּ (= בּפיו [Psa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005).md) from נכונה the word it governs;
this was the more easily possible as the usage of the language almost
entirely lost sight of the fact that אין is the construct of אין, Ges.
152, 1. In his mouth is nothing that should stand firm, keep its ground,
remain the same (cf. [Job 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007)..md). The
singular suffix of בפיהו has a distributive meaning: in ore
unuiscujusque eorum. Hence the sing. at once passes over into the plur.:
קרבּם הוּות their inward part, i.e., that towards which it goes forth
and in which it has its rise (vid., [Psa
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012).md) is הוות corruption, from הוּה
which comes from הוה = Arab. hawâ, to yawn, gape, χαίνειν, hiare, a
yawning abyss and a gaping vacuum, and then, inasmuch as, starting from
the primary idea of an empty space, the verbal significations libere
ferri (especially from below upwards) and more particularly animo ad or
in aliquid ferri are developed, it obtains the pathological sense of
strong desire, passion, just as it does also the intellectual sense of a
loose way of thinking proceeding from a self-willed tendency (vid.,
Fleischer on [Job 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006).md). In Hebrew the
prevalent meaning of the word is corruption, [Psa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md), which is a metaphor for the
abyss, barathrum, (so far, but only so far Schultens on [Pro
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003) is right.md), and proceeding from
this meaning it denotes both that which is physically corruptible ([Job
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#030).md) and, as in the present passage
and frequently, that which is corruptible from an ethical point of view.
The meaning strong desire, in which הוּה looks as though it only
differed from אוּה in one letter, occurs only in [Psa
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009.md); [Pro
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003.md); [Mic
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003.md). The substance of their inward
part is that which is corruptible in every way, and their throat, as the
organ of speech, as in [Psa 115:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007.md);
[Psa 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md), cf. [Psa
69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004.md), is (perhaps a figure connected
with the primary meaning of הוות) a grave, which yawns like jaws, which
open and snatch and swallow down whatever comes in their way. To this
"they make smooth their tongue" is added as a circumstantial clause.
Their throat is thus formed and adapted, while they make smooth their
tongue (cf. [Pro 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016).md), in order to
conceal their real design beneath flattering language. From this
meaning, החליק directly signifies to flatter in [Psa
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#003.md); [Pro
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#005.md). The last two lines of the
strophe are formed according to the caesura schema. This schema is also
continued in the concluding strophe.

[Psalms 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 5:10</span></span>

(Heb.: 5:11-13) The verb אשׁם or אשׁם unites in itself the three closely
allied meanings of becoming guilty (e.g., [Lev
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#019).md), of a feeling of guilt ([Lev
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004)..md), and of expiation ([Psa
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#022)..md); just as the verbal adj. אשׁם
also signifies both liable to punishment and expiating, and the
substantive אשׁם both the guilt to be expiated and the expiation. The
Hiph. האשׁים signifies to cause any one to render the expiation due to
his fault, to make him do penance. As an exception God is here, in the
midst of the Jehovic Psalms, called אלהים, perhaps not altogether
unintentionally as being God the Judge. The מן of ממּעצותיהם (with Gaja
by the מן and a transition of the counter-tone Metheg into Galgal, as in
[Hos 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006.md) into Meajla, vid., Psalter
ii. 526) is certainly that of the cause in [Hos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006.md), but here it is to be explained
with Olsh. and Hitz. according to Sir. 14:2, Judith 11:6 (cf. [Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006).md): may they fall from their own
counsels, i.e., founder in the execution of them. Therefore מן in the
sense of "down from, away," a sense which the parallel הדּיחמו thrust
them away (cf. דּחוּ from דּחה Ps 36:13), presupposes. The ב of בּרב is
to be understood according to [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021.md), [Joh
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024.md) "ye shall die ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις
ὑμῶν." The multitude of their transgressions shall remain unforgiven and
in this state God is to cast them into hades. The ground of this
terrible prayer is set forth by כּי מרוּ בך. The tone of מרוּ, for a
well-known reason (cf. e.g., [Psa
37:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#040.md); 64:11; [Psa
72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017).md) has retreated to the penult.
מרה, root מר, prop. to be or hold one's self stiff towards any one,
compare Arab. mârr, tmârr, to press and stiffen against one another in
wrestling, Arab. mârâ, tmârâ, to struggle against anything, whether with
outward or mental and moral opposition. Their obstinacy is not obstinacy
against a man, but against God Himself; their sin is, therefore, Satanic
and on that account unpardonable. All the prayers of this character are
based upon the assumption expressed in [Psa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013.md), that those against whom they are
directed do not wish for mercy. Accordingly their removal is prayed for.
Their removal will make the ecclesia pressa free and therefore joyous.
From this point of view the prayer in [Psa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012.md) is inspired by the prospect of
the result of their removal. The futt. do not express a wish, but a
consequence. The division of the verse is, however, incorrect. The rise
of the first half of the verse closes with בך (the pausal form by
Pazer), its fall is לעולם ירנּנוּ; then the rise begins anew in the
second half, extending to בך which ought likewise to be pointed בך, and
אהבי שׁמך is its fall. ותסך עלימו (from הסך Hiph. of סכך [Psa
91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004).md) is awkward in this sequence of
thoughts. Hupfeld and Hitzig render it: "they shall rejoice for ever
whom Thou defendest;" but then it ought not only to be pointed ירנּנוּ,
but the ו must also be removed, and yet there is nothing to characterise
תסך עלימו as being virtually a subject. On the other hand it does not
harmonise with the other consecutive futures. It must therefore, like
יפּלוּ, be the optative: "And do Thou defend them, then shall those who
love Thy name rejoice in Thee." And then upon this this joy of those who
love the name of Jahve (i.e., God in His revelation of Himself in
redemption) Ps 69:37; [Psa 119:132](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#132.md), is
based by כּי־אתּה from a fact of universal experience which is the sum
of all His historical self-attestations. עלימו is used instead of עליהם
as a graver form of expression, just like הדּיחמו for הדּיחם as an
indignant one. The form ויעלצוּ (Ges. 63, 3) is chosen instead of the
יעלצוּ found in [Psa 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md); [Psa
68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004.md), in order to assist the rhythm.
The futt. are continuative. תּעטרנּוּ, cinges eum, is not a contracted
Hiph. according to [Sa1 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#025.md), but Kal
as in [Sa1 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#026.md); here it is used like
the Piel in [Psa 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006.md) with a double
accusative. The צנּה (from צנן Arab. tsân, med. Waw, Aethiop. צון to
hedge round, guard) is a shield of a largest dimensions; larger than מגן
[Kg1 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016.md). (cf. [Sa1
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#007.md), where Goliath has his צנּה borne
by a shield-bearer). כּצּנּה "like a shield" is equivalent to: as with a
shield (Ges. 118, 3, rem.). The name of God, יהוה, is correctly drawn to
the second member of the verse by the accentuation, in order to balance
it with the first; and for this reason the first clause does not begin
with כי־אתה יהוה here as it does elsewhere (Ps 4:9; [Psa
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#008).md). רצון delight, goodwill, is also
a synonym for the divine blessing in [Deu
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023.md).
