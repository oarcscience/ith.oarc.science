### [Exodus Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 30:1</span></span>

The Altar of Incense and Incense-Offering bring the directions
concerning the sanctuary to a close. What follows, from Ex 30:11-31:17,
is shown to be merely supplementary to the larger whole by the formula
"and Jehovah spake unto Moses," with which every separate command is
introduced (cf. [Exo 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011.md), [Exo
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017.md), [Exo
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022.md), [Exo
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#024.md), [Exo
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001.md), [Exo
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#012).md).

[Exo 30:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md)

(cf. [Exo 37:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#025).md). Moses was
directed to make an altar of burning of incense (lit., incensing of
incense), of acacia-wood, one cubit long and one broad, four-cornered,
two cubits high, furnished with horns like the altar of burnt-offering
([Exo 27:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001).md), and to plate it with
pure gold, the roof (גּג) thereof (i.e., its upper side or surface,
which was also made of wood), and its walls round about, and its horns;
so that it was covered with gold quite down to the ground upon which it
stood, and for this reason is often called the golden altar ([Exo
39:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#038.md); [Exo
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#005.md), [Exo
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#026.md); [Num
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#011).md). Moreover it was to be
ornamented with a golden wreath, and furnished with golden rings at the
corners for the carrying-poles, as the ark of the covenant and the table
of shew-bread were ([Exo 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#011.md)., [Exo
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#025)..md); and its place was to be in
front of the curtain, which concealed the ark of the covenant ([Exo
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031).md), "before the capporeth" ([Exo
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#005).md), so that, although it really
stood in the holy place between the candlestick on the south side and
the table on the north ([Exo 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#035.md);
[Exo 40:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#022.md), [Exo
40:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#024).md), it was placed in the closest
relation to the capporeth, and for this reason is not only connected
with the most holy place in [Kg1 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#022.md),
but is reckoned in [Heb 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004.md) as part of
the furniture of the most holy place (see Delitzsch on [Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004).md).

[Exo 30:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007.md)

Upon this altar Aaron was to burn fragrant incense, the preparation of
which is described in [Exo 30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034.md).,
every morning and evening before Jehovah, at the time when he trimmed
the lamps. No "strange incense" was to be offered upon it, - i.e.,
incense which Jehovah had not appointed (cf. [Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001).md), that is to say, which had not
been prepared according to His instructions-nor burnt sacrifice, nor
meat-offering; and no drink-offering was to be poured upon it. As the
altar of incense was not only marked as a place of sacrifice by its name
מזבּח, "place of slain-offering," but was put on a par with the altar of
sacrifice by its square shape and its horns, it was important to
describe minutely what sacrifices were to be offered upon it. For the
burning of fragrant incense is shown to be a sacrifice, by the fact that
it was offered upon a place of sacrifice, or altar. Moreover the word
הקטיר, to cause to ascend in smoke and steam, from קטר to smoke or
steam, is not only applied to the lighting of incense, but also to the
lighting and burning of the bleeding and bloodless sacrifices upon the
altar of incense. Lastly, the connection between the incense-offering
and the burnt-offering is indicated by the rule that they were to be
offered at the same time. Both offerings shadowed forth the devotion of
Israel to its God, whilst the fact that they were offered every day
exhibited this devotion as constant and uninterrupted. But the
distinction between them consisted in this, that in the burnt or whole
offering Israel consecrated and sanctified its whole life and action in
both body and soul to the Lord, whilst in the incense-offering its
prayer was embodied as the exaltation of the spiritual man to God (cf.
[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md); [Rev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008.md); [Rev
8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003).md); and with this there was
associated the still further distinction, that the devotion was
completed in the burnt-offering solely upon the basis of the atoning
sprinkling of blood, whereas the incense-offering presupposed
reconciliation with God, and on the basis of this the soul rose to God
in this embodiment of its prayer, and was thus absorbed into His Spirit.
In this respect, the incense-offering was not only a spiritualizing and
transfiguring of the burnt-offering, but a completion of that offering
also.

[Exo 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010.md)

Once a year Aaron was to expiate the altar of incense with the blood of
the sin-offering of atonement, because it was most holy to the Lord,
that is to say, as is expressly observed in the directions concerning
this expiatory act ([Lev 16:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#018).md), to
purify it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel. כּפּר, with
על objecti constr., signifies literally to cover over a thing, then to
cover over sin, or make expiation. In the second clause we have "upon
it" (the altar) instead of "upon the horns of it," because the altar
itself was expiated in its horns. The use of מן in מדּם is to be
explained on the ground that only a part of the blood of the
sin-offering was smeared with the finger upon the horns. (For further
remarks, see at [Lev 16:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#018)..md) The
term "most holy" is not only applied to this altar, in common with the
inner division of the tabernacle ([Exo
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033).md), but also to the altar of
burnt-offering ([Exo 29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037.md); [Exo
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#010).md), and all the vessels of the
sanctuary ([Exo 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#029).md), which were
anointed with holy oil; then to the whole of the tabernacle in its
holiest aspect ([Num 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#010).md); and
lastly, to all the sacrifices, which were given up entirely to Jehovah
(see at [Lev 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003).md); - consequently to
everything which stood in so intimate a relation to Jehovah as to be
altogether removed, not only from use and enjoyment on the part of man,
but also from contact on the part of unsanctified men. Whoever touched a
most holy thing was sanctified thereby (compare [Exo
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#029.md) with [Exo
29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037).md).

[Exodus 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 30:11</span></span>

The Atonement-Money, which every Israelite had to pay at the numbering
of the people, has the first place among the supplementary instructions
concerning the erection and furnishing of the sanctuary, and serves to
complete the demand for freewill-offerings for the sanctuary ([Exo
25:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001).md).

[Exo 30:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012.md)

"When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel according to them
that are numbered, they shall give every one an expiation for his soul
to the Lord at their numbering, that a plague may not strike them
(happen to them) at their numbering." פּקד, lit., adspexit, then
inspexit explorandi causa, hence to review, or number an army or a
nation, for the purpose of enrolling for military service. לפקדיהם with
reference to the numbered, qui in censum veniunt. כּפר (expiation,
expiation-money, from כּפּר to expiate) is to be traced to the idea that
the object for which expiation was made was thereby withdrawn from the
view of the person to be won or reconciled. It is applied in two ways:
(1) on the supposition that the face of the person to be won was covered
by the gift ([Gen 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#021.md); [Sa1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003)); and (2.md) on the supposition that
the guilt itself was covered up ([Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001).md), or wiped away ([Jer
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#023).md), so far as the eye of God was
concerned, as though it had no longer any existence, and that the sinful
man was protected from the punishment of the judge in consequence of
this covering. In this way כּפר has acquired the meaning λύτρον, a
payment by which the guilty are redeemed ([Exo
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#030.md); [Num
35:31](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#031).md); and this is the meaning which
it has in the passage before us, where the soul is said to be protected
by the copher, so as to be able to come without danger into the presence
of the holy God ([Num 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019.md). See Oehler
in Herzog's Cycl.). Such an approach to God took place at the numbering
of the people for the purpose of enrolling them in the army of Jehovah
([Num 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003.md), cf. [Exo
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#004.md); [Exo
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#041).md). Hence "every one who passed
over to those that were numbered," who was enrolled among them, i.e., in
the army of Jehovah, - that is to say, every male Israelite of 20 years
old and upwards ([Exo 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#014).md), - was to
pay half a shekel of the sanctuary as atonement-money; the rich no more,
the poor no less ([Exo 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#015).md), because
all were equal in the sight of Jehovah; and this payment was to be a
"heave" (terumah, see [Exo 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#002).md) for
Jehovah for the expiation of the souls. The shekel of the sanctuary,
which contained 20 gerahs, was no doubt the original shekel of full
weight, as distinguished from the lighter shekel which was current in
ordinary use. In [Exo 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#026.md) the half
shekel is called בּקע, lit., the split, i.e., half, from בּקע to split;
and we find it mentioned as early as the time of the patriarchs as a
weight in common use for valuing gold ([Gen
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022).md), so that, no doubt, even at
that time there were distinct silver pieces of this weight, which were
probably called shekels when employed for purposes of trade, since the
word shekel itself does not denote any particular weight, as we may
perceive at once form a comparison of [Kg1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017.md) and [Ch2
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#016.md), at least so far as later times
are concerned. The sacred shekel, to judge from the weight of Maccabean
shekels, which are in existence still, and vary from 256 to 272 Parisian
grains, weighed 274 grains, and therefore, according to present
valuation, would be worth 26 groschen (about 2s. 7d.), so that the
half-shekel of bekah would be 13 groschen (1s. 3 1/2d.).

[Exo 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#016.md)

This atonement-money Moses was to appropriate to the work of the
sanctuary (cf. [Exo 38:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#025.md), where
the amount and appropriation are reported). Through this appropriation
it became "a memorial to the children of Israel before the Lord to
expiate their souls," i.e., a permanent reminder of their expiation
before the Lord, who would henceforth treat them as reconciled because
of this payment. It was no ordinary tribute, therefore, which Israel was
to pay to Jehovah as its King, but an act demanded by the holiness of
the theocratic covenant. As an expiation for souls, it pointed to the
unholiness of Israel's nature, and reminded the people continually, that
by nature it was alienated from God, and could only remain in covenant
with the Lord and live in His kingdom on the ground of His grace, which
covered its sin. It was not till this sinful nature had been sanctified
by a perfect atonement, and servitude under the law had been glorified
and fully transformed into that sonship to which Israel was called as
the first-born son of Jehovah, that as children of the kingdom they had
no longer to pay this atonement-money for their souls ([Mat
17:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#025).md). - According to [Num
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md), [Num
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#018.md), as compared with [Exo
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017.md), the census of the nation was
not taken till a month after the building of the tabernacle was
completed, and yet the atonement-money to be paid at the taking of the
census was to be appropriated to the purpose of the building, and must
therefore have been paid before. This apparent discrepancy may be
reconciled by the simple assumption, that immediately after the command
of God had been issued respecting the building of the tabernacle and the
contributions which the people were to make for the purpose, the
numbering of the males was commenced and the atonement-money collected
from the different individuals, that the tabernacle was then built and
the whole ceremonial instituted, and that, after all this had been done,
the whole nation was enrolled according to its tribes, fathers' houses,
and families, on the basis of this provisional numbering, and thus the
census was completed. For this reason the census gave exactly the same
number of males as the numbering (cf. [Exo
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#026.md) and [Num
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#046).md), although the one had been
carried out nine months before the other.

[Exodus 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 30:17</span></span>

(cf. [Exo 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008).md). The Brazen Laver, and
its use. - The making of this vessel is not only mentioned in a
supplementary manner, but no description is given of it because of the
subordinate position which it occupied, and from the fact that it was
not directly connected with the sanctuary, but was only used by the
priests to cleanse themselves for the performance of their duties.
כּיּור: a basin, a round, caldron-shaped vessel. כּגּו (its support): by
this we are not to understand the pedestal of the caldron, but something
separate from the basin, which was no doubt used for drawing off as much
water as was required for washing the officiating priests. For although
כּן belongs to כּיּור, the fact that it is always specially mentioned in
connection with the basin necessarily leads to the conclusion, that it
had a certain kind of independence (cf. [Exo
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#009.md); [Exo
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#016.md); [Exo
39:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#039.md); [Exo
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#011.md); [Lev
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#011).md). These two vessels were to be
made of brass or copper, like the other things in the court; and,
according to [Exo 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008.md), they were made
of the brass of the mirrors of the women who served before the door of
the tabernacle. הצּבאת בּמראת does not mean either "provided with
mirrors of the women" (Bhr, i. pp. 485-6), or ornamented "with forms,
figures of women, as they were accustomed to appear at the sanctuary"
(Knobel). But these views are overthrown by the fact, that ב never
signifies with in the sense of an outward addition, but always denotes
the means, "not an independent object, but something accompanying and
contributing to the action referred to" (Ewald, 217, f. 3). In this case
ב can only apply to the material used, whether we connect it with ויּעשׂ
as in [Exo 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#004.md), or, what seems
decidedly more correct, with נחשׁת as a more precise definition; so that
ב would denote that particular quality which distinguished the brass of
which the basin was made (Ewald, 217f.), - apart altogether from the
fact, that neither the mirrors of women, nor the figures of women, would
form a fitting ornament for the basin, as the priests did not require to
look at themselves when they washed their hands and feet; and there is
still less ground for Knobel's fiction, that Levitical women went to the
sanctuary at particular times, forming a certain procession, and taking
things with them for the purpose of washing, cleaning, and polishing.
The true meaning is given by the Septuagint, ἐκ τῶν κατόπτρων. According
to [Sa1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022.md), the צבאת were women,
though not washer-women, but women who dedicated their lives to the
service of Jehovah, and spent them in religious exercises, in fasting
and in prayer, like Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, mentioned in [Luk
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037.md).

(Note: Knobel's objection to this explanation, viz., that "at a time
when the sanctuary was not yet erected, the author could not speak of
women as coming to the door of the sanctuary, or performing religious
service there," would contain its own refutation, if there were any
ground for it at all. For before the sanctuary was erected, the author
could not speak of Levitical women as coming at particular times to the
sanctuary, and bringing things with them for the purpose of washing and
cleaning. But the participle צבאת does not imply that they had served
there before the erection of the sanctuary, but only that from that time
forward, they did perform service there.)

צבא denotes spiritual warfare, and is accordingly rendered by the lxx
νηστεύειν, by Onkelos, orare, with which the Rabbins agree. The mirrors
of the women had been used for the purpose of earthly adorning. But now
the pious Israelites renounced this earthly adorning, and offered it to
the Lord as a heave-offering to make the purifying laver in front of the
sanctuary, in order that "what had hitherto served as a means of
procuring applause in the world might henceforth be the means of
procuring the approbation of God" (Hengstenberg, Dissert. vol. ii.). -
The laver was to be placed between the tabernacle, i.e., the dwelling,
and the altar in the court ([Exo
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018).md), probably not in a straight
line with the door of the dwelling and the altar of burnt-offering, but
more sideways, so as to be convenient for the use of the priests,
whether they were going into the tabernacle, or going up to the altar
for service, to kindle a firing for Jehovah, i.e., to offer sacrifice
upon the altar. They were to wash their hands, with which they touched
the holy things, and their feet, with which they trod the holy ground
(see [Exo 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#005).md), "that they might not
die," as is again emphatically stated in [Exo
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#020.md) and [Exo
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#021.md). For touching holy things with
unclean hands, and treading upon the floor of the sanctuary with dirty
feet, would have been a sin against Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel,
deserving of death. These directions do not imply "that, notwithstanding
all their consecration, they were regarded as still defiled by natural
uncleanness" (Baumgarten), but rather that consecration did not stamp
them with a character indelebilis, or protect them from the impurities
of the sinful nation in the midst of which they lived, or of their own
nature, which was still affected with mortal corruption and sin.

[Exodus 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 30:22</span></span>

The Holy Anointing Oil. - This was to be prepared from the best perfumes
ראשׁע בּשׂמים, where ראשׁע, caput, the principal or chief, is
subordinate to בּשׂמים), viz., of four fragrant spices and olive-oil.
The spices were, (1) liquid myrrh, as distinguished from the dry gum; -
(2) קנּמן־בּשׂם, cinnamon of fragrance, the name having been introduced
to the Semitic nations along with the thing itself, and then by the
Phoenicians to the Greeks and Romans (κίνναμον, cinnamum): whether it
came from Ceylon, the great mart of cinnamon, is very doubtful, as there
is not word that can be discovered in the Indian dialects corresponding
to cinnamon; - (3) cane of fragrance, the κάλαμος ἀρωματικός, calamus
odoratus, of the Greek sand Romans, i.e., the scented calamus which is
imported from India; - and (4) kiddah, probably cassia, and possibly the
species called κιττώ in Dioscor. 1, 12, in which case קציעה ([Psa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009).md) is either the generic name for
cassia, or else refers to a different species. The proportion in which
these spices were to be taken was 500 shekels or 14 1/2 lbs. of myrrh,
half the quantity, i.e., 7 lbs, of cinnamon, and the same of calamus and
cassia; in all, therefore, 21 lbs. of dry spices, which were to be mixed
with one hin of oil (about 5 quarts) and 14 lbs. of liquid myrrh. These
proportions preclude the supposition, that the spices were pulverized
and mixed with the oil and myrrh in their natural condition, for the
result in that case would have been a thick mess: they rather favour the
statement of the Rabbins, that the dry spices were softened in water and
boiled, to extract their essence, which was then mixed with oil and
myrrh, and boiled again until all the watery part had evaporated. An
artificial production of this kind is also indicated by the expressions
מרקחת רקח "spice-work of spice-mixture," and רקח מעשׂה "labour (work) of
the perfumer or ointment-maker."

[Exodus 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 30:26</span></span>

(see at [Lev 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010)..md). This anointing
oil was holy, either because it was made from the four fragrant
substances according to the proportions commanded by Jehovah, or because
God declared this kind of mixture and preparation holy (cf. [Exo
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#032).md), and forbade for all time, on
pain of death ([Exo 30:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#031).md), not only
the use of ointment so prepared for any ordinary anointings, but even an
imitation of it. "Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured," i.e., it is
not to be used for the ordinary practice of anointing the human body
([Exo 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#032).md). "Man," i.e., the
ordinary man in distinction from the priests. בּמתכּנתּו according to
its measure, i.e., according to the proportions prescribed for its
manufacture. זר ([Exo 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#033).md) a
stranger, is not only the non-Israelite, but laymen or non-priests in
general. On the expression, "cut off from his people," see at [Gen
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#014.md).

[Exodus 30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 30:34</span></span>

The Holy Incense was also to be made of four ingredients, viz., (1)
nataph (στακτή, stacte), i.e., not the resinous myrrh, or sap obtained
from the fragrant myrrh and dried, but a kind of storax gum resembling
myrrh, which was baked, and then used, like incense, for fumigating; -
(2) shecheleth (ὄνυξ, ungius odoratus), the shell of a shell-fish
resembling the purpura, of an agreeable odour; - (3) chelbenah
(χαλβάνη), a resin of a pungent, bitter flavour, obtained, by means of
an incision in the bark, from the ferula, a shrub which grows in Syria,
Arabia, and Abyssinia, and then mixed with fragrant substances to give
greater pungency to their odour; - and (4) lebonah (λίβανος or
λιβανωτός), frankincense, a resin of a pleasant smell, obtained from a
tree in Arabia Felix or India, but what tree has not been discovered.
זכּה pure, i.e., unadulterated. The words יהיה בּבד בּד "part for part
shall it be," are explained by the lxx as meaning ἴσον ἴσῳ ἔσται, Vulg.
aequalis ponderis erunt omnia, i.e., with equal parts of all the
different substances. But this is hardly correct, as בּד literally means
separation, and the use of ב in this sense would be very striking. The
explanation given by Aben Ezra is more correct, viz., "every part shall
be for itself;" that is to say, each part was to be first of all
prepared by itself, and then all the four to be mixed together
afterwards.

[Exo 30:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#035.md)

Of this Moses was to make incense, spicework, etc. (as in [Exo
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025).md), salted, seasoned with salt
(ממלּח, a denom. from מלח salt), like the meat-offering in [Lev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013.md). The word does not mean
μεμιγμένον, mixtum (lxx, Vulg.), or rubbed to powder, for the rubbing or
pulverizing is expressed by שׁחקתּ־הרק in the following verse.

[Exo 30:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#036.md)

Of this incense (a portion) was to be placed "before the testimony in
the tabernacle," i.e., not in the most holy place, but where the altar
of incense stood (cf. [Exo 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006.md) and
[Lev 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012).md). The remainder was of
course to be kept elsewhere.

[Exo 30:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#037.md)

There is the same prohibition against imitating or applying it to a
strange use as in the case of the anointing oil ([Exo
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#032.md), [Exo
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#033).md). "To smell thereto," i.e., to
enjoy the perfume of it.
