### [2 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 4:1</span></span>

[Ch2 4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001.md). The copper furniture of
the court. [Ch2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001.md). The altar of
burnt-offering. Its preparation is passed over in 1 Kings 6 and 7, so
that there it is only mentioned incidentally in connection with the
consecration of the temple, [Kg1 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022.md),
[Kg1 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054.md), and [Kg1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025.md). It was twenty cubits square
(long and broad) and ten cubits high, and constructed on the model of
the Mosaic altar of burnt-offering, and probably of brass plates, which
enclosed the inner core, consisting of earth and unhewn stones; and if
we may judge from Ezekiel's description, [Eze
43:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013.md), it rose in steps, as it
were, so that at each step its extent was smaller; and the measurement
of twenty cubits refers only to the lowest scale, while the space at the
top, with the hearth, was only twelve cubits square; cf. my Bibl.
Archaeol. i. S. 127, with the figure, plate iii. fig. 2.

[2 Chronicles 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 4:2</span></span>

The brazen sea described as in [Kg1
7:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023.md). See the commentary on that
passage, and the sketch in my Archaeol. i. plate iii. fig. 1. The
differences in substance, such as the occurrence of בּקרים and הבּקר,
[Ch2 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#003.md), instead of פּקעים and
הפּקים, and 3000 baths instead of 2000, are probably the result of
orthographical errors in the Chronicle. יכיל in [Ch2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#005.md) appears superfluous after the
preceding מחזיק, and Berth. considers it a gloss which has come from 1
Kings into our text by mistake. But the expression is only pleonastic:
"receiving baths, 3000 it held;" and there is no sufficient reason to
strike out the words.

[2 Chronicles 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 4:6</span></span>

The ten lavers which, according to [Kg1
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038.md), stood upon ten brazen stands,
i.e., chests provided with carriage wheels. These stands, the artistic
work on which is circumstantially described in [Kg1
7:27-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027.md), are omitted in the Chronicle,
because they are merely subordinate parts of the lavers. The size or
capacity of the lavers is not stated, only their position on both sides
of the temple porch, and the purpose for which they were designed, "to
wash therein, viz., the work of the burnt-offering (the flesh of the
burnt-offering which was to be burnt upon the altar) they rinsed
therein," being mentioned. For details, see in [Kg1
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038.md). and the figure in my Archaol. i.
plate iii. fig. 4. Occasion is here taken to mention in a supplementary
way the use of the brazen sea.

[2 Chronicles 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 4:7</span></span>

The golden furniture of the holy place and the courts. These three
verses are not found in the parallel narrative 1 Kings 7, where in [Kg1
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#039.md) the statement as to the position
of the brazen sea ([Ch2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#010).md) follows
immediately the statement of the position of the stands with the lavers.
The candlesticks and the table of the shew-bread are indeed mentioned in
the summary enumeration of the temple furniture, [Kg1
7:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048.md) and [Kg1
7:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049.md), as in the corresponding passage
of the Chronicle ([Ch2 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019.md), [Ch2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#020).md) they again occur; and in [Kg1
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036.md) and [Kg1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#012.md), in the description of the temple
building, the inner court is spoken of, but the outer court is not
expressly mentioned. No reason can be given for the omission of these
verses in 1 Kings 7; but that they have been omitted or have dropped
out, may be concluded from the fact that not only do the whole contents
of our fourth chapter correspond to the section 1 Kings 7:23-50, but
both passages are rounded off by the same concluding verse ([Ch2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md) and [Kg1
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051).md).

[Ch2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007.md)

He made ten golden candlesticks כּמשׁפּטם, according to their right,
i.e., as they should be according to the prescript, or corresponding to
the prescript as to the golden candlesticks in the Mosaic sanctuary
([Exo 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031)..md). משׁפּט is the law
established by the Mosaic legislation.

[Ch2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#008.md)

Ten golden tables, corresponding to the ten candlesticks, and, like
these, placed five on the right and five on the left side of the holy
place. The tables were not intended to bear the candlesticks (Berth.),
but for the shew-bread; cf. on [Ch2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019.md) and [Ch1
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#016.md). And a hundred golden basins,
not for the catching and sprinkling of the blood (Berth.), but, as their
connection with the tables for the shew-bread shows, wine flagons, or
sacrificial vessels for wine libations, probably corresponding to the
מנקּיּות on the table of shew-bread in the tabernacle ([Exo
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029).md). The signification, wine
flagons, for מזרקים, is placed beyond a doubt by [Amo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006.md).

[2 Chronicles 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 4:9</span></span>

The two courts are not further described. For the court of the priests,
see on [Kg1 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036.md) and [Kg1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#012.md). As to the great or outer court,
the only remark made is that it had doors, and its doors, i.e., the
folds or leaves of the doors, were overlaid with copper. In [Ch2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#010.md) we have a supplementary statement
as to the position of the brazen sea, which coincides with [Kg1
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#039.md); see on the passage. In [Ch2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011) the heavier brazen (copper.md)
utensils, belonging to the altar of burnt-offering, are mentioned:
סידות, pots for the removal of the ashes; יעים, shovels, to take the
ashes out from the altar; and מזרקות, basins to catch and sprinkle the
sacrificial blood. This half verse belongs to the preceding,
notwithstanding that Huram is mentioned as the maker. This is clear
beyond doubt, from the fact that the same utensils are again introduced
in the summary catalogue which follows ([Ch2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016).md).

[2 Chronicles 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 4:11</span></span>

Summary catalogue of the temple utensils and furniture. - [Ch2
4:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011.md). The brass work wrought by
Huram.

[2 Chronicles 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 4:19</span></span>

The golden furniture of the holy place and the gilded doors of the
temple. This section is found also in [Kg1
7:40-50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040.md). The enumeration of the things
wrought in brass coincides to a word, with the exception of trifling
linguistic differences and some defects in the text, with [Kg1
7:40-47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040.md). In [Ch2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#012.md) והכּתרות הגּלּות is the true
reading, and we should so read in [Kg1
7:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#041.md) also, since the גּלּות,
circumvolutions, are to be distinguished from the כּתרות, crowns; see on
[Ch2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#016.md). In [Ch2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#014.md) the first עשׂה is a mistake for
עשׂר, the second for עשׂרה, [Kg1 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#043.md);
for the verb עשׂה is not required nor expected, as the accusative
depends upon לעשׂות, [Ch2 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011.md), while
the number cannot be omitted, since it is always given with the other
things. In [Ch2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016.md) מזלנות is an
orthographic error for מזרקות; cf. [Ch2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011.md) and [Kg1
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#044.md). ואת־כּל־כּליחם is surprising,
for there is no meaning in speaking of the utensils of the utensils
enumerated in [Ch2 4:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#012.md). According
to [Kg1 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045.md), we should read האלּה
כּל־הכּלים את. As to אביו, see on [Ch2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#012.md). מרוּק נחשׁת is accusative of the
material, of polished brass; and so also ממרט נח, [Kg1
7:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045.md), with a similar signification. In
reference to the rest, see the commentary on [Kg1
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040.md).

[Ch2 4:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019.md)

In the enumeration of the golden furniture of the holy place, our text
diverges somewhat more from [Kg1
7:48-50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048.md). On the difference in respect
to the tables of the shew-bread, see on [Kg1
7:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048.md). In [Ch2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#020.md) the number and position of the
candlesticks in the holy place are not stated as they are in [Kg1
7:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049.md), both having been already given
in [Ch2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007.md). Instead of that, their
use is emphasized: to light them, according to the right, before the
most holy place (כּמּשׁפּט as in [Ch2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007).md). As to the decorations and
subordinate utensils of the candlesticks, see on [Kg1
7:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049.md). To זהב, [Ch2
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#021) (accus. of the material.md), is
added זהב מכלות הוּא, "that is perfect gold." מכלה, which occurs only
here, is synonymous with מכלל, perfection. This addition seems
superfluous, because before and afterwards it is remarked of these
vessels that they were of precious gold (סגוּר זהב), and it is
consequently omitted by the lxx, perhaps also because מכלות was not
intelligible to them. The words, probably, are meant to indicate that
even the decorations and the subordinate utensils of the candlesticks
(lamps, snuffers, etc.) were of solid gold, and not merely gilded.

[Ch2 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#022.md)

מזמּרות, knives, probably used along with the snuffers for the cleansing
and trimming of the candlesticks and lamps, are not met with among the
utensils of the tabernacle, but are here mentioned (Chr. and Kings), and
in [Kg2 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#014.md) and [Jer
52:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#018.md), among the temple utensils.
Along with the מזרקות, sacrificial vessels (see on [Ch2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#008).md), in [Ch1
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#017.md) מזלנות, forks of gold, are also
mentioned, which are not elsewhere spoken of. Among the utensils of the
tabernacle we find only מזלגות of brass, flesh-forks, as an appurtenance
of the altar of burnt-offering ([Exo
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003.md); [Exo
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#003.md); [Num
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#014.md); cf. [Sa1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013)..md), which, however, cannot be
intended here, because all the utensils here enumerated belonged to the
holy place. What purpose the golden forks served cannot be determined,
but the mention of golden knives might lead us to presuppose that there
would be golden forks as well. That the forks are not mentioned in our
verse does not render their existence doubtful, for the enumeration is
not complete: e.g., the ספּות, [Kg1
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050.md), are also omitted. כּפּות,
vessels for the incense, and מחתּות, extinguishers, as in [Kg1
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050.md). Instead of דּלתותיו הבּית וּפּתח
הבּית , "and as regards the opening (door) of the house, its
door-leaves," in [Kg1 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050.md) we have
הבּית לדלתות והפּתת, "and the hinges of the door-leaves of the house."
This suggests that פתח is only an orthographical error for פּתת; but
then if we take it to be so, we must alter דּלתותיו into לדלתותיו. And,
moreover, the expression הבּית פּתת, door-hinges of the house, is
strange, as פּות properly denotes a recess or space between, and which
renders the above-mentioned conjecture improbable. The author of the
Chronicle seems rather himself to have generalized the expression, and
emphasizes merely the fact that even the leaves of the doors in the most
holy place and on the holy place were of gold; - of course not of solid
gold; but they were, as we learn from [Ch2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#007.md), overlaid with gold. This
interpretation is favoured by the simple זהב being used without the
predicate סגוּר. To the sing. פּתח no objection can be made, for the
word in its fundamental signification, "opening," may easily be taken
collectively.
