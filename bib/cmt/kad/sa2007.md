David's Resolution to Build a Temple. The Promised Perpetuity of His
Throne - 2 Samuel 7

To the erection of a sanctuary for the ark upon Mount Zion there is
appended an account of David's desire to build a temple for the Lord. We
find this not only in the text before us, but also in the parallel
history in 1 Chron 17. When David had acquired rest from his enemies
round about, he formed the resolution to build a house for the Lord, and
this resolution was sanctioned by the prophet Nathan ([Sa2
7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001).md). But the Lord revealed to the
prophet, and through him to David, that He had not required the building
of a temple from any of the tribes of Israel, and that He would first of
all build a house himself for His servant David, and confirm the throne
to his seed for ever, and then he should build Him a temple ([Sa2
7:4-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004).md). David then gave utterance to
his thanksgiving for this glorious promise in a prayer, in which he
praised the unmeasurable grace of God, and prayed for the fulfilment of
this renewed promised of divine grace ([Sa2
7:18-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018).md).

(Note: With regard to the historical authenticity of this promise,
Tholuck observes, in his Prophets and their Prophecies (pp. 165-6), that
"it can be proved, with all the evidence which is ever to be obtained in
support of historical testimony, that David actually received a
prophetic promise that his family should sit upon the throne for ever,
and consequently an intimation of a royal descendant whose government
should be eternal. Anything like a merely subjective promise arising
from human combinations is precluded here by the fact that Nathan,
acting according to the best of his knowledge, gave his consent to
David's plan of building a temple; and that it was not till afterwards,
when he had been instructed by a divine vision, that he did the very
opposite, and assured him on the contrary that God would build him a
house." Thenius also affirms that "there is no reason for assuming, as
De Wette has done, that Nathan's prophecies were not composed till after
the time of Solomon;" that "their historical credibility is attested by
Ps 89 ([Psa 89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004.md), [Psa
89:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#005.md), 20-38, and especially [Psa
89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020).md), [Psa
132:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md), and [Isa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md); and that, properly interpreted,
they are also Messianic." The principal evidence of this is to be found
in the prophetic utterance of David in 2 Samuel 23, where, as is
generally admitted, he takes a retrospective glance at the promise, and
thereby attests the historical credibility of Nathan's prophecy
(Thenius, p. 245). Nevertheless, Gust. Baur maintains that "a closer
comparison of this more elaborate and simple description (2 Samuel 7)
with the brief and altogether unexampled last words of David, more
especially with [Sa2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005.md), can hardly
leave the slightest doubt, that the relation in which the chapter before
us stands to these words, is that of a later expansion to an authentic
prophetic utterance of the king himself." For example, the distinct
allusion to the birth of Solomon, and the building of the temple, which
was to be completed by him, is said to have evidently sprung from a
later development of the original promise after the time of Solomon, on
account of the incongruity apparent in Nathan's prediction between the
ideal picture of the Israelitish monarchy and the definite allusion to
Solomon's building of the temple. But there is no such "incongruity" in
Nathan's prediction; it is only to be found in the naturalistic
assumptions of Baur himself, that the utterances of the prophets
contained nothing more than subjective and ideal hopes of the future,
and not supernatural predictions. This also applies to Diestel's
opinion, that the section [Sa2 7:4-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004.md)
does not harmonize with the substance of David's glorious prayer in [Sa2
7:18-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018.md), nor the latter again with
itself, because the advice given him to relinquish the idea of building
the temple is not supported by any reasons that answer either to the
character of David or to his peculiar circumstances, with which the
allusion to his son would have been in perfect keeping; but the
prophet's dissuasion merely alludes to the fact that Jehovah did not
stand in need of a stately house at all, and had never given utterance
to any such desire. On account of this "obvious" fact, Diestel regards
it as credible that the original dissuasion came from God, because it
was founded upon an earlier view, but that the promise of the son of
David which followed proceeded from Nathan, who no doubt looked with
more favourable eyes upon the building of the temple. This discrepancy
is also arbitrarily foisted upon the text. There is not a syllable about
any "original dissuasion" in all that Nathan says; for he simply tells
the king that Jehovah had hitherto dwelt in a tent, and had not asked
any of the tribes of Israel to build a stately temple, but not that
Jehovah did not need a stately house at all.)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 7:1</span></span>

[Sa2 7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md)

When David was dwelling in his house, i.e., the palace of cedar ([Sa2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011).md), and Jehovah had given him rest
from all his enemies round about, he said to Nathan the prophet: "See
now, I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of God dwelleth within the
curtains." היריעה in the singular is used, In [Exo
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#002.md)., to denote the inner covering,
composed of a number of lengths of tapestry sewn together, which was
spread over the planks of the tabernacle, and made it into a dwelling,
whereas the separate pieces of tapestry are called יריעת in the plural;
and hence, in the later writers, יריעות alternates sometimes with אהל
([Isa 54:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002).md), and at other times with
אהלים ([Sol 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md); [Jer
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md); [Jer
49:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#029).md). Consequently היריעה refers
here to the tent-cloth or tent formed of pieces of tapestry. "Within
(i.e., surrounded by) the tent-cloth:" in the Chronicles we find "under
curtains." From the words "when the Lord had given him rest from all his
enemies round about," it is evident that David did not form the
resolution to build the temple in the first years of his reign upon
Zion, nor immediately after the completion of his palace, but at a later
period (see the remarks on [Sa2 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011.md),
note). It is true that the giving of rest from all his enemies round
about does not definitely presuppose the termination of all the greater
wars of David, since it is not affirmed that this rest was a definitive
one; but the words cannot possibly be restricted to the two victories
over the Philistines ([Sa2 5:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017).md),
as Hengstenberg supposes, inasmuch as, however important the second may
have been, their foes were not even permanently quieted by them, to say
nothing of their being entirely subdued. Moreover, in the promise
mentioned in [Sa2 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#009.md), God distinctly
says, "I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all
thine enemies before thee." These words also show that at that time
David had already fought against all the enemies round about, and
humbled them. Now, as all David's principal wars are grouped together
for the first time in 2 Samuel 8 and 10, there can be no doubt that the
history is not arranged in a strictly chronological order. And the
expression "after this" in [Sa2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md) is
by no means at variance with this, since this formula does not at all
express a strictly chronological sequence. From the words of the
prophet, "Go, do all that is in thy heart, for the Lord is with thee,"
it is very evident that David had expressed the intention to build a
splendid palatial temple. The word לך, go (equivalent to "quite right"),
is omitted in the Chronicles as superfluous. Nathan sanctioned the
king's resolution "from his own feelings, and not by divine revelation"
(J. H. Michaelis); but he did not "afterwards perceive that the time for
carrying out this intention had not yet come," as Thenius and Bertheau
maintain; on the contrary, the Lord God revealed to the prophet that
David was not to carry out his intention at all.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 7:4</span></span>

The revelation and promise of God. - [Sa2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004.md). "That night," i.e., the night
succeeding the day on which Nathan had talked with the king concerning
the building of the temple, the Lord made known His decree to the
prophet, with instructions to communicate it to the king. וגו האתּה,
"Shouldest thou build me a house for me to dwell in?" The question
involves a negative reply, and consequently in the Chronicles we find
"thou shalt not."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 7:6</span></span>

The reason assigned for this answer: "I have not dwelt in a house from
the day of the bringing up of Israel out of Egypt even to this day, but
I was wandering about in a tent and in a dwelling." "And in a dwelling"
(mishcan) is to be taken as explanatory, viz., in a tent which was my
dwelling. As a tent is a traveller's dwelling, so, as long as God's
dwelling was a tent, He himself appeared as if travelling or going from
place to place. "In the whole of the time that I walked among all the
children of Israel, ... have I spoken a word to one of the tribes of
Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Wherefore have ye
not built me a cedar house?" A "cedar house" is equivalent to a palace
built of costly materials. The expression ישׂראל שׁבטי אחד ("one of the
tribes of Israel") is a striking one, as the feeding of the nation does
not appear to be a duty belonging to the "tribes," and in the Chronicles
we have שׁפטי (judges) instead of שׁבטי (tribes). But if שׁפטי had been
the original expression used in the text, it would be impossible to
explain the origin and general acceptance of the word שׁבטי. For this
very reason, therefore, we must regard שׁבטי as the original word, and
understand it as referring to the tribes, which had supplied the nation
with judges and leaders before the tie of David, since the feeding,
i.e., the government of Israel, which was in the hands of the judges,
was transferred to the tribes to which the judges belonged. This view is
confirmed by [Psa 78:67-68](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067.md), where the
election of David as prince, and of Zion as the site of the sanctuary,
is described as the election of the tribe of Judah and the rejection of
the tribe of Ephraim. On the other hand, the assumption of Thenius, that
שׁבטי, "shepherd-staffs," is used poetically for shepherds, cannot be
established on the ground of [Lev
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032.md) and [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md). Jehovah gave two reasons why
David's proposal to build Him a temple should not be carried out: (1) He
had hitherto lived in a tent in the midst of His people; (2) He had not
commanded any former prince or tribe to build a temple. This did not
involve any blame, as though there had been something presumptuous in
David's proposal, or in the fact that he had thought of undertaking such
a work without an express command from God, but simply showed that it
was not because of any negligence on the part of the former leaders of
the people that they had not thought of erecting a temple, and that even
now the time for carrying out such a work as that had not yet come.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 7:8</span></span>

After thus declining his proposal, the Lord made known His gracious
purpose to David: "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts" (not only Jehovah, as in
[Sa2 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#005.md), but Jehovah Sebaoth, because
He manifests himself in the following revelation as the God of the
universe): "I have taken thee from the pasturage (grass-plat), behind
the flock, to be prince over my people Israel; and was with thee
whithersoever thou wentest, and exterminated all thine enemies before
thee, and so made thee, ועשׂיתי (perfect with vav consec.), a great
name, ... and created a place for my people Israel, and planted them, so
that they dwell in their place, and do not tremble any more (before
their oppressors); and the sons of wickedness do not oppress them any
further, as at the beginning, and from the day when I appointed judges
over my people Israel: and I create thee rest from all thine enemies.
And Jehovah proclaims to thee, that Jehovah will make thee a house." The
words ישׂ עמּי ... היּום למן are to be joined to בּראשׁונה, "as in the
beginning," i.e., in Egypt, and from the time of the judges; that is to
say, during the rule of the judges, when the surrounding nations
constantly oppressed and subjugated Israel. The plan usually adopted, of
connecting the words with והניחתי, does not yield any suitable thought
at all, as God had not given David rest from the very beginning of the
times of the judges; but the period of the judges was long antecedent to
the time of David, and was not a period of rest for the Israelites.
Again, והניחתי does not resume what is stated in [Sa2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#009.md), and is not to be rendered as a
preterite in the sense of "I have procured thee rest," but as a perfect
with vav consec., "and I procure thee rest" from what is now about to
come to pass. And והגּיד is to be taken in the same way: the Lord shows
thee, first of all through His promise (which follows), and then through
the fact itself, the realization of His word. והניחתי refers to the
future, as well as the building of David's house, and therefore not to
the rest from all his enemies, which God had already secured for David,
but to that which He would still further secure for him, that is to say,
to the maintenance and establishment of that rest. The commentary upon
this is to be found in [Psa 89:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#022.md).
In the Chronicles ([Ch1 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#010).md) there
is a somewhat different turn given to the last clauses: "and I bend down
all thine enemies, and make it (the bending-down) known to thee (by the
fact), and a house will Jehovah build for thee." The thought is not
essentially changed by this; consequently there is no ground for any
emendation of the text, which is not even apparently necessary, unless,
like Bertheau, we misinterpret the words, and connect והכנעתּי
erroneously with the previous clause.

[Sa2 7:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008.md)

The connection between [Sa2 7:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#005.md) and
[Sa2 7:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008.md) has been correctly
indicated by Thenius as follows: Thou shalt not build a house for Me;
but I, who have from the very beginning glorified myself in thee and my
people ([Sa2 7:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008).md), will build a
house for thee; and thy son shall erect a house for me ([Sa2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013).md). This thought is not merely "a
play upon words entirely in the spirit of prophecy," but contains the
deep general truth that God must first of all build a man's house,
before the man can build God's house, and applies it especially to the
kingdom of God in Israel. As long as the quiet and full possession of
the land of Canaan, which had been promised by the Lord to the people of
God for their inheritance, was disputed by their enemies round about,
even the dwelling-place of their God could not assume any other form
than that of a wanderer's tent. The kingdom of God in Israel first
acquired its rest and consolation through the efforts of David, when God
had made all his foes subject to him and established his throne firmly,
i.e., had assured to his descendants the possession of the kingdom for
all future time. And it was this which ushered in the time for the
building of a stationary house as a dwelling for the name of the Lord,
i.e., for the visible manifestation of the presence of God in the midst
of His people. The conquest of the citadel of Zion and the elevation of
this fortress into the palace of the king, whom the Lord had given to
His people, formed the commencement of the establishment of the kingdom
of God. But this commencement received its first pledge of perpetuity
from the divine assurance that the throne of David should be established
for all future time. And this the Lord was about to accomplish: He would
build David a house, and then his seed should build the house of the
Lord. No definite reason is assigned why David himself was not to build
the temple. We learn this first of all from David's last words ([Ch1
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#003).md), in which he says to the
assembled heads of the nation, "God said to me, Thou shalt not build a
house for my name, because thou art a man of wars, and hast shed blood."
Compare with this the similar words of David to Solomon in [Ch1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#008.md), and Solomon's statement in his
message to Hiram, that David had been prevented from building the temple
in consequence of his many wars. It was probably not till afterwards
that David was informed by Nathan what the true reason was. As
Hengstenberg has correctly observed, the fact that David was not
permitted to build the temple on account of his own personal
unworthiness, did not involve any blame for what he had done; for David
stood in a closer relation to the Lord than Solomon did, and the wars
which he waged were wars of the Lord ([Sa1
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#028).md) for the maintenance and defence
of the kingdom of God. But inasmuch as these wars were necessary and
inevitable, they were practical proofs that David's kingdom and
government were not yet established, and therefore that the time for the
building of the temple had not yet come, and the rest of peace was not
yet secured. The temple, as the symbolical representation of the kingdom
of God, as also to correspond to the nature of that kingdom, and shadow
forth the peace of the kingdom of God. For this reason, David, the man
of war, was not to build the temple; but that was to be reserved for
Solomon, the man of peace, the type of the Prince of Peace ([Isa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005).md).

[Sa2 7:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md)

In [Sa2 7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md) there follows a more
precise definition of the way in which the Lord would build a house for
His servant David: "When thy days shall become full, and thou shalt lie
with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall come from
thy body, and establish his kingdom. He will build a house for my name,
and I shall establish the throne of his kingdom for ever." הקים, to set
up i.e., to promote to royal dignity. יצא אשׁר is not to be altered into
יצא אשׁר, as Thenius and others maintain. The assumption that Solomon
had already been born, is an unfounded one (see the note to [Sa2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011).md); and it by no means follows from
the statement in [Sa2 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md), to the
effect that God had given David rest from all his enemies, that his
resolution to build a temple was not formed till the closing years of
his reign.

[Sa2 7:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md)

"I will be a father to him, and he will be a son to me; so that if he go
astray, I shall chastise him with rods of men, and with strokes of the
children of men (i.e., not 'with moderate punishment, such as parents
are accustomed to inflict,' as Clericus explains it, but with such
punishments as are inflicted upon all men who go astray, and from which
even the seed of David is not to be excepted). But my mercy shall not
depart from him, as I caused it to depart from Saul, whom I put away
before thee. And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
before thee; thy throne shall be established for ever." It is very
obvious, from all the separate details of this promise, that it related
primarily to Solomon, and had a certain fulfilment in him and his reign.
On the death of David, his son Solomon ascended the throne, and God
defended his kingdom against the machinations of Adonijah ([Kg1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#012).md); so that Solomon was able to
say, "The Lord hath fulfilled His word that He spoke; for I have risen
up in the stead of my father David," etc. ([Kg1
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#020).md). Solomon built the temple, as
the Lord said to David ([Kg1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md); [Kg1
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#015)..md). But in his old age Solomon
sinned against the Lord by falling into idolatry; and as a punishment
for this, after his death his kingdom was rent from his son, not indeed
entirely, as one portion was still preserved to the family for David's
sake ([Kg1 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#009)..md). Thus the Lord
punished him with rods of men, but did not withdraw from him His grace.
At the same time, however unmistakeable the allusions to Solomon are,
the substance of the promise is not fully exhausted in him. The
threefold repetition of the expression "for ever," the establishment of
the kingdom and throne of David for ever, points incontrovertibly beyond
the time of Solomon, and to the eternal continuance of the seed of
David. The word seed denotes the posterity of a person, which may
consist either in one son or in several children, or in a long line of
successive generations. The idea of a number of persons living at the
same time, is here precluded by the context of the promise, as only one
of David's successors could sit upon the throne at a time. On the other
hand, the idea of a number of descendants following one another, is
evidently contained in the promise, that God would not withdraw His
favour from the seed, even if it went astray, as He had done from Saul,
since this implies that even in that case the throne should be
transmitted from father to son. There is still more, however, involved
in the expression "for ever." When the promise was given that the throne
of the kingdom of David should continue "to eternity," an eternal
duration was also promised to the seed that should occupy this throne,
just as in [Sa2 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md) the house and
kingdom of David are spoken of as existing for ever, side by side. We
must not reduce the idea of eternity to the popular notion of a long
incalculable period, but must take it in an absolute sense, as the
promise is evidently understood in [Psa
89:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030.md) : "I set his seed for ever, and
this throne as the days of heaven." No earthly kingdom, and no posterity
of any single man, has eternal duration like the heaven and the earth;
but the different families of men become extinct, as the different
earthly kingdoms perish, and other families and kingdoms take their
place. The posterity of David, therefore, could only last for ever by
running out in a person who lives for ever, i.e., by culminating in the
Messiah, who lives for ever, and of whose kingdom there is no end. The
promise consequently refers to the posterity of David, commencing with
Solomon and closing with Christ: so that by the "seed" we are not to
understand Solomon alone, with the kings who succeeded him, nor Christ
alone, to the exclusion of Solomon and the earthly kings of the family
of David; nor is the allusion to Solomon and Christ to be regarded as a
double allusion to two different objects.

But if this is established, - namely, that the promise given to the seed
of David that his kingdom should endure for ever only attained its
ultimate fulfilment in Christ, - we must not restrict the building of
the house of God to the erection of Solomon's temple. "The building of
the house of the Lord goes hand in hand with the eternity of the
kingdom" (Hengstenberg). As the kingdom endures for ever, so the house
built for the dwelling-place of the Lord must also endure for ever, as
Solomon said at the dedication of the temple ([Kg1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#013).md): "I have surely built Thee an
house to dwell in, a settled place for Thee to abide in for ever." The
everlasting continuance of Solomon's temple must not be reduced,
however, to the simple fact, that even if the temple of Solomon should
be destroyed, a new building would be erected in its place by the
earthly descendants of Solomon, although this is also implied in the
words, and the temple of Zerubbabel is included as the restoration of
that of Solomon. For it is not merely in its earthly form, as a building
of wood and stone, that the temple is referred to, but also and chiefly
in its essential characteristic, as the place of the manifestation and
presence of God in the midst of His people. The earthly form is
perishable, the essence eternal. This essence was the dwelling of God in
the midst of His people, which did not cease with the destruction of the
temple at Jerusalem, but culminated in the appearance of Jesus Christ,
in whom Jehovah came to His people, and, as God the Word, made human
nature His dwelling-place (ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν ἡμῖν, [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md) in the glory of the
only-begotten Son of the Father; so that Christ could say to the Jews,
"Destroy this temple (i.e., the temple of His body), and in three days I
will build it up again" ([Joh 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019).md).
It is with this building up of the temple destroyed by the Jews, through
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, that the complete and
essential fulfilment of our promise begins. It is perpetuated with the
Christian church in the indwelling of the Father and Son through the
Holy Ghost in the hearts of believers ([Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md); [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019).md), by which the church of Jesus
Christ is built up a spiritual house of God, composed of living stones
([Ti1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md); compare [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016.md); [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006).md); and it will be perfected in the
completion of the kingdom of God at the end of time in the new
Jerusalem, which shall come down upon the new earth out of heaven from
God, as the true tabernacle of God with men ([Rev
21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001).md).

As the building of the house of God receives its fulfilment first of all
through Christ, so the promise, "I will be to him a father, and he shall
be to me a son," is first fully realized in Jesus Christ, the
only-begotten Son of the heavenly Father (vid., [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005).md). In the Old Testament the
relation between father and son denotes the deepest intimacy of love;
and love is perfected in unity of nature, in the communication to the
son of all that the father hath. The Father loveth the Son, and hath
given all things into His hand ([Joh
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035).md). Sonship therefore includes the
government of the world. This not only applied to Christ, the
only-begotten Son of God, but also to the seed of David generally, so
far as they truly attained to the relation of children of God. So long
as Solomon walked in the ways of the Lord, he ruled over all the
kingdoms from the river (Euphrates) to the border of Egypt ([Kg1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001).md); but when his heart turned away
from the Lord in his old age, adversaries rose up against him ([Kg1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014.md)., [Kg1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023)..md), and after his death the
greater part of the kingdom was rent from his son. The seed of David was
chastised for its sins; and as its apostasy continued, it was humbled
yet more and more, until the earthly throne of David became extinct.
Nevertheless the Lord did not cause His mercy to depart from him. When
the house of David had fallen into decay, Jesus Christ was born of the
seed of David according to the flesh, to raise up the throne of His
father David again, and to reign for ever as King over the house of
Jacob ([Luk 1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032).md), and to establish
the house and kingdom of David for ever. - In [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md), where the promise returns to
David again with the words, "thy house and thy kingdom shall be
established for ever," the expression לפניך (before thee), which the lxx
and Syriac have arbitrarily changed into לפני (before me), should be
particularly observed. David, as the tribe-father and founder of the
line of kings, is regarded either "as seeing all his descendants pass
before him in a vision," as O. v. Gerlach supposes, or as continuing to
exist in his descendants.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 7:17</span></span>

"According to all these words ... did Nathan speak unto David," i.e., he
related the whole to David, just as God had addressed it to him in the
night. The clause in apposition, "according to all this vision," merely
introduces a more minute definition of the peculiar form of the
revelation. God spoke to Nathan in a vision which he had in the night,
i.e., not in a dream, but in a waking condition, and during the night;
for חזּיון = חזון is constantly distinguished from חלום, a revelation in
a dream.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 7:18</span></span>

David's prayer and thanksgiving. - [Sa2
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018.md). King David came, i.e., went into
the sanctuary erected upon Zion, and remained before Jehovah. ישׁב,
remained, tarried (as in [Gen 24:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#055.md);
[Gen 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#019), etc..md), not "sat;" for the
custom of sitting before the Lord in the sanctuary, as the posture
assumed in prayer, cannot be deduced from [Exo
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012.md), where Moses is compelled to sit
from simple exhaustion. David's prayer consists of two parts -
thanksgiving for the promise ([Sa2
7:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018).md), and supplication for its
fulfilment ([Sa2 7:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#025).md). The
thanksgiving consists of a confession of unworthiness of all the great
things that the Lord had hitherto done for him, and which He had still
further increased by this glorious promise ([Sa2
7:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018).md), and praise to the Lord that
all this had been done in proof of His true Deity, and to glorify His
name upon His chosen people Israel.

[Sa2 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018.md). "Who am I, O Lord Jehovah?
and who my house (i.e., my family), that Thou hast brought me hitherto?"
These words recall Jacob's prayer in [Gen
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010.md), "I am not worthy of the least
of all the mercies," etc. David acknowledged himself to be unworthy of
the great mercy which the Lord had displayed towards him, that he might
give the glory to God alone (vid., [Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md) and [Psa
144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003).md).

[Sa2 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#019.md)

"And this is still too little in Thine eyes, O Lord Jehovah, and Thou
still speakest with regard to the house of Thy servant for a great while
to come." למרחוק, lit. that which points to a remote period, i.e., that
of the eternal establishment of my house and throne. "And this is the
law of man, O Lord Jehovah." "The law of man" is the law which
determines ore regulates the conduct of man. Hence the meaning of these
words, which have been very differently interpreted, cannot, with the
context immediately preceding it, be any other than the following: This
- namely, the love and condescension manifested in Thy treatment of Thy
servant - is the law which applies to man, or is conformed to the law
which men are to observe towards men, i.e., to the law, Thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thyself ([Lev 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md),
compare [Mic 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008).md). With this
interpretation, which is confirmed by the parallel text of the
Chronicles (in [Sa2 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#017).md), "Thou
sawest (i.e., visitedst me, or didst deal with me) according to the
manner of man," that words are expressive of praise of the condescending
grace of the Lord. "When God the Lord, in His treatment of poor mortals,
follows the rule which He has laid down for the conduct of men one
towards another, when He shows himself kind and affectionate, this must
fill with adoring amazement those who know themselves and God"
(Hengstenberg). Luther is wrong in the rendering which he has adopted:
"This is the manner of a man, who is God the Lord;" for "Lord Jehovah"
is not an explanatory apposition to "man," but an address to God, as in
the preceding and following clause.

[Sa2 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#020.md)

"And what more shall David speak to Thee? Thou knowest Thy servant, Lord
Jehovah." Instead of expressing his gratitude still further in many
words, David appeals to the omniscience of God, before whom his thankful
heart lies open, just as in [Psa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md)
(compare also [Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003).md).

[Sa2 7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#021.md)

"For Thy word's sake, and according to Thy heart (and therefore not
because I am worthy of such grace), has Thou done all this greatness, to
make it known to Thy servant." The word, for the sake of which God had
done such great things for David, must be some former promise on the
part of God. Hengstenberg supposes it to refer to the word of the Lord
to Samuel, "Rise up and anoint him" ([Sa1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012).md), which is apparently favoured
indeed by the parallel in the corresponding text of [Ch1
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#019.md), "for Thy servant's sake," i.e.,
because Thou hast chosen Thy servant. But even this variation must
contain some special allusion which does not exclude a general
interpretation of the expression "for Thy word's sake," viz., an
allusion to the earlier promises of God, or the Messianic prophecies
generally, particularly the one concerning Judah in Jacob's blessing
([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md), and the one relating to
the ruler out of Jacob in Balaam's sayings ([Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017)..md), which contain the germs of
the promise of the everlasting continuance of David's government. For
the fact that David recognised the connection between the promise of God
communicated to him by Nathan and Jacob's prophecy in [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), is evident from [Ch1
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#004.md), where he refers to his election
as king as being the consequence of the election of Judah as ruler.
"According to Thine own heart" is equivalent to "according to Thy love
and grace; for God is gracious, merciful, and of great kindness and
truth" ([Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md), compare [Psa
103:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#008).md). גּדוּלה does not mean great
things, but greatness.

The praise of God commences in [Sa2
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#022.md) : "wherefore Thou art great,
Jehovah God; and there is not (one) like Thee, and no God beside Thee,
according to all that we have heard with our ears." By the word
"wherefore," i.e., because Thou hast done this, the praise of the
singleness of God is set forth as the result of David's own experience.
God is great when He manifests the greatness of His grace to men, and
brings them to acknowledge it. And in these great deeds He proves the
incomparable nature of His Deity, or that He alone is the true God. (For
the fact itself, compare [Exo 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md);
[Deu 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#024.md); [Deu
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#035)..md)

[Sa2 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#023.md)

"And where is (any) like Thy people, like Israel, a nation upon earth,
which God went to redeem as a people for himself, that He might make Him
a name, and do great things for you, and terrible things for Thy land
before Thy people, which Thou hast redeemed for Thee out of Egypt, (out
of the) nations and their gods?" מי does not really mean where, but who,
and is to be connected with the words immediately following, viz., אחד
גּוי (one nation); but the only way in which the words can be rendered
into good English (German in the original: Tr.) is, "where is there any
people," etc. The relative אשׁר does not belong to הלכוּ, "which Elohim
went to redeem." The construing of Elohim with a plural arises from the
fact, that in this clause it not only refers to the true God, but also
includes the idea of the gods of other nations. The idea, therefore, is
not, "Is there any nation upon earth to which the only true God went?"
but, "Is there any nation to which the deity worshipped by it went, as
the true God went to Israel to redeem it for His own people?" The
rendering given in the Septuagint to הלכוּ, viz., ὠδήγησεν, merely arose
from a misapprehension of the true sense of the words; and the
emendation הוליך, which some propose in consequence, would only distort
the sense. The stress laid upon the incomparable character of the things
which God had done for Israel, is merely introduced to praise and
celebrate the God who did this as the only true God. (For the thought
itself, compare the original passage in [Deu
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007.md), [Deu
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034)..md) In the clause לכם ולעשׂות, "and
to do for you," David addresses the people of Israel with oratorical
vivacity. Instead of saying "to do great things to (for) Israel," he
says "to do great things to (for you." For you forms an antithesis to
him, "to make Him a name, and to do great things for you (Israel)." The
suggestion made by some, that לכם is to be taken as a dativ. comm., and
referred to Elohim, no more needs a serious refutation than the
alteration into להם. There have been different opinions, however, as to
the object referred to in the suffix attached to לארצך, and it is
difficult to decide between them; for whilst the fact that לארצך נראות
(terrible things to Thy land) is governed by לעשׂות (to do) favours the
allusion to Israel, and the sudden transition from the plural to the
singular might be accounted for from the deep emotion of the person
speaking, the words which follow ("before Thy people") rather favour the
allusion to God, as it does not seem natural to take the suffix in two
different senses in the two objects which follow so closely the one upon
the other, viz., "for Thy land," and "before Thy people;" whilst the way
is prepared for a transition from speaking of God to speaking to God by
the word לכם (to you). The words of [Deu
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#021.md) floated before the mind of David
at the time, although he has given them a different turn. (On the
"terrible things," see the commentary on [Deu
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#021.md) and [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011)..md) The connection of נראות
(terrible things) with לארצך (to Thy land) shows that David had in mind,
when speaking of the acts of divine omnipotence which had inspired fear
and dread of the majesty of God, not only the miracles of God in Egypt,
but also the marvellous extermination of the Canaanites, whereby Israel
had been established in the possession of the promised land, and the
people of God placed in a condition to found a kingdom. These acts were
performed before Israel, before the nation, whom the Lord redeemed to
himself out of Egypt. This view is confirmed by the last words, "nations
and their gods," which are in apposition to "from Egypt," so that the
preposition מן should be repeated before גּוים (nations). The suffix to
ואלהיו (literally "and its gods") is to be regarded as distributive:
"the gods of each of these heathen nations." In the Chronicles ([Ch1
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#021).md) the expression is simplified,
and explained more clearly by the omission of "to Thy land," and the
insertion of לגרשׁ, "to drive out nations from before Thy people." It
has been erroneously inferred from this, that the text of our book is
corrupt, and ought to be emended, or at any rate interpreted according
to the Chronicles. But whilst לארצך is certainly not to be altered into
לגרשׁ, it is just as wrong to do as Hengstenberg proposes, - namely, to
take the thought expressed in לגרשׁ from the preceding לעשׂות by
assuming a zeugma; for עשׂה, to do or make, has nothing in common with
driving or clearing away.

[Sa2 7:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#024.md)

"And Thou hast established to thyself Thy people Israel to be a people
unto Thee for ever: and Thou, Jehovah, hast become a God to them." The
first clause does not refer merely to the liberation of Israel out of
Egypt, or to the conquest of Canaan alone, but to all that the Lord had
done for the establishment of Israel as the people of His possession,
from the time of Moses till His promise of the eternal continuance of
the throne of David. Jehovah had thereby become God to the nation of
Israel, i.e., had thereby attested and proved himself to be its God.

To this praise of the acts of the Lord there is attached in [Sa2
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#025.md). the prayer for the fulfilment of
His glorious promise. Would Jehovah set up (i.e., carry out) the word
which He had spoken to His servant that His name might be great, i.e.,
be glorified, through its being said, "The Lord of Sabaoth is God over
Israel," and "the house of Thy servant will be firm before Thee." The
prayer is expressed in the form of confident assurance.

[Sa2 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#027.md)

David felt himself encouraged to offer this prayer through the
revelation which he had received. Because God had promised to build him
a house, "therefore Thy servant hath found in his heart to pray this
prayer," i.e., hath found joy in doing so.

[Sa2 7:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#028.md)

David then briefly sums up the two parts of his prayer of thanksgiving
in the two clauses commencing with ועתּה, "and now." - In [Sa2
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#028.md) he sums up the contents of [Sa2
7:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018.md) by celebrating the greatness
of the Lord and His promise; and in [Sa2
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#029.md) the substance of the prayer in
[Sa2 7:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#025.md). וּברך הואל, may it
please Thee to bless (הואיל; see at [Deu
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#005)). "And from (out of.md) Thy blessing
may the house of Thy servant be blessed for ever."
