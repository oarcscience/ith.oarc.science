### [Proverbs Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 10:1</span></span>

In the introduction, chap. 1-9, there are larger sections of
interconnected thoughts having one common aim. Even in Prov 6:1-19 there
are manifestly three proverbial discourses distinguished from one
another, shorter indeed, yet containing one fundamental thought. Such
proverbs as are primarily designed to form one completed little whole of
themselves, are not here to be met with. On the contrary, the Solomonic
collection which now follows consists of pure distichs, for the most
part antithetical, but at the same time going over all the forms of the
technical proverb, as we have already shown; vid., p. 16. Accordingly
the exposition must from this point onward renounce reproduced
combinations of thought. The succession of proverbs here is nevertheless
not one that is purely accidental or without thought; it is more than a
happy accident when three of the same character stand together; the
collector has connected together proverb with proverb according to
certain common characteristics (Bertheau). And yet more than that: the
mass separates itself into groups, not merely succeeding one another,
but because a certain connection of ideas connects together a number of
proverbs, in such a way that the succession is broken, and a new point
of departure is arrived at (Hitzig). There is no comprehensive plan,
such as Oetinger in his summary view of its contents supposes; the
progressive unfolding follows no systematic scheme, but continuously
wells forth. But that the editor, whom we take also to be the arranger
of the contents of the book, did not throw them together by good chance,
but in placing them together was guided by certain reasons, the very
first proverb here shows, for it is chosen in conformity with the design
of this book, which is specially dedicated to youth:

1 A wise son maketh glad his father;

A foolish son is his mother's grief.

One sees here quite distinctly (cf. [Hos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013).md) that חכם (from חכם, properly to
be thick, stout, solid, as πυκνός = σοφός) is primarily a practical and
ethical conception. Similar proverbs are found further on, but
consisting of synonymous parallel members, in which either the father
both times represents the parents, as [Pro
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021.md); [Pro
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#024.md), or father and mother are
separated, each being named in different members, as [Pro
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#025.md); [Pro
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#025.md), and particularly [Pro
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#020.md), where 20a = 1a of the above
proverb. It is incorrect to say, with Hitzig, that this contrast draws
the division after it: the division lies nearer in the synonymous
distichs, and is there less liable to be misunderstood than in the
antithetic. Thus, from this proverb before us, it might be concluded
that grief on account of a befooled son going astray in bypaths, and not
coming to the right way, falls principally on the mother, as (Sir. 3:9)
is often the case in unfortunate marriages. The idea of the parents is
in this way only separated, and the two members stand in suppletive
interchangeable relationship. ישׂמּח is the middle of the clause, and is
the usual form in connection; ישׂמּח is the pausal form. תּוּגה, from
הוגה (יגה), has pass. , as תּורה, act. . "The expression of the pred. 1b
is like [Pro 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017.md); [Pro
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006.md); [Pro
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#014.md).; cf. e.g., Arab. âlastaḳṣa
furkat, oversharpening is dividing, i.e., effects it inquiries become or
lead to separation (cf. our proverb, Allzuscharf macht scharig = too
much sharpening makes full of notches); Burckhardt, Sprchw. Nr. 337"
(Fl.).

[Proverbs 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 10:2</span></span>

There follows now a series of proverbs which place possessions and goods
under a moral-religious point of view:

Treasures of wickedness bring no profit;

But righteousness delivers from death.

The lxx and Aquila translate ἀνόμους (ἀσεβεῖς). הועיל (to profit) with
the accus. is possible, [Isa 57:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#012.md),
but אוצרות one does not use by itself; it requires a genitive
designating it more closely. But also דּרשּׂיעא of the Targ., παρανόμων
of Symmachus, fails; for the question still remains, to whom? Rightly
Syr., Jerome, Theodotion, and the Quinta: ἀσεβείας, cf. [Pro
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#017.md); [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md); [Luk
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009.md), μαμωνᾶς τῆς ἀδικίας. Treasures
to which wickedness cleaves profit not, viz., him who has collected them
through wickedness. On the contrary, righteousness saves from death (2b
= [Pro 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004.md), where the parallelism
makes it clear that death as a judgment is meant). In [Deu
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#013.md) it had been already said that
compassionate love is "righteousness before the Lord," the cardinal
virtue of the righteousness of life. Faith ([Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004).md) is its soul, and love its life.
Therefore δικαιοσύνη and ἐεημοσύνη are interchangeable ideas; and it
ought not to be an objection against the Apocrypha that it repeats the
above proverb, ἐλεημοσύνη ἐκ θανάτου ῥύεται, Tob. 4:10; 12:9, Sir. 3:30;
29:12, for [Dan 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#024.md) also says the
very same thing, and the thought is biblical, in so far as the giving of
alms is understood to be not a dead work, but ([Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009).md) the life-activity of one who
fears God, and of a mind believing in Him and resting in His word.

[Proverbs 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 10:3</span></span>

Another proverb, the members of which stand in chiastic relation to
those of the preceding:

Jahve does not suffer the soul of the righteous to hunger;

But the craving of the godless He disappointeth.

The thought is the same as [Pro 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#025.md).
There, as also at [Pro 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030.md), the soul
is spoken of as the faculty of desire, and that after nourishment, for
the lowest form of the life of the soul is the impulse to
self-preservation. The parallel הוּה, in which lxx and Ar. erroneously
find the meaning of חיּה, life, the Syr. Targ. the meaning of הון,
possession, means the desire, without however being related to אוּה
(Berth.); it is the Arab. hawan, from הוה, Arab. haway, which, from the
fundamental meaning χαίνειν, hiare, to gape, yawn, signifies not only
unrestrained driving along, and crashing overthrow (cf. [Pro
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#006.md); [Pro
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013).md), but also the breaking forth,
ferri in aliquid, whence הוּה, Arab. hawan, violent desire, in Hebr.
generally (here and [Psa 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009.md), Mich.
[Pro 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#003).md) of desire without limits and
without restraint (cf. the plur. âhawâ, arbitrary actions, caprices);
the meanings deduced from this important verbal stem (of which also הוה
היה, accidere, and then esse, at least after the Arabic conception of
speech, is an offshoot) are given by Fleischer under [Job
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md), and after Fleischer by Eth,
Schlafgemach der Phantasie, ii. p. 6f. The verb הדף signifies to push in
the most manifold shades, here to push forth, repellere, as [Kg2
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#027.md) (cf. Arab. ḥadhaf, to push off =
to discharge); the fut. is invariably יהדּף, like יהגּה. God gives
satisfaction to the soul of the righteous, viz., in granting blessings.
The desire of the wicked He does not suffer to be accomplished; it may
appear for a long time as if that which was aimed at was realized, but
in the end God pushes it back, so that it remains at a distance, because
contrary to Him. Instead of והות רשׁעים, some editions (Plantin 1566,
Bragadin 1615) have והות בּגדים, but, in opposition to all decided
testimony, only through a mistaken reference to [Pro
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#006.md).

[Proverbs 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 10:4</span></span>

There follow two proverbs which say how one man fails and another
succeeds:

He becomes poor who bears a sluggish hand;

But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.

These three proverbs, [Pro 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#015.md); [Pro
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#024.md), [Pro
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#027.md), are similar. From the last two
it is seen that רמיּה is a subst., as also from [Psa
120:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002.md). (לשׁון רמיּה, from a crafty
tongue) that it is an adject., and from [Lev
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#015). (where כּף is fem..md) that it may
be at the same time an adject. here also. The masc. is רמי, like טרי to
טריּה ot , but neither of these occur; "the fundamental idea is that of
throwing oneself down lazily, when one with unbent muscles holds himself
no longer erect and stretched, Arab. taramy" (Fl.). The translation:
deceitful balances (Lwenstein after Rashi), is contrary to biblical
usage, which knows nothing of כף in this Mishnic meaning. But if כף is
here regarded as fem., then it cannot be the subject (Jerome, egestatem
operata est manus remissa), since we read עשׂה, not עשׂה. But ראשׁ also
is not suitable as the subject (lxx, Syr., Targ.), for poverty is called
רישׁ, רישׁ, ראשׁ; on the contrary, רשׁ, plur. רשׁים or ראשׁים, is used
adjectively. Since now the adject. רשׁ, [Sa1
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#014.md), is also written ראשׁ, it may be
translated: Poor is he who... (Bertheau); but we much rather expect the
statement of that which happens to such an one, thus: Poor will he be...
ראשׁ, 3 praet. = רשׁ, [Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md), with
the same (grammatically incorrect) full writing as קאם, [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md). In the conception of the
subject, כף־רמיה, after [Jer 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010.md), is
interpreted as the accus. of the manner (Berth.: whoever works with
sluggish hand); but since עשׂה רמיה (in another sense indeed: to
practise cunning) is a common phrase, [Psa
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#004.md); [Psa
101:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#007.md), so also will כף־רמיה be
regarded as the object: qui agit manum remissam, whoever carries or
moves such a hand (Hitzig). In 4b working is placed opposite to bearing:
the diligent hand makes rich, ditat or divitias parit; but not for
itself (Gesen. and others: becomes rich), but for him who bears it. The
diligent man is called חרוּץ, from חרץ, to sharpen, for, as in ὀξύς,
acer, sharpness is transferred to energy; the form is the same as
הלּוּק, smooth (for the ā is unchangeable, because recompensative), a
kindred form to קטול like חמוץ, and Arab. fâ'ûl as fashawsh, a boaster,
wind-bag, either of active (as חנּוּן) or (as חלוק, חרוץ, עמּוּד,
שׁכּוּל) of passive signification.

[Proverbs 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 10:5</span></span>

There is now added a proverb which, thus standing at the beginning of
the collection, and connecting itself with [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md), stamps on it the character of a
book for youth:

He that gathereth in summer is a wise son;

But he that is sunk in sleep in the time of harvest is a son that
causeth shame.

Von Hofmann (Schriftb. ii. 2. 403) rightly interprets בּן משׂכּיל and
בּן מבישׁ, with Cocceius and others, as the subject, and not with Hitzig
as predicate, for in nominal clauses the rule is to place the predicate
before the subject; and since an accurate expression of the inverted
relation would both times require הוא referring to the subject, so we
here abide by the usual syntax: he that gathers in summer time is...
Also the relation of the members of the sentence, [Pro
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026.md), is a parallel from which it is
evident that the misguided son is called מבישׁ as causing shame,
although in הבישׁ the idea to put to shame (= to act so that others are
ashamed) and to act shamefully (disgracefully), as in השׂכיל the ideas
to have insight and to act intelligently, lie into one another (cf. [Pro
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#035).md); the root-meaning of השׂכיל is
determined after שׂכל, which from שׂכל, complicare, designates the
intellect as the faculty of intellectual configuration. בּושׁ, properly
disturbari, proceeds from a similar conception as the Lat. confundi
(pudore). קיץ and קציר fall together, for קיץ (from קוץ = qât, to be
glowing hot) is just the time of the קציר; vid., under [Gen
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022.md). To the activity of a thoughtful
ingathering, אגר, for a future store (vid., [Pro
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#007).md), stands opposed deep sleep, i.e.,
the state of one sunk in idleness. נרדּם means, as Schultens has already
shown, somno penitus obrui, omni sensu obstructo et oppilato quasi, from
רדם, to fill, to shut up, to conclude; the derivation (which has been
adopted since Gesenius) from the Arab. word having the same sound, rdm,
stridere, to shrill, to rattle (but not stertere, to snore), lies remote
in the Niph., and also contradicts the usage of the word, according to
which it designates a state in which all free activity is bound, and all
reference to the external world is interrupted; cf. תּרדּמה, [Pro
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#015.md), of dulness, apathy, somnolency
in the train of slothfulness. The lxx has here one distich more than the
Hebr. text.

[Proverbs 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 10:6</span></span>

There now follow two proverbs regarding the blessings and the curses
which come to men, and which flow forth from them. Here, however, as
throughout, we take each proverb by itself, that it might not appear as
if we had a tetrastich before us. The first of these two antithetic
distichs is:

Blessings (come) on the head of the just;

But violence covereth the mouth of the godless.

Blessings are, without being distinguished, bestowed as well as prayed
for from above. Regarding the undistinguished uses of לראשׁ (of a
recompense of reward), בּראשׁ (of penal recompense), and על־ראשׁ
(especially of punishment), vid., under [Gen
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#026.md). If we understand, with Ewald,
Bertheau, Elster, Zckler, and others, the two lines after [Pro
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011.md), [Pro
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028.md), cf. [Pro
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#018.md) : the mouth of the wicked covers
(hides under a mask) violence, inasmuch as he speaks words of blessing
while thoughts of malediction lurk behind them ([Psa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005).md), then we renounce the sharpness
of the contrast. On the contrary, it is preserved if we interpret וּפי
as object: the violence that has gone out from it covereth the mouth of
the wicked, i.e., it falls back upon his foul mouth; or as Fleischer
(and Oetinger almost the same) paraphrases it: the deeds of violence
that have gone forth from them are given back to them in curses and
maledictions, so that going back they stop, as it were, their mouth,
they bring them to silence; for it is unnecessary to take פי
synecdochically for פני (cf. e.g., [Psa
69:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008).md), since in בּרכות 6a are perhaps
chiefly meant blessings of thankful acknowledgment on the part of men,
and the giving prominence to the mouth of the wicked from which nothing
good proceeds is well accounted for. The parallels do not hinder us thus
to explain, since parts of proverbs repeating themselves in the Book of
Proverbs often show a change of the meaning (vid., p. 24f.). Hitzig's
conjecture, יכּסה (better יכסּה), is unnecessary; for elsewhere we read,
as here, that חמס (violence), jure talionis, covers, יכּסּה, the wicked,
[Hab 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#017.md), or that he, using
"violence," therewith covers the whole of his external appearance, i.e.,
gives to it the branded impress of the unrighteousness he has done
(vid., Khler under [Mal 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#016).md).

[Proverbs 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 10:7</span></span>

Thus, as [Pro 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006.md) says how it goes
with the righteous and the wicked in this life, so this verse tells how
it fares with them after death:

The memory of the righteous remains in blessings,

And the name of the godless rots.

The tradition regarding the writing of זכר with five (זכר) or six points
(זכר) is doubtful (vid., Heidenheim in his ed. of the Pentateuch, Mer
Enajim, under [Exo 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014).md); the Cod.
1294 and old printed copies have here זכר. Instead of לברכה, יברך might
be used; the phrase היה לברכה (opp. היה לקללה, often used by Jeremiah),
subordinate to the substantival clause, paraphrases the passive, for it
expresses a growing to something, and thus the entrance into a state of
endurance. The remembrance of the righteous endures after his death, for
he is thought of with thankfulness (צל''ז = זכר צדיק לברכה, the usual
appendix to the name of an honoured, beloved man who has died), because
his works, rich in blessing, continue; the name of the godless, on the
contrary, far from continuing fresh and green ([Psa
62:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001) :17.md) after his departure,
becomes corrupt (רקב, from רק, to be or to become thin, to dissolve in
fine parts, tabescere), like a worm-eaten decayed tree ([Isa
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#020).md). The Talmud explains it thus,
Joma 38b: foulness comes over their name, so that we call no one after
their name. Also the idea suggests itself, that his name becomes
corrupt, as it were, with his bones; the Mishnah, at least Ohaloth ii.
1, uses רקב of the dust of corruption.

[Proverbs 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 10:8</span></span>

There follows now a series of proverbs in which reference to sins of the
mouth and their contrary prevails:

He that is wise in heart receives precepts;

But he that is of a foolish mouth comes to ruin.

A חכם־לב, wise-hearted, as one whose heart is חכם, [Pro
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#015.md); in a word, a נבון, a person of
understanding or judgment, [Pro 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#021.md).
Such an one does not make his own knowledge the ne plus ultra, nor does
he make his own will the noli me tangere; but he takes commands, i.e.,
instructions directing or prohibiting, to which he willingly
subordinates himself as the outflow of a higher knowledge and will, and
by which he sets bounds and limits to himself. But a fool of the lips,
i.e., a braggart blunderer, one pleasing himself with vain talk ([Pro
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#023).md), falls prostrate, for he thinks
that he knows all things better, and will take no pattern; but while he
boasts himself from on high, suddenly all at once - for he offends
against the fundamental principle of common life and of morality - he
comes to lie low down on the ground. The Syr. and Targ. translate ילּבט
by, he is caught (Bertheau, ensnared); Aquila, Vulgate, Luther,
δαρήσεται, he is slain; Symmachus, βασανισθήσεται; but all without any
support in the usage of the language known to us. Theodotion, φυρήσεται,
he is confounded, is not tenable; Joseph Kimchi, who after David Kimchi,
under [Hos 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014.md), appeals in support of
this meaning (ישׁתבשׁ, similarly Parchon: יתבלבל) to the Arabic, seems
to think on iltibâs, confusion. The demonstrable meanings of the verb
לבט are the following: 1. To occasion trouble. Thus Mechilta, under [Exo
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014.md), לבטוהו, one has imposed upon
him trouble; Sifri, under [Num 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001.md),
נתלבטנו, we are tired, according to which Rashi: he fatigues himself,
but which fits neither to the subj. nor to the contrast, which is to be
supposed. The same may be said of the meaning of the Syr. lbt, to drive
on, to press, which without doubt accords with the former meaning of the
word in the language of the Midrash. 2. In Arab. labaṭ (R. lab, vid.,
Wnsche's Hos. p. 172), to throw any one down to the earth, so that he
falls with his whole body his whole length; the passive נלבט, to be thus
thrown down by another, or to throw oneself thus down, figuratively of
one who falls hopelessly into evil and destruction (Fl.). The Arabic
verb is also used of the springing run of the animal ridden on (to
gallop), and of the being lame (to hop), according to which in the Lex.
the explanations, he hurries, or he wavers hither and thither, are
offered by Kimchi (Graec. Venet. πλανηθήσεται). But the former of these
explanations, corruit (= in calamitatem ruit), placed much nearer by the
Arabic, is confirmed by the lxx ὑποσκελισθήσεται, and by the Bershith
rabba, c. 52, where לבט is used in the sense to be ruined (= נכשׁל).
Hitzig changes the passive into the active: "he throws the offered לקח
scornfully to the ground," but the contrast does not require this. The
wanton, arrogant boasting lies already in the designation of the subj.
אויל שׂפתים; and the sequel involves, as a consequence, the contrasted
consequence of ready reception of the limitations and guidance of his
own will by a higher.

[Proverbs 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 10:9</span></span>

The form of this verse is like the eighth, word for word:

He that walketh in innocence walketh securely;

But he that goeth in secret ways is known.

The full form of בּתּום does not, as Hitzig supposes, stand in causal
connection with the Dech, for the consonant text lying before us is at
least 500 years older than the accentuation. For הלך תּם at [Pro
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007.md), there is here הלך בּתּום = הלך
בּדרך תום; so מעקּשׁ דּרכיו denotes, after [Pro
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015.md), such an one אשׁר דּרכיו עקּשׁים.
Expressed in the language of the N.T., תום is the property of the ἁπλοῦς
or ἀκέραιος, for the fundamental idea of fulness is here referred to
full submission, full integrity. Such an one goes בּטח (Aquila,
ἀμερίμνως), for there is nothing designedly concealed by him, of which
he has reason to fear that it will come to the light; whoever, on the
contrary, makes his ways crooked, i.e., turns into crooked ways, is
perceived, or, as we might also explain it (vid., under [Gen
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015)): if one (qui = si quis.md) makes
his ways crooked, then it is known - nothing, however, stands opposed to
the reference of יוּדע to the person: he is finally known, i.e.,
unmasked (lxx Jerome, γνωσθήσεται, manifestus fiet). Usually it is
explained: he is knowing, clever, with the remark that נודע is here the
passive of הודיע (Gesen., Ewald, Hitzig); Hiph. to give to feel; Niph.
to become to feel, properly to be made to know (Luth.: made wise); but
the passive of the Hiph. is the Hoph. Such a Niph. in which the
causative (not simply transitive) signification of the Hiph. would be
applied passively is without example (vid., Ewald, 133a); the meaning of
[Jer 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019.md) also is: after I have
become known, i.e., been made manifest, uncovered, drawn into the light.

[Proverbs 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 10:10</span></span>

This verse contains another proverb, similarly formed, parallel with the
half of [Pro 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008.md) :

He that winketh with the eye causeth trouble;

And a foolish mouth comes to ruin.

Regarding the winking or nipping, i.e., the repeated nipping of the eyes
(cf. nictare, frequent. of nicere), as the conduct of the malicious or
malignant, which aims at the derision or injury of him to whom it
refers, vid., under [Pro 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013.md); there
קרץ was connected with ב of the means of the action; here, as [Psa
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md), cf. [Pro
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#030.md), it is connected with the object
accus. He who so does produces trouble (heart-sorrow, [Pro
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013).md), whether it be that he who is
the butt of this mockery marks it, or that he is the victim of secretly
concerted injury; יתּן is not here used impersonally, as [Pro
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010.md), but as [Pro
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#015.md), cf. [Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028.md); [Lev
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#020.md), in the sense of the cause. 10b
forms a striking contrast to 10a, according to the text of the lxx: ὁ δὲ
ἐλεγχων μετὰ παῤῥησίας εἰρηνοποιεῖ, contrary to the Syr., by the Hebrew
text, which certainly is older than this its correction, which Ewald and
Lagarde unsuccessfully attempt to translate into the Hebrew. The foolish
mouth, here understood in conformity with 10a, is one who talks at
random, without examination and deliberation, and thus suddenly stumbles
and falls over, so that he comes to lie on the ground, to his own
disgrace and injury.

[Proverbs 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 10:11</span></span>

Another proverb, similar to the half of [Pro
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006.md) :

A fountain of life is the mouth of the righteous;

But the mouth of the godless hideth violence.

If we understand 11b wholly as 6b: os improborum obteget violentia, then
the meaning of 11a would be, that that which the righteous speaks tends
to his own welfare (Fl.). But since the words spoken are the means of
communication and of intercourse, one has to think of the water as
welling up in one, and flowing forth to another; and the meaning of 11b
has to accommodate itself to the preceding half proverb, whereby it
cannot be mistaken that חמס (violence), which was 6b subj., bears here,
by the contrast, the stamp of the obj.; for the possibility of manifold
windings and turnings is a characteristic of the Mashal. In the Psalms
and Prophets it is God who is called מקור חיּים, [Psa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010.md); [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md); [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md); the proverbial poetry plants
the figure on ethical ground, and understands by it a living power, from
which wholesome effects accrue to its possessor, [Pro
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027.md), and go forth from him to
others, [Pro 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014.md). Thus the mouth of
the righteous is here called a fountain of life, because that which he
speaks, and as he speaks it, is morally strengthening, intellectually
elevating, and inwardly quickening in its effect on the hearers; while,
on the contrary, the mouth of the godless covereth wrong (violentiam),
i.e., conceals with deceitful words the intention, directed not to that
which is best, but to the disadvantage and ruin of his neighbours; so
that words which in the one case bring to light a ground of life and of
love, and make it effectual, in the other case serve for a covering to
an immoral, malevolent background.

[Proverbs 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 10:12</span></span>

Another proverb of the different effects of hatred and of love:

Hate stirreth up strife,

And love covereth all transgressions.

Regarding מדנים, for which the Kerı̂ elsewhere substitutes מדינים, vid.,
under [Pro 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#014.md). Hatred of one's
neighbour, which is of itself an evil, has further this bad effect, that
it calls forth hatred, and thus stirreth up strife, feuds, factions, for
it incites man against man (cf. ערר, [Job
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008).md); on the contrary, love covers not
merely little errors, but also greater sins of every kind (כּל־פּשׁעים),
viz., by pardoning them, concealing them, excusing them, if possible,
with mitigating circumstances, or restraining them before they are
executed. All this lies in the covering. James, however, gives it, [Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020.md), another rendering: love covers
them, viz., from the eyes of a holy God; for it forgives them to the
erring brother, and turns him from the error of his way. The lxx
improperly translate πάντας δὲ τοὺς μὴ φιλονεικοῦντας κελόπτει φιλία;
but Peter ([Pe1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008).md) as well as James,
but none of the Greek versions; ἡ ἀγάπη καλύψει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν. The
Romish Church makes use of this passage as a proof for the introduction
of the fides formata, viz., caritate, in justification, which is
condemned in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession; and, indeed, the
multitudo peccatorum is not meant of the sins of him who cherishes love,
but of the sins of the neighbour. Sin stirs up hatred in men in their
relation to one another; but love covers the already existing sins, and
smooths the disturbances occasioned by them.

[Proverbs 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 10:13</span></span>

There follow now two other proverbs on the use and abuse of speech:

On the lips of the man of understanding wisdom is found;

And the rod for the back of the fool.

With Lwenstein, Hitzig, and others, it is inadmissible to regard ושׁבט
as a second subject to תּמּצא. The mouth itself, or the word of the
mouth, may be called a rod, viz., a rod of correction ([Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004).md); but that wisdom and such a rod
are found on the lips of the wise would be a combination and a figure in
bad taste. Thus 13b is a clause by itself, as Luther renders it: "but a
rod belongs to the fool's back;" and this will express a contrast to
13a, that while wisdom is to be sought for on the lips of the man of
understanding (cf. [Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).md), a man
devoid of understanding, on the contrary, gives himself to such hollow
and corrupt talk, that in order to educate him to something better, if
possible, the rod must be applied to his back; for, according to the
Talmudic proverb: that which a wise man gains by a hint, a fool only
obtains by a club. The rod is called שׁבט, from שׁבט, to be smooth, to
go straight down (as the hair of the head); and the back גּו, from גּוה,
to be rounded, i.e., concave or convex.

[Proverbs 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 10:14</span></span>

14 Wise men store up knowledge;

But the mouth of the fool is threatening destruction.

Ewald, Bertheau, Hitzig, Oetinger: "The mouth of the fool blunders out,
and is as the sudden falling in of a house which one cannot escape
from." But since מחתּה is a favourite Mishle-word to denote the effect
and issue of that which is dangerous and destructive, so the sense is
perhaps further to be extended: the mouth of the fool is for himself
([Pro 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#003).md) and others a near, i.e.,
an always threatening and unexpectedly occurring calamity; unexpectedly,
because suddenly he blunders out with his inconsiderate shame-bringing
talk, so that such a fool's mouth is to every one a praesens periculum.
As to יצפּנוּ, it is worthy of remark that in the Beduin, Arab. dfn,
fut. i, signifies to be still, to be thoughtful, to be absorbed in
oneself (vid., Wetstein on Job, p. 281). According to Codd. and
editions, in this correct, וּפי־ is to be written instead of אויל uwpiy;
vid., Baer's Torath Emeth, p. 40.

[Proverbs 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 10:15</span></span>

A pair of proverbs regarding possession and gain.

Regarding possession:

The rich man's wealth is his strong city;

The destruction of the poor is their poverty.

The first line = [Pro 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#011.md). One may
render the idea according to that which is internal, and according to
that which is external; and the proverb remains in both cases true. As
עז may mean, of itself alone, power, as means of protection, or a
bulwark ([Psa 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003).md), or the
consciousness of power, high feeling, pride ([Jdg
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021).md); so קרית עזּו may be rendered as
an object of self-confidence, and מחתּה, on the contrary, as an object
of terror ([Jer 48:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#039).md): the rich man,
to whom his estate (vid., on הון, p. 63) affords a sure reserve and an
abundant source of help, can appear confident and go forth
energetically; on the contrary, the poor man is timid and bashful, and
is easily dejected and discouraged. Thus e.g., Oetinger and Hitzig. But
the objective interpretation is allowable, and lies also much nearer:
the rich man stands thus independent, changes and adversities cannot so
easily overthrow him, he is also raised above many hazards and
temptations; on the contrary, the poor man is overthrown by little
misfortunes, and his despairing endeavours to save himself, when they
fail, ruin him completely, and perhaps make him at the same time a moral
outlaw. It is quite an experienced fact which this proverb expresses,
but one from which the double doctrine is easily derived: (1) That it is
not only advised, but also commanded, that man make the firm
establishing of his external life-position the aim of his endeavour; (2)
That one ought to treat with forbearance the humble man; and if he
always sinks deeper and deeper, one ought not to judge him with
unmerciful harshness and in proud self-exaltation.

[Proverbs 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 10:16</span></span>

Regarding gain:

The gain of the righteous tendeth to life;

The income of the godless to sin.

Intentionally, that which the righteous received is called פּעלּה (as
[Lev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#013).md), as a reward of his
labour; that which the godless receives is called תּבוּאה, as income
which does not need to be the reward of labour, and especially of his
own immediate labour. And with לחיּים, לחטּאת runs parallel, from the
supposition that sin carries the germ of death in itself. The reward of
his labour serves to the righteous to establish his life, i.e., to make
sure his life-position, and to elevate his life-happiness. On the
contrary, the income of the godless serves only to ruin his life; for,
made thereby full and confident, he adds sin to sin, whose wages is
death. Hitzig translates: for expiation, i.e., to lose it again as
atonement for past sins; but if חיים and חטאת are contrasted with each
other, then חטאת is death-bringing sin ([Pro
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#035)..md).

[Proverbs 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 10:17</span></span>

The group of proverbs now following bring again to view the good and bad
effects of human speech. The seventeenth verse introduces the
transition:

17 There is a way to life when one gives heed to correction;

And whoever disregards instruction runs into error.

Instead of ארח חיּים ([Pro 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006).md), there
is here ארח לחיים; and then this proverb falls into rank with [Pro
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#016.md), which contains the same word
לחיים. The accentuation denotes ארח as subst.; for ארח way, road = ארח
\[a wayfarer, part. of ארח\] would, as שׁסע, [Lev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#007.md), נטע, [Psa
94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009.md), have the tone on the ultima. It
is necessary neither to change the tone, nor, with Ewald, to interpret
ארח as abstr. pro concreto, like הלך, for the expression "wanderer to
life" has no support in the Mishle. Michaelis has given the right
interpretation: via ad vitam est si quis custodiat disciplinam. The
syntactical contents, however, are different, as e.g., [Sa1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013.md), where the participle has the
force of a hypothetical clause; for the expression: "a way to life is he
who observes correction," is equivalent to: he is on the way to life
who...; a variety of the manner of expression: "the porch was twenty
cubits," [Ch2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004.md), particularly
adapted to the figurative language of proverbial poetry, as if the poet
said: See there one observant of correction - that (viz., the שׁמר
\[שׁמר, to watch\] representing itself in this שׁמר) is the way to life.
מוּסר and תּוכחת are related to each other as παιδεία and ἔλεγχος; עזב
\[עזב, to leave, forsake\] is equivalent to בּלתּי שׁמר. מתעה would be
unsuitable as a contrast in the causative sense: who guides wrong,
according to which Bertheau understands 17a, that only he who observes
correction can guide others to life. We expect to hear what injuries he
who thinks to raise himself above all reproach brings on himself.
Hitzig, in his Commentary (1858), for this reason places the Hithpa.
מתּעה (rather write מתּעה) in the place of the Hiph.; but in the Comm.
on Jeremiah (1866), 42:20, he rightly remarks: "To err, not as an
involuntary condition, but as an arbitrary proceeding, is suitably
expressed by the Hiph." In like manner הוסיף, הגּיע (to touch), הרחיק
(to go to a distance), denote the active conduct of a being endowed with
reason; Ewald, 122, c. Jewish interpreters gloss מתעה by supplying
נפשׁו; but it signifies only as inwardly transitive, to accomplish the
action of the תּעות.

[Proverbs 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 10:18</span></span>

18 He that hideth hatred is a mouth of falsehood;

And he that spreadeth slander is a fool.

The lxx, καλύπτουσιν ἔχθραν χεῖλα δίκαια, which Ewald prefers, and which
has given occasion to Hitzig to make a remarkable conjecture ("He who
conceals hatred, close lips," which no one understands without Hitzig's
comment. to this his conjecture). But (1) to hide hatred (cf. [Pro
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011.md), [Pro
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#024).md) is something altogether
different from to cover sin ([Pro
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md), [Pro
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009).md), or generally to keep anything
secret with discretion ([Pro 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013).md);
and (2) that δίκαια is a corrupt reading for ἄδικα (as Grabe supposes,
and Symmachus translates) or δόλια (as Lagarde supposes, and indeed is
found in Codd.). Michaelis well remarks: odium tectum est dolosi,
manifesta sycophantia stultorum. Whoever conceals hateful feelings
behind his words is שׂפתי־שׂקר, a mouth of falsehood (cf. the mouth of
the fool, [Pro 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#014).md); one does not
need to supply אישׁ, but much rather has hence to conclude that a false
man is simply so named, as is proved by [Psa
120:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003.md). There is a second moral
judgment, 18b: he who spreadeth slander (וּמוצא, according to the
Masoretic writing: he who divulges it, the correlate to הביא, to bring
to, [Gen 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#002).md) is a Thor fool, stupid,
dull, כּסיל (not a Narr fool, godless person, אויל); for such slandering
can generally bring no advantage; it injures the reputation of him to
whom the דבּה, i.e., the secret report, the slander, refers; it sows
discord, has incalculable consequences, and finally brings guilt on the
tale-bearer himself.

[Proverbs 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 10:19</span></span>

19 In a multitude of words transgression is not wanting;

But he who restrains his lips shows wisdom.

We do not, with Bertheau, understand 19a: by many words a transgression
does not cease to be what it is; the contrast 19b requires a more
general condemnation of the multitude of words, and חדל not only means
to cease from doing (to leave off), and to cease from being (to take
away), but also not at all to do (to intermit, [Eze
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#011.md); [Zac
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012).md), and not at all to be (to fail,
to be absent), thus: ubi verborum est abundantia non deest peccatum
(Fl.). Michaelis suitably compares πολυλογία πολλὰ σφάλματα ἒχει by
Stobus, and כל המרבה דברים מביא חטא in the tractate Aboth i. 17,
wherewith Rashi explains the proverb. פּשׁע is not here, as elsewhere,
e.g., [Psa 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014.md), with special
reference to the sin of falling away from favour, apostasy, but, like
the post-biblical עברה, generally with reference to every kind of
violation (פשׁע = Arab. fsq dirumpere) of moral restraint; here, as
Jansen remarks, peccatum sive mendacii, sive detractionis, sive alterius
indiscretae laesionis, sive vanitatis, sive denique verbi otiosi. In 19b
it is more appropriate to regard משׂכּיל as the present of the internal
transitive (intelligenter agit) than to interpret it in the attributive
sense (intelligens).

[Proverbs 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 10:20</span></span>

20 Choice silver is the tongue of the righteous;

But the heart of the godless is little worth.

Choice silver is, as [Pro 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#019.md), cf.
10, pure, freed from all base mixtures. Like it, pure and noble, is
whatever the righteous speaks; the heart, i.e., the manner of thought
and feeling, of the godless is, on the contrary, like little instar
nihili, i.e., of little or no worth, Arab. yasway kâlyla (Fl.). lxx: the
heart of the godless ἐκλείψει, i.e., ימעט, at first arrogant and full of
lofty plans, it becomes always the more dejected, discouraged, empty.
But 20a leads us to expect some designation of its worth. The Targ.
(according to which the Peshito is to be corrected; vid., Levy's
Wrterbuch, ii. 26): the heart of the godless is מחתא (from נחת), refuse,
dross. The other Greek versions accord with the text before us.

[Proverbs 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 10:21</span></span>

21 The lips of the righteous edify many;

But fools die through want of understanding.

The lxx translate 21a: the lips of the righteous ἐπίσταται ὑψηλά, which
would at least require ידעו רבות. רעה is, like the post-bibl. pir

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

neec (vid., the Hebr. Rmerbrief, p. 97), another figure for the N.T.
οἰκοδομεῖν: to afford spiritual nourishment and strengthening, to which
Fleischer compares the ecclesiastical expressions: pastor, ovile
ecclesiae, les ouailles; רעה means leader, [Jer
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021.md), as well as teacher, [Ecc
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011.md), for it contains partly the
prevailing idea of leading, partly of feeding. ירעוּ stands for תּרעינה,
as [Pro 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#032.md), [Pro
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002.md). In 21b, Bertheau incorrectly
explains, as Euchel and Michaelis: stulti complures per dementem unum
moriuntur; the food has truly enough in his own folly, and needs not to
be first drawn by others into destruction. חסר is not here the
connective form of חסר (Jewish interpreters: for that reason, that he is
such an one), nor of חסר (Hitzig, Zckler), which denotes, as a concluded
idea, penuria, but like רחב, [Pro
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#004.md), שׁכב, [Pro
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010.md), and שׁפל, [Pro
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#019.md), infin.: they die by want of
understanding (cf. [Pro 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023).md); this
amentia is the cause of their death, for it leads fools to meet
destruction without their observing it ([Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006).md).

[Proverbs 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 10:22</span></span>

Three proverbs which say that good comes from above, and is as a second
nature to the man of understanding:

22 Jahve's blessing - it maketh rich;

And labour addeth nothing thereto

Like 24a, היא limits the predicate to this and no other subject: "all
depends on God's blessing." Here is the first half of the ora et labora.
The proverb is a compendium of [Psa
127:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md). 22b is to be understood,
according to [Psa 127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002.md) of this
Solomonic psalm, not that God adds to His blessing no sorrow, much
rather with the possession grants at the same time a joyful, peaceful
mind (lxx, Targ., Syriac, Jerome, Aben-Ezra, Michaelis, and others),
which would require the word עליה; but that trouble, labour, i.e.,
strenuous self-endeavours, add not (anything) to it, i.e., that it does
not associate itself with the blessing (which, as the Jewish
interpreters rightly remark, is, according to its nature, תוספת, as the
curse is חסרון) as the causa efficiens, or if we supply quidquam, as the
complement to עמּהּ along with it: nothing is added thereto, which goes
along with that which the blessing of God grants, and completes it. Thus
correctly Rashi, Luther, Ziegler, Ewald, Hitzig, Zckler. the now current
accentuation, לאו יוסף עצב עמּהּ, is incorrect. Older editions, as
Venice 1525, 1615, Basel 1618, have ולא־יוסף עצב עמה, the transformation
of ולא־יוסף עצב. Besides, עצב has double Segol (vid., Kimchi's Lex.),
and יוסף is written, according to the Masora, in the first syllable
plene, in the last defective.

[Proverbs 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 10:23</span></span>

23 Like sport to a fool is the commission of a crime;

And wisdom to a man of understanding.

Otherwise Lwenstein: to a fool the carrying out of a plan is as sport;
to the man of understanding, on the contrary, as wisdom. זמּה, from זמם,
to press together, mentally to think, as [Job
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#011.md), and according to Gesenius, also
[Pro 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#027.md); [Pro
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#009.md). But זמּה has the prevailing
signification of an outrage against morality, a sin of unchastity; and
especially the phrase עשׂה זמּה is in [Jdg
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#006.md) and in Ezekiel not otherwise
used, so that all the old interpreters render it here by patrare scelus;
only the Targum has the equivocal עבד עבידתּא; the Syriac, however, 'bd
bı̂\_taa'. Sinful conduct appears to the fool, who places himself above
the solemnity of the moral law, as sport; and wisdom, on the contrary,
(appears as sport) to a man of understanding. We would not venture on
this acceptation of כּשׂחוק if שׂחק were not attributed, [Pro
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030.md)., to wisdom itself. This
alternate relationship recommends itself by the indetermination of
חכמהו, which is not favourable to the interpretation: sed sapientiam
colit vir intelligens, or as Jerome has it: sapientia autem est viro
prudentia. The subjects of the antithesis chiastically combine within
the verse: חכמה, in contrast to wicked conduct, is acting in accordance
with moral principles. This to the man of understanding is as easy as
sporting, just as to the fool is shameless sinning; for he follows in
this an inner impulse, it brings to him joy, it is the element in which
he feels himself satisfied.

[Proverbs 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 10:24</span></span>

24 That of which the godless is afraid cometh upon him,

And what the righteous desires is granted to him.

The formation of the clause 24a is like the similar proverb, [Pro
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#027.md); the subject-idea has there its
expression in the genitival annexum, of which [Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md) furnishes the first example; in
this passage before us it stands at the beginning, and is, as in [Pro
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022.md), emphatically repeated with היא.
מגורה, properly the turning oneself away, hence shrinking back in
terror; here, as [Isa 66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004.md), of the
object of fear, parallel to תּאוה, wishing, of the object of the wish.
In 24b Ewald renders יתּן as adj. from יתן (whence איתן ecne), after the
form פּקּח, and translates: yet to the righteous desire is always green.
But whether יתּן is probably formed from יתן, and not from נתן, is a
question in [Pro 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#012.md), but not here,
where wishing and giving (fulfilling) are naturally correlata. Hitzig
corrects יתּן, and certainly the supplying of 'ה is as little
appropriate here as at [Pro 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#021.md).
Also a "one gives" is scarcely intended (according to which the Targ.,
Syr., and Jerome translate passively), in which case the Jewish
interpreters are wont to explain יתן, scil. הנותן; for if the poet
thought of יתן fo with a personal subject, why did he not rescue it from
the dimness of such vague generality? Thus, then, יתן is, with Bttcher,
to be interpreted as impersonal, like [Pro
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010.md); [Job
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#010.md), and perhaps also [Gen
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#028) (Ewald, 295a.md): what the
righteous wish, that there is, i.e., it becomes actual, is fulfilled. In
this we have not directly and exclusively to think of the destiny at
which the godless are afraid ([Heb
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027).md), and toward which the desire of
the righteous goes forth; but the clause has also truth which is
realized in this world: just that which they greatly fear, e.g.,
sickness, bankruptcy, the loss of reputation, comes upon the godless; on
the contrary that which the righteous wish realizes itself, because
their wish, in its intention, and kind, and content, stands in harmony
with the order of the moral world.

[Proverbs 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 10:25</span></span>

There now follows a series of proverbs, broken by only one dissimilar
proverb, on the immoveable continuance of the righteous:

25 When the storm sweeps past, it is no more with the wicked;

But the righteous is a building firm for ever.

How [Pro 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025.md) is connected with [Pro
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#024.md) is shown in the Book of Wisdom
5:15 (the hope of the wicked like chaff which the wind pursues). The
Aram., Jerome, and Graec. Venet. interpret כ of comparison, so that the
destruction of the godless is compared in suddenness and rapidity to the
rushing past of a storm; but then רוּח ought to have been used instead
of סוּפה; and instead of ואין רשׁע with the ו apodosis, a disturbing
element in such a comparison, would have been used יחלף רשׁע, or at
least רשׁע אין. The thought is no other than that of [Job
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#018.md) : the storm, which is called
סופה, from סוּף, to rush forth, is meant, as sweeping forth, and כ the
temporal, as [Exo 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md) (lxx
παραπορευομένης καταιγίδος), with ו htiw ,)עןה apod. following, like
e.g., after a similar member of a temporal sentence, [Isa
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#025.md). סופה is a figure of God-decreed
calamities, as war and pestilence, under which the godless sink, while
the righteous endure them; cf. with 25a, [Pro
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027.md); [Isa
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#018.md); and with 25b, [Isa
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#025.md), [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md); [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md). "An everlasting foundation,"
since עולם is understood as looking forwards, not as at [Isa
58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012.md), backwards, is a foundation
capable of being shaken by nothing, and synecdoch. generally a building.
The proverb reminds us of the close of the Sermon on the Mount, and
finds the final confirmation of its truth in this, that the death of the
godless is a penal thrusting of them away, but the death of the
righteous a lifting them up to their home. The righteous also often
enough perish in times of war and of pestilence; but the proverb, as it
is interpreted, verifies itself, even although not so as the poet,
viewing it from his narrow O.T. standpoint, understood it; for the
righteous, let him die when and how he may, is preserved, while the
godless perishes.

[Proverbs 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 10:26</span></span>

This proverb stands out of connection with the series:

As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,

So is the sluggard to them who gives him a commission.

A parabolic proverb (vid., p. 9), priamel-like in its formation (p. 13).
Here and there לשּׁנּים is found with Mugrash, but in correct texts it
has Reba-magnum; the verse is divided into two by Athnach, whose
subordinate distributive is (Accentssystem, xi. 1) Reba-magnum. Smoke
makes itself disagreeably perceptible to the sense of smell, and
particularly to the eyes, which it causes to smart so that they overflow
with tears; wherefore Virgil speaks of it as amarus, and Horace
lacrimosus. חמץ (from חמץ, to be sour, harsh) signifies properly that
which is sour, as acetum, ὄξος; here, after the lxx ὄμφαξ, the unripe
grapes, but which are called בּסר (בּסר) (vid., under [Job
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#033).md), by which the Syr., here
following the lxx, translates, and which also in the Talmud, Dema i. 1,
is named חמץ, after a doubtful meaning (vid., Aruch, and on the other
side Rashi), thus: vinegar, which the word commonly means, and which
also accords with the object of the comparison, especially if one thinks
of the sharp vinegar-wine of the south, which has an effect on the teeth
denoted by the Hebr. verb קהה, as the effect of smoke is by כהה (Fl.).
The plur. לשׁלחיו is that of the category, like [Pro
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#021.md); [Pro
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013.md); the parallel אדניו of the
latter passage does not at least make it necessary to regard it, like
this, as a plur. excellentiae (Bertheau, Hitzig, Ewald). They who send a
sluggard, i.e., who make him their agent, do it to their own sorrow; his
slothfulness is for them, and for that which they have in view, of dull,
i.e., slow and restrained, of biting, i.e., sensibly injurious
operation.

[Proverbs 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 10:27</span></span>

From this point the proverbs fall into the series connecting themselves
with [Pro 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025.md) :

27 The fear of Jahve multiplies the days of life;

But the years of the godless are shortened.

This parable, like [Pro 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025.md), also
corresponds with the O.T. standpoint, having in view the present life.
The present-life history confirms it, for vice destroys body and soul;
and the fear of God, which makes men contented and satisfied in God, is
truly the right principle of longevity. But otherwise also the pious
often enough die early, for God carries them away מפני הרעה from the
face of the evil, [Isa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md).; or if
they are martyrs for the truth ([Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md), cf. [Psa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006).md), the verification of the above
proverb in such cases moves forward (Wisd. 4:7ff.) into eternity, in
which the life of the pious continues for ever, while that of the
godless loses itself with his death in the state of everlasting death.
[Pro 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#011.md), cf. [Pro
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002.md), resembles 27a. Instead of
תּקצרנה, תקצרנה was to be expected; but the flexion does not distinguish
the transitive קצר (Arab. ḳaṣara) and intransitive קצר (Arab. ḳaṣura) as
it ought.

[Proverbs 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 10:28</span></span>

28 The expectation of the righteous is gladness

And the hope of the godless comes to nothing.

תּוחלת as well as תּקוה proceed on the fundamental idea of a strained
earnest looking back upon something, the same fundamental idea which in
another view gives the meaning of strength (חיל, Arab. ḥayl; ḳuwwat,
kawiyy, cf. גּדל, Arab. jdl, plectere, and גּדול, strong and strength).
The substantival clause 28a denotes nothing more than: it is gladness
(cf. [Pro 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017.md), all their steps are
gladness), but which is equivalent to, it is that in its issue, in
gaudium desinit. Hitzig's remark that תוחלת is the chief idea for hope
and fear, is not confirmed by the usage of the language; it always
signifies joyful, not anxious, expectation; cf. the interchange of the
same two synonyms [Pro 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#007.md), and
תּאות, [Psa 112:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#010.md), instead of תּקות
(here and [Job 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013).md). While the
expectation of the one terminates in the joy of the fulfilment, the hope
of the other (אבד, R. בד, to separate) perishes, i.e., comes to nothing.

[Proverbs 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 10:29</span></span>

29 Jahve's way is a bulwark to the righteous;

But ruin to those that do evil.

Of the two meanings which מעז (מעוז) has: a stronghold from עזז, and
asylum (= Arab. m'adz) from עוּז, the contrast here demands the former.
'דּרך ה and 'יראת ה, understood objectively, are the two O.T. names of
true religion. It means, then, the way which the God of revelation
directs men to walk in ([Psa 143:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#008).md),
the way of His precepts, [Psa 119:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#027.md),
His way of salvation, [Psa 67:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#003) (4.md);
in the N.T. ἡ ὁδὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ, [Mat
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016.md); [Act
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025.md).; cf. ἡ ὁδός simply, [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002.md); [Act
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014.md). This way of Jahve is a
fortress, bulwark, defence for innocence, or more precisely, a
disposition wholly, i.e., unreservedly and without concealment, directed
toward God and that which is good. All the old interpreters, also
Luther, but not the Graec. Venet., translate as if the expression were
לתּם; but the punctuation has preferred the abstr. pro concreto, perhaps
because the personal תּם nowhere else occurs with any such prefix; on
the contrary, תּם is frequently connected with ב, כ, ל. לתם דרך, integro
viae (vitae), are by no means to be connected in one conception
(Ziegler, Umbr., Elster), for then the poet ought to have written מעז
יהוה לתם־דרך. 29b cannot be interpreted as a thought by itself: and ruin
(vid., regarding מחתּה, ruina, and subjectively consternatio, [Pro
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#016).md) comes to those who do evil; but
the thought, much more comprehensive, that religion, which is for the
righteous a strong protection and safe retreat, will be an overthrow to
those who delight only in wickedness (vid., on און, p. 143), is
confirmed by the similarly formed distich, [Pro
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#015.md). Also almost all the Jewish
interpreters, from Rashi to Malbim, find here expressed the operation of
the divine revelation set over against the conduct of men - essentially
the same as when the Tora or the Chokma present to men for their choice
life and death; or the gospel of salvation, according to [Co2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md), is to one the savour of life
unto life, to another the savour of death unto death.

[Proverbs 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 10:30</span></span>

30 The righteous is never moved;

But the godless abide not in the land.

Love of home is an impulse and emotion natural to man; but to no people
was fatherland so greatly delighted in, to none was exile and banishment
from fatherland so dreadful a thought, as it was to the people of
Israel. Expatriation is the worst of all evils with which the prophets
threatened individuals and the people, [Amo
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#017.md), cf. [Isa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#017.md).; and the history of Israel in
their exile, which was a punishment of their national apostasy, confirms
this proverb and explains its form; cf. [Pro
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#021.md)., [Psa
37:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#029.md). בּל is, like [Pro
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#013.md), the emphatic No of the more
elevated style; נמוט, the opposite of נכון, [Pro
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#003.md); and שׁכן signifies to dwell,
both inchoative: to come to dwell, and consecutive: to continue to dwell
(e.g., [Isa 57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md), of God who
inhabiteth eternity). In general, the proverb means that the righteous
fearlessly maintains the position he takes; while, on the contrary, all
they who have no hold on God lose also their outward position. But often
enough this saying is fulfilled in this, that they, in order that they
may escape disgrace, became wanderers and fugitives, and are compelled
to conceal themselves among strangers.

[Proverbs 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 10:31</span></span>

For the third time the favourite theme already handled in three
appendixes is taken up:

The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom,

And the tongue of falsehood shall be rooted up.

Regarding the biblical comparison of thoughts with branches, and of
words with flowers and fruits, vid., my Psychol. p. 181; and regarding
the root נב (with its weaker אב), to swell up and to spring up (to well,
grow, etc.), vid., what is said in the Comm. on Genesis on נביא, and in
Isaiah on עוב. We use the word נוּב of that which sprouts or grows, and
נבב of that which causes that something sprout; but also נוב may, after
the manner of verbs of being full ([Pro
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010).md), of flowing (Gesen. 138, 1, Anm.
2), take the object accus. of that from which anything sprouts ([Pro
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#031).md), or which sprouting, it raises
up and brings forth (cf. [Isa 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019).md).
The mouth of the righteous sprouts, brings forth (in [Psa
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030.md), without a figure, יהגּה, i.e.,
utters) wisdom, which in all relations knows how to find out that which
is truly good, and suitable for the end intended, and happily to
unriddle difficult complications. The conception of wisdom, in itself
practical (from חכם, to be thick = solid, firm), here gains such
contents by the contrast: the tongue - whose character and fruit is
falsehood, which has its delight in intentional perversions of fact, and
thus increaseth complications (vid., regarding תּהפּכות, [Pro
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012).md) - is rooted up, whence it
follows as regards the mouth of the righteous, that it continues for
ever with that its wholesome fruit.

[Proverbs 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 10:32</span></span>

32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable;

But the mouth of the godless is mere falsehood.

Hitzig, instead of ידעוּן, reads יבּעוּן; the ἀποστάζει \[they distil or
send forth\] of the lxx does not favour this, for it is probably only a
corruption of ἐπίσταται, which is found in several MSS the Graec.
Venet., which translates ποιμανοῦσι, makes use of a MS which it
sometimes misreads. The text does not stand in need of any emendations,
but rather of a corrected relation between the clauses, for the relation
of 31a with 32b, and of 32a with 31b, strongly commends itself (Hitzig);
in that case the explanation lies near: the lips of the righteous find
what is acceptable, viz., to God. But this thought in the Mashal
language is otherwise expressed ([Pro
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002) and paral..md); and also 32a and 32b
fit each other as contrasts, if by רצון, as [Pro
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#027.md); [Pro
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009.md), is to be understood that which
is acceptable in its widest generality, equally then in relation to God
and man. It is a question whether ידעון means that they have knowledge
of it (as one e.g., says ידע ספר, to understand writing, i.e., the
reading of it), or that they think thereupon (cf. [Pro
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023).md). Fundamentally the two ideas,
according to the Hebrew conception of the words, lie in each other; for
the central conception, perceiving, is biblically equivalent to a
delighted searching into or going towards the object. Thus: the lips of
the righteous think of that which is acceptable (רצון, cogn. to חן,
gracefulness; χάρις, [Col 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006).md); while
the mouth of the godless is mere falsehood, which God (the wisdom of
God) hates, and from which discord on all sides arises. We might
transfer ידעון to 32b; but this line, interpreted as a clause by itself,
is stronger and more pointed (Fl.).
