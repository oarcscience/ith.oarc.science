### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 15:1</span></span>

Reign of Abijam (cf., 2 Chron 13). - Abijam reigned three years, and his
mother's name was Maacah, daughter (i.e., grand-daughter) of Absalom. We
have the same in [Ch2 11:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020.md); but in
[Ch2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002.md) she is called Michajahu,
daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. If אבישׁלום was without doubt Absalom, the
well-known son of David, as we may infer from the fact that this name
does not occur again in the Old Testament in connection with any other
person, since Absalom had only one daughter, viz., Thamar ([Sa2
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#027).md), who was fifty years old when
Solomon died, Maacah must have been a daughter of this Thamar, who had
married Uriel of Gibeah, and therefore a grand-daughter of Absalom. This
is sustained by Josephus (Ant. viii. 10, 1). The form of the name
מיכיהוּ is probably an error in copying for מעכה, as the name is also
written in [Ch2 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020.md), [Ch2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021.md), and not a different name, which
Maacah assumed as queen, as Caspari supposes (Micha, p. 3, note 4).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 15:3</span></span>

Abijam walked as king in the footsteps of his father. Although he made
presents to the temple ([Kg1 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015).md),
his heart was not שׁלם, wholly or undividedly given to the Lord, like
the heart of David (cf., [Kg1 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004).md);
but (כּי, after a previous negative) for David's sake Jehovah had left
him a light in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him and to let
Jerusalem stand, because (אשׁר) David had done right in the eyes of God,
etc., i.e., so that it was only for David's sake that Jehovah did not
reject him, and allowed the throne to pass to his son. For the fact
itself compare [Kg1 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#013.md), [Kg1
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#036.md); and for the words, "except in
the matter of Uriah the Hittite," see 2 Sam 11 and 12.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 15:6</span></span>

"And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all his life;" i.e.,
the state of hostility which had already existed between Rehoboam and
Jeroboam continued "all the days of his life," or so long as Abijam
lived and reigned. If we take חיּיו כּל־ימי in this manner (not
כּל־ימיהם, [Kg1 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016).md), the statement
loses the strangeness which it has at first sight, and harmonizes very
well with that in [Kg1 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#007.md), that
there was also war between Abijam and Jeroboam. Under Abijam it assumed
the form of a serious war, in which Jeroboam sustained a great defeat
(see 2 Chron 13:3-20). - The other notices concerning Abijam in [Kg1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#007.md), [Kg1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#008.md) are the same as in the case of
Rehoboam in [Kg1 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#029.md), [Kg1
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#031.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 15:9</span></span>

Reign of Asa (cf., 2 Chron 14-16). - As Asa ascended the throne in the
twentieth year of the reign of Jeroboam, his father Abijam, who began to
reign in the eighteenth year of Jeroboam ([Kg1
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001).md), can only have reigned two years
and a few months, and not three full years.

[Kg1 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010.md)

Asa reigned forty-one years. "The name of his mother was Maacah, the
daughter of Absalom." This notice, which agrees verbatim with [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002.md), cannot mean that Abijam had his
own mother for a wife; though Thenius finds this meaning in the passage,
and then proceeds to build up conjectures concerning emendations of the
text. We must rather explain it, as Ephr. Syr., the Rabbins, and others
have done, as signifying that Maacah, the mother of Abijam, continued
during Asa's reign to retain the post of queen-mother or הגּבירה, i.e.,
sultana valide, till Asa deposed her on account of her idolatry ([Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013).md), probably because Asa's own
mother had died at an early age.

[Kg1 15:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#011.md)

As ruler Asa walked in the ways of his pious ancestor David: he banished
the male prostitutes out of the land, abolished all the abominations of
idolatry, which his fathers (Abijam and Rehoboam) had introduced,
deposed his grandmother Maacah from the rank of a queen, because she had
made herself an idol for the Ashera, and had the idol hewn in pieces and
burned in the valley of the Kidron. גּלּלים is a contemptuous epithet
applied to idols ([Lev 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030).md); it does
not mean stercorei, however, as the Rabbins affirm, but logs, from גּלל,
to roll, or masses of stone, after the Chaldee גּלל ([Ezr
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008.md); [Ezr
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#004).md), generally connected with
שׁקּצים. It is so in [Deu 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#016.md).
מפלצת, formido, from פּלץ, terrere, timere, hence an idol as an object
of fear, and not pudendum, a shameful image, as Movers (Phniz. i. p.
571), who follows the Rabbins, explains it, understanding thereby a
Phallus as a symbol of the generative and fructifying power of nature.
With regard to the character of this idol, nothing further can be
determined than that it was of wood, and possibly a wooden column like
the אשׁרים (see at [Kg1 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023).md). "But
the high places departed not," i.e., were not abolished. By the בּמות we
are not to understand, according to [Kg1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012.md), altars of high places dedicated
to idols, but unlawful altars to Jehovah. It is so in the other passages
in which this formula recurs ([Kg1
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md); [Kg2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#004.md); [Kg2
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#004.md); [Kg2
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#004.md); and the parallel passages [Ch2
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#017.md); [Ch2
20:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#033).md). The apparent discrepancy
between the last-mentioned passages and [Ch2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#002.md), [Ch2
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#004.md), and [Ch2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006.md), may be solved very simply on the
supposition that the kings (Asa and Jehoshaphat) did indeed abolish the
altars on the high places, but did not carry their reforms in the nation
thoroughly out; and not by distinguishing between the bamoth dedicated
to Jehovah and those dedicated to idols, as Thenius, Bertheau, and
Caspari, with many of the earlier commentators, suppose. For although
[Ch2 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#002.md) is very favourable to this
solution, since both בּמות and הגּכר dna בּמו מזבּחות are mentioned
there, it does not accord with [Ch2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006.md), where הבּמות cannot be merely
idolatrous altars dedicated to the Canaanitish Baal, but unquestionably
refer to the unlawful altars of Jehovah, or at any rate include them.
Moreover, the next clause in the passage before us, "nevertheless Asa's
heart was wholly given to the Lord," shows that the expression סרוּ לא
סרוּ nois does not mean that the king allowed the unlawful
Jehovah-bamoth to remain, but simply that, notwithstanding his fidelity
to Jehovah, the bamoth did not depart, so that he was unable to carry
the abolition of them thoroughly out.

[Kg1 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015.md)

He brought the sacred offerings of his father and his own sacred
offerings into the house of Jehovah; probably the booty, in silver,
gold, and vessels, which his father Abijam had gathered in the war with
Jeroboam ([Ch2 13:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#016).md), and he
himself on the conquest of the Cushites ([Ch2
14:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#012).md). The Keri וקדשׁי is a bad
emendation of the correct reading in the Chethb קדשׁו, i.e., קדשׁו
(קדשׁיו); for יהוה בּית is an accusative, and is to be connected with
ויּבא.

[Kg1 15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016.md)

The state of hostility between Judah and Israel continued during the
reign of Asa; and Baasha the king of Israel advanced, etc. These
statements are completed and elucidated by the Chronicles. After the
great victory obtained by Abijam over Jeroboam, the kingdom of Judah
enjoyed rest for ten years ([Ch2
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001).md). Asa employed this time in
exterminating idolatry, fortifying different cities, and equipping his
army ([Ch2 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001).md). Then the Cushite
Zerah invaded the land of Judah with an innumerable army (in the
eleventh year of Asa), but was totally defeated by the help of the Lord
([Ch2 14:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008).md); whereupon Asa,
encouraged by the prophet Azariah, the son of Oded, proceeded with fresh
zeal to the extermination of such traces of idolatry as still remained
in the kingdom, then renewed the altar of burnt-offering in front of the
temple-hall, and in the fifteenth year of his reign held, with the whole
nation, a great festival of thanksgiving and rejoicing to the Lord at
Jerusalem ([Ch2 15:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001).md). The next
year, the sixteenth of his reign and the thirty-sixth from the division
of the kingdom ([Ch2 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001).md), Baasha
commenced hostilities, by advancing against Judah, taking possession of
Ramah, the present er Rm (see at [Jos
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025).md), which was only two hours and a
quarter from Jerusalem, and fortifying it. The occupation of Ramah is
not expressly mentioned indeed, but it is implied in יהוּדה על ויּעל על
יה, which affirms the hostile invasion of Judah. For Ramah, from its
very situation in the heart of the tribe of Benjamin and the immediate
neighbourhood of Jerusalem, can neither have been a border city nor have
belonged to the kingdom of Israel. The intention of Baasha, therefore,
in fortifying Ramah cannot have been merely to restrain his own subjects
from passing over into the kingdom of Judah, but was evidently to cut
off from the kingdom of Judah all free communication with the north. וגו
תּת לבלתּי, "that they might not give one going out or one coming in to
Asa;" i.e., to cut off from the others all connection with Asa, and at
the same time to cut off from those with Asa all connection with this
side. The main road from Jerusalem to the north passed by Ramah, so that
by shutting up this road the line of communication of the kingdom of
Judah was of necessity greatly disturbed. Moreover, the fortification of
Ramah by Baasha presupposes the reconquest of the cities which Abijam
had taken from the kingdom of Israel ([Ch2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019).md), and which, according to [Ch2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019.md), were still in the possession of
Asa.

[Kg1 15:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018.md)

In order to avert the danger with which his kingdom was threatened, Asa
endeavoured to induce the Syrian king, Benhadad of Damascus, to break
the treaty which he had concluded with Baasha and to become his ally, by
sending him such treasures as were left in the temple and palace.

(Note: Asa had sought help from the Lord and obtained it, when the
powerful army of the Cushites invaded the land; but when an invasion of
the Israelites took place, he sought help from the Syrians. This
alteration in his conduct may probably be explained in part from the
fact, that notwithstanding the victory, his army had been considerably
weakened by the battle which he fought with the Cushites ([Ch2
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009).md), although this by no means
justified his want of confidence in the power of the Lord, and still
less his harsh and unjust treatment of the prophet Hanani, whom he
caused to be put in the house of the stocks on account of his
condemnation of the confidence which he placed in the Syrians instead of
Jehovah ([Ch2 16:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007))..md)

הגּותרים may be explained from the face that the temple and palace
treasures had been plundered by Shishak in the reign of Rehoboam ([Kg1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#026).md); and therefore what Asa had
replaced in the temple treasury ([Kg1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015).md), and had collected together for
his palace, was only a remnant in comparison with the former state of
these treasures. The name בּן־הדד, i.e., son of Hadad, the sun-god
(according to Macrobius, i. 23; cf., Movers, Phniz. i. p. 196), was
borne by three kings of Damascus: the one here named, his son in the
time of Ahab ([Kg1 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001.md), [Kg1
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034).md), and the son of Hazael ([Kg2
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#024).md). The first was a son of
Tabrimmon and grandson of Hezyon. According to [Kg1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019.md), his father Tabrimmon (good is
Rimmon; see at [Kg2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018).md) had also
been king, and was the contemporary of Abijam. But that his grandfather
Hezyon was also king, and the same person as the Rezon mentioned in [Kg1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023.md), cannot be shown to be even
probable, since there is no ground for the assumption that Hezyon also
bore the name Rezon, and is called by the latter name here and by the
former in [Kg1 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023.md).

[Kg1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020.md)

Benhadad consented to Asa's request, and directed his captains to
advance into the kingdom of Israel: they took several cities in the
north of the land, whereby Baasha was compelled to give up fortifying
Ramah and withdraw to Thirza. Ijon (עיּון) is to be sought for in all
probability in Tell Dibbin, on the eastern border of Merj Ayun; and in
Ajun, although Ajun is written with Aleph, the name Ijon is probably
preserved, since the situation of this Tell seems thoroughly adapted for
a fortress on the northern border of Israel (vid., Robinson, Bibl. Res.
p. 375, and Van de Velde, Mem. p. 322). Dan is the present Tell el Kadi;
see at [Jos 19:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047.md). Abel-Beth-Maachah,
the present Abil el Kamh, to the north-west of Lake Huleh (see at [Sa2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#014).md). "All Chinneroth" is the
district of Chinnereth, the tract of land on the western shore of the
Lake of Gennesareth (see at [Jos
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035).md). כּל־ארץ נ על, together with
all the land of Naphtali (for this meaning of על fo gninaem compare the
Comm. on [Gen 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012).md). The cities named
were the principal fortresses of the land of Naphtali, with which the
whole of the country round was also smitten, i.e., laid waste.

[Kg1 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#021.md)

ויּשׁב, and remained at Thirza, his place of residence (see at [Kg1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017).md).

[Kg1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022.md)

Asa thereupon summoned all Judah נקי אין, nemine immuni, i.e., excepto,
no one being free (cf., Ewald, 286, a.), and had the stones and the wood
carried away from Ramah, and Geba and Mizpah in Benjamin built, i.e.,
fortified, with them. Geba must not be confounded with Gibeah of
Benjamin or Saul, but is the present Jeba, three-quarters of an hour to
the north-east of Ramah (see at [Jos
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024).md). Mizpah, the present Nebi
Samwil, about three-quarters of a geographical mile to the south-west of
Ramah (see at [Jos 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026).md).

[Kg1 15:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023.md)

Of the other acts of Asa, the building of cities refers to the building
of fortifications mentioned in [Ch2
14:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#005.md). The disease in his feet in the
time of his old age commenced, according to [Ch2
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012.md), in the thirty-ninth year of his
reign; and he sought help from the physicians, but not from the Lord;
from which we may see, that the longer he lived the more he turned his
heart away from the Lord (compare [Ch2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#010).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 15:25</span></span>

The Reign of Nadab lasted not quite two years, as he ascended the throne
in the second year of Asa, and was slain in his third year.

[Kg1 15:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#026.md)

He walked in the ways of his father (Jeroboam) and in his sin, i.e., in
the calf-worship introduced by Jeroboam ([Kg1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028).md). When Nadab in the second year
of his reign besieged Gibbethon, which the Philistines and occupied,
Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house, I the family or tribe, of
Issachar, conspired against him and slew him, and after he became king
exterminated the whole house of Jeroboam, without leaving a single soul,
whereby the prediction of the prophet Ahijah ([Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010)..md) was fulfilled. Gibbethon,
which was allotted to the Danites ([Jos
19:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#044).md), has not yet been discovered.
It probably stood close to the Philistian border, and was taken by the
Philistines, from whom the Israelites attempted to wrest it by siege
under both Nadab and Baasha ([Kg1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#016).md), though apparently without
success. לא השׁאיר כּל־נשׁמה as in [Jos
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#014.md) (see the Comm. on [Deu
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#016).md).

[Kg1 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#032.md)

[Kg1 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#032.md) is simply a repetition of
[Kg1 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016.md); and the remark concerning
Baasha's attitude towards Asa of Judah immediately after his entrance
upon the government precedes the account of his reign, for the purpose
of indicating at the very outset, that the overthrow of the dynasty of
Jeroboam and the rise of a new dynasty did not alter the hostile
relation between the kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Judah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 15:33</span></span>

The Reign of Baasha is described very briefly according to its duration
(two years) and its spirit, namely, the attitude of Baasha towards the
Lord ([Kg1 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#034).md); there then follow
in [Kg1 16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md) the words of the
prophet Jehu, the son of Hanani ([Ch2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007).md), concerning the extermination of
the family of Baasha; and lastly, in [Kg1
16:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#005.md), his death is related with the
standing allusion to the annals of the kings. The words of Jehu
concerning Baasha ([Kg1 16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001).md)
coincide exactly mutatis mutandis with the words of Ahijah concerning
Jeroboam.

(Note: "There was something very strange in the perversity and stolidity
of the kings of Israel, that when they saw that the families of
preceding kings were evidently overthrown by the command of God on
account of the worship of the calves, and they themselves had overturned
them, they nevertheless worshipped the same calves, and placed them
before the people for them to worship, that they might not return to the
temple and to Asa, king of Jerusalem; though prophets denounced it and
threatened their destruction. Truly the devil and the ambition of
reigning blinded them and deprived them of their senses. Hence it came
to pass, through the just judgment of God, that they all were
executioners of one another in turn: Baasha was the executioner of the
sons of Jeroboam; Zambri was the executioner of the sons of Baasha; and
the executioner of Zambri was Omri." - \_C. a Lapide.)

The expression "exalted thee out of the dust," instead of "from among
the people" ([Kg1 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#007).md), leads to the
conjecture that Baasha had risen to be king from a very low position.
גּבוּרתו (his might) in [Kg1 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#005.md)
refers, as in the case of Asa ([Kg1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023).md), less to brave warlike deeds,
than generally to the manifestation of strength and energy in his
government.
