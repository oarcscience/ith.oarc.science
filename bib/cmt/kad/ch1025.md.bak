### [1 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 25:1</span></span>

The twenty-four classes of musicians. - [Ch1
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md). "David and the princes of the
host separated for the service the sons of Asaph," etc. הצּבא שׂרי are
not princes of the Levite host; for although the service of the Levites
is called צבא צבא in [Num 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#023.md), yet
the princes of the Levites are nowhere called הצבא שׂרי. This expression
rather denotes either the leaders of the army of the chiefs of Israel,
as the host of Jahve, [Exo 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#017.md), [Exo
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#041.md), etc. Here it is used in the
last signification, as synonymous with princes of Israel ([Ch1
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002).md); in [Exo
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#006.md) we have simply the princes, along
with whom the heads of the fathers'-houses of the priests and the
Levites are mentioned. לעבדה הבדּיל, separate for the service; cf. [Num
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#009.md). The ל in אסף לבני is nota acc.
Since Asaph was, according to [Ch1
6:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039.md), a descendant of Gershon,
Heman, according to [Ch1 6:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md), a
descendant of Kohath, and Jeduthun (= Ethan) a descendant of Merari
([Ch1 6:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044).md), all the chief families
of Levi had representatives among the singers. The Kethibh הנביאים is an
orthographical error for הנּבּאים (Keri), partic. Niph., corresponding
to the singular הנּבּא, [Ch1 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md) and
[Ch1 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003.md). נּבּא, prophetare, is here
used in its wider signification of the singing and playing to the praise
of God performed in the power of the Divine Spirit. In reference to the
instruments of these chief musicians, cf. [Ch1
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016.md). The suffix in מספּרם refers to
the following noun, which is subordinated to the word מספּר as genitive;
cf. the similar construction עצל נפשׁו, his, the sluggard's, soul, [Pro
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004.md), and Ew. 309, e. "Their number
(the number) of the workmen for the service, i.e., of those who
performed the work of the service, was (as follows)."

[1 Chronicles 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 25:2</span></span>

With אסף לבני the enumeration beings: "Of Asaph's sons were, or to
Asaph's sons belonged, Zacchur," etc. Four are here named, but the
number is not stated, while it is given in the case of the sons of
Jeduthun and Heman, [Ch1 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003.md) and [Ch1
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005.md). על־יד, at the hand, alternates
with על־ידי ([Ch1 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003.md) and [Ch1
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#006).md), and אסף יד על does not of
itself express a different relationship to Asaph than that expressed by
המּלך ידי על with reference to the king. It signifies only "under
(according to) the direction of;" and in [Ch1
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#006.md) the king, Asaph, Jeduthun, and
Heman are co-ordinated, inasmuch as the musical part of the worship was
arranged by David and the three chief musicians in common, although only
the latter were concerned in its performance. In [Ch1
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003.md) לידוּתוּן is placed at the
beginning, because the choir of singers led by him bore his name; and so
also in the case of Heman, [Ch1 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md).
"As to Jeduthun, were sons of Jeduthun." The word sons in these
catalogues denotes not merely actual sons, but those intellectually
sons, i.e., scholars taught by the master. This is clear from the fact
that the twenty-four classes, each of which numbered twelve men, consist
of sons and brothers of the leaders. The names given as those of the
sons of Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, in [Ch1
25:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md), do not represent the whole
number of the scholars of these masters, but only the presidents of the
twenty-four classes of Levites who were engaged under their leadership
in performing the sacred music. Only five sons of Jeduthun are named in
our text, while according to the number given there should be six. A
comparison of the names in vv. 9-31 shows that in [Ch1
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003.md) the name שׁמעי ([Ch1
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#017).md) has been dropped out. בּכּנּור
belongs to ידוּתוּן: under the direction of their father Jeduthun (the
master), upon the kinnor (see on [Ch1
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016).md), who was inspired to sing
praise, i.e., who played inspiredly to bring praise and honour to the
Lord; cf. [Ch1 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#004.md); [Ch1
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#030.md), etc.

[1 Chronicles 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 25:4</span></span>

Fourteen sons of Heman are enumerated. עזר רממתּי is one name, cf. 31,
although עזר is without doubt to be supplied also after גּדּלתּי.
Probably also מחזיאות is to be supplied in thought after the names.
מלותי, I made full, and הותיר, increased.

(Note: On these names Ewald ways, ausf. Lehrb. der Hebr. Sprache, 274,
S. 672, der 7 Ausg.: "It is thought that the utterance of a great
prophet is to be found cut up into names of near relatives, when the
words,

עזר רממתּי גּדּלתּי

מחזיאות הותיר מלותי

'I have given great and lofty help,

I have to fulness spoken oracles,'

which manifestly form a verse, and may have been the commencement of a
famed ancient oracle, are found transferred to the five musical sons of
Heman, Giddalti(ezer), Romamtiezer, Mallothi, Hothir, and Machazioth.")

Heman is called in [Ch1 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005.md) the seer
of the king in the words of God, because he, along with his gift of
song, was endowed also with the prophetic gift, and as seer made known
to the king revelations of God. In [Ch2
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015.md) the same thing is predicated
also of Jeduthun, and in the same sense the prophet Gad is called in
[Ch1 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#009.md) David's seer. קרן להרים the
Masoretes have connected with the preceding, by placing Athnach under
the קרן, and the phrase has been wholly misunderstood by the Rabbins and
Christian commentators. Berth., e.g., connects it with האלהים בּדברי,
and translates, "to sound loud upon horns, according to the divine
command," referring to [Ch2 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#015.md),
where, however, both meaning and accentuation forbid us to connect יהוה
בּדברי with what follows. This interpretation of the words is thoroughly
wrong, not only because the Levites under Heman's direction did not blow
horns, the horn not being one of the instruments played by the Levites
in connection with the worship, but also because on linguistic grounds
it is objectionable. קרן הרים קרן .el never has the signification to
blow the horn; for to elevate the horn signifies everywhere to heighten
the power of any one, or unfold, show power; cf. [Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md); [Lam
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017.md); [Psa
148:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014.md); [Psa
89:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#018.md); [Psa
92:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#011.md), etc. That is the meaning of the
phrase here, and the words are to be connected, according to their
sense, with what follows: "to elevate the horn," i.e., to give power,
God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters; i.e., to make Heman's
race mighty for the praise of God, God gave him so many sons and
daughters.

[1 Chronicles 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 25:6</span></span>

[Ch1 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#006.md) is the subscription to the
enumeration, [Ch1 25:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md). כּל־אלּה are
not the fourteen sons of Heman, but all the sons of Asaph, Jeduthun, and
Heman. All these were under the direction of their fathers for song in
the house of Jahve, with cymbals ... for the service in the house of God
under the direction of the king, etc. אביהם is used distributively of
each father of the sons named. Bertheau supplies after אביהם the name
Heman, and thereby the first half of the verse contradicts the second,
which he correctly understands to refer to the twenty-four persons
enumerated. - In [Ch1 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#007.md) the total
number is given. Their number (the number) of the sons of Asaph,
Jeduthun, and Heman (i.e., of the twenty-four 4 + 6 + 14 mentioned by
name), with their brethren, was 288 (24 x 12); whence we learn that each
of those named had eleven אחים, all of them שׁיר מלמּדי שׁיר, learned,
practised in song for Jahve. In כּל־המּבין the sons and the brothers are
both included, in order to give the total number. מבין, having
understanding, knowledge of a thing, denotes here those who by education
and practice were skilled in song - the accomplished musicians. Their
number was 288, and these were divided into twenty-four choirs
(classes). David had, according to [Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005.md), appointed 4000 Levites for the
performance of the music. Of these, 288 were מבינים skilled in song; the
others were scholars (תּלמידים), as [Ch1
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#008.md) shows, where מבין and תּלמיד are
the two categories into which the musicians are divided.

[1 Chronicles 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 25:8</span></span>

They cast lots, משׁמרת גּורלות, κλήρους ἐφημερίων (lxx), by which the
משׁמרת, the waiting upon the service, was fixed, that is, the order of
their succession in the official service. לעמּת is variously translated.
As no name follows, R. Shel. and Kimchi would repeat the preceding
משׁמרת: one class as the other; and this is supported by [Ch1
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#016.md) and [Neh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#024.md), and by the fact that in [Ch1
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#005.md), after ממּשׁכּן, the words משׁכּן
אל have been dropped out. But according to the accentuation משׁמרת
belongs to גּורלות, and so the proposed completion is at once disposed
of. Besides this, however, the thought "class like class" does not
appear quite suitable, as the classes were only formed by the lots, and
so were not in existence so as to be able to cast lots. We therefore,
with Ewald, 360, a, and Berth., hold the clause כּגּדול כּקּטן to be the
genitive belonging to לעמּת, since עמּת is in [Ecc
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015.md) also connected with a clause: "in
the manner of, as the small, so the great," i.e., the small and the
great, the older as the younger. This is further defined by "the skilled
as the scholars." From these words it is manifest that not merely the
288 cast lots, for these were כּל־מבין ([Ch1
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#007).md), but also the other 3712 Levites
appointed for the service of the singers; whence it further follows that
only the 288 who were divided by lot into twenty-four classes, each
numbering twelve persons, were thoroughly skilled in singing and
playing, and the scholars were so distributed to them that each class
received an equal number of them, whom they had to educate and train.
These, then, were probably trained up for and employed in the temple
music according to their progress in their education, so that the
ἐφημερία which had at any time charge of the service consisted not only
of the twelve skilled musicians, but also of a number of scholars who
assisted in singing and playing under their direction.

[1 Chronicles 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 25:9</span></span>

The order of succession was so determined by lot, that the four sons of
Asaph ([Ch1 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003).md) received the first,
third, fifth, and seventh places; the six sons of Jeduthun, the second,
fourth, eighth, twelfth, and fourteenth; and finally, the four sons of
Heman (first mentioned in [Ch1 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004).md),
the sixth, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth places; while the remaining
places, [Ch1 25:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#015.md), fell to the
other sons of Heman. From this we learn that the lots of the sons of the
three chief musicians were not placed in separate urns, and one lot
drawn from each alternately; but that, on the contrary, all the lots
were placed in one urn, and in drawing the lots of Asaph and Jeduthun
came out so, that after the fourteenth drawing only sons of Heman
remained.

(Note: Bertheau, S. 218, draws quite another conclusion from the
above-mentioned order in which the lots were drawn. He supposes "that
two series, each of seven, were first included in the lot: to the one
series belonged the four sons of Asaph and the three sons of Heman,
Mattaniah, Uzziel or Azarel, and Shebuel or Shubael; to the other, the
six sons of Jeduthun and Bukkiah the son of Heman. A lot was drawn from
each series alternately, commencing with the first, so that the four
sons of Asaph and the three sons of Heman obtained the places 1, 3, 5,
7, 9, 11, 13; while to the six sons of Jeduthun, and the son of Heman
added to them, fell the places 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. The still
remaining ten sons of Heman were then finally drawn for, and received
the placed from the 15th to the 24th." This very artificial hypothesis
explains, indeed, the order of the lots, but we cannot think it
probable, because (1) for the supposed dividing of the lots to be drawn
into divisions of 10 and 14 no reason can be assigned; (2) by any such
division the sons of Heman would have been placed at a disadvantage from
the beginning as compared with the sons of Asaph and Jeduthun, since not
only Asaph's four sons, but also all Jeduthun's six sons, would have
been placed in the first rank, while only four sons of Heman accompany
them, Heman's ten remaining sons having had the last place assigned
them.)

As to the details in [Ch1 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#009.md), after
Joseph we miss the statement, "he and his sons and his brothers,
twelve;" which, with the exception of the הוּא, used only of the second
lot, and omitted for the sake of brevity in all the other cases, is
repeated with all the 23 numbers, and so can have been dropped here only
by an error. The words ליוסף לאסף are to be understood thus: The first
lot drawn was for Asaph, viz., for his son Joseph. In the succeeding
verses the names are enumerated, sometimes with and sometimes without ל.
Some of the names diverge somewhat in form. Izri, [Ch1
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#011.md), stands for Zeri, [Ch1
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003.md); Jesharelah, [Ch1
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#014.md), for Asarelah, [Ch1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md); Azarel, [Ch1
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#018.md), for Uzziel, [Ch1
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md) (like the king's names Uzziah and
Azariah, [Ch1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#012.md), and [Ch2
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001).md); Shubael, [Ch1
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#020.md), for Shebuel, [Ch1
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md) (cf. [Ch1
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#016.md) with [Ch1
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020).md); Jeremoth, [Ch1
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#022.md), for Jerimoth, [Ch1
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md); Eliyathah, [Ch1
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#027.md), for Eliathah, [Ch1
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md). Besides these, the fuller forms
Nethanyahu ([Ch1 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#012).md), Hashabyahu
([Ch1 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003).md), Hananyahu ([Ch1
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#023).md), are used instead of the
shorter Nethaniah, etc. ([Ch1 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md),
[Ch1 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#019.md), [Ch1
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004).md). Of the 24 names which are here
enumerated, besides those of Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, only Mattithiah
recurs ([Ch1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018.md), [Ch1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021).md) in the description of the
solemnities connected with the bringing in of the ark; "but we are not
justified in seeking there the names of our twenty-four classes"
(Berth.).
