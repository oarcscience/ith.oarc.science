Second Prophecy - Isaiah 41

The God of the World's History and of Prophecy

Jehovah comes forward here, and speaking in the tone in which He already
began to speak in [Isa 40:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#025.md), invites
the idolatrous nations to contend with Him, declares the raising up of
the conqueror from the east to be His work, and adduces this as the sign
that He has been the Author and Guider of the world's history from the
beginning. But what if the question should be asked on the part of the
nations, With what right does He do this? The acts of the conqueror
prove themselves to be a work of the God who is exalted above the idols,
from the fact that they bring destruction to the idolatrous nations, and
to the people of Jehovah the long-desired redemption. It is in this that
the conclusiveness of the illustration lies. The argument, however,
presupposes that Cyrus has already entered upon his victorious course.
It is evident at the outset that future events, or events still
unfulfilled, would have no force as present proofs. And the words also
clearly imply, that the work which Jehovah attributes to Himself, in
opposition to the gods of the nations, is already in progress.

[Isaiah 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 41:1</span></span>

Summons to the contest: "Be silent to me, ye islands; and let the
nations procure fresh strength: let them come near, then speak; we will
enter into contest together." The words are addressed to the whole of
the heathen world, and first of all to the inhabitants of the western
islands and coasts. This was the expression commonly employed in the Old
Testament to designate the continent of Europe, the solid ground of
which is so deeply cut, and so broken up, by seas and lakes, that it
looks as if it were about to resolve itself into nothing but islands and
peninsulas. על החרישׁ is a pregnant expression for turning in silence
towards a person; just as in [Job
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#013.md) it is used with min, in the
sense of forsaking a person in silence. That they may have no excuse if
they are defeated, they are to put on fresh strength; just as in [Isa
40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031.md) believers are spoken of as
drawing fresh strength out of Jehovah's fulness. They are to draw near,
then speak, i.e., to reply after hearing the evidence, for Jehovah
desires to go through all the forms of a legal process with them in pro
et contra. The mishpât is thought of here in a local sense, as a forum
or tribunal. But if Jehovah is one party to the cause, who is the judge
to pronounce the decision? The answer to this question is the same as at
[Isa 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003.md). "The nations," says
Rosenmller, "are called to judgment, not to the tribunal of God, but to
that of reason." The deciding authority is reason, which cannot fail to
recognise the facts, and the consequences to be deduced from them.

[Isaiah 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 41:2</span></span>

The parties invited are now to be thought of as present, and Jehovah
commences in [Isa 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md) : "Who hath
raised up the man from the rising of the sun, whom justice meets at his
foot, He giveth up nations before him, and kings He subdues, giveth men
like the dust to his sword, and like driven stubble to his bow?" The
sentence governed by "who" (mı̄) ends at leraglō (at his foot); at the
same time, all that follows is spoken with the echo of the interrogative
accent. The person raised up is Cyrus, who is afterwards mentioned by
name. The coming one (if, that is to say, we adhere to the belief in
Isaiah's authorship of these addresses) first approaches gradually
within the horizon of the prophet's ideal present; and it is only little
by little that the prophet becomes more intimately acquainted with a
phenomenon which belongs to so distant a future, and has been brought so
close to his own eyes. Jehovah has raised up the new great hero "from
the east" (mimmizrâch), and, according to [Isa
41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025.md), "from the north" also. Both of
these were fulfilled; for Cyrus was a Persian belonging to the clan of
Achaemenes (Hakhâmanis), which stood at the head of the tribe, or of the
Pasargadae. He was the son of Cambyses; and even if the Median princess
Mandane were not his mother, yet, according to nearly all the ancient
accounts, he was connected with the royal house of Media; at any rate,
after Astyages was dethroned, he became head and chief of the Medes as
well as of the Persians (hence the name of "Mule" which was give to him
by the oracle, and that given by Jerome, "agitator bigae"). Now Media
was to the north of Babylonia, and Persia to the east; so that his
victorious march, in which, even before the conquest of Babylon, he
subjugated all the lands from the heights of Hinduku to the shores of
the Aegean Sea, had for its starting-point both the east and north.

(Note: See Pahl'es Geschichte des Oriental. Alterthums. (1864), p.
170ff.)

The clause לרגלו יקראהוּ צדק is an attributive clause, and as such a
virtual object: "him whom (supply עת־אשׁר) justice comes to meet (קרא) =
קרה, Ges. 75, vi.) on his track" (cf., [Gen
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#030.md); [Job
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#011.md); [Hab
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#005).md). The idea of tsedeq is determined
by what follows: Jehovah gives up nations before him, and causes kings
to be trodden down (causative of râdâh). Accordingly, tsedeq is either
to be understood here in an attributive sense, as denoting the justice
exercised by a person (viz., the justice executed successfully by Cyrus,
as the instrument of Jehovah, by the force of arms); or objectively of
the justice awarded to a person (to which the idea of "meeting" is more
appropriate), viz., the favourable result, the victory which procures
justice for the just cause of the combatant. Rosenmller, Knobel, and
others, are wrong in maintaining that tsedeq (tsedâqâh) in chapters
40-66 signifies primarily justice, and the prosperity and salvation as
its reward. The word means straightness, justice, righteousness, and
nothing more (from tsâdaq, to be hard, firm, extended, straight, e.g.,
rumh-un-tsadq, a hard, firm, and straight lance); but it has a double
aspect, because justice consists, according to circumstances, of either
wrath of favour, and therefore has sometimes the idea of the strict
execution of justice, as in this instance, sometimes of a manifestation
of justice in fidelity to promises, as in [Isa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md). יתּן is repeated here in [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md) (just like וילמדהו in [Isa
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#014).md) with the same subject, but in a
different sense. To make sword and bow the subject, in the sense of "his
sword gives (sc., 'the foe')," is a doubtful thing in itself; and as
cherebh and qesheth are feminines, it is by no means advisable.
Moreover, in other instances, the comparative כ leaves it to the reader
to carry out the figure indicated according to his own fancy. And this
is the case here: He (Jehovah) makes his sword as if there were dust,
his bow as if there were hunted stubble (Bttcher), i.e., pounding the
enemy like dust, and hunting it like flying stubble. Our text has כּעפר,
but in certain codices we find כּעפר with tzere; and this reading, which
is contrary to rule, has in its favour the express testimony of Moses
the punctuator.

(Note: In his הנקוד דרכי (rules of pointing), with which the Masora
finalis is surrounded.)

[Isaiah 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 41:3</span></span>

The conqueror is now still further described in futures, which might be
defined by העיר, and so express a simultaneous past (synchronistic
imperfects), but which it is safer to take as standing traits in the
picture drawn of the conqueror referred to. "He pursueth them and
marcheth in peace by a course which he never trod with his feet." He
marches victoriously further and further, shâlōm," i.e., "in safety"
(or, as an adjective, safely; [Job
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009).md), without any one being able to
do him harm, by a course (accus. Ges. 138, 1) which he has not been
accustomed to tread with his feet (ingredi).

[Isaiah 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 41:4</span></span>

The great fact of the present time, which not one of the gods of the
heathen can boast of having brought to pass, is now explained. Jehovah
is its author. "Who hath wrought and executed it? He who calleth the
generations of men from the beginning, I Jehovah am first, and with the
last am I He." The synonyms פּעל and עשׂה are distinguished from each
other in the same way as "to work" (or bring about) and "to realize" (or
carry out). Hence the meaning is, Who is the author to whom both the
origin and progress of such an occurrence are to be referred? It is He
who "from the beginning," i.e., ever since there has been a human
history, has called into existence the generations of men through His
authoritative command. And this is no other than Jehovah, who can
declare of Himself, in contrast with the heathen and their gods, who are
of yesterday, and tomorrow will not be: I am Jehovah, the very first,
whose being precedes all history; and with the men of the latest
generations yet to come "I am it." הוּא is not introduced here to
strengthen the subject, ego ille "I and no other," as in [Isa
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016), which see.md); but, as in [Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md), [Isa
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013.md); [Isa
56:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#004.md); [Isa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012.md), it is a predicate of the
substantive clause, ego sum is (ille), viz., 'Elōhı̄m; or even as in [Psa
102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md) (cf., [Job
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#019.md) and [Heb
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008)), ego sum idem (Hitzig.md). They are
both included, without any distinction in the assertion. He is this,
viz., God throughout all ages, and is through all ages He, i.e., the
Being who is ever the same in this His deity. It is the full meaning of
the name Jehovah which is unfolded here; for God is called Jehovah as
the absolute I, the absolutely free Being, pervading all history, and
yet above all history, as He who is Lord of His own absolute being, in
revealing which He is purely self-determined; in a word, as the
unconditionally free and unchangeably eternal personality.

[Isaiah 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 41:5</span></span>

In the following v. we have not a description of the impression made
upon the heathen by the argument of Jehovah, but the argument itself is
continued. [Isa 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#005.md) "Islands have
seen it, and shuddered; the ends of the earth trembled; they have
approached, and drawn near." We have here a description of the effects
which the victorious course of Cyrus had begun to produce in the heathen
world. The perfects denote the past, and the futures a simultaneous
past; so that we have not to compare [Isa
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#005.md) with [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md) so much as with [Psa
77:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#017.md). The play upon the words
וייראּוּ ... ראּוּ pairs together both seeing and fearing. The Cumaeans,
when consulting the oracle, commenced thus: ἡμεῖς δὲ δειμαίνοντες τὴν
Περσέων δύναμιν. The perfect with the aorist following in [Isa
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#005.md) places the following picture upon
the stage: They have approached and drawn near (from all directions) to
meet the threatening danger; and how? [Isa
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#006.md), [Isa
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007.md) "One helped his companion, and he
said to his brother, Only firm! The caster put firmness into the melter,
the hammer-smoother into the anvil-smiter, saying of the soldering, It
is good; and made him firm with nails, that he should not shake." Him,
viz., the idol. Everything is in confusion, from the terror that
prevails; and the gods from which they expect deliverance are not made
till now, the workmen stimulating one another to work. The chârâsh, who
casts the image, encourages the tsōrēph, whose task it is to provide it
with the plating of gold and silver chains ([Isa
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#019).md), to work more bravely; and the
man who smooths with the hammer (pattish, instrumentalis) does the same
to the man who smites the anvil (הולם with seghol, whereas in other
cases, e.g., [Eze 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025.md), the tone
generally gives way without any change in the vowel-pointing). The
latter finds the soldering all right, by which the gold plates of the
covering are fastened together, so as to give to the golden idol a
massive appearance. He is the last into whose hands it comes; and
nothing more is wanting, than that he should forge upon the anvil the
nails with which it is fastened, to prevent it from falling. To such
foolish, fruitless proceedings have the nations resorted when threatened
with subjugation by Cyrus.

[Isaiah 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 41:8</span></span>

The proof adduced by Jehovah of His own deity closes here. But instead
of our hearing whether the nations, with which He has entered upon the
contest, have any reply to make, the address turns to Israel, upon which
deliverance dawns from that very quarter, from which the others are
threatened with destruction. "And thou, Israel my servant, Jacob whom I
have chosen, seed of Abraham my friend, thou whom I have laid hold of
from the ends of the earth, and called from the corners thereof, and
said to thee, Thou art my servant, I have chosen and not despised thee;
fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not afraid, for I am thy God: I
have chosen thee, I also help thee, I also hold thee with the right hand
of my righteousness." The ו before ואתּה connects together antitheses,
which show themselves at once to be antitheses. Whereas the nations,
which put their trust in idols that they themselves had made, were
thrown into alarm, and yielded before the world-wide commotions that had
originated with the eastern conqueror, Israel, the nation of Jehovah,
might take comfort to itself. Every word here breathes the deepest
affection. The address moves on in soft undulating lines. The repetition
of the suffix ך, with which אשׁר forms a relative of the second person,
for which we have no equivalent in our language (Ges. 123, Anm. 1),
gives to the address a pressing, clinging, and, as it were, loving
key-note. The reason, which precedes the comforting assurance in [Isa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md), recals the intimate relation in
which Jehovah had placed Himself towards Israel, and Israel towards
Himself. The leading thought, "servant of Jehovah," which is
characteristic of chapters 40-46, and lies at the root of the whole
spirit of these addresses, more especially of their Christology, we
first meet with here, and that in a popular sense. It has both an
objective and a subjective side. On the one hand, Israel is the servant
of Jehovah by virtue of a divine act; and this act, viz., its election
and call, was an act of pure grace, and was not to be traced, as the
expression "I have chosen and not despised thee' indicates, to any
superior excellence or merit on the part of Israel. On the contrary,
Israel was so obscure that Jehovah might have despised it; nevertheless
He had anticipated it in free unmerited love with this stamp of the
character indelibilis of a servant of Jehovah. On the other hand, Israel
was the servant of Jehovah, inasmuch as it acted out what Jehovah had
made it, partly in reverential worship of this God, and partly in active
obedience. את־ה עבד, i.e., "serving Jehovah," includes both liturgical
service (also עבד absolutely, [Isa
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023).md) and the service of works. The
divine act of choosing and calling is dated from Abraham. From a
Palestinian point of view, Ur of Chaldaea, within the old kingdom of
Nimrod, and Haran in northern Mesopotamia, seemed like the ends and
corners of the earth ('ătsı̄lı̄m, remote places, from 'âtsal, to put aside
or apart). Israel and the land of Israel were so inseparably connected,
that whenever the origin of Israel was spoken of, the point of view
could only be taken in Palestine. To the far distant land of the Tigris
and Euphrates had Jehovah gone to fetch Abraham, "the friend of God"
([Jam 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023).md), who is called in the East
even to the present day, chalil ollah, the friend of God. This calling
of Abraham was the furthest terminus a quo of the existence of Israel as
the covenant nation; for the leading of Abraham was providentially
appointed with reference to the rise of Israel as a nation. The latter
was pre-existent in him by virtue of the counsel of God. And when
Jehovah adopted Abraham as His servant, and called him "my servant"
([Gen 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#024).md), Israel, the nation that
was coming into existence in Abraham, received both the essence and name
of a "servant of Jehovah." Inasmuch then as, on looking back to its past
history, it would not fail to perceive that it was so thoroughly a
creation of divine power and grace, it ought not to be fearful, and look
about with timidity and anxiety; for He who had presented Himself at the
very beginning as its God, was still always near. The question arises,
in connection with the word אמּצתּי, whether it means to strengthen
([Isa 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003.md); [Psa
89:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#022).md), or to lay firm hold of, to
attach firmly to one's self, to choose. We decide in favour of the
latter meaning, which is established by [Isa
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#014.md), cf., [Psa
80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md), [Psa
80:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#018.md). The other perfects affirm what
Jehovah has ever done, and still continues to do. In the expression "by
the right hand of my righteousness," the justice or righteousness is
regarded pre-eminently on its brighter side, the side turned towards
Israel; but it is also regarded on its fiery side, or the side turned
towards the enemies of Israel. It is the righteousness which aids the
oppressed congregation against its oppressors. The repeated אף heaps one
synonym upon another, expressive of the divine love; for ו simply
connects, גּם appends, אף heaps up (cumulat). Language is too contracted
to hold all the fulness of the divine love; and for this reason the
latter could not find words enough to express all that it desired.

[Isaiah 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 41:11</span></span>

With the exclamation hēn (behold) the eyes of Israel are now directed to
the saving interposition of Jehovah in the immediate future. "Behold,
all they that were incensed against thee must be ashamed and confounded;
the men of thy conflict become as nothing, and perish. Thou wilt seek
them, and not find them, the men of thy feuds; the men of thy warfare
become as nothing, and nonentity. For I, Jehovah thy God, lay hold of
thy right hand, He who saith to thee, Fear not; I will help thee." The
comprehensive expression omnes inflammati in te (niphal, as in [Isa
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024).md) stands at the head; and then,
in order that every kind may be included, the enemies are called by a
different name every time. The three substantives bear much the same
relation to one another as lis, rixa, bellum (milchâmâh, lit., throng =
war-tumult, like the epic κλόνος), hence adversarii, inimici, hostes.
The suffixes have the force of objective genitives. We have founded our
translation upon the reading מצּוּתיך. The three names of the enemies
are placed emphatically at the close of the sentences, and these are
long drawn out, whilst the indignation gives vent to itself; whereas in
[Isa 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#013.md) there follows nothing but
short sentences, in which the persecuted church is encouraged and
affectionately embraced. Two clauses, which are made to rhyme with ēm,
announce the utter destruction of their foes; then the inflective rhyme
ekha is repeated five times; and the sixth time it passes over into
ı̄kha.

[Isaiah 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 41:14</span></span>

The consolatory words, "Fear not," are now repeated, for the purpose of
once more adding the promise that Israel will not succumb to its foes,
but will acquire power over its enemies. "Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and
handful Israel: I will help thee, saith Jehovah; and thy Redeemer is the
Holy One of Israel. Behold, I have made thee a threshing roller, a sharp
new one, with double edges: thou wilt thresh mountains, and pound them;
and hills thou wilt make like chaff. Thou wilt winnow them, and wind
carries them away, and tempest scatters them: and thou wilt rejoice in
Jehovah, and glory in the Holy One of Israel." Israel, which is now
helplessly oppressed, is called "worm of Jacob" (gen. appos.) in
compassion, i.e., Jacob that is like a worm, probably with some allusion
to [Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007.md); for the image of the
Messiah enriches itself in these discourses, inasmuch as Israel itself
is looked upon in a Messianic light, so that the second David does not
stand by the side of Israel, but appears as Israel's heart, or true and
inmost essence. The people are then addressed as the "people of Israel,"
with some allusion to the phrase מספּר מתי (i.e., few men, easily
numbered) in [Gen 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030.md); [Deu
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#027.md) (lxx ὀλιγοστὸσ ̓Ισραήλ; Luther,
Ir armer hauffe Israel, ye poor crowd of Israel). They no longer formed
the compact mass of a nation; the band of the commonwealth was broken:
they were melted down into a few individuals, scattered about hither and
thither. But it would not continue so. "I help thee" (perfect of
certainty) is Jehovah's solemn declaration; and the Redeemer (redemtor,
[Lev 25:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#048).md) of His now enslaved
people is the Holy One of Israel, with His love, which perpetually
triumphs over wrath. Not only will He set it free, but He will also
endow it with might over its oppressors; samtı̄kh is a perfect of
assurance (Ges. 126, 4); mōrag (roller) signifies a threshing-sledge
(Arab. naureg, nōreg), which has here the term חרוּץ ([Isa
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027).md) as a secondary name along with
חדשׁ, and is described as furnished on the under part of the two arms of
the sledge not only with sharp knives, but with two-edged knives
(פּיפיּות a reduplication, like מאסּאה in [Isa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008.md), whereas מימי is a double
plural). Just like such a threshing machine would Israel thresh and
grind to powder from that time forth both mountains and hills. This is
evidently a figurative expression for proud and mighty foes, just as
wind and tempest denote the irresistible force of Jehovah's aid. The
might of the enemy would be broken down to the very last remnant,
whereas Israel would be able to rejoice and glory in its God.

[Isaiah 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 41:17</span></span>

At the present time, indeed, the state of His people was a helpless one,
but its cry for help was not in vain. "The poor and needy, who seek for
water and there is none, their tongue faints for thirst. I Jehovah will
hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I open streams
upon hills of the field, and springs in the midst of the valleys; I make
the desert into a pond, and dry land into fountains of water. I give in
the desert cedars, acacias, and myrtles, and oleasters; I set in the
steppe cypresses, plane-trees, and sherbin-trees together, that they may
see, and know, and lay to heart and understand all together, that the
hand of Jehovah hath accomplished this, and the Holy One of Israel hath
created it." Kimchi, Hitzig, and others refer these promises to the
returning exiles; but there is also a description, without any
restriction to the return home, of the miraculous change which would
take place in the now comfortless and helpless condition of the exiles.
The shephâyı̄m, i.e., bare, woodless hills rising up from the plain, [Jer
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#012.md), the beqâ‛ōth, or deep valleys,
by the sides of which there rise precipitous mountains, and the 'erets
tsiyyâh, the land of burning heat or drought (cf., [Psa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002).md), depict the homeless condition
of Israel, as it wandered over bald heights and through waterless plains
about a land with parched and gaping soil. For the characteristics of
the object, which is placed before אענם, we may therefore compare such
passages as [Isa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md); [Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md). נשׁתּה is either a pausal form
for נשׁתּה, and therefore the niphal of שׁתת (to set, become shallow,
dry up), or a pausal form for נשׁתה, and therefore the kal of נשׁת with
dagesh affectuosum, like נתנּוּ in [Eze
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#019) (Olshausen, 83, b.md). The form
נשׁתה in [Jer 51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030.md) may just as well
be derived from שׁתת (Ges. 67, Anm. 11) as from נשׁת, whereas נשּׁתוּ
may certainly be taken as the niphal of שׁתת after the form נמּל, נחר
(Ges. 67, Anm. 5), though it would be safer to refer it to a kal נשׁת,
which seems to be also favoured by ינּתשׁוּ in [Jer
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014.md) as a transposition of ינּשׁתוּ.
The root נש, of which נשׁת would be a further expansion, really exhibits
the meaning to dry up or thirst, in the Arabic nassa; whereas the verbs
נוּשׁ, אנשׁ, נסס ([Isa 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018).md), נשׁה,
Syr. nas', nos', Arab. nâsa, nasnasa, with the primary meaning to
slacken, lose their hold, and נשׁא, נשׁה, נסע, to deceive, derange, and
advance, form separate families. Just when they are thus on the point of
pining away, they receive an answer to their prayer: their God opens
streams, i.e., causes streams to break forth on the hills of the field,
and springs in the midst of the valleys. The desert is transformed into
a lake, and the steppe of burning sand into fountains of water. What was
predicted in [Isa 35:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md) is echoed
again here - a figurative representation of the manifold fulness of
refreshing, consolation, and marvellous help which was to burst all at
once upon those who were apparently forsaken of God. What is depicted in
[Isa 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#019.md), [Isa
41:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#020.md), is the effect of these. It is
not merely a scanty vegetation that springs up, but a corresponding
manifold fulness of stately, fragrant, and shady trees; so that the
steppe, where neither foot nor eye could find a resting-place, is
changed, as by a stroke of magic, into a large, dense, well-watered
forest, and shines with sevenfold glory - an image of the many-sided
manifestations of divine grace which are experienced by those who are
comforted now. Isaiah is especially fond of such figures as these (vid.,
[Isa 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md); [Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md); [Isa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006.md); [Isa
37:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#031)). There are seven (4 + 3.md) trees
named; seven indicating the divine character of this manifold
development (Psychol. p. 188). 'Erez is the generic name for the cedar;
shittâh, the acacia, the Egyptian spina (ἄκανθα), Copt. shont; hadas,
the myrtle, ‛ēts shemen, the wild olive, as distinguished from zayith (ἡ
ἀγριέλαιος, opposed to ἡ ἐλαία in [Rom
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017).md); berōsh, the cypress, at any
rate more especially this; tidhâr we have rendered the "plane-tree,"
after Saad.; and te'asshūr the "sherbin" (a kind of cedar), after Saad.
and Syr. The crowded synonyms indicating sensual and spiritual
perception in [Isa 41:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#020.md) (ישׂימוּ, sc.
לבּם, [Isa 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022).md) are meant to express
as strongly as possible the irresistible character of the impression.
They will be quite unable to regard all this as accidental or
self-produced, or as anything but the production of the power and grace
of their God.

[Isaiah 41:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 41:21</span></span>

There follows now the second stage in the suit. "Bring hither your
cause, saith Jehovah; bring forward your proofs, saith the king of
Jacob. Let them bring forward, and make known to us what will happen:
make known the beginning, what it is, and we will fix our heart upon it,
and take knowledge of its issue; or let us hear what is to come. Make
known what is coming later, and we will acknowledge that ye are gods:
yea, do good, and do evil, and we will measure ourselves, and see
together." In the first stage Jehovah appealed, in support of His deity,
to the fact that it was He who had called the oppressor of the nations
upon the arena of history. In this second stage He appeals to the fact
that He only knows or can predict the future. There the challenge was
addressed to the worshippers of idols, here to the idols themselves; but
in both cases both of these are ranged on the one side, and Jehovah with
His people upon the other. It is with purpose that Jehovah is called the
"King of Jacob,"as being the tutelar God of Israel, in contrast to the
tutelar deities of the heathen. The challenge to the latter to establish
their deity is first of all addressed to them directly in [Isa
41:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021.md), and then indirectly in [Isa
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022.md), where Jehovah connects Himself
with His people as the opposing party; but in [Isa
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022.md) He returns again to a direct
address. עצּמות are evidences (lit. robara, cf., ὀχυρώματα, [Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004.md), from עצם, to be strong or
stringent; mishn. נתעצּם, to contend with one another pro et contra);
here it signifies proofs that they can foresee the future. Jehovah for
His part has displayed this knowledge, inasmuch as, at the very time
when He threatened destruction to the heathen at the hands of Cyrus, He
consoled His people with the announcement of their deliverance ([Isa
41:8-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008).md). It is therefore the turn of
the idol deities now: "Let them bring forward and announce to us the
things that will come to pass." the general idea of what is in the
future stands at the head. Then within this the choice is given them of
proving their foreknowledge of what is afterwards to happen, by
announcing either ראשׁנות, or even בּאות. These two ideas, therefore,
are generic terms within the range of the things that are to happen.
Consequently הרשׁנות cannot mean "earlier predictions," prius praedicta,
as Hitzig, Knobel, and others suppose. This explanation is precluded in
the present instance by the logic of the context. Both ideas lie upon
the one line of the future; the one being more immediate, the other more
remote, or as the expression alternating with הבאות implies לאחור
האתיּות, ventura in posterum ("in later times," compare [Isa
42:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#023.md), "at a later period;" from the
participle אתה, radical form אתי, vid., Ges. 75, Anm. 5, probably to
distinguish it from אתות). This is the explanation adopted by Stier and
Hahn, the latter of whom has correctly expounded the word, as denoting
"the events about to happen first in the immediate future, which it is
not so difficult to prognosticate from signs that are discernible in the
present." The choice is given them, either to foretell "things at the
beginning" (haggı̄dū in our editions is erroneously pointed with kadma
instead of geresh), i.e., that which will take place first or next,
"what they be" (quae et qualia sint), so that now, when the achărı̄th,
"the latter end" (i.e., the issue of that which is held out to view), as
prognosticated from the standpoint of the present, really occurs, the
prophetic utterance concerning it may be verified; or "things to come,"
i.e., things further off, in later times (in the remote future), the
prediction of which is incomparably more difficult, because without any
point of contact in the present. They are to choose which they like (או
from אוה, like vel from velle): "ye do good, and do evil," i.e.,
(according to the proverbial use of the phrase; cf., [Zep
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012.md) and [Jer
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005).md) only express yourselves in some
way; come forward, and do either the one or the other. The meaning is,
not that they are to stir themselves and predict either good or evil,
but they are to show some sign of life, no matter what. "And we will
measure ourselves (i.e., look one another in the face, testing and
measuring), and see together," viz., what the result of the contest will
be. השׁתּעה like התראה in [Kg2 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008.md),
[Kg2 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#011.md), with a cohortative âh,
which is rarely met with in connection with verbs ל ה, and the tone upon
the penultimate, the âh being attached without tone to the voluntative
נשׁתּע in [Kg2 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#005) (Ewald, 228, c.md).
For the chethib ונראה, the Keri has the voluntative ונרא.

[Isaiah 41:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 41:24</span></span>

Jehovah has thus placed Himself in opposition to the heathen and their
gods, as the God of history and prophecy. It now remains to be seen
whether the idols will speak, to prove their deity. By no means; not
only are they silent, but they cannot speak. Therefore Jehovah breaks
out into words of wrath and contempt. "Behold, ye are of nothing, and
your doing of nought: an abomination whoever chooseth you." The two מן
are partitive, as in [Isa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017.md); and
מאפע is not an error of the pen for מאפס, as Gesenius and others
suppose, but אפע from עפע = פּה (from which comes פּה), פּעה, [Isa
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014.md) (from which comes אפעה, [Isa
59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005).md), to breathe, stands as a synonym
to און, הבל, רוח. The attributive clause בּכם יבחר (supply אשׁר חוּא) is
a virtual subject (Ewald, 333, b): ye and your doings are equally nil;
and whoever chooses you for protectors, and makes you the objects of his
worship, is morally the most degraded of beings.

[Isaiah 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 41:25</span></span>

The more conclusively and incontrovertibly, therefore, does Jehovah keep
the field as the moulder of history and foreteller of the future, and
therefore as God above all gods. "I have raised up from the north, and
he came: from the rising of the sun one who invokes my name; and he
treads upon satraps as mud, and like a potter kneadeth clay." The object
of the verb hâ‛ı̄rōthı̄ (I have wakened up) is he who came when wakened up
by Jehovah from the north and east, i.e., from Media and Persia (ויּאת =
ויּאתּ for ויּאת, with evasion of the auxiliary pathach, Ges. 76, 2, c),
and, as the second clause affirms, who invokes or will invoke the name
of Jehovah (at any rate, qui invocabit is the real meaning of qui
invocat). For although the Zarathustrian religion, which Cyrus followed,
was nearest to the Jehovah religion of all the systems of heathenism, it
was a heathen religion after all. The doctrine of a great God (baga
vazarka), the Creator of heaven and earth, and at the same time of a
great number of Bagas and Yazatas, behind whose working and worship the
great God was thrown into the shade, is (apart from the dualism
condemned in [Isa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007).md) the substance
of the sacred writings of the Magi in our possession, as confirmed by
the inscriptions of the Achemenides.

(Note: Windischmann, Zoroastrische Studien, pp. 134, 135.)

But the awakened of Jehovah would, as is here predicted, "call with the
name, or by means of the name, of Jehovah," which may mean either call
upon this name ([Zep 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md); [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025).md), or call out the name (compare
[Exo 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019.md); [Exo
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#005.md), with [Exo
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030).md) in the manner in which he does
make use of it in the edict setting the exiles free ([Ezr
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002).md). The verb יבא which follows (cf.,
[Isa 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002).md) designated him still
further as a conqueror of nations; the verb construed with an accusative
is used here, as is very frequently the case, in the sense of hostile
attack. The word Sâgân, which is met with first in Ezekiel - apart, that
is to say, from the passage before us - may have owed its meaning in the
Hebrew vocabulary to its similarity in sound to sōkhēn ([Isa
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015).md); at any rate, it is no doubt a
Persian word, which became naturalized in the Hebrew (ζωγάνης in
Athenaeus, and Neo-Pers. sichne, a governor: see Ges. Thes.), though
this comparison is by no means so certain

(Note: Spiegel has the following remarks upon the subject: There is but
very little probability in the etymologies which can be suggested for
the word sâgân through the help of the old Persian. The new Persian
shihne cannot be traced beyond Neo-Persian, and even there it is
somewhat suspicious on account of the ḥ which it contains, and which is
not Persian. The only real Persian word to which I could think of
tracing it is shahr, a city (old Bactrian khshathra, or shoithra, a
place of abode); or it might possibly have sprung from shoithraka, a
supposititious word, in the sense of governor of a district, but with
the r changed into n (a change which only occurs in Huzvaresh) and the h
into ḥ. There are also difficulties in the comparison of the old
Bactrian canh, to say or express solemnly. An adjective canhâna
(expressing, commanding), formed from this verb, would be pronounced
canhâna or even câna in old Persian; and from this Sâgân would have to
be obtained, so that we should still want the n to take the place of the
Gimel. At the same time, there is a still harsher form of the root canh
in the Gatha dialect, namely cak (not the same as the Sanskrit cak, to
be strong, as Haug supposes), though this comparison is by no means so
certain, from which the Neo-Persian sachan, sachun, a word, is derived;
so that it appears to have been also current in old Persian.
Accordingly, the form cakâna may also have been used in the place of
canhâna, and this might suit in some degree for sâgân.)

as that σατράπης is the same as the Ksatrapâv of the inscriptions, i.e.,
protector of the kingdom.

(Note: See H. Rawlinson, Asiatic Journal, xi. 1, p. 116 ss.; and
Spiegel, Keilinschriften, p. 194.)

Without at all overlooking the fact that this word segânı̄m, so far as it
can really be supposed to be a Persian word, favours the later
composition of this portion of the book of Isaiah, we cannot admit that
it has any decisive weight, inasmuch as the Persian word pardēs occurs
even in the Song of Solomon. And the indications which might be found in
the word segânı̄m unfavourable to Isaiah's authorship are abundantly
counterbalanced by what immediately follows.

[Isaiah 41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 41:26</span></span>

As [Isa 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025.md) points back to the first
charge against the heathen and their gods ([Isa
41:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002).md), so [Isa
41:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026.md) point back to the second. Not
only did Jehovah manifest Himself as the Universal Ruler in the waking
up of Cyrus, but as the Omniscient Ruler also. "Who hath made it known
from the beginning, we will acknowledge it, and from former time, we
will say He is in the right?! Yea, there was none that made known; yea,
none that caused to hear; yea, none that heard your words. As the first
I saith to Zion, Behold, behold, there it is: and I bestow evangelists
upon Jerusalem. And I looked, and there was no man; and of these there
was no one answering whom I would ask, and who would give me an answer."
If any one of the heathen deities had foretold this appearance of Cyrus
so long before as at the very commencement of that course of history
which had thus reached its goal, Jehovah with His people, being thus
taught by experience, would admit and acknowledge their divinity. מראשׁ
is used in the same sense as in [Isa
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016.md) : and also in [Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004.md) and [Isa
40:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#021.md), where it refers according to
the context in each case, to the beginning of the particular line of
history. צדּיק signifies either "he is right," i.e., in the right
(compare the Arabic siddik, genuine), or in a neuter sense, "it is
right" (= true), i.e., the claim to divine honours is really founded
upon divine performances. But there was not one who had proclaimed it,
or who gave a single sound of himself; no one had heard anything of the
kind from them. אין receives a retrospective character from the
connection; and bearing this in mind, the participles may be also
resolved into imperfects. The repeated אף, passing beyond what is set
down as possible, declares the reality of the very opposite. What
Jehovah thus proves the idols to want, He can lay claim to for Himself.
In [Isa 41:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#027.md) we need not assume that
there is any hyperbaton, as Louis de Dieu, Rosenmller, and others have
done: "I first will give to Zion and Jerusalem one bringing glad
tidings: behold, behold them." After what has gone before in [Isa
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026.md) we may easily supply אמרתּי, "I
said," in [Isa 41:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#027.md) (compare [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md); [Isa
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#016.md); [Isa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002).md), not אמר, for the whole
comparison drawn by Jehovah between Himself and the idols is
retrospective, and looks back from the fulfilment in progress to the
prophecies relating to it. The only reply that we can look for to the
question in [Isa 41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026.md) is not, "I on
the contrary do it," but "I did it." At the same time, the rendering is
a correct one: "Behold, behold them" (illa; for the neuter use of the
masculine, compare [Isa 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#003.md); [Isa
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016.md); [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008).md). "As the first," Jehovah replies
(i.e., without any one anticipating me), "Have I spoken to Zion: behold,
behold, there it is," pointing with the finger of prophecy to the coming
salvation, which is here regarded as present; "and I gave to Jerusalem
messengers of joy;" i.e., long ago, before what is now approaching could
be known by any one, I foretold to my church, through the medium of
prophets, the glad tidings of the deliverance from Babylon. If the
author of chapters 40-66 were a prophet of the captivity, his reference
here would be to such prophecies as [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md) (where Shinar is mentioned as a
land of dispersion), and more especially still [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md), "There in Babylon wilt thou be
delivered, there will Jehovah redeem thee out of the hand of thine
enemies;" but if Isaiah were the author, he is looking back from the
ideal standpoint of the time of the captivity, and of Cyrus more
especially, to his own prophecies before the captivity (such as Isaiah
13:1-14:23, and [Isa 21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001).md), just as
Ezekiel, when prophesying of Gog and Magog, looks back in [Isa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017.md) fro the ideal standpoint of this
remote future, more especially to his own prophecies in relation to it.
In that case the mebhassēr, or evangelist, more especially referred to
is the prophet himself (Grotius and Stier), namely, as being the
foreteller of those prophets to whom the commission in [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md), "Comfort ye, comfort ye," is
addressed, and who are greeted in [Isa
52:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md) as the bearers of the joyful
news of the existing fulfilment of the deliverance that has appeared,
and therefore as the mebhassēr or evangelist of the future מבשׂרים. In
any case, it follows from [Isa 41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026.md),
[Isa 41:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#027.md) that the overthrow of
Babylon and the redemption of Israel had long before been proclaimed by
Jehovah through His prophets; and if our exposition is correct so far,
the futures in [Isa 41:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#028.md) are to be
taken as imperfects: And I looked round (וארא, a voluntative in the
hypothetical protasis, Ges. 128, 2), and there was no one (who announced
anything of the kind); and of these (the idols) there was no adviser
(with regard to the future, [Num
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014).md), and none whom I could ask, and
who answered me (the questioner). Consequently, just as the raising up
of Cyrus proclaimed the sole omnipotence of Jehovah, so did the fact
that the deliverance of Zion-Jerusalem, for which the raising up of
Cyrus prepared the way, had been predicted by Him long before, proclaim
His sole omniscience.

[Isaiah 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 41:29</span></span>

This closing declaration of Jehovah terminates with similar words of
wrath and contempt to those with which the judicial process ended in
[Isa 41:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#024.md). "See them all, vanity;
nothingness are their productions, wind and desolation their molten
images." מעשׂיהם are not the works of the idols, but, as the parallel
shows, the productions (plural, as in [Eze
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006.md); [Jer
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016).md) of the idolaters - in other
words, the idols themselves - a parallel expression to נסכּיהם (from
נסך, as in [Isa 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005.md) = massēkhâh, [Isa
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#017).md). אפס און is an emotional
asyndeton (Ges. 155, 1, a). The address is thus rounded off by returning
to the idolaters, with whom it first started. The first part, vv. 1-24,
contains the judicial pleadings; the second part, [Isa
41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025.md)., recapitulates the evidence and
the verdict.
