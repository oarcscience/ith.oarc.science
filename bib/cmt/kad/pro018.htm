<p>This series of proverbs now turns from the fool to the separatist:
<p>The separatist seeketh after his own pleasure;
<p>Against all that is beneficial he showeth his teeth.
<p>The reflexive &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491; has here the same meaning as the Rabbinical &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to separate oneself from the congregation, Aboth ii. 5; &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491; denotes a man who separates himself, for he follows his own counsel, Arab. mnfrd (mtfrrd) bra&#770;yh, or jh&#803;ys almh&#803;h&#803;l (seorsum ab aliis secedens). Instead of &#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, Hitzig, after Jerome, adopts the emendation &#1500;&#1514;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, "after an occasion" (a pretext), and by &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491; thinks of one pushed aside, who, thrown into opposition, seeks to avenge himself. But his translation of 1b, "against all that is fortunate he gnasheth his teeth," shows how much the proverb is opposed to this interpretation. &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491; denotes one who willingly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011">Jdg 4:11</A>), and, indeed, obstinately withdraws himself. The construction of &#1497;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; with &#1500; (also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#006">Job 10:6</A>) is explained by this, that the poet, giving prominence to the object, would set it forward: a pleasure (&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, as Arab. hawan, unstable and causeless direction of the mind to something, pleasure, freak, caprice), and nothing else, he goes after who has separated himself (Fl.); the effort of the separatist goes out after a pleasure, i.e., the enjoyment and realization of such; instead of seeking to conform himself to the law and ordinance of the community, he seeks to carry out a separate view, and to accomplish some darling plan: libidinem sectatur sui cerebri homo. With this 1b accords. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007">Pro 2:7</A>) is concretely that which furthers and profits. Regarding &#1492;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;, vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#014">Pro 17:14</A>. Thus putting his subjectivity in the room of the common weal, he shows his teeth, places himself in fanatical opposition against all that is useful and profitable in the principles and aims, the praxis of the community from which he separates himself. The figure is true to nature: the polemic of the schismatic and the sectary against the existing state of things, is for the most part measureless and hostile.

<p>2 The fool hath no delight in understanding;
<p>   But only that his heart may reveal itself therein.
<p>The verb &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; forms the fut. &#1497;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509; as well as &#1497;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509;; first the latter from &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, with the primary meaning, to bow, to bend down; then both forms as intransitive, to bend oneself to something, to be inclined to something, Arab. 't&#803;f. (Fl.). &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is here the intelligence which consists in the understanding of one's own deficiency, and of that which is necessary to meet it. The inclination of the fool goes not out after such intelligence, but (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;; according to Ben-Naphtali, &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1501;) only that his heart, i.e., the understanding which he thinks that he already possesses, may reveal itself, show itself publicly. He thinks thereby to show himself in his true greatness, and to render a weighty service to the world. This loquacity of the fool, proceeding from self-satisfaction, without self-knowledge, has already, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023">Pro 12:23</A>, and often, been reprimanded. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#003">Proverbs 18:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 18:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The group beginning with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#003">Pro 18:3</A> terminates in two proverbs (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006">Pro 18:6</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#007">Pro 18:7</A>), related to the concluding verse of the foregoing:
<p>3 If a godless man cometh, then cometh also contempt;
<p>   And together with disgrace, shame.
<p>J. D. Michaelis, and the most of modern critics, read &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;; then, contempt etc., are to be thought of as the consequences that follow godlessness; for that &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; means (Hitzig) disgracefulness, i.e., disgraceful conduct, is destitute of proof; &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; always means disgrace as an experience. But not only does the Masoretic text punctuate &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, but also all the old translators, the Greek, Aramaic, and Latin, have done so. And is it on this account, because a coming naturally seems to be spoken of a person? The "pride cometh, then cometh shame," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#002">Pro 11:2</A>, was in their recollection not less firmly, perhaps, than in ours. They read &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, because &#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; does not fittingly designate the first of that which godlessness effects, but perhaps the first of that which proceeds from it. Therefore we adhere to the opinion, that the proverb names the fiends which appear in the company of the godless wherever he goes, viz., first &#1489;&#1493;&#1494;, contempt (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019">Psa 31:19</A>), which places itself haughtily above all due subordination, and reverence, and forbearance; and then, with the disgrace [turpitudo], &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, which attaches itself to those who meddle with him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018">Isa 22:18</A>), there is united the shame, &#1492;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009">Psa 39:9</A>), which he has to suffer from him who has only always expected something better from him. Fleischer understands all the three words in the passive sense, and remarks, "&#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1492;, a more artificial expression for &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; &#1493;&#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1492;, in the Turkish quite common for the copula wa&#772;w, e.g., swylh t&#803;bra&#770;k, earth and water, 'wrtylh a&#770;r, the man and the woman." But then the expression would be tautological; we understand &#1489;&#1493;&#1494; and &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1492; of that which the godless does to others by his words, and &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; of that which he does to them by his conduct. By this interpretation, &#1506;&#1501; is more than the representative of the copula. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#004">Proverbs 18:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">pro 18:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>4 Deep waters are the words from a man's mouth,
<p>   A bubbling brook, a fountain of wisdom.
<p>Earlier, we added to hominis the supplement sc. sapientis, but then an unnecessary word would be used, and that which is necessary omitted. Rather it might be said that &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is meant in an ideal sense; but thus meant, &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, denotes the valiant man, but not man as he ought to be, or the man of honour; and besides, a man may be a man of honour without there being said of him what this proverb expresses. Ewald comes nearer the case when he translates, "deep waters are the heart-words of many." Heart-words - what an unbiblical expression! The lxx, which translates &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;, has not read &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;, but &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1500;&#1489; (as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#005">Pro 20:5</A>, &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1470;). But that "of many" is certainly not a right translation, yet right in so far as &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014">Pro 12:14</A>) is thought of as made prominent: the proverb expresses, in accordance with the form of narrative proverbs which present an example, what occurs in actual life, and is observed. Three different things are said of the words from a man's mouth: they are deep waters, for their meaning does not lie on the surface, but can be perceived only by penetrating into the secret motives and aims of him who speaks; they are a bubbling brook, which freshly and powerfully gushes forth to him who feels this flow of words, for in this brook there never fails an always new gush of living water; it is a fountain or well of wisdom, from which wisdom flows forth, and whence wisdom is to be drawn. Hitzig supposes that the distich is antithetic; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, or rather &#1502;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, "waters of the deep," are cistern waters; on the contrary, "a welling brook is a fountain of wisdom." But &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; means deep, not deepened, and deep water is the contrast of shallow water; a cistern also may be deep (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014">Pro 22:14</A>), but deep water is such as is deep, whether it be in the ocean or in a ditch. 4b also does not suggest a cistern, for thereby it would be indicated that the description, &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1508;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, is not here continued; the "fountain of wisdom" does not form a proper parallel or an antithesis to this subject, since this much rather would require the placing in contrast of deep and shallow, of exhausted (drained out) and perennial. And: the fountain is a brook, the well a stream - who would thus express himself! We have thus neither an antithetic nor a synonymous (lxx after the phrase &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, Jerome, Venet., Luth.), but an integral distich before us; and this leads us to consider what depths of thought, what riches of contents, what power of spiritual and moral advancement, may lie in the words of a man. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005">Proverbs 18:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 18:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>5 To favour the person of the godless is not good,
<p>   And to oppress the righteous in judgment.
<p>As <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#004">Pro 18:4</A> has one subject, so <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005">Pro 18:5</A> has one predicate. The form is the same as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026">Pro 17:26</A>. &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023">Pro 24:23</A>), &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, acceptio personae, is this, that one accepts the &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, i.e. the personal appearance of any one (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;), i.e., regards it as acceptable, respectable, agreeable, which is a thing in itself not wrong; but in a judge who ought to determine according to the facts of the case and the law, it becomes sinful partiality. &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, in a forensic sense, with the accus. of the person, may be regarded in a twofold way: either as a turning aside, &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#002">Isa 10:2</A>, from following and attaining unto the right, or as an oppression, for the phrase &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; [to pervert justice] (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023">Pro 17:23</A>) is transferred to the person who experiences the oppression = perversion of the law; and this idea perhaps always underlies the expression, wherever, as e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005">Mal 3:5</A>, no addition brings with it the other. Under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#015">Pro 17:15</A> is a fuller explanation of &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006">Proverbs 18:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">pro 18:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>6 The lips of the fool engage in strife,
<p>   And his mouth calleth for stripes.
<p>We may translate: the lips of the fool cause strife, for &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;, to come with anything, e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013">Psa 66:13</A>, is equivalent to bring it (to bring forward), as also: they engage in strife; as one says &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;: to be engaged in bloodshed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#026">Sa1 25:26</A>. We prefer this intrant (ingerunt se), with Schultens and Fleischer. &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, a synallage generis, to which, by means of a "self-deception of the language" (Fl.), the apparent masculine ending of such duals may have contributed. The stripes which the fool calleth for (&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1500;, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#003">Pro 2:3</A>) are such as he himself carries off, for it comes a verbis ad verbera. The lxx: his bold mouth calleth for death (&#1508;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;); &#1500;&#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; has, in codd. and old editions, the Mem raphatum, as also at 19:29; the sing. is thus &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, like &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; to &#1502;&#1504;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, for the Mem dagessatum is to be expected in the inflected &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1501;, by the passing over of the o&#772; into u&#780;.

<p>7 The mouth of the fool is to him destruction,

<p>As <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006">Pro 18:6</A> corresponds to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#027">Pro 17:27</A> of the foregoing group, so this <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#007">Pro 18:7</A> corresponds to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#028">Pro 17:28</A>.

Instead of &#1508;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, is to be written &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, according to Torath Emeth, p. 40, Cod. 1294, and old editions. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008">Proverbs 18:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 18:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A pair of proverbs regarding the flatterer and the slothful:
<p>8 The words of the flatter are as dainty morsels,
<p>   And they glide down into the innermost parts.
<p>An "analogy, with an epexegesis in the second member" (Fl.), which is repeated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#022">Pro 26:22</A>. Ewald, Bertheau, Hitzig, and others, are constrained to interpret &#1492;&#1502;&#1493; as introducing a contrast, and in this sense they give to &#1502;&#1514;&#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; all kinds of unwarrantable meanings. Ewald translates: a burning (&#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, cogn. &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;), and offers next: as whispering (&#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, cogn. &#1512;&#1506;&#1501;, &#1504;&#1492;&#1501;); Ch. B. Michaelis, Bertheau, and others: as sporting (&#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, cogn. &#1500;&#1492;&#1492;); Hitzig: like soft airs (&#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, cogn. Arab. hillam, flaccus, laxus). All these interpretations are without support. The word &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; has none of all these significations; it means, as the Arab. lahima warrants, deglutire. But Bttcher's explanation also: "as swallowed down, because spoken with reserve," proceeds, like those others, from the supposed syntactically fine yet false supposition, that 8b is an antithetic "dennoch" [tamen]. In that case the poet would have written &#1493;&#1492;&#1501; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, as the beginning of a conditional clause, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029">Pro 3:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#003">Pro 23:3</A>). But &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, &#1493;&#1492;&#1501;, with the finite following, introduces neither here nor at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003">Deu 33:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#034">Jdg 20:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010">Psa 95:10</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#023">Gen 43:23</A>, a conditional clause. Thus 8b continues the clause 8a by one standing on the same line; and thus we do not need to invent a meaning for &#1499;&#1502;&#1514;&#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, which forms a contrast to the penetrating into the innermost parts. The relation of the parts of the proverb is rightly given by Luther:
<p>The words of the slanderer are stripes,
<p>And they go through the heart of one.
<p>He interprets &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; as transposed from &#1492;&#1500;&#1501; (Rashi and others); but stripes cannot be called &#1502;&#1514;&#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; - they are called, 6b, &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;. This interpretation of the word has always more support than that of Symmachus: &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;; Jerome: quasi simplicia; Aquila, xxvi. 22: &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;; which last, as also that of Capellus, Clericus, and Schultens: quasi numine quodam afflata, seems to support itself on the Arab. a&#770;hm iv. inspirare. But in reality a&#770;hm does not mean afflare; it means deglutire, and nothing else. The Jewish lexicographers offer nothing worth considering; Kimchi's &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, according to which the Venet. translates &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, is fanciful; for the Talm. &#1492;&#1500;&#1501;, striking = hitting, suitable, standing well, furnishes no transition to "smooth" and "soft." Immanuel compares a&#770;hm = &#1489;&#1500;&#1506;; and Schultens, who is followed by Gesenius and others, has already, with perfect correctness, explained: tanquam quae avidissime inglutiantur. Thus also Fleischer: things which offer themselves to be eagerly gulped down, or which let themselves be thus swallowed. But in this way can one be truly just to the Hithpa.? The Arab. a&#770;lthm (stronger form, a&#770;ltkm, according to which van Dyk translates mthl uk&#803;am h&#803;lwt, like sweet morsels) means to swallow into oneself, which is not here appropriate. The Hithpa. will thus have here a passive signification: things which are greedily swallowed. Regarding &#1504;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503; from &#1512;&#1490;&#1503;, vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#028">Pro 16:28</A>. &#1492;&#1502;&#1493; refers to the words of the flatterer, and is emphatic, equivalent to aeque illa, etiam illa, or illa ipsa. &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; is here connected with the obj. accus. (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#012">Pro 1:12</A>) instead of with &#1488;&#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027">Pro 7:27</A>. &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;, penetralia, we had already at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027">Pro 7:27</A>; the root-word is (Arab.) khdr, to seclude, to conceal, different from h&#803;dr, demittere, and h&#803;khr (cogn. &#1495;&#1494;&#1512;), to finish, circumire. &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; is the inner part of the body with reference to the organs lying there, which mediate not only the life of the body, but also that of the mind - in general, the internal part of the personality. The lxx does not translate this proverb, but has in its stead <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#015">Pro 19:15</A>, in a different version, however, from that it gives there; the Syr. and the Targ. have thereby been drawn away from the Hebr. text.

<p>9 He also who showeth himself slothful in his business,
<p>   Is a brother to him who proceedeth to destroy.
<p>The Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; signifies here, as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#010">Pro 24:10</A>, to show oneself slack, lazy, negligent. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; is properly a commission for another, as a king has a messenger, ambassador, commissioner to execute it; here, any business, whether an undertaking in commission from another, or a matter one engages in for himself. He who shows himself slack therein, produces in his way, viz., by negligence, destruction, as truly as the &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, who does it directly by his conduct. Thus one is named, who is called, or who has his own delight in it, to destroy or overthrow. Jerome, incorrectly limiting: sua opera dissipantis. Hitzig well compares <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#030">Mat 12:30</A>. In the variation, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#024">Pro 28:24</A>, the destroyer is called &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, the connection of the words being adject.; on the contrary, the connection of &#1489;&#1506;&#1500; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; is genit. (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024">Pro 22:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#002">Pro 23:2</A>, etc.), for &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; as frequently means that which destroys = destruction. Von Hofmann (Schriftbew. ii. 2, 403) understands '&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502; of the street robber, '&#1489;&#1506;&#1500; &#1502; of the captain of robbers; but the designation for the latter must be '&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1502;, though at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#024">Kg1 11:24</A> he is called by the name &#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;. The form of the word in the proverb here is more original than at 38:24. There &#1495;&#1489;&#1512; [companion] is used, here &#1488;&#1495; [brother], a general Semitic name of him who, or of that which, is in any way related to another, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029">Job 30:29</A>. Fleischer compares the Arab. proverb: a&#770;lshbht a&#770;kht alkht&#803;ya&#770;t, scepticism is the sister of sin.

<p>Two proverbs, of the fortress of faith, and of the fortress of presumption:
<p>10 A strong tower is the name of Jahve;
<p>     The righteous runneth into it, and is high.
<p>The name of Jahve is the Revelation of God, and the God of Revelation Himself, the creative and historical Revelation, and who is always continually revealing Himself; His name is His nature representing itself, and therefore capable of being described and named, before all the Tetragramm, as the Anagramm of the overruling and inworking historical being of God, as the Chiffre of His free and all-powerful government in grace and truth, as the self-naming of God the Saviour. This name, which is afterwards interwoven in the name Jesus, is &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004">Psa 61:4</A>), a strong high tower bidding defiance to every hostile assault. Into this the righteous runneth, to hide himself behind its walls, and is thus lifted (perf. consec.) high above all danger (cf. &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#025">Pro 29:25</A>). &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; &#1488;&#1500; means, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#026">Job 15:26</A>, to run against anything, &#1512;&#1493;&#1509;, seq. acc., to invest, blockade anything, &#1512;&#1493;&#1509; &#1489;&#1468;, to hasten within; Hitzig's conjecture, &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; riseth up high, instead of &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, is a freak. &#1512;&#1493;&#1509; &#1489;&#1468; is speedily &#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;, the idea the same as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005">Psa 27:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021">Psa 31:21</A>.

<p>11 The possession of the righteous is his strong fort,
<p>     And is like a high wall in his imagination.

Translators from the lxx to Luther incorrectly think on &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1498; (&#1505;&#1499;&#1498;), to entertain; only the Venet. is correct in the rendering: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; better than Kimchi, who, after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#012">Ezr 8:12</A>, thinks on the chamber where the riches delighted in are treasured, and where he fancies himself in the midst of his treasures as if surrounded by an inaccessible wall.

<p>We place together <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012">Pro 18:12-19</A>, in which the figure of a secure fortress returns:
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012">Pro 18:12</A>
<p>This proverb is connected with the preceding of the rich man who trusts in his mammon.
<p>Before destruction the heat of man is haughty;
<p>And humility goeth before honour.
<p>Line first is a variation of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#018">Pro 16:18</A>, and line second is similar to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033">Pro 15:33</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#013">Pro 18:13</A>
<p>13 If one giveth an answer before he heareth,
<p>     It is to him as folly and shame.
<p>The part. stands here differently from what it does at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#018">Pro 13:18</A>, where it is subj., and at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#014">Pro 17:14</A>, where it is pred. of a simple sentence; it is also here, along with what appertains to it in accordance with the Semitic idiom, subj. to 13b (one who answers ... is one to whom this...); but, in accordance with our idiom, it becomes a hypothetical antecedent. For "to answer" one also uses &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; without addition; but the original full expression is &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, reddere verbum, referre dictum (cf. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#020">Jer 44:20</A>, absol. in the cogn., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#028">Pro 15:28</A>); &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; one may not understand of the word to which, but of the word with which, the reply is made. &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1500;&#1493; comprehends the meaning: it avails to him (ducitur ei), as well as it reaches to him (est ei). In Agricola's Fnfhundert Sprchen this proverb is given thus: Wer antwortet ehe er hret, der zaiget an sein torhait und wirdt ze schanden [he who answers before he hears shows his folly, and it is to him a shame]. But that would require the word to be &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, pudefiet; (&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1500;&#1493;) &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; means that it becomes to him a ground of merited disgrace. "&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, properly wounding, i.e., shame (like atteinte  son honneur), from &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; (cogn. &#1492;&#1500;&#1501;), to strike, hit, wound" (Fl.). Sirach (11:8) warns against such rash talking, as well as against the rudeness of interrupting others.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#014">Pro 18:14</A>
<p>14 The spirit of a man beareth his sickness;
<p>     But a broken spirit, who can bear it?
<p>The breath of the Creator imparting life to man is spoken of as spiritus spirans, &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), and as spiritus spiratus, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;); the spirit (animus) is the primary, and the soul (anima) the secondary principle of life; the double gender of &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; is accounted for thus: when it is thought of as the primary, and thus in a certain degree (vid., Psychol. p. 103ff.) the manly principle, it is mas. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003">Gen 6:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012">Psa 51:12</A>, etc.). Here the change of gender is in the highest degree characteristic, and &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; also is intentionally used (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#015">Sa1 26:15</A>) instead of &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, 16a: the courageous spirit of a man which sustains or endures (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; R. &#1499;&#1500;, comprehendere, prehendere; Luther, "who knows how to contain himself in his sufferings;" cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012">Psa 51:12</A>, "may the free Spirit hold me") the sickness [Siechthum] (we understand here "siech" in the old meaning = sick) with self-control, is generis masculini; while, on the contrary, the &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;&#1492; (as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013">Pro 15:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#022">Pro 17:22</A>), brought down from its manliness and superiority to disheartened passivity, is genere feminino (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012">Psa 51:12</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019">Pro 18:19</A>). Fleischer compares the Arab. proverb, thba&#770;t a&#770;lnfs ba&#770;lghdha&#770; thba&#770;t alrwh balghna&#770;, the soul has firmness by nourishment, the spirit by music.
<p>(Note: In the Arab. language, influenced by philosophy, rwh, the anima vitalis, and nfs, the anima rationalis, are inverted; vid., Baudissin's Translationis antiquae Arab. libri Jobi quae supersunt (1870), p. 34.)
<p>The question &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050">Mar 9:50</A> : if the salt becomes tasteless, wherewith shall one season it? There is no seasoning for the spice that has become insipid. And for the spirit which is destined to bear the life and fortune of the person, if it is cast down by sufferings, there is no one to lift it up and sustain it. But is not God the Most High the lifter up and the bearer of the human spirit that has been crushed and broken? The answer is, that the manly spirit, 14a, is represented as strong in God; the discouraged, 14b, as not drawing from God the strength and support he ought to do. But passages such as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002">Isa 66:2</A> do not bring it near that we think of the &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;&#1492; as alienated from God. The spirit is &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, the bearer of the personal and natural life with its functions, activities, and experiences. If the spirit is borne down to powerless and helpless passivity, then within the sphere of the human personality there is no other sustaining power that can supply its place.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#015">Pro 18:15</A>
<p>15 The heart of a man of understanding gaineth knowledge,
<p>     And the ear of the wise seeketh after knowledge.
<p>&#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503; may be also interpreted as an adj., but we translate it here as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#033">Pro 14:33</A>, because thus it corresponds with the parallelism; cf. &#1500;&#1489; &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#028">Pro 15:28</A>, and &#1500;&#1489; &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#023">Pro 16:23</A>, where the adject. interpretation is excluded. The gaining of wisdom is, after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#016">Pro 17:16</A>, referred to the heart: a heart vigorous in embracing and receiving it is above all necessary, and just such an one possesses the &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;, which knows how to value the worth and usefulness of such knowledge. The wise, who are already in possession of such knowledge, are yet at the same time constantly striving to increase this knowledge: their ear seeks knowledge, eagerly asking where it is to be found, and attentively listening when the opportunity is given of &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, obtaining it.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#016">Pro 18:16</A>
<p>16 The gift of a man maketh room for him,
<p>     And bringeth him before the great.
<p>That &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; may signify intellectual endowments, Hitzig supposes, but without any proof for such an opinion. Intellectual ability as the means of advancement is otherwise designated, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029">Pro 22:29</A>. But Hitzig is right in this, that one mistakes the meaning of the proverb if he interprets &#1502;&#1514;&#1503; in the sense of &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1491; (vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008">Pro 17:8</A>): mtn is an indifferent idea, and the proverb means that a man makes free space, a free path for himself, by a gift, i.e., by this, that he shows himself to be agreeable, pleasing where it avails, not niggardly but liberal. As a proverb expresses it:
<p>Mit dem Hut in der Hand
<p>Kommt man durchs ganze Land
<p>[with hat in hand one goes through the whole land], so it is said here that such liberality brings before the great, i.e., not: furnishes with introductions to them; but helps to a place of honour near the great, i.e., those in a lofty position (cf. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029">Pro 22:29</A>; &#1506;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008">Psa 113:8</A>). It is an important part of practical wisdom, that by right liberality, i.e., by liberal giving where duty demands it, and prudence commends it, one does not lose but gains, does not descend but rises; it helps a man over the difficulties of limited, narrow circumstances, gains for him affection, and helps him up from step to step. The a&#772; of &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is, in a singular way (cf. &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;), treated as unchangeable.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017">Pro 18:17</A>
<p>17 He that is first in his controversy is right;
<p>     But there cometh another and searcheth him thoroughly - 
<p>an exhortation to be cautious in a lawsuit, and not to justify without more ado him who first brings forward his cause, and supports it by reasons, since, if the second party afterwards search into the reasons of the first, they show themselves untenable. &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493; are to be taken together; the words are equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493; &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;: qui prior cum causa sua venit, i.e., eam ad judicem defert (Fl.). &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; may, however, also of itself alone be qui prior venit; and &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493; will be taken with &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;: justus qui prior venit in causa sua (esse videtur). The accentuation rightly leaves the relation undecided. Instead of &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; (&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;) the Ker&#305;&#770; has &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;, as it elsewhere, at one time, changes the fut. into the perf. with &#1493; (e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#004">Pro 20:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#021">Jer 6:21</A>); and, at another time, the perf. with &#1493; into the fut. (e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010">Psa 10:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#029">Isa 5:29</A>).

Here it is the lot which, as the judgment of God, brings about peace, instead of the ultima ratio of physical force.

<p>19 A brother toward whom it has been acted perfidiously resists more than a strong tower;
<p>     And contentions are like the bar of a palace.
<p>Luther rightly regarded the word &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, according to which the lxx, Vulg., and Syr. translated frater qui adjuvatur a fratre, as an incorrect reading; one would rather expect &#1488;&#1495; &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;, "a brother who stands by," as Luther earlier translated; and besides, &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; does not properly mean adjuvari, but salvari. His translation - 
<p>Ein verletzt Bruder helt herter denn eine feste Stad,
<p>Und Zanck helt herter, denn rigel am Palast
<p>[a brother wounded resisteth more than a strong city, and strife resisteth more than bolts in the palace], is one of his most happy renderings. &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; in itself only means &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; (Venet.); the noun-adjective (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010">Isa 10:10</A>) to be supplied is to be understood to &#1506;&#1494;: &#1506;&#1494; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; or &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; (Kimchi). The Niph. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; occurs only here. If one reads &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, then it means one who is treated falsely = &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, like the frequently occurring &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;, my rising up ones = &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, those that rise up against me; but Codd. (Also Baer's Cod. jaman.) and old editions have &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, which, as we have above translated, gives an impersonal attributive clause; the former: frater perfidiose tractatus (Fl.: mala fide offensus); the latter: perfide actum est, scil. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; in eum = in quem perfide actum. &#1488;&#1495; is, after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017">Pro 17:17</A>, a friend in the highest sense of the word; &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; means to break off, to break free, with &#1489; or &#1506;&#1500; of him on whom the action terminates. That the &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is to be thought of as &#1488;&#1495; of the &#1488;&#1495; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is obvious; the translation, "brothers who break with one another" (Gesen.), is incorrect: &#1488;&#1495; is not collective, and still less is &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; a reciprocum. The relation of &#1488;&#1495; is the same as that of &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#028">Pro 16:28</A>. The Targum (improving the Peshito) translates &#1488;&#1495;&#1488; &#1491;&#1502;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1497; &#1502;&#1503; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1497;, which does not mean: a brother who renounces (Hitzig), but who is treated wickedly on the part of, his brother. That is correct; on the contrary, Ewald's "a brother resists more than..." proceeds from a meaning of &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; which it has not; and Bertheau gives, with Schultens, an untenable
<p>(Note: Among the whole Heb. synon. for sinning, there exists no reflexive Niph.; and also the Arab. fsk&#803; has no ethical signification. &#1504;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; only, in the sense of fool, is found.)
<p>reflexive meaning to the Niph. (which as denom. might mean "covered with crime," Venet. &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;), and, moreover, one that is too weak, for he translates, "a brother is more obstinate then...." Hitzig corrects &#1488;&#1495;&#1494; &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, to shut up sin = to hold it fettered; but that is not correct Heb. It ought to be &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, or &#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;. In 19a the force of the substantival clause lies in the &#1502;&#1503; (more than, i.e., harder = more difficult to be gained), and in 19b in the &#1499;&#1468;; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004">Mic 7:4</A>, where they are interchanged. The parallelism is synonymous: strifes and lawsuits between those who had been friends form as insurmountable a hindrance to their reconciliation, are as difficult to be raised, as the great bars at the gate of a castle (Fl.). The point of comparison is not only the weight of the cross-beam (from &#1489;&#1512;&#1495;, crosswise, across, to go across the field), but also the shutting up of the access. Strife forms a partition wall between such as once stood near each other, and so much thicker the closer they once stood.

<p>21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue;
<p>     And whoever loveth it shall eat its fruit.
<p>The hand, &#1497;&#1491;, is so common a metaphor for power, that as here a hand is attributed to the tongue, so e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#014">Isa 47:14</A> to the flame, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016">Psa 49:16</A> to Hades. Death and life is the great alternative which is placed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015">Deu 30:15</A>, before man. According as he uses his tongue, he falls under the power of death or attains to life. All interpreters attribute, 21b, &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; to the tongue: qui eam (linguam) amant vescentur (&#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, distrib. sing., as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018">Pro 3:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035">Pro 3:35</A>, etc.) fructu ejus. But "to love the tongue" is a strange and obscure expression. He loves the tongue, says Hitzig, who loves to babble. Euchel: he who guards it carefully, or: he who takes care of it, i.e., who applies himself to right discourse. Combining both, Zckler: who uses it much, as &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; or &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. The lxx translates, &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, i.e., &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1492;; but &#1488;&#1495;&#1494; means prehendere and tenere, not cohibere, and the tongue kept in restraint brings forth indeed no bad fruit, but it brings no fruit at all. Why thus? Does the suffix of &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;, perhaps like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017">Pro 8:17</A>, Cheth&#305;&#770;b, refer to wisdom, which, it is true, is not named, but which lies everywhere before the poet's mind?

<p>23 The poor uttereth suppliant entreaties;
<p>     And the rich answereth rudenesses.
<p>The oriental proverbial poetry furnishes many parallels to this. It delights in the description of the contrast between a suppliant poor man and the proud and avaricious rich man; vid., e.g., Samachschari's Goldene Halsbnder, No. 58. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, according to its meaning, refers to the Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503;, misericordiam alicujus pro se imploravit; cf. the old vulgar "barmen," i.e., to seek to move others to Erbarmen [compassion] (&#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;). &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, dura, from &#1506;&#1494; (synon. &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;), hard, fast, of bodies, and figuratively of an unbending, hard, haughty disposition, and thence of words of such a nature (Fl.). Both nouns are accus. of the object, as Job 40:27, &#1514;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; with the parallel &#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;. The proverb expresses a fact of experience as a consolation to the poor to whom, if a rich man insults him, nothing unusual occurs, and as a warning to the rich that he may not permit himself to be divested of humanity by mammon. A hard wedge to a hard clod; but whoever, as the Scripture saith, grindeth the poor by hard stubborn-hearted conduct, and grindeth his bashful face (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#015">Isa 3:15</A>), challenges unmerciful judgment against himself; for the merciful, only they shall obtain mercy, &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007">Mat 5:7</A>).

<p>24 A man of many friends cometh off a loser;
<p>     But there is a friend more faithful than a brother.
<p>Jerome translates the commencing word by vir, but the Syr., Targ. by &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;, which is adopted by Hitzig, Bttcher, and others. But will a German poet use in one line "itzt" [same as jetzt = now], and in the next "jetzt"? and could the Hebrew poet prefer to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; its rarer, and her especially not altogether unambiguous form &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (cf. to the contrary, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015">Ecc 7:15</A>)? We write &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, because the Masora comprehends this passage, with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#019">Sa2 14:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010">Mic 6:10</A>, as the &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; '&#1490;, i.e., as the three, where one ought to expect &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, and is thus exposed to the danger of falling into error in writing and reading; but erroneously &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is found in all these three places in the Masora magna of the Venetian Bible of 1526; elsewhere the Masora has the defectiva scriptio with like meaning only in those two other passages. While &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; = &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, or properly &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, with equal possibility of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;,
<p>(Note: One sees from this interchange how softly the &#1497; was uttered; cf. Wellhausen's Text der B. Samuel (1871) (Preface). Kimchi remarks that we say &#1488;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500; for &#1488;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;, because we would otherwise confound it with &#1497;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;.)
<p>and it makes no material difference in the meaning of 24a whether we explain: there are friends who serve to bring one to loss: or a man of many friends comes to loss, - the inf. with &#1500; is used in substantival clauses as the expression of the most manifold relations, Gesen. 132, Anm. 1 (cf. at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017">Hab 1:17</A>), here in both cases it denotes the end, as e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008">Psa 92:8</A>, to which it hastens with many friends, or with the man of many friends. It is true that &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;) is almost always connected only with genitives of things; but as one says &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;: a man belongs to God, so may one also say &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;: a man belongs to many friends; the common language of the people may thus have named a man, to whom, because he has no definite and decided character, the rule that one knows a man by his friends is not applicable, a so-called every-man's-friend, or all-the-world's-friend. Theodotion translates &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; and thus also the Syr., Targ., and Jerome render (and among the moderns, Hitzig) &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1506;&#1506; as reflexive in the sense of to cherish social intercourse; but this reflexive is &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024">Pro 22:24</A>. That &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506; is either Hithpa. of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, to exult, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#010">Psa 60:10</A>; 65:14, according to which the Venet. translates (contrary to Kimchi) &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;: such an one can exult, but which is not true, since, according to 24b, a true friend outweighs the many; or it is Hithpa. of &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, to be wicked, sinful (Fl.: sibi perniciem paraturus est); or, which we prefer, warranted by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#019">Isa 24:19</A>, of &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, to become brittle (Bttcher and others) - which not only gives a good sense, but also a similar alliteration with &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029">Pro 3:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020">Pro 13:20</A>. In contradistinction to &#1512;&#1506;, which is a general, and, according to the usage of the language (e.g., 17b), a familiar idea, the true friend is called, in the antithetical parallel member, &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006">Pro 27:6</A>); and after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017">Pro 17:17</A>, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511; &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;, one who remains true in misfortune. To have such an one is better than to have many of the so-called friends; and, as appears from the contrast, to him who is so fortunate as to have one such friend, there comes a blessing and safety. Immanuel has given the right explanation: "A man who sets himself to gain many friends comes finally to be a loser (&#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;), for he squanders his means, and is impoverished in favour of others." And Schultens: At est amicus agglutinatus prae fratre. Rarum et carum esse genus insinuatur, ac proinde intimam illam amicitiam, quae conglutinet compingatque corda, non per multos spargendam, sed circumspecte et ferme cum uno tantum ineundam. Thus closes this group of proverbs with the praise of friendship deepened into spiritual brotherhood, as the preceding, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019">Pro 18:19</A>, with a warning against the destruction of such a relation by a breach of trust not to be made good again.
