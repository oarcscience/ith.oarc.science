### [Exodus Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 13:1</span></span>

Sanctification of the first-born, and Promulgation of the Law for the
Feast of Mazzoth. - [Exo 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#001.md), [Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md). The sanctification of the
first-born was closely connected with the Passover. By this the
deliverance of the Israelitish first-born was effected, and the object
of this deliverance was their sanctification. Because Jehovah had
delivered the first-born of Israel, they were to be sanctified to Him.
If the Israelites completed their communion with Jehovah in the
Passover, and celebrated the commencement of their divine standing in
the feast of unleavened bread, they gave uninterrupted effect to their
divine sonship in the sanctification of the first-born. For this reason,
probably, the sanctification of the first-born was commanded by Jehovah
at Succoth, immediately after the exodus, and contemporaneously with the
institution of the seven days' feast of Mazzoth (cf. [Exo
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015).md), so that the place assigned it
in the historical record is the correct one; whereas the divine
appointment of the feast of Mazzoth had been mentioned before ([Exo
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015)..md), and the communication of that
appointment to the people was all that remained to be mentioned here.

[Exo 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md)

Every first-born of man and beast was to be sanctified to Jehovah, i.e.,
given up to Him for His service. As the expression, "all the
first-born," applied to both man and beast, the explanation is added,
"everything that opens the womb among the Israelites, of man and beast."
כּל־רחם פּטר for רחם כּל־פּטת ([Exo
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012).md): כּל is placed like an
adjective after the noun, as in [Num
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#016.md), כּל בּכור for בּכור־כּל,
διανοῖγον πᾶσαν μήτραν for πᾶν διανοῖγον μήτραν ([Exo
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012), lxx.md). הוּא לי: "it is Mine," it
belongs to Me. This right to the first-born was not founded upon the
fact, that "Jehovah was the Lord and Creator of all things, and as every
created object owed its life to Him, to Him should its life be entirely
devoted," as Kurtz maintains, though without scriptural proof; but in
[Num 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#013.md) and [Num
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#017.md) the ground of the claim is
expressly mentioned, viz., that on the day when Jehovah smote all the
first-born of Egypt, He sanctified to Himself all the first-born of the
Israelites, both of man and beast. Hence the sanctification of the
first-born rested not upon the deliverance of the first-born sons from
the stroke of the destroyer through the atoning blood of the paschal
lamb, but upon the fact that God sanctified them for Himself at that
time, and therefore delivered them. But Jehovah sanctified the
first-born of Israel to Himself by adopting Israel as His first-born son
([Exo 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022).md), or as His possession.
Because Israel had been chosen as the nation of Jehovah, its first-born
of man and beast were spared, and for that reason they were henceforth
to be sanctified to Jehovah. In what way, is more clearly defined in
[Num 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#012.md).

[Exo 13:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#003.md)

The directions as to the seven days' feast of unleavened bread ([Exo
12:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015).md) were made known by Moses to
the people on the day of the exodus, at the first station, namely,
Succoth; but in the account of this, only the most important points are
repeated, and the yearly commemoration is enjoined. In [Exo
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#003.md), Egypt is called a "slave-house,"
inasmuch as Israel was employed in slave-labour there, and treated as a
slave population (cf. [Exo 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002.md); [Deu
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#006.md); [Deu
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#012), etc..md). יד הזק "strength of
hand," in [Exo 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#003.md), [Exo
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#014.md), and [Exo
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#016.md), is more emphatic than the more
usual חזקה יד ([Exo 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#019), etc..md). - On
[Exo 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#005.md), see [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md), and [Exo
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#025.md). In [Exo
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#006.md), the term "feast to Jehovah"
points to the keeping of the seventh day by a holy convocation and the
suspension of work ([Exo 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016).md). It is
only of the seventh day that this is expressly stated, because it was
understood as a matter of course, that the first was a feast of Jehovah.

[Exo 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#008.md)

"because of that which Jehovah did to me" (זה in a relative sense, is
qui, for אשׁר, see Ewald, 331): sc., "I eat unleavened bread," or, "I
observe this service." This completion of the imperfect sentence follows
readily from the context, and the whole verse may be explained from [Exo
12:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#026.md).

[Exo 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009.md)

The festival prescribed was to be to Israel "for a sign upon its hand,
and for a memorial between the eyes." These words presuppose the custom
of wearing mnemonic signs upon the hand and forehead; but they are not
to be traced to the heathen custom of branding soldiers and slaves with
marks upon the hand and forehead. For the parallel passages in [Deu
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008.md) and [Deu
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018.md), "bind them for a sign upon your
hand," are proofs that the allusion is neither to branding nor writing
on the hand. Hence the sign upon the hand probably consisted of a
bracelet round the wrist, and the ziccaron between the eyes, of a band
worn upon the forehead. The words are then used figuratively, as a
proverbial expression employed to give emphasis to the injunction to
bear this precept continually in mind, to be always mindful to observe
it. This is still more apparent from the reason assigned, "that the law
of Jehovah may be in thy mouth." For it was not by mnemonic slips upon
the hand and forehead that a law was so placed in the mouth as to be
talked of continually ([Deu 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md); [Deu
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#019).md), but by the reception of it
into the heart and its continual fulfilment. (See also [Exo
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#016)..md) As the origin and meaning of
the festival were to be talked of in connection with the eating of
unleavened bread, so conversation about the law of Jehovah was
introduced at the same time, and the obligation to keep it renewed and
brought vividly to mind.

[Exo 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#010.md)

This ordinance the Israelites were to keep למועדהּ, "at its appointed
time" (i.e., from the 15th to the 21st Abib), - "from days to days,"
i.e., as often as the days returned, therefore from year to year (cf.
[Jdg 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#040.md); [Jdg
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019.md); [Sa1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003.md); [Sa1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#019).md).

[Exo 13:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#011.md)

In [Exo 13:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#011.md), Moses communicated
to the people the law briefly noticed in [Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md), respecting the sanctification of
the first-born. This law was to come into force when Israel had taken
possession of the promised land. Then everything which opened the womb
was to be given up to the Lord. ליהוה העביר: to cause to pass over to
Jehovah, to consecrate or give up to Him as a sacrifice (cf. [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021).md). In "all that openeth the womb"
the first-born of both man and beast are included ([Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002).md). This general expression is then
particularized in three clauses, commencing with וכל: (a) בּהמה cattle,
i.e., oxen, sheep, and goats, as clean domestic animals, but only the
males; (b) asses, as the most common of the unclean domestic animals,
instead of the whole of these animals, [Num
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015); (c.md) the first-born of the
children of Israel. The female first-born of man and beast were exempted
from consecration. Of the clean animals the first-born male (פּטר
abbreviated from רחם פּטר, and שׁגר from the Chaldee שׁגר to throw, the
dropped young one) was to belong to Jehovah, i.e., to be sacrificed to
Him ([Exo 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#015.md), and [Num
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#017).md). This law is still further
explained in [Exo 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029.md), where it is
stated that the sacrificing was not to take place till the eighth day
after the birth; and in [Deu 15:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#021.md),
it is still further modified by the command, that an animal which had
any fault, and was either blind or lame, was not to be sacrificed, but
to be slain and eaten at home, like other edible animals. These two
rules sprang out of the general instructions concerning the sacrificial
animals. The first-born of the ass was to be redeemed with a male lamb
or kid (שׂה, as at [Exo 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003).md); and if
not redeemed, it was to be killed. ערף: from ערף the nape, to break the
neck ([Deu 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#004.md), [Deu
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#006).md). The first-born sons of Israel
were also to be consecrated to Jehovah as a sacrifice; not indeed in the
manner of the heathen, by slaying and burning upon the altar, but by
presenting them to the Lord as living sacrifices, devoting all their
powers of body and mind to His service. Inasmuch as the first birth
represented all the births, the whole nation was to consecrate itself to
Jehovah, and present itself as a priestly nation in the consecration of
the first-born. But since this consecration had its foundation, not in
nature, but in the grace of its call, the sanctification of the first
birth cannot be deduced from the separation of the first-born to the
priesthood. This view, which was very prevalent among early writers, has
been thoroughly overthrown by Outram (de Sacrif. 1, c. 4) and Vitringa
(observv. ii. c. 2, pp. 272ff.). As the priestly character of the nation
did not give a title in itself to the administration of the priesthood
within the theocracy, so the first-born were not eo ipso chosen as
priests through their consecration to Jehovah. In what way they were to
consecrate their life to the Lord, depended upon the appointment of the
Lord, which was, that they were to perform the non-priestly work of the
sanctuary, to be servants of the priests in their holy service. Even
this work was afterwards transferred to the Levites (Num 3). At the same
time the obligation was imposed upon the people to redeem their
first-born sons from the service which was binding upon them, but was
now transferred to the Levites, who were substituted for them; in other
words, to pay five shekels of silver per head to the priesthood ([Num
3:47](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#047.md); [Num
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016).md). In anticipation of this
arrangement, which was to be introduced afterwards, the redemption
(פּדה) of the male first-born is already established here. - On [Exo
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#014.md), see [Exo
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#026.md). מחר: to-morrow, for the future
generally, as in [Gen 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#033.md). מה־זאת:
what does this mean? quid sibi vult hoc praeceptum ac primogenitura
(Jonathan).

[Exo 13:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#015.md)

לשׁלּחנוּ הקשׁה: "he made hard" (sc., his heart, cf. [Exo
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003).md) "to let us go." The
sanctification of the first-born is enforced in [Exo
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#016.md) in the same terms as the keeping
of the feast of Mazzoth in [Exo 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009.md),
with this exception, that instead of לזכרון we have לטוטפת, as in [Deu
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008.md), and [Deu
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018.md). The word טוטפת signifies
neither amulet nor στίγματα, but "binding" or headbands, as is evident
from the Chaldee טוטפא armlet ([Sa2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#010).md), טוטפתּא tiara ([Est
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015.md); [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017.md), [Eze
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#023).md). This command was interpreted
literally by the Talmudists, and the use of tephillim, phylacteries
([Mat 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005).md), founded upon it;

(Note: Possibly these scrolls were originally nothing more than a
literal compliance with the figurative expression, or a change of the
figure into a symbol, so that the custom did not arise from a pure
misunderstanding; though at a later period the symbolical character gave
place more and more to the casual misinterpretation. On the phylacteries
generally, see my Archologie and Herzog's Cycl.)

the Caraites, on the contrary, interpreted it figuratively, as a
proverbial expression for constant reflection upon, and fulfilment of,
the divine commands. The correctness of the latter is obvious from the
words themselves, which do not say that the commands are to be written
upon scrolls, but only that they are to be to the Israelites for signs
upon the hand, and for bands between the eyes, i.e., they are to be kept
in view like memorials upon the forehead and the hand. The expression in
[Deu 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008.md), "Thou shalt bind them for a
sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine
eyes," does not point at all to the symbolizing of the divine commands
by an outward sign to be worn upon the hand, or to bands with passages
of the law inscribed upon them, to be worn on the forehead between the
eyes; nor does the "advance in [Deu
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008.md) from heart to word, and from word
to hand or act," necessarily lead to the peculiar notion of Schultz,
that "the sleeve and turban were to be used as reminders of the divine
commands, the former by being fastened to the hand in a peculiar way,
the latter by an end being brought down upon the forehead." The line of
thought referred to merely expresses the idea, that the Israelites were
not only to retain the commands of God in their hearts, and to confess
them with the mouth, but to fulfil them with the hand, or in act and
deed, and thus to show themselves in their whole bearing as the
guardians and observers of the law. As the hand is the medium of action,
and carrying in the hand represents handling, so the space between the
eyes, or the forehead, is that part of the body which is generally
visible, and what is worn there is worn to be seen. This figurative
interpretation is confirmed and placed beyond doubt by such parallel
passages as [Pro 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md), "Bind them (the
commandments) about thy neck; write them upon the tables of thine heart"
(cf. [Pro 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021.md), [Pro
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022.md), [Exo
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md); [Exo
6:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#021.md); [Exo
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003).md).

[Exodus 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 13:17</span></span>

Journey from Succoth to Etham. - Succoth, Israel's first place of
encampment after their departure, was probably the rendezvous for the
whole nation, so that it was from this point that they first proceeded
in an orderly march. The shortest and most direct route from Egypt to
Canaan would have been by the road to Gaza, in the land of the
Philistines; but God did not lead them by this road, lest they should
repent of their movement as soon as the Philistines opposed them, and so
desire to return to Egypt, פּן: μή, after אמר to say (to himself), i.e.,
to think, with the subordinate idea of anxiety. The Philistines were
very warlike, and would hardly have failed to resist the entrance of the
Israelites into Canaan, of which they had taken possession of a very
large portion. But the Israelites were not prepared for such a conflict,
as is sufficiently evident from their despair, in [Exo
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010.md). For this reason God made them
turn round (יסּב for יסב, see Ges. 67) by the way of the desert of the
Red Sea. Previous to the account of their onward march, it is still
further stated in [Exo 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018.md), [Exo
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#019.md), that they went out equipped,
and took Joseph's bones with them, according to his last request.
חמשׁים, from חמשׁ lumbus, lit., lumbis accincti, signifies equipped, as
a comparison of this word as it is used in [Jos
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#014.md); [Jos
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#012.md), with חלוּצים in [Num
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#030.md), [Num
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#032.md); [Deu
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#018.md), places beyond all doubt; that is
to say, not "armed," καθωπλισμένοι (Sym.), but prepared for the march,
as contrasted with fleeing in disorder like fugitives. For this reason
they were able to fulfil Joseph's request, from which fact Calvin draws
the following conclusion: "In the midst of their adversity the people
had never lost sight of the promised redemption. For unless the
celebrated adjuration of Joseph had been a subject of common
conversation among them all, Moses would never have thought of it."

[Exodus 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 13:20</span></span>

From Succoth they went to Etham. With regard to the situation of Succoth
(from סכּת huts, probably a shepherd encampment), only so much can be
determined, that this place was to the south-east of Ramses, on the way
to Etham. Etham was "at the end of the desert," which is called the
desert of Etham in [Num 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#008.md), and the
desert of Shur (Jifar, see [Gen 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007).md)
in [Exo 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#022.md); so that it was where
Egypt ends and the desert of Arabia begins, in a line which curves from
the northern extremity of the Gulf of Arabia up to the Birket Temseh, or
Crocodile Lake, and then on to Lake Menzalet. According to the more
precise statements of travellers, this line is formed from the point of
the gulf northwards, by a broad sandy tract of land to the east of
Ajrud, which never rises more than about three feet above the water-mark
(Robinson, Pal. i. p. 80). It takes in the banks of the old canal, which
commence about an hour and a half to the north of Suez, and run
northwards for a distance which Seetzen accomplished in 4 hours upon
camels (Rob. Pal. i. p. 548; Seetzen, R. iii. p. 151, 152). Then follow
the so-called Bitter Lakes, a dry, sometimes swampy basin, or deep white
salt plain, the surface of which, according to the measurements of
French engineers, is 40 or 50 feet lower than the ordinary water-mark at
Suez. On the north this basin is divided from the Birket Temseh by a
still higher tract of land, the so-called Isthmus of Arbek. Hence "Etham
at the end of the desert" is to be sought for either on the Isthmus of
Arbek, in the neighbourhood of the later Serapeum, or at the southern
end of the Bitter Lakes. The distance is a conclusive argument against
the former, and in favour of the latter; for although Seetzen travelled
from Suez to Arbek in 8 hours, yet according to the accounts of the
French savan, de Bois Aym, who passed through this basin several times,
from the northern extremity of the Bitter Lakes to Suez is 60,000 mtres
(16 hours' journey), - a distance so great, that the children of Israel
could not possibly have gone from Etham to Hachiroth in a day's march.
Hence we must look for Etham at the southern extremity of the basin of
the Bitter Lake,

(Note: There is no force in the objection to this situation, that
according to different geognostic indications, the Gulf of Suez formerly
stretched much farther north, and covered the basin of the Bitter Lake;
for there is no evidence that it reached as far as this in the time of
Moses; and the statements of early writers as to the position of
Heroopolis in the inner corner of the Arabian Gulf, and not far to the
north of Klysma, furnish no clear evidence of this, as Knobel has
already observed.)

which Israel might reach in two days from Abu Keishib, and then on the
third day arrive at the plain of Suez, between Ajrud and the sea.
Succoth, therefore, must be sought on the western border of the Bitter
Lake.

[Exodus 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 13:21</span></span>

From Etham, at the edge of the desert which separates Egypt from Asia,
the Israelites were to enter the pathless desert, and leave the
inhabited country. Jehovah then undertook to direct the march, and give
them a safe-conduct, through a miraculous token of His presence. Whilst
it is stated in [Exo 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017.md), [Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018.md), that Elohim led them and
determined the direction of their road, to show that they did not take
the course, which they pursued, upon their own judgment, but by the
direction of God; in [Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md), [Exo
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#022.md), it is said that "Jehovah went
before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by
night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, to go by day and night,"
i.e., that they might march at all hours.

(Note: Knobel is quite wrong in affirming, that according to the primary
work, the cloud was first instituted after the erection of the
tabernacle. For in the passages cited in proof of this ([Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md).; [Num
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015.md)., [Exo
10:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#011.md), cf. [Exo
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007).md), the cloud is invariably
referred to, with the definite article, as something already known, so
that all these passages refer to [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021) of the present chapter..md)

To this sign of the divine presence and guidance there was a natural
analogon in the caravan fire, which consisted of small iron vessels or
grates, with wood fires burning in them, fastened at the end of long
poles, and carried as a guide in front of caravans, and, according to
Curtius (de gestis Alex. M. V. 2, 7), in trackless countries in the
front of armies also, and by which the direction of the road was
indicated in the day-time by the smoke, and at night by the light of the
fire. There was a still closer analogy in the custom of the ancient
Persians, as described by Curtius (iii. 3, 9), of carrying fire, "which
they called sacred and eternal," in silver altars, in front of the army.
But the pillar of cloud and fire must not be confounded with any such
caravan and army fire, or set down as nothing more than a mythical
conception, or a dressing up of this natural custom. The cloud was not
produced by an ordinary caravan fire, nor was it "a mere symbol of the
presence of God, which derived all its majesty from the belief of the
Israelites, that Jehovah was there in the midst of them," according to
Kster's attempt to idealize the rationalistic explanation; but it had a
miraculous origin and a supernatural character. We are not to regard the
phenomenon as consisting of two different pillars, that appeared
alternately, one of cloud, and the other of fire. There was but one
pillar of both cloud and fire ([Exo
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024).md); for even when shining in the
dark, it is still called the pillar of cloud ([Exo
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019).md), or the cloud ([Num
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#021).md); so that it was a cloud with a
dark side and a bright one, causing darkness and also lighting the night
([Exo 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020).md), or "a cloud, and fire in
it by night" ([Exo 40:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#038).md).
Consequently we have to imagine the cloud as the covering of the fire,
so that by day it appeared as a dark cloud in contrast with the light of
the sun, but by night as a fiery splendour, "a fire-look" (כּמראה־אשׁ,
[Num 9:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015).md). When this cloud went
before the army of Israel, it assumed the form of a column; so that by
day it resembled a dark column of smoke rising up towards heaven, and by
night a column of fire, to show the whole army what direction to take.
But when it stood still above the tabernacle, or came down upon it, it
most probably took the form of a round globe of cloud; and when it
separated the Israelites from the Egyptians at the Red Sea, we have to
imagine it spread out like a bank of cloud, forming, as it were, a
dividing wall. In this cloud Jehovah, or the Angel of God, the visible
representative of the invisible God under the Old Testament, was really
present with the people of Israel, so that He spoke to Moses and gave
him His commandments out of the cloud. In this, too, appeared "the glory
of the Lord" ([Exo 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#010.md); [Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md); [Num
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#007).md), the Shechinah of the later
Jewish theology. The fire in the pillar of cloud was the same as that in
which the Lord revealed Himself to Moses out of the bush, and afterwards
descended upon Sinai amidst thunder and lightning in a thick cloud ([Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md), [Exo
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018).md). It was a symbol of the "zeal
of the Lord," and therefore was enveloped in a cloud, which protected
Israel by day from heat, sunstroke, and pestilence ([Isa
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md); [Isa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010.md); [Psa
91:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005.md); [Psa
121:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006).md), and by night lighted up its
path by its luminous splendour, and defended it from the terrors of the
night and from all calamity ([Psa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)., [Psa
91:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005).md); but which also threatened
sudden destruction to those who murmured against God ([Num
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010).md), and sent out a devouring fire
against the rebels and consumed them ([Lev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002.md); [Num
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035).md). As Sartorius has aptly said,
"We must by no means regard it as a mere appearance or a poetical
figure, and just as little as a mere mechanical clothing of elementary
forms, such, for example, as storm-clouds or natural fire. Just as
little, too, must we suppose the visible and material part of it to have
been an element of the divine nature, which is purely spiritual. We must
rather regard it as a dynamic conformation, or a higher corporeal form,
composed of the earthly sphere and atmosphere, through the determining
influence of the personal and specific (specimen faciens) presence of
God upon the earthly element, which corporeal form God assumed and
pervaded, that He might manifest His own real presence therein."

(Note: "This is done," Sartorius proceeds to say, "not by His making His
own invisible nature visible, nor yet merely figuratively or ideally,
but by His rendering it objectively perceptible through the energy it
excites, and the glorious effects it produces. The curtain (velum) of
the natural which surrounds the Deity is moved and lifted (revelatur) by
the word of His will, and the corresponding intention of His presence
(per dextram Dei). But this is effected not by His causing the light of
His countenance, which is unapproachable, to burst forth unveiled, but
by His weaving out of the natural element a holy, transparent veil,
which, like the fiery cloud, both shines and throws a shade, veils and
unveils, so that it is equally true that God dwells in light and that He
dwells in darkness ([Ch2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001.md); [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016).md), as true that He can be found as
that He must always be sought.")

[Exo 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#022.md)

This sign of the presence of God did not depart from Israel so long as
the people continued in the wilderness.
