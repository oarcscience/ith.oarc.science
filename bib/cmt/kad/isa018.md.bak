### [Isaiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

Ethiopia's Submission to Jehovah - [Isa
18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md)

The notion that [Isa 18:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004.md) contains
an account of the judgment of Jehovah upon Ethiopia is quite an
untenable one. The prophet is here predicting the destruction of the
army of Sennacherib in his usual way, and in accordance with the actual
fulfilment ([Isa 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036).md). The view
which Hofmann has adopted from the Jewish expositors - namely, that the
people so strangely described at the commencement and close of the
prophecy is the Israelitish nation - is equally untenable. It is
Ethiopia. Taking both these facts together, then, the conclusion to
which we are brought is, that the prophet is here foretelling the effect
that will be produced upon Ethiopia by the judgment which Jehovah is
about to inflict upon Asshur. But it is altogether improbable either
that the prophecy falls later than the Assyrian expedition against Egypt
(as Schegg supposes), or that the Ethiopian ambassadors mentioned here
are despatched to Judah to seek for friendship and aid (as Ewald,
Knobel, Meier, and Thenius maintain). The expedition was still
impending, and that against Judah was the means to this further end. The
ambassadors are not sent to Judah, but carry commands with the most
stirring despatch to every province under Ethiopian rule. The Ethiopian
kingdom is thrown into the greatest excitement in the face of the
approaching Assyrian invasion, and the messengers are sent out to raise
the militia. At that time both Egypts were governed by the Ethiopian (or
twenty-fifth) dynasty, Sabako the Ethiopian having made himself master
of the country on the Lower Nile.

(Note: See Brugsch, Histoire d'Egypte, i. (1859) 244-246.)

The king of Egypt who was contemporaneous with Sennacherib was the
Tirhaka of the Old Testament, the Tarakos of Manetho, and the Tearkon of
Strabo - a great conqueror, according to Megasthenes, like Sesostris and
Nebuchadnezzar, who had carried his conquests as far as the Pillars of
Hercules (Strabo, xv 1, 6). This explains the strangely sounding
description given in [Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002.md), [Isa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007.md) of the Ethiopian people, which
had the universal reputation in antiquity of gigantic strength and
invincibility. It is impossible to determine the length of time that
intervened between the composition of the prophecy and the fourteenth
year of Hezekiah's reign, in which the Assyrian army commenced the
expedition across Judah to Egypt. The event which the prophecy foretells
- namely, that the judgment of Jehovah upon Asshur would be followed by
the submission of Ethiopia to Jehovah - was only partially and
provisionally fulfilled ([Ch2 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023).md).
And there is nothing to surprise us in this, inasmuch as in the
prophecies delivered before the destruction of Assyria the latter always
presented itself to the mind of the prophet as the kingdom of the world;
and consequently the prophecy had also an eschatological feature, which
still remained for a future and remote fulfilment.

[Isaiah 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 18:1</span></span>

The prophecy commences with hoi, which never signifies heus, but always
vae (woe). Here, however, it differs from [Isa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012.md), and is an expression of
compassion (cf., [Isa 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md); [Zac
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010).md) rather than of anger; for the
fact that the mighty Ethiopia is oppressed by the still mightier Asshur,
is a humiliation which Jehovah has prepared for the former. [Isa
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md), [Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002.md): "Woe to the land of the whirring
of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Cush, that sends ambassadors
into the sea and in boats of papyrus over the face of the waters." The
land of Cush commences, according to [Eze
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010.md) (cf., [Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006).md), where Upper Egypt ends. The
Sevēneh (Aswân), mentioned by Ezekiel, is the boundary-point at which
the Nile enters Mizraim proper, and which is still a depot for goods
coming from the south down the Nile. The naharē-Cush (rivers of Cush)
are chiefly those that surround the Cushite Seba ([Gen
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007).md). This is the name given to the
present Sennr, the Meroitic island which is enclosed between the White
and Blue Nile (the Astapos of Ptolemy, or the present Bahr el-Abyad, and
the Astaboras of Ptolemy, or the present Bahr el-Azrak). According to
the latest researches, more especially those of Speke, the White Nile,
which takes its rise in the Lake of Nyanza, is the chief source of the
Nile. The latter, and the Blue Nile, whose confluence (makran) with it
takes place in lat. 15 25, are fed by many larger or smaller tributary
streams (as well as mountain torrents); the Blue Nile even more than the
Nile proper. And this abundance of water in the land to the south of
Sevēnēh, and still farther south beyond Seba (or Mero), might very well
have been known to the prophet as a general fact. The land "beyond the
rivers of Cush" is the land bounded by the sources of the Nile, i.e.,
(including Ethiopia itself in the stricter sense of the word) the south
land under Ethiopian rule that lay still deeper in the heart of the
country, the land of its African auxiliary tribes, whose names (which
probably include the later Nubians and Abyssinians), as given in [Ch2
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003.md); [Nah
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#009.md); [Eze
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005.md); [Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md), suppose a minuteness of
information which has not yet been attained by modern research. To this
Ethiopia, which is designated by its farthest limits (compare [Zep
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010.md), where Wolff, in his book of
Judith, erroneously supposes Media to be intended as the Asiatic Cush),
the prophets give the strange name of eretz tziltzal cenâp. This has
been interpreted as meaning "the land of the wings of an army with
clashing arms" by Gesenius and others; but cenâphaim does not occur in
this sense, like 'agappim in Ezekiel. Others render it "the land of the
noise of waves" (Umbreit); but cenâphaim cannot be used of waters except
in such a connection as [Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md).
Moreover, tziltzal is not a fitting onomatopoetic word either for the
clashing of arms or the noise of waves. Others, again, render it "the
land of the double shadow" (Grotius, Vitringa, Knobel, and others); but,
however appropriate this epithet might be to Ethiopia as a tropical
land, it is very hazardous to take the word in a sense which is not
sustained by the usage of the language; and the same objection may be
brought against Luzzatto's "land of the far-shadowing defence." Shelling
has also suggested another objection - namely, that the shadow thrown
even in tropical lands is not a double one, falling northwards and
southwards at the same time, and therefore that it cannot be
figuratively described as double-winged. Tziltzal cenâphaim is the
buzzing of the wings of insects, with which Egypt and Ethiopia swarmed
on account of the climate and the abundance of water: צלצל, constr.
צלצל, tinnitus, stridor, a primary meaning from which the other three
meanings of the word-cymbal, harpoon (a whirring dart), and grasshopper

(Note: Schrring supposes tziltzal to be the scarabaeus sacer (Linn.);
but it would be much more natural, if any particular animal is intended,
to think of the tzaltzalya, as it is called in the language of the
Gallas, the tzetze in the Betschuana language, the most dreaded diptera
of the interior of Africa, a species of glossina which attacks all the
larger mammalia (though not men). Vid., Hartmann,
Naturgeschichtlich-medic. Skizze der Nillnder, Abth. i. p. 205.)

\- are derived. In [Isa 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md) the
forces of Egypt are called "the fly from the end of the rivers of
Egypt." Here Egypt and Ethiopia are called the land of the whirring of
wings, inasmuch as the prophet had in his mind, under the designation of
swarms of insects, the motley swarms of different people included in
this great kingdom that were so fabulously strange to an Asiatic. Within
this great kingdom messengers were now passing to and fro upon its great
waters in boats of papyrus (on gōme, Copt. ‛gōme, Talm. gâmi, see at
[Job 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011).md), Greek βαρίδες παπύριναι
(βαρίς, from the Egyptian bari, bali, a barque). In such vessels as
these, and with Egyptian tackle, they went as far as the remote island
of Taprobane. The boats were made to clap together (pilcatiles), so as
to be carried past the cataracts (Parthey on Plutarch. de Iside, pp.
198-9). And it is to these messengers in their paper boats that the
appeal of the prophet is addressed.

He sends them home; and what they are to say to their own people is
generalized into an announcement to the whole earth. "Go, swift
messengers, to the people stretched out and polished, to the terrible
people far away on the other side, to the nation of command upon command
and treading down, whose land rivers cut through. All ye possessors of
the globe and inhabitants of the earth, when a banner rises on the
mountains, look ye; and when they blow the trumpets, hearken!" We learn
from what follows to what it is that the attention of Ethiopia and all
the nations of the earth is directed: it is the destruction of Asshur by
Jehovah. They are to attend, when they observe the two signals, the
banner and the trumpet-blast; these are decisive moments. Because
Jehovah was about to deliver the world from the conquering might of
Assyria, against which the Ethiopian kingdom was now summoning all the
means of self-defence, the prophet sends the messengers home. Their own
people, to which he sends them home, are elaborately described. They are
memusshâk, stretched out, i.e., very tall (lxx ἔθνος μετέωρον), just as
the Sabaeans are said to have been in [Isa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014.md). They are also mōrât = memorât
(Ges. 52, Anm. 6), smoothed, politus, i.e., either not disfigured by an
ugly growth of hair, or else, without any reference to depilation, but
rather with reference to the bronze colour of their skin, smooth and
shining with healthy freshness. The description which Herodotus gives of
the Ethiopians, μέγιστοι καὶ κάλλιστοι ἀνθρώπων πάντων (iii. 20), quite
answers to these first two predicates. They are still further described,
with reference to the wide extent of their kingdom, which reached to the
remotest south, as "the terrible nation והלאה מן־הוּא," i.e., from this
point, where the prophet meets with the messengers, farther and farther
off (compare [Sa1 20:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#021.md), but not
[Sa1 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#009.md), where the expression has a
chronological meaning, which would be less suitable here, where
everything is so pictorial, and which is also to be rejected, because
מן־הוּא cannot be equivalent to הוּא מאשׁר; cf., [Nah
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#009).md). We may see from [Isa
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010.md), [Isa
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013.md), what kâv (kăv, with connecting
accusatives and before makkeph), a measuring or levelling line,
signifies, when used by the prophet with the reduplication which he
employs here: it is a people of "command upon command," - that is to
say, a commanding nation; (according to Ewald, Knobel, and others, kâv
is equivalent to the Arabic kūwe, strength, a nation of double or
gigantic strength.) "A people of treading down" (sc., of others; mebūsah
is a second genitive to goi), i.e., one which subdues and tramples down
wherever it appears. These are all distinctive predicates - a nation of
imposing grandeur, a ruling and conquering nation. The last predicate
extols its fertile land. בּזא we take not in the sense of diripere, or
as equivalent to bâzaz, like מאס, to melt, equivalent to mâsas, but in
the sense of findere, i.e., as equivalent to בזע, like גּמא, to sip =
גּמע. For it is no praise to say that a land is scoured out, or washed
away, by rivers. Bttcher, who is wrong in describing this chapter as
"perhaps the most difficult in the whole of the Old Testament," very
aptly compares with it the expression used by Herodotus (ii. 108),
κατετμήθη ἡ Αἴγυπτος. But why this strange elaboration instead of the
simple name? There is a divine irony in the fact that a nation so great
and glorious, and (though not without reason, considering its natural
gifts) so full of self-consciousness, should be thrown into such violent
agitation in the prospect of the danger that threatened it, and should
be making such strenuous exertions to avert that danger, when Jehovah
the God of Israel was about to destroy the threatening power itself in a
night, and consequently all the care and trouble of Ethiopia were
utterly needless.

[Isaiah 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 18:4</span></span>

The prophet knows for certain that the messengers may be home and
announce this act of Jehovah to their own people and to all the world.
"For thus hath Jehovah spoken to me: I will be still, and will observe
upon my throne during clear weather in sunshine, during a cloud of dew
in the heat of harvest. For before the harvest, when the blossom falls
off, and the fruit becomes the ripening grape: then will He cut off the
branches with pruning-hooks; and the tendrils He removes, breaks off.
They are left altogether to the birds of prey on the mountains, and to
the cattle of the land; and the birds of prey summer thereon, and all
the cattle of the land will winter thereon." The prophecy explains
itself here, as is very frequently the case, especially with Isaiah; for
the literal words of v. 6 show us unquestionably what it is that Jehovah
will allow to develop itself so prosperously under favourable
circumstances, and without any interposition on His part, until He
suddenly and violently puts an end to the whole, must as it is
approaching perfect maturity. It is the might of Assyria. Jehovah
quietly looks on from the heavenly seat of His glorious presence,
without disturbing the course of the thing intended. This quietness,
however, is not negligence, but, as the hortative expressions show, a
well-considered resolution. The two Caphs in v. 4 are not comparative,
but indicate the time. He remains quiet whilst there is clear weather
with sunshine (עלי indicating continuance, as in [Jer
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#018.md); [Sa1
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#032).md), and whilst there is a
dew-cloud in the midst of that warmth, which is so favourable for the
harvest, by causing the plants that have been thoroughly heated in the
day and refreshed at night by the dew, to shoot up and ripen with
rapidity and luxuriance. The plant thought of, as v. 5 clearly shows, is
the vine. By liphnē kâtzir (before the harvest) we are either to
understand the period just before the wheat-harvest, which coincides
with the flowering of the grape; or, since Isaiah uses kâtzir for bâzri
in [Isa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md), the time at the close of
the summer, immediately preceding the vintage. Here again the Caph
indicates the time. When the blossoming is over, so that the flower
fades away, and the fruit that has set becomes a ripening grape (boser,
as in [Job 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#033.md), not in the sense of
labruscum, but of omphax; and gâmal, maturescere, as in [Num
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008), maturare.md), He cuts off the
branches (zalzalilm, from zilzēl, to swing to and fro; compare the
Arabic dâliye, a vine-branch, from dalâ, to hang long and loose) upon
which the nearly ripened grapes are hanging, and removes or nips off

(Note: התז = התז with a pausal sharpening of the tzere, which is
lengthened by the tone, from tâzaz or tı̄z in post-biblical Hebrew, to
knock off, knock to pieces, or weaken (compare tâshash). On this change
of vowels in pause, see at [Gen 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#014.md);
and compare Olshausen, 91, d. For an example of the post-biblical use of
the word, vid., b. Sanhedrin 102a, "like two sticks hammattı̄zōth," i.e.,
one of which "hits the other in two" (hittiz, apparently from tūz, or
tiz, like hinnı̄ach from nuach).)

the tendrils (netishoth, as in [Jer
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md), from nâtash, to stretch far out;
niphal, to twist about a long way, [Isa
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008.md), compare [Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032).md); an intentional asyndeton with
a pictorial sound. The words of Jehovah concerning Himself have here
passed imperceptibly into words of the prophet concerning Jehovah. The
ripening grapes, as [Isa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#006.md) now
explains, are the Assyrians, who were not far from the summit of their
power; the fruit-branches that are cut off and nipped in pieces are
their corpses, which are now through both summer and winter the food of
swarms of summer birds, as well as of beasts of prey that remain the
whole winter through. This is the act of divine judgment, to which the
approaching exaltation of the banner, and the approaching blast of
trumpets, is to call the attention of the people of Ethiopia.

[Isaiah 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 18:7</span></span>

What effect this act of Jehovah would have upon the Ethiopian kingdom,
if it should now take place, is described in [Isa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007.md) : "At that time will there be
offered as a homage to Jehovah of hosts a nation stretched out and
polished, and from a terrible people, far away on the other side; a
nation of command upon command and treading down, whose land rivers cut
through, at the place of the name of Jehovah of hosts, the mountain of
Zion." עם (a people), at the commencement, cannot possibly be equivalent
to מעם (from a people). If it were taken in this sense, it would be
necessary to make the correction accordingly, as Knobel has done; but
the important parallels in [Isa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md)
and [Zep 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010.md) are against this.
Consequently ‛am and goi (people and nation) must be rendered as
subjects; and the מן in מעם must be taken as partitive. Ethiopia is
offered, i.e., offers itself, as a free-will offering to Jehovah,
impelled irresistibly by the force of the impression made by the mighty
act of Jehovah, or, as it is expressed in "the Titan among the Psalms"
([Psa 68:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#032.md), probably a Davidic psalm
of the time of Hezekiah), "there come kingdoms of splendour out of
Egypt; Cush rapidly stretches out its hands to Elohim." In order that
the greatness of this spiritual conquest might be fully appreciated, the
description of this strangely glorious people is repeated here; and with
this poetical rounding, the prophecy itself, which was placed as a kind
of overture before the following massa Mitzraim when the prophet
collected the whole of his prophecies together, is brought to a close.
