Divine Discourse concerning the True Sacrifice and Worship

With the preceding Psalm the series of the Korahitic Elohim-Psalms of
the primary collection ([Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md)
closes. There are, reckoning [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) and [Psa
43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md) as one Psalm, seven of them
([Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001).md). They form the principal
group of the Korahitic Psalms, to which the third book furnishes a
supplement, bearing in part an Elohimic ([Psa
84:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001).md) and in part a Jehovic impress
([Psa 85:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001); Ps 87:1-88:18.md). The
Asaphic Psalms, on the contrary, belong exclusively to the Elohimic
style of Psalms, but do not, however, all stand together: the principal
group of them is to be found in the third book ([Psa
73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001).md), and the primary collection
contains only one of them, viz., Ps 50, which is here placed immediately
after Ps 49 on account of several points of mutual relationship, and
more especially because the prominent Hear then, My people ([Psa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007).md), is in accord with the beginning
of Ps 49, Hear, all ye peoples.

According to [Ch1 23:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002.md), the whole of
the thirty-eight thousand Levites were divided by David into four
divisions (24,000 + 6000 + 4000 + 4000). To the fourth division (4000)
was assigned the music belonging to divine worship. Out of this
division, however, a select company of two hundred and eighty-eight
singers was further singled out, and divided into twenty-four classes.
These last were placed under three leaders or precentors (Sangmeister),
viz., fourteen classes under Heman the Kehathite and this fourteen sons;
four classes under Asaph the Gersonite and his four sons; and six
classes under Ethan (Jeduthun) and his six sons (1 Chr. 25, cf. [Psa
15:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001) :17ff..md). The instruments played
by these three leaders, which they made use of on account of their
clear, penetrating sound, were the cymbals ([Ch1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019).md). Also in [Ch1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005.md), where Asaph is described as the
chief (הראשׁ) of the sacred music in the tent where the Ark was placed,
he strikes the cymbals. That he was the chief, first leader, cannot be
affirmed. The usual order of the names if "Heman, Asaph, and Ethan." The
same order is also observed in the genealogies of the three in 1 Chron
6:16-32. Heman takes the prominent place, and at his right hand stands
Asaph, and on his left Ethan. History bears witness to the fact that
Asaph was also a Psalm-writer. For, according to [Ch2
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030.md), Hezekiah brought "the words of
David and of Asaph the seer" into use again in the service of the house
of God. And in the Book of Nehemiah, [Neh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#046.md), David and Asaph are placed side
by side as ראשׁי המּשׁררים in the days of old in Israel.

The twelve Psalms bearing the inscription לאסף are all Elohimic. The
name of God יהוה does not occur at all in two (Ps 77, [Psa
82:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001).md), and in the rest only once, or
at the most twice. Side by side with אלהים, אדני and אל are used as
favourite names, and especial preference is also given to עליון. Of
compounded names of God, אל אלהים והוה (only besides in [Jos
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#022).md) in the Psalter, and אלהים צבאות
in the Old Testament Scriptures generally (vid., Symbolae, pp. 14-16),
are exclusively peculiar to them. So far as concerns their contents,
they are distinguished from the Korahitic Psalms by their prophetically
judicial character. As in the prophets, God is frequently introduced as
speaking; and we meet with detailed prophetical pictures of the
appearing of God the Judge, together with somewhat long judicial
addresses (Ps 50; [Psa 75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md); [Psa
82:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001).md). The appellation החזה, which
Asaph bears in [Ch2 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030.md), accords
with this; notwithstanding the chronicler also applies the same epithet
to both the other precentors. The ground of this, as with נבּא, which is
used by the chronicler of the singing and playing of instruments in the
service of the house of God, is to be found in the intimate connection
between the sacred lyric and prophecy as a whole. The future visionary
character of the Asaphic Psalms has its reverse side in the historical
past. We frequently meet with descriptive retrospective glances at facts
of the primeval history ([Psa
74:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013.md); [Psa
77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015.md)., [Psa
80:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md); [Psa
81:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#005.md); [Psa
83:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010).md), and Ps 78 is entirely taken
up with holding up the mirror of the ancient history of the nation to
the people of the present. If we read the twelve Psalms of Asaph in
order one after the other, we shall, moreover, observe this striking
characteristic, that mention is made of Joseph and the tribes descended
from him more frequently than anywhere else ([Psa
77:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016.md); [Psa
78:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#009.md), [Psa
78:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067.md)., [Psa
81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006.md); [Psa
80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002)..md). Nor is another feature less
remarkable, viz., that the mutual relationship of Jahve to Israel is set
forth under the figure of the shepherd and his flock rather than any
other ([Psa 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md); 77:21; [Psa
78:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#052.md), [Psa
78:70-72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070.md); [Psa
79:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013.md); [Psa
80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002).md). Moreover these Psalms delight
in other respects to vary the designations for the people of God as much
as possible.

In Ps 50, [Psa 73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md), we have before us
a peculiar type of Psalms. The inscription לאסף has, so to speak,
deep-lying internal grounds in its support. But it does not follow from
this inscription that all these Psalms were composed by the aged Asaph,
who, as [Psa 78:69](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#069.md) shows, lived until
the early part of Solomon's reign. The outward marks peculiar to Asaph
were continued in his posterity even into the period after the Exile.
History mentions Asaphites under Jehoshaphat ([Ch2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014).md), under Hezekiah ([Ch2
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#013).md), and among the exiles who
returned ([Ezr 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#041.md), cf. [Ezr
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010.md), one hundred and twenty-eight
Asaphites; [Neh 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#044.md), cf. [Neh
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022.md), a hundred and forty-eight of
them). Since down to the period after the Exile even the cymbals
(מצלתּים) descended to them from their ancestor, the poetic talent and
enthusiasm may also have been hereditary among them. The later "Psalms
of Asaph," whether composed by later Asaphites or some other person, are
inscribed לאסף because, by whomsoever, they are composed in the style of
Asaph and after Asaphic models. Ps 50, however, is an original Psalm of
Asaph.

After the manner of the prophets the twofold truth is here advanced,
that God has no delight in animal sacrifice without the sacrifice of
prayer in which the heart is engaged, and that the confession of His
word without a life that accords with His word is an abomination to Him.
It is the very same fundamental thought which is expressed in [Psa
40:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md); [Psa
69:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#031.md)., [Psa
51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018.md)., and underlies [Psa
24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md) ([Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md) and [Psa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md); they are all echoes of the grand
utterance of Samuel ([Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022).md), the
father of the poetry of the Psalms. It cannot surprise one that stress
is laid on this denunciation of a heartless service of works by so many
voices during the Davidic age. The nothingness of the opus operatum is
also later on the watchword of the prophets in times when religious
observances, well ordered and in accordance with legal prescription,
predominate in Judah. Nor should it seem strange that Asaph the Levite,
who was appointed to the sanctuary on Zion, expresses himself thus; for
Jeremiah was also a Levite and even a priest (cohen), and yet no one has
spoken a bolder, and more cutting word against the outward and formal
service of sacrifice than he ([Jer
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022)..md). Both these objections being
removed, there is nothing else that stands in the way of our ascribing
this Psalm to Asaph himself. This is favoured by echoes of the Psalm in
the prophets (cf. [Psa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002.md) with [Lam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015.md), and the verse-ending [Psa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008.md), [Psa
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#018.md), with [Isa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016).md), and there is nothing opposed
to it in the form of the language.

[Psalms 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 50:1</span></span>

The theophany. The names of God are heaped up in [Psa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md) in order to gain a thoroughly
full-toned exordium for the description of God as the Judge of the
world. Hupfeld considers this heaping up cold and stiff; but it is
exactly in accordance with the taste of the Elohimic style. The three
names are co-ordinate with one another; for אל אלהים does not mean "God
of gods," which would rather be expressed by אלהי האלהים or אל אלים. אל
is the name for God as the Almighty; אלהים as the Revered One; יהוה as
the Being, absolute in His existence, and who accordingly freely
influences and moulds history after His own plan - this His peculiar
proper-name is the third in the triad. Perfects alternate in [Psa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md) with futures, at one time the
idea of that which is actually taking place, and at another of that
which is future, predominating. Jahve summons the earth to be a witness
of the divine judgment upon the people of the covenant. The addition
"from the rising of the sun to its going down," shows that the poet
means the earth in respect of its inhabitants. He speaks, and because
what He speaks is of universal significance He makes the earth in all
its compass His audience. This summons precedes His self-manifestation.
It is to be construed, with Aquila, the Syriac, Jerome, Tremellius, and
Montanus, "out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, Elohim shineth." Zion,
the perfect in beauty (cf. the dependent passage [Lam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015.md), and 1 Macc. 2:12, where the
temple is called ἡ καλλονὴ ἡμῶν), because the place of the presence of
God the glorious One, is the bright spot whence the brightness of the
divine manifestation spreads forth like the rising sun. In itself
certainly it is not inappropriate, with the lxx, Vulgate, and Luther, to
take מכלל־יפי as a designation of the manifestation of Elohim in His
glory, which is the non pius ultra of beauty, and consequently to be
explained according to [Eze 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#012.md), cf.
[Exo 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019.md), and not according to [Lam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015.md) (more particularly since Jeremiah
so readily gives a new turn to the language of older writers). But,
taking the fact into consideration that nowhere in Scripture is beauty
(יפי) thus directly predicated of God, to whom peculiarly belongs a
glory that transcends all beauty, we must follow the guidance of the
accentuation, which marks מכלל־יפי by Mercha as in apposition with ציּון
(cf. Psychol. S. 49; tr. p. 60). The poet beholds the appearing of God,
an appearing that resembles the rising of the sun (הופיע, as in the
Asaph [Psa 80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002.md), after [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md), from יפע, with a transition of
the primary notion of rising, Arab. yf‛, wf‛, to that of beaming forth
and lighting up far and wide, as in Arab. sṭ‛); for "our God will come
and by no means keep silence." It is not to be rendered: Let our God
come (Hupfeld) and not keep silence (Olshausen). The former wish comes
too late after the preceding הופיע (יבא is consequently veniet, and
written as e.g., in [Psa 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013).md), and
the latter is superfluous. אל, as in [Psa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006.md); [Psa
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003.md), [Isa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md), and frequently, implies in the
negative a lively interest on the part of the writer: He cannot, He dare
not keep silence, His glory will not allow it. He who gave the Law, will
enter into judgment with those who have it and do not keep it; He cannot
long look on and keep silence. He must punish, and first of all by word
in order to warn them against the punishment by deeds. Fire and storm
are the harbingers of the Lawgiver of Sinai who now appears as Judge.
The fire threatens to consume the sinners, and the storm (viz., a
tempest accompanied with lightning and thunder, as in [Job
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001).md) threatens to drive them away
like chaff. The expression in [Psa
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003.md) is like [Psa
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md). The fem. Niph. נשׂערה does not
refer to אשׁ, but is used as neuter: it is stormed, i.e., a storm rages
(Apollinaris, ἐλαιλαπίσθη σφόδρα). The fire is His wrath; and the storm
the power or force of His wrath.

[Psalms 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 50:4</span></span>

The judgment scene. To the heavens above (מעל, elsewhere a preposition,
here, as in [Gen 27:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#039.md); [Gen
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025), an adverb, desuper, superne.md)
and to the earth God calls (קרא אל, as, e.g., [Gen
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001).md), to both לדין עמּו, in order to
sit in judgment upon His people in their presence, and with them as
witnesses of His doings. Or is it not that they are summoned to attend,
but that the commission, [Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005.md), is
addressed to them (Olshausen, Hitzig)? Certainly not, for the act of
gathering is not one that properly belongs to the heavens and the earth,
which, however, because they exist from the beginning and will last for
ever, are suited to be witnesses ([Deu
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026.md); [Deu
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001.md); [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002), 1 Macc. 2:37.md). The summons אספוּ
is addressed, as in [Mat 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md), and
frequently in visions, to the celestial spirits, the servants of the God
here appearing. The accused who are to be brought before the divine
tribunal are mentioned by names which, without their state of mind and
heart corresponding to them, express the relationship to Himself in
which God has placed them (cf. [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md); [Isa
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019).md). They are called חסידים, as in
the Asaph [Psa 79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002.md). This
contradiction between their relationship and their conduct makes an
undesigned but bitter irony. In a covenant relationship, consecrated and
ratified by a covenant sacrifice (עלי־זבח similar to [Psa
92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md); [Psa
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010).md), has God placed Himself towards
them (Ex 24); and this covenant relationship is also maintained on their
part by offering sacrifices as an expression of their obedience and of
their fidelity. The participle כּרתי here implies the constant
continuance of that primary covenant-making. Now, while the accused are
gathered up, the poet hears the heavens solemnly acknowledge the
righteousness of the Judge beforehand. The participial construction שׁפט
הוּא, which always, according to the connection, expresses the present
([Nah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002).md), or the past ([Jdg
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004).md), or the future ([Jer
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031).md), is in this instance an
expression of that which is near at hand (fut. instans). הוּא has not
the sense of ipse (Ew. 314, a), for it corresponds to the "I" in אני
שׁפט or הנני שׁפט; and כּי is not to be translated by nam (Hitzig), for
the fact that God intends to judge requires no further announcement. On
the contrary, because God is just now in the act of sitting in judgment,
the heavens, the witnesses most prominent and nearest to Him, bear
witness to His righteousness. The earthly music, as the סלה directs, is
here to join in with the celestial praise. Nothing further is now
wanting to the completeness of the judgment scene; the action now
begins.

[Psalms 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 50:7</span></span>

Exposition of the sacrificial Tra for the good of those whose holiness
consists in outward works. The forms strengthened by ah, in [Psa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007.md), describe God's earnest desire to
have Israel for willing hearers as being quite as strong as His desire
to speak and to bear witness. העיד בּ, obtestari aliquem, to come
forward as witness, either solemnly assuring, or, as here and in the
Psalm of Asaph, [Psa 81:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#009.md), earnestly
warning and punishing (cf. Arab. šahida with b, to bear witness against
any one). On the Dagesh forte conjunctive in בּך, vid., Ges. ֗20, 2, a.
He who is speaking has a right thus to stand face to face with Israel,
for he is Elohim, the God of Israel - by which designation reference is
made to the words אנכי יהוה אלהיך ([Exo
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002).md), with which begins the Law as
given from Sinai, and which here take the Elohimic form (whereas in [Psa
81:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011) they remain unaltered.md) and are
inverted in accordance with the context. As [Psa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008.md) states, it is not the material
sacrifices, which Israel continually, without cessation, offers, that
are the object of the censuring testimony. ועולתיך, even if it has
Mugrash, as in Baer, is not on this account, according to the
interpretation given by the accentuation, equivalent to ועל־עולותיך (cf.
on the other hand [Psa 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#018).md); it is a
simple assertory substantival clause: thy burnt-offerings are, without
intermission, continually before Me. God will not dispute about
sacrifices in their outward characteristics; for - so [Psa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009.md) go on to say-He does not need
sacrifices for the sake of receiving from Israel what He does not
otherwise possess. His is every wild beast (חיתו, as in the Asaph [Psa
79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002).md) of the forest, His the cattle
בּהררי אלף, upon the mountains of a thousand, i.e., upon the thousand
(and myriad) mountains (similar to מתי מספּר or מתי מעט), or: where they
live by thousands (a similar combination to נבל עשׂור). Both
explanations of the genitive are unsupported by any perfectly analogous
instance so far as language is concerned; the former, however, is to be
preferred on account of the singular, which is better suited to it. He
knows every bird that makes its home on the mountains; ידע, as usually,
of a knowledge which masters a subject, compasses it and makes it its
own. Whatever moves about the fields if with Him, i.e., is within the
range of His knowledge (cf. [Job
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011.md); [Psa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#013).md), and therefore of His power;
זיז (here and in the Asaph [Psa 80:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#014).md)
from זאזא = זעזע, to move to and fro, like טיט from טיטע, to swept out,
cf. κινώπετον, κνώδαλον, from κινεῖν. But just as little as God requires
sacrifices in order thereby to enrich Himself, is there any need on His
part that might be satisfied by sacrifices, [Psa
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012.md). If God should hunger, He would
not stand in need of man's help in order to satisfy Himself; but He is
never hungry, for He is the Being raised above all carnal wants. Just on
this account, what God requires is not by any means the outward worship
of sacrifice, but a spiritual offering, the worship of the heart, [Psa
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014.md). Instead of the שׁלמים, and more
particularly זבח תּודה, [Lev 7:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011.md),
and שׁלמי נדר, [Lev 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016.md) (under the
generic idea of which are also included, strictly speaking, vowed
thank-offerings), God desires the thanksgiving of the heart and the
performance of that which has been vowed in respect of our moral
relationship to Himself and to men; and instead of the עולה in its
manifold forms of devotion, the prayer of the heart, which shall not
remain unanswered, so that in the round of this λογικὴ λατρεία
everything proceeds from and ends in εὐχαριστία. It is not the
sacrifices offered in a becoming spirit that are contrasted with those
offered without the heart (as, e.g., Sir. 32 \[35\]:1-9), but the
outward sacrifice appears on the whole to be rejected in comparison with
the spiritual sacrifice. This entire turning away from the outward form
of the legal ceremonial is, in the Old Testament, already a predictive
turning towards that worship of God in spirit and in truth which the new
covenant makes alone of avail, after the forms of the Law have served as
swaddling clothes to the New Testament life which was coming into being
in the old covenant. This "becoming" begins even in the Tra itself,
especially in Deuteronomy. Our Psalm, like the Chokma ([Pro
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003).md), and prophecy in the succeeding
age (cf. [Hos 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md); [Mic
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md); [Isa
1:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011), and other passages.md), stands
upon the standpoint of this concluding book of the Tra, which traces
back all the requirements of the Law to the fundamental command of love.

[Psalms 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016.md)

The accusation of the manifest sinners. It is not those who are
addressed in [Psa 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007.md), as
Hengstenberg thinks, who are here addressed. Even the position of the
words ולרשׁע אמר clearly shows that the divine discourse is now turned
to another class, viz., to the evil-doers, who, in connection with open
and manifest sins and vices, take the word of God upon their lips, a
distinct class from those who base their sanctity upon outward works of
piety, who outwardly fulfil the commands of God, but satisfy and deceive
themselves with this outward observance. מה־לּך ל, what hast thou, that
thou = it belongs not to thee, it does not behove thee. With ועתּה, in
[Psa 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017.md), an adversative subordinate
clause beings: since thou dost not care to know anything of the moral
ennobling which it is the design of the Law to give, and my words,
instead of having them as a constant test-line before thine eyes, thou
castest behind thee and so turnest thy back upon them (cf. [Isa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017).md). ותּרץ is not from רוּץ (lxx,
Targum, and Saadia), in which case it would have to be pointed ותּרץ,
but from רצה, and is construed here, as in [Job
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#009.md), with עם: to have pleasure in
intercourse with any one. In [Psa
50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018.md) the transgression of the eighth
commandment is condemned, in [Psa
50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018.md) that of the seventh, in [Psa
50:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#019.md). that of the ninth (concerning
the truthfulness of testimony). שׁלח פּה ברעה, to give up one's mouth
unrestrainedly to evil, i.e., so that evil issues from it. תּשׁב, [Psa
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020.md), has reference to gossiping
company (cf. [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md). דּפי signifies
a thrust, a push (cf. הדף), after which the lxx renders it ἐτίθεις
σκάνδαλον (cf. [Lev 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#014).md), but it
also signifies vexation and mockery (cf. גּדף); it is therefore to be
rendered: to bring reproach (Jerome, opprobrium) upon any one, to cover
him with dishonour. The preposition בּ with דּבּר has, just as in [Num
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md), and frequently, a hostile
signification. "Thy mother's son" is he who is born of the same mother
with thyself, and not merely of the same father, consequently thy
brother after the flesh in the fullest sense. What Jahve says in this
passage is exactly the same as that which the apostle of Jesus Christ
says in [Rom 2:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md). This
contradiction between the knowledge and the life of men God must, for
His holiness' sake, unmask and punish, [Psa
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020.md). The sinner thinks otherwise:
God is like himself, i.e., that is also not accounted by God as sin,
which he allows himself to do under the cloak of his dead knowledge. For
just as a man is in himself, such is his conception also of his God
(vid., [Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026)..md). But God will not
encourage this foolish idea: "I will therefore reprove thee and set (it)
in order before thine eyes" (ואערכה, not ואערכה, in order to give
expression, the second time at least, to the mood, the form of which has
been obliterated by the suffix); He will set before the eyes of the
sinner, who practically and also in theory denies the divine holiness,
the real state of his heart and life, so that he shall be terrified at
it. Instead of היה, the infin. intensit. here, under the influence of
the close connection of the clauses (Ew. 240, c), is היות; the oratio
obliqua begins with it, without כּי (quod). כמוך exactly corresponds to
the German deines Gleichen, thine equal.

Epilogue of the divine discourse. Under the name שׁכחי אלוהּ are
comprehended the decent or honourable whose sanctity relies upon outward
works, and those who know better but give way to licentiousness; and
they are warned of the final execution of the sentence which they have
deserved. In dead works God delighteth not, but whoso offereth
thanksgiving (viz., not shelamim-tôda, but the tôda of the heart), he
praises Him

(Note: In Vedic jag', old Bactrian jaz (whence jag'jas, the primitive
word of ἅγιος), the notions of offering and of praising lie one within
the other.)

and שׂם דּרך. It is unnecessary with Luther, following the lxx, Vulgate,
and Syriac versions, to read שׁם. The Talmudic remark אל תקרי ושׂם אלא
ושׁם \[do not read ושׂם, but ושׁם\] assumes ושׂם to be the traditional
reading. If we take שׂם דּרך as a thought complete in itself, - which is
perfectly possible in a certain sense (vid., [Isa
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019).md), - then it is best explained
according to the Vulgate (qui ordinat viam), with Bצttcher, Maurer, and
Hupfeld: viam h. e. recta incedere (legel agere) parans; but the
expression is inadequate to express this ethical sense (cf. [Pro
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026).md), and consequently is also
without example. The lxx indicates the correct idea in the rendering καὶ
ἐκεῖ ὁδὸς ᾗ δείξω αὐτῷ τὸ σωτήριον Θεοῦ. The ושׂם דוך (designedly not
pointed דּרך), which standing entirely by itself has no definite
meaning, receives its requisite supplement by means of the attributive
clause that follows. Such an one prepares a way along which I will grant
to him to see the salvation of Elohim, i.e., along which I will grant
him a rapturous vision of the full reality of My salvation. The form
יכבּדנני is without example elsewhere. It sounds like the likewise
epenthetical יקראנני, [Pro 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028.md), cf.
[Pro 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017.md), [Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015.md), and may be understood as an
imitation of it as regards sound. יכבּדנני (= יכבּדני) is in the
writer's mind as the form out of pause (Ges. ֗58, 4). With [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md) the Psalm recurs to its central
point and climax, [Psa 50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014.md). What
Jahve here discourses in a post-Sinaitic appearing, is the very same
discourse concerning the worthlessness of dead works and concerning the
true will of God that Jesus addresses to the assembled people when He
enters upon His ministry. The cycle of the revelation of the Gospel is
linked to the cycle of the revelation of the Law by the Sermon on the
Mount; this is the point at which both cycles touch.
