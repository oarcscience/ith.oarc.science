The Book of Joshua

Introduction

Contents, Date, and Character of the Book

The book of Joshua derives its name, יהושע, Ἰησοῦς Ναυή or υἱὸς Ναυή
(lxx), not from its author, but from its contents, viz., the history of
the guidance of Israel into the land of Canaan, the land promised to the
fathers, by Joshua the son of Nun. It commences immediately after the
death of Moses, with the command addressed by the Lord to Joshua, to
lead the children of Israel over the Jordan into Canaan, and not only to
take possession of this land, but to divide it among the tribes of
Israel ([Jos 1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001).md), and closes with
the death and burial of Joshua and his contemporary, the high priest
Eleazar ([Jos 24:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029).md). The contents
may be divided into two parts of nearly equal length-the conquest of
Canaan (Josh 1-12), and the division of it among the tribes of Israel
(Josh 12-24); [Jos 1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md) forming the
introductory notice, that when Moses was dead the Lord commanded Joshua,
who had been called to be the leader of Israel in his stead, to carry
out the work entrusted to him, and encouraged him by the promise of His
omnipotent help in the completion of it ([Jos
1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001).md), the history opens in the first
part, (1) with the preparations made by Joshua for advancing into
Canaan; viz., (a) the command of Joshua to the people to prepare for
crossing the Jordan, the summons to the two tribes and a half to help
their brethren to conquer Canaan ([Jos
1:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010).md), and the despatch of spies to
Jericho (Josh 2); (b) the crossing of the river, which had been laid dry
by a divine miracle (Josh 3 and 4); and (c) the preparation of Israel
for the conquest of the land, by the performance of circumcision and the
passover at Gilgal ([Jos 5:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001).md). Then
follow (2) the conquest and subjugation of Canaan; viz., (a) the
commencement of it by the miraculous fall of Jericho (Josh 5:13-6:27),
the attack upon Ai, and capture of that town, after the expiation of the
guilt that had been brought upon the congregation through the sin of
Achan against the ban (Josh 7-8:29), and the solemn act of setting up
the law in the land on Ebal and Gerizim ([Jos
8:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030)); (b.md) the further conquest of
the land through the subjugation of the Gibeonites, who had succeeded
surreptitiously in obtaining a treaty from Israel which guaranteed their
safety (Josh 9); the two great victories over the allied kings of Canaan
in the south (Josh 10) and north (Josh 11), with the capture of the
fortified towns of the land; and lastly, at the close of the first part,
the list of the conquered kings (Josh 12). - The second part commences
with the command of God to Joshua to divide the whole land among the
nine tribes and a half for a possession, although several parts of it
still remained unconquered; as two tribes and a half had already
received from Moses their inheritance on the eastern side of the Jordan,
the boundaries and towns of which are then described (Josh 13).
Accordingly Joshua, with the heads of the people appointed for the
purpose, proceeded to the distribution of the land, first of all (a) in
the camp at Gilgal, where Caleb was the first to receive his inheritance
([Jos 14:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001).md), and then, according to
the lot, the tribes of Judah (Josh 15) and Joseph, i.e., Ephraim and
(half) Manasseh ([Jos 16:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001) and 17.md);
and afterwards (b) at Shiloh, where the tabernacle was first of all
erected, and a description of the land to be divided written down ([Jos
18:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001).md), and then the rest of the
tribes-Benjamin (Josh 18:11-28), Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar, Asher,
Naphtali, and Dan (Josh 19), - received their inheritance, after which
the cities of refuge were selected ([Jos
20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001).md), and forty-eight cities were
given up by the twelve tribes for the Levites to occupy (Josh 21); and
finally, (c) the warriors belonging to the tribes beyond Jordan were
sent back by Joshua to their own inheritance (Josh 22). To this there is
appended, in the next place, an account of what Joshua did towards the
end of his life to establish the tribes of Israel securely in their
inheritance: viz., (a) an exhortation to the heads of the tribes, who
were gathered round him, to carry out their calling with fidelity (Josh
23); and (b) the renewal of the covenant at the diet at Shechem (Josh
24:1-28). This is followed by an account of the close of Joshua's life,
and the conclusion of the whole book ([Jos
24:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029).md). Thus the two parts or
halves of the book correspond exactly to one another, both in form and
in contents. As the events described in Josh 1:10-5:12 were preparatory
to the conquest of Canaan, so the diets held by Joshua after the
distribution of the land by lot (Josh 23-24:28) had no other object than
to establish the covenant people firmly in the inheritance bestowed upon
them by God, by exhorting them to be faithful to the Lord. And just as
Josh 12 rounds off the first part, as a kind of appendix which completes
the history of the conquest of the land, so Josh 22 is obviously an
appendix to the distribution of the land among the tribes, which brings
to a close the dismission of the people to the separate portions of
their inheritance.

The book of Joshua is not intended merely as a continuation of the
history of Israel from the death of Moses to the death of Joshua, still
less as a description of the acts of Joshua only. The purpose of the
book is rather to show how, after the death of Moses, the faithful
covenant God fulfilled to the children of Israel, whom He had adopted as
His people of possession through the mediation of His servant, the
promise which He had made to the patriarchs; how the Canaanites were
destroyed, and their land given to the tribes of Israel for an
hereditary possession through the medium of Joshua, the servant of
Moses, whom he had consecrated as leader of the people through the
laying on of hands and by putting some of his honour upon him. As the
servant of Moses treading in his footsteps, Joshua finished the work
which Moses was not allowed to bring to a conclusion on account of his
sin at the water of strife, viz., the planting and establishment of
Israel in Canaan, the land of its inheritance, which the Lord had
selected for His dwelling ([Exo 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017).md)
and chosen as the nursery ground of His kingdom. As Joshua simply
carried on in this respect, and brought to completion, the work which
Moses had begun, arranged, and set on foot, the book of Joshua is
naturally connected very closely with the books of Moses, though without
forming an integral part, or the last portion of it, and without being
written by Joshua himself.

The origin of the book of Joshua is involved in obscurity, as we can
neither find out its author, nor determine with certainty the date of
its composition. Whereas, on the one hand, the historical account bears
throughout the mark of having been written by an eye-witness, and even
by one who had taken part in the events described, and the description
given of the possessions allotted to the different tribes according to
their respective boundaries and the cities which they contained is
unquestionably founded upon contemporaneous writings, and in one passage
the writer actually classes himself with those who crossed over Jordan
into Canaan under the guidance of Joshua ([Jos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001), "until we were passed over".md); on
the other hand we find a number of historical statements in the book,
which point beyond the life of Joshua and are opposed to the idea that
it was written by Joshua himself. We do not include in these either the
closing accounts of the death of Joshua and Eleazar ([Jos
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029.md), [Jos
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#033).md), or the allusion to the "book
of the righteous" ([Jos 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013).md): for
these accounts might have been appended to a writing of Joshua's by a
later hand, just as in the case of the Pentateuch; and the book of the
righteous is not a work that was composed after the time of Joshua, but
a collection of odes in praise of the acts of the Lord in Israel, which
were composed by pious minstrels during the conquest of the land, and
were added one by one to this collection. Even the frequent repetition
of the statement that this or the other has continued "to this day,"
furnishes no certain proof that the book was not written in the closing
years of Joshua's life, when we consider the purely relative
signification of the formula, which is sometimes used in connection with
things that only lasted a few years. Apart from such passages as [Jos
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#003.md), [Jos
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#017.md), and [Jos
23:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#008.md), in which no one has discovered
any allusion to a later time than that of Joshua, we find the formula
"to this day" in [Jos 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#009.md); [Jos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009.md); [Jos
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#025.md); [Jos
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#026.md); [Jos
8:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028.md); [Jos
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027.md); [Jos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013.md); [Jos
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#014.md); [Jos
15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063.md), and [Jos
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010.md). But if the remark made in [Jos
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#025.md) with regard to Rahab, "she
dwelleth in Israel unto this day," was certainly written during her
lifetime, such statements as that the first encampment of Israel in
Canaan "is called Gilgal unto this day," on account of the circumcision
of the people that took place there, and that the valley in which Achan
was stoned is called Achor "unto this day" ([Jos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009.md); [Jos
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#026).md), or that the memorial stones set
up in the bed of the Jordan ([Jos
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#009).md), and the heaps of stones raised
upon the bodies of Achan and the king of Ai ([Jos
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#026.md); [Jos
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029).md), remain "unto this day;" that
"unto this day" Ai remains an heap ([Jos
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028).md), the Gibeonites are hewers of
wood and drawers of water to the congregation ([Jos
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027).md), and Hebron is the inheritance
of Caleb ([Jos 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#014).md); that the
Geshurites and Maachathites have not been expelled ([Jos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013).md), nor the inhabitants of
Jerusalem and Gezer ([Jos 15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063.md); [Jos
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010).md), but dwell among and by the
side of Israel "unto this day," may be just as easily understood, if
they were made ten of fifteen years after the conquest and division of
Canaan, as if they were made after an interval of eighty or a hundred
years. For even in giving names, the remark that the new name has
remained to this day is of greater significance at the end of ten years
than after an interval of a century, since its permanence would be fully
secured if it made its way to general adoption during the first ten
years. The formula "to this day" proves nothing more than that the
written record was not quite contemporaneous with the events; but it
does not warrant us in concluding that the book itself was written
several generations, or even centuries, after the settlement of Israel
in Canaan.

It is different with the accounts of the conquest of Hebron by Caleb,
Debir by Othniel, and Leshem by the Danites ([Jos
15:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md) and [Jos
19:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047).md). Considered by themselves,
these conquests could no doubt have taken place before the death of
Joshua, as he lived for some time after the distribution of the land and
the settlement of the different tribes in the possessions allotted to
them (compare [Jos 19:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#050.md) and [Jos
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001.md), with [Jos
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#004.md) and [Jos
21:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043).md). But if we compare these
accounts with the parallel accounts of the same conquests in [Jdg
1:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#010.md) and [Jdg
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018.md), there can be no doubt that it
was after Joshua's death that the places mentioned were taken
permanently from the Canaanites, came into the actual and permanent
possession of the Israelites. For, according to [Jdg
1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md), the Israelites inquired of the
Lord, after the death of Joshua, who should begin the war with the
Canaanites, i.e., with those who had not yet been destroyed, and
received this reply, "Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the
land into his hand;" whereupon Judah and Simeon smote the Canaanites at
Bezek, then advanced against Jerusalem, took this city and set it on
fire, and "afterward" ([Jdg 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#009).md)
proceeded against the Canaanites on the mountains and in the south, and
took Hebron and Debir. From this account it is evident at once that even
the capture of Jerusalem did not take place till after the death of
Joshua, and that even then the Jebusites were not driven out of
Jerusalem, but continued to dwell there by the side of the Benjamites
([Jdg 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#021).md), so that the same
statement in [Jos 15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063.md) also points
beyond the death of Joshua. It is equally evident from Judg 18 that the
Danites of Zorah and Eshtaol did not enter upon the expedition against
Leshem or Laish till after Joshua's death. This also applies to the
other statements concerning the failure to expel the Canaanite out of
different districts and towns, which are common to this book and the
book of Judges (compare [Jos 13:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002.md);
[Jos 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010.md), and [Jos
17:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md), with [Jdg
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003.md); [Jdg
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#029.md), and [Jdg
1:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027).md), so that we might infer from
every one of these passages that this book of Joshua was not written
till after Joshua's death, and therefore that the closing accounts of
his death in [Jos 24:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029.md) formed a
part of the original work.

If we endeavour to determine the date of composition more exactly, we
have first of all to bear in mind the fact, that the wars and conquests
just referred to cannot have occurred a very long time after Joshua's
death; for, in the first place, it was in the very nature of things,
that when the different tribes of Israel proceeded into their different
possessions, even if they did not commence the attack upon the remaining
Canaanites immediately, they would certainly do so very soon, in order
that they might obtain complete and undisputed possession of the land.
Moreover, when the division of the land by lot took place, Caleb was
eighty-five years old; and yet he lived to see the capture of Hebron and
Debir, and even took part in it, inasmuch as he not only promised but
was able to give his daughter to the conqueror of Debir for a wife ([Jos
15:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md); [Jdg
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#011)..md). It was no doubt shortly after
these wars, in which Judah took possession of the mountains, but was
unable to destroy the Canaanites who dwelt in the valley, because of
their possessing iron chariots ([Jdg
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#019).md), that the Danites felt obliged
to go northwards to conquer Leshem, and take it for a possession, on
account of the inheritance assigned them by lot between Judah and
Ephraim being too small for them, because the Canaanites had not been
expelled. And whilst all these occurrences, which are mentioned in the
book of Joshua, fell within the period immediately succeeding the death
of Joshua, we can find distinct evidence in the book itself that it was
not written after, but before, the establishment of the monarchy in
Israel. According to [Jos 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010.md), the
Canaanites were still dwelling in Gezer; yet they were destroyed at the
close of David's reign, or the commencement of that of Solomon, when
Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, conquered the town ([Kg1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#016).md). According to [Jos
15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063.md), the Jebusites had not yet been
driven out of Jerusalem; but this was accomplished by David at the
beginning of his reign over all the tribes of Israel ([Sa2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003.md), [Sa2
5:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006).md). According to [Jos
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027.md), the place for the temple had not
yet been chosen, but this was done in the time of David ([Sa2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#008.md).; [Ch1
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016)..md). And the Gibeonites were still
hewers of wood and drawers of water to the congregation for the altar of
the Lord, by virtue of the treaty which Joshua and the elders had made
with them; whereas this treaty was violated by Saul, who endeavoured to
destroy the Gibeonites ([Sa2 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001)..md).
If we add to this, that our book shows no traces whatever of later times
and circumstances either in its style or contents, but that it is
closely connected with the Pentateuch in the language as well as in its
peculiar stand-point-for example, when the only Phoenicians mentioned
are the Sidonians, and they are reckoned as belonging to the Canaanites
who were to be destroyed ([Jos
13:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004).md), whereas in the time of David
we find the circumstances entirely changed ([Sa2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011.md); [Kg1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015.md); [Ch1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001).md); and again when Sidon is
referred to as the chief city of Phoenicia, and the epithet "great" is
applied to it ([Jos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008.md); [Jos
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028).md), whereas Tyre had outstripped
Sidon even in the days of David, - the conclusion becomes an extremely
probable one, that the book was written not later than twenty or
twenty-five years after the death of Joshua, in all probability by one
of the elders who crossed the Jordan with Joshua, and had taken part in
the conquest of Canaan (vid., [Jos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md), [Jos
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#006).md), but who survived Joshua a
considerable time ([Jos 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#031.md); [Jdg
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#007).md).

But even if the book of Joshua was not composed till some time after the
events recorded (and the authorship cannot be determined with
certainty), this does not affect its historico-prophetic character; for
both the contents and form of the book show it to be an independent and
simple work composed with historical fidelity, and a work which is as
thoroughly pervaded with the spirit of the Old Testament revelation as
the Pentateuch itself. However closely it is connected with the
Pentateuch both in language and contents, there is no tenable ground for
the hypothesis set up in various forms by modern critics, that it has
arisen, just like the Pentateuch, from the fusion of two or three
earlier writings, and was composed by the so-called "Deuteronomist."
For, even if we leave altogether out of sight the fact that this
hypothesis is unfounded and untenable in the case of the Pentateuch, the
supposed community of authorship between the book of Joshua and that of
Deuteronomy, as well as the rest of the Pentateuch, in the revised from
in which it has come down to us, is founded chiefly upon the opinion
that the death of Moses, with which the Pentateuch closes, "does not
form a fitting conclusion for a work which commenced with the creation,
and treated the earlier history in the manner in which this is done in
the Pentateuch;" because "it is hardly conceivable that a historical
work, which was written at any rate some time after the conquest of the
land of Canaan by the Israelites, should describe all the preparations
that were made for the conquest of the land, and then break off without
including either the capture of the land, or the division of it among
the remaining tribes" (Bleek's Einleitung, Sthelin, and others). But, in
the first place, it is to be observed that the Pentateuch was not
written "some time after the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites," and
is not to be regarded as a historical work in the sense intended by
these critics. It is the law book of the Old Testament, to which, as
even Bleek admits, the book of Deuteronomy forms an appropriate close.
And, in the second place, although the book of Joshua is closely
connected with the Pentateuch, and carries on the history to the
conquest of the promised land by the Israelites, there is evidence that
it is an independent work, in the fact that it repeats the account of
the conquest of the land on the east of Jordan, and its distribution by
Moses among the two tribes and a half, and also of the cities of refuge
which Moses had already appointed in that part of the land, for the
purpose of giving a full and complete account of the fulfilment of the
promise made by God to the patriarchs, that their seed should receive
the land of Canaan for a possession; and still more in the peculiarities
of language by which it is obviously distinguished from the books of
Moses. In the book of Joshua not only do we find none of the archaisms
which run pretty uniformly through all the books of the Pentateuch, such
as הוּא for היא, נער for נערה, האל for האלּה, and other words which are
peculiar to the Pentateuch; but we find, on the other hand, words and
expressions which never occur in the Pentateuch, e.g., the constant form
יריחי ([Jos 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001.md), etc., in all
twenty-six times) instead of the form ירחי, which is quite as uniformly
adopted in the Pentateuch ([Num 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001.md);
[Num 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#003), etc., in all eleven times.md):
also ממלכוּת, for the kingdom of Sihon and Og ([Jos
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#012.md), [Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md), [Jos
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027.md), [Jos
13:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#030).md), instead of ממלכת ([Num
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#033.md); [Deu
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004.md), [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010), etc..md); קנּוא ([Jos
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#019).md) instead of קנּא ([Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md); [Exo
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#014.md); [Deu

6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#027.md); [Jos

29:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#013), etc..md); ירא ([Jos
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#025).md) for יראה ([Deu
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010.md); [Deu
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#026), etc..md); and lastly, החיל גּבּורי
([Jos 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#014.md); [Jos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#002.md); [Jos
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003.md); [Jos
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#007).md) for חיל בּני ([Deu
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#018).md); נאד, a bottle ([Jos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#004.md), [Jos
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#013).md), for חמת ([Gen
21:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md), [Gen
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#019).md); hitsiyt, to set on fire or
burn ([Jos 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#008.md), [Jos
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#019).md); צנח, to spring down ([Jos
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#018).md); קצין, a prince or leader ([Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024).md); שׁקט, to rest ([Jos
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#023.md); [Jos
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015).md); and other words besides, which
you seek for in vain in the Pentateuch, whereas they frequently occur in
the later books.

(Note: How completely the hypothesis that the book of Joshua was written
by the Deuteronomist is wrecked on these differences in language, is
evident even from the attempts which have been made to set them aside.
For example, when Sthelin observes that the later editor retained the
form ירחי in the Pentateuch as he found it in the original work, whereas
in the book of Joshua he altered the original work into the form he
commonly used, this assumption is just as incredible as the hitherto
unheard of assertion that the archaistic use of הוּא as a feminine
instead of היא is traceable to a later form. What can have induced the
later editor, then, to alter the form ממלכת, which he so commonly uses
in Deuteronomy, into ממלכוּת in Joshua? The "reliable" Bleek prefers,
therefore, to take no notice of these differences, or at least to
express no opinion about them.)

Whilst the independence of the book of Joshua is thus placed beyond all
doubt, its internal unity, or the singleness of the authorship, is
evident in general from the arrangement and connection of the contents,
as shown above, and in particular from the fact, that in the different
parts of the book we neither meet with material differences or
discrepancies, nor are able to detect two different styles. The attempt
which was formerly made by De Wette, Hauff, and others, to show that
there were material discrepancies in the different parts, has been
almost entirely given up by Bleek and Sthelin in their introductions.
What Bleek still notices in this respect, in chs. 3 and 4, Josh 8:1-29
and other passages, will be examined in our exposition of the chapters
in question, along with the arguments which Knobel employs against the
unity of the book. The many traces of different modes of thought which
were adduced by Sthelin in 1843, have been dropped in his special
introduction (1862): the only one that he insists upon now is the fact,
that the way in which Joshua acts in [Jos
18:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md) is very different from [Jos
14:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md) ff.; and that in the
historical sections, as a rule, Joshua is described as acting very
differently from what would be expected from [Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md), inasmuch as he acts quite
independently, and never asks the high priest to give him an answer
through the Urim and Thummim. This remark is so far correct, that
throughout the whole book, and not merely in the historical sections,
Joshua is never said to have inquired the will of the Lord through the
medium of the Urim and Thummim of the high priest, and Eleazar is not
mentioned at all in the historical portions. But it does not follow from
this that there is any such difference in the mode of thought as would
point to a difference of authorship. For, on the one hand, Joshua is
blamed in [Jos 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#014.md) for having made a
treaty with the Gibeonites, without asking at the mouth of Jehovah, and
in this there is evidently a gentle allusion to [Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md); and on the other hand, even
[Num 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md) by no means implies that
God would only make known His will to Joshua through the Urim and
Thummim: so that when Joshua is there referred to the high priest for
instructions, all other communications, such as those which he received
directly from the Lord with regard to the conquest and division of
Canaan, are thereby precluded. If the Lord made known to him what he was
to do in this respect, partly by the direct communication of His will,
and partly by His angel ([Jos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013)..md),
there was no occasion at all for Eleazar to be mentioned in the
historical portion of the book, since the direction of the army to fight
battles and conquer towns did not form part of the official functions of
the high priest, even if he did accompany Joshua in his campaigns. In
the geographical portion, however, Eleazar is only mentioned in
connection with the committee of heads of the nation appointed according
to the law in [Num 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#017.md). for the
distribution of the land ([Jos 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md);
[Jos 19:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#051.md); [Jos
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001).md); and even here he does not stand
out with any peculiar prominence, as Joshua was still at the head of the
whole nation when this was performed ([Jos
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001.md), [Jos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007).md). Consequently, not only did
Caleb apply to Joshua with the request for the inheritance promised him
by the Lord ([Jos 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006)..md); but even in
other cases, where there was no reason for enumerating the different
members of the commission for dividing the land, Joshua is mentioned as
appointing and superintending the casting of the lots ([Jos
18:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#003.md); [Jos
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001).md).

The proofs adduced of the "double style" of the book are equally weak.
The principal ones are the fact, that the word generally used for tribe
in the historical sections is shebet, whereas matteh is the word
employed in the geographical sections, and that in the latter the word
machaloketh is altogether wanting ([Jos
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#023.md); [Jos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007).md). But the interchange of shebet
and matteh may be fully explained from the difference in the meaning of
these two words, shebet denoting the tribe as a political corporation,
possessing independence and power, and matteh having simple regard to
its genealogical aspect-a distinction which is not overthrown by the
assurance, that "in [Jos 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#014.md), [Jos
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#016.md), [Jos
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#018.md), and [Jos
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001.md), as compared with [Jos
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#029.md), and in [Jos
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#012.md), as compared with [Num
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#018.md), the charge is perfectly
arbitrary." But whether it be involuntary or carefully considered, there
is no ground for inferring that there have been two writers engaged upon
the work, for the simple reason that both words occur in the historical
as well as the geographical sections-sometimes, in fact, in the very
same verse, e.g., [Jos 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#029.md) and [Num
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#002.md), where we cannot possibly imagine
a fusion of different documents to have taken place. (For further
remarks, see at [Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001)..md) The word
machaloketh, however, is not synonymous with mishpachah, as Sthelin
supposes, but denotes the various subdivisions of the tribes into
families, fathers' houses and families; and this also not only occurs in
[Jos 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#023.md) and [Jos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md), but in the geographical portion
also, in [Jos 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#010.md). The other remark,
viz., that "in the place of the אבות ראשׁי, who are the leading actors
in the geographical sections, we find the elders, judges, heads ראשׁים
and שׁטרים in the historical, or else simply the shoterim ([Jos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010.md); [Jos
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002.md); [Jos
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#033.md); [Jos
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#002.md); [Jos
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001).md), or the elders," is neither
quite correct, nor in the least degree conclusive. It is incorrect,
inasmuch as even in the geographical portion, namely [Jos
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#004.md), the נשׂיאים are mentioned
instead of the raa'sheey 'aabowt, along with Eleazar and Joshua. But the
notion upon which this argument is founded is still more erroneous,
viz., that "the נשׂיאים, אבות ראשׁי, זקנים, שׁפטים and שׁטרים are all
the same, as we may clearly see from [Deu
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#015.md);" for the identity of the terms
elders and heads with the terms judges and officers (shoterim) cannot
possibly be inferred from this passage, in which the judges and shoterim
are said to have been chosen from the elders of the nation. Even the
"heads of the fathers' houses" (see at [Exo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014).md) were only a section of the
princes and heads of the nation, and those mentioned in the book of
Joshua are simply those who were elected as members of the distribution
committee, and who are naturally referred to in connection with the
division of the land by lot; whereas the judges and shoterim had nothing
to do with it, and for this very reason are not mentioned at all in the
geographical sections. - And if, instead of confining ourselves to the
words, we turn our attention to the facts, all the peculiarities that we
meet with in the different parts of the book may be explained in this
way, and the seeming differences brought into harmony. In a work which
embraces two such different subjects as the forcible conquest and the
peaceable distribution of the land of Canaan, the same ideas and
expression cannot possibly be constantly recurring, if the words are to
be at all in conformity with the actual contents. And not the smallest
conclusion can be drawn from such differences as these with regard to
the composition of the book; much less can they be adduced as proofs of
diversity of authorship. Moreover, the unity of authorship is not to be
overthrown by proving, or showing it to be probable, that the author
made use of written documents for some of the sections, - such, for
example, as the official records prepared for the distribution of the
land by lot, - in his description of the possession of the different
tribes.

Lastly, the historical fidelity of the book of Joshua cannot justly be
called in question; and so far as all the narratives and descriptions
are concerned, which lie within the sphere of the ordinary laws of
nature, this is generally admitted. This applies not only to the
description oft he possessions of the different tribes according to
their boundaries and towns, which are almost universally acknowledged to
have been derived from authentic records, but to such historical
passages as the words of Caleb ([Jos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006)..md), the address of Phinehas, and
the reply of the two tribes and a half (Josh 22), the complaint of the
children of Joseph on account of the smallness of the possessions that
had fallen to their lot, and Joshua's answer ([Jos
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014)..md), which are so thoroughly
original, and so perfectly appropriate to the persons and circumstances,
that their historical credibility cannot be disputed.

(Note: Even Eichhorn, for example, says in his Introduction, "The words
of Caleb, in [Jos 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md)., in which he
asks for the inheritance that had been promised him, bear too strongly
the characteristics of an appeal from the mouth of an old man of eighty
years of age, and breathe too thoroughly in every word his spirit, and
age, and peculiar situation, for it to be possible that it should be
merely the composition of a later writer, who placed himself in
imagination in his situation, and put the words into his mouth.")

It is chiefly at the miraculous occurrences that the opponents of the
biblical revelation have taken offence: partly therefore because of the
miracles themselves, and partly because the statement that God commanded
the destruction of the Canaanites is irreconcilable with correct (?)
views of the Godhead, they deny the historical character of the whole
book. But the miracles recorded in this book do not stand alone; on the
contrary, they are most intimately connected with the great work of
divine revelation, and the redemption of the human race; so that it is
only through unscriptural assumptions as to the character of God, and
His operations in nature and the world of men, that they can be
pronounced unreal, or altogether denied.

And the objection, that the destruction of the Canaanites, as an act
commanded by God, "cannot be reconciled even with only half correct
notions of the Deity," as Eichhorn maintains, rests upon totally
unscriptural and irrational views of God and the divine government,
which deny a priori all living influence on the part of the "Deity" upon
the earth and its inhabitants. But the true God is not a Deity who can
neither help nor injure men ([Jer
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005).md); He is the almighty creator,
preserver, and governor of the world. This God was Jehovah, who chose
Israel for His own people, "a living God, an everlasting King" ([Jer
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010).md); who not only fixed for the
nations the bounds of their habitations, but their appointed times as
well, that they should seek Him, if haply they might feel after Him, and
find Him ([Deu 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md); [Act
17:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026).md); who, because He has given
to every nation upon earth life and being, property and land, to be
rightly used, and to promote their own happiness through the
glorification of the name of God, possesses both the power and the right
to deprive them of all their possessions, and wipe out every trace of
them from the earth, if they dishonour and disgrace the name of God by
an obstinate abuse of the blessings and gifts entrusted to them. Thus
the only true God, who judges the earth in eternally unchangeable wisdom
and righteousness, and manifests His wrath in great judgments, as well
as His mercy in innumerable blessings to all the children of men, had
promised to Abraham that He would give him the land of Canaan for a
possession for his seed the children of Israel, when the iniquity of the
Amorites, who possessed it at that time, was full, i.e., had reached its
full measure ([Gen 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md); [Gen
15:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013).md). The expulsion of the
Canaanites, therefore, from possessions which they had no doubt
rightfully held, but to which they had forfeited their right through the
misuse they had made of them, is to be regarded quite as decidedly as an
act of penal justice on the part of God, as the presentation of this
land to Israel was an act of His free grace; and the destruction of the
Canaanites by the Israelites, as well as their capture of the possession
which the Canaanites had forfeited through their sins (vid., [Lev
18:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024.md); [Deu
12:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029).md), was perfectly justifiable,
if, as our book affirms, the Israelites were only acting as instruments
in the hands of the Lord. It is true they were not warranted in carrying
on a war of extermination against the Canaanites simply because the land
had been given them by God, any more than David was warranted in putting
Saul to death and wresting the kingdom from him, although he had been
rejected by the Lord, simply because Samuel had promised him the kingdom
by the command of God, and had even anointed him king over Israel. But
the Israelites did not proceed from Egypt to Canaan of their own accord,
or by their own power; they were brought out of this land of their
bondage by the God of their fathers with a mighty arm, and led by Him
through the wilderness into the promised land. Joshua acted, as Moses
had done before him, by the immediate command of God; and the fact that
this command was real and well-founded, and not a mere fancy, is proved
by the miraculous signs through which God accredited the armies of
Israel as the servants of His judicial righteousness, who were fighting
in His name and by His command, when the Lord of the whole earth divided
the waters of Jordan before them, threw down the walls of Jericho,
filled the Canaanites with fear and despair, killed them with hailstones
at Gibeon, and brought to nought all their plans and endeavours to
resist the advance of Israel, so that Joshua smote great and mighty
nations, and no one could stand before him. Hence the Psalmist was able
to write, "Thou didst drive out the heathen with Thy hand, and plantedst
them (the Israelites); Thou hast destroyed nations, and cast them out.
For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did
their own arm help them; but Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the
light of Thy countenance, because Thou hadst a favour unto them" ([Psa
44:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002).md). - And whilst the Israelites
were thus proved to be the executors of the penal judgments of God, they
acted in perfect accordance with this vocation by the manner in which
they carried out the judgment entrusted to them. They submitted
cheerfully and obediently to all the appointments of Joshua; they
sanctified themselves by the circumcision of all who had remained
uncircumcised in the desert and by keeping the passover at Gilgal; they
set up the law of the Lord upon Ebal and Gerizim; they executed the ban
upon the Canaanites, as the Lord had commanded, and punished Achan and
his house for transgressing this ban, that they might expunge the sin
from their midst; they vowed, in the most solemn manner, that when they
had come into peaceable possession of the promised inheritance, they
would renounce all idolatry, would serve Jehovah their God alone, and
would hearken to His voice, to renew the covenant with the Lord; and
they served the Lord as long as Joshua lived, and the elders after him,
who knew all the works of the Lord which He had done for Israel. - (For
further remarks upon this subject, see Hengstenberg's Dissertations on
the Pentateuch, vol. ii. pp. 387-417, Eng. trans., Art. "On the Right of
the Israelites to Palestine.")

Thus the contents of the book have their higher unity and their truth in
the idea of the justice, holiness, and grace of God, as they were
manifested in the most glorious manner in the great historical event
which forms the subject of the whole. Whilst justice was revealed in the
case of the Canaanites, and grace in that of the Israelites, the
holiness of the Almighty God was manifested in both, - in the
Canaanites, who were liable to judgment, through their destruction; and
in the Israelites, who were chosen to fellowship with the Lord, through
the sanctification of their lives to the faithful performance of the
duties of their vocation, both to the honour of God and the glory of His
name.

The different views that have been expressed as to the time when the
book was written are given more fully in Keil's Commentary on Joshua
(1847, Eng. trans. 1857), where the exegetical aids are also given.
