### [Jeremiah Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 45:1</span></span>

"The word which Jeremiah the prophet spake to Baruch the son of Neriah,
when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the
fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, [Jer
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#002.md). Thus saith Jahveh, the God of
Israel, to thee, O Baruch: V. 3. Thou saidst, Woe to me now! for Jahveh
hath added sorrow to my pain: I am weary with sighing, and no rest do I
find. V. 4. Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus saith Jahveh: Behold,
what I have built I will destroy, and what I have planted I will pluck
up, and that is the whole earth. V. 5. And thou seekest great things for
thyself: seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh,
saith Jahveh; but I will give thy life unto thee for booty in all places
whither thou shalt go."

From the superscription in [Jer 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001.md),
it appears that this word of God came to Baruch through Jeremiah the
prophet, in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, when Baruch was
writing out, or had written out, in a book-roll the prophecies that had
been uttered by Jeremiah up till that time. It is not necessarily
implied in the infin. בּכתבו that the word of God came during the
transcription, while he was still engaged in writing: it may also mean,
"when he was ready with the writing," had got done with it; and Hitzig
is wrong when he rejects as "misleading" the view which Movers takes -
"when he had written." The writing down of the addresses of Jeremiah in
the year mentioned is related in Jer 36; thus the substance of this
chapter and that of Jer 36 agree. "These words" can only be the
addresses (words) of Jeremiah which Baruch was then writing down. From
this, Hitzig, Graf, Ngelsbach, and others, infer that this small piece
was the last in the copy of Jeremiah's prophecies originally prepared
under Jehoiakim, - if not of the first one which was intended to be read
in the temple, at least of the second copy which was made after the
former one had been destroyed; and that it was only after the collection
had been enlarged to the extent of the collection handed down to us,
that this portion was affixed as an appendix to the end of the
prophecies of Jeremiah which relate to his own country. But this
inference is not a valid one. "These words" are the addresses of the
prophet in general, which Baruch wrote down; and that only those which
were uttered up to the fourth year of Jehoiakim are intended, is
implied, not in the demonstrative "these," but in the date given
afterwards, by which "these" is further specified. In [Jer
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001.md) it is merely stated that at that
time the word of God, given below, came to Jeremiah, and through Him to
Baruch, but not that Baruch wrote down this also on that occasion, and
appended it to the roll of Jeremiah's prophecies which had been prepared
at his dictation. It may have been written down much later, possibly not
till the whole of Jeremiah's prophecies were collected and arranged in
Egypt. Moreover, the position occupied by this chapter in the collection
shows that this message of comfort to Baruch was added as an appendix to
those predictions of Jeremiah which concern Judah and Israel.

The occasion for this message of comfort addressed to the prophet's
attendant is pointed out in [Jer 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#003.md),
in the words which Baruch had uttered: "Woe to me! for Jahveh adds
sorrow to my pain." Baruch felt "pain," i.e., pain of soul, at the moral
corruption of the people, their impenitence and obduracy in sin and
vice, just like the prophet himself, [Jer
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018.md). To this pain God adds sorrow,
by threatening the judgment which shall fall on Judah for sin, and which
was even then beginning to break over the land; cf. [Jer
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#018.md). Baruch sighs over this till he
is wearied, and finds no rest; cf. [Lam
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#005.md). "I am weary with my sighing," is
a reminiscence from [Psa 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007.md). This
sorrow in addition to his pain was not caused in him for the first time
by writing down the discourses of the prophet, but was rather thus
freshened and increased. The answer of the Lord to this sighing is of a
stern character, yet soothing for Baruch. The sentence of destruction
has been determined on. What the Lord has built He will now destroy: it
is not said why, since the reason was sufficiently known from the
prophet's utterances. As to the expression in [Jer
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#004.md), cf. [Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md); [Jer
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028.md). The destruction regards the
whole earth, היא ואת־כּל־הארץ, lit., "and as regards the whole earth, it
is it," namely that I destroy. On the employment of את in introducing
the subject, cf. [Dan 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#013.md); [Hag
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005.md), and Ewald, 277 d. כּל־הארץ does
not mean "the whole land," but "the whole earth:" this is indubitably
evident from the parallel "upon all flesh," [Jer
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005.md), i.e., the whole of humanity, as
in [Jer 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md). The sentence is passed
on all the earth, in accordance with the announcement made in [Jer
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md).

[Jeremiah 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 45:5</span></span>

But when the judgment extends over the whole of humanity, an individual
man cannot ask for anything great. "To seek for great things," i.e., to
ask for things which in general or under certain circumstances are
unattainable (cf. [Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001).md), is here
used with reference to worldly prosperity. When the whole world is
visited with judgment, an individual man must not make great demands,
but be content with saving his life. This is promised to Baruch in [Jer
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005.md), to alleviate his pain and
sorrow. "To give life to any one for booty," means to let him escape
with his life; cf. [Jer 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009.md); [Jer
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002.md); [Jer
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018.md). In the words, "in all places
whither thou shalt go," it is intimated that he will be obliged to avoid
destruction by flight, but will thereby save his life.
