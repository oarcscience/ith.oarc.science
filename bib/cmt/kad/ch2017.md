Jehoshaphat's Reign - 2 Chronicles 17-20

Jehoshaphat laboured to strengthen the kingdom both within and without.
Not only did he place soldiers in the fenced cities, and removed the
high places and the Astartes, but sought also to diffuse the knowledge
of the law among the people, and by building castles and the possession
of a well-equipped army, firmly to establish his power (2 Chron 17). In
the course of years he married into the family of Ahab king of Israel,
and, while on a visit in Samaria, allowed himself to be persuaded by
Ahab to enter upon a joint war against the Syrians at Ramoth in Gilead,
in which he all but lost his life, while King Ahab was mortally wounded
in the battle (2 Chron 18). Censured on his return to Jerusalem by the
prophet Jehu for this alliance with the godless Ahab, he sought still
more earnestly to lead back his people to Jahve, the God of their
fathers, bestirring himself to bring the administration of justice into
a form in accordance with the law of God, and establishing a supreme
tribunal in Jerusalem ([Ch2 19:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001).md).
Thereafter, when the Moabites and Ammonites, with the Edomites and other
desert tribes, made an inroad into Judah, the Lord gave him a wonderful
victory over these enemies. At a later time he yet again allied himself
with the Israelitish king Ahaziah for the restoration of the commerce
with Ophir; but the ships built for this purpose were broken in the
harbour, so that the voyage was abandoned (2 Chron 20). Of all these
enterprises of Jehoshaphat, none are mentioned in the book of Kings
except the campaign entered upon with Ahab against Ramoth in Gilead,
which is found in the history of Ahab, 1 Kings 22:2-35. Jehoshaphat's
reign itself is only characterized generally, but in such a way as to
agree with the account in the Chronicle; and, in conclusion, the
alliance with Ahaz for the purpose of making the voyage to Ophir is
shortly narrated in [Kg1 22:41-53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#041.md), but
in a form which differs considerably from that in which it is
communicated in the Chronicle.

[2 Chronicles 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 17:1</span></span>

Jehoshaphat's efforts to strengthen the kingdom, internally and
externally. - [Ch2 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001.md), or rather the
first half of this verse, belongs properly to the preceding chapter,
since, when the son immediately follows the father on the throne, the
successor is mentioned immediately: cf. [Ch2
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#031.md); [Ch2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#016.md); [Ch2
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#027.md); [Ch2
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#009.md), etc. Here, however, the account
of the accession to the throne is combined with a general remark on the
reign of the successor, and therefore it is placed at the commencement
of the account of the reign; while in the case of Asa ([Ch2
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001).md) both come in immediately at the
conclusion of the reign of his predecessor. Asa had shown himself weak
against Israel, as he had sought help against Baasha's attack from the
Syrians ([Ch2 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001)..md), but it was
otherwise with Jehoshaphat. He indeed put the fenced cities of his
kingdom in a thoroughly good condition for defence, to protect his
kingdom against hostile attacks from without (v. 20: but he walked at
the same time in the ways of the Lord, so that the Lord made his kingdom
strong and mighty ([Ch2 17:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#003).md). This
general characterization of his reign is in [Ch2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006.md) illustrated by facts: first by
the communication of what Jehoshaphat did for the inner spiritual
strengthening of the kingdom, by raising the standard of religion and
morals among the people ([Ch2
17:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006).md), and then by what he did for
the external increase of his power ([Ch2
17:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#012).md).

[2 Chronicles 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 17:2</span></span>

He placed forces (חיל) in all the fenced cities of Judah, and garrisons
(נציבים, military posts; cf. [Ch1
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#016).md) in the land of Judah, and in
the cities of Ephraim, which is father Asa had taken; cf. [Ch2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008.md). God blessed these undertakings.
Jahve was with him, because he walked in the ways of David his ancestor,
the former ways, and sought not the Baals. The former ways of David are
his ways in the earlier years of his reign, in contrast to the later
years, in which his adultery with Bathsheba (2 Sam. 11) and the sin of
numbering the people (1 Chron 21) fall. הבּעלים are all false gods, in
contrast to Jahve, the one God of Israel; and here the word designates
not only the Baal-worship properly so called, but also the worship of
Jahve by means of images, by which Jahve is brought down to the level of
the Baals; cf. [Jdg 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md). The ל before
בּעלים stands, according to the later usage, as a sign of the
accusative. In the last clause of [Ch2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#004.md), "and not after the doings of
Israel" (of the ten tribes), הלך, "he walked," is to be repeated. The
doing of Israel is the worship of Jahve through the images of the golden
calves, which the author of the Chronicle includes in the לבּעלים דּרשׁ.

[2 Chronicles 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 17:5</span></span>

Therefore Jahve established the kingdom in his hand, i.e., under his
rule; cf. [Kg2 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#005.md). All Judah brought
him presents. מנחה, often used of tribute of subject peoples, e.g., in
[Ch2 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#011.md) of the Philistines, cannot
here have that signification; nor can it denote the regular imposts of
subjects, for these are not called מנחה; but must denote voluntary gifts
which his subjects brought him as a token of their reverence and love.
The last clause, "and there was to him (he attained) riches and honour
in abundance," which is repeated [Ch2
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001.md), recalls [Ch1
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#028.md); [Ch2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012.md), and signifies that Jehoshaphat,
like his ancestors David and Solomon, was blessed for walking in the
pious ways of these his forefathers.

[2 Chronicles 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 17:6</span></span>

This blessing encouraged Jehoshaphat to extirpate from the land all
idolatrous worship, and to teach the people the law of the Lord. לב
נּבהּ, usually sensu malo, to be haughty, proud, cf. e.g., [Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016.md); [Ch2
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md); here sensu bono, of rising
courage to advance in ways pleasing to God: and he removed the high
places also, etc. עוד points back to [Ch2
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#003.md) : not only did he himself keep
far from the Baals, but he removed, besides, all memorials of the
Baal-worship from Judah. On בּמות and אשׁרים, see on [Ch2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#002.md).

[Ch2 17:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007.md)

In the third year of his reign he sent five princes, i.e., laymen of
high position, with nine Levites and two priests, into the cities of
Judah, with the book of the law, to teach the law everywhere to the
people. בּן־חיל is nom. prop., like בּן־חסד, [Kg1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#010.md), בּן־דּקר, [Kg1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#009.md), and is not to be translated as an
adjective, as in lxx and Syr., partly on account of the ל praef., and
still more on account of the singular, for the plural חיל בּני must be
used when it is in apposition to לשׂרי. Nothing further is known of the
men named; the designation of them as שׂרים suggests the idea that they
were heads of families or fathers'-houses. אדוניּה טוב, too ([Ch2
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#008).md), is one name. The "book of the
law of Jahve" is the Pentateuch, not merely a collection of Mosaic laws,
since in Jehoshaphat's time the Mosaic book of the law (the Pentateuch)
had been long in existence. יהוּדה בּערי סבב signifies to go through the
cities of Judah in different directions; baa\`aam limeed, to teach among
the people (not the people). The mission of these men is called by the
older theologians a solemn ecclesiarum visitatio, quam Josaphat
laudabili exemplo per universum regnum suum instituit, and they differ
in opinion only as to the part played by the princes in it. Vitringa, de
synagoga vet. p. 389, in agreement with Rashi, thinks that only the
Levites and priests were deputed ut docerent; the princes, ut
auctoritate imperioque suo populum erudiendum in officio continerent
eumque de seria regis voluntate certiorem facerent; while others, e.g.,
Buddaeus, refer to [Ch2 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#009.md), ubi
principes pariter ac Levitae populum docuisse dicuntur, or believe with
Grotius, docere et explicare legem non tantum sacerdotum erat et
Levitarum, sed omnium eruditorum. Both views contain elements of truth,
and do not mutually exclude each other, but may be harmonized. We can
hardly confine למּד to religious teaching. The Mosaic law contains a
number of merely civil precepts, as to which laymen learned in the law
might impart instruction; and consequently the teaching probably
consisted not merely in making the people acquainted with the contents
of the law, but at the same time of direction and guidance in keeping
the law, and generally in restoring and confirming the authority of the
law among the people. In connection with this there were many abuses and
illegalities which had to be broken down and removed; so that in this
respect the task of the commission sent round the country by Jehoshaphat
may be compared to a church inspection, if only we understand thereby
not an inspection of churches in the Christian sense of the words, but
an inspection of the religious and moral life of the communities of
Israel under the old covenant.

[2 Chronicles 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 17:10</span></span>

This attempt of Jehoshaphat brought him this blessing, that the terror
of Jahve fell upon all the surrounding kingdoms; and not only did none
of the neighbouring peoples venture to make war upon him, but also
various tribes did homage to him by presents. Ramb. has already so
understood the connection of these verses (erat hoc praemium pietatis
Josaphati, quod vicini satisque potentes hostes non auderent adversus
ipsum hiscere); while Berth. fails to apprehend it, saying that
Jehoshaphat had time to care for the instruction of his people, because
at that time the neighbouring peoples did not venture to undertake war
against Judah. The words "terror of Jahve," cf. [Ch2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#013.md); [Ch2
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#029.md), and "all the kingdoms of the
lands," cf. [Ch2 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#008.md), [Ch1
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#030.md), are expressions peculiar to the
author of the Chronicle, which show that by these remarks he is
preparing the way for a transition to a more detailed portrayal of
Jehoshaphat's political power. מן־פּלשׁתּים is subject, מן partitive:
some of the Philistines brought him presents (for מנחה see on [Ch2
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#005).md), "and silver a burden," i.e., in
great quantity. משּׂא does not signify tribute, vectigal argento
(Vulg.), for the word has not that signification, but denotes burden,
that which can be carried, as in משּׂא לאן, [Ch2
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#025.md). - ערביאים or ערביּים, [Ch2
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007.md), and more usually ערבים, [Ch2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md); [Ch2
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md), are Arabian nomadic tribes
(Bedwin), perhaps those whom Asa, after his victory over the Cushite
Zerah, had brought under the kingdom of Judah, [Ch2
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#014.md). These paid their tribute in
small cattle, rams, and he-goats. (תּישׁים, [Gen
30:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#035.md); [Gen
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#015.md); [Pro
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#031)..md)

[2 Chronicles 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 17:12</span></span>

Description of Jehoshaphat's power. - [Ch2
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#012.md). And Jehoshaphat became ever
greater, sc. in power. The partic. הולך expresses the continuous advance
in greatness, cf. Ew. 280, b, as the infin. absol. does elsewhere, e.g.,
[Gen 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#003.md). למעלה עד as in [Ch2
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012.md). - He built castles in Judah.
בּירניּות, only here and in [Ch2 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#004.md),
from בּירנית, derivative formed from בּירה by the Syriac termination
נית-, fem. of ן-: castle, fortress. On מסכּנות ערי cf. [Ch2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004.md).

[Ch2 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#013.md)

וגו רבּה וּמלעכה is rightly translated by Luther, "und hatte viel
Vorraths" (and had much store). מלעכה denotes here, as in [Exo
22:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#007.md), property, that which has been
gained by work or business. The signification, much work, opera magna
(Vulg., Cler., etc.), as also Bertheau's translation, "the works for
equipping and provisioning the fortresses," correspond neither to the
context nor to the parallel (synonymous) second member of the verse. The
work and trouble necessary to equip the cities of Judah does not
correspond to "the valiant warriors in Jerusalem;" the only parallel is
the goods and property which were in these cities, the provision of
victuals and war material there stored up.

[Ch2 17:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#014.md)

The men fit for war passed in review according to their fathers'-houses.
The male population of Judah fell into three divisions, that of Benjamin
into two. The prince Adnah held the first place among the generals, with
300,000 men of Judah. ידו על, at his hand, i.e., with and under him,
Jehohanan had the command of 280,000 men, and Amasiah over 200,000. השׂר
is a contraction for אלפים שׂר. For what special reason it is so
honourably recorded of Amasiah that he had willingly offered himself to
the Lord (cf. for התנדּב, [Jdg 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#009).md)
has not been communicated.

[Ch2 17:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#017.md)

The Benjamites fell into two detachments: archers with shields (cf. [Ch1
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040).md) 200,000 men, under the chief
command of Eliada, and "equipped of the army," i.e., not heavy armed
(Berth.), but provided with the usual weapons, sword, spear, and shield
(cf. [Ch1 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#024).md), 180,000 under the
command of Jehozabad. According to this statement, Judah had 780,000
warriors capable of bearing arms. These numbers are clearly too large,
and bear no proportion to the result of the numbering of the people
capable of bearing arms under David, when there were in Judah only
500,000 or 470,000 men (cf. [Ch1 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#005.md)
with [Sa2 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#005).md); yet the sums of the
single divisions appear duly proportioned-a fact which renders it more
difficult to believe that these exaggerated numbers are the result of
orthographical errors.

[Ch2 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#019.md)

These were serving the king. אלּה refers not to the above-mentioned men
capable of bearing arms, for sheereet is not used of service in war, but
to the commanders whom he had placed in the fortified cities of all
Judah, "in which probably bodies of the above-mentioned troops lay as
garrisons" (Berth.).
