### [Isaiah Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 48:1</span></span>

This third portion of the trilogy ([Isa
46:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md), [Isa
47:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001), 48.md) stands in the same
relation to [Isa 47:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md), as [Isa
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003.md). to [Isa
46:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md). The prophecy is addressed to
the great body of the captives. "Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are
called by the name of Israel, and have flowed out of the waters of
Judah, who swear by the name of Jehovah, and extol the God of Israel,
not in truth and not in righteousness! For they call themselves of the
holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel, Jehovah of hosts
His name." The summons to hear is based upon the Israelitish nationality
of those who are summoned, to which they still cling, and upon the
relation in which they place themselves to the God of Israel. This gives
to Jehovah the right to turn to them, and imposes upon them the duty to
hearken to Him. The blame, inserted by the way, points at the same time
to the reason for the address which follows, and to the form which it
necessarily assumes. "The house of Jacob" is not all Israel, as the
following words clearly show, but, as in [Isa
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003.md), the house of Judah, which shared
in the honourable name of Israel, but have flowed out of the waters,
i.e., the source of Judah. The summons, therefore, is addressed to the
Judaean exiles in Babylon, and that inasmuch as they swear by the name
of Jehovah, and remember the God of Israel with praise (hizkı̄r b' as in
[Psa 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008).md), though not in truth and
not in righteousness ([Kg1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006.md); [Zac
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#008).md), i.e., without their state of
mind (cf., [Isa 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#003.md); [Jer
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#041).md) or mode of action corresponding
to their confession, so as to prove that it was sincerely and seriously
meant. The praise bestowed upon the persons summoned, which is somewhat
spoiled by this, is explained in [Isa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#002.md); they call themselves after the
holy city (this title is applied to Jerusalem both here and in [Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md), as well as in the books of
Daniel and Nehemiah). We may easily supply here, that the holiness of
the city laid an obligation upon its citizens to be holy in their
character and conduct. They also relied upon the God of Israel, whose
name is Jehovah Zebaoth; and therefore He would require of them the
fullest confidence and deepest reverence.

[Isaiah 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 48:3</span></span>

After this summons, and description of those who are summoned, the
address of Jehovah begins. "The first I have long ago proclaimed, and it
has gone forth out of my mouth, and I caused it to be heard. I carried
it out suddenly, and it came to pass. Because I knew that thou art hard,
and thy neck an iron clasp, and thy brow of brass; I proclaimed it to
thee long ago; before it came to pass, I caused thee to hear it, that
thou mightest not say, My idol has done it, and my graven image and
molten image commanded it." The word הראשׁנות in itself signifies simply
priora; and then, according to the context, it signifies prius facta
([Isa 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#009).md), or prius praedicta ([Isa
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009).md), or prius eventura ([Isa
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022.md); [Isa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009).md). In the present passage it
refers to earlier occurrences, which Jehovah had foretold, and, when the
time fixed for their accomplishment arrived, which He had immediately
brought to pass. With a retrospective glance at this, we find plural
masc. suffixes (cf., [Isa 41:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#027).md) used
interchangeably with plural fem. (cf., [Isa
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#007.md) and [Isa
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016).md); the prophet more frequently
uses the sing. fem. in this neuter sense ([Isa
41:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#020.md); [Isa
42:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#023), etc..md), and also, though very
rarely, the sing. masc. ([Isa 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008).md).
On gı̄d, a band, a sinew, but here a clasp (cf., Arab. kaid, a fetter),
see Psychology, p. 233. Nechūshâh is a poetical equivalent for
nechōsheth, as in [Isa 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002.md). The
heathen cravings of Israel, which reached into the captivity, are here
presupposed. Hengstenberg is mistaken in his supposition, that the
prophet's standpoint is always anterior to the captivity when he speaks
in condemnation of idolatry. We cannot draw any conclusion from the
character of the community that returned, with regard to that of the
people of the captivity generally. The great mass even of Judah, and
still more of Israel, remained behind, and became absorbed into the
heathen, to whom they became more and more assimilated. And does not
Ezekiel expressly state in [Eze
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#030.md)., that the golah by the Chaboras
defiled themselves with the same abominations of idolatry as their
fathers, and that the prevailing disposition was to combine the worship
of Jehovah with heathenism, or else to exchange the former altogether
for the latter? And we know that it was just the same with the exiles in
Egypt, among whom the life and labours of Jeremiah terminated. Wherever
the prophet speaks of פשׁעים and רשׁעים, these names invariably include
a tendency or falling away to Babylonian idolatry, to which he describes
the exiles as having been addicted, both in [Isa
66:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#017.md) and elsewhere.

[Isaiah 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 48:6</span></span>

But in order to determine exactly what "the former things" were, which
Jehovah had foretold in order that Israel might not ascribe them to this
idol or the other, we must add [Isa
48:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#006.md) : "Thou hast heard it, look
then at it all; and ye, must ye not confess it? I give thee new things
to hear from this time forth, and hidden things, and what thou didst not
know. It is created now, and not long ago; and thou hast not heard it
before, that thou mightest not say, Behold, I knew it. Thou hast neither
heard it, nor known it, nor did thine ear open itself to it long ago:
for I knew thou art altogether faithless, and thou art called rebellious
from the womb." The meaning of the question in [Isa
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#006.md) is very obvious: they must
acknowledge and attest, even thou against their will ([Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md); [Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008).md), that Jehovah has foretold all
that is now confirmed by the evident fulfilment. Consequently the
"former things" are the events experienced by the people from the very
earliest times ([Isa 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#009).md) down to the
present times of Cyrus, and more especially the first half or epoch of
this period itself, which expired at the time that formed the prophet's
standpoint. And as the object of the prediction was to guard Israel
against ascribing to its idols that which had taken place (which can
only be understood of events that had occurred in favour of Israel), the
"former things" must include the preparation for the redemption of
Israel from the Babylonian captivity through the revolution brought to
pass by Cyrus. Hence the "new things" will embrace the redemption of
Israel with its attendant circumstances, and that not merely on its
outward side, but on its spiritual side as well; also the glorification
of the redeemed people in the midst of a world of nations converted to
the God of Israel, and the creation of a new heaven and a new earth; in
short, the New Testament aeon (compare עם לברית, lxx εἰς διαθήκην
γένους, [Isa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006).md), with the facts
which contribute to its ultimate completion (f. [Isa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009).md). The announcement and
realization of these absolutely new and hitherto secret things (cf.,
[Rom 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025).md) take place from this time
forward; Israel has not heard of them "before today" (compare מיּום,
"from this day forward," [Isa 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013).md),
that it may not lay claim to the knowledge conveyed to it by prophecy,
as something drawn from itself. This thought is carried to a climax in
[Isa 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md) in three correlated
sentences commencing with "yea" (gam). פּתח signifies patescere here, as
in [Isa 60:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011) (Ewald, 120, a.md). Jehovah
had said nothing to them of this before, because it was to be feared
that, with their faithlessness and tendency to idolatry, which had run
through their entire history, they would only abuse it. This is strange!
On the one hand, the rise of Cyrus is spoken of here as predicted from
of old, because it belonged to the "former things," and as knowable
through prophecy - a statement which favours the opinion that these
addresses were written before the captivity; and, on the other hand, a
distinction is drawn between these "former things" and certain "new
things" that were intentionally not predicted before the expiration of
these "former things," which certainly seems to preclude the possibility
of their having been composed before the captivity; since, as Ruetschi
observes, if "the older Isaiah had predicted this, he would have acted
in direct opposition to Jehovah's design." But in actual fact, the
dilemma in which the opponents of the authenticity of these prophecies
find themselves, is comparatively worse than this. For the principal
objection - namely, that a prophet before the captivity could not
possibly have known or predicted anything concerning Cyrus - cannot be
satisfactorily removed by attributing these prophecies to a prophet of
the time of the captivity, since they expressly and repeatedly affirm
that the rise of Cyrus was an event foreknown and predicted by the God
of prophecy. Now, if it is Isaiah who thus takes his stand directly in
the midst of the captivity, we can understand both of these: viz., the
retrospective glance at previous prophecies, which issued in the rise of
Cyrus that prepared the way for the redemption from Babylon, since, so
far as the prophet was concerned, such prophecies as Isaiah 13-14:23;
[Isa 21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md), and also [Isa
11:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md) ([Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010).md), are fused into one with his
present predictions; and also the prospective glance at prophecies which
are now first to be uttered, and events which are now fore the first
time about to be accomplished; inasmuch as the revelations contained in
these prophecies concerning Israel's pathway through suffering to glory,
more especially so far as they grew out of the idea of the "servant of
Jehovah," might really be set down as absolutely new to the prophet
himself, and never heard of before. Meanwhile our exposition is not
affected by the critical question; for even we most firmly maintain,
that the prophet who is speaking here has his standpoint in the midst of
the captivity, on the boundary line of the condition of suffering and
punishment and its approaching termination.

[Isaiah 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 48:9</span></span>

The people now expiating its offences in exile has been from time
immemorial faithless and inclined to apostasy; nevertheless Jehovah will
save it, and its salvation is therefore an unmerited work of His
compassion. "For my name's sake I lengthen out my wrath, and for my
praise I hold back towards thee, that I may not cut thee off. Behold, I
have refined thee, and not in the manner of silver: I have proved thee
in the furnace of affliction. For mine own sake, for mine own sake I
accomplish it (for how is it profaned!), and my glory I give not to
another." The futures in [Isa 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md)
affirm what Jehovah continually does. He lengthens out His wrath, i.e.,
He retards its outbreak, and thus shows Himself long-suffering. He tames
or chains it (חטם, like Arab. chṭm, root טם, compare domare, root
Sanscr. dam, possibly also to dam or damp) for the sake of Israel, that
He may not exterminate it utterly by letting it loose, and that for the
sake of His name and His praise, which require the carrying out of His
plan to salvation, on which the existence of Israel depends. What Israel
has hitherto experienced has been a melting, the object of which was not
destruction, but testing and refinement. The Beth of בכסף ולא is not
Beth pretii in the sense of "not to gain silver," or "not so that I
should have gained silver as operae pretium," as Umbreit and Ewald
maintain (and even Knobel, who explains it however as meaning "in the
accompaniment of silver," though in the same sense). Such a thought
would be out of place and purposeless here. Nor is Rosenmller's
explanation admissible, viz., "not with silver, i.e., with that force of
fire which is necessary for the smelting out of silver." This is
altogether unsuitable, because the sufferings inflicted upon Israel did
resemble the smelting out of the precious metal (see [Isa
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025).md). The Beth is rather the Beth
essentiae, which may be rendered by tanquam, and introduces the
accusative predicate in this instance, just as it introduces the
nominative predicate in the substantive clause of [Job
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013.md), and the verbal clause of [Psa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md). Jehovah melted Israel, but not
like silver (not as men melt silver); the meaning of which is, not that
He melted it more severely, i.e., even more thoroughly, than silver, as
Stier explains it, but, as the thought is positively expressed in [Isa
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010.md), that the afflictions which fell
upon Israel served as a smelting furnace (kūr as in [Deu
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020).md). It was, however, a smelting of
a superior kind, a spiritual refining and testing (bâchar is Aramaic in
form, and equivalent to bâchan). The manifestation of wrath, therefore,
as these expressions affirm, had a salutary object; and in this very
object the intention was involved from the very first, that it should
only last for a time. He therefore puts an end to it now for His own
sake, i.e., not because He is induced to do so by the merits of Israel,
but purely as an act of grace, to satisfy a demand made upon Him by His
own holiness, inasmuch as, if it continued any longer, it would
encourage the heathen to blaspheme His name, and would make it appear as
though He cared nothing for His own honour, which was inseparably bound
up with the existence of Israel. The expression here is curt and harsh
throughout. In [Isa 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md), למען and
אפּי are to be supplied in thought from [Isa
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md); and in the parenthetical
exclamation, יחל איך (niphal of חלל, as in [Eze
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026).md), the distant word שׁים (my
name), also from [Isa 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md). "I will do
it" refers to the carrying out of their redemption (cf., [Isa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023).md). In [Eze
36:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#019.md) we have, as it were, a
commentary upon [Isa 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md).

[Isaiah 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 48:12</span></span>

The prophecy opened with "Hear ye;" and now the second half commences
with "Hear." Three times is the appeal made to Israel: Hear ye; Jehovah
alone is God, Creator, shaper of history, God of prophecy and of
fulfilment. "Hearken to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called! I am it, I
first, also I last. My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth,
and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: I call to them, and they
stand there together. All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear: Who among
them hath proclaimed this? He whom Jehovah loveth will accomplish his
will upon Babel, and his arm upon the Chaldeans. I, I have spoken, have
also called him, have brought him here, and his way prospers. Come ye
near to me! Hear ye this! I have not spoken in secret, from the
beginning: from the time that it takes place, there am I: and now the
Lord Jehovah hath sent me and His Spirit." Israel is to hearken to the
call of Jehovah. The obligation to this exists, on the one hand, in the
fact that it is the nation called to be the servant of Jehovah ([Isa
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#009).md), the people of sacred history;
and on the other hand, in the fact that Jehovah is הוּא (ever since [Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039.md), the fundamental clause of the
Old Testament credo), i.e., the absolute and eternally unchangeable One,
the Alpha and Omega of all history, more especially of that of Israel,
the Creator of the earth and heavens (tippach, like nâtâh elsewhere,
equivalent to the Syriac tephach, to spread out), at whose almighty call
they stand ready to obey, with all the beings they contain. אני קרא is
virtually a conditional sentence (Ewald, 357, b). So far everything has
explained the reason for the exhortation to listen to Jehovah. A further
reason is now given, by His summoning the members of His nation to
assemble together, to hear His own self-attestation, and to confirm it:
Who among them (the gods of the heathen) has proclaimed this, or
anything of the kind? That which no one but Jehovah has ever predicted
follows immediately, in the form of an independent sentence, the subject
of which is אהבו יהוה (cf., [Isa
41:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#024).md): He whom Jehovah loveth will
accomplish his will upon Babylon, and his arm (accomplish it) upon the
Chaldeans. וּזרעו is not an accusative (as Hitzig, Ewald, Stier, and
others maintain); for the expression "accomplish his arm" (? Jehovah's
or his own) is a phrase that is quite unintelligible, even if taken as
zeugmatic; it is rather the nominative of the subject, whilst כּשׂדּים =
בּכּשׂדּים, like תהלתי = תהלתי למען in [Isa
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md). Jehovah, He alone, is He who has
proclaimed such things; He also has raised up in Cyrus the predicted
conqueror of Babylon. The prosperity of his career is Jehovah's work.

As certainly now as הקּבצוּ in [Isa
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014.md) is the word of Jehovah, so
certain is it that אלי קרבוּ is the same. He summons to Himself the
members of His nation, that they may hear still further His own
testimony concerning Himself. From the beginning He has not spoken in
secret (see [Isa 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019).md); but from the
time that all which now lies before their eyes - namely, the victorious
career of Cyrus - has unfolded itself, He has been there, or has been by
(shâm, there, as in [Pro 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#027).md), to
regulate what was coming to pass, and to cause it to result in the
redemption of Israel. Hofmann gives a different explanation, viz.: "I
have not spoken in secret from the beginning; not from the time when it
came to pass (not then for the first time, but long before); I was then
(when it occurred)." But the arrangement of the words is opposed to this
continued force of the לא, and the accents are opposed to this breaking
off of the אני שׁם, which affirms that, at the time when the revolution
caused by Cyrus was preparing in the distance, He caused it to be
publicly foretold, and thereby proclaimed Himself the present Author and
Lord of what was then occurring. Up to this point Jehovah is speaking;
but who is it that now proceeds to say, "And now - namely, now that the
redemption of Israel is about to appear (ועתּה being here, as in many
other instances, e.g., [Isa 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010.md), the
turning-point of salvation) - now hath the Lord Jehovah sent me and His
Spirit?" The majority of the commentators assume that the prophet comes
forward here in his own person, behind Him whom he has introduced, and
interrupts Him. But although it is perfectly true, that in all prophecy,
from Deuteronomy onwards, words of Jehovah through the prophet and words
of the prophet of Jehovah alternate in constant, and often harsh
transitions, and that our prophet has this mark of divine inspiration in
common with all the other prophets (cf., [Isa
62:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005).md), it must also be borne in
mind, that hitherto he has not spoken once objectively of himself,
except quite indirectly (vid., [Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md); [Isa
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026).md), to say nothing of actually
coming forward in his own person. Whether this takes place further on,
more especially in [Isa 61:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md), we
will leave for the present; but here, since the prophet has not spoken
in his own person before, whereas, on the other hand, these words are
followed in [Isa 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md). by an address
concerning himself from that servant of Jehovah who announces himself as
the restorer of Israel and light of the Gentiles, and who cannot
therefore be ether Israel as a nation or the author of these prophecies,
nothing is more natural than to suppose that the words, "And now hath
the Lord," etc., form a prelude to the words of the One unequalled
servant of Jehovah concerning Himself which occur in chapter 49. The
surprisingly mysterious way in which the words of Jehovah suddenly pass
into those of His messenger, which is only comparable to [Zac
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012.md)., [Zac
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#009.md) (where the speaker is also not the
prophet, but a divine messenger exalted above him), can only be
explained in this manner. And in no other way can we explain the ועתּה,
which means that, after Jehovah has prepared the way for the redemption
of Israel by the raising up of Cyrus, in accordance with prophecy, and
by his success in arms, He has sent him, the speaker in this case, to
carry out, in a mediatorial capacity, the redemption thus prepared, and
that not by force of arms, but in the power of the Spirit of God ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); cf., [Zac
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006).md). Consequently the Spirit is not
spoken of here as joining in the sending (as Umbreit and Stier suppose,
after Jerome and the Targum: the Septuagint is indefinite, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα
αὐτοῦ); nor do we ever find the Spirit mentioned in such co-ordination
as this (see, on the other hand, [Zac
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012), per spiritum suum.md). The meaning
is, that it is also sent, i.e., sent in and with the servant of Jehovah,
who is peaking here. To convey this meaning, there was no necessity to
write either ורוּחו אתי שׁלח or ואת־רוחו שׁלחוי, since the expression is
just the same as that in [Isa 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md),
וּמצדתהּ צביה; and the Vav may be regarded as the Vav of companionship
(Mitschaft, lit., with-ship, as the Arabs call it; see at [Isa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 48:17</span></span>

The exhortation is now continued. Israel is to learn the incomparable
nature of Jehovah from the work of redemption thus prepared in word and
deed. The whole future depends upon the attitude which it henceforth
assumes to His commandments. "Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy
One of Israel; I, Jehovah thy God, am He that teacheth thee to do that
which profiteth, and leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldst go. O
that thou hearkenedst to my commandments! then thy peace becomes like
the river, and thy righteousness like waves of the sea; and thy seed
becomes like the sand, and the children of thy body like the grains
thereof: its name will not be cut off nor destroyed away from my
countenance." Jehovah is Israel's rightful and right teacher and leader.
להועיל is used in the same sense as in [Isa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#005.md) and [Isa
44:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#010.md), to furnish what is useful, to
produce what is beneficial or profitable. The optative לוּא is followed,
as in [Isa 63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019.md), by the preterite
utinam attenderis, the idea of reality being mixed up with the wish.
Instead of ויהי in the apodosis, we should expect ויהי (so would), as in
[Deu 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029.md). The former points out the
consequence of the wish regarded as already realized. Shâlōm, prosperity
or health, will thereby come upon Israel in such abundance, that it
will, as it were, bathe therein; and tsedâqâh, rectitude acceptable to
God, so abundantly, that it, the sinful one, will be covered by it over
and over again. Both of these, shâlōm and tsedâqâh, are introduced here
as a divine gift, not merited by Israel, but only conditional upon that
faith which gives heed to the word of God, especially to the word which
promises redemption, and appropriates it to itself. Another consequence
of the obedience of faith is, that Israel thereby becomes a numerous and
eternally enduring nation. The play upon the words in כמעותיו מעיך is
very conspicuous. Many expositors (e.g., Rashi, Gesenius, Hitzig, and
Knobel) regard מעות as synonymous with מעים, and therefore as signifying
the viscera, i.e., the beings that fill the heart of the sea; but it is
much more natural to suppose that the suffix points back to chōl.
Moreover, no such metaphorical use of viscera can be pointed out; and
since in other instances the feminine plural (such as kenâphōth,
qerânōth) denotes that which is artificial as distinguished from what is
natural, it is impossible to see why the interior of the sea, which is
elsewhere called lēbh (lebhabh, the heart), and indirectly also beten,
should be called מעות instead of מעים. To all appearance מעותיו
signifies the grains of sand (lxx, Jerome, Targ.); and this is confirmed
by the fact that מעא (Neo-Heb. מעה numulus) is the Targum word for גּרה,
and the Semitic root מע, related to מג; מק, melted, dissolved, signifies
to be soft or tender. The conditional character of the concluding
promise has its truth in the word מלּפני. Israel remains a nation even
in its apostasy, but fallen under the punishment of kareth (of cutting
off), under which individuals perish when they wickedly transgress the
commandment of circumcision, and others of a similar kind. It is still a
people, but rooted out and swept away from the gracious countenance of
God, who no more acknowledges it as His own people.

So far the address is hortatory. In the face of the approaching
redemption, it demands fidelity and faith. But in the certainty that
such a faithful and believing people will not be wanting within the
outer Israel, the prophecy of redemption clothes itself in the form of a
summons. "Go out of Babel, flee from Chaldaea with voice of shouting:
declare ye, preach ye this, carry it out to the end of the earth! Say
ye, Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob His servant. And they thirsted not: He
led them through dry places; He caused water to trickle out of rocks for
them; He split rocks, and waters gushed out. There is no peace, saith
Jehovah, for the wicked." They are to go out of Babylon, and with speed
and joy to leave the land of slavery and idolatry far behind. Bârach
does not mean literally to flee in this instance, but to depart with all
the rapidity of flight (compare [Exo
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#005).md). And what Jehovah has done to
them, is to be published by them over the whole earth; the redemption
experienced by Israel is to become a gospel to all mankind. The tidings
which are to be sent forth (הוצי) as in [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md), extend from גאל to the second
מים, which is repeated palindromically. Jehovah has redeemed the nation
that He chose to be the bearer of His salvation, amidst displays of
love, in which the miracles of the Egyptian redemption have been
renewed. This is what Israel has to experience, and to preach, so far as
it has remained true to its God. But there is no peace, saith Jehovah,
to the reshâ‛ı̄m: this is the name given to loose men (for the primary
meaning of the verbal root is laxity and looseness), i.e., to those
whose inward moral nature is loosened, without firm hold, and therefore
in a state of chaotic confusion, because they are without God. The
reference is to the godless in Israel. The words express the same
thought negatively which is expressed positively in [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md), "Peace upon the Israel of God."
"Shâlōm is the significant and comprehensive name given to the coming
salvation. From this the godless exclude themselves; they have no part
in the future inheritance; the sabbatical rest reserved for the people
of God does not belong to them. With this divine utterance, which
pierces the conscience like the point of an arrow, this ninth prophecy
is brought to a close; and not that only, but also the trilogy
concerning "Babel" in chapters 46-49, and the whole of the first third
of these 3 x 9 addresses to the exiles. From this time forth the name
Kōresh (Cyrus), and also the name Babel, never occur again; the relation
of the people of Jehovah to heathenism, and the redemption from Babylon,
so far as it was foretold and accomplished by Jehovah, not only proving
His sole deity, but leading to the overthrow of the idols and the
destruction of their worshippers. This theme is now exhausted, and comes
into the foreground no more. The expression איּים שׁמעוּ, in its
connection with עמּי נחמוּ, points at once to the diversity in character
of the second section, which commences here.
