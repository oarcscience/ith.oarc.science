### [Psalms Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 37:0</span></span>

The Seeming Prosperity of the Wicked, and the Real Prosperity of the
Godly

The bond of connection between [Psa
36:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md) and 37 is their similarity of
contents, which here and there extends even to accords of expression.
The fundamental thought running through the whole Psalm is at once
expressed in the opening verses: Do not let the prosperity of the
ungodly be a source of vexation to thee, but wait on the Lord; for the
prosperity of the ungodly will suddenly come to an end, and the issue
determines between the righteous and the unrighteous. Hence Tertullian
calls this Psalm providentiae speculum; Isodore, potio contra murmur;
and Luther, vestis piorum, cui adscriptum: Hic Sanctorum patientia est
([Rev 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#012).md). This fundamental thought
the poet does not expand in strophes of ordinary compass, but in shorter
utterances of the proverbial form following the order of the letters of
the alphabet, and not without some repetitions and recurrences to a
previous thought, in order to impress it still more convincingly and
deeply upon the mind. The Psalm belongs therefore to the series Ps 9 and
[Psa 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md), [Psa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md), [Psa
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md), - all alphabetical Psalms of
David, of whose language, cheering, high-flown, thoughtful, and at the
same time so easy and unartificial, and withal elegant, this Psalm is
fully worthy. The structure of the proverbial utterances is almost
entirely tetrastichic; though ד, כ, and ק are tristichs, and ח (which is
twice represented, though perhaps unintentionally), נ, and ת are
pentastichs. The ע is apparently wanting; but, on closer inspection, the
originally separated strophes ס and ע are only run into one another by
the division of the verses. The ע strophe begins with לעולם, [Psa
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028.md), and forms a tetrastich, just
like the ס. The fact that the preposition ל stands before the letter
next in order need not confuse one. The ת, [Psa
37:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039.md), also begins with ותשׁועת. The
homogeneous beginnings, זמם רשׁע, לוה רשׁע, צופה רשׁע, [Psa
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012.md), [Psa
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#021.md), [Psa
37:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#032.md), seem, as Hitzig remarks, to be
designed to give prominence to the pauses in the succession of the
proverbial utterances.

[Psalms 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 37:1</span></span>

Olshausen observes, "The poet keeps entirely to the standpoint of the
old Hebrew doctrine of recompense, which the Book of Job so powerfully
refutes." But, viewed in the light of the final issue, all God's
government is really in a word righteous recompense; and the Old
Testament theodicy is only inadequate in so far as the future, which
adjusts all present inconsistencies, is still veiled. Meanwhile the
punitive justice of God does make itself manifest, as a rule, in the
case of the ungodly even in the present world; even their dying is
usually a fearful end to their life's prosperity. This it is which the
poet means here, and which is also expressed by Job himself in the Book
of Job, [Job 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001.md). With התחרה, to grow
hot or angry (distinct from תּחרה, to emulate, [Jer
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005.md); [Jer
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015).md), alternates קנּא, to get into a
glow, excandescentia, whether it be the restrained heat of sullen envy,
or the incontrollable heat of impetuous zeal which would gladly call
down fire from heaven. This first distich has been transferred to the
Book of Proverbs, [Pro 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#019.md), cf. [Pro
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#017.md); [Pro
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#001.md); [Pro
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031.md); and in general we may remark
that this Psalm is one of the Davidic patterns for the Salomonic gnome
system. The form ימּלוּ is, according to Gesenius, Olshausen, and
Hitzig, fut. Kal of מלל, cognate אמל, they wither away, pausal form for
ימּלוּ like יתּממוּ, [Psa 102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md); but
the signification to cut off also is secured to the verb מלל by the
Niph. נמל, [Gen 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#011.md), whence fut.
ימּלוּ = ימּלּוּ; vid., on [Job 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002.md);
[Job 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016.md). ירק דּשׁא is a genitival
combination: the green (viror) of young vigorous vegetation.

[Psalms 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 37:3</span></span>

The "land" is throughout this Psalm the promised possession (Heilsgut),
viz., the land of Jahve's presence, which has not merely a glorious
past, but also a future rich in promises; and will finally, ore
perfectly than under Joshua, become the inheritance of the true Israel.
It is therefore to be explained: enjoy the quiet sure habitation which
God gives thee, and diligently cultivate the virtue of faithfulness. The
two imperatives in [Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003.md), since
there are two of them (cf. [Psa 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027).md)
and the first is without any conjunctive Waw, have the appearance of
being continued admonitions, not promises; and consequently אמוּנה is
not an adverbial accusative as in [Psa
119:75](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#075) (Ewald.md), but the object to רעה,
to pasture, to pursue, to practise (Syriac רדף, [Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002).md); cf. רעה, רע, one who interests
himself in any one, or anything; Beduin râ‛â = ṣâḥb, of every kind of
closer relationship (Deutsch. Morgenlnd. Zeitschr. v. 9). In [Psa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004.md), ויתן is an apodosis: delight in
Jahve (cf. [Job 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#026.md); [Psa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md); [Isa
58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014).md), so will He grant thee the
desire (משׁאלת, as in [Psa 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#005).md) of
thy heart; for he who, entirely severed from the creature, finds his
highest delight in God, cannot desire anything that is at enmity with
God, but he also can desire nothing that God, with whose will his own is
thoroughly blended in love, would refuse him.

[Psalms 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 37:5</span></span>

The lxx erroneously renders גּול (= גּל, [Psa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009).md) by ἀποκάλυψον instead of
ἐπίῤῥιψον, [Pe1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md) : roll the burden
of cares of thy life's way upon Jahve, leave the guidance of thy life
entirely to Him, and to Him alone, without doing anything in it thyself:
He will gloriously accomplish (all that concerns thee): עשׂה, as in Ps
22:32; 52:11; cf. [Pro 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#003.md), and Paul
Gerhardt's Befiehl du deine Wege, "Commit thou all thy ways," etc. The
perfect in [Psa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006.md) is a continuation
of the promissory יעשׂה. הוציא, as in [Jer
51:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#010.md), signifies to set forth: He will
bring to light thy misjudged righteousness like the light (the sun, [Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md); [Job
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md), and more especially the morning
sun, [Pro 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018).md), which breaks through
the darkness; and thy down-trodden right (משׁפּטך is the pausal form of
the singular beside Mugrash) like the bright light of the noon-day: cf.
[Isa 58:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#010.md), as on [Psa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004.md), [Isa
58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014.md).

[Psalms 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 37:7</span></span>

The verb דּמם, with its derivatives ([Psa
62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md), [Psa
62:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#006.md); [Lam
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#028).md), denotes resignation, i.e., a
quiet of mind which rests on God, renounces all self-help, and submits
to the will of God. התחולל (from הוּל, to be in a state of tension, to
wait) of the inward gathering of one's self together in hope intently
directed towards God, as in B. Berachoth 30b is a synonym of התחונן, and
as it were reflexive of חלּה of the collecting one's self to importunate
prayer. With [Psa 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007.md) the primary
tone of the whole Psalm is struck anew. On [Psa
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007.md) compare the definition of the
mischief-maker in [Pro 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 37:8</span></span>

On הרף (let alone), imper. apoc. Hiph., instead of הרפּה, vid., Ges.
֗75, rem. 15. אך להרע is a clause to itself (cf. [Pro
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024.md); [Psa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005.md); [Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016).md): it tends only to evil-doing,
it ends only in thy involving thyself in sin. The final issue, without
any need that thou shouldst turn sullen, is that the מרעים, like to whom
thou dost make thyself by such passionate murmuring and displeasure,
will be cut off, and they who, turning from the troublous present, make
Jahve the ground and aim of their hope, shall inherit the land (vid.,
[Psa 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013).md). It is the end, the final
and consequently eternal end, that decides the matter.

[Psalms 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 37:10</span></span>

The protasis in [Psa 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010.md) is
literally: adhuc parum (temporis superest), עוד מעט ו, as e.g., [Exo
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#030.md), and as in a similar connection
מעט ו, [Job 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#024.md). והתבּוננתּ also is
a protasis with a hypothetical perfect, Ges. ֗155, 4, a. This promise
also runs in the mouth of the Preacher on the Mount ([Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005).md) just as the lxx renders [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011.md): οἱ δὲ πρᾳεῖς κληρονομήσουσι
γῆν. Meekness, which is content with God, and renounces all earthly
stays, will at length become the inheritor of the land, yea of the
earth. Whatever God-opposed self-love may amass to itself and may seek
to acquire, falls into the hands of the meek as their blessed
possession.

[Psalms 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 37:12</span></span>

The verb זמם is construed with ל of that which is the object at which
the evil devices aim. To gnash the teeth (elsewhere also: with the
teeth) is, as in [Psa 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016.md), cf. [Job
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009.md), a gesture of anger, not of
mockery, although anger and mockery are usually found together. But the
Lord, who regards an assault upon the righteous as an assault upon
Himself, laughs ([Psa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004).md) at the
enraged schemer; for He, who orders the destinies of men, sees
beforehand, with His omniscient insight into the future, his day, i.e.,
the day of his death ([Sa1 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#010).md), of
his visitation ([Psa 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md), [Oba
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012.md), [Jer
50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027.md), [Jer
50:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#031).md).

[Psalms 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 37:14</span></span>

That which corresponds to the "treading" or stringing of the bow is the
drawing from the sheath or unsheathing of the sword: פּתח, [Eze
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028.md), cf. [Psa
55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022.md). The combination ישׁרי־דּרך is
just like תמימי־דוך, [Psa 119:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#001.md). The
emphasis in [Psa 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#014.md) is upon the
suffix of בלבּם: they shall perish by their own weapon. קשּׁתותם has (in
Baer) a Shebג dirimens, as also in [Isa
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028.md) in correct texts.

[Psalms 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 37:16</span></span>

With [Psa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016.md) accord [Pro
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016.md); [Pro
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#008.md), cf. Tobit 12:8. The ל of לצּדּיק
is a periphrastic indication of the genitive (Ges. 115). המון is a noisy
multitude, here used of earthly possessions. רבּים is not per attract.
(cf. [Psa 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011), הם for הוּא.md)
equivalent to רב, but the one righteous man is contrasted with many
unrighteous. The arms are here named instead of the bow in [Psa
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#015.md). He whose arms are broken can
neither injure others nor help himself. Whereas Jahve does for the
righteous what earthly wealth and human power cannot do: He Himself
upholds them.

[Psalms 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 37:18</span></span>

The life of those who love Jahve with the whole heart is, with all its
vicissitudes, an object of His loving regard and of His observant
providential care, [Psa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md); [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md), cf. [Psa
16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md). He neither suffers His own to
lose their heritage nor to be themselves lost to it. The αἰώνιος
κληρονομία is not as yet thought of as extending into the future world,
as in the New Testament. In [Psa 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#019.md)
the surviving refers only to this present life.

[Psalms 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 37:20</span></span>

With כּי the preceding assertion is confirmed by its opposite (cf. [Psa
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004).md). כּיקר בּרים forms a fine play
in sound; יקר is a substantivized adjective like גּדל ekil evitcejda,
[Exo 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016.md). Instead of בעשׁן, it is
not to be read כּעשׁן, [Hos 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003.md); the
ב is secured by [Psa 102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md); [Psa
78:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#033.md). The idea is, that they vanish
into smoke, i.e., are resolved into it, or also, that they vanish in the
manner of smoke, which is first thick, but then becomes thinner and
thinner till it disappears (Rosenm׬ller, Hupfeld, Hitzig); both
expressions are admissible as to fact and as to the language, and the
latter is commended by בּהבל, [Psa
78:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#033.md), cf. בּצלם, [Psa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md). בעשׁן belongs to the first,
regularly accented כּלוּ; for the Munach by בעשׂן is the substitute for
Mugrash, which never can be used where at least two syllables do not
precede the Silluk tone (vid., Psalter ii. 503). The second כּלוּ has
the accent on the penult. for a change (Ew. 194, c), i.e., variation of
the rhythm (cf. למה למה, [Psa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md);
[Psa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002.md); עורי עורי, [Jdg
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#012.md), and on [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007).md), and in particular here on
account of its pausal position (cf. ערוּ, [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 37:21</span></span>

It is the promise expressed in [Deu
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#006.md); [Deu
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#012.md), [Deu
28:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#044.md), which is rendered in [Psa
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#021.md) in the more universal,
sententious form. לוה signifies to be bound or under obligation to any
one = to borrow and to owe (nexum esse). The confirmation of [Psa
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#022.md) is not inappropriate (as Hitzig
considers it, who places [Psa 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#022.md)
after [Psa 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020).md): in that ever deeper
downfall of the ungodly, and in that charitableness of the righteous,
which becomes more and more easy to him by reason of his prosperity, the
curse and blessing of God, which shall be revealed in the end of the
earthly lot of both the righteous and the ungodly, are even now
foretold. Whilst those who reject the blessing of God are cut off, the
promise given to the patriarchs is fulfilled in the experience of those
who are blessed of God, in all its fulness.

[Psalms 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 37:23</span></span>

By Jahve (מן, ἀπό, almost equivalent to ὑπό with the passive, as in [Job
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001.md); [Ecc
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011), and in a few other passages.md)
are a man's steps made firm, established; not: ordered or directed (lxx,
Jerome, κατευθύνεται), which, according to the extant usage of the
language, would be הוּכנוּ (passive of הכין, [Pro
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009.md); [Jer
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023.md); [Ch2
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#006).md), whereas כּוננוּ, the Pulal of
כּונן, is to be understood according to [Psa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md). By גּבר is meant man in an
emphatic sense ([Job 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003).md), and in
fact in an ethical sense; compare, on the other hand, the expression of
the more general saying, "Man proposes, and God disposes," [Pro
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009.md); [Pro
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#024.md); [Jer
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023.md). [Psa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023.md) shows that it is the upright man
that is meant in [Psa 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023.md): to the
way, i.e., course of life, of such an one God turns with pleasure (יחפּץ
pausal change of vowel for יחפּץ): supposing he should fall, whether it
be a fall arising from misfortune or from error, or both together, he is
not prostrated, but Jahve upholds his hand, affords it a firm point of
support or fulcrum (cf. תּמך בּ, [Psa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#009), and frequently.md), so that he can
raise himself again, rise up again.

[Psalms 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 37:25</span></span>

There is an old theological rule: promissiones corporales intelligendae
sunt cum exceptione crucis et castigationis. Temporary forsakenness and
destitution the Psalm does not deny: it is indeed even intended to meet
the conflict of doubt which springs up in the minds of the God-fearing
out of certain conditions and circumstances that are seemingly
contradictory to the justice of God; and this it does, by contrasting
that which in the end abides with that which is transitory, and in fact
without the knowledge of any final decisive adjustment in a future
world; and it only solves its problem, in so far as it is placed in the
light of the New Testament, which already dawns in the Book of
Ecclesiastes.

[Psalms 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 37:27</span></span>

[Psa 37:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027.md)

The round of the exhortations and promises is here again reached as in
[Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003.md). The imperative שׁכן, which
is there hortatory, is found here with the ו of sequence in the sense of
a promise: and continue, doing such things, to dwell for ever = so shalt
thou, etc. (שׁכן, pregnant as in Ps 102:29, [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015).md). Nevertheless the imperative
retains its meaning even in such instances, inasmuch as the exhortation
is given to share in the reward of duty at the same time with the
discharge of it. On [Psa 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028.md) compare
[Psa 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#005.md).

[Psa 37:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028.md)

The division of the verse is wrong; for the ס strophe, without any
doubt, closes with חסדיו, and the ע eht dna strophe begins with לעולם,
so that, according to the text which we possess, the ע of this word is
the acrostic letter. The lxx, however, after εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα φυλαχθήσονται
has another line, which suggests another commencement for the ע strophe,
and runs in Cod. Vat., incorrectly, ἄμωμοι ἐκδικήσονται, in Cod. Alex.,
correctly, ἄνομοι δὲ ἐκδιωχθήσονται (Symmachus, ἄνομοι ἐξαρθήσονται). By
ἄνομος the lxx translates עריץ in [Isa
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md); by ἄνομα, עולה in [Job
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#004.md); and by ἐκδιώκειν, הצמית, the
synonym of השׁמיד, in [Psa 101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005.md); so
that consequently this line, as even Venema and Schleusner have
discerned, was עוּלים נשׁמדוּ. It will at once be seen that this is only
another reading for לעולם נשׁמרו; and, since it stands side by side with
the latter, that it is an ancient attempt to produce a correct beginning
for the ע strophe, which has been transplanted from the lxx into the
text. It is, however, questionable whether this reparation is really a
restoration of the original words (Hupfeld, Hitzig); since עוּל (עויל)
is not a word found in the Psalms (for which reason Bצttcher's
conjecture of עשׁי עולה more readily commends itself, although it is
critically less probable), and לעולם נשׁמרו forms a continuation that is
more naturally brought about by the context and perfectly logical.

[Psalms 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 37:30</span></span>

The verb הגה unites in itself the two meanings of meditating and of
meditative utterance (vid., [Psa 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001).md),
just as אמר those of thinking and speaking. [Psa
37:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#031.md) in this connection affirms the
stability of the moral nature. The walk of the righteous has a fixed
inward rule, for the Tפra is to him not merely an external object of
knowledge and a compulsory precept; it is in his heart, and, because it
is the Tפra of his God whom he loves, as the motive of his actions
closely united with his own will. On תּמעד, followed by the subject in
the plural, compare [Psa 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035.md); [Psa
73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002.md) Chethמb.

[Psalms 37:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 37:32</span></span>

The Lord as ἀνακρίνων is, as in [Co1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003.md)., put in contrast with the
ἀνακρίνειν of men, or of human ἡμέρᾳ. If men sit in judgment upon the
righteous, yet God, the supreme Judge, does not condemn him, but acquits
him (cf. on the contrary [Psa 109:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#007).md).
Si condemnamur a mundo, exclaimed Tertullian to his companions in
persecution, absolvimur a Deo.

[Psalms 37:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 37:34</span></span>

Let the eye of faith directed hopefully to Jahve go on its way, without
suffering thyself to be turned aside by the persecution and condemnation
of the world, then He will at length raise thee out of all trouble, and
cause thee to possess (לרשׁת, ut possidas et possideas) the land, as the
sole lords of which the evil-doers, now cut off, conducted themselves.

[Psalms 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 37:35</span></span>

עריץ (after the form צדּיק) is coupled with רשׁע, must as these two
words alternate in [Job 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020.md) : a
terror-inspiring, tyrannical evil-doer; cf. besides also [Job
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#003.md). The participle in [Psa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md) forms a clause by itself: et se
diffundens, scil. erat. The lxx and Jerome translate as though it were
כארז הלבנן, "like the cedars of Lebanon," instead of כאזרח רענן. But
אזרח רענן is the expression for an oak, terebinth, or the like, that has
brown from time immemorial in its native soil, and has in the course of
centuries attained a gigantic size in the stem, and a wide-spreading
overhanging head. ויּעבר does not mean: then he vanished away (Hupfeld
and others); for עבר in this sense is not suitable to a tree. Luther
correctly renders it: man ging vor׬ber, one (they) passed by, Ges. ֗137,
3. The lxx, Syriac, and others, by way of lightening the difficulty,
render it: then I passed by.

[Psalms 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 37:37</span></span>

תּם might even be taken as neuter for תּם, and ישׂר for ישׁר; but in
this case the poet would have written רעה instead of ראה; שׁמר is
therefore used as, e.g., in [Sa1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#012.md).
By כּי that to which attention is specially called is introduced. The
man of peace has a totally different lot from the evil-doer who delights
in contention and persecution. As the fruit of his love of peace he has
אחרית, a future, [Pro 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#018.md); [Pro
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#014.md), viz., in his posterity, [Pro
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#020.md); whereas the apostates are
altogether blotted out; not merely they themselves, but even the
posterity of the ungodly is cut off, [Amo
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002.md); [Amo
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md); [Eze
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#025.md). To them remains no posterity to
carry forward their name, their אחרית is devoted to destruction (cf.
[Psa 109:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#013.md) with [Num
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020).md).

[Psalms 37:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 37:39</span></span>

The salvation of the righteous cometh from Jahve; it is therefore
characterized, in accordance with its origin, as sure, perfect, and
enduring for ever. מעוּזּם is an apposition; the plena scriptio serves,
as in [Sa2 22:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#033.md), to indicate to us
that מעוז is meant in this passage to signify not a fortress, but a
hiding-place, a place of protection, a refuge, in which sense Arab.
ma'âd‛llh (the protection of God) and m‛âḏwjh‛llh (the protection of
God's presence) is an Arabic expression (also used as a formula of an
oath); vid., moreover on [Psa 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#003.md).
The moods of sequence in [Psa 37:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#040.md)
are aoristi gnomici. The parallelism in [Psa
37:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#040.md) is progressive after the manner
of the Psalms of degrees. The short confirmatory clause kichā'subo forms
an expressive closing cadence.
