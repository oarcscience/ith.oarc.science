<p>But it is love to His own people which impels the God of Israel to suspend such a judgment of eternal destruction over Babylon. "For Jehovah will have mercy on Jacob, and will once more choose Israel, and will settle them in their own land: and the foreigner will associate with them, and they will cleave to the house of Jacob. And nations take them, and accompany them to their place; and the house of Israel takes them to itself in the land of Jehovah for servants and maid-servants: and they hold in captivity those who led them away captive; and become lords over their oppressors." We have here in nuce the comforting substance of chapters 46-66. Babylon falls that Israel may rise. This is effected by the compassion of God. He chooses Israel once more (iterum, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007">Job 14:7</A> for example), and therefore makes a new covenant with it. Then follows their return to Canaan, their own land, Jehovah's land (as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003">Hos 9:3</A>). Proselytes from among the heathen, who have acknowledged the God of the exiles, go along with them, as Ruth did with Naomi. Heathen accompany the exiles to their own place. And now their relative positions are reversed. Those who accompany Israel are now taken possession of by the latter (hithnache&#772;l, &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;, like hithpatte&#772;ach, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002">Isa 52:2</A>, &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; cf., p. 62, note, and Ewald, 124, b), as servants and maid-servants; and they (the Israelites) become leaders into captivity of those who led them into captivity (Lamed with the participle, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009">Isa 11:9</A>), and they will oppress (ra&#770;da&#770;h b', as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015">Psa 49:15</A>) their oppressors. This retribution of life for like is to all appearance quite out of harmony with the New Testament love. But in reality it is no retribution of like for like. For, according to the prophet's meaning, to be ruled by the people of God is the true happiness of the nations, and to allow themselves to be so ruled is their true liberty. At the same time, the form in which the promise is expressed is certainly not that of the New Testament; and it would not possibly have been so, for the simple reason that in Old Testament times, and from an Old Testament point of view, there was no other visible manifestation of the church (ecclesia) than in the form of a nation. This national form of the church has been broken up under the New Testament, and will never be restored. Israel, indeed, will be restored as a nation; but the true essence of the church, which is raised above all national distinctions, will never return to those worldly limits which it has broken through. And the fact that the prophecy moves within those limits here may be easily explained, on the ground that it is primarily the deliverance from the Babylonian captivity to which the promise refers. And the prophet himself was unconscious that this captivity would be followed by another. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#003">Isaiah 14:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 14:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The song of the redeemed is a song concerning the fall of the king of Babel. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#003">Isa 14:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004">Isa 14:4</A>. Instead of the hiphil hinniach (to let down) of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001">Isa 14:1</A>, we have here, as in the original passage, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019">Deu 25:19</A>, the form he&#772;niach, which is commonly used in the sense of quieting, or procuring rest. &#1506;&#1510;&#1489; is trouble which plagues (as &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; is trouble which oppresses), and ro&#772;gez restlessness which wears out with anxious care (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#026">Job 3:26</A>, cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#018">Eze 12:18</A>). The assimilated min before the two words is pronounced mi&#774;, with a weak reduplication, instead of me&#772;, as elsewhere, before &#1495;, &#1492;, and even before &#1512;    (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#028">Sa1 23:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#016">Sa2 18:16</A>). In the relative clause &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512;, &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; is not the Hebrew casus adverb. answering to the Latin ablative qu servo te usi sunt; not do &#1489;&#1498; ... &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; belong to one another in the sense of quo, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#003">Deu 21:3</A>, qu (vitul); but it is regarded as an acc. obj. according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#014">Exo 1:14</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039">Lev 25:39</A>, qu'on t'a fait servir, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#005">Num 32:5</A>, qu'on donne la terre (Luzzatto). When delivered from such a yoke of bondage, Israel would raise a ma&#770;sha&#770;l. According to its primary and general meaning, ma&#770;sha&#770;l signifies figurative language, and hence poetry generally, more especially that kind of proverbial poetry which loves the emblematical, and, in fact, any artistic composition that is piquant in its character; so that the idea of what is satirical or defiant may easily be associated with it, as in the passage before us.
<p>The words are addressed to the Israel of the future in the Israel of the present, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001">Isa 12:1</A>. The former would then sing, and say as follows. "How hath the oppressor ceased! The place of torture ceased! Jehovah hath broken the rod of the wicked, the ruler's staff, which cmote nations in wrath with strokes without ceasing subjugated nations wrathfully with hunting than nevers stays." Not one of the early translators ever thought of deriving the hap. leg. madheba&#770;h from the Aramaean dehab (gold), as Vitringa, Aurivillius, and Rosenmller have done. The former have all translated the word as if it were marhe&#772;ba&#770;h (haughty, violent treatment), as corrected by J. D. Michaelis, Doederlein, Knobel, and others. But we may arrive at the same result without altering a single letter, if we take &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; as equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;, &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, to melt or pine away, whether we go back to the kal or to the hiphil of the verb, and regard the Mem as used in a material or local sense. We understand it, according to madmenah (dunghill) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010">Isa 25:10</A>, as denoting the place where they were reduced to pining away, i.e., as applied to Babylon as the house of servitude where Israel had been wearied to death. The tyrant's sceptre, mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005">Isa 14:5</A>, is the Chaldean world-power regarded as concentrated in the king of Babel (cf., she&#772;bet in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017">Num 24:17</A>). This tyrant's sceptre smote nations with incessant blows and hunting: maccath is construed with macceh, the derivative of the same verb; and murda&#770;ph, a hophal noun (as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001">Isa 9:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003">Isa 29:3</A>), with rodeh, which is kindred in meaning. Doederlein's conjecture (mirdath), which has been adopted by most modern commentators, is quite unnecessary. Unceasing continuance is expressed first of all with bilti, which is used as a preposition, and followed by sa&#770;ra&#770;h, a participial noun like ca&#770;la&#770;h, and then with b'li, which is construed with the finite verb as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#020">Gen 31:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#018">Job 41:18</A>; for b'li cha&#770;sa&#770;k is an attributive clause: with a hunting which did not restrain itself, did not stop, and therefore did not spare. Nor is it only Israel and other subjugated nations that now breathe again. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007">Isaiah 14:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 14:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>"The whole earth rests, is quiet: they break forth into singing. Even the cypresses rejoice at thee, the cedars of Lebanon: 'Since thou hast gone to sleep, no one will come up to lay the axe upon us.'" The preterites indicate inchoatively the circumstances into which the whole earth has now entered. The omission of the subject in the case of pa&#770;tz'chu (they break forth) gives the greatest generality to the jubilant utterances: pa&#770;tzach rinna&#770;h (erumpere gaudio) is an expression that is characteristic of Isaiah alone (e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023">Isa 44:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013">Isa 49:13</A>); and it is a distinctive peculiarity of the prophet to bring in the trees of the forest, as living and speaking beings, to share in the universal joy (cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012">Isa 55:12</A>). Jerome supposes the trees to be figuratively employed here for the "chiefs of the nations" (principes gentium). But this disposition to allegorize not only destroys the reality of the contents, but the spirit of the poetry also. Cypresses and cedars rejoice because of the treatment which they received from the Chaldean, who made use of the almost imperishable wood of both of them for ornamental buildings, for his siege apparatus, and for his fleets, and even for ordinary ships - as Alexander, for example, built himself a fleet of cypress-wood, and the Syrian vessels had masts of cedar. Of the old cedars of Lebanon, there are hardly thirty left in the principle spot where they formerly grew. Gardner Wilkinson (1843) and Hooker the botanist (1860) estimated the whole number at about four hundred; and according to the conclusion which the latter drew from the number of concentric rings and other signs, not one of them is more than about five hundred years old.
<p>(Note: See Wilkinson's paper in the Athenaeum (London, Noverse 1862).) 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009">Isaiah 14:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 14:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>But whilst it has become so quiet on earth, there is the most violent agitation in the regions below. "The kingdom of the dead below is all in uproar on account of thee, to meet thy coming; it stirreth up the shades for thee, all the he-goats of the earth; it raiseth up from their throne-seats all the kings of the nations." The notion of Hades, notwithstanding the mythological character which it had assumed, was based upon the double truth, that what a man has been, and the manner in which he has lived on this side the grave, are not obliterated on the other side, but are then really brought to light, and that there is an immaterial self-formation of the soul, in which all that a man has become under certain divinely appointed circumstances, by his own self-determination, is, as it were, reflected in a mirror, and that in a permanent form. This psychical image, to which the dead body bears the same relation as the shattered mould to a cast, is the shade-like corporeality of the inhabitants of Hades, in which they appear essentially though spiritually just as they were on this side the grave. This is the deep root of what the prophet has here expressed in a poetical form; for it is really a ma&#770;sha&#770;l that he has interwoven with his prophecy here. All Hades is overwhelmed with excitement and wonder, now that the king of Babel, that invincible ruler of the world, who, if not unexpected altogether, was not expected so soon, as actually approaching. From &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; onwards, Sheol, although a feminine, might be the subject; in which case the verb would simply have reverted from the feminine to the radical masculine form. But it is better to regard the subject as neuter; a nescio quid, a nameless power. The shades are suddenly seized with astonishment, more especially the former leaders (leading goats or bell-wethers) of the herds of nations, so that, from sheer amazement, they spring up from their seats. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#010">Isaiah 14:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 14:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>And how do they greet this lofty new-comer? "They all rise up and say to thee, Art thou also made weak like us? art thou become like us?" This is all that the shades say; what follows does not belong to them. The pual chulla&#770;h (only used here), "to be made sickly, or powerless," signifies to be transposed into the condition of the latter, viz., the Repahim (a word which also occurs in the Phoenician inscriptions, from &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; = &#1512;&#1508;&#1492;, to be relaxed or weary), since the life of the shades is only a shadow of life (cf., &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, and possibly also &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; in Homer, when used in the sense of those who are dying, exhausted and prostrate with weakness). And in Hades we could not expect anything more than this expression of extreme amazement. For why should they receive their new comrade with contempt or scorn? From <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011">Isa 14:11</A> onwards, the singers of the mashal take up the song again. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011">Isaiah 14:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 14:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>"Thy pomp is cast down to the region of the dead, the noise of thy harps: maggots are spread under thee, and they that cover thee are worms." From the book of Daniel we learn the character of the Babylonian music; it abounded in instruments, some of which were foreign. Maggots and worms (a bitter sarcasm) now take the place of the costly artistic Babylonian rugs, which once formed the pillow and counterpane of the distinguished corpse. &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1506; might be a third pers. hophal (Ges. 71); but here, between perfects, it is a third pers. pual, like yullad in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005">Isa 9:5</A>. Rimma&#770;h, which is preceded by the verb in a masculine and to a certain extent an indifferent form (Ges. 147, a), is a collective name for small worms, in any mass of which the individual is lost in the swarm. The passage is continued with &#1488;&#1497;&#1498; (on which, as a catchword of the mashal, see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021">Isa 1:21</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012">Isaiah 14:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">isa 14:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>"How art thou fallen from the sky, thou star of light, sun of the dawn, hurled down to the earth, thou that didst throw down nations from above?" &#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500; is here the morning star (from ha&#770;lal, to shine, resolved from hillel, after the form &#1502;&#1488;&#1503;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#010">Jer 13:10</A>, &#1505;&#1506;&#1507;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#113">Psa 119:113</A>, or rather attaching itself as a third class to the forms &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501;: compare the Arabic sairaf, exchanger; saikal, sword-cleaner). It derives its name in other ancient languages also from its striking brilliancy, and is here called ben-shachar (sun of the dawn), just as in the classical mythology it is called son of Eos, from the fact that it rises before the sun, and swims in the morning light as if that were the source of its birth.
<p>(Note: It is singular, however, that among the Semitic nations the morning star is not personified as a male (Heo&#772;sphoros or Pho&#772;sphoros), but as a female (Astarte, see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#008">Isa 17:8</A>), and that it is called Na&#770;gha&#770;h, Ashtoreth, Zuhara, but never by a name derived from ha&#770;lal; whilst the moon is regarded as a male deity (Sin), and in Arabic hila&#770;l signifies the new moon, which might be called ben- shacar (son of the dawn), from the fact that, from the time when it passes out of the invisibility of its first phase, it is seen at sunrise, and is as it were born out of the dawn.)
<p>Lucifer, as a name given to the devil, was derived from this passage, which the fathers (and lately Stier) interpreted, without any warrant whatever, as relating to the apostasy and punishment of the angelic leaders. The appellation is a perfectly appropriate one for the king of Babel, on account of the early date of the Babylonian culture, which reached back as far as the grey twilight of primeval times, and also because of its predominant astrological character. The additional epithet cho&#772;le&#772;sh &#8219;al-go&#772;yim is founded upon the idea of the influxus siderum:
<p>(Note: In a similar manner, the sun-god (San) is called the "conqueror of the king's enemies," "breaker of opposition," etc., on the early Babylonian monuments (see G. Rawlinson, The Five Great Monarchies, i. 160).)
<p>cholesh signifies "overthrowing" or laying down (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#013">Exo 17:13</A>), and with &#8219;al, "bringing defeat upon;" whilst the Talmud (b. Sabbath 149b) uses it in the sense of projiciens sortem, and thus throws light upon the cholesh (= purah, lot) of the Mishnah. A retrospective glance is now cast at the self-deification of the king of Babylon, in which he was the antitype of the devil and the type of antichrist (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036">Dan 11:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004">Th2 2:4</A>), and which had met with its reward. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013">Isaiah 14:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">isa 14:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>"And thou, thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, and sit down on the mount of the assembly of gods in the corner of the north. I will ascend to the heights of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High. Nevertheless, thou wilt be cast down into the region of the dead, into the corner of the pit." An antithetical circumstantial clause commences with veattah, just as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019">Isa 14:19</A>, "whilst thou," or "whereas thou." The har hammo&#772;e&#772;d (mount of assembly) cannot be Zion, as is assumed by Schegg and others, who are led astray by the parallel in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003">Psa 48:3</A>, which has been entirely misunderstood, and has no bearing upon this passage at all. Zion was neither a northern point of the earth, nor was it situated on the north of Jerusalem. The prophet makes the king of Babylon speak according to the general notion of his people, who had not the seat of the Deity in the midst of them, as the Israelites had, but who placed it on the summit of the northern mountains, which were lost in the clouds, just as the Hindus place it on the fabulous mountains of Kaila&#770;sa, which lie towards the north beyond the Himalayas (Lassen, i. 34ff.). &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; (with an aspirated &#1499; in a loosely closed syllable) are the two sides into which a thing parts, the two legs of an angle, and then the apex at which the legs separate. And so here, &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; (with an unaspirated Caph in a triply closed syllable) is the uttermost extremity of the north, from which the northern mountains stretch fork-like into the land, and yarcethe-bor the interior of the pit into which its two walls slope, and from which it unfolds or widens. All the foolhardy purposes of the Chaldean are finally comprehended in this, "I will make myself like the Most High;" just as the Assyrians, according to Ctesias, and the Persians, according to the Persae of Aeschylus, really called their king God, and the Sassanidae call themselves bag, Theos, upon coins and inscriptions ('eddammeh is hithpael, equivalent to 'ethdammeh, which the usual assimilation of the preformative Tav: Ges. 34, 2, b). By the &#1488;&#1498; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#014">Psa 48:14</A>, the high-flying pride of the Chaldean is contrasted with his punishment, which hurls him down into the lowest depths. &#1488;&#1498;, which was originally affirmative, and then restrictive (as rak was originally restrictive and then affirmative), passes over here into an adversative, just as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016">Psa 49:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015">Job 13:15</A> (a change seen still more frequently in &#1488;&#1499;&#1503;); nevertheless thou wilt be hurled down; nothing but that will occur, and not what you propose. The prophetic tu&#772;rad is language that neither befits the inhabitants of Hades, who greet his advent, nor the Israel singing the mashal; but the words of Israel have imperceptibly passed into words of the prophet, who still sees in the distance, and as something future, what the mashal commemorates as already past. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#016">Isaiah 14:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">isa 14:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The prophet then continues in the language of prediction. "They that see thee look, considering thee, look at thee thoughtfully: Is this the man that set the earth trembling, and kingdoms shaking? that made the world a wilderness, and destroyed its cities, and did not release its prisoners (to their) home?" The scene is no longer in Hades (Knobel, Umbreit). Those who are speaking thus have no longer the Chaldean before them as a mere shade, but as an unburied corpse that has fallen into corruption. As te&#772;be&#772;l is feminine, the suffixes in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#017">Isa 14:17</A> must refer, according to a constructio ad sensum, to the world as changed into a wilderness (midba&#770;r). Pa&#770;thach, to open, namely locks and fetters; here, with baitha&#770;h, it is equivalent to releasing or letting go (syn. shille&#772;ach, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#033">Jer 50:33</A>). By the "prisoners" the Jewish exiles are principally intended; and it was their release that had never entered the mind of the king of Babylon. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#018">Isaiah 14:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">isa 14:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The prophet, whose own words now follow the words of the spectators, proceeds to describe the state in which the tyrant lies, and which calls for such serious reflections. "All the kings of the nations, they are all interred in honour, every one in his house: but thou art cast away far from thy sepulchre like a shoot hurled away, clothed with slain, with those pierced through with the sword, those that go down to the stones of the pit; like a carcase trodden under feet." Every other king was laid out after his death "in his house" (b'be&#772;tho&#772;), i.e. within the limits of his own palace; but the Chaldean lay far away from the sepulchre that was apparently intended for him. The &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1511;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; signifies procul ab, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#024">Num 15:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#003">Pro 20:3</A>. He lies there like ne&#772;tzer nith&#8219;a&#770;b, i.e., like a branch torn off from the tree, that has withered and become offensive, or rather (as neetzer does not mean a branch, but a shoot) like a side-shoot that has been cut off the tree and thrown away with disgust as ugly, useless, and only a hindrance to the regular growth of the tree (possibly also an excrescence); nith&#8219;a&#770;b (cast away) is a pregnant expression, signifying "cast away with disgust." The place where he lies is the field of battle. A vaticinium post eventum would be expressed differently from this, as Luzzatto has correctly observed. For what Seder 'Olam says - namely, that Nebuchadnezzar's corpse was taken out of the grave by Evilmerodach, or as Abravanel relates it, by the Medo-Persian conquerors - is merely a conclusion drawn from the passage before us, and would lead us to expect &#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1514; rather than &#1492;&#1513;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;. It is a matter of indifference, so far as the truth of the prophecy is concerned, whether it was fulfilled in the person of Nebuchadnezzar I, or of that second Nebuchadnezzar who gave himself out as a son of Nabonet, and tried to restore the freedom of Babylon. The scene which passes before the mind of the prophet is the field of battle. To clear this they made a hole and throw stones (abne&#772;-bor, stones of the pit) on the top, without taking the trouble to shovel in the earth; but the king of Babylon is left lying there, like a carcase that is trampled under foot, and deserves nothing better than to be trampled under foot (mu&#772;ba&#770;s, part. hoph. of bu&#772;s, conculcare). They do not even think him worth throwing into a hole along with the rest of the corpses.

<p>"Thou art not united with them in burial, for thou hast destroyed thy land, murdered thy people: the seed of evil-doers will not be named for ever." In this way is vengeance taken for the tyrannical manner in which he has oppressed and exhausted his land, making his people the involuntary instruments of his thirst for conquest, and sacrificing them as victims to that thirst. For this reason he does not meet with the same compassion as those who have been compelled to sacrifice their lives in his service. And it is not only all over for ever with him, but it is so with his dynasty also. The prophet, the messenger of the penal justice of God, and the mouthpiece of that Omnipotence which regulates the course of history, commands this.

<p>"Prepare a slaughter-house for his sons, because of the iniquity of their fathers! They shall not rise and conquer lands, and fill the face of the earth with cities." They exhortation is addressed to the Medes, if the prophet had any particular persons in his mind at all. After the nocturnal storming of Babylon by the Medes, the new Babylonian kingdom and royal house which had been established by Nabopolassar vanished entirely from history. The last shoot of the royal family of Nabopolassar was slain as a child of conspirators. The second Nebuchadnezzar deceived the people (as Darius says in the great inscription of Behistan), declaring, "I am Nabukudrac ara the son of Nabunita." &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; (used poetically for &#1488;&#1500;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006">Isa 14:6</A> for &#1500;&#1488;) expresses a negative wish (as pen does a negative intention): Let no Babylonian kingdom ever arise again! Hitzig corrects &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; into &#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (heaps of ruins), Ewald into &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; (tyrants), Knobel into &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, and Meier into &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, which are said to signify conflicts, whilst Maurer will not take &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of cities, but of enemies. But there is no necessity for this at all. Nimrod, the first founder of a Babylonio-Assyrian kingdom, built cities to strengthen his monarchy. The king of Asshur built cities for the Medes, for the purpose of keeping them better in check. And it is to this building of cities, as a support to despotism, that the prophet here refers. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#022">Isaiah 14:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">isa 14:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Thus far the prophet has spoken in the name of God. But the prophecy closes with a word of God Himself, spoken through the prophet. "And I will rise up against them, saith Jehovah of hosts, and root out in Babel name and remnant, sprout and shoot, saith Jehovah. And make it the possession of hedgehogs and marshes of water, and sweep it away with the bosom of destruction, saith Jehovah of hosts." &#1513;&#1501; &#1493;&#1513;&#1488;&#1512; and &#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493;&#1504;&#1499;&#1491; are two pairs of alliterative proverbial words, and are used to signify "the whole, without exception" (compare the Arabic expression "Kiesel und Kies," "flint and pebble," in the sense of "altogether:" Nldecke, Poesie der alten Araber, p. 162). Jehovah rises against the descendants of the king of Babylon, and exterminates Babylon utterly, root and branch. The destructive forces, which Babylon has hitherto been able to control by raising artificial defences, are now let loose; and the Euphrates, left without a dam, lays the whole region under water. Hedgehogs now take the place of men, and marshes the place of palaces. The kippod occurs in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011">Isa 34:11</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014">Zep 2:14</A>, in the company of birds; but according to the derivation of the word and the dialects, it denotes the hedgehog, which possesses the power of rolling itself up (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;), and which, although it can neither fly, nor climb with any peculiar facility, on account of its mode of walking, could easily get upon the knob of a pillar that had been thrown down (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014">Zep 2:14</A>). The concluding threat makes the mode of Babel's origin the omen of its end: the city of &#1496;&#1497;&#1496;, i.e., Babylon, which had been built for the most part of clay or brick-earth, would be strangely swept away. The pilpel &#1496;&#1488;&#1496;&#1488; (or &#1496;&#1488;&#1496;&#1488;, as Kimchi conjugates it in Michlol 150ab, and in accordance with which some codices and early editions read &#1493;&#1496;&#1488;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; with double zere) belongs to the cognate root which is mentioned at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005">Psa 42:5</A>, with an opening &#1491;, &#1496;, &#1505; (cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008">Isa 27:8</A>), and which signifies to drive or thrust away. &#1502;&#1496;&#1488;&#1496;&#1488; is that with which anything is driven out or swept away, viz., a broom. Jehovah treats Babylon as rubbish, and sweeps it away, destruction (hashme&#772;d: an inf. absol. used as a substantive) serving Him as a broom. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024">Isaiah 14:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">isa 14:24</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>There now follows, apparently out of all connection, another prophecy against Asshur. It is introduced here quite abruptly, like a fragment; and it is an enigma how it got here, and what it means here, though not an enigma without solution. This short Assyrian passage reads as follows. "Jehovah of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, that takes place; to break Asshur to pieces in my land, and upon my mountain will I tread him under foot: then his yoke departs from them, and his burden will depart from their neck. This is the purpose that is purposed over the whole earth; and this the hand that is stretched out over all nations. For Jehovah of hosts hath purposed, and who could bring it to nought? And His hand that is stretched out, who can turn it back?" It is evidently a totally different judicial catastrophe which is predicted here, inasmuch as the world-power upon which it falls is not called Babel or Chasdim, but Asshur, which cannot possibly be taken as a name for Babylon (Abravanel, Lowth, etc.). Babylon is destroyed by the Medes, whereas Asshur falls to ruin in the mountain-land of Jehovah, which it is seeking to subjugate - a prediction which was literally fulfilled. And only when this had taken place did a fitting occasion present itself for a prophecy against Babel, the heiress of the ruined Assyrian power. Consequently the two prophecies against Babel and Asshur form a hysteron-proteron as they stand here. The thought which occasioned this arrangement, and which it is intended to set forth, is expressed by Jeremiah in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#018">Jer 50:18-19</A>, "Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria." The one event was a pledge of the other. At a time when the prophecy against Assyria had actually been fulfilled, the prophet attached it to the still unfulfilled prophecy against Babylon, to give a pledge of the fulfilment of the latter. This was the pedestal upon which the Massa&#770;h Ba&#770;bel was raised. And it was doubly suited for this, on account of its purely epilogical tone from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#026">Isa 14:26</A> onwards. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028">Isaiah 14:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">isa 14:28</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This is one of the prophecies the date of which is fixed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028">Isa 14:28</A>. "In the year of the death of king Ahaz the following oracle was uttered." "The year of the death of king Aha"Z was (as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001">Isa 6:1</A>) the year in which the death of Ahaz was to take place. In that year the Philistines still remained in those possessions, their hold of which was so shameful to Judah, and had not yet met with any humiliating retribution. But this year was the turning-point; for Hezekiah, the successor of Ahaz, not only recovered the cities that they had taken, but thoroughly defeated them in their own land (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008">Kg2 18:8</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029">Isaiah 14:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">isa 14:29</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>It was therefore in a most eventful and decisive year that Isaiah began to prophesy as follows. "Rejoice not so fully, O Philistia, that the rod which smote thee is broken to pieces; for out of the serpent's root comes forth a basilisk, and its fruit is a flying dragon." She&#772;bet macce&#772;k, "the rod which smote thee" (not "of him that smote thee," which is not so appropriate), is the Davidic sceptre, which had formerly kept the Philistines in subjection under David and Solomon, and again in more recent times since the reign of Uzziah. This sceptre was now broken to pieces, for the Davidic kingdom had been brought down by the Syro-Ephraimitish war, and had not been able to recover itself; and so far as its power over the surrounding nations was concerned, it had completely fallen to pieces. Philistia was thoroughly filled with joy in consequence, but this joy was all over now. The power from which Philistia had escaped was a common snake (na&#770;cha&#770;sh), which had been either cut to pieces, or had died out down to the very roots. But out of this root, i.e., out of the house of David, which had been reduced to the humble condition of its tribal house, there was coming forth a zepha&#8219;, a basilisk (regulus, as Jerome and other early translators render it: see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008">Isa 11:8</A>); and this basilisk, which is dangerous and even fatal in itself, as soon as it had reached maturity, would bring forth a winged dragon as its fruit. The basilisk is Hezekiah, and the flying dragon is the Messiah (this is the explanation given by the Targum); or, what is the same thing, the former is the Davidic government of the immediate future, the latter the Davidic government of the ultimate future. The figure may appear an inappropriate one, because the serpent is a symbol of evil; but it is not a symbol of evil only, but of a curse also, and a curse is the energetic expression of the penal justice of God. And it is as the executor of such a curse in the form of a judgment of God upon Philistia that the Davidic king is here described in a threefold climax as a snake or serpent. The selection of this figure may possibly have also been suggested by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#017">Gen 49:17</A>; for the saying of Jacob concerning Dan was fulfilled in Samson, the sworn foe of the Philistines. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030">Isaiah 14:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">isa 14:30</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The coming Davidic king is peace for Israel, but for Philistia death. "And the poorest of the poor will feed, and needy ones lie down in peace; and I kill thy root through hunger, and he slays thy remnant." "The poorest of the poor:" beco&#772;re&#772; dallim is an intensified expression for bene&#772; dallim, the latter signifying such as belong to the family of the poor, the former (cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#013">Job 18:13</A>, mors dirissima) such as hold the foremost rank in such a family - a description of Israel, which, although at present deeply, very deeply, repressed and threatened on every side, would then enjoy its land in quietness and peace (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#012">Zep 3:12-13</A>). In this sense &#1493;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; is used absolutely; and there is no necessity for Hupfeld's conjecture (Ps. ii. 258), that we should read &#1489;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; (in my pastures). Israel rises again, but Philistia perishes even to a root and remnant; and the latter again falls a victim on the one hand to the judgment of God (famine), and on the other to the punishment inflicted by the house of David. The change of persons in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030">Isa 14:30</A> is no synallage; but the subject to yaharo&#772;g (slays) is the basilisk, the father of the flying dragon. The first strophe of the massah terminates here. It consists of eight lines, each of the two Masoretic <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029">Isa 14:29</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030">Isa 14:30</A> containing four clauses. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031">Isaiah 14:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">isa 14:31</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The massah consists of two strophes. The first threatens judgment from Judah, and the second - of seven lines - threatens judgment from Asshur. "Howl, O gate! cry, O city! O Philistia, thou must melt entirely away; for from the north cometh smoke, and there is no isolated one among his hosts." &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, which is a masculine everywhere else, is construed here as a feminine, possibly in order that the two imperfects may harmonize; for there is nothing to recommend Luzzatto's suggestion, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; should be taken as an accusative. The strong gates of the Philistian cities (Ashdod and Gaza), of world-wide renown, and the cities themselves, shall lift up a cry of anguish; and Philistia, which has hitherto been full of joy, shall melt away in the heat of alarm (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#007">Isa 13:7</A>, na&#770;mo&#772;g, inf. abs. niph.; on the form itself, compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#013">Isa 59:13</A>): for from the north there comes a singing and burning fire, which proclaims its coming afar off by the smoke which it produces; in other words, an all-destroying army, out of whose ranks not one falls away from weariness or self-will (cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027">Isa 5:27</A>), that is to say, an army without a gap, animated throughout with one common desire. (&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, after the form &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1489;, the mass of people assembled at an appointed place, or mo&#772;'ed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#014">Jos 8:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#035">Sa1 20:35</A>, and for an appointed end.) 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#032">Isaiah 14:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">isa 14:32</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>To understand <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#032">Isa 14:32</A>, which follows here, nothing more is needed than a few simple parenthetical thoughts, which naturally suggest themselves. This one desire was the thirst for conquest, and such a desire could not possibly have only the small strip of Philistian coast for its object; but the conquest of this was intended as the means of securing possession of other countries on the right hand and on the left. The question arose, therefore, How would Judah fare with the fire which was rolling towards it from the north? For the very fact that the prophet of Judah was threatening Philistia with this fire, presupposed that Judah itself would not be consumed by it.
<p>And this is just what is expressed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#032">Isa 14:32</A> : "And what answer do the messengers of the nations bring? That Jehovah hath founded Zion, and that the afflicted of His people are hidden therein." "The messengers of the nations" (maleace&#772; goi): goi is to be taken in a distributive sense, and the messengers to be regarded either as individuals who have escaped from the Assyrian army, which was formed of contingents from many nations, or else (as we should expect pelite&#772; in that case, instead of mal'ace&#772;) messengers from the neighbouring nations, who were sent to Jerusalem after the Assyrian army had perished in front of the city, to ascertain how the latter had fared. And they all reply as if with one mouth (yaaneh): Zion has stood unshaken, protected by its God; and the people of this God, the poor and despised congregation of Jehovah (cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007">Zac 11:7</A>), are, and know that they are, concealed in Zion. The prophecy is intentionally oracular. Prophecy does not adopt the same tone to the nations as to Israel. Its language to the former is dictatorially brief, elevated with strong self-consciousness, expressed in lofty poetic strains, and variously coloured, according to the peculiarity of the nation to which the oracle refers. The following prophecy relating to Moab shows us very clearly, that in the prophet's view the judgment executed by Asshur upon Philistia would prepare the way for the subjugation of Philistia by the sceptre of David. By the wreck of the Assyrian world-power upon Jerusalem, the house of David would recover its old supremacy over the nations round about. And this really was the case. But the fulfilment was not exhaustive. Jeremiah therefore took up the prophecy of his predecessor again at the time of the Chaldean judgment upon the nations (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001">Jer 47:1-7</A>), but only the second strophe. The Messianic element of the first was continued by Zechariah (Zech 9).
