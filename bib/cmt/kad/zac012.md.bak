Israel's Conflict and Victory, Conversion and Sanctification - Zechariah
12:1-13:6

This section forms the first half of the second prophecy of Zechariah
concerning the future of Israel and of the nations of the world, viz.,
the prophecy contained in ch. 12-14, which, as a side-piece to ch. 9-11,
treats of the judgment by which Israel, the nation of God, will be
refined, sifted, and led on to perfection through conflict with the
nations of the world. This first section announces how the conflict
against Jerusalem and Judah will issue in destruction to the nations of
the world ([Zac 12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001).md). Jehovah will
endow the princes of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem with marvellous
strength to overcome all their foes ([Zac
12:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#005).md), and will pour out His Spirit
of grace upon them, so that they will bitterly repent the death of the
Messiah ([Zac 12:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md), and purify
themselves from all ungodliness ([Zac
13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001).md).

[Zechariah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 12:1</span></span>

"Burden of the word of Jehovah over Israel. Saying of Jehovah, who
stretches out the heaven, and lays the foundation of the earth, and
forms the spirit of man within him." This heading, which belongs to the
whole prophecy in ch. 12-14, corresponds in form and contents to that in
[Zac 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md). The burden of Jehovah over
Israel stands by the side of the burden of Jehovah over the land of
Hadrach, the seat of the heathen power of the world ([Zac
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001).md). And as the reason assigned for
the latter was that the eye of Jehovah looks at mankind and all the
tribes of Israel, so the former is explained here by an allusion to the
creative omnipotence of Jehovah. Only there is nothing in our heading to
answer to the words "and Damascus is his rest," which are added to the
explanation of the symbolical name Hadrach in [Zac
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md), because Israel, as the name of
the covenant nation, needed no explanation. The other formal differences
are very inconsiderable. על answers substantially to the ב (in בּארץ,
[Zac 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001).md), and signifies,
notwithstanding the fact that massa' announces a threatening word, not
"again" but "over," as we may see by comparing it with משּׂא אל ישׂ in
[Mal 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001.md). The reason for the massa'
announced is given here in the form of an apposition, נאם יהוה standing
first like a heading, as in [Psa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md);
[Sa2 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md); [Num
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md), [Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md). The predicates of God are
formed after [Isa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005.md) (see also [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013).md), and describe God as the creator
of the universe, and the former of the spirits of all men, to remove all
doubt as to the realization of the wonderful things predicted in what
follows. יצר רוּח וגו, the forming of the spirit within man, does not
refer to the creation of the spirits of souls of men once for all, but
denotes the continuous creative formation and guidance of the human
spirit by the Spirit of God. Consequently we cannot restrict the
stretching out of the heaven and the laying of the foundation of the
earth to the creation of the universe as an act accomplished once for
all tat the beginning of all things ([Gen
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001).md), but must take these words also
as referring to the upholding of the world as a work of the continuously
creative providence of God. According to the biblical view (cf. [Psa
104:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002).md), "God stretches out the
heavens every day afresh, and every day He lays the foundation of the
earth, which, if His power did not uphold it, would move from its orbit,
and fall into ruin" (Hengst.).

[Zechariah 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 12:2</span></span>

"Behold, I make Jerusalem a reeling-basin for all the nations round
about, and upon Judah also will it be at the siege against Jerusalem.
[Zac 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003.md). And it will come to pass on
that day, I will make Jerusalem a burden-stone to all nations: all who
lift it up will tear rents for themselves; and all the nations of the
earth will gather together against it. [Zac
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#004.md). In that day, is the saying of
Jehovah, will I smite every horse with shyness, and its rider with
madness, and over the house of Judah will I open my eyes, and every
horse of the nations will I smite with blindness." These verses allude
to an attack on the part of the nations upon Jerusalem and Judah, which
will result in injury and destruction to those who attack it. The Lord
will make Jerusalem a reeling-basin to all nations round about. Saph
does not mean threshold here, but basin, or a large bowl, as in [Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022.md). רעל is equivalent to תּרעלה in
[Isa 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md) and [Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005.md), viz., reeling. Instead of the
goblet, the prophet speaks of a basin, because many persons can put
their mouths to this at the same time, and drink out of it (Schmieder).
The "cup of reeling," i.e., a goblet filled with intoxicating drink, is
a figure very frequently employed to denote the divine judgment, which
intoxicates the nations, so that they are unable to stand any longer,
and therefore fall to the ground and perish (see at [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017).md).

[Psa 60:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002.md) has been explained in very
different ways. It is an old and widespread view, that the words "also
upon Judah will it be," etc., express the participation of Judah in the
siege of Jerusalem. The Chaldee and Jerome both adopt this explanation,
that in the siege of Jerusalem Judah will be constrained by the nations
to besiege the capital of its own land. The grammatical reason assigned
for this view is, that we must either take היה with על in the sense of
obligation (it will also be the duty of Judah: Mich., Ros., Ewald), or
supply סף־רעל as the subject to יהיה: the reeling-basin will also come
upon Judah. But there is great harshness in both explanations. With the
former, להלּחם, or some other infinitive, would hardly have been
omitted; and with the latter, the preposition ל would stand before
יהוּדה, instead of על. Moreover, in what follows there is no indication
whatever of Judah's having made common cause with the enemy against
Jerusalem; on the contrary, Judah and Jerusalem stand together in
opposition to the nations, and the princes of Judah have strength in the
inhabitants of Jerusalem ([Psa 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005).md),
and destroy the enemy to save Jerusalem ([Psa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006).md). Moreover, it is only by a false
interpretation that any one can find a conflict between Judah and
Jerusalem indicated in [Zac 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#014.md). And
throughout it is incorrect to designate the attitude of Judah towards
Jerusalem in these verses as "opposition," - a notion upon which Ebrard
(Offenb. Joh.) and Kliefoth have founded the marvellous view, that by
Jerusalem with its inhabitants and the house of David we are to
understand the unbelieving portion of Israel; and by Judah with its
princes, Christendom, or the true people of God, formed of believing
Israelites, and increased by believing Gentiles. Judah is not opposed to
Jerusalem, but simply distinguished from it, just as the Jewish kingdom
or people is frequently designated by the prophets as Jerusalem and
Judah. The גם, which does not separate, but adds, is of itself
inapplicable to the idea of opposition. Consequently we should expect
the words וגם על יה to express the thought, that Judah will be visited
with the same fate as Jerusalem, as Luther, Calvin, and many others
follow the Peshito in supposing that they do. היה על has then the
meaning to happen, to come over a person; and the only question is, What
are we to supply in thought as the subject? The best course is probably
to take it from the previous clause, "that which passes over Jerusalem;"
for the proposal of Koehler to supply mâtsōr as the subject is precluded
by the circumstance that mâtsōr, a siege, can only affect a city or
fortress (cf. [Deu 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#020).md), and not a
land. The thought is strengthened in [Zac
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003.md). Jerusalem is to become a
burden-stone for all nations, which inflicts contusions and wounds upon
those who try to lift it up or carry it away ("experiencing no hurt
itself, it causes great damage to them:" Marck). The figure is founded
upon the idea of the labour connected with building, and not upon the
custom, which Jerome speaks of as a very common one in his time among
the youth of Palestine, of testing and exercising their strength by
lifting heavy stones. There is a gradation in the thought, both in the
figure of the burdensome stone, which wounds whoever tries to lift it,
whilst intoxicating wine only makes one powerless and incapable of any
undertaking, and also in the description given of the object, viz., in
[Zac 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md) all nations round about
Jerusalem, and in [Zac 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003.md) all
peoples and all nations of the earth. It is only in the last clause of
[Zac 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003.md) that the oppression of
Jerusalem indicated in the two figures is more minutely described, and
in [Zac 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#004.md) that its overthrow by the
help of God is depicted. The Lord will throw the mind and spirit of the
military force of the enemy into such confusion, that instead of
injuring Jerusalem and Judah, it will rush forward to its own
destruction. Horses and riders individualize the warlike forces of the
enemy. The rider, smitten with madness, turns his sword against his own
comrades in battle (cf. [Zac 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003.md);
[Jdg 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022.md); [Sa1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#020).md). On the other hand, Jehovah
will open His eyes upon Judah for its protection ([Kg1
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029.md); [Neh
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#006.md); [Psa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008).md). This promise is strengthened by
the repetition of the punishment to be inflicted upon the enemy. Not
only with alarm, but with blindness, will the Lord smite their horses.
We have an example of this in [Kg2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#018.md), where the Lord smote the enemy
with blindness in answer to Elisha's prayer, i.e., with mental
blindness, so that, instead of seizing the prophet, they fell into the
hands of Israel. The three plagues, timmâhōn, shiggâ‛ōn, and ‛ivvârōn,
are those with which rebellious Israelites are threatened in [Deu
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#028.md). The "house of Judah" is the
covenant nation, the population of Judah including the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, as we may see from what follows.

[Zechariah 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 12:5</span></span>

[Zac 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#005.md). "And the princes of Judah
will say in their hearts, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are strength to
me, in Jehovah of hosts their God. [Zac
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006.md). On that day will I make the
princes of Judah as a basin of fire under logs of wood, and like a torch
of fire under sheaves; and they will devour all nations round about, on
the right and on the left; and Jerusalem will dwell still further in its
place, at Jerusalem. [Zac 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#007.md). And
Jehovah will save the tents of Judah first, that the splendour of the
house of David and the splendour of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not
lift itself up over Judah." The princes of Judah are mentioned as the
leaders of the people in war. What they say is the conviction of the
whole nation ('allūph, as in [Zac
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#007)). אמצה (in this form ἁπ. λεγ..md) is
a substantive = אמץ, strength ([Job
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#009)). The singular lı̄ (to me.md)
expresses the fact that every individual says or thinks this, as with
the expression "should I weep" in [Zac
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003.md). The princes of Judah recognise in
the inhabitants of Jerusalem their strength or might, not in this sense,
that Judah, being crowded together before Jerusalem, expects help
against the foe from the strength of the city and the assistance of its
inhabitants, as Hofmann and Koehler maintain, for "their whole account
of the inhabitants of the land being shut up in the city (or crowded
together before the walls of Jerusalem, and covered by them) is a pure
invention" (Koehler), and has no foundation in the text; but in this
sense, that the inhabitants of Jerusalem are strong through Jehovah
their God, i.e., through the fact that Jehovah has chosen Jerusalem, and
by virtue of this election will save the city of His sanctuary (compare
[Zac 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#012.md) with [Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002.md); [Zac
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#017.md); [Zac
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012).md). Because the princes of Judah
put their trust in the divine election of Jerusalem, the Lord makes them
into a basin of fire under logs of wood, and a burning torch under
sheaves, so that they destroy all nations round about like flames of
fire, and Jerusalem therefore remains unconquered and undestroyed in its
place at Jerusalem. In this last sentence Jerusalem is first of all the
population personified as a woman, and in the second instance the city
as such. From the fact that Jerusalem is still preserved, in consequence
of the destruction of the enemy proceeding from the princes of Judah it
is very evident that the princes of Judah are the representatives of the
whole nation, and that the whole of the covenant nation (Judah with
Jerusalem) is included in the house of Judah in [Zac
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#004.md). And [Zac
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#007.md) may easily be reconciled with
this. The statement that the Lord will "save the tents of Judah first,
that the splendour of the house of David may not lift itself up above
Judah," contains the simple thought that the salvation will take place
in such a manner that no part of the nation will have any occasion to
lift itself up above another, and that because the salvation is effected
not by human power, but by the omnipotence of God alone. "The tents of
Judah, i.e., its huts, form an antithesis to the splendid buildings of
the capital, and probably (?) also point to the defenceless condition of
Judah, through which it was absolutely cast upon the help of God"

(Note: Calvin observes: "In my opinion, the prophet applies the term
'tents' to huts which cannot protect their guests or inhabitants. We
have thus a tacit contrast between huts and fortified cities.")

(Hengstenberg). תּפארת, the splendour or glory, not the boasting. The
house of David is the royal line, which was continued in Zerubbabel and
his family, and culminated in Christ. Its splendour consists in the
glorification promised in [Zac 4:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006.md)
and [Zac 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014.md), and [Hag
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023.md); and the splendour of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem is the promises which this city received
through its election to be the city of God, in which Jehovah would be
enthroned in His sanctuary, and also through the future glorification
predicted for it in consequence ([Zac
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#016.md); [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008.md), [Zac
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012), ff..md). The antithesis between
Jerusalem and the house of David on the one hand, and the tents of Judah
on the other, does not serve to express the thought that "the strong
ones will be saved by the weak, in order that the true equilibrium may
arise between the two" (Hengst.), for Judah cannot represent the weak
ones if its princes consume the enemy like flames of fire; but the
thought is simply this: At the deliverance from the attack of the foe,
Jerusalem will have no pre-eminence over Judah; but the promises which
Jerusalem and the house of David have received will benefit Judah, i.e.,
the whole of the covenant nation, in like manner. This thought is
expressed in the following way: The defenceless land will be delivered
sooner than the well-defended capital, that the latter may not lift
itself up above the former, but that both may humbly acknowledge "that
the victory in both cases is the Lord's" (Jerome); for, according to
[Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008.md), Jerusalem will enjoy in the
fullest measure the salvation of God.

[Zechariah 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 12:8</span></span>

[Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008.md). "On that day Jehovah will
shelter the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that stumbleth among them
will be as David on that day; and the house of David as God, as the
angel of Jehovah before them. [Zac
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009.md). And it will come to pass on that
day, I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against
Jerusalem." In the conflict with the heathen nations, the Lord will
endow the inhabitants of Jerusalem with marvellous strength with which
to overcome all their foes. The population of Jerusalem is divided into
two classes, the weak and the strong. The weak are designated as
hannikhshâl, the stumbling one, who cannot stand firmly upon his feet
([Sa1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#004).md). These are to become like
David, the bravest hero of Israel (cf. [Sa1
17:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034.md)., [Sa2
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#008).md). The strong ones, designated as
the house, i.e., the household or family of David, are to be like
Elohim, i.e., not angels, but God, the Deity, i.e., a superhuman being
(cf. [Psa 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006).md), yea, like the angel of
Jehovah, who goes before Israel (לפניהם), or the revealer of the
invisible God, who is essentially the equal of Jehovah (see at [Zac
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008).md). The point of comparison lies in
the power and strength, not in moral resemblance to God, as Kliefoth
supposes, who takes Elohim as equivalent to Jehovah, and identifies it
with the angel of Jehovah, as some of the earlier commentators have
done, and places the graduation of Elohim into the angel of Jehovah in
the appearance of God in human form, in which case, however, לפניהם has
no meaning. This shows rather that the "angel of Jehovah" is simply
referred to here in connection with his appearance in the history of
Israel, when he went at the head of Israel and smote the Egyptians and
all the enemies of Israel ([Exo
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md).; [Jos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013)..md). This is evident from the
antithesis in [Zac 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009.md). Whilst
Jehovah endows the inhabitants of Jerusalem with supernatural strength,
He will seek to destroy all the nations which attack Jerusalem. Biqqēsh,
followed by an infinitive with Lamed, to strive after anything, as in
[Zac 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007.md). בּוא על applied to the
advance of the enemy against a city (= עלה על, [Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001).md).

[Zechariah 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 12:10</span></span>

But the Lord will do still more than this for His people. He will renew
it by pouring out His spirit of grace upon it, so that it will come to
the knowledge of the guilt it has incurred by the rejection of the
Saviour, and will bitterly repent of its sin. [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md). "And I will pour out upon the
house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of
grace and of supplication; and they will look upon me, whom they have
pierced, and will mourn over him like the mourning over an only one, and
will grieve bitterly over him, as one grieves bitterly over the
first-born." This new promise is simply attached to the previous verse
by ו consec. (ושׁפכתּי). Through this mode of attachment such
connections as that suggested by Kliefoth, "But such glory can only be
enjoyed by rebellious Israel when it is converted, and acknowledges and
bewails Him whom it has rejected," are precluded, as at variance with
the text. There is not a word in the text about conversion as the
condition on which the glory set before them in [Zac
12:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003.md) was to be obtained; on the
contrary, conversion is represented as one fruit of the outpouring of
the spirit of prayer upon the nation; and this outpouring of the Spirit
is introduced by ושׁפכתּי, which corresponds to אבקּשׁ in [Zac
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009.md), as a new feature in the
salvation, to be added to the promise of the destruction of the nations
which fight against Jerusalem. The fact that only the inhabitants of
Jerusalem are named, and not those of Judah also, is explained correctly
by the commentators from the custom of regarding the capital as the
representative of the whole nation. And it follows eo ipso from this,
that in [Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008.md) also the expression
"inhabitants of Jerusalem" is simply an individualizing epithet for the
whole of the covenant nation. But just as in [Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008.md) the house of David is mentioned
emphatically along with these was the princely family and representative
of the ruling class, so is it also in [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md), for the purpose of expressing
the thought that the same salvation is to be enjoyed by the whole
nation, in all its ranks, from the first to the last. The outpouring of
the Spirit points back to [Joe 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001.md).,
except that there the Spirit of Jehovah generally is spoken of, whereas
here it is simply the spirit of grace and of supplication. Chēn does not
mean "prayer," nor emotion, or goodness, or love (Hitzig, Ewald), but
simply grace or favour; and here, as in [Zac
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007.md), the grace of God; not indeed in
its objectivity, but as a principle at work in the human mind. The
spirit of grace is the spirit which produces in the mind of man the
experience of the grace of God. But this experience begets in the soul
of sinful man the knowledge of sin and guilt, and prayer for the
forgiveness of sin, i.e., supplication; and this awakens sorrow and
repentance. הבּיטוּ אלי, they look upon me. Hibbı̄t, used of bodily sight
as well as spiritual (cf. [Num 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#009).md).
The suffix in אלי (to me) refers to the speaker. This is Jehovah,
according to [Zac 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md), the creator of
the heaven and the earth. את־אשׁר דּקרוּ, not "Him whom they pierced,"
but simply "whom they pierced." את, that is to say, is not governed by
hibbı̄tū as a second object, but simply refers to אלי, to me, "whom they
pierced," את־אשׁר is chosen here, as in [Jer
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#009.md), in the place of the simple אשׁר,
to mark אשׁר more clearly as an accusative, since the simple אשׁר might
also be rendered "who pierced (me):" cf. Ges. 123, 2, Not. 1. Dâqar does
not mean to ridicule, or scoff at, but only to pierce, thrust through,
and to slay by any kind of death whatever (cf. [Lam
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009).md). And the context shows that here
it signifies to put to death. With reference to the explanation proposed
by Calvin, "whom they have harassed with insults," Hitzig has very
properly observed: "If it were nothing more than this, wherefore such
lamentation over him, which, according to the use of ספד, with על
governing the person, and from the similes employed, is to be regarded
as a lamentation for the dead?" It is true that we have not to think of
a slaying of Jehovah, the creator of the heaven and the earth, but
simply of the slaying of the Maleach Jehovah, who, being of the same
essence with Jehovah, became man in the person of Jesus Christ. As
Zechariah repeatedly represents the coming of the Messiah as a coming of
Jehovah in His Maleach to His people, he could, according to this view,
also describe the slaying of the Maleach as the slaying of Jehovah. And
Israel having come to the knowledge of its sin, will bitterly bewail
this deed. עליו does not mean thereat, i.e., at the crime, but is used
personally, over him whom they have pierced. Thus the transition from
the first person (אלי) to the third (עליו) points to the fact that the
person slain, although essentially one with Jehovah, is personally
distinct from the Supreme God. The lamentation for the only son (yâshı̄d:
cf. [Amo 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010).md) and for the first-born
is the deepest and bitterest death-wail. The inf. abs. hâmēr, which is
used in the place of the finite verb, signifies making bitter, to which
mispēd is to be supplied from the previous sentence (cf. מספּד
תּמרוּרים, [Jer 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026).md).

The historical fulfilment of this prophecy commenced with the
crucifixion of the Son of God, who had come in the flesh. The words
הבּיטוּ אלי את־אשׁר דּקרוּ are quoted in the Gospel of John ([Joh
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#037).md), according to the Greek
rendering ὄψονται εἰς ὅν ἐξεκέντησαν, which probably emanated not from
the lxx, but from Aquila, or Theodotion, or Symmachus, as having been
fulfilled in Christ, by the fact that a soldier pierced His side with a
lance as He was hanging upon the cross (vid., [Joh
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#034).md). If we compare this quotation
with the fact mentioned in [Joh 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#036.md),
that they did not break any of His bones, there can be no doubt that
John quotes this passage with distinct allusion to this special
circumstance; only we must not infer from this, that the evangelist
regarded the meaning of the prophecy as exhausted by this allusion. The
piercing with the spear is simply looked upon by him as the climax of
all the mortal sufferings of Christ; and even with Zechariah the
piercing is simply an individualizing expression for putting to death,
the instrument used and the kind of death being of very subordinate
importance. This is evident from a comparison of our verse with [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md), where the sword is mentioned as
the instrument employed, whereas dâqar points rather to a spear. What we
have observed respecting the fulfilment of [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md) by the entry of Christ into
Jerusalem, also applies to this special fulfilment, viz., that the so to
speak literal fulfilment in the outward circumstances only served to
make the internal concatenation of the prophecy with its historical
realization so clear, that even unbelievers could not successfully deny
it. Luke ([Luk 23:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#048).md) indicates the
commencement of the fulfilment of the looking at the slain one by these
words: "And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding
the things which were done, smote their breasts." (For the smiting of
the breasts, comp. [Isa 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#012.md), ספד על
שׁדים.) "The crowds, who had just before been crying out, Crucify him,
here smite upon their breasts, being overpowered with the proofs of the
superhuman exaltation of Jesus, and lament over the crucified one, and
over their own guilt" (Hengst.). The true and full commencement of the
fulfilment, however, shows itself in the success which attended the
preaching of Peter on the first day of Pentecost, - namely, in the fact
that three thousand were pricked in their heart with penitential sorrow
on account of the crucifixion of their Saviour, and were baptized in the
name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins ([Act
2:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037).md), and in the further results
which followed the preaching of the apostles for the conversion of
Israel (Acts 3-4). The fulfilment has continued with less striking
results through the whole period of the Christian church, in conversions
from among the Jews; and it will not terminate till the remnant of
Israel shall turn as a people to Jesus the Messiah, whom its fathers
crucified. On the other hand, those who continue obstinately in unbelief
will see Him at last when He returns in the clouds of heaven, and shriek
with despair ([Rev 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007.md); [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030).md).

[Zechariah 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 12:11</span></span>

In [Zac 12:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011.md) the magnitude and
universality of the mourning are still further depicted. [Zac
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011.md). "In that day the mourning in
Jerusalem will be great, like the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the valley
of Megiddo. [Zac 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#012.md). And the land
will mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart,
and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and
their wives apart. [Zac 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#013.md). The
family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of
the Shimeite apart, and their wives apart. [Zac
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#014.md). All the rest of the families,
every family apart, and their wives apart." In [Zac
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011.md), the depth and bitterness of the
pain on account of the slain Messiah are depicted by comparing it to the
mourning of Hadad-rimmon. Jerome says with regard to this: "Adad-remmon
is a city near Jerusalem, which was formerly called by this name, but is
now called Maximianopolis, in the field of Mageddon, where the good king
Josiah was wounded by Pharaoh Necho." This statement of Jerome is
confirmed by the fact that the ancient Canaanitish or Hebrew name of the
city has been preserved in Rmuni, a small village three-quarters of an
hour to the south of Lejun (Legio = Megiddo: see at [Jos
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#021.md); and V. de Velde, Reise, i. p.
267). The mourning of Hadad-rimmon is therefore the mourning for the
calamity which befel Israel at Hadad-rimmon in the death of the good
king Josiah, who was mortally wounded in the valley Megiddo, according
to [Ch2 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#022.md)., so that he very soon
gave up the ghost. The death of this most pious of all the kings of
Judah was bewailed by the people, especially the righteous members of
the nation, so bitterly, that not only did the prophet Jeremiah compose
an elegy on his death, but other singers, both male and female, bewailed
him in dirges, which were placed in a collection of elegiac songs, and
preserved in Israel till long after the captivity ([Ch2
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025).md). Zechariah compares the
lamentation for the putting of the Messiah to death to this great
national mourning. All the other explanations that have been given of
these words are so arbitrary, as hardly to be worthy of notice. This
applies, for example, to the idea mentioned by the Chald., that the
reference is to the death of the wicked Ahab, and also to Hitzig's
hypothesis, that Hadad-rimmon was the one name of the god Adonis. For,
apart from the fact that it is only from this passage that Movers has
inferred that there ever was an idol of that name, a prophet of Jehovah
could not possibly have compared the great lamentation of the Israelites
over the death of the Messiah to the lamentation over the death of Ahab
the ungodly king of Israel, or to the mourning for a Syrian idol. But
the mourning will not be confined to Jerusalem; the land (hâ'ârets),
i.e., the whole nation, will also mourn. This universality of the
lamentation is individualized in [Zac
12:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#012.md), and so depicted as to show
that all the families and households of the nation mourn, and not the
men only, but also the women. To this end the prophet mentions four
distinct leading and secondary families, and then adds in conclusion,
"all the rest of the families, with their wives." Of the several
families named, two can be determined with certainty, - namely, the
family of the house of David, i.e., the posterity of king David, and the
family of the house of Levi, i.e., the posterity of the patriarch Levi.
But about the other two families there is a difference of opinion. The
rabbinical writers suppose that Nathan is the well known prophet of that
name, and the family of Shimei the tribe of Simeon, which is said,
according to the rabbinical fiction, to have furnished teachers to the
nation.

(Note: Jerome gives the Jewish view thus: "In David the regal tribe is
included, i.e., Judah. In Nathan the prophetic order is described. Levi
refers to the priests, from whom the priesthood sprang. In Simeon the
teachers are included, as the companies of masters sprang from that
tribe. He says nothing about the other tribes, as they had no special
privilege of dignity.")

But the latter opinion is overthrown, apart from any other reason, by
the fact that the patronymic of Simeon is not written שׁמעי, but שׁמעני,
in [Jos 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#004.md); [Ch1
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016.md). Still less can the Benjamite
Shimei, who cursed David ([Sa2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005)..md),
be intended. משׁפּחת השּׁמעי is the name given in [Num
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#021.md) to the family of the son of
Gershon and the grandson of Levi ([Num
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#017)..md). This is the family intended
here, and in harmony with this Nathan is not the prophet of that name,
but the son of David, from whom Zerubbabel was descended ([Luk
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#027.md), [Luk
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#031).md). Luther adopted this
explanation: "Four families," he says, "are enumerated, two from the
royal line, under the names of David and Nathan, and two from the
priestly line, as Levi and Shimei; after which he embraces all
together." Of two tribes he mentions one leading family and one
subordinate branch, to show that not only are all the families of Israel
in general seized with the same grief, but all the separate branches of
those families. Thus the word mishpâchâh is used here, as in many other
cases, in the wider and more restricted meaning of the leading and the
subordinate families.
