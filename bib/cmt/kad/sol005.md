### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 5:1</span></span>

She gives herself to him, and he has accepted her, and now celebrates
the delight of possession and enjoyment.

1 I am come into my garden, my sister-bride;

Have plucked my myrrh with my balsam;

Have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;

Have drunk my wine with my milk -

Eat, drink, and be drunken, ye friends!

If the exclamation of Solomon, 1a, is immediately connected with the
words of Shulamith, [Sol 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016.md), then we
must suppose that, influenced by these words, in which the ardour of
love and humility express themselves, he thus in triumph exclaims, after
he has embraced her in his arms as his own inalienable possession. But
the exclamation denotes more than this. It supposes a union of love,
such as is the conclusion of marriage following the betrothal, the
God-ordained aim of sexual love within the limits fixed by morality. The
poetic expression בּאתי לגנּי points to the אל eht ot בּוא, used of the
entrance of a man into the woman's chamber, to which the expression
(Arab.) dakhal bihā (he went in with her), used of the introduction into
the bride's chamber, is compared. The road by which Solomon reached this
full and entire possession was not short, and especially for his longing
it was a lengthened one. He now triumphs in the final enjoyment which
his ardent desire had found. A pleasant enjoyment which is reached in
the way and within the limits of the divine order, and which therefore
leaves no bitter fruits of self-reproach, is pleasant even in the
retrospect. His words, beginning with "I am come into my garden,"
breathe this pleasure in the retrospect. Ginsburg and others render
incorrectly, "I am coming," which would require the words to have been
בּא אני (הנּה). The series of perfects beginning with באתי cannot be
meant otherwise than retrospectively. The "garden" is Shulamith herself,
[Sol 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012.md), in the fulness of her
personal and spiritual attractions, [Sol
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016.md); cf. כּרמי, [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md). He may call her "my
sister-bride;" the garden is then his by virtue of divine and human
right, he has obtained possession of this garden, he has broken its
costly rare flowers.

ארה (in the Mishna dialect the word used of plucking figs) signifies to
pluck; the Aethiop. trans. ararku karbê, I have plucked myrrh; for the
Aethiop. has arara instead of simply ארה. בּשׂמי is here שׂבּם
deflected. While בּשׂם, with its plur. besâmim, denotes fragrance in
general, and only balsam specially, bāsām = (Arab.) bashâm is the proper
name of the balsam-tree (the Mecca balsam), amyris opobalsamum, which,
according to Forskal, is indigenous in the central mountain region of
Jemen (S. Arabia); it is also called (Arab.) balsaman; the word found
its way in this enlarged form into the West, and then returned in the
forms בּלסמון, אפּופלסמון, אפּלרלסמא (Syr. afrusomo), into the East.
Balsam and other spices were brought in abundance to King Solomon as a
present by the Queen of Sheba, [Kg1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010.md); the celebrated balsam
plantations of Jericho (vid., Winer's Real-W.), which continued to be
productive till the Roman period, might owe their origin to the friendly
relations which Solomon sustained to the south Arab. princess. Instead
of the Indian aloe, [Sol 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#014.md), the
Jamanic balsam is here connected with myrrh as a figure of Shulamith's
excellences. The plucking, eating, and drinking are only interchangeable
figurative descriptions of the enjoyment of love.

"Honey and milk," says Solomon, [Sol
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011.md), "is under thy tongue." יער is
like יערה, [Sa1 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027.md), the comb
(favus) or cells containing the honey, - a designation which has perhaps
been borrowed from porous lava.

(Note: Vid., Wetstein in the Zeitsch. fr allgem. Erdkunde, 1859, p.
123.)

With honey and milk "under the tongue" wine is connected, to which, and
that of the noblest kind, [Sol 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#010.md),
Shulamith's palate is compared. Wine and milk together are οἰνόγαλα,
which Chloe presents to Daphnis (Longus, i. 23). Solomon and his Song
here hover on the pinnacle of full enjoyment; but if one understands his
figurative language as it interprets itself, it here also expresses that
delight of satisfaction which the author of [Psa
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006.md) transfers to the countenance of
the rising sun, in words of a chaste purity which sexual love never
abandons, in so far as it is connected with esteem for a beloved wife,
and with the preservation of mutual personal dignity. For this very
reason the words of Solomon, 1a, cannot be thought of as spoken to the
guests. Between [Sol 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016.md) and [Sol
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md) the bridal night intervenes. The
words used in 1a are Solomon's morning salutation to her who has now
wholly become his own. The call addressed to the guests at the feast is
given forth on the second day of the marriage, which, according to
ancient custom, [Gen 29:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#028.md); [Jdg
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#012.md), was wont to be celebrated for
seven days, Tob. 11:18. The dramatical character of the Song leads to
this result, that the pauses are passed over, the scenes are quickly
changed, and the times appear to be continuous.

The plur. דּודים Hengst. thinks always designates "love" (Liebe); thus,
after [Pro 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#018.md), also here: Eat,
friends, drink and intoxicate yourselves in love. But the summons,
inebriamini amoribus, has a meaning if regarded as directed by the
guests to the married pair, but not as directed to the guests. And while
we may say רוה דדים, yet not שׁכר דו, for shakar has always only the
accus. of a spirituous liquor after it. Therefore none of the old
translators (except only the Venet.: μεθύσθητε ἔρωσιν) understood dodim,
notwithstanding that elsewhere in the Song it means love, in another
than a personal sense; רעים and דח are here the plur. of the elsewhere
parallels רע and דּוד, e.g., [Sol
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016.md), according to which also (cf. on
the contrary, [Sol 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016).md) they are
accentuated. Those who are assembled are, as sympathizing friends, to
participate in the pleasures of the feast. The Song of Songs has here
reached its climax. A Paul would not hesitate, after [Eph
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031.md)., to extend the mystical
interpretation even to this. Of the antitype of the marriage pair it is
said: "For the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made
herself ready" ([Rev 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007).md); and of the
antitype of the marriage guests: "Blessed are they which are called unto
the marriage supper of the Lamb" ([Rev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 5:2</span></span>

2 I sleep, but my heart keeps waking-

Hearken! my beloved is knocking:

Open to me, my sister, my love,

My dove, my perfect one;

For my head is filled with dew,

My locks (are) full of the drops of the night.

The partic. subst. clauses, [Sol 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md),
indicate the circumstances under which that which is related in [Sol
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md) occurred. In the principal
sentence in hist. prose ויּדפּק would be used; here, in the dramatic
vivacity of the description, is found in its stead the interject. vocem
= ausculta with the gen. foll., and a word designating

(Note: דּופק is knocking is not an attribute to the determinate דּודי my
beloved which it follows, but a designation of state or condition, and
thus acc., as the Beirut translation renders it: "hear my beloved in the
condition of one knocking." On the other hand, דוד דופק signifies "a
beloved one knocking." But "hear a beloved one knocking" would also be
expressed acc. In classical language, the designation of state, if the
subst. to which it belongs is indeterminate, is placed before it, e.g.,
"at the gate stood a beloved one knocking.")

state or condition added, thought of as accus. according to the Semitic
syntax (like [Gen 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md); [Jer
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#022.md); cf. [Kg1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#006).md). To sleep while the heart wakes
signifies to dream, for sleep and distinct consciousness cannot be
coexistent; the movements of thought either remain in obscurity or are
projected as dreams. ער = ‛awir is formed from עוּר, to be awake (in its
root cogn. to the Aryan gar, of like import in γρηγορεῖν, ἐγείρειν), in
the same way as מת = mawith from מוּת. The שׁ has here the conj. sense
of "dieweil" (because), like asher in [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md); [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md). The ר dag., which occurs several
times elsewhere (vid., under [Pro 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008.md);
[Pro 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#010).md), is one of the
inconsistencies of the system of punctuation, which in other instances
does not double the ר; perhaps a relic of the Babylonian idiom, which
was herein more accordant with the lingual nature of the r than the
Tiberian, which treated it as a semi-guttural. קוצּה, a lock of hair,
from קץ = קיץ, abscdit, follows in the formation of the idea, the
analogy of קציר, in the sense of branch, from קצר, desecuit; one so
names a part which is removed without injury to the whole, and which
presents itself conveniently for removal; cf. the oath sworn by Egyptian
women, laḥajât muḳṣu̇si, "by the life of my separated," i.e., "of my
locks" (Lane, Egypt, etc., I 38). The word still survives in the Talmud
dialect. Of a beautiful young man who proposed to become a Nazarite,
Nedarim 9a says the same as the Jer. Horajoth iii. 4 of a man who was a
prostitute in Rome: his locks were arranged in separate masses, like
heap upon heap; in Bereshith rabba c. lxv., under [Gen
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#011.md), קוּץ, curly-haired, is placed
over against קרח, bald-headed, and the Syr. also has ḳauṣoto as the
designation of locks of hair-a word used by the Peshito as the rendering
of the Heb. קוצּות, as the Syro-Hexap. [Job
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#012.md), the Greek κόμη. טל, from טלל
(Arab. ṭll, to moisten, viz., the ground; to squirt, viz., blood), is in
Arabic drizzling rain, in Heb. dew; the drops of the night (רסיסי, from
רסס, to sprinkle, to drizzle)

(Note: According to the primary idea: to break that which is solid or
fluid into little pieces, wherefore רסיסים means also broken pieces. To
this root appertains also the Arab. rashh, to trickle through, to sweat
through, II to moisten (e.g., the mouth of a suckling with milk), and
the Aethiop. rasěḥa, to be stained. Drops scattered with a sprinkling
brush the Arabs call rashaḥât; in the mystical writings, rashaḥât el-uns
(dew-drops of intimacy) is the designation of sporadic gracious glances
of the deity.)

are just drops of dew, for the precipitation of the damp air assumes
this form in nights which are not so cold as to become frosty. Shulamith
thus dreams that her beloved seeks admission to her. He comes a long way
and at night. In the most tender words he entreats for that which he
expects without delay. He addresses her, "my sister," as one of equal
rank with himself, and familiar as a sister with a brother; "my love"
(רע), as one freely chosen by him to intimate fellowship; "my dove," as
beloved and prized by him on account of her purity, simplicity, and
loveliness. The meaning of the fourth designation used by him, תּמּתי,
is shown by the Arab. tam to be "wholly devoted," whence teim, "one
devoted" = a servant, and mutajjam, desperately in love with one. In
addressing her tmty, he thus designates this love as wholly undivided,
devoting itself without evasion and without reserve. But on this
occasion this love did not approve itself, at least not at once.

3 I have put off my dress,

How shall I put it on again?

I have washed my feet,

How shall I defile them again?

She now lies unclothed in bed. כּתּנת is the χιτών worn next to the
body, from כתן, linen (diff. from the Arab. ḳuṭun, cotton, whence French
coton, calico = cotton-stuff). She had already washed her feet, from
which it is supposed that she had throughout the day walked barefooted,
- how (איככה, how? both times with the tone on the penult.;

(Note: That it has the tone on the penult., like כּכה, e.g., [Sol
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009.md), is in conformity with the
paragog. nature of .ה The tone, however, when the following word in
close connection begins with ,א goes to the ult., [Est
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#006.md). That this does not occur in איך
אל, is explained from the circumstance that the word has the disjunctive
Tifcha. But why not in איך אט? I think it is for the sake of the rhythm.
Pinsker, Einl. p. 184, seeks to change the accentuation in order that
the penult. accent might be on the second איך, but that is not
necessary. Cf. [Psa 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007)..md)

cf. איכה, where ? [Sol 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007).md) should she
again put on her dress, which she had already put off and laid aside
(פּשׁט)? why should she soil (אטנּפם, relating to the fem. רגלי, for
אטנפן) again her feet, that had been washed clean? Shulamith is here
brought back to the customs as well as to the home of her earlier rural
life; but although she should thus have been enabled to reach a deeper
and more lively consciousness of the grace of the king, who stoops to an
equality with her, yet she does not meet his love with an equal
requital. She is unwilling for his sake to put herself to trouble, or to
do that which is disagreeable to her. It cannot be thought that such an
interview actually took place; and yet what she here dreamed had not
only inward reality, but also full reality. For in a dream, that which
is natural to us or that which belongs to our very constitution becomes
manifest, and much that is kept down during our waking hours by the
power of the will, by a sense of propriety, and by the activities of
life, comes to light during sleep; for fancy then stirs up the ground of
our nature and brings it forth in dreams, and thus exposes us to
ourselves in such a way as oftentimes, when we waken, to make us ashamed
and alarmed. Thus it was with Shulamith. In the dream it was inwardly
manifest that she had lost her first love. She relates it with sorrow;
for scarcely had she rejected him with these unworthy deceitful
pretences when she comes to herself again.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 5:4</span></span>

4 My beloved stretched his hand through the opening,

And my heart was moved for him.

חוּר,

(Note: Cf. the Arab. ghawr (ghôr), as a sinking of the earth, and khawr
(khôr), as a breaking through, and, as it were, a piercing. The mouth of
a river is also called khôr, because there the sea breaks into the riv.)

from the verb חוּר, in the sense of to break through (R. חר, whence also
חרז, [Sol 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#010.md), and חרם, Arab. kharam,
part. broken through, e.g., of a lattice-window), signifies foramen, a
hole, also caverna (whence the name of the Troglodytes, חרי, and the
Haurn, חורן), here the loophole in the door above (like khawkht, the
little door for the admission of individuals in the street or
house-door). It does not properly mean a window, but a part of the door
pierced through at the upper part of the lock of the door (the
door-bolt). מן־החור is understood from the standpoint of one who is
within; "by the opening from without to within," thus "through the
opening;" stretching his hand through the door-opening as if to open the
door, if possible, by the pressing back of the lock from within, he
shows how greatly he longed after Shulamith. And she was again very
deeply moved when she perceived this longing, which she had so coldly
responded to: the interior of her body, with the organs which, after the
bibl. idea, are the seat of the tenderest emotions, or rather, in which
they reflect themselves, both such as are agreeable and such as are
sorrowful, groaned within her, - an expression of deep sympathy so
common, that "the sounding of the bowels," [Isa
63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md), an expression used, and that
anthropopathically of God Himself, is a direct designation of sympathy
or inner participation. The phrase here wavers between עליו and עלי
(thus, e.g., Nissel, 1662). Both forms are admissible. It is true we say
elsewhere only naphshi 'ālai, ruhi 'ālai, libbi 'ālai, for the Ego
distinguishes itself from its substance (cf. System d. bibl.
Psychologie, p. 151f.); meai 'alai, instead of bi (בּקרבּ), would,
however, be also explained from this, that the bowels are meant, not
anatomically, but as psychical organs. But the old translators (lxx,
Targ., Syr., Jerome, Venet.) rendered עליו, which rests on later MS
authority (vid., Norzi, and de Rossi), and is also more appropriate: her
bowels are stirred, viz., over him, i.e., on account of him (Alkabez:
בעבורו). As she will now open to him, she is inwardly more ashamed, as
he has come so full of love and longing to make her glad.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 5:5</span></span>

5 I arose to open to my beloved,

And my hands dropped with myrrh,

And my fingers with liquid myrrh,

On the handle of the bolt.

The personal pron. אני stands without emphasis before the verb which
already contains it; the common language of the people delights in such
particularity. The Book of Hosea, the Ephraimite prophet's work, is
marked by such a style. עבר מור, with which the parallel clause goes
beyond the simple mōr, is myrrh flowing over, dropping out of itself,
i.e., that which breaks through the bark of the balsamodendron myrrha,
or which flows out if an incision is made in it; myrrha stacte, of which
Pliny (xii. 35) says: cui nulla praefertur, otherwise דּרור מר, from
דּרר, to gush out, to pour itself forth in rich jets. He has come
perfumed as if for a festival, and the costly ointment which he brought
with him has dropped on the handles of the bolts (מנעוּל, keeping
locked, after the form מלבּוּשׁ, drawing on), viz., the inner bolt,
which he wished to withdraw. A classical parallel is found in Lucretius,
iv. 1171:

"At lacrimans exclusus amator limina saepe

Floribus et sertis operit postesque superbos

Unguit amaracino" ...

Bttch. here puts to Hitzig the question, "Did the shepherd, the peasant
of Engedi, bring with him oil of myrrh?" Rejecting this reasonable
explanation, he supposes that the Shulamitess, still in Solomon's care,
on rising up quickly dipped her hand in the oil of myrrh, that she might
refresh her beloved. She thus had it near her before her bed, as a sick
person her decoction. The right answer was, that the visitant by night
is not that imaginary personage, but it is Solomon. She had dreamed that
he stood before her door and knocked. But finding no response, he again
in a moment withdrew, when it was proved that Shulamith did not requite
his love and come forth to meet it in its fulness as she ought.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 5:6</span></span>

6 I opened to my beloved;

And my beloved had withdrawn, was gone:

My soul departed when he spake -

I sought him, and found him not;

I called him, and he answered me not.

As the disciples at Emmaus, when the Lord had vanished from the midst of
them, said to one another: Did not our heart burn within us when He
spake with us? so Shulamith says that when he spake, i.e., sought
admission to her, she was filled with alarm, and almost terrified to
death.

Love-ecstasy (ἐκστῆναι, as contrast to γενέσθαι ἐν ἑαυτῷ) is not here
understood, for in such a state she would have flown to meet him; but a
sinking of the soul, such as is described by Terence (And. I 5. 16):

"Oratio haec me miseram exanimavit metu."

The voice of her beloved struck her heart; but in the consciousness that
she had estranged herself from him, she could not openly meet him and
offer empty excuses. But now she recognises it with sorrow that she had
not replied to the deep impression of his loving words; and seeing him
disappear without finding him, she calls after him whom she had
slighted, but he answers her not. The words: "My soul departed when he
spake," are the reason why she now sought him and called upon him, and
they are not a supplementary remark (Zckl.); nor is there need for the
correction of the text בּדברו, which should mean: (my soul departed)
when he turned his back (Ewald), or, behind him (Hitz., Bttch.), from
דּבר = (Arab.) dabara, tergum vertere, praeterire, - the Heb. has the
word דּביר, the hinder part, and as it appears, דּבּר, to act from
behind (treacherously) and destroy, [Ch2
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010.md); cf. under [Gen
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#013.md), but not the Kal דּבר, in that
Arab. signification. The meaning of חמק has been hit upon by Aquila
(ἔκλινεν), Symmachus (ἀπονεύσας), and Jerome (declinaverat); it
signifies to turn aside, to take a different direction, as the Hithpa.
[Jer 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#022.md) : to turn oneself away; cf.
חמּוּקים, turnings, bendings, [Sol
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#002.md). חבק and אבק (cf. [Gen
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#025).md), Aethiop. ḥaḳafa, Amhar. aḳafa
(reminding us of נקץ, Hiph. הקּיף), are usually compared; all of these,
however, signify to "encompass;" but חמק does not denote a moving in a
circle after something, but a half circular motion away from something;
so that in the Arab. the prevailing reference to fools, aḥamḳ, does not
appear to proceed from the idea of closeness, but of the oblique
direction, pushed sideways. Turning himself away, he proceeded farther.
In vain she sought him; she called without receiving any answer. ענני is
the correct pausal form of ענני, vid., under [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md). But something worse than even
this seeking and calling in vain happened to her.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#007.md)

7 The watchmen who go about in the city found me,

They beat me, wounded me;

My upper garment took away from me,

The watchmen of the walls.

She sought her beloved, not "in the midbar" (open field), nor "in the
kepharim" (villages), but בעיר, "in the city," - a circumstance which is
fatal to the shepherd-hypothesis here, as in the other dream. There in
the city she is found by the watchmen who patrol the city, and have
their proper posts on the walls to watch those who approach the city and
depart from it (cf. [Isa 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006).md). These
rough, regardless men, - her story returns at the close like a
palindrome to those previously named, - who judge only according to that
which is external, and have neither an eye nor a heart for the sorrow of
a loving soul, struck (הכה, from נכה, to pierce, hit, strike) and
wounded (פּצע, R. פץ, to divide, to inflict wounds in the flesh) the
royal spouse as a common woman, and so treated her, that, in order to
escape being made a prisoner, she was constrained to leave her upper
robe in their hands ([Gen 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#012).md). This
upper robe, not the veil which at [Sol
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md), [Sol
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003.md) we found was called tsammā, is
called רדיד. Aben Ezra compares with it the Arab. ridâ, a plaid-like
over-garment, which was thrown over the shoulders and veiled the upper
parts of the body. But the words have not the same derivation. The ridâ
has its name from its reaching downward, - probably from the
circumstance that, originally, it hung down to the feet, so that one
could tread on it; but the (Heb.) redid (in Syr. the dalmatica of the
deacons), from רדד, Hiph., [Kg1 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#032.md),
Targ., Talm., Syr., רדד, to make broad and thin, as expansum, i.e., a
thin and light upper robe, viz., over the cuttoněth, 3a. The lxx
suitably translates it here and at [Gen
24:65](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#065.md) (hatstsaiph, from tsa'aph, to
lay together, to fold, to make double or many-fold) by θέριστρον, a
summer overdress. A modern painter, who represents Shulamith as stripped
naked by the watchmen, follows his own sensual taste, without being able
to distinguish between tunica and pallium; for neither Luther, who
renders by schleier (veil), nor Jerome, who has pallium (cf. the saying
of Plautus: tunica propior pallio est), gives any countenance to such a
freak of imagination. The city watchmen tore from off her the upper
garment, without knowing and without caring to know what might be the
motive and the aim of this her nocturnal walk.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 5:8</span></span>

All this Shulamith dreamed; but the painful feeling of repentance, of
separation and misapprehension, which the dream left behind, entered as
deeply into her soul as if it had been an actual external experience.
Therefore she besought the daughters of Jerusalem:

8 I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem,

If ye find my beloved, -

What shall ye then say to him?

"That I am sick of love."

That אם is here not to be interpreted as the negative particle of
adjuration (Bttch.), as at [Sol 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007.md);
[Sol 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#005.md), at once appears from the
absurdity arising from such an interpretation. The or. directa,
following "I adjure you," can also begin ([Num
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#019)..md) with the usual אם, which is
followed by its conclusion. Instead of "that ye say to him I am sick of
love," she asks the question: What shall ye say to him: and adds the
answer: quod aegra sum amore, or, as Jerome rightly renders, in
conformity with the root-idea of חלה: quia amore langueo; while, on the
other hand, the lxx: ὃτι τετροομένη (saucia) ἀγάπης ἐγώ εἰμι, as if the
word were חללת, from חלל. The question proposed, with its answer,
inculcates in a naive manner that which is to be said, as one examines
beforehand a child who has to order something. She turns to the
daughters of Jerusalem, because she can presuppose in them, in contrast
with those cruel watchmen, a sympathy with her love-sorrow, on the
ground of their having had similar experiences. They were also witnesses
of the origin of this covenant of love, and graced the marriage festival
by their sympathetic love.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 5:9</span></span>

When, therefore, they put to her the question:

9 What is thy beloved before another (beloved),

Thou fairest of women?

What is thy beloved before another (beloved),

That thou dost adjure us thus?

the question thus asked cannot proceed from ignorance; it can only have
the object of giving them the opportunity of hearing from Shulamith's
own mouth and heart her laudatory description of him, whom they also
loved, although they were not deemed worthy to stand so near to him as
she did who was thus questioned. Bttch. and Ewald, secs. 325a, 326a,
interpret the מן in מדּור partitively: quid amati (as in Cicero: quod
hominis) amatus tuus; but then the words would have been מה־מדוד דודך,
if such a phrase were admissible; for מה־דוד certainly of itself alone
means quid amati, what kind of a beloved. Thus the מן is the comparative
(prae amato), and דּוד the sing., representing the idea of species or
kind; מדּודים, here easily misunderstood, is purposely avoided. The use
of the form השׁבעתנו for השׁבעתּינו is one of the many instances of the
disregard of the generic distinction occurring in this Song, which
purposely, after the manner of the vulgar language, ignores pedantic
regularity.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 5:10</span></span>

Hereupon Shulamith describes to them who ask what her beloved is. He is
the fairest of men. Everything that is glorious in the kingdom of
nature, and, so far as her look extends, everything in the sphere of
art, she appropriates, so as to present a picture of his external
appearance. Whatever is precious, lovely, and grand, is all combined in
the living beauty of his person.

(Note: Hengstenberg finds in this eulogium, on the supposition that
Solomon is the author, and is the person who is here described,
incomprehensible self-praise. But he does not certainly say all this
immediately of himself, but puts it into the mouth of Shulamith, whose
love he gained. But love idealizes; she sees him whom she loves, not as
others see him, - she sees him in her own transforming light.)

She first praises the mingling of colours in the countenance of her
beloved.

10 My beloved is dazzling white and ruddy,

Distinguised above ten thousand.

The verbal root צח has the primary idea of purity, i.e., freedom from
disturbance and muddiness, which, in the stems springing from it, and in
their manifold uses, is transferred to undisturbed health (Arab. ṣaḥḥ,
cf. baria, of smoothness of the skin), a temperate stomach and clear
head, but particularly to the clearness and sunny brightness of the
heavens, to dazzling whiteness (צחח, [Lam
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007); cf. צחר.md), and then to parched
dryness, resulting from the intense and continued rays of the sun; צח is
here adj. from צחח, [Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md), bearing
almost the same relation to לבן as λαμπρός to λευκός, cogn. with lucere.
אדום, R. דם, to condense, is properly dark-red, called by the Turks kuju
kirmesi (from kuju, thick, close, dark), by the French rouge fonc, of
the same root as דּם, the name for blood, or a thick and dark fluid.
White, and indeed a dazzling white, is the colour of his flesh, and
redness, deep redness, the colour of his blood tinging his flesh.
Whiteness among all the race-colours is the one which best accords with
the dignity of man; pure delicate whiteness is among the Caucasian races
a mark of high rank, of superior training, of hereditary nobility;
wherefore, [Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md), the appearance of
the nobles of Jerusalem is likened in whiteness to snow and milk, in
redness to corals; and Homer, Il. iv. 141, says of Menelaus that he
appeared stained with gore, "as when some woman tinges ivory with purple
colour." In this mingling of white and red, this fulness of life and
beauty, he is דּגוּל, distinguished above myriads. The old translators
render dagul by "chosen" (Aquila, Symm., Syr., Jerome, Luther), the lxx
by ἐκλελοχισμένος, e cohorte selectus; but it means "bannered" (degel,
[Sol 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#004).md), as the Venet.:
σεσημαιωμένος, i.e., thus distinguished, as that which is furnished with
a degel, a banner, a pennon. Grtz takes dagul as the Greek σημειωτός
(noted). With רבבן, as a designation of an inconceivable number, Rashi
rightly compares [Eze 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#007.md). Since the
"ten thousand" are here though of, not in the same manner as דגולים, the
particle min is not the compar. magis quam, but, as at [Gen
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014.md); [Jdg
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024.md); [Isa
52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014.md), prae, making conspicuous (cf.
Virgil, Aen. v. 435, prae omnibus unum). After this praise of the bright
blooming countenance, which in general distinguished the personal
appearance of her beloved, so far as it was directly visible, there now
follows a detailed description, beginning with his head.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 5:11</span></span>

11 His head is precious fine gold,

His locks hill upon hill,

Black as the raven.

The word-connection פּז כּתם, occurring only here, serves as a
designation of the very finest pure gold; for כּתם (hiding, then that
which is hidden), from כתם, R. כת (vid., concerning the words
appertaining to this root, under [Psa
87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006).md), is the name of fine gold, which
was guarded as a jewel (cf. [Pro
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#012)), and פּז (with long ā.md), is pure
gold freed from inferior metals, from פּזז, to set free, and generally
violently to free (cf. zahav muphaz, [Kg1
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018.md), with zahav tahor, [Ch2
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#017).md). The Targ. to the Hagiog.
translate פז by אובריזא (e.g., [Psa
119:127](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#127).md), or אובריזין (e.g., [Psa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011).md), ὄβρυζον, i.e., gold which has
stood the fire-proof (obrussa) of the cupel or the crucible.
Grammatically regarded, the word-connection kethem paz is not genit.,
like kethem ophir, but appositional, like narrah bethulah, [Deu
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#028.md), zevahim shelamim, [Exo
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md), etc. The point of comparison is
the imposing nobility of the fine form and noble carriage of his head.
In the description of the locks of his hair the lxx render תלתלים by
ἐλάται, Jerome by sicut elatae palmarum, like the young twigs, the young
shoots of the palm. Ewald regards it as a harder parall. form of
זלזלּים, [Isa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005.md), vine-branches; and
Hitzig compares the Thousand and One Nights, iii. 180, where the loose
hair of a maiden is likened to twisted clusters of grapes. The
possibility of this meaning is indisputable, although (Arab.) taltalat,
a drinking-vessel made of the inner bark of palm-branches, is named, not
from taltalah, as the name of the palm-branch, but from taltala, to
shake down, viz., in the throat. The palm-branch, or the vine-branch,
would be named from תּלתּל, pendulum esse, to hang loosely and with a
wavering motion, the freq. of תּלה, pendere. The Syr. also think on תלה,
for it translates "spread out," i.e., a waving downward; and the Venet.,
which translates by ἀπαιωρήματα. The point of comparison would be the
freshness and flexibility of the abundant long hair of the head, in
contrast to motionless close-lying smoothness. One may think of Jupiter,
who, when he shakes his head, moves heaven and earth. But, as against
this, we have the fact: (1) That the language has other names for
palm-branches and vine-branches; the former are called in the [Sol
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009), sansinnim. (2.md) That תלתלים,
immediately referred to the hair, but not in the sense of "hanging
locks" (Bttch.), is still in use in the post-bibl. Heb. (vid., under
[Sol 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002).md); the Targ. also, in
translating דּגוּרין דּגורין, cumuli cumuli, thinks תלתלים = תּלּין
תּלּין, Menachoth 29b. A hill is called תל, (Arab.) tall, from טלל,
prosternere, to throw along, as of earth thrown out, sand, or rubbish;
and תּלתּל, after the form גּלגּל, in use probably only in the plur., is
a hilly country which rises like steps, or presents an undulating
appearance. Seen fro his neck upwards, his hair forms in undulating
lines, hill upon hill. In colour, these locks of hair are black as a
raven, which bears the Semitic name עורב from its blackness (ערב), but
in India is called kârava from its croaking. The raven-blackness of the
hair contrasts with the whiteness and redness of the countenance, which
shines forth as from a dark ground, from a black border. The eyes are
next described.

12 His eyes like doves by the water-brooks,

Bathing in milk, stones beautifully set

The eyes in their glancing moistness (cf. ὑγρότης τῶν ὀμμάτων, in
Plutarch, of a languishing look), and in the movement of their pupils,
are like doves which sip at the water-brooks, and move to and fro beside
them. אפיק, from אפק, continere, is a watercourse, and then also the
water itself flowing in it (vid., under [Psa
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016)), as (Arab..md) wadin, a valley,
and then the river flowing in the valley, bahr, the sea-basin (properly
the cleft), and then also the sea itself. The pred. "bathing" refers to
the eyes (cf. [Sol 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009).md), not to the
doves, if this figure is continued. The pupils of the eyes, thus
compared with doves, seem as if bathing in milk, in that they swim, as
it were, in the white in the eye. But it is a question whether the
figure of the doves is continued also in ישׁבות על־מלּאת. It would be
the case of milleth meant "fulness of water," as it is understood, after
the example of the lxx, also by Aquila (ἐκχύσεις). Jerome (fluenta
plenissima), and the Arab. (piscinas aqua refertas); among the moderns,
by Dpke, Gesen., Hengst., and others. But this pred. would then bring
nothing new to [Sol 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#012.md); and although
in the Syr. derivatives from melā' signify flood and high waters, yet
the form milleth does not seem, especially without מים, to be capable of
bearing this signification. Luther's translation also, although in
substance correct: und stehen in der flle (and stand in fulness)
(milleth, like שׁלמותא of the Syr., πληρώσεως of the Gr. Venet., still
defended by Hitz.), yet does not bring out the full force of milleth,
which, after the analogy of כּסּא, רצפה, appears to have a concrete
signification which is seen from a comparison of [Exo
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#007.md); [Exo
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#017.md), [Exo
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020.md); [Exo
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#013.md). There מלּאה and מלּאים signify
not the border with precious stones, but, as rightly maintained by Keil,
against Knobel, their filling in, i.e., their bordering, setting.
Accordingly, milleth will be a synon. technical expression: the
description, passing from the figure of the dove, says further of the
eyes, that they are firm on (in) their setting; על is suitable, for the
precious stone is laid within the casket in which it is contained.
Hitzig has, on the contrary, objected that מלאת and מלאים denote filling
up, and thus that milleth cannot be a filling up, and still less the
place thereof. But as in the Talm. מוּליתא signifies not only fulness,
but also stuffed fowls or pies, and as πλήρωμα in its manifold aspects
is used not only of that with which anything is filled, but also of that
which is filled (e.g., of a ship that is manned, and [Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md) of the church in which Christ, as
in His body, is immanent), - thus also milleth, like the German
"Fassung," may be used of a ring-casket (funda or pala) in which the
precious stone is put. That the eyes are like a precious stone in its
casket, does not merely signify that they fill the sockets, - for the
bulbus of the eye in every one fills the orbita, - but that they are not
sunk like the eyes of one who is sick, which fall back on their
supporting edges in the orbita, and that they appear full and large as
they press forward from wide and open eyelids. The cheeks are next
described.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 5:13</span></span>

13a His cheeks like a bed of sweet herbs,

Towers of spicy plants.

A flower-bed is called ערוּגה, from ערג, to be oblique, inclined. His
cheeks are like such a soft raised bed, and the impression their
appearance makes is like the fragrance which flows from such a bed
planted with sweet-scented flowers. Migedaloth are the tower-like or
pyramidal mounds, and merkahhim are the plants used in spicery. The
point of comparison here is thus the soft elevation; perhaps with
reference to the mingling of colours, but the word chosen (merkahhim)
rather refers to the lovely, attractive, heart-refreshing character of
the impression. The Venet., keeping close to the existing text: αἱ
σιαγόνες αὐτοῦ ὡς πρασιὰ τοῦ ἀρώματος πύργοι ἀρωματισμῶν (thus not
a̓ρωματιστῶν\] according to Gebhardt's just conjecture). But is the
punctuation here correct? The sing. כערוגת is explained from this, that
the bed is presented as sloping from its height downward on two parallel
sides; but the height would then be the nose dividing the face, and the
plur. would thus be more suitable; and the lxx, Symm., and other ancient
translators have, in fact, read כערוגת. But still less is the phrase
migdeloth merkahhim to be comprehended; for a tower, however diminutive
it may be, it not a proper figure for a soft elevation, nor even a
graduated flowery walk, or a terraced flowery hill, - a tower always
presents, however round one may conceive it, too much the idea of a
natural chubbiness, or of a diseased tumour. Therefore the expression
used by the lxx, φύουσαι μυρεψικά, i.e., מרק' מהדּלות, commends itself.
Thus also Jerome: sicut areolae aromatum consitae a pigmentariis, and
the Targ. (which refers לחיים allegorically to the לוּחי of the law, and
merkahhim to the refinements of the Halacha): "like the rows of a garden
of aromatic plants which produce (gignentes) deep, penetrating sciences,
even as a (magnificent) garden, aromatic plants." Since we read מגדּלות
כערוגת, we do not refer migadloth, as Hitzig, who retains כערוגת, to the
cheeks, although their name, like that of the other members (e.g., the
ear, hand, foot), may be fem. (Bttch. 649), but to the beds of spices;
but in this carrying forward of the figure we find, as he does, a
reference to the beard and down on the cheeks. גּדּל is used of
suffering the hair to grow, [Num 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#005.md),
as well as of cultivating plants; and it is a similar figure when
Pindar, Nem. v. 11, compares the milk-hair of a young man to the fine
woolly down of the expanding vine-leaves (vid., Passow). In merkahhim
there scarcely lies anything further than that this flos juventae on the
blooming cheeks gives the impression of the young shoots of aromatic
plants; at all events, the merkahhim, even although we refer this
feature in the figure to the fragrance of the unguents on the beard, are
not the perfumes themselves, to which megadloth is not appropriate, but
fragrant plants, so that in the first instance the growth of the beard
is in view with the impression of its natural beauty.

13b His lips lilies,

Dropping with liquid myrrh.

Lilies, viz., red lilies (vid., under [Sol
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001).md), unless the point of comparison
is merely loveliness associated with dignity. She thinks of the lips as
speaking. All that comes forth from them, the breath in itself, and the
breath formed into words, is עבר מור, most precious myrrh, viz., such as
of itself wells forth from the bark of the balsamodendron. עבר, the
running over of the eyes (cf. myrrha in lacrimis, the most highly
esteemed sort, as distinguished from myrrha in granis), with which
Dillmann combines the Aethiop. name for myrrh, karbê (vid., under Song
\_[Num 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#005).md).

14a His hands golden cylinders,

Filled in with stones of Tarshish.

The figure, according to Gesen., Heb. Wrterbuch, and literally also
Heilgst., is derived from the closed hand, and the stained nails are
compared to precious stones. both statements are incorrect; for (1)
although it is true that then Israelitish women, as at the present day
Egyptian and Arabian women, stained their eyes with stibium (vid., under
[Isa 54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011).md), yet it is nowhere shown
that they, and particularly men, stained the nails of their feet and
their toes with the orange-yellow of the Alhenna (Lane's Egypt, I
33-35); and (2) the word used is not כּפּיו, but ידיו; it is thus the
outstretched hands that are meant; and only these, not the closed fist,
could be compared to "lilies," for גּליל signifies not a ring (Cocc.,
Dpke, Bttch., etc.), but that which is rolled up, a roller, cylinder
([Est 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#006).md), from גּלל, which properly
means not κυκλοῦν (Venet., after Gebhardt: κεκυκλωμέναι), but κυλίνδειν.
The hands thus are meant in respect of the fingers, which on account of
their noble and fine form, their full, round, fleshy mould, are compared
to bars of gold formed like rollers, garnished (ממלּאים, like מלּא, [Exo
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#017).md) with stones of Tarshish, to
which the nails are likened. The transparent horn-plates of the nails,
with the lunula, the white segment of a circle at their roots, are
certainly, when they are beautiful, an ornament to the hand, and,
without our needing to think of their being stained, are worthily
compared to the gold-yellow topaz. Tarshish is not the onyx, which
derives its Heb. name שׁהם from its likeness to the finger-nail, but the
χρυσόλιθος, by which the word in this passage before us is translated by
the Quinta and the Sexta, and elsewhere also by the lxx and Aquila. But
the chrysolite is the precious stone which is now called the topaz. It
receives the name Tarshish from Spain, the place where it was found.
Pliny, xxxviii. 42, describes it as aureo fulgore tralucens. Bredow
erroneously interprets Tarshish of amber. There is a kind of chrysolite,
indeed, which is called chryselectron, because in colorem electri
declinans. The comparison of the nails to such a precious stone (Luther,
influenced by the consonance, and apparently warranted by the plena
hyacinthis of the Vulg., has substituted golden rings, vol Trkissen,
whose blue-green colour is not suitable here), in spite of Hengst., who
finds it insipid, is as true to nature as it is tender and pleasing. The
description now proceeds from the uncovered to the covered parts of his
body, the whiteness of which is compared to ivory and marble.

14b His body an ivory work of art,

Covered with sapphires.

The plur. מעים or מעים, from מעה or מעי (vid., under [Psa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009).md), signifies properly the tender
parts, and that the inward parts of the body, but is here, like the
Chald. מעין, [Dan 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#032.md), and the בּטן,
[Sol 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003.md), which also properly
signifies the inner part of the body, κοιλία, transferred to the body in
its outward appearance. To the question how Shulamith should in such a
manner praise that which is for the most part covered with clothing, it
is not only to be answered that it is the poet who speaks by her mouth,
but also that it is not the bride or the beloved, but the wife, whom he
represents as thus speaking. עשׁת (from the peculiar Hebraeo-Chald. and
Targ. עשׁת, which, after [Jer 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md),
like ḳhalak, creare, appears to proceed from the fundamental idea of
smoothing) designates an artistic figure. Such a figure was Solomon's
throne, made of שׁן, the teeth of elephants, ivory,

(Note: Ivory is fully designated by the name שׁנהבּים, Lat. ebur, from
the Aegypt. ebu, the Aegypto-Indian ibha, elephant.)

[Kg1 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018.md). Here Solomon's own person,
without reference to a definite admired work of art, is praised as being
like an artistic figure made of ivory, - like it in regard to its
glancing smoothness and its fine symmetrical form. When, now, this word
of art is described as covered with sapphires (מעלּפת, referred to עשׁת,
as apparently gramm., or as ideal, fem.), a sapphire-coloured robe is
not meant (Hitzig, Ginsburg); for עלף, which only means to disguise,
would not at all be used of such a robe ([Gen
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014.md); cf. [Gen
24:65](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#065).md), nor would the one uniform
colour of the robe be designated by sapphires in the plur. The choice of
the verb עלף (elsewhere used of veiling) indicates a covering shading
the pure white, and in connection with ספּירים, thought of as accus., a
moderating of the bright glance by a soft blue. For ספיר (a genuine
Semit. word, like the Chald. שׁפּיר; cf. regarding ספר = שׁפר, under
[Psa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006).md) is the sky-blue sapphire
([Exo 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010).md), including the Lasurstein
(lapis lazuli), sprinkled with golden, or rather with gold-like
glistening points of pyrites, from which, with the l omitted, sky-blue
is called azur (azure) (vid., under [Job
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#006).md). The word of art formed of ivory
is quite covered over with sapphires fixed in it. That which is here
compared is nothing else than the branching blue veins under the white
skin.

15a His legs white marble columns,

Set on bases of fine gold.

If the beauty of the living must be represented, not by colours, but in
figurative language, this cannot otherwise be done than by the selection
of minerals, plants, and things in general for the comparison, and the
comparison must more or less come short, because dead soulless matter
does not reach to a just and full representation of the living. Thus
here, also, the description of the lower extremity, which reaches from
the thighs and the legs down to the feet, of which last, in the words of
an anatomist,

(Note: Hyrtl's Lehrbuch der Anat. des Menschen, sec. 155.)

it may be said that "they form the pedestal for the bony pillars of the
legs." The comparison is thus in accordance with fact; the שׁוקים (from
שוק = Arab. saḳ, to drive: the movers forward), in the structure of the
human frame, take in reality the place of "pillars," and the feet the
place of "pedestals," as in the tabernacle the wooden pillars rested on
small supports in which they were fastened, [Exo
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#018.md). But in point of fidelity to
nature, the symbol is inferior to a rigid Egyptian figure. Not only is
it without life; it is not even capable of expressing the curvilinear
shape which belongs to the living. On the other hand, it loses itself in
symbol; for although it is in conformity with nature that the legs are
compared to pillars of white (according to Aquila and Theod., Parian)
marble, - שׁשׁ = שׁישׁ, [Ch1 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002.md)
(material for the building of the temple), Talm. מרמרא, of the same
verbal root as שׁוּשׁן, the name of the white lily, - the comparison of
the feet to bases of fine gold is yet purely symbolical. Gold is a
figure of that which is sublime and noble, and with white marble
represents greatness combined with purity. He who is here praised is not
a shepherd, but a king. The comparisons are thus so grand because the
beauty of the beloved is in itself heightened by his kingly dignity.

(Note: Dillmann proposes the question, the answer to which he
desiderates in Ewald, how the maiden could be so fluent in speaking of
the new glories of the Solomonic era (plants and productions of art).
Bttcher answers, that she had learned to know these whilst detained at
court, and that the whole description has this ground-thought, that she
possessed in her beloved all the splendour which the women of the harem
value and enjoy. But already the first words of the description, "white
and ruddy," exclude the sunburnt shepherd. To refer the gold, in the
figurative description of the uncovered parts of the body, to this
bronze colour is insipid.)

15b His aspect like Lebanon,

Distinguised as the cedars.

By בּחוּר the Chald. thinks of "a young man" (from בּחר = בּגר, to be
matured, as at [Psa 89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020).md); but in
that case we should have expected the word כּארז instead of כּארזים.
Luther, with all other translators, rightly renders "chosen as the
cedars." His look, i.e., his appearance as a whole, is awe-inspiring,
majestic, like Lebanon, the king of mountains; he (the praised one) is
chosen, i.e., presents a rare aspect, rising high above the common man,
like the cedars, those kings among trees, which as special witnesses of
creative omnipotence are called "cedars of God," [Psa
80:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#011.md) \[10\]. בּחוּר, electus,
everywhere else an attribute of persons, does not here refer to the
look, but to him whose the look is; and what it means in union with the
cedars is seen from [Jer 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#007.md); cf.
[Isa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024.md). Here also it is seen (what
besides is manifest), that the fairest of the children of men is a king.
In conclusion, the description returns from elevation of rank to
loveliness.

16a His palate is sweets (sweetnesses),

And he is altogether precious (lovelinesses).

The palate, חך, is frequently named as the organ of speech, [Job
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#030.md); [Job
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#030.md); [Pro
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md); [Pro
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#007.md); and it is also here used in this
sense. The meaning, "the mouth for kissing," which Bttch. gives to the
word, is fanciful; חך (= ḥnk, Arab. ḥanak) is the inner palate and the
region of the throat, with the uvula underneath the chin. Partly with
reference to his words, his lips have been already praised, 13b; but
there the fragrance of his breath came into consideration, his breath
both in itself and as serving for the formation of articulate words. But
the naming of the palate can point to nothing else than his words. With
this the description comes to a conclusion; for, from the speech, the
most distinct and immediate expression of the personality, advance is
made finally to the praise of the person. The pluraliatant. ממתּקּים and
מחמדּים designate what they mention in richest fulness. His palate,
i.e., that which he speaks and the manner in which he speaks it, is true
sweetness (cf. [Pro 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#021.md); [Psa
55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015).md), and his whole being true
loveliness. With justifiable pride Shulamith next says:

16b This is my beloved and this my friend,

Ye daughters of Jerusalem!

The emphatically repeated "this" is here pred. (Luth. "such an one is"
...); on the other hand, it is subj. at [Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015) (Luth.: "that is" ....md).
