<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 4:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>He now confirms and explains the command to duty which he has placed at the beginning of the whole (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008">Pro 1:8</A>). This he does by his own example, for he relates from the history of his own youth, to the circle of disciples by whom he sees himself surrounded, what good doctrine his parents had taught him regarding the way of life:
<p>1 Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father,
<p>   And attend that ye may gain understanding;
<p>2 For I give to you good doctrine,
<p>   Forsake not my direction!
<p>3 For I was a son to my father,
<p>   A tender and only (son) in the sight of my mother.
<p>4 And he instructed me, and said to me:
<p>   "Let thine heart hold fast my words:
<p>   Observe my commandments and live!"
<p>That &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in the address comes here into the place of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, hitherto used, externally denotes that &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; in the progress of these discourses finds another application: the poet himself is so addressed by his father. Intentionally he does not say &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008">Pro 1:8</A>): he does not mean the father of each individual among those addressed, but himself, who is a father in his relation to them as his disciples; and as he manifests towards them fatherly love, so also he can lay claim to paternal authority over them. &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; is rightly vocalized, not &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;. The words do not give the object of attention, but the design, the aim. The combination of ideas in &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002">Pro 1:2</A>), which appears to us singular, loses its strangeness when we remember that &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; means, according to its etymon, deposition or reception into the conscience and life. Regarding &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;, apprehension, reception, lesson = doctrine, vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005">Pro 1:5</A>. &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is the perf., which denotes as fixed and finished what is just now being done, Gesenius, 126, 4. &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; is here synonym of &#1504;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008">Pro 1:8</A>, and the contrary of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#004">Pro 28:4</A>. The relative factum in the perfect, designating the circumstances under which the event happened, regularly precedes the chief factum &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;; see under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002">Gen 1:2</A>. Superficially understood, the expression 3a would be a platitude; the author means that the natural legal relation was also confirming itself as a moral one. It was a relation of many-sided love, according to 3a: he was esteemed of his mother - &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, used of the reflex in the judgment, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#009">Gen 10:9</A>, and of loving care, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#018">Gen 17:18</A>, means this - as a tender child, and therefore tenderly to be protected (&#1512;&#1498; as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#013">Gen 33:13</A>), and as an only child, whether he were so in reality, or was only loved as if he were so. &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491; (Aq., Sym., Theod., &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;) may with reference to number also mean unice dilectus (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;); cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002">Gen 22:2</A>, &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498; (where the lxx translate &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, without therefore having &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498; before them). &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is maintained by all the versions; &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is not a variant.
<p>(Note: In some editions &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is noted as Ker&#305;&#770; to &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, but erroneously and contrary to the express evidence of the Masora, which affirms that there are two passages in which we ought to read not &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, but &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, viz., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#003">Psa 80:3</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003">Pro 4:3</A>.)
<p>The instruction of the father begins with the jussive, which is pointed &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1498;&#1470;
<p>(Note: The writing of -&#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1498; with the grave Metheg (Gaja) and Kametz-Chatuph (o&#780;) is that of Ben Asher; on the other hand, &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1498;&#1470; with Cholem (o&#772;) and the permanent Metheg is that of Ben Naphtali; vid., Michlol 21a [under the verbal form 25], 30.)
<p>to distinguish it from &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1498;&#1470; on account of the o&#780;. The lxx has incorrectly &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;, as if the word were &#1497;&#1505;&#1502;&#1498;; Symmachus has correctly &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;. The imper. &#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; is, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#002">Pro 7:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007">Gen 20:7</A>, more than &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;; the teacher seeks, along with the means, at the same time their object: Observe my commandments, and so become a partaker of life! The Syriac, however, adds &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; and my instruction as the apple of thine eye, a clause borrowed from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#002">Pro 7:2</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#005">Proverbs 4:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 4:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The exhortation of the father now specializes itself:
<p>5 Get wisdom, get understanding;
<p>   Forget not and turn not from the words of my mouth.
<p>6 Forsake her not, so shall she preserve thee;
<p>   Love her, so shall she keep thee.
<p>Wisdom and understanding are (5a) thought of as objects of merchandise (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#023">Pro 23:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014">Pro 3:14</A>), like the one pearl of great price, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#046">Mat 13:46</A>, and the words of fatherly instruction (5b), accordingly, as offering this precious possession, or helping to the acquisition of it. One cannot indeed say correctly &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495; &#1502;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1508;&#1497;, but &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1508;&#1497; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005">Psa 102:5</A>); and in this sense &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495; goes before, or also the accus. object, which in &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1513;&#1499;&#1495; the author has in his mind, may, since he continues with &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1496;, now not any longer find expression as such. That the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1508;&#1497; are the means of acquiring wisdom is shown in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#006">Pro 4:6</A>, where this continues to be the primary idea. The verse, consisting of only four words, ought to be divided by Mugrash;
<p>(Note: According to correct readings in codd. and older editions, &#1493;&#1514;&#1513;&#1502;&#1512;&#1498;&#1468; has also indeed Rebia Mugrash, and &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492;, Mercha (with Zinnorith); vid., Torath Emeth, p. 47, 6; Accentuationssystem, xviii. 1, 2; and regarding the Zinnorith, see Liber Psalmorum Hebraicus by S. Baer, p. xii.)
<p>the Vav (&#1493;) in both halves of the verse introduces the apodosis imperativi (cf. e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009">Pro 3:9</A>., and the apodosis prohibitivi, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021">Pro 3:21</A>.). The actual representation of wisdom, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#005">Pro 4:5</A>, becomes in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#006">Pro 4:6</A> personal. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#007">Proverbs 4:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">pro 4:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Referring to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#005">Pro 4:5</A>, the father further explains that wisdom begins with the striving after it, and that this striving is itself its fundamental beginning:
<p>7 The beginning of wisdom is "Get wisdom,"
<p>   And with [um, at the price of] all thou hast gotten get understanding,
<p>8 Esteem her, so shall she lift thee up;
<p>   She will bring thee honour if thou dost embrace her.
<p>9 She will put on thine head a graceful garland,
<p>   She will bestow upon thee a glorious diadem.
<p>In the motto of the book, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007">Pro 1:7</A>, the author would say that the fear of Jahve is that from which all wisdom takes its origin. &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007">Pro 1:7</A>) is the subject, and as such it stands foremost. Here he means to say what the beginning of wisdom consists in. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is the subject, and stands forth as such. The predicate may also be read &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;&#1470;&#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; (= &#1511;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;), after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#016">Pro 16:16</A>. The beginning of wisdom is (consists in) the getting of wisdom; but the imperative &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, which also Aq., Sym., Theod. (&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), Jerome, Syr., Targ. express (the lxx leaves <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#007">Pro 4:7</A> untranslated), is supported by 7b. Hitzig, after Mercier, De Dieu, and Dderlein, translates the verse thus: "the highest thing is wisdom; get wisdom," which Zckler approves of; but the reasons which determine him to this rendering are subtleties: if the author had wished himself to be so understood, he ought at least to have written the words &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;. But &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is a genitive of relation, as is to be expected from the relativity of the idea &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, and his intention is to say that the beginning of wisdom consists in the proposition &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; (cf. the similar formula, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013">Ecc 12:13</A>); this proposition is truly the lapis philosophorum, it contains all that is necessary in order to becoming wise. Therefore the Greek &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; called itself modestly &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; for &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; the Book of Wisdom has, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#018">Pro 6:18</A>, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. In 7b the proposition is expressed which contains the specificum helping to wisdom. The &#1489;&#1468; denotes price: give all for wisdom (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#046">Mat 13:46</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044">Mat 13:44</A>); no price is too high, no sacrifice too great for it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#008">Proverbs 4:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 4:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The meaning of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. &#1505;&#1500;&#1505;&#1500; is determined by &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; in the parallel clause; &#1505;&#1500;&#1500; signifies to raise, exalt, as a way or dam by heaping up; the Pilpel, here tropical: to value or estimate highly. Bttcher interprets well: hold it high in price, raise it (as a purchaser) always higher, make offer for it upon offer. The lxx (approved by Bertheau), &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, circumvallate it, i.e., surround it with a wall (&#1505;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492;) - a strange and here unsuitable figure. Hold it high, says the author, and so it will reward
<p>(Note: Lwenstein has rightly &#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1498;, vid., my preface to Baer's Genesis, p. vii.)
<p>thee with a high place, and (with chiastic transposition of the performance and the consequence) she will honour
<p>(Note: We read &#1514;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1498;, not &#1514;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (Hahn) or &#1514;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1498; (Lwenstein); the tone lies on the penult., and the tone-syllable has the point Tsere, as in &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1498;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#007">Deu 32:7</A>; vid., Michlol 66b.)
<p>thee if (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;) thou lovingly embracest her. &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511; is used of embracing in the pressure of tender love, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006">Sol 2:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#003">Sol 8:3</A>; the Piel is related to the Kal as amplexari to amplecti. Wisdom exalts her admirers, honours her lovers, and makes a man's appearance pleasant, causing him to be reverenced when he approaches. Regarding &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1495;&#1503;, vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009">Pro 1:9</A>. &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503;, to deliver up (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#020">Gen 14:20</A>), to give up (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008">Hos 11:8</A>), is connected in the free poetic manner with two accusatives, instead of with an accus. and dat. lxx has &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;, but one does not defend himself (as with a shield) by a wreath or crown. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#010">Proverbs 4:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 4:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>There is no reason for the supposition that the warning which his father gave to the poet now passes over into warnings given by the poet himself (Hitzig); the admonition of the father thus far refers only in general to the endeavour after wisdom, and we are led to expect that the good doctrines which the father communicates to the son as a viaticum will be further expanded, and become more and more specific when they take a new departure.
<p>10 Hearken, my son, and receive my sayings,
<p>     So shall the years of life be increased to thee.
<p>11 In the way of wisdom have I taught thee,
<p>     Guided thee in the paths of rectitude.
<p>12 When thou goest, thy step shall not be straitened;
<p>     And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
<p>Regarding &#1511;&#1495; (of &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;) of appropriating reception and taking up in succum et sanguinem, vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003">Pro 1:3</A>; regarding &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, years not merely of the duration of life, but of the enjoyment of life, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002">Pro 3:2</A>; regarding &#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; (&#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;), path (track), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#009">Pro 2:9</A>; regarding the &#1489;&#1468; of &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, of the department and subject of instruction, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008">Psa 25:8</A>. The perfects, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#011">Pro 4:11</A>, are different from &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, 2a: they refer to rules of life given at an earlier period, which are summarily repeated in this address. The way of wisdom is that which leads to wisdom (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#023">Job 28:23</A>); the paths of rectitude, such as trace out the way which is in accordance with the rule of the good and the right. If the youth holds to this direction, he will not go on in darkness or uncertainty with anxious footsteps; and if in youthful fervour he flies along his course, he will not stumble on any unforeseen obstacle and fall. &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; is as a metaplastic fut. to &#1510;&#1512;&#1512; or &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to be narrow, to straiten, formed as if from &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;. The Targ. after Aruch,
<p>(Note: R. Nathan ben Jechiel, a.d. 1106, who is usually styled by the Jewish writers &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, Auctor Aruch, author of a Talmudical Lexicon.)
<p>&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1513;&#1504;&#1511; &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1498;, thou shalt not need to bind together (constringere) or to hedge up thy way.

<p>The exhortations attracting by means of promises, now become warnings fitted to alarm:
<p>13 Hold fast to instruction, let her not go;
<p>     Keep her, for she is thy life.
<p>14 Into the path of the wicked enter not,
<p>     And walk not in the way of the evil
<p>15 Avoid it, enter not into it;

The verb &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; signifies, like &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be straight, even, fortunate, whence &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; = Arab. yusa&#770;r, happiness, and to step straight out, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#006">Pro 9:6</A>, of which meanings &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; is partly the intensive, as here, partly the causative, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#019">Pro 23:19</A> (elsewhere causative of the meaning, to be happy, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#013">Gen 30:13</A>).

Still less justifiable is the rendering by Schultens, ne vestigia imprimas in via malorum; for the Arab. a&#770;ththr is denom. of ithr, &#1488;&#1514;&#1512;, the primitive verb roots of which, athr, &#1488;&#1514;&#1512; = &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, are lost.

<p>The second &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the reason of their bodily welfare being conditioned by evil-doing. If the poet meant: they live on bread which consists in wickedness, i.e., on wickedness as their bread, then in the parallel sentence he should have used the word &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;; the genitives are meant of the means of acquisition: they live on unrighteous gain, on bread and wine which they procure by wickedness and by all manner of violence or injustice. On the etymon of &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; (Arab. h&#803;amas, durum, asperum, vehementem esse), vid., Schultens; the plur. &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; belongs to a more recent epoch (vid., under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#049">Sa2 22:49</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049">Psa 18:49</A>). The change in the tense represents the idea that they having eaten such bread, set forth such wine, and therewith wash it down.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 4:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The two ways that lie for his choice before the youth, are distinguished from one another as light is from darkness:
<p>18 And the path of the just is like the brightness of the morning light,
<p>     Which shines more and more till the perfect day.
<p>19 The way of the wicked is deep darkness,
<p>     They know not at what they stumble.
<p>The Hebr. style is wont to conceal in its Vav (&#1493;) diverse kinds of logical relations, but the Vav of 18a may suitably stand before 19a, where the discontinuance of this contrast of the two ways is unsuitable. The displacing of a Vav from its right position is not indeed without example (see under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003">Psa 16:3</A>); but since <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#019">Pro 4:19</A> joins itself more easily than <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018">Pro 4:18</A> to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#017">Pro 4:17</A> without missing a particle, thus it is more probable that the two verses are to be transposed, than that the &#1493; of &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1495; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#017">Pro 4:17</A>) is to be prefixed to &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018">Pro 4:18</A>). Sinning, says <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#016">Pro 4:16</A>, has become to the godless as a second nature, so that they cannot sleep without it; they must continually be sinning, adds <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#017">Pro 4:17</A>, for thus and not otherwise do they gain for themselves their daily bread. With reference to this fearful self-perversion to which wickedness has become a necessity and a condition of life, the poet further says that the way of the godless is &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;,
<p>(Note: In good MSS and printed copies the &#1499; has the Pathach, as Kimchi states the rule in Michlol 45a: &#1499;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;, &#1499;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;.)
<p>as deep darkness, as the entire absence of light: it cannot be otherwise than that they fall, but they do not at all know whereat they fall, for they do not at all know wickedness as such, and have no apprehension of the punishment which from an inward necessity it brings along with it; on the contrary, the path of the just is in constantly increasing light - the light of knowledge, and the light of true happiness which is given
<p>(Note: Hitzig inverts the order of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018">Pro 4:18</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#019">Pro 4:19</A>, and connects the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; of 16a immediately with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#019">Pro 4:19</A> (for the way of the wicked...). He moreover regards <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#016">Pro 4:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#017">Pro 4:17</A> as an interpolation, and explains <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#016">Pro 4:16</A> as a gloss transforming the text of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#019">Pro 4:19</A>. "That the wicked commit wickedness," says Hitzig, "is indeed certain (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#014">Sa1 24:14</A>), and the warning of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#015">Pro 4:15</A> ought not to derive its motive from their energy in sinning." But the warning against the way of the wicked is founded not on their energy in sinning, but on their bondage to sin: their sleep, their food and drink - their life both when they sleep and when they wake - is conditioned by sin and is penetrated by sin. This foundation of the warning furnishes what is needed, and is in nothing open to objection. And that in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#016">Pro 4:16</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#019">Pro 4:19</A> &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1497;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1504;&#1490;&#1494;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; seem to be alike, does not prove that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#016">Pro 4:16</A> originated as a parallel text from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#019">Pro 4:19</A> - in the one verse as in the other the thoughts are original.)

<p>used elsewhere than in the Bible, means the morning star (Venus), (Sirach 50:4, Syr.); when used in the Bible it means the early dawn, the light of the rising sun, the morning light, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004">Sa2 23:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001">Isa 62:1</A>, which announces itself in the morning twilight, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#020">Dan 6:20</A>. The light of this morning sunshine is &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, going and shining, i.e., becoming ever brighter. In the connection of &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; it might be a question whether &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; is regarded as gerundive (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#003">Gen 8:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#005">Gen 8:5</A>), or as participle (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005">Sa2 16:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#006">Jer 41:6</A>), or as a participial adjective (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#013">Gen 26:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#024">Jdg 4:24</A>); in the connection of &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, on the contrary, it is unquestionably the gerundive: the partic. denoting the progress joins itself either with the partic., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#011">Jon 1:11</A>, or with the participial adjective, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001">Sa2 3:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#012">Ch2 17:12</A>, or with another adjective formation, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012">Sa2 15:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#004">Est 9:4</A> (where &#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; after &#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500; of other places appears to be intended as an adjective, not after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#010">Sa2 5:10</A> as gerundive).

It is the midday time that is meant, when the clearness of the day has reached its fullest intensity - the point between increasing and decreasing, when, as we are wont to say, the sun stands in the zenith (= Arab. samt, the point of support, i.e., the vertex). Besides <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#028">Mar 4:28</A>, there is no biblical passage which presents like these two a figure of gradual development.

<p>23 Above all other things that are to be guarded, keep thy heart,
<p>     For out from it life has its issues.
<p>24 Put away from thee perverseness of mouth,
<p>     And waywardness of lips put far from thee.
<p>25 Thine eyes should look straight forward,
<p>     And thine eyelids look straight to the end before thee.
<p>26 Make even the path of thy feet,
<p>     And let all thy ways be correct.
<p>27 Turn not aside to the right and to the left;
<p>     Remove thy foot from evil.
<p>Although &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; in itself and in this connection may mean the object to be watchfully avoided (cavendi) (vid., under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#020">Pro 2:20</A>): thus the usage of the language lying before us applies it, yet only as denoting the place of watching or the object observandi; so that it is not to be thus explained, with Raschi and others: before all from which one has to protect himself (ab omni re cavenda), guard thine heart; but: before all that one has to guard (prae omni re custodienda), guard it as the most precious of possessions committed to thy trust. The heart, which according to its etymon denotes that which is substantial (Kernhafte) in man (cf. Arab. lubb, the kernel of the nut or almond), comes here into view not as the physical, but as the intellectual, and specially the ethical centrum.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#024">Pro 4:24</A>
<p>The &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; are the point of a thing, e.g., of a boundary, from which it goes forth, and the linear course proceeding from thence. If thus the author says that the &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; go out from the heart,
<p>(Note: The correct form here is &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, with the Makkeph to &#1499;&#1497;.)
<p>he therewith implies that the life has not only its fountain in the heart, but also that the direction which it takes is determined by the heart. Physically considered, the heart is the receptacle for the blood, in which the soul lives and rules; the pitcher at the blood-fountain which draws it and pours it forth; the chief vessel of the physically self-subsisting blood-life from which it goes forth, and into which it disembogues (Syst. der bib. Psychol. p. 232). What is said of the heart in the lower sense of corporeal vitality, is true in the higher sense of the intellectual soul-life. The Scripture names the heart also as the intellectual soul-centre of man, in its concrete, central unity, its dynamic activity, and its ethical determination on all sides. All the radiations of corporeal and of soul life concentrate there, and again unfold themselves from thence; all that is implied in the Hellenic and Hellenistic words &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;, &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, lies in the word &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; and all whereby &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; (the body) and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; (the spirit, anima) are affected comes in &#1500;&#1489; into the light of consciousness (Id. p. 251). The heart is the instrument of the thinking, willing, perceiving life of the spirit; it is the seat of the knowledge of self, of the knowledge of God, of the knowledge of our relation to God, and also of the law of God impressed on our moral nature; it is the workshop of our individual spiritual and ethical form of life brought about by self-activity - the life in its higher and in its lower sense goes out from it, and receives from it the impulse of the direction which it takes; and how earnestly, therefore, must we feel ourselves admonished, how sacredly bound to preserve the heart in purity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001">Psa 73:1</A>), so that from this spring of life may go forth not mere seeming life and a caricature of life, but a true life well-pleasing to God! How we have to carry into execution this careful guarding of the heart, is shown in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#024">Pro 4:24</A> and the golden rules which follow. Mouth and lips are meant (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#024">Pro 4:24</A>) as instruments of speech, and not of its utterance, but of the speech going forth from them. &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, distorsio, refers to the mouth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012">Pro 6:12</A>), when what it speaks is disfiguring and deforming, thus falsehood as the contrast of truth and love (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012">Pro 2:12</A>); and to the lips &#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, when that which they speak turns aside from the true and the right to side-ways and by-ways. Since the Kametz of such abstracta, as well of verbs '&#1493;'&#1506; like &#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#005">Eze 32:5</A>, as of verbs '&#1492;'&#1500; like &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013">Isa 45:13</A>, &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#018">Isa 28:18</A>, is elsewhere treated as unalterable, there lies in this &#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; either an inconsistency of punctuation, or it is presupposed that the form &#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; was vocalized like &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; = &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029">Num 21:29</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#025">Pro 4:25</A>
<p>Another rule commends gathering together (concentration) in opposition to dissipation. It is also even externally regarded worthy of consideration, as Ben-Sira, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005">Pro 9:5</A>, expresses it: &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; - purposeless, curious staring about operates upon the soul, always decentralizing and easily defiling it. But the rule does not exhaust itself in this meaning with reference to external self-discipline; it counsels also straight-forward, unswerving directness toward a fixed goal (and what else can this be in such a connection than that which wisdom places before man?), without the turning aside of the eye toward that which is profitless and forbidden, and in this inward sense it falls in with the demand for a single, not squinting eye, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022">Mat 6:22</A>, where Bengel explains &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; by simplex et bonus, intentus in caelum, in Deum, unice. &#1504;&#1499;&#1495; (R. &#1504;&#1498;) means properly fixing, or holding fast with the look, and &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; (as the Arab. najad, to be clear, to be in sight, shows) the rising up which makes the object stand conspicuous before the eyes; both denote here that which lies straight before us, and presents itself to the eye looking straight out. The naming of the &#1506;&#1508;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1506;&#1508;&#1506;&#1507;, to flutter, to move tremblingly), which belongs not to the seeing apparatus of the eye but to its protection, is introduced by the poetical parallelism; for the eyelids, including in this word the twinkling, in their movement follow the direction of the seeing eye. On the form &#1497;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (fut. Hiph. of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be straight), defective according to the Masora, with the Jod audible, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#012">Hos 7:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002">Ch1 12:2</A>, and under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#017">Gen 8:17</A>; the softened form &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; does not occur, we find only &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; or &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026">Pro 4:26</A>
<p>The understanding of this rule is dependent on the right interpretation of &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505;, which means neither "weigh off" (Ewald) nor "measure off" (Hitzig, Zckler). &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505; has once, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003">Psa 58:3</A>, the meaning to weigh out, as the denom. of &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1505;, a level, a steelyard;
<p>(Note: The Arabic word tefl&#305;&#770;s, said to be of the same signification (a balance), and which is given in the most recent editions of Gesenius' Lexicon, has been already shown under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016">Job 37:16</A> to be a word devoid of all evidence.)
<p>everywhere else it means to make even, to make level, to open a road: vid., under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#007">Isa 26:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012">Isa 40:12</A>. The admonition thus refers not to the careful consideration which measures the way leading to the goal which one wishes to reach, but to the preparation of the way by the removal of that which prevents unhindered progress and makes the way insecure. The same meaning appears if &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505;, of cognate meaning with &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, denoted first to level, and then to make straight with the level (Fleischer). We must remove all that can become a moral hindrance or a dangerous obstacle, in our life-course, in order that we may make right steps with our feet, as the lxx (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013">Heb 12:13</A>) translate. 26b is only another expression for this thought. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#006">Ch2 27:6</A>) means to give a direction to his way; a right way, which keeps in and facilitates the keeping in the straight direction, is accordingly called &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;; and "let all thy ways be right" (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#005">Psa 119:5</A>, lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;) will thus mean: see to it that all the ways which thou goest lead straight to the end.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027">Pro 4:27</A>
<p>In closest connection with the preceding, 27a cautions against by-ways and indirect courses, and 27b continues it in the briefest moral expression, which is here &#1492;&#1505;&#1512; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1498; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; instead of &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007">Pro 3:7</A>, for the figure is derived from the way. The lxx has other four lines after this verse (27), which we have endeavoured to retranslate into the Hebrew (Introd. p. 47). They are by no means genuine; for while in 27a right and left are equivalent to by-ways, here the right and left side are distinguished as that of truth and its contrary; and while there [in lxx] the &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; is required of man, here it is promised as the operation of God, which is no contradiction, but in this similarity of expression betrays poverty of style. Hitzig disputes also the genuineness of the Hebrew <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027">Pro 4:27</A>. But it continues explanatorily <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026">Pro 4:26</A>, and is related to it, yet not as a gloss, and in the general relation of 26 and 27a there comes a word, certainly not unwelcome, such as 27b, which impresses the moral stamp on these thoughts. That with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027">Pro 4:27</A> the admonition of his father, which the poet, placing himself back into the period of his youth, reproduces, is not yet concluded, the resumption of the address &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001">Pro 5:1</A>, makes evident; while on the other hand the address &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#007">Pro 5:7</A> shows that at that point there is advance made from the recollections of his father's house to conclusions therefrom, for the circle of young men by whom the poet conceives himself to be surrounded. That in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#007">Pro 5:7</A>. a subject of the warning with which the seventh address closes is retained and further prosecuted, does not in the connection of all these addresses contradict the opinion that with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#007">Pro 5:7</A> a new address begins. But the opinion that the warning against adultery does not agree (Zckler) with the designation &#1512;&#1498;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003">Pro 4:3</A>, given to him to whom it is addressed, is refuted by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#005">Ch1 22:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#007">Ch2 13:7</A>.
