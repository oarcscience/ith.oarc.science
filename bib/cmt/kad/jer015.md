### [Jeremiah Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 15:1</span></span>

"And Jahveh said unto me: If Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet would
not my soul incline to this people. Drive them from my face, that they
go forth. [Jer 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002). And if they say
to thee: Whither shall we go forth? then say to them: Thus hath Jahveh
said - Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword,
to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as
are for the captivity, to the captivity. [Jer
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003). And I appoint over them four
kinds, saith Jahveh: the sword to slay and the dogs to tear, the fowls
of the heaven and the cattle of the earth, to devour and destroy. [Jer
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004). And I give them up to be abused
to all kingdoms of the earth, for Manasseh's sake, the son of Hezekiah
king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem. [Jer
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#005). For who shall have pity upon
thee, Jerusalem? and who shall bemoan thee? and who shall go aside to
ask after thy welfare? [Jer 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#006). Thou
hast rejected me, saith Jahveh; thou goest backwards, and so I stretch
forth mine hand against thee and destroy thee; I am weary of repenting.
[Jer 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007). And I fan them with a fain
into the gates of the land: bereave, ruin my people; from their ways
they turned not. [Jer 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008). More in
number are his widows become unto me than the sand of the sea; I bring
to them, against the mother of the young man, a spoiler at noon-day; I
cause to fall upon her suddenly anguish and terrors. [Jer
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#009). She that hath borne seven
languisheth, she breatheth out her soul, her sun goeth down while yet it
is day, she is put to shame and confounded; and their residue I give to
the sword before their enemies, saith Jahveh."

The Lord had indeed distinctly refused the favour sought for Judah; yet
the command to disclose to the people the sorrow of his own soul at
their calamity ([Jer 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017) and [Jer
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018)) gave the prophet courage to
renew his supplication, and to ask of the Lord if He had in very truth
cast off Judah and Zion ([Jer 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019)),
and to set forth the reasons which made this seem impossible ([Jer
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020) -22). In the question, [Jer
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019), the emphasis lies on the מאסתּ,
strengthened as it is by the inf. abs.: hast Thou utterly or really
rejected? The form of the question is the same as that in [Jer
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014); first the double question,
dealing with a state of affairs which the questioner is unable to regard
as being actually the case, and then a further question, conveying
wonder at what has happened. גּעל, loathe, cast from one, is synonymous
with מאס. The second clause agrees verbally with [Jer
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#015). The reasons why the Lord cannot
have wholly rejected Judah are: 1. That they acknowledge their
wickedness. Confession of sin is the beginning of return to God; and in
case of such return, the Lord, by His compassion, has vouchsafed to His
people forgiveness and the renewal of covenant blessings; cf. [Lev
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041)., [Deu
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#002). Along with their own evil doing,
the transgression of their fathers is mentioned, cf. [Jer
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005)., [Jer
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025)., that full confession may be
made of the entire weight of wickedness for which Israel has made itself
answerable. So that, on its own account, Judah has no claim upon the
help of its God. But the Lord may be moved thereto by regard for His
name and the covenant relation. On this is founded the prayer of [Jer
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#021) : Abhor not, sc. thy people, for
Thy name's sake, lest Thou appear powerless to help in the eyes of the
nations; see on [Jer 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007) and on [Num
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#016). נבּל, lit., to treat as fools,
see on [Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015), here: make
contemptible. The throne of the glory of God is the temple, where Jahveh
sits enthroned over the ark of the covenant in the holy of holies, [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022), etc. The destruction of
Jerusalem would, by the sack of the temple, dishonour the throne of the
Lord. The object to "remember," viz., "Thy covenant," comes after "break
not." The remembering or rememberedness of the covenant is shown in the
not breaking maintenance of the same; cf. [Lev
26:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#044). Lastly, we have in v. 22 the
final motive for supplication: that the Lord alone can put an end to
trouble. Neither the vain gods of the heathen (הבלים, see [Jer
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019)) can procure rain, nor can the
heaven, as one of the powers of nature, without power from God. אתּה
הוּא, Thou art (הוּא is the copula between subject and predicate). Thou
hast made all these. Not: the heaven and the earth, as Hitz. and Gr.
would make it, after [Isa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016); still
less is it, with Calv.: the punishment inflicted on us; but, as אלּה
demands, the things mentioned immediately before: caelum, pluvias et
quidquid est in omni rerum natura, Ros. Only when thus taken, does the
clause contain any motive for: we wait upon Thee, i.e., expect from Thee
help out of our trouble. It further clearly appears from this verse that
the supplication was called forth by the calamity depicted in [Jer
15:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002).

[Jer 15:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)

Decisive refusal of the petition. - [Jer
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001). Even Moses and Samuel, who stood
so far in God's favour that by their supplications they repeatedly
rescued their people from overwhelming ruin (cf. [Exo
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#011); [Exo
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011)., [Num
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013)., and [Sa1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#009)., [Jer
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#017)., [Psa
99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006)), if they were to come now before
the Lord, would not incline His love towards this people. אל indicates
the direction of the soul towards any one; in this connection: the
inclination of it towards the people. He has cast off this people and
will no longer let them come before His face. In [Jer
15:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002) this is set forth with terrible
earnestness. We must supply the object, "this people," to "drive" from
the preceding clause. "From my face" implies the people's standing
before the Lord in the temple, where they had appeared bringing
sacrifices, and by prayer invoking His help ([Jer
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012)). To go forth from the temple =
to go forth from God's face. [Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002). But in case they ask where they
are to go to, Jeremiah is to give them the sarcastic direction: Each to
the destruction allotted to him. He that is appointed to death, shall go
forth to death, etc. The clauses: such as are for death, etc., are to be
filled up after the analogy of [Sa2
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#020); [Kg2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001), so that before the second
"death," "sword," etc., we supply the verb "shall go." There are
mentioned four kinds of punishments that are to befall the people. The
"death" mentioned over and above the sword is death by disease, for
which we have in [Jer 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012) דּבר,
pestilence, disease; cf. [Jer 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#011),
where death, captivity, and sword are mentioned together, with [Eze
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021), sword, famine, wild beasts, and
disease (דּבר), and [Eze 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#027), sword,
wild beasts, and disease. This doom is made more terrible in [Jer
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003). The Lord will appoint over them
(פּקד as in [Jer 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#021)) four kinds,
i.e., four different destructive powers which shall prepare a miserable
end for them. One is the sword already mentioned in [Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002), which slays them; the three
others are to execute judgment on the dead: the dogs which shall tear,
mutilate, and partly devour the dead bodies (cf. [Kg2
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#035), [Kg2
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#037)), and birds and beasts of prey,
vultures, jackals, and others, which shall make an end of such portions
as are left by the dogs. In [Jer 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004)
the whole is summed up in the threatening of [Deu
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025), that the people shall be
delivered over to be abused to all the kingdoms of the earth, and the
cause of this terrible judgment is mentioned. The Chet. זועה is not to
be read זועה, but זועה, and is the contracted form from זעוה, see on
[Deu 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025), from the rad. זוּע, lit.,
tossing hither and thither, hence for maltreatment. For the sake of King
Manasseh, who by his godless courses had filled up the measure of the
people's sins, so that the Lord must cast Judah away from His face, and
give it up to the heathen to be chastised; cf. [Kg2
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026); [Kg2
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#003), with the exposition of these
passages; and as to what Manasseh did, see 2 Kings 21:1-16.

[Jeremiah 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 15:5</span></span>

In [Jer 15:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#005) we have a still further
account of this appalling judgment and its causes. The grounding כּי in
[Jer 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#005) attaches to the central
thought of [Jer 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004). The sinful
people will be given up to all the kingdoms of the earth to be ill used,
for no one will or can have compassion on Jerusalem, since its rejection
by God is a just punishment for its rejection of the Lord ([Jer
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#006)). "Have pity" and "bemoan" denote
loving sympathy for the fall of the unfortunate. חמל, to feel sympathy;
נוּד, to lament and bemoan. סוּר, to swerve from the straight way, and
turn aside or enter into any one's house; cf. [Gen
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#002)., [Exo
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#003), etc. ל שׁאל לשׁלום, to inquire of
one as to his health, cf. [Exo 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#007);
then: to salute one, to desire לך שׁלום, [Gen
43:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#027); [Jdg
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#015), and often. Not only will none
show sympathy for Jerusalem, none will even ask how it goes with her
welfare.

[Jer 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#006)

The reason of this treatment: because Jerusalem has dishonoured and
rejected its God, therefore He now stretched out His hand to destroy it.
To go backwards, instead of following the Lord, cf. [Jer
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#024). This determination the Lord will
not change, for He is weary of repenting. הנּחם frequently of the
withdrawal, in grace and pity, of a divine decree to punish, cf. [Jer
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028), [Gen
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006)., [Joe
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014), etc.

[Jer 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007)

ואזרם is a continuation of ואט, [Jer
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#006), and, like the latter, is to be
understood prophetically of what God has irrevocably determined to do.
It is not a description of what is past, an allusion to the battle lost
at Megiddo, as Hitz., carrying out his priori system of slighting
prophecy, supposes. To take the verbs of this verse as proper
preterites, as J. D. Mich. and Ew. also do, is not in keeping with the
contents of the clauses. In the first clause Ew. and Gr. translate שׁערי
gates, i.e., exits, boundaries of the earth, and thereby understand the
remotest lands of the earth, the four corners of extremities of the
earth, [Isa 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012) (Ew.). But "gates"
cannot be looked on as corners or extremities, nor are they ends or
borders, but the inlets and outlets of cities. For how can a man
construe to himself the ends of the earth as the outlets of it? where
could one go to from there? Hence it is impossible to take הארץ of the
earth in this case; it is the land of Judah. The gates of the land are
either mentioned by synecdoche for the cities, cf. [Mic
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005), or are the approaches to the land
(cf. [Nah 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#013)), its outlets and
inlets. Here the context demands the latter sense. זרה, to fan, c. בּ
loci, to scatter into a place, cf. [Eze
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#015); [Eze
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#026) : fan into the outlets of the
land, i.e., cast out of the land. שׁכּל, make the people childless, by
the fall in battle of the sons, the young men, cf. [Eze
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#017). The threat is intensified by
אבּדתּי, added as asyndeton. The last clause: from their ways, etc.,
subjoins the reason.

[Jer 15:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008)

By the death of the sons, the women lose their husbands, and become
widows. לי is the dative of sympathetic interest. "Sand of the sea" is
the figure for a countless number. ימּים is poetic plural; cf. [Psa
78:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#027); [Job
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#003). On these defenceless women come
suddenly spoilers, and these mothers who had perhaps borne seven sons
give up the ghost and perish without succour, because their sons have
fallen in war. Thus proceeds the portrayal as Hitz. has well exhibited
it. על אם בּחוּר is variously interpreted. We must reject the view taken
by Chr. B. Mich. from the Syr. and Arab. versions: upon mother and young
man; as also the view of Rashi, Cler., Eichh., Dahl., etc., that אם
means the mother-city, i.e., Jerusalem. The true rendering is that of
Jerome and Kimchi, who have been followed by J. D. Mich., Hitz., Ew.,
Graf, and Ng.: upon the mother of the youth or young warrior. This view
is favoured by the correspondence of the woman mentioned in [Job
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#009) who had borne seven sons. Both are
individualized as women of full bodily vigour, to lend vividness to the
thought that no age and no sex will escape destruction בּצּהרים, at
clear noontide, when one least looks for an attack. Thus the word
corresponds with the "suddenly" of the next clause. עיר, Aramaic form
for ציר, [Isa 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008), pangs. The bearer
of seven, i.e., the mother of many sons. Seven as the perfect number of
children given in blessing by God, cf. [Sa1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005); [Rut
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#015). "She breathes to her life," cf.
[Job 31:39](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#039). Graf wrongly: she sighs.
The sun of her life sets (בּאה) while it is still day, before the
evening of her life has been reached, cf. [Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009). "Is put to shame and confounded"
is not to be referred to the son, but the mother, who, bereaved of her
children, goes covered with shame to the grave. The Keri בּא for בּאה is
an unnecessary change, since שׁמשׁ is also construed as fem., [Gen
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017). The description closes with a
glance cast on those left in life after the overthrow of Jerusalem.
These are to be given to the sword when in flight before their enemies,
cf. [Mic 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014).

[Jeremiah 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 15:10</span></span>

Complaint of the Prophet, and Soothing Answer of the Lord. - His sorrow
at the rejection by God of his petition so overcomes the prophet, that
he gives utterance to the wish: he had rather not have been born than
live on in the calling in which he must ever foretell misery and ruin to
his people, thereby provoking hatred and attacks, while his heart is
like to break for grief and fellow-feeling; whereupon the Lord
reprovingly replies as in [Jer
15:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011).

[Jer 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010)

"Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast born me, a man of strive and
contention to all the earth! I have not lent out, nor have men lent to
me; all curse me. [Jer 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011). Jahveh
saith, Verily I strengthen thee to thy good; verily I cause the enemy to
entreat thee in the time of evil and of trouble. [Jer
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012). Does iron break, iron from the
north and brass? [Jer 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013). Thy
substance and thy treasures give I for a prey without a price, and that
for all thy sins, and in all thy borders, [Jer
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014). And cause thine enemies bring
it into a land which thou knowest not; for fire burneth in mine anger,
against you it is kindled."

Woe is me, exclaims Jeremiah in [Jer
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010), that my mother brought me
forth! The apostrophe to his mother is significant of the depth of his
sorrow, and is not to be understood as if he were casting any reproach
on his mother; it is an appeal to his mother to share with him his
sorrow at his lot. This lament is consequently very different from Job's
cursing of the day of his birth, [Job
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001). The apposition to the suffix
"me," the man of strife and contention, conveys the meaning of the
lament in this wise: me, who must yet be a man, with whom the whole
world strives and contends. Ew. wrongly render it: "to be a man of
strife," etc.; for it was not his mother's fault that he became such an
one. The second clause intimates that he has not provoked the strife and
contention. נשׁה, lend, i.e., give on loan, and with בּ, to lend to a
person, lend out; hence נשׁה, debtor, and נשׁה בו, creditor, [Isa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002). These words are not an
individualizing of the thought: all interchange of friendly services
between me and human society is broken off (Hitz.). For intercourse with
one's fellow-men does not chiefly, or in the foremost place, consist in
lending and borrowing of gold and other articles. Borrowing and lending
is rather the frequent occasion of strife and ill-will;

(Note: Calvin aptly remarks: Unde enim inter homines et lites et jurgia,
nisi quia male inter ipsos convenit, dum ultro et citro negotiantur?)

and it is in this reference that it is here brought up. Jeremiah says he
has neither as bad debtor or disobliging creditor given occasion to
hatred and quarrelling, and yet all curse him. This is the meaning of
the last words, in which the form מקללוני is hard to explain. The
rabbinical attempts to clear it up by means of a commingling of the
verbs קלל and קלה are now, and reasonably, given up. Ew. (Gram. 350, c)
wants to make it מקללנני; but probably the form has arisen merely out of
the wrong dividing of a word, and ought to be read כּלּהם קללוּני. So
read most recent scholars, after the example of J. D. Mich.; cf. also
Bttcher, Grammat. ii. S. 322, note. It is true that we nowhere else find
כּלּהם; but we find an analogy in the archaic כּלּהם . In its favour we
have, besides, the circumstance, that the heavy form הם is by preference
appended to short words; see Bttcher, as above, S. 21.

[Jer 15:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011)

To this complaint the Lord makes answer in [Jer
15:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011), first giving the prophet the
prospect of complete vindication against those that oppose him ([Jer
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011)), and then ([Jer
15:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012)) pointing to the
circumstances that shall compel the people to this result. The
introduction of God's answer by אמר יהוה without כּה is found also in
[Jer 46:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#025), where Graf erroneously
seeks to join the formula with what precedes. In the present 11th verse
the want of the כּה is the less felt, since the word from the Lord that
follows bears in the first place upon the prophet himself, and is not
addressed to the people. אם לא is a particle of asseveration,
introducing the answer which follows with a solemn assurance. The
vowel-points of שׁרותך fo require שׁריתיך, 1 pers. perf., from שׁרה =
the Aram. שׁרא, loose, solve ([Dan
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#012)): I loose (free) thee to thy
good. The Chet. is variously read and rendered. By reason of the
preceding אם, the view is improbable that we have here an infinitive;
either שׁרותך, inf. Pi. of שׁרר in the sig. inflict suffering: "thy
affliction becomes welfare" (Hitz.); or שׁרותך, inf. Kal of שׁרה, set
free: thy release falls out to thy good (Ros., etc.). The context
suggests the 1 pers. perf. of שׁרר, against which the defective written
form is no argument, since this occurs frequently elsewhere, e.g.,
ענּתך, [Nah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012). The question
remains: whether we are to take שׁרר according to the Hebrew usage: I
afflict thee to thy good, harass thee to thine advantage (Gesen. in the
thes. p. 1482, and Ng.), or according to the Aramaic (\_ra) in the sig.
firmabo, stabiliam: I strengthen thee or support thee to thy good (Ew.,
Maur.). We prefer the latter rendering, because the saying: I afflict
thee, is not true of God; since the prophet's troubles came not from
God, nor is Jeremiah complaining of affliction at the hand of God, but
only that he was treated as an enemy by all the world. לטוב, for good,
as in [Psa 119:122](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122), so that it shall
fall out well for thee, lead to a happy issue, for which we have
elsewhere לטובה, [Jer 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011), [Psa
86:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#017); [Neh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#019). - This happy issue is disclosed
in the second clause: I bring it about that the enemy shall in time of
trouble turn himself in supplication to thee, because he shall recognise
in the prophet's prayers the only way of safety; cf. the fulfilment of
this promise, [Jer 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001)., [Jer
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003); [Jer
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014)., [Jer
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002). הפנּיע, here causative,
elsewhere only with the sig. of the Kal, e.g., [Jer
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025), [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012). "The enemy," in unlimited
generality: each of thine adversaries.

[Jer 15:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012)

That the case will turn out so is intimated by [Jer
15:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012), the exposition of which is,
however, difficult and much debated. [Jer
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012) is rendered either: can iron
(ordinary iron) break northern iron and brass (the first "iron" being
taken as subject, the second as object)? or: can one break iron,
(namely) iron of the north, and brass ("iron" being taken both times as
object, and "break" having its subject indefinite)? or: can iron...break
(ירוע intrans. as in [Jer 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016))? Of
these three translations the first has little probability, inasmuch as
the simile of one kind of iron breaking another is unnatural. But
Hitz.'s view is wholly unnatural: that the first "iron" and "brass" are
the object, and that "iron from the north" is subject, standing as it
does between the two objects, as in [Sol
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#006), where, however, the construction
alleged is still very doubtful. Nor does the sense, which would in this
way be expressed, go far to commend this rendering. By iron and brass we
would then have to understand, according to [Jer
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028), the stiff-necked Jewish people;
and by iron from the north, the calamity that was to come from the
north. Thus the sense would be: will this calamity break the sullen
obstinacy of the prophet's enemies? will it make them pliable? The verse
would thus contain an objection on the part of the prophet against the
concession vouchsafed by God in [Jer
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011). With this idea, however, [Jer
15:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011) are emphatically not in
harmony. The other two translations take each a different view of the
sense. The one party understand by iron and brass the prophet; the
other, either the Jewish people or the northern might of the Chaldean
empire. Holding that the prophet is so symbolized, L. de Dieu and Umbr.
give the sense thus: "Let him but bethink him of his immoveable firmness
against the onsets of the world; in spite of all, he is iron, northern
iron and brass, that cannot be broken." Thus God would here be speaking
to the prophet. Dahl., again, holds the verse to be spoken by the
prophet, and gives the sense: Can I, a frail and feeble man, break the
determination of a numerous and stiff-necked nation? Against the later
view the objection already alleged against Hitz. is decisive, showing as
it did that the verse cannot be the prophet's speech or complaint;
against the former, the improbability that God would call the prophet
iron, northern iron and brass, when the very complaint he has making
showed how little of the firmness of iron he had about him. If by the
northern iron we understand the Jewish people, then God would here say
to the prophet, that he should always contend in vain against the
stiff-neckedness of the people (Eichh.). This would have been but small
comfort for him. But the appellation of northern iron does not at all
fit the Jewish people. For the observation that the hardest iron, the
steel made by the Chalybes in Pontus, was imported from the north, does
not serve the turn; since a distinction between ordinary iron and very
hard iron nowhere else appears in the Old Testament. The attribute "from
the north" points manifestly to the iron sway of the Chaldean empire
(Ros., Ew., Maur., and many others); and the meaning of the verse can
only be this: As little as a man can break iron, will the Jewish people
be able to break the hostile power of the north ([Jer
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#020)). Taken thus, the pictorial
style of the verse contains a suggestion that the adversaries of the
prophet will, by the crushing power of the Chaldeans, be reduced to the
condition of turning themselves in supplication to the prophet.

[Jer 15:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013)

With this [Jer 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013) and [Jer
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014) are thus connected: This time of
evil and tribulation ([Jer 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010)) will
not last long. Their enemies will carry off the people's substance and
treasures as their booty into a strange land. These verses are to be
taken, with Umbr., as a declaration from the mouth of the Lord to His
guilt-burdened people. This appears from the contents of the verses. The
immediate transition from the address to the prophet to that to the
people is to be explained by the fact, that both the prophet's
complaint, [Jer 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010), and God's
answer, [Jer 15:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011), have a full
bearing on the people; the prophet's complaint at the attacks on the
part of the people serving to force them to a sense of their obstinacy
against the Lord, and God's answer to the complaint, that the prophet's
announcement will come true, and that he will then be justified, serving
to crush their sullen doggedness. The connection of thought in [Jer
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013) and [Jer
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014) is thus: The people that so
assaults thee, by reason of thy threatening judgment, will not break the
iron might of the Chaldeans, but will by them be overwhelmed. It will
come about as thou hast declared to them in my name; their substance and
their treasures will I give as booty to the Chaldeans. לא = בּלא מחיר,
[Isa 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001), not for purchase-money,
i.e., freely. As God sells His people for nought, i.e., gives them up to
their enemies (cf. [Isa 52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003); [Psa
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013)), so here He threatens to
deliver up their treasures to the enemy as a booty, and for nought. When
Graf says that this last thought has no sufficient meaning, his reasons
therefor do not appear. Nor is there anything "peculiar," or such as
could throw suspicion on the passage, in the juxtaposition of the two
qualifying phrases: and that for all thy sins, and in all thy borders.
The latter phrase bears unmistakeably on the treasures, not on the sins.
"Cause...to bring it," lit., I cause them (the treasures) to pass with
thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not, i.e., I cause the
enemies to bring them, etc. Hitz. and Graf erroneously: I carry thine
enemies away into a land; which affords no suitable sense. The grounding
clause: for hire, etc., is taken from [Deu
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022), to show that the threatening of
judgment contained in Moses' song is about to come upon degenerate
Judah. "Against you it is kindled" apply the words to Jeremiah's
contemporaries.

(Note: [Jer 15:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011) are pronounced
spurious by Hitz., Graf, and Ng., on the ground that [Jer
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013) and [Jer
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014) are a mere quotation, corrupted
in the text, from [Jer 17:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003), and
that all the three verses destroy the connection, containing an address
to the people that does not at all fit into the context. But the
interruption of the continuity could at most prove that the verses had
got into a wrong place, as is supposed by Ew., who transposes them, and
puts them next to [Jer 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#009). But for
this change in place there are no sufficient grounds, since, as our
exposition of them shows, the verses in question can be very well
understood in the place which they at present occupy. The other
allegation, that [Jer 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013) and [Jer
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014) are a quotation, corrupted in
text, from [Jer 17:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003), is totally
without proof. In [Jer 17:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003) we have
simply the central thoughts of the present passage repeated, but
modified to suit their new context, after the manner characteristic of
Jeremiah. The genuineness of the verses is supported by the testimony of
the lxx, which has them here, while it omits them in [Jer
17:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003); and by the fact, that it is
inconceivable they should have been interpolated as a gloss in a wholly
unsuitable place. For those who impugn the genuineness have not even
made the attempt to show the possibility or probability of such a gloss
arising.)

[Jer 15:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015)

Jeremiah continues his complaint. - [Jer
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015). "Thou knowest it, Jahveh;
remember me, and visit me, and revenge me on my persecutors! Do not, in
Thy long-suffering, take me away; know that for Thy sake I bear
reproach. [Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016). Thy words were
found, and I did eat them; and Thy words were to me a delight and the
joy of my heart: for Thy name was named upon me, Jahveh, God of hosts.
[Jer 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017). I sat not in the assembly
of the laughers, nor was merry; because of Thy hand I sat solitary; for
with indignation Thou hast filled me. [Jer
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018). Why is my pain perpetual, and
my wound malignant? will not heal. Wilt Thou really be to me as a
deceiving brook, a water that doth not endure?"

The Lord's answer, [Jer 15:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011), has
not yet restored tranquillity to the prophet's mind; since in it his
vindication by means of the abasement of his adversaries had been kept
at an indefinite distance. And so he now, [Jer
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015), prays the Lord to revenge him
on his adversaries, and not to let him perish, since for His sake he
bears reproach. The object to "Thou knowest, Lord," appears from the
context - namely: "the attacks which I endure," or more generally: Thou
knowest my case, my distress. At the same time he clearly means the
harassment detailed in [Jer 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010), so
that "Thou knowest" is, as to its sense, directly connected with [Jer
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010). But it by no means follows from
this that [Jer 15:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011) are not
original; only that Jeremiah did not feel his anxiety put at rest by the
divine answer conveyed in these verses. In the climax: Remember me,
visit me, i.e., turn Thy care on me, and revenge me, we have the
utterance of the importunity of his prayer, and therein, too, the
extremity of his distress. According to Thy long-suffering, i.e., the
long-suffering Thou showest towards my persecutors, take me not away,
i.e., do not deliver me up to final ruin. This prayer he supports by the
reminder, that for the Lord's sake he bears reproach; cf. [Psa
69:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008). Further, the imperative: know,
recognise, bethink thee of, is the utterance of urgent prayer. In [Jer
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016) he exhibits how he suffers for
the Lord's sake. The words of the Lord which came to him he has received
with eagerness, as it had been the choicest dainties. "Thy words were
found" intimates that he had come into possession of them as something
actual, without particularizing how they were revealed. With the
figurative expression: I ate them, cf. the symbolical embodiment of the
figure, [Eze 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009); [Eze
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#003), Apoc. [Jer
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009). The Keri דּבריך is an uncalled
for correction, suggested by the preceding יהי, and the Chet. is
perfectly correct. Thy words turned out to me a joy and delight, because
Thy name was named upon me, i.e., because Thou hast revealed Thyself to
me, hast chosen me to be the proclaimer of Thy word.

[Jer 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017)

To this calling he has devoted his whole life: has not sat in the
assembly of the laughers, nor made merry with them; but sat alone, i.e.,
avoided all cheerful company. Because of Thy hand, i.e., because Thy
hand had laid hold on me. The hand of Jahveh is the divine power which
took possession of the prophets, transported their spirit to the
ecstatic domain of inner vision, and impelled to prophesy; cf. [Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007); [Isa
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011); [Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003), etc. Alone I sat, because Thou
hast filled me with indignation. זעם is the wrath of God against the
moral corruptness and infatuation of Judah, with which the Spirit of God
has filled Jeremiah in order that he may publish it abroad, cf. [Jer
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011). The sadness of what he had to
publish filled his heart with the deepest grief, and constrained him to
keep far from all cheery good fellowship.

[Jer 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018)

Why is my pain become perpetual? "My pain" is the pain or grief he feels
at the judgment he has to announce to the people; not his pain at the
hostility he has on that account to endure. נצח adverbial = לנצח, as in
[Amo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011); [Psa
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002), etc. "My wound," the blow that
has fallen on him. אנוּשׁה, malignant, is explained by "(that) will not
heal," cf. [Jer 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#012); [Mic
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#009). The clause 'היו still depends on
למּה, and the infin. gives emphasis: Wilt Thou really be? אכזב, lit.,
lying, deception, means here, and in [Mic
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016), a deceptive torrent that dries
up in the season of drought, and so disappoints the hope of finding
water, cf. [Job 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015). "A water," etc.,
is epexegesis: water that doth not endure. To this the Lord answers -

[Jer 15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019)

By reprimanding his impatience, and by again assuring him of His
protection and of rescue from the power of his oppressors. - [Jer
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019). "Therefore thus saith Jahveh:
If thou return, then will I bring thee again to serve me; and if thou
separate the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. They
will return to thee, but thou shalt not return unto them. [Jer
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020). And I make thee unto this
people a strong wall of brass, so that they fight against thee, but
prevail not against thee; for I am with thee, to help thee and to save
thee, saith Jahveh. [Jer 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#021). And I
save thee out of the hand of the wicked, and deliver thee out of the
clutch of the violent."

In the words: if thou return, lies the reproach that in his complaint,
in which his indignation had hurried him on to doubt God's faithfulness,
Jeremiah had sinned and must repent. אשׁיבך is by many commentators
taken adverbially and joined with the following words: then will I again
cause thee to stand before me. But this adverbial use has been proved
only for the Kal of שׁוּב, not for the Hiphil, which must here be taken
by itself: then will I bring thee again, sc. into proper relations with
me - namely, to stand before me, i.e., to be my servant. עמד , of the
standing of the servant before his lord, to receive his commands, and so
also of prophets, cf. [Kg1 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001); [Kg1
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#015); [Kg2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#014), etc. In the words: if thou make
to go forth, i.e., separate the precious from the vile, we have the
figure of metal-refining, in course of which the pure metal is by fusion
parted from the earthy and other ingredients mixed with it. The meaning
of the figure is, however, variously understood. Some think here,
unfittingly, of good and bad men; so Chald. and Rashi: if thou cause the
good to come forth of the bad, turn the good into bad; or, if out of the
evil mass thou cause to come forth at least a few as good, i.e., if thou
convert them (Chr. B. Mich., Ros., etc.). For we cannot here have to do
with the issue of his labours, as Graf well remarks, since this did not
lie in his own power. Just as little is the case one of contrast between
God's word and man's word, the view adopted by Ven., Eichh., Dahl.,
Hitz., Ew. The idea that Jeremiah presented man's word for God's word,
or God's word mixed with spurious, human additions, is utterly foreign
to the context; nay, rather it was just because he declared only what
God imposed on him that he was so hard bested. Further, that idea is
wholly inconsistent with the nature of true prophecy. Maurer has hit
upon the truth: si quae pretiosa in te sunt, admixtis liberaveris
sordibus, si virtutes quas habes maculis liberaveris impatientiae et
iracundiae; with whom Graf agrees. כּפי (with the so-called כ verit.),
as my mouth shalt thou be, i.e., as the instrument by which I speak, cf.
[Exo 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#016). Then shall his labours be
crowned with success. They (the adversaries) will turn themselves to
thee, in the manner shown in [Jer
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011), but thou shalt not turn thyself
to them, i.e., not yield to their wishes or permit thyself to be moved
by them from the right way. [Jer
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020). After this reprimand, the Lord
renews to him the promise of His most active support, such as He had
promised him at his call, [Jer 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018).;
"to save thee" being amplified in [Jer
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#021).
