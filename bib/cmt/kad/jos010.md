### [Joshua Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 10:1</span></span>

The report that Joshua had taken Ai, and put it, like Jericho, under the
ban, and that the Gibeonites had concluded a treaty with Israel, filled
Adonizedek the king of Jerusalem with alarm, as Gibeon was a large town,
like one of the king's towns, even larger than Ai, and its inhabitants
were brave men. He therefore joined with the kings of Hebron, Jarmuth,
Lachish, and Eglon, to make a common attack upon Gibeon, and punish it
for its alliance with the Israelites, and at the same time to put a
check upon the further conquests of Israel. Adonizedek, i.e., lord of
righteousness, is synonymous with Melchizedek (king of righteousness),
and was a title of the Jebusite kings, as Pharaoh was of the Egyptian.
Jerusalem, i.e., the founding or possession of peace, called Salem in
the time of Abraham ([Gen 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018).md), was
the proper name of the town, which was also frequently called by the
name of its Canaanitish inhabitants Jebus ([Jdg
19:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#010.md); [Ch1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#004).md), or "city of the Jebusite"
(Ir-Jebusi, [Jdg 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#011).md), sometimes
also in a contracted form, Jebusi (היבוּסי, [Jos
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#016.md), [Jos
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028.md); [Jos
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008.md); [Sa2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008).md).

(Note: In our English version, we have the Hebrew word itself simply
transposed in [Jos 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#016.md), [Jos
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028.md); whilst it is rendered "the
Jebusite" in [Jos 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008.md), and "the
Jebusites" in [Sa2 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008). - Tr..md)

On the division of the land it was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin
([Jos 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028).md); but being situated upon
the border of Judah ([Jos 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008).md), it
was conquered, and burned by the sons of Judah after the death of Joshua
([Jdg 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008).md). It was very soon taken
again and rebuilt by the Jebusites, whom the sons of Judah were unable
to destroy ([Jos 15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063.md); [Jdg
19:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#010).md), so that both Benjaminites
and Judahites lived there along with the Jebusites ([Jdg
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#021.md); [Jos
15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063).md); and the upper town especially,
upon the summit of Mount Zion, remained as a fortification in the
possession of the Jebusites, until David conquered it ([Sa2
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006)..md), made it the capital of his
kingdom, and called it by his own name, "the city of David," after which
the old name of Jebus fell into disuse. Hebron, the town of Arba the
Anakite ([Jos 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015.md), etc.; see at [Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002).md), was twenty-two Roman miles
south of Jerusalem, in a deep and narrow valley upon the mountains of
Judah, a town of the greatest antiquity ([Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022).md), now called el Khalil, i.e.,
the friend (of God), with reference to Abraham's sojourn there. The
ruins of an ancient heathen temple are still to be seen there, as well
as the Haram, built of colossal blocks, which contains, according to
Mohammedan tradition, the burial-place of the patriarchs (see at [Gen
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#017).md). Jarmuth, in the lowlands of
Judah ([Jos 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035.md); [Neh
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#029).md), according to the Onom. (s. v.
Jermus) a hamlet, Jermucha (Ἰερμοχωῶς), ten Roman miles from
Eleutheropolis, on the road to Jerusalem, is the modern Jarmuk, a
village on a lofty hill, with the remains of walls and cisterns of a
very ancient date, the name of which, according to Van de Velde (Mem.
pp. 115-6), is pronounced Tell 'Armuth by the Arabs (see Rob. Pal. ii.
p. 344). Lachish, in the lowlands of Judah ([Jos
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#039).md), was fortified by Rehoboam
([Ch2 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#009).md), and besieged by
Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar ([Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md); [Kg2
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008.md); [Jer
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007).md), and was still inhabited by Jews
after the return from the captivity ([Neh
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#030).md). It is probably to be found in
Um Lakis, an old place upon a low round hill, covered with heaps of
small round stones thrown together in great confusion, containing relics
of marble columns; it is about an hour and a quarter to the west of
Ajlun, and seven hours to the west of Eleutheropolis.

(Note: It is true that Robinson dispute the identity of Um Lakis with
the ancient Lachish (Pal. ii. p. 388), but "not on any reasonable
ground" (Van de Velde, Mem. p. 320). The statement in the Onom. (s. v.
Lochis), that it was seven Roman miles to the south of Eleutheropolis,
cannot prove much, as it may easily contain an error in the number, and
Robinson does not admit its authority even in the case of Eglon (Pal.
ii. p. 392). Still less can Knobel's conjecture be correct, that it is
to be found in the old place called Sukkarijeh, two hours and a half to
the south-west of Beit Jibrin (Eleutheropolis), as Sukkarijeh is on the
east of Ajlun, whereas, according to [Jos
10:31-36](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#031.md), Lachish is to be sought for
on the west of Eglon.)

Eglon: also in the lowlands of Judah ([Jos
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#039).md). The present name is Ajln, a
heap of ruins, about three-quarters of an hour to the east of Um Lakis
(see Rob. Pal. ii. p. 392, and Van de Velde, Mem. p. 308). In the Onom.
(s. v. Eglon) it is erroneously identified with Odollam; whereas the
situation of Agla, "at the tenth stone, as you go from Eleutheropolis to
Gaza" (Onom. s. v. Βηθαλαΐ́μ, Bethagla), suits Eglon exactly.

[Joshua 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 10:5</span></span>

These five kings marched against Gibeon and besieged the town. The king
of Jerusalem headed the expedition, as his town was so near to Gibeon
that he was the first to fear an attack from the Israelites.

[Joshua 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 10:6</span></span>

The Gibeonites then sent to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and entreated
him to come to his help as speedily as possible. "Slack not thy hand
from thy servants," i.e., withhold not thy help from us. The definition
appended to "the kings of the Amorites" ("that dwelt in the mountains")
is to be understood a potiori, and does not warrant us in drawing the
conclusion, that all the towns mentioned in [Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md) were in the mountains of Judah.
The Amorites who dwelt in the mountains were the strongest of all the
Canaanites.

[Jos 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#007.md)

In accordance with this petition Joshua advanced from Gilgal (ויּעל, not
went up) with all the people of war, even (vav expl.) all the men of
valour.

[Jos 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#008.md)

The Lord then renewed the assurance of His help in this particular war,
in which Joshua was about to fight for the first time with several
allied kings of Canaan (cf. [Jos 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#024.md);
[Jos 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#002.md); [Jos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md), [Jos
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#018).md).

[Jos 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#009.md)

Joshua came suddenly upon them (the enemy), as he had marched the whole
night from Gilgal, i.e., had accomplished the entire distance in a
night. Jiljilia is fully fifteen miles from el-Jib.

[Jos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md)

"Jehovah threw them into confusion," as He had promised in [Exo
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027.md), and in all probability, judging
from [Jos 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md), by dreadful thunder
and lightning (vid., [Sa1 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010.md); [Psa
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015.md); [Psa
144:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#006.md) : it is different in [Exo
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024).md). "Israel smote them in a great
slaughter at Gibeon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent of
Bethhoron," i.e., Upper Bethhoron (Beit Ur, el-Foka), which was nearest
to Gibeon, only four hours distant on the north-west, on a lofty
promontory between two valleys, one on the north, the other on the
south, and was separated from Lower Bethhoron, which lies further west,
by a long steep pass, from which the ascent to Upper Bethhoron is very
steep and rocky, though the rock has been cut away in many places now,
and a path made by means of steps (see Rob. Pal. iii. p. 59). This pass
between the two places leads downwards from Gibeon towards the western
plain, and was called sometimes the ascent, or going up to Bethhoron,
and sometimes the descent, or going down from it ([Jos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011).md), ἀνάβασις καὶ κατάβασις
Βαιθωρῶν (1 Macc. 3:16, 24). Israel smote the enemy still further, "to
Azekah and Makkedah:" so far were they pursued and beaten after the
battle (cf. [Jos 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#016.md), [Jos
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021).md). If we compare [Jos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md), according to which the enemy
was smitten, from Bethhoron to Azekah, by a violent fall of hail, it is
very evident that the two places were on the west of Bethhoron. And it
is in perfect harmony with this that we find both places described as
being in the lowland; Azekah in the hill-country between the mountains
and the plain ([Jos 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035).md), Makkedah
in the plain itself ([Jos 15:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#041).md).
Azekah, which was fortified by Rehoboam ([Ch2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#009).md), besieged by Nebuchadnezzar
([Jer 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007).md), and still inhabited after
the captivity ([Neh 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#030).md), was not
far from Socoh, according to [Jos
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035.md); whilst sideways between the two
was Ephes-dammim ([Sa1 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001).md). Van de
Velde has discovered the latter in the ruins of Damm, about an hour's
journey east by south from Beit Nettif (Mem. p. 290), and consequently
imagines that Azekah is to be found in the village of Ahbek, which
stands upon a lofty mountain-top a mile and a half to the north of Damm,
and about four of five miles N.N.E. of Shuweikeh, supposing this to be
Aphek. The statement in the Onom. (s. v. Ἀζηκά), ἀνάμεσον Ἐλευθεροπολεως
καὶ Αἰλίας, agrees with this. Makkedah is described in the Onom. as
being eight Roman miles to the east of Eleutheropolis, and hence Knobel
supposes it to have been near Terkumieh, or Morak; but he is wrong in
his supposition, as in that case it would have been in the hill-country
or upon the mountains, whereas it was one of the towns in the plain
([Jos 15:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#041).md). Van de Velde's
conjecture (p. 332) is a much more probable one, viz., that it is to be
found in Summeil, a considerable village on an eminence in the plain,
with a large public well 110 feet deep and 11 feet in diameter, with
strongly built walls of hewn stones, where there is also part of an old
wall, which to all appearance must formerly have belonged to a large
square castle built of uncemented stones, resembling in some respects
the oldest foundation wall of Beit Jibrin (Rob. Pal. ii. p. 368). It is
two hours and a half to the north-west of Beit Jibrin, and there Van de
Velde discovered the large cave (see at [Jos
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#016).md), which Robinson has not
observed (see his Journey through Syria and Palestine).

[Jos 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md)

The large stones which the Lord threw upon the flying foe at the slope
of Bethhoron were hail-stones (see [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030).md), not stone-hail, or a shower of
stones, but a terrible hail-storm, in which hail fell upon the foe in
pieces as large as stones (see Wis. 46:6), and slew a greater number of
them than the swords of the Israelites. This phenomenon, which resembled
the terrible hail in Egypt ([Exo
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#024).md), was manifestly a miraculous
occurrence produced by the omnipotent power of God, inasmuch as the
hail-stones slew the enemy without injuring the Israelites, who were
pursuing them. By this the Israelites were to be made to see that it was
not their own power, but the supernatural help of their God, which had
given them the victory; whilst the enemy discovered that it was not only
the people of Israel, but the God of Israel, that had devoted them to
destruction.

[Joshua 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 10:12</span></span>

In firm reliance upon the promise of God ([Jos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#008).md), Joshua offered a prayer to the
Lord during the battle, that He would not let the sun go down till
Israel had taken vengeance upon their foes; and the Lord hearkened to
the prayer of His servant, and the sun hastened not to go down till the
defeat of the Amorites was accomplished. This miraculous victory was
celebrated by the Israelites in a war-song, which was preserved in the
"book of the Righteous." The author of the book of Joshua has introduced
the passage out of this book which celebrates the mighty act of the Lord
for the glorification of His name upon Israel, and their foes the
Amorites. It is generally admitted, that [Jos
10:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md) contain a quotation from the
"book of Jasher," mentioned in [Jos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md). This quotation, and the
reference to the work itself, are analogous to the notice of "the book
of the wars of the Lord," in [Num
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014.md), and to the strophes of a song
which are there interwoven with the historical narrative; the object
being, not to confirm the historical account by referring to an earlier
source, but simply to set forth before other generations the powerful
impression which was made upon the congregation by these mighty acts of
the Lord. The "book of Jasher," i.e., book of the upright, or righteous
man, that is to say, of the true members of the theocracy, or godly men.
ישׁר (Jasher, the righteous) is used to denote the genuine Israelite, in
the same sense as in [Num 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010.md), where
Balaam calls the Israelites "the righteous," inasmuch as Jehovah, the
righteous and upright one ([Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004).md),
had called them to be His people, and to walk in His righteousness. In
addition to this passage, the "book of the righteous (Jasher)" is also
mentioned in [Sa2 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#018.md), as a work in
which was to be found David's elegy upon Saul and Jonathan. From this
fact it has been justly inferred, that the book was a collection of odes
in praise of certain heroes of the theocracy, with historical notices of
their achievements interwoven, and that the collection was formed by
degrees; so that the reference to this work is neither a proof that the
passage has been interpolated by a later hand, nor that the work was
composed at a very late period. That the passage quoted from this work
is extracted from a song is evident enough, both from the poetical form
of the composition, and also from the parallelism of the sentences. The
quotation, however, does not begin with ויּאמר (and he said) in [Jos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md), but with תּת בּיום (in the day
when the Lord delivered) in [Jos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md), and [Jos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md) and [Jos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014.md) also form part of it; so that
the title of the book from which the quotation is taken is inserted in
the middle of the quotation itself. In other cases, unquestionably, such
formulas of quotation are placed either at the beginning (as in [Num
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014.md), [Num
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027.md); [Sa2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#018).md), or else at the close of the
account, which is frequently the case in the books of Kings and
Chronicles; but it by no means follows that there were no exceptions to
this rule, especially as the reason for mentioning the original sources
is a totally different one in the books of Kings, where the works cited
are not the simple vouchers for the facts related, but works containing
fuller and more elaborate accounts of events which have only been
cursorily described. The poetical form of the passage in [Jos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md) also leaves no doubt whatever
that [Jos 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md) and [Jos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014.md) contain the words of the old
poet, and are not a prose comment made by the historian upon the
poetical passage quoted. The only purely historical statement in [Jos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#015.md); and this is repeated in [Jos
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043.md), at the close of the account of
the wars and the victory. But this literal repetition of [Jos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#015.md) in [Jos
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043.md), and the fact that the
statement, that Joshua returned with all the people to the camp at
Gilgal, anticipates the historical course of the events in a very
remarkable manner, render it highly probable, it not absolutely certain,
that [Jos 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#015.md) was also taken from
the book of the righteous.

In the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites to the children of
Israel ("before," as in [Deu 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#031.md),
[Deu 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#033), etc..md), Joshua said before
the eyes (i.e., in the presence) of Israel, so that the Israelites were
witnesses of his words (vid., [Deu
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#007)): "Sun, stand still (wait.md) at
Gibeon; and, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon." דּמם, to be silent, to keep
one's self quiet or still, to wait ([Sa1
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#009).md). The address to the sun and moon
implies that they both of them stood, or were visible in the heavens at
the time; and inasmuch as it was spoken to the Lord, involves a prayer
that the Lord and Creator of the world would not suffer the sun and moon
to set till Israel had taken vengeance upon its foes. This explanation
of the prayer is only to be found, it is true, in the statement that the
sun and moon stood still at Joshua's word; but we must imagine it as
included in the prayer itself. גּוי without an article, when used to
denote the people of Israel, is to be regarded as a poetical expression.
In the sequel ([Jos 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013).md) the sun
only is spoken of: "and the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and
hasted not to go down about a whole day." The poetical word אוּץ, to
press or hurry, is founded upon the idea that the sun runs its course
like a strong man, with vigour, and without weariness or cessation ([Psa
19:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006).md). It follows from this, that
Joshua merely prayed for the day to be lengthened, i.e., for the setting
of the sun to be delayed; and that he included the moon ([Jos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012).md), simply because it was visible
at the time. But even if this is the case, we are not therefore to
conclude, as C. v. Lapide, Clericus, and others have done, that Joshua
spoke these words in the afternoon, when the sun was beginning to set,
and the moon had already risen. The expression השּׁמים בּחצי, "in the
half," i.e., the midst, "of the sky," is opposed to this view, and still
more the relative position of the two in the sky, the sun at Gibeon and
the moon in the valley of Ajalon, i.e., in the fine broad basin on the
north side of Yalo (see at [Jos
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#042).md), the present Merj Ibn Omeir
(Rob. iii. p. 63, 64), which is four hours' journey to the west of
Gibeon. As Joshua smote the enemy at Gibeon, and they fled to the
south-west, he was not doubt on the west of Gibeon when he commanded the
sun and moon to stand still; and therefore from his point of view the
sun would be in the east when it stood over Gibeon, and the moon in the
far west when it stood over the valley of Ajalon. But that could only be
the case before noon, a few hours after sunrise, when the moon had not
yet set in the western sky. In all probability the battle took place
quite early in the morning, as Joshua had marched from Gilgal the night
before, and fell quite suddenly upon the enemy ([Jos
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#009).md). But after the conflict had
lasted for some hours, and Joshua began to be anxious lest he should be
unable to overcome the enemy before night came on, he addressed the
prayer to the Lord to lengthen out the day, and in a short time saw his
prayer so far fulfilled, that the sun still stood high up in the sky
when the enemy was put to flight. We take for granted that these words
were spoken by Joshua before the terrible hail-storm which fell upon the
enemy in their flight, when they were near Bethhoron, which is about two
hours from Gibeon, and smote them to Azekah. There is nothing to prevent
our assuming this. The fact, that in the historical account the hail is
mentioned before the desire expressed by Joshua and the fulfilment of
that desire, may be explained on the simple ground, that the historian,
following the order of importance, relates the principal incident in
connection with the battle first, before proceeding to the special point
to be cited from the book of the righteous. תמים כּיום, "towards (about,
or as it were) a whole day," neither signifies "when the day was ended"
(Clericus), nor "as it usually does when the day is perfected or
absolutely finished" (Rosenmller); but the sun did not hasten or press
to go down, delayed its setting, almost a whole day ("day" being the
time between sunrise and sunset).

What conception are we to form of this miraculous event? It is not
stated that the sun actually stood still in one spot in the heavens-say,
for instance, in the zenith. And if the expression, "the sun stood still
in the midst of heaven," which is added as an explanation of ויּדּום, is
so pressed as to mean that the sun as miraculously stopped in its
course, this is hardly reconcilable with לבוא אץ לא, "it hasted not to
go down," as these words, if taken literally, merely denote a slower
motion on the part of the sun, as many of the Rabbins have observed. All
that is clearly affirmed in [Jos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md)
and [Jos 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md) is, that at Joshua's
word the sun remained standing in the sky for almost a whole day longer.
To this there is added, in [Jos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014.md),
"There was no day like that before it, or after it, that Jehovah
hearkened to the voice of a man; for Jehovah fought for Israel." This
expression must not be pressed too far, as the analogous passages
("there was none like him," etc.) in [Kg2
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#005.md) and [Kg2
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#025.md) clearly show. They merely
express this thought: no other day like this, which God so miraculously
lengthened, ever occurred either before or afterwards. So much,
therefore, is obvious enough from the words, that the writer of the old
song, and also the author of the book of Joshua, who inserted the
passage in his narrative, were convinced that the day was miraculously
prolonged. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that it is not
stated that God lengthened that day at the request of Joshua almost an
entire day, or that He made the sun stand still almost a whole day, but
simply that God hearkened to the voice of Joshua, i.e., did not permit
the sun to go down till Israel had avenged itself upon its enemies. This
distinction is not without importance: for a miraculous prolongation of
the day would take place not only if the sun's course or sun's setting
was delayed for several hours by the omnipotent power of God, and the
day extended from twelve to eighteen or twenty hours, but also if the
day seemed to Joshua and all Israel to be miraculously prolonged;
because the work accomplished on that day was so great, that it would
have required almost two days to accomplish it without supernatural aid.
It is not easy to decide between these two opposite views; in fact, it
is quite impossible if we go to the root of the matter. When we are not
in circumstances to measure the length of the day by the clock, it is
very easy to mistake its actual length, especially in the midst of the
pressure of business or work. The Israelites at that time had neither
sun-clocks nor any other kind of clock; and during the confusion of the
battle it is hardly likely that Joshua, or any one else who was engaged
in the conflict, would watch the shadow of the sun and its changes,
either by a tree or any other object, so as to discover that the sun had
actually stood still, from the fact that for hours the shadow had
neither moved nor altered in length. Under such circumstances,
therefore, it was quite impossible for the Israelites to decide whether
it was in reality, or only in their own imagination, that the day was
longer than others. To this there must be added the poetical character
of the verses before us. When David celebrates the miraculous
deliverance which he had received from the Lord, in these words, "In my
distress I called upon the Lord ... . He heard my voice out of His
temple ... . He bowed the heavens also, and came down ... . He sent from
above, He took me, He grew me out of many waters" ([Psa
18:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007).md), who would ever think of
interpreting the words literally, and supposing them to mean that God
actually came down from the sky, and stretched out His hand to draw
David out of the water? Or who would understand the words of Deborah,
"They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses fought against
Sisera" ([Jdg 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#020).md), in their literal
sense? The truthfulness of such utterances is to be sought for in the
subjective sphere of religious intuition, and not in a literal
interpretation of the words. And it may be just the same with these
verses, without their actual contents being affected, if the day was
merely subjectively lengthened, - that is to say, in the religious
conviction of the Israelites. But even if the words really affirmed that
a miraculous and objective lengthening of the day did actually take
place, we should have no reason whatever for questioning the credibility
of the statement.

All the objections that have been raised with reference to the reality
or possibility of such a miracle, prove to have no force when we examine
the subject more closely. Thus, for example, the objection that the
annals of the other nations of the earth contain no account of any such
miracle, which must have extended over the whole world, loses all its
significance from the simple fact that there are no annals in existence
belonging to other nations and reaching back to that time, and that it
is altogether doubtful whether the miracle would extend far beyond the
limits of Palestine. Again, an appeal to the unchangeableness of the
motions of the stars according to eternal and unchangeable laws, is not
adapted to prove the impossibility of such a miracle. The eternal laws
of nature are nothing more than phenomena, or forms of manifestation, of
those divine creative powers, the true character of which no mortal has
ever fathomed. And does not the almighty Creator and Upholder of nature
and all its forces possess the power so to direct and govern the working
of these forces, as to make them subservient to the realization of His
purposes of salvation? And lastly, the objection that a sudden stoppage
of the revolution of the earth upon its axis would have dashed to pieces
all the works of human hands that were to be found upon its surface, and
hurled the earth itself, with its satellite the moon, out of their
orbits, cannot prove anything, because it leaves out of sight the fact
that the omnipotent hand of God, which not only created the stars, but
gave them the power to revolve with such regularity in their orbits as
long as this universe endures, and which upholds and governs all things
in heaven and on earth, is not too short to guard against any such
disastrous consequences as these. But to this we may add, that even the
strictest and most literal interpretation of the words does not require
us to assume, as the fathers and earlier theologians did, that the sun
itself was miraculously made to stand still, but simply supposes an
optical stopping of the sun in its course, - that is to say, a
miraculous suspension of the revolution of the earth upon its axis,
which would make it appear to the eye of an observer as if the sun
itself were standing still. Knobel is by no means warranted in
pronouncing this view of the matter an assumption at variance with the
text. For the Scriptures speak of the things of the visible world as
they appear; just as we speak of the sun as rising and setting, although
we have no doubt whatever about the revolution of the earth. Moreover,
the omnipotence of God might produce such an optical stoppage of the
sun, or rather a continuance of the visibility of the sun above the
horizon, by celestial phenomena which are altogether unknown to us or to
naturalists in general, without interfering with the general laws
affecting the revolution of the heavenly bodies. Only we must not
attempt, as some have done, to reduce the whole miracle of divine
omnipotence to an unusual refraction of the light, or to the continuance
of lightning throughout the whole night.

[Joshua 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 10:16</span></span>

The five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave that was a Makkedah.
When they were discovered there, Joshua ordered large stones to be
rolled before the entrance to the cave, and men to be placed there to
watch, whilst the others pursued the enemy without ceasing, and smote
their rear (vid., [Deu 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#018).md), and
prevented their entering into their cities. He himself remained at
Makkedah ([Jos 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021).md).

[Joshua 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 10:20</span></span>

When the great battle and the pursuit of the enemy were ended, and such
as remained had reached their fortified towns, the people returned to
the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace, i.e., without being attacked by
anybody. "There pointed not (a dog) its tongue against the sons of
Israel, against any one" (see at [Exo
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007).md). לאישׁ is in apposition to
ישׂראל לבני, and serves to define it more precisely. It is possible,
however, to regard the ל as a copyist's error, as Houbigant and Maurer
do, in which case אישׁ would be the nominative to the verb.

[Joshua 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 10:22</span></span>

Joshua then commanded the five kings to be fetched out of the cave, and
directed the leaders of the army to set their feet upon the necks of the
kings; and when this had been done, he ordered the kings to be put to
death, and to be hanged upon trees until the evening, when their bodies
were to be thrown into the cave in which they had concealed themselves.
Of course this did not take place till the day after the battle, as the
army could not return from their pursuit of the foe to the camp at
Makkedah till the night after the battle; possibly it did not take place
till the second day, if the pursuit had lasted any longer. In [Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md), "all the men of Israel" are all
the warriors in the camp. ההלכוּא, with ה artic., instead of the
relative pronoun (see Ges. 109; Ew. 331, b.); and the ending וּא for וּ
or וּן, as in [Isa 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012.md) (see Ew. 190,
b.). The fact that the military leaders set their feet at Joshua's
command upon the necks of the conquered kings, was not a sign of
barbarity, which it is necessary to excuse by comparing it with still
greater barbarities on the part of the Canaanites, as in [Jdg
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007.md), but was a symbolical act, a sign
of complete subjugation, which was customary in this sense even in the
Eastern empire (see Bynaeus de calceis, p. 318, and Constant.
Porphyrogen de cerimon. aulae Byzant. ii. 19). It was also intended in
this instance to stimulate the Israelites to further conflict with the
Canaanites. This is stated in the words of Joshua ([Jos
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#025).md): "Fear not, nor be dismayed
(vid., [Jos 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#009.md); [Jos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001).md); for thus shall the Lord do to
all your enemies." On the putting to death and then hanging, see [Jos
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029.md) and [Deu
21:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#022.md). The words וגו ויּשׂימוּ
([Jos 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#027).md) are generally understood
as signifying, that after the bodies of the kings had been cast into the
cave, the Israelites placed large stones before the entrance, just as in
other cases heaps of stones were piled upon the graves of criminals that
had been executed (vid., [Jos 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025).md),
and that these stones remained there till the account before us was
written. But this leaves the words עצם עד unexplained, as עצם never
occurs in any other case where the formula "until this day" is used with
the simple meaning that a thing had continued to the writer's own time.
הזּה היּום עצם expresses the thought that the day referred to was the
very same day about which the author was writing, and no other (see [Jos
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#011.md); [Gen
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#013.md); [Gen
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#023.md); [Exo
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#017), etc..md). If, therefore, it has
any meaning at all in the present instance, we must connect the whole
clause with the one preceding, and even construe it as a relative
clause: "where they (the kings) had hidden themselves, and they (the
Israelites) had placed large stones at the mouth of the cave until that
very day" (on which the kings were fetched out and executed).

[Joshua 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jos 10:28</span></span>

Further prosecution of the victory, by the conquest of the fortified
towns of the south, into which those who escaped the sword of the
Israelites had thrown themselves.

[Jos 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md)

On the same day on which the five kings were impaled, Joshua took
Makkedah (see at [Jos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010).md), and
smote the town and its king with the edge of the sword, banning the town
and all the persons in it, i.e., putting all the inhabitants to death
(many MSS and some editions adopt the reading אתהּ for אתם, as in [Jos
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#037).md), taking the cattle and the
property in the town as booty, as in the case of Ai ([Jos
8:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#027).md), and treating its king like
the king of Jericho, who was suspended upon a stake, to judge from [Jos
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#002.md), [Jos
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029.md), although this is not stated in
Josh 6.

[Jos 10:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029.md)

From Makkedah he went with all Israel, i.e., all the men of war, against
Libnah, and after effecting the conquest of it, did just the same as he
had done to Makkedah. Libnah was one of the towns of the plain or of the
hill-country of Judah ([Jos 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042).md); it
was allotted to the priests ([Jos
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013).md), revolted from Judah in the
reign of Joram ([Kg2 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#022).md), and was
besieged by Sennacherib ([Isa 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#008).md).
It is to be sought on the north-west of Lachish, not on the south as
Knobel erroneously infers from [Isa
37:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#008.md). According to the Onom. (s. v.
Lebna), it was at that time villa in regione Eleutheropolitana, quae
appellatur Lobna. It has not been discovered yet; but according to the
very probable conjecture of V. de Velde (Mem. p. 330), the ruins of it
may perhaps be seen upon the hill called Ark el Menshiyeh, about two
hours to the wets of Beit Jibrin.

(Note: Knobel is decidedly wrong in his supposition, that Libnah is to
be seen in the considerable ruins called Hora, which lie in the plain
(Seetzen and V. de Velde) and are called Hawara by Robinson. He founds
his conjecture upon the fact that the name signifies white, and is the
Arabic translation of the Hebrew name. But Hora is only two hours and a
half to the north of Beersheba, and is not in the plain at all, but in
the Negeb.)

[Jos 10:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#031.md)

Lachish, i.e., Um Lakis (see at [Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003).md), shared the same fate.

[Jos 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033.md)

Joshua also smote the king of Gezer, who had come with his people to
help of Lachish, and left no one remaining. Nothing is said about the
capture of the town of Gezer. According to [Jos
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010.md) and [Jdg
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#029.md), it was still in the possession
of the Canaanites when the land was divided, though this alone is not
sufficient to prove that Joshua did not conquer it, as so many of the
conquered towns were occupied by the Canaanites again after the
Israelites had withdrawn. But its situation makes it very probable that
Joshua did not conquer it at that time, as it was too much out of his
road, and too far from Lachish. Gezer (lxx Γάζερ, in [Ch1
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#016.md) Γαζηρά, in 1 Macc. Γαζήρα or
Γάζαρα plur., in Josephus Γάζαρα, Ant. vii. 4, 1, viii. 6, 1, and also
Γάδαρα, v. 1, 22, xii. 7, 4) was on the southern boundary of Ephraim
([Jos 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003).md), and was given up by that
tribe to the Levites ([Jos 16:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#009.md);
[Jos 21:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#020.md). It is very frequently
mentioned. David pursued the Philistines to Gezer (Gazer), after they
had been defeated at Gibeon or Geba ([Sa2
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#025.md); [Ch1
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#016).md). At a later period it was
conquered by Pharaoh, and presented to his daughter, who was married to
Solomon; and Solomon built, i.e., fortified it ([Kg1
9:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#016).md). It was an important fortress
in the wars of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 9:52; 2 Macc. 10:32; cf. 1 Macc.
4:15; 7:45; 13:53; 14:34; 15:28, 35). According to the Onom. (s. v.
Gazer), it was four Roman miles to the north of Nicopolis, i.e., Anwas,
and was called Γαζάρα. This is not only in harmony with [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md), according to which the southern
border of Ephraim ran from Lower Bethhoron to Gezer, and then on to the
sea, but also with all the other passages in which Gezer is mentioned,

(Note: The statement in 1 Macc. 7:45, that Judas Maccabaeus pursued the
army of Nicanor, which had been beaten at Adasa, for a day's journey, as
far as Gazera ("a day's journey from Adasa into Gazera"), is perfectly
reconcilable with the situation of el Kubab; for, according to Josephus
(Ant. xii. 10, 5), Adasa was thirty stadia from Bethhoron, and Bethhoron
is ten miles to the west of Jubab (measuring in a straight line upon the
map); so that Judas pursued the enemy fifteen miles - a distance which
might very well be called "a day's journey," if we consider that the
enemy, when flying, would not always take the straightest road, and
might even make a stand at intervals, and so delay their pursuers. Still
less do the statement in 1 Macc. 14:34, that Simon fortified Joppa on
the sea, and Gazara on the border of Ashdod, the combination of Joppa,
Gazara, and the tower that is in Jerusalem (1 Macc. 15:28, 35), and the
fact that the country of Gadaris, with the town of Gadara, occurs
between Joppa and Jamnia in Strabo xvi. 759, warrant us in making a
distinction between Gazara (Gezer) and the place mentioned in the Onom.,
as Grimm does (on 1 Macc. 4:15), and identifying it with the village of
Jazr, an hour and a half from Jaffa, although Arvieux calls this village
Gesser. The objections of Van de Velde against the identity of Jubab and
Gazer are without any force. It does not necessarily follow from the
expression "went up," that Lachish stood on higher ground than Gezer, as
going up often signifies nothing more than making a hostile attack upon
a fortification. And no importance can be attached to the conjecture,
that with the great distance of Jubab from Um Lakis, the king of Gezer
would have come to the help of the kings of Makkedah and Libnah, who
were much nearer and were attacked first, as the circumstances which
determined his conduct are too thoroughly unknown to us, for it to be
possible to pronounce an opinion upon the subject with any certainty.)

and answers very well to the situation of El Kubab, a village of
considerable size on a steep hill at the extreme north of the mountain
chain which runs to the north-west of Zorea, and slopes off towards the
north into the broad plain of Merj el Omeir, almost in the middle of the
road from Ramleh to Yalo. For this village, with which Van Semden
identifies Gezer (Van de Velde, Mem. p. 315), was exactly four Roman
miles north by west of Anwas, according to Robinson's map, and not quite
four hours from Akir (Ekron), the most northerly city of the
Philistines; so that Josephus (Ant. vii. 4, 1) could very properly
describe Gazara as the frontier of the territory of the Philistines.
Robinson discovered no signs of antiquity, it is true, on his journey
through Kubab, but in all probability he did not look for them, as he
did not regard the village as a place of any importance in connection
with ancient history (Bibl. Res. pp. 143-4).

[Jos 10:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#034.md)

From Lachish Joshua proceeded eastwards against Eglon (Ajlan, see [Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003).md), took the town, and did to it as
he had done to Lachish.

[Jos 10:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#036.md)

From Eglon he went up from the lowland to the mountains, attacked Hebron
and took it, and did to this town and its king, and the towns belonging
to it, as he had already done to the others. The king of Hebron cannot
of course be the one who was taken in the cave of Makkedah and put to
death there, but his successor, who had entered upon the government
while Joshua was occupied with the conquest of the towns mentioned in
[Jos 10:28-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md), which may possibly have
taken more than a year. "All the cities thereof" are the towns dependent
upon Hebron as the capital of the kingdom.

[Jos 10:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#038.md)

Joshua then turned southwards with all Israel (i.e., all the army),
attacked Debir and took it, and the towns dependent upon it, in the same
manner as those mentioned before. Debir, formerly called Kirjath-sepher,
i.e., book town, πόλις γραμμάτων (lxx [Jos
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#015.md); [Jdg
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#011).md), and Kirjath-sanna, i.e., in all
probability the city of palm branches ([Jos
15:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#049).md), was given up by Judah to the
priests ([Jos 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#015).md). It stood upon
the mountains of Judah ([Jos 15:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#049).md),
to the south of Hebron, but has not yet been certainly discovered,
though V. de Velde is probably correct in his supposition that it is to
be seen in the ruins of Dilbeh, on the peak of a hill to the north of
Wady Dilbeh, and on the road from Dhoberiyeh to Hebron, about two hours
to the south-west of the latter. For, according to Dr. Stewart, there is
a spring at Dilbeh, the water of which is conducted by an aqueduct into
the Birket el Dilbeh, at the foot of the said hill, which would answer
very well to the upper and lower springs at Debir, if only Debir might
be placed, according to [Jos 15:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#049.md), so
far towards the north.

(Note: Knobel imagines that Debir is to be found in the modern village
of Dhoberiyeh (Dhabarije), five hours to the south-west of Hebron, on
the south-west border of the mountains of Judah, upon the top of a
mountain, because, in addition to the situation of this village, which
is perfectly reconcilable with [Jos
15:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#049.md), there are remains of a square
tower there (according to Krafft, a Roman tower), which point to an
ancient fortification (vid., Rob. Pal. i. pp. 308ff.; Ritter, Erdk. xvi.
pp. 202ff.), and because the name, which signifies "placed behind the
back," agrees with Debir, the hinder part or back (?), and
Kirjath-sepher, if interpreted by the Arabic words, which signify
"extremitas, margo, ora." But both reasons prove very little. The
meanings assigned to Debir and Kirjath-sepher are improbable and
arbitrary. Moreover, it has not been shown that there are any springs
near Dhoberiyeh, such as there were in the neighbourhood of Debir ([Jos
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#019)..md). The view held by Rosenmller,
and adopted by Bunsen, with regard to the situation of Debir, - namely,
that it was the same as the modern Idwirbn or Dewirbn, an hour and a
quarter to the west of Hebron, because there is a large spring there
with an abundant supply of excellent water, which goes by the name of
Ain Nunkr, - is also quite untenable; for it is entirely at variance
with [Jos 15:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#049.md), according to which
Debir was not on the west of Hebron, but upon the mountains to the
south, and rests entirely upon the erroneous assumption that, according
to [Jos 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#038.md) (ויּשׁב, he turned
round), as Joshua came from Eglon, he conquered Hebron first, and after
the conquest of this town turned back to Debir, to take it also. But
שׁוּב, does not mean only to turn round or turn back: it signifies
turning generally; and it is very evident that this is the sense in
which it is used in [Jos 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#038.md), since,
according to [Jos 15:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#049.md), Debir was on
the south of Hebron.)

Moreover, not very long afterwards, probably during the time when the
Israelites were occupied with the subjugation of northern Canaan, Hebron
and Debir were taken again by the Canaanites, particularly the Anakites,
as Joshua had not entirely destroyed them, although he had thoroughly
cleared the mountains of Judah of them, but had left them still in the
towns of the Philistines ([Jos
11:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#021).md). Consequently, when the land
was divided, there were Anakites living in both Hebron and Debir; so
that Caleb, to whom these towns were given as his inheritance, had first
of all to conquer them again, and to exterminate the Anakites ([Jos
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012.md); [Jos
15:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md) : cf. [Jdg
1:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#010).md).

(Note: By this simple assumption we get rid of the pretended
contradictions, which neological critics have discovered between [Jos
10:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#036.md) on the one hand, and [Jos
11:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#021.md), and [Jos
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012.md); [Jos
15:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md) on the other, and on account
of which Knobel would assign the passages last named to a different
document. On the first conquest of the land by Joshua, Masius observes
that "in this expedition Joshua ran through the southern region with an
armed band, in too hurried a manner to depopulate it entirely. All that
he needed was to strike such terror into the hearts of all through his
victories, that no one should henceforth offer any resistance to himself
and to the people of God. Those whom he pursued, therefore, he destroyed
according to the commands of God, not sparing a single one, but he did
not search out every possible hiding-place in which any could be
concealed. This was left as a gleaning to the valour of each particular
tribe, when it should take possession of its own inheritance.")

Summary of the Conquest of the Whole of Southern Canaan. - In the
further prosecution of his victory over the five allied kings, Joshua
smote the whole land, i.e., the whole of the south of Canaan from Gibeon
onwards, in all its districts, namely the mountains ([Jos
15:48](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048).md), the Negeb (the south land,
[Jos 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021).md), the lowlands ([Jos
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033).md), and the slopes, i.e., the hill
region ([Jos 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#008.md), and comm. on [Num
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015).md), and all the kings of these
different districts, banning every living thing (כּל־נשׁמה = כּל־נפשׁ,
[Jos 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md), [Jos
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#030.md), i.e., all the men; vid., [Deu
7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md); [Deu
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#016.md). He smote them from
Kadesh-barnea, on the southern boundary of Canaan ([Jos
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#003.md); see at [Num
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016).md), to Gaza (see at [Gen
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#009).md), and all the country of Goshen,
a different place from the Goshen of Egypt, deriving its name in all
probability from the town of Goshen on the southern portion of the
mountains ([Jos 15:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#051).md). As the line
"from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza" defines the extent of the conquered country
from south to north on the western side, so the parallel clause, "all
the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon," defines the extent from south
to north on the eastern side. There is no tenable ground for the view
expressed by Knobel, which rests upon very uncertain etymological
combinations, that the land of Goshen signifies the hill country between
the mountains and the plain, and is equivalent to אשׁדות.

All these kings and their country Joshua took "once," i.e., in one
campaign, which lasted, however, a considerable time (cf. [Jos
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#018).md). He was able to accomplish
this, because Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel (see [Jos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014).md). After this he returned with
the army to the camp at Gilgal (Jiljilia; cf. [Jos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#015).md).
