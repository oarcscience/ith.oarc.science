De Profundis

Luther, being once asked which were the best Psalms, replied, Psalmi
Paulini; and when his companions at table pressed him to say which these
were, he answered: [Psa 32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001); Ps
51; [Psa 130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001), and [Psa
143:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001). In fact in [Psa
130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001) the condemnability of the
natural man, the freeness of mercy, and the spiritual nature of
redemption are expressed in a manner thoroughly Pauline. It is the sixth
among the seven Psalmi poenitentiales ([Psa
6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001), [Psa
32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001), Ps 38, Ps 51, Ps 102, [Psa
130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001), [Psa
143:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001)).

Even the chronicler had this Psalm before him in the present
classification, which puts it near to Ps 132; for the independent
addition with which he enriches Solomon's prayer at the dedication of
the Temple, [Ch2 6:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#040), is compiled
out of passages of [Psa 130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001) ([Psa
130:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#002), cf. the divine response, [Ch2
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#015)) and Ps 132 ([Psa
132:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008), [Psa
132:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#016), [Psa
132:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010)).

The mutual relation of [Psa 130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001) to
Ps 86 has been already noticed there. The two Psalms are first attempts
at adding a third, Adonajic style to the Jehovic and Elohimic
Psalm-style. There Adonaj is repeated seven times, and three times in
this Psalm. There are also other indications that the writer of [Psa
130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001) was acquainted with that Ps 86
(compare [Psa 130:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#002), שׁמעה בקולי, with
[Psa 86:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#006), והקשׁיבה בּקול; [Psa
130:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#002), לקול תּחנוּני, with [Psa
86:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#006), בּקול תּחנוּנותי; [Psa
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004), עמּך הסּליחה, with [Psa
86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005), וסלּח; [Psa
130:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#008), החסד עם ה/ הח, with [Psa
86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005), [Psa
86:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#015), רב־חסד). The fact that קשּׁוּב
(after the form שׁכּוּל), occurs besides only in those dependent
passages of the chronicler, and קשּׁב only in [Neh
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#006), [Neh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011), as סליחה besides only in [Dan
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#009); [Neh
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017), brings our Psalm down into a
later period of the language; and moreover Ps 86 is not Davidic.

[Psalms 130:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 130:1</span></span>

The depths (מעמקּים) are not the depths of the soul, but the deep
outward and inward distress in which the poet is sunk as in deep waters
([Psa 69:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#003), [Psa
69:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#015)). Out of these depths he cries
to the God of salvation, and importunately prays Him who rules all
things and can do all things to grant him a compliant hearing (שׁמע בּ,
[Gen 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012); [Gen
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#013); [Gen
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#006), and other passages). God heard
indeed even in Himself, as being the omniscient One, the softest and
most secret as well as the loudest utterance; but, as Hilary observes,
fides officium suum exsequitur, ut Dei auditionem roget, ut qui per
naturam suam audit per orantis precem dignetur audire. In this sense the
poet prays that His ears may be turned קשּׁבות (duller collateral form
of קשּׁב, to be in the condition of arrectae aures), with strained
attention, to his loud and urgent petition ([Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002)). His life hangs upon the thread
of the divine compassion. If God preserves iniquities, who can stand
before Him?! He preserves them (שׁמר) when He puts them down to one
([Psa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002)) and keeps them in
remembrance ([Gen 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#011)), or, as it is
figuratively expressed in [Job 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017),
sealed up as it were in custody in order to punish them when the measure
is full. The inevitable consequence of this is the destruction of the
sinner, for nothing can stand against the punitive justice of God ([Nah
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006); [Mal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002); [Ezr
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#015)). If God should show Himself as
Jāh,

(Note: Eusebius on Ps 68 (67):5 observes that the Logos is called Ἴα as
μορφὴν δούλον λαβὼν καὶ τάς ἀκτῖνας τῆς ἑαυτοῦ θεότητος συστείλας καὶ
ὥσπερ καταδὺς ἐν τῷ σώματι. There is a similar passage in Vicentius
Ciconia (1567), which we introduced into our larger Commentary on the
Psalms (1859-60).)

no creature would be able to stand before Him, who is Adonaj, and can
therefore carry out His judicial will or purpose ([Isa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016)). He does not, however, act
thus. He does not proceed according to the legal stringency of
recompensative justice. This thought, which fills up the pause after the
question, but is not directly expressed, is confirmed by the following
כּי, which therefore, as in [Job 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002);
[Job 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#018); [Job
39:14](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#014); [Isa
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028) (cf. [Ecc
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006)), introduces the opposite. With
the Lord is the willingness to forgive (הסּליחה), in order that He may
be feared; i.e., He forgives, as it is expressed elsewhere (e.g., [Psa
79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009)), for His Name's sake: He seeks
therein the glorifying of His Name. He will, as the sole Author of our
salvation, who, putting all vain-glorying to shame, causes mercy instead
of justice to take its course with us (cf. [Psa
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006)), be reverenced; and gives the
sinner occasion, ground, and material for reverential thanksgiving and
praise by bestowing "forgiveness" upon him in the plenitude of
absolutely free grace.

[Psalms 130:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 130:5</span></span>

Therefore the sinner need not, therefore too the poet will not, despair.
He hopes in Jahve (acc. obj. as in [Psa
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005), [Psa
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#021); [Psa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002)), his soul hopes; hoping in and
waiting upon God is the mood of his inmost and of his whole being. He
waits upon God's word, the word of His salvation ([Psa
119:81](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081)), which, if it penetrates into
the soul and cleaves there, calms all unrest, and by the appropriated
consolation of forgiveness transforms and enlightens for it everything
in it and outside of it. His soul is לאדני, i.e., stedfastly and
continually directed towards Him; as Chr. A. Crusius when on his
death-bed, with hands and eyes uplifted to heaven, joyfully exclaimed:
"My soul is full of the mercy of Jesus Christ. My whole soul is towards
God." The meaning of לאדני becomes at once clear in itself from [Psa
143:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#006), and is defined moreover,
without supplying שׁמרת (Hitzig), according to the following לבּקר.
Towards the Lord he is expectantly turned, like those who in the
night-time wait for the morning. The repetition of the expression "those
who watch for the morning" (cf. [Isa
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011)) gives the impression of
protracted, painful waiting. The wrath, in the sphere of which the poet
now finds himself, is a nightly darkness, out of which he wishes to be
removed into the sunny realm of love ([Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002)); not he alone, however, but at
the same time all Israel, whose need is the same, and for whom therefore
believing waiting is likewise the way to salvation. With Jahve, and with
Him exclusively, with Him, however, also in all its fulness, is החסד
(contrary to Ps 62:13, without any pausal change in accordance with the
varying of the segolates), the mercy, which removes the guilt of sin and
its consequences, and puts freedom, peace, and joy into the heart. And
plenteous (הרבּה, an adverbial infin. absol., used here, as in [Eze
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#020), as an adjective) is with Him
redemption; i.e., He possesses in the richest measure the willingness,
the power, and the wisdom, which are needed to procure redemption, which
rises up as a wall of partition ([Exo
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019)) between destruction and those
imperilled. To Him, therefore, must the individual, if he will obtain
mercy, to Him must His people, look up hopingly; and this hope directed
to Him shall not be put to shame: He, in the fulness of the might of His
free grace ([Isa 43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025)), will redeem
Israel from all its iniquities, by forgiving them and removing their
unhappy inward and outward consequences. With this promise (cf. [Psa
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#022)) the poet comforts himself. He
means complete and final redemption, above all, in the genuinely New
Testament manner, spiritual redemption.
