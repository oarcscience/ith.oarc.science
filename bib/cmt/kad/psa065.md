Thanksgiving Song for Victory and Blessings Bestowed

In this Psalm, the placing of which immediatley after the preceding is
at once explicable by reason of the ויּיראוּ so prominent in both ([Psa
64:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#010.md); [Psa
65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009).md), we come upon the same
intermingling of the natural and the historical as in [Psa
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001.md); [Psa
19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md); [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md). The congregation gathered
around the sanctuary on Zion praises its God, by whose mercy its
imperilled position in relation to other nations has been rescued, and
by whose goodness it again finds itself at peace, surrounded by fields
rich in promise. In addition to the blessing which it has received in
the bounties of nature, it does not lose sight of the answer to prayer
which it has experienced in its relation to the world of nations. His
rule in human history and His rule in nature are, to the church,
reflected the one in the other. In the latter, as in the former, it sees
the almighty and bountiful hand of Him who answers prayer and expiates
sins, and through judgment opens up a way for His love. The deliverance
which it has experienced redounds to the acknowledgment of the God of
its salvation among the most distant peoples; the beneficial results of
Jahve's interposition in the events transpiring in the world extend
temporally as well as spiritually far beyond the bounds of Israel; it is
therefore apparently the relief of Israel and of the peoples in general
from the oppression of some worldly power that is referred to. The
spring of the third year spoken of in [Isa
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#030.md), when to Judah the overthrow of
Assyria was a thing of the past, and they again had the fields ripening
for the harvest before their eyes, offers the most appropriate
historical basis for the twofold purport of the Psalm. The inscription,
To the Precentor, a Psalm, by David, a song (cf. [Psa
75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md); [Psa
76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001).md), does not mislead us in this
matter. For even we regard it as uncritical to assign to David all the
Psalms bearing the inscription לדוד. The Psalm in many MSS
(Complutensian, Vulgate), beside the words Εἰς τὸ τέλος ψαλμός τῷ Δαυίδ
ᾠδὴ, has the addition ᾠδὴ Ἱιερεμίου καὶ Ἰεζεκιὴλ, (ἐκ) τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς
παροικίας ὄτε ἔμελλον ἐκπορεύεσθαι. At the head of the following Psalm
it might have some meaning - here, however, it has none.

[Psalms 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 65:1</span></span>

The praise of God on account of the mercy with which He rules out of
Zion. The lxx renders σοὶ πρέπει ὕμνος, but דּומיּה, tibi par est, h. e.
convenit laus (Ewald), is not a usage of the language (cf. [Psa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001.md); [Jer
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007).md). דּמיּה signifies, according to
[Psa 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003.md), silence, and as an ethical
notion, resignation, [Psa 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md).
According to the position of the words it looks like the subject, and
תּהלּה like the predicate. The accents at least (Illuj, Shalsheleth)
assume the relationship of the one word to the other to be that of
predicate and subject; consequently it is not: To Thee belongeth
resignation, praise (Hengstenberg), but: To Thee is resignation praise,
i.e., resignation is (given or presented) to Thee as praise. Hitzig
obtains the same meaning by an alteration of the text: לך דמיה תהלּל;
but opposed to this is the fact that הלּל ל is not found anywhere in the
Psalter, but only in the writings of the chronicler. And since it is
clear that the words לך תהלה belong together ([Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004).md), the poet had no need to fear
any ambiguity when he inserted dmyh between them as that which is given
to God as praise in Zion. What is intended is that submission or
resignation to God which gives up its cause to God and allows Him to act
on its behalf, renouncing all impatient meddling and interference ([Exo
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#014).md). The second member of the
sentence affirms that this praise of pious resignation does not remain
unanswered. Just as God in Zion is praised by prayer which resigns our
own will silently to His, so also to Him are vows paid when He fulfils
such prayer. That the answers to prayer are evidently thought of in
connection with this, we see from [Psa
65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003.md), where God is addressed as the
"Hearer or Answerer of prayer." To Him as being the Hearer and Answerer
of prayer all flesh comes, and in fact, as עדיך implies (cf. [Isa
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024).md), without finding help anywhere
else, it clear a way for itself until it gets to Him; i.e., men,
absolutely dependent, impotent in themselves and helpless, both
collectively and individually (those only excepted who are determined to
perish or despair), flee to Him as their final refuge and help. Before
all else it is the prayer for the forgiveness of sin which He graciously
answers. The perfect in [Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004.md) is
followed by the future in [Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004.md).
The former, in accordance with the sense, forms a hypothetical protasis:
granted that the instances of faults have been too powerful for me,
i.e., (cf. [Gen 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013).md) an intolerable
burden to me, our transgressions are expiated by Thee (who alone canst
and also art willing to do it). דּברי is not less significant than in
[Psa 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020.md); [Psa
105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027.md); [Psa
145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005.md), cf. [Sa1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002.md); [Sa2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#018.md).: it separates the general fact
into its separate instances and circumstances. How blessed therefore is
the lot of that man whom (supply אשׁר) God chooses and brings near,
i.e., removes into His vicinity, that he may inhabit His courts (future
with the force of a clause expressing a purpose, as e.g., in [Job
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#028), which see.md), i.e., that there,
where He sits enthroned and reveals Himself, he may have his true home
and be as if at home (vid., [Psa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001).md)! The congregation gathered
around Zion is esteemed worthy of this distinction among the nations of
the earth; it therefore encourages itself in the blessed consciousness
of this its privilege flowing from free grace (בחר), to enjoy in full
draughts (שּבע with בּ as in [Psa
103:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005).md) the abundant goodness or
blessing (טוּב) of God's house, of the holy (ἅγιον) of His temple, i.e.,
of His holy temple (קדשׁ as in [Psa
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md), cf. [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015).md). For for all that God's grace
offers us we can give Him no better thanks than to hunger and thirst
after it, and satisfy our poor soul therewith.

[Psalms 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 65:5</span></span>

The praise of God on account of the lovingkindness which Israel as a
people among the peoples has experienced. The future תּעננוּ confesses,
as a present, a fact of experience that still holds good in all times to
come. נוראות might, according to [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md), as in [Psa
139:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014.md), be an accusative of the more
exact definition; but why not, according to [Sa1
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#010.md); [Job
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#003.md), a second accusative under the
government of the verb? God answers the prayer of His people
superabundantly. He replies to it גוראות, terrible deeds, viz., בּצדק,
by a rule which stringently executes the will of His righteousness
(vid., on [Jer 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#006).md); in this instance
against the oppressors of His people, so that henceforth everywhere upon
earth He is a ground of confidence to all those who are oppressed. "The
sea (ים construct state, as is frequently the case, with the retention
of the ) of the distant ones" is that of the regions lying afar off (cf.
[Psa 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001).md). Venema observes,
Significatur, Deum esse certissimum praesidium, sive agnoscatur ab
hominibus et ei fidatur, sive non (therefore similar to γνόντες, [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021); Psychol. S. 347; tr. p. 408.md).
But according tot he connection and the subjective colouring the idea
seems to have, מבטח וגו is to be understood of the believing
acknowledgment which the God of Israel attains among all mankind by
reason of His judicial and redemptive self-attestation (cf. [Isa
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013.md); [Ch2
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#022)..md). In the natural world and
among men He proves Himself to be the Being girded with power to whom
everything must yield. He it is who setteth fast the mountains (cf. [Jer
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012).md) and stilleth the raging of the
ocean. In connection with the giant mountains the poet may have had even
the worldly powers (vid., [Isa 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015).md)
in his mind; in connection with the seas he gives expression to this
allegorical conjunction of thoughts. The roaring of the billows and the
wild tumult of the nations as a mass in the empire of the world, both
are stilled by the threatening of the God of Israel ([Isa
17:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012).md). When He shall overthrow the
proud empire of the world, whose tyranny the earth has been made to feel
far and wide, then will reverential fear of Him and exultant joy at the
end of the thraldom (vid., [Isa
13:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004).md) become universal. אותת (from
the originally feminine אות = ăwăjat, from אוה, to mark, [Num
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#010).md), σημεῖα, is the name given here
to His marvellous interpositions in the history of our earth. קצוי, [Psa
65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006.md) (also in [Isa
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#015).md), out of construction is קצות.
"The exit places of the morning and of the evening" are the East and
West with reference to those who dwell there. Luther erroneously
understands מוצאי as directly referring to the creatures which at
morning and evening "sport about (webern), i.e., go safely and joyfully
out and in." The meaning is, the regions whence the morning breaks forth
and where the evening sets. The construction is zeugmatic so far as
בּוא, not יצא, is said of the evening sun, but only to a certain extent,
for neither does one say נבוא ערב (Ewald). Perret-Gentil renders it
correctly: les lieux d'o surgissent l'aube et le crepuscule. God makes
both these to shout for joy, inasmuch as He commands a calm to the din
of war.

[Psalms 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 65:9</span></span>

The praise of God on account of the present year's rich blessing, which
He has bestowed upon the land of His people. In [Psa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010.md), [Psa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011.md) God is thanked for having sent
down the rain required for the ploughing (vid., Commentary on Isaiah,
ii. 522) and for the increase of the seed sown, so that, as vv. 12-14
affirm, there is the prospect of a rich harvest. The harvest itself, as
follows from v. 14b, is not yet housed. The whole of [Psa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010.md), [Psa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011.md) is a retrospect; in vv. 12-14
the whole is a description of the blessing standing before their eyes,
which God has put upon the year now drawing to a close. Certainly, if
the forms רוּה and נחת were supplicatory imperatives, then the prayer
for the early or seed-time rain would attach itself to the retrospect in
[Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011.md), and the standpoint would
be not about the time of the Passover and Pentecost, both festivals
belonging to the beginning of the harvest, but about the time of the
feast of Tabernacles, the festival of thanksgiving for the harvest, and
vv. 12-14 would be a glance into the future (Hitzig). But there is
nothing to indicate that in [Psa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011.md)
the retrospect changes into a looking forward. The poet goes on with the
same theme, and also arranges the words accordingly, for which reason
רוּה and נחת are not to be understood in any other way. שׁקק beside
העשׁיר (to enrich) signifies to cause to run over, overflow, i.e., to
put anything in a state of plenty or abundance, from שׁוּק (Hiph. [Joe
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#024), to yield in abundance.md), Arab,
sâq, to push, impel, to cause to go on in succession and to follow in
succession. רבּת (for which we find רבּה in [Psa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003).md) is an adverb, copiously, richly
([Psa 120:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#006.md); [Psa
123:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#004.md); [Psa
129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001).md), like מאת, a hundred times
([Ecc 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012).md). תּעשׁרנּה is Hiph. with
the middle syllable shortened, Ges. 53, 3, rem. 4. The fountain (פּלג)
of God is the name given here to His inexhaustible stores of blessing,
and more particularly the fulness of the waters of the heavens from
which He showers down fertilizing rain. כּן, "thus thoroughly," forms an
alliteration with הכין, to prepare, and thereby receives a peculiar
twofold colouring. The meaning is: God, by raising and tending, prepared
the produce of the field which the inhabitants of the land needed; for
He thus thoroughly prepared the land in conformity with the fulness of
His fountain, viz., by copiously watering (רוּה infin. absol. instead of
רוּה, as in [Sa1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#012.md); [Ch2
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#010.md); [Exo
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#022.md); [Jer
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019.md); [Hos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009).md) the furrows of the land and
pressing down, i.e., softening by means of rain, its ridges (גּדוּדה,
defective plural, as e.g., in [Rut
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#013).md), which the ploughshare has made.
תּלם (related by root with Arab. tll, tell, a hill, prop. that which is
thrown out to a place, that which is thrown up, a mound) signifies a
furrow as being formed by casting up or (if from Arab. ṯlm, ébrécher, to
make a fracture, rent, or notch in anything) by tearing into, breaking
up the ground; גּדוּד (related by root with uchdûd and chaṭṭ, the usual
Arabic words for a furrow

(Note: Frst erroneously explains תּלם as a bed or strip of ground
between two deep furrows, in distinction from מענה or מענית (vid., on
[Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003).md), a furrow. Beds such as we
have in our potato fields are unknown to Syrian agriculture. There is a
mode which may be approximately compared with it called ketif (כּתף),
another far wider called meskeba (משׂכּבה). The Arabic tilm (תּלם,
Hebrew תּלם = talm), according to the Kams (as actually in Magrebinish
Arabic) talam (תּלם), corresponds exact to our furrow, i.e., (as the
Turkish Kams explains) a ditch-like fissure which the iron of the plough
cuts into the field. Neshwn (i. 491) says: "The verb talam, fut. jatlum
and jatlim, signifies in Jemen and in the Ghr (the land on the shore of
the Red Sea) the crevices (Arab. 'l-šuqûq) which the ploughman forms,
and tilm, collective plural tilâm, is, in the countries mentioned, a
furrow of the corn-field. Some persons pronounce the word even thilm,
collective plural thilâm." Thus it is at the present day universally in
Ḥaurân; in Edre‛ât I heard the water-furrow of a corn-field called thilm
el-kanâh (Arab. ṯlm 'l-qnât). But this pronunciation with Arab. ṯ is
certainly not the original one, but has arisen through a substitution of
the cognate and more familiar verbal stem Arab. ṯlm, cf. šrm, to slit
(shurêm, a harelip). In other parts of Syria and Palestine, also where
the distinction between the sounds Arab. t and ṯ is carefully observed,
I have only heard the pronunciation tilm. - Wetzstein.))

as being formed by cutting into the ground.

In [Psa 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012.md) the year in itself
appears as a year of divine goodness (טובה, bonitas), and the
prospective blessing of harvest as the crown which is set upon it. For
Thou hast crowned "the year of Thy goodness" and "with Thy goodness" are
different assertions, with which also different (although kindred as to
substance) ideas are associated. The futures after עטרתּ depict its
results as they now lie out to view. The chariot-tracks (vid., [Deu
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026).md) drop with exuberant
fruitfulness, even the meadows of the uncultivated and, without rain,
unproductive pasture land ([Job
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#026)..md). The hills are personified in
[Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013.md) in the manner of which
Isaiah in particular is so fond (e.g., [Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md); [Psa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013).md), and which we find in the
Psalms of his type ([Psa 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md)., [Psa
98:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#007.md)., cf. [Psa
89:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#013).md). Their fresh, verdant
appearance is compared to a festive garment, with which those which
previously looked bare and dreary gird themselves; and the corn to a
mantle in which the valleys completely envelope themselves (עטף with the
accusative, like Arab. t‛ṭṭf with b of the garment: to throw it around
one, to put it on one's self). The closing words, locking themselves as
it were with the beginning of the Psalm together, speak of joyous
shouting and singing that continues into the present time. The meadows
and valleys (Bttcher) are not the subject, of which it cannot be said
that they sing; nor can the same be said of the rustling of the waving
corn-fields (Kimchi). The expression requires men to be the subject, and
refers to men in the widest and most general sense. Everywhere there is
shouting coming up from the very depths of the breast (Hithpal.),
everywhere songs of joy; for this is denoted by שׁיר in distinction from
קנן.
