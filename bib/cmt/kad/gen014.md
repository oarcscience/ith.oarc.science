### [Genesis Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 14:1</span></span>

The war, which furnished Abram with an opportunity, while in the
promised land of which as yet he could not really call a single rood his
own, to prove himself a valiant warrior, and not only to smite the
existing chiefs of the imperial power of Asia, but to bring back to the
kings of Canaan the booty that had been carried off, is circumstantially
described, not so much in the interests of secular history as on account
of its significance in relation to the kingdom of God. It is of
importance, however, as a simple historical fact, to see that in the
statement in [Gen 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md), the king of
Shinar occupies the first place, although the king of Edom,
Chedorlaomer, not only took the lead in the expedition, and had allied
himself for that purpose with the other kings, but had previously
subjugated the cities of the valley of Siddim, and therefore had
extended his dominion very widely over hither Asia. If, notwithstanding
this, the time of the war related here is connected with "the days of
Amraphel, king of Shinar," this is done, no doubt, with reference to the
fact that the first worldly kingdom was founded in Shinar by Nimrod
([Gen 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010).md), a kingdom which still
existed under Amraphel, though it was now confined to Shinar itself,
whilst Elam possessed the supremacy in inner Asia. There is no ground
whatever for regarding the four kings mentioned in [Gen
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md) as four Assyrian generally or
viceroys, as Josephus has done in direct contradiction to the biblical
text; for, according to the more careful historical researches, the
commencement of the Assyrian kingdom belongs to a later period; and
Berosus speaks of an earlier Median rule in Babylon, which reaches as
far back as the age of the patriarchs (cf. M. v. Niebuhr, Gesch. Assurs,
p. 271). It appears significant also, that the imperial power of Asia
had already extended as far as Canaan, and had subdued the valley of the
Jordan, no doubt with the intention of holding the Jordan valley as the
high-road to Egypt. We have here a prelude of the future assault of the
worldly power upon the kingdom of God established in Canaan; and the
importance of this event to sacred history consists in the fact, that
the kings of the valley of the Jordan and the surrounding country
submitted to the worldly power, whilst Abram, on the contrary, with his
home-born servants, smote the conquerors and rescued their booty, - a
prophetic sign that in the conflict with the power of the world the seed
of Abram would not only not be subdued, but would be able to rescue from
destruction those who appealed to it for aid.

[Gen 14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md)

In [Gen 14:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md) the account is
introduced by a list of the parties engaged in war. The kings named here
are not mentioned again. On Shinar, see [Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010.md); and on Elam, [Gen
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#022.md). It cannot be determined with
certainty where Ellasar was. Knobel supposes it to be Artemita, which
was also called Χαλάσαρ, in southern Assyria, to the north of Babylon.
Goyim is not used here for nations generally, but is the name of one
particular nation or country. In Delitzsch's opinion it is an older name
for Galilee, though probably with different boundaries (cf. [Jos
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#023.md); [Jdg
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002.md); and [Isa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001)). - The verb עשׂוּ (made.md), in [Gen
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#002.md), is governed by the kings
mentioned in [Gen 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md). To Bela, whose
king is not mentioned by name, the later name Zoar (vid., [Gen
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#022).md) is added as being better known.

[Gen 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#003.md)

"All these (five kings) allied themselves together, (and came with their
forces) into the vale of Siddim (השׂדּים, prob. fields of plains), which
is the Salt Sea;" that is to say, which was changed into the Salt Sea on
the destruction of its cities ([Gen
19:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024).md). That there should be five
kings in the five cities (πεντάπολις, Wis. 10:6) of this valley, was
quite in harmony with the condition of Canaan, where even at a later
period every city had its king.

[Gen 14:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#004.md)

The occasion of the war was the revolt of the kings of the vale of
Siddim from Chedorlaomer. They had been subject to him for twelve years,
"and the thirteenth year they rebelled." In the fourteenth year
Chedorlaomer came with his allies to punish them for their rebellion,
and attacked on his way several other cities to the east of the Arabah,
as far as the Elanitic Gulf, no doubt because they also had withdrawn
from his dominion. The army moved along the great military road from
inner Asia, past Damascus, through Peraea, where they smote the
Rephaims, Zuzims, Emims, and Horites. "The Rephaim in Ashteroth
Karnaim:" all that is known with certainty of the Rephaim is, that they
were a tribe of gigantic stature, and in the time of Abram had spread
over the whole of Peraea, and held not only Bashan, but the country
afterwards possessed by the Moabites; from which possessions they were
subsequently expelled by the descendants of Lot and the Amorites, and so
nearly exterminated, that Og, king of Bashan, is described as the
remnant of the Rephaim ([Deu 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020.md);
[Deu 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md), [Deu
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013.md); [Jos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004.md); [Jos
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#012).md). Beside this, there were
Rephaim on this side of the Jordan among the Canaanitish tribes ([Gen
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#020).md), some to the west of Jerusalem,
in the valley which was called after them the valley of the Rephaim
([Jos 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008.md); [Jos
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#016.md); [Sa2
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#018), etc..md), others on the mountains
of Ephraim ([Jos 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015).md); while the
last remains of them were also to be found among the Philistines ([Sa2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#016.md).; [Ch1
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#004)..md). The current explanation of the
name, viz., "the long-stretched," or giants (Ewald), does not prevent
our regarding רפא as the personal name of their forefather, though no
intimation is given of their origin. That they were not Canaanites may
be inferred from the fact, that on the eastern side of the Jordan they
were subjugated and exterminated by the Canaanitish branch of the
Amorites. Notwithstanding this, they may have been descendants of Ham,
though the fact that the Canaanites spoke a Semitic tongue rather
favours the conclusion that the oldest population of Canaan, and
therefore the Rephaim, were of Semitic descent. At any rate, the opinion
of J. G. Mller, that they belonged to the aborigines, who were not
related to Shem, Ham, and Japhet, is perfectly arbitrary. - Ashteroth
Karnaim, or briefly Ashtaroth, the capital afterwards of Og of Bashan,
was situated in Hauran; and ruins of it are said to be still seen in
Tell Ashtereh, two hours and a half from Nowah, and one and
three-quarters from the ancient Edrei, somewhere between Nowah and
Mezareib (see Ritter, Erdkunde).

(Note: J. G. Wetztein, however, has lately denied the identity of
Ashteroth Karnaim, which he interprets as meaning Ashtaroth near
Karnaim, with Ashtaroth the capital of Og (see Reiseber. b. Hauran, etc.
1860, p. 107). But he does so without sufficient reason. He disputes
most strongly the fact that Ashtaroth was situated on the hill Ashtere,
because the Arabs now in Hauran assured him, that the ruins of this Tell
(or hill) suggested rather a monastery or watch-tower than a large city,
and associates it with the Bostra of the Greeks and Romans, the modern
Bozra, partly on account of the central situation of this town, and its
consequent importance to Hauran and Peraea generally, and partly also on
account of the similarity in the name, as Bostra is the latinized form
of Beeshterah, which we find in [Jos
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#027.md) in the place of the Ashtaroth of
[Ch1 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#056.md); and that form is composed
of Beth Ashtaroth, to which there are as many analogies as there are
instances of the omission of Beth before the names of towns, which is a
sufficient explanation of Ashtaroth (cf. Ges. thes., p. 175 and 193).)

"The Zuzims in Ham" were probably the people whom the Ammonites called
Zam zummim, and who were also reckoned among the Rephaim ([Deu
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020).md). Ham was possibly the ancient
name of Rabba of the Ammonites ([Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011).md), the remains being still
preserved in the ruins of Ammn. - "The Emim in the plain of Kiryathaim:"
the אימים or אמים (i.e., fearful, terrible), were the earlier
inhabitants of the country of the Moabites, who gave them the name; and,
like the Anakim, they were also reckoned among the Rephaim ([Deu
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011).md). Kiryathaim is certainly not to
be found where Eusebius and Jerome supposed, viz., in Καριάδα,
Coraiatha, the modern Koerriath or Kereyat, ten miles to the west of
Medabah; for this is not situated in the plain, and corresponds to
Kerioth ([Jer 48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024).md), with which
Eusebius and Jerome have confounded Kiryathaim. It is probably still to
be seen in the ruins of el Teym or et Tueme, about a mile to the west of
Medabah. "The Horites (from חרי, dwellers in caves), in the mountains of
Seir," were the earlier inhabitants of the land between the Dead Sea and
the Elanitic Gulf, who were conquered and exterminated by the Edomites
([Gen 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020)..md). - "To El-paran, which
is by the wilderness:" i.e., on the eastern side of the desert of Paran
(see [Gen 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#021).md), probably the same as
Elath ([Deu 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#008).md) or Eloth ([Kg1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026).md), the important harbour of Aila
on the northern extremity of the so-called Elanitic Gulf, near the
modern fortress of Akaba, where extensive heaps of rubbish show the site
of the former town, which received its name El or Elath (terebinth, or
rather wood) probably from the palm-groves in the vicinity.

[Gen 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007.md)

From Aila the conquerors turned round, and marched (not through the
Arabah, but on the desert plateau which they ascended from Aila) to
En-mishpat (well of judgment), the older name of Kadesh, the situation
of which, indeed, cannot be proved with certainty, but which is most
probably to be sought for in the neighbourhood of the spring Ain Kades,
discovered by Rowland, to the south of Bir Seba and Khalasa (Elusa),
twelve miles E.S.E. of Moyle, the halting-place for caravans, near
Hagar's well ([Gen 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#014).md), on the
heights of Jebel Halal (see Ritter, Erdkunde, and Num 13). "And they
smote all the country of the Amalekites," i.e., the country afterwards
possessed by the Amalekites (vid., [Gen
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012).md),

(Note: The circumstance that in the midst of a list of tribes who were
defeated, we find not the tribe but only the fields (שׂדה) of the
Amalekites mentioned, can only be explained on the supposition that the
nation of the Amalekites was not then in existence, and the country was
designated proleptically by the name of its future and well-known
inhabitants (Hengstenberg, Diss. ii. p. 249, translation).)

to the west of Edomitis on the southern border of the mountains of Judah
([Num 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029).md), "and also the Amorites,
who dwelt in Hazazon-Thamar," i.e., Engedi, on the western side of the
Dead Sea ([Ch2 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002).md).

[Gen 14:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#008.md)

After conquering all these tribes to the east and west of the Arabah,
they gave battle to the kings of the Pentapolis in the vale of Siddim,
and put them to flight. The kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fell there, the
valley being full of asphalt-pits, and the ground therefore unfavourable
for flight; but the others escaped to the mountains (הרה for ההרה), that
is, to the Moabitish highlands with their numerous defiles. The
conquerors thereupon plundered the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and
carried off Lot, who dwelt in Sodom, and all his possessions, along with
the rest of the captives, probably taking the route through the valley
of the Jordan up to Damascus.

[Genesis 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 14:13</span></span>

A fugitive (lit., the fugitive; the article denotes the genus, Ewald,
277) brought intelligence of this to Abram the Hebrew (העברי, an
immigrant from beyond the Euphrates). Abram is so called in distinction
from Mamre and his two brothers, who were Amorites, and had made a
defensive treaty with him. To rescue Lot, Abram ordered his trained
slaves (חניכיו, i.e., practised in arms) born in the house (cf. [Gen
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012).md), 318 men, to turn out (lit., to
pour themselves out); and with these, and (as the supplementary remark
in [Gen 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#024) shows.md) with his allies,
he pursued the enemy as far as Dan, where "he divided himself against
them, he and his servants, by night," - i.e., he divided his men into
companies, who fell upon the enemy by night from different sides -
"smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, to the left (or north) of
Damascus." Hobah has probably been preserved in the village of Noba,
mentioned by Troilo, a quarter of a mile to the north of Damascus. So
far as the situation of Dan is concerned, this passage proves that it
cannot have been identical with Leshem or Laish in the valley of Beth
Rehob, which the Danites conquered and named Dan ([Jdg
18:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#028.md); [Jos
19:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047).md); for this Laish-Dan was on the
central source of the Jordan, el Leddan in Tell el Kady, which does not
lie in either of the two roads, leading from the vale of Siddim or of
the Jordan to Damascus.

(Note: One runs below the Sea of Galilee past Fik and Nowa, almost in a
straight line to Damascus; the other from Jacob's Bridge, below Lake
Merom. But if the enemy, instead of returning with their booty to
Thapsacus, on the Euphrates, by one of the direct roads leading from the
Jordan past Damascus and Palmyra, had gone through the land of Canaan to
the sources of the Jordan, they would undoubtedly, when defeated at
Laish-Dan, have fled through the Wady et Teim and the Bekaa to Hamath,
and not by Damascus at all (vid., Robinson, Bibl. Researches).)

This Dan belonged to Gilead ([Deu
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001).md), and is no doubt the same as the
Dan-Jaan mentioned in [Sa2 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#006.md) in
connection with Gilead, and to be sought for in northern Peraea to the
south-west of Damascus.

[Genesis 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 14:17</span></span>

As Abram returned with the booty which he had taken from the enemy, the
king of Sodom (of course, the successor to the one who fell in the
battle) and Melchizedek, king of Salem, came to meet him to congratulate
him on his victory; the former probably also with the intention of
asking for the prisoners who had been rescued. They met him in "the
valley of Shaveh, which is (what was afterwards called) the King's
dale." This valley, in which Absalom erected a monument for himself
([Sa2 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018).md), was, according to
Josephus, two stadia from Jerusalem, probably by the brook Kidron
therefore, although Absalom's pillar, which tradition places there, was
of the Grecian style rather than the early Hebrew. The name King's dale
was given to it undoubtedly with reference to the event referred to
here, which points to the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. For the Salem of
Melchizedek cannot have been the Salem near to which John baptized ([Joh
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#023).md), or Aenon, which was eight Roman
miles south of Scythopolis, as a march of about forty hours for the
purpose of meeting Abraham, if not romantic, would, at least be at
variance with the text of Scripture, where the kings are said to have
gone out to Abram after his return. It must be Jerusalem, therefore,
which is called by the old name Salem in [Psa
76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002.md), out of which the name Jerusalem
(founding of peace, or possession of peace) was formed by the addition
of the prefix ירוּ = ירוּי "founding," or ירוּשׁ "possession."
Melchizedek brings bread and wine from Salem "to supply the exhausted
warriors with food and drink, but more especially as a mark of gratitude
to Abram, who had conquered for them peace, freedom, and prosperity"
(Delitzsch). This gratitude he expresses, as a priest of the supreme
God, in the words, "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, the founder
of heaven and earth; and blessed be God, the Most High, who hath
delivered thine enemies into thy hand." The form of the blessing is
poetical, two parallel members with words peculiar to poetry, צריך for
איביך, and מגּן. - עליון אל without the article is a proper name for the
supreme God, the God over all (cf. [Exo
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#011).md), who is pointed out as the only
true God by the additional clause, "founder of the heaven and the
earth." On the construction of בּרוּך with ל, vid., [Gen
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#015.md); [Exo
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016.md), and Ges. 143, 2. קנה, founder
and possessor: קנה combines the meanings of κτίζειν and κτᾶσθαι. This
priestly reception Abram reciprocated by giving him the tenth of all,
i.e., of the whole of the booty taken from the enemy. Giving the tenth
was a practical acknowledgment of the divine priesthood of Melchizedek;
for the tenth was, according to the general custom, the offering
presented to the Deity. Abram also acknowledged the God of Melchizedek
as the true God; for when the king of Sodom asked for his people only,
and would have left the rest of the booty to Abram, he lifted up his
hand as a solemn oath "to Jehovah, the Most High God, the founder of
heaven and earth," - acknowledging himself as the servant of this God by
calling Him by the name Jehovah, - and swore that he would not take
"from a thread to a shoe-string," i.e., the smallest or most worthless
thing belonging to the king of Sodom, that he might not be able to say,
he had made Abram rich. אם, as the sign of an oath, is negative, and in
an earnest address is repeated before the verb. "Except (בּלעדי, lit.,
not to me, nothing for me) only what the young men (Abram's men) have
eaten, and the portion of my allies...let them take their portion:"
i.e., his followers should receive what had been consumed as their
share, and the allies should have the remainder of the booty.

Of the property belonging to the king of Sodom, which he had taken from
the enemy, Abram would not keep the smallest part, because he would not
have anything in common with Sodom. On the other hand, he accepted from
Salem's priest and king, Melchizedek, not only bread and wine for the
invigoration of the exhausted warriors, but a priestly blessing also,
and gave him in return the tenth of all his booty, as a sign that he
acknowledged this king as a priest of the living God, and submitted to
his royal priesthood. In this self-subordination of Abram to Melchizedek
there was the practical prediction of a royal priesthood which is higher
than the priesthood entrusted to Abram's descendants, the sons of Levi,
and foreshadowed in the noble form of Melchizedek, who blessed as king
and priest the patriarch whom God had called to be a blessing to all the
families of the earth. The name of this royal priest is full of meaning:
Melchizedek, i.e., King of Righteousness. Even though, judging from [Jos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md), [Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md), where a much later king is
called Adonizedek, i.e., Lord of Righteousness, this name may have been
a standing title of the ancient kings of Salem, it no doubt originated
with a king who ruled his people in righteousness, and was perfectly
appropriate in the case of the Melchizedek mentioned here. There is no
less significance in the name of the seat of his government, Salem, the
peaceful or peace, since it shows that the capital of its kings was a
citadel of peace, not only as a natural stronghold, but through the
righteousness of its sovereign; for which reason David chose it as the
seat of royalty in Israel; and Moriah, which formed part of it, was
pointed out to Abraham by Jehovah as the place of sacrifice for the
kingdom of God which was afterwards to be established. And, lastly,
there was something very significant in the appearance in the midst of
the degenerate tribes of Canaan of this king of righteousness, and
priest of the true God of heaven and earth, without any account of his
descent, or of the beginning and end of his life; so that he stands
forth in the Scriptures, "without father, without mother, without
descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life." Although it
by no means follows from this, however, that Melchizedek was a celestial
being (the Logos, or an angel), or one of the primeval patriarchs (Enoch
or Shem), as Church fathers, Rabbins, and others have conjectured, and
we can see in him nothing more than one, perhaps the last, of the
witnesses and confessors of the early revelation of God, coming out into
the light of history from the dark night of heathenism; yet this
appearance does point to a priesthood of universal significance, and to
a higher order of things, which existed at the commencement of the
world, and is one day to be restored again. In all these respects, the
noble form of this king of Salem and priest of the Most High God was a
type of the God-King and eternal High Priest Jesus Christ; a thought
which is expanded in Heb 7 on the basis of this account, and of the
divine utterance revealed to David in the Spirit, that the King of Zion
sitting at the right hand of Jehovah should be a priest for ever after
the order of Melchizedek ([Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004).md).
