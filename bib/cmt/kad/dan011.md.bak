The Revelation of the Future - Daniel 11:2-12:3

Proceeding from the present, the angel reveals in great general outlines
the career of the Persian world-kingdom, and the establishment and
destruction, which immediately followed, of the kingdom which was
founded by the valiant king of Javan, which would not descend to his
posterity, but would fall to others ([Dan
11:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002).md). Then there follows a detailed
description of the wars of the kings of the south and the north for the
supremacy, wherein first the king of the south prevails ([Dan
11:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005).md); the decisive conflicts
between the two ([Dan 11:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010).md),
wherein the south is subjugated; and the attempts of the kings of the
north to extend their power more widely, wherein they perish ([Dan
11:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013).md); finally, the coming of a
"vile person," who rises suddenly to power by cunning and intrigue,
humbles the king of the south, has "indignation against the holy
covenant," desolates the sanctuary of God, and brings severe affliction
upon the people of God, "to purge and to make them white to the time of
the end" ([Dan 11:21-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021).md). At the time
of the end this hostile king shall raise himself above all gods, and
above every human ordinance, and make the "god of fortresses" his god,
"whom he will acknowledge and increase with glory" ([Dan
11:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036).md). But in the time of the end
he shall pass through the countries with his army as a flood, enter into
the glorious land, and take possession of Egypt with its treasures; but,
troubled by tidings out of the east and the north, shall go forth in
great fury utterly to destroy many, and shall come to his end on the
holy mountain ([Dan 11:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md). At this
time of greatest tribulation shall the angel-prince Michael contend for
the people of Daniel. Every one that shall be found written in the book
shall be saved, and the dead shall rise again, some to everlasting life,
some to everlasting shame ([Dan
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md).

This prophecy is so rich in special features which in part have been
literally fulfilled, that believing interpreters from Jerome to Kliefoth
have found in it predictions which extend far beyond the measure of
prophetic revelation, while rationalistic and naturalistic interpreters,
following the example of Porphyry, from the speciality of the
predictions, conclude that the chapter does not contain a prophetic
revelation of the future, but only an apocalyptic description of the
past and of the present of the Maccabean pseudo-Daniel. Against both
views Kranichfeld has decidedly declared himself, and sought to show
that in these prophetic representations "the prediction does not press
itself into the place of historical development, i.e., that it does not
concern itself with such future dates as do not connect themselves with
the historical present of the prophetic author (Daniel), as the
unfolding of religious moral thought animated by divine influence." This
is on the whole correct. Here also the prophecy does not become the
prediction of historical dates which do not stand in inner connection
with the fundamental idea of the book, which is to announce the
unfolding of the heathen world-power over against the kingdom of God.
This vision, also, as to its contents and form, is accounted for from
the circumstances of time stated in [Dan
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md), and contains much which a
supposed Maccabean origin makes in the highest degree improbable, and
directly contradicts. First, it is "against the nature of a fictitious
production which should be written in the time of the greatest national
commotion, that the great repeated victories of the people over the
Syrian power should have been so slightingly spoken of as is the case
here ([Dan 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#034).md)," i.e., should be
designated only as "a little help." Then the prophetic representation
over against the historical facts of the case is full of inaccuracies;
and these historical inconveniences are found not only in the
description which had reference to the history of the times preceding
the author, but also, above all, in the history of the times of the
Maccabees themselves. Thus, e.g., in [Dan
11:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md) an Egyptian expedition of
Antiochus Epiphanes shortly before his death is prophesied, for which,
besides Porphyry, no voucher and, in general, no historical probability
exists (Kran.).

Kranichfeld, however, goes too far when he holds all the special
features of the prophetic revelation to be only individualizing
paintings for the purpose of the contemplation, and therein seeks to
find further developed only the fundamental thoughts of the great inner
incurable enmity of the heathen ungodly kingdom already stated in [Dan
2:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#041.md); [Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md), [Dan
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#020.md),[Dan
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024.md); [Dan
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008.md), [Dan
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022.md), [Dan
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024.md). The truth lies in the middle
between these two extremes.

This chapter contains neither mere individualizing paintings of general
prophetic thoughts, nor predictions of historical dates inconsistent
with the nature of prophecy, but prophetic descriptions of the
development of the heathen world-power from the days of Cyrus to the
fall of the Javanic world-kingdom, as well as of the position which the
two kingdoms (arising out of this kingdom) of the north and south,
between which the holy land lay, assumed toward each other and toward
the theocracy; for by the war of these two kingdoms for the sovereignty,
not merely were the covenant land and the covenant people brought in
general into a sorrowful condition, but they also were the special
object of a war which typically characterizes and portrays the relation
of the world-kingdom to the kingdom of God. This war arose under the
Seleucidan Antiochus Epiphanes to such a height, that it formed a
prelude of the war of the time of the end. The undertaking of this king
to root out the worship of the living God and destroy the Jewish
religion, shows in type the great war which the world-power in the last
phases of its development shall undertake against the kingdom of God, by
exalting itself above every god, to hasten on its own destruction and
the consummation of the kingdom of God.

The description of this war as to its origin, character, and issue forms
the principal subject of this prophecy. It is set forth in the
revelation of the angel from [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md) to the end ([Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003).md), while the preceding
description, as well of the course of the Persian and Javanic
world-kingdoms as of the wars of the kings of the north and the south
(Daniel 11:2-20), prepares for it. But this preparatory description is
not merely individualizing pictures of the idea of the incurable
hostility of the heathen ungodly kingdom, but a prophetic delineation of
the chief lines of the process which the heathen world-power shall pass
through till it shall advance to the attempt to destroy the kingdom of
God. These chief lines are so distinctly laid down, that they contain
their concrete fulfilment in the historical development of the
world-power. In like manner are so described the appearance and the wars
of the enemy of God, who desolates the sanctuary of God and takes away
the daily sacrifice, that we can recognise in the assault of Antiochus
Epiphanes against the temple and the worship of the people of Israel a
fulfilling of this prophecy. Yet here the foretelling (Weissagung) does
not renounce the character of prophecy (Prophetie): it does not pass
over into prediction (Praediction) of historical facts and events, but
so places in the light of the divine foresight and predetermination the
image of this enemy of God, and his wickedness against the sanctuary and
the people of God, that it brings under contemplation, and places under
the point of view of the purification of the covenant people for the
time of the end ([Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035).md), the
gradual progress of his enmity against God till he exalts himself above
all divine and human relations.

From the typical relation in which Antiochus, the O.T. enemy of God,
stands to Antichrist, the N.T. enemy, is explained the connection of the
end, the final salvation of the people of God, and the resurrection from
the dead, with the destruction of this enemy, without any express
mention being made of the fourth world-kingdom and of the last enemy
arising out of it; from which the modern critics have drawn the
erroneous conclusion, that the Maccabean pseudo-Daniel expected the
setting up of the Messianic kingdom in glory along with the overthrow of
Antiochus Epiphanes. At the foundation of this conclusion there lies an
entire misapprehension of the contents and object of this prophecy,
namely, the idea that the prophecy seeks to furnish a historical sketch,
clothed in an apocalyptic form, of the development of the world-kingdoms
from Cyrus to Antiochus Epiphanes. In support of this error, it is true
that the church interpretation given by Jerome is so far valid, in that
it interprets the prophecy partially considered under the point of view
of the very special predictions of historical persons and events, and
from this view concludes that [Dan
11:21-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md) treat of Antiochus Epiphanes,
and [Dan 11:36-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md) of Antichrist;
according to which there would be in [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md) an immediate passing from
Antiochus to the Antichrist, or in [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) a sudden transition from the
death of Antiochus to the time of the end and the resurrection from the
dead. But the prophecy does not at all correspond to this
representation. The Angel of the Lord will reveal to Daniel, not what
shall happen from the third year of Cyrus to the time of Antiochus, and
further to the resurrection of the dead, but, according to the express
declaration of [Dan 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#014.md), what shall
happen to his people בּאחרית היּמים, i.e., in the Messianic future,
because the prophecy relates to this time. In the אחרית takes place the
destruction of the world-power, and the setting up of the Messianic
kingdom at the end of the present world-aeon. All that the angel says
regarding the Persian and the Javanic world-kingdoms, and the wars of
the kings of the north and the south, has its aim to the end-time,
serves only briefly to indicate the chief elements of the development of
the world-kingdoms till the time when the war that brings in the end
shall burst forth, and to show how, after the overthrow of the Javanic
world-kingdom, neither the kings of the north nor those of the south
shall gain the possession of the dominion of the world. Neither by the
violence of war, nor by covenants which they will ratify by political
marriages, shall they succeed in establishing a lasting power. They
shall not prosper, because ([Dan
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#027).md) the end goes yet to the times
appointed (by God). A new attempt of the king of the north to subjugate
the kingdom of the south shall be defeated by the intervention of the
ships of Chittim; and the anger awakened in him by this frustration of
his plans shall break forth against the holy covenant, only for the
purifying of the people of God for the time of the end, because the end
goes yet to the appointed time ([Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035).md). At the time of the end his
power will greatly increase, because that which was determined by God
shall prosper till the end of the indignation ([Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036).md); but in the time of the end he
shall suddenly fall from the summit of his power and come to his end
([Dan 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045).md), but the people of God
shall be saved, and the wise shall shine in heavenly glory ([Dan
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md).

Accordingly the revelation has this as its object, to show how the
heathen world-kingdoms shall not attain to an enduring stability, and by
their persecution of the people of God shall only accomplish their
purification, and bring on the end, in which, through their destruction,
the people of God shall be delivered from all oppression and be
transfigured. In order to reveal this to him (that it must be carried
forward to completion by severe tribulation), it was not necessary that
he should receive a complete account of the different events which shall
take place in the heathen world-power in the course of time, nor have it
especially made prominent that their enmity shall first come to a
completed manifestation under the last king who should arise out of the
fourth world-kingdom. For that the Javanic world-kingdom shall not form
the last embodiment of the world-power, but that after it a fourth more
powerful kingdom shall arise - this was already revealed to Daniel in
Daniel 7. Moreover, in Daniel 8 the violent enemy of the people of
Israel who would arise from the Diadoch-kingdoms of the Javanic
world-monarchy, was already designated as the type of the last enemy who
would arise out of the ten kingdoms of the fourth world-kingdom. After
these preceding revelations, the announcement of the great tribulation
that would come upon the people of God from these two enemies could be
presented in one comprehensive painting, wherein the assault made by the
prefigurative enemy against the covenant people shall form the
foreground of the picture for a representation of the daring of the
antitypical enemy, proceeding even to the extent of abolishing all
divine and human ordinances, who shall bring the last and severest
tribulation on the church of God, at the end of the days, for its
purification and preparation for eternity.

[Daniel 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 11:1</span></span>

The first verse of the eleventh chapter belongs to [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021); the ואני (also I.md) is
emphatically placed over against the mention of Michael, whereby the
connection of this verse with [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md) is placed beyond a doubt, and at
the same time the reference of לו ([Dan
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001)) to מיכאל (Daniel 10:21b.md) is
decided. Hengstenberg indeed thinks (Christol. iii. 2, p. 53) that the
reference of the לו to Michael is "against all that is already spoken in
relation to Michael, and particularly against that which immediately
goes before," under a reference to Hitzig. But Hitzig only says that in
[Dan 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md) Michael is of one lineage
with the speaker; but, on the contrary, the expressions למחזיק (to
confirm) and למעוז (to strengthen) are so strong, that in לו we must
think on one inferior, a man. Moreover, Hitzig can think of nothing done
by Michael under Darius, since the transference of the kingdom to the
Medes changed nothing in the fortune of the Jews. This was first
effected by Cyrus. But Hengstenberg himself does not recognise this last
reason, but remarks that [Dan 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001.md)
relates to the transference of the sovereignty from the Chaldeans to the
Persians, whereby a way was opened for the return of Israel, and
rightly, with Hv., thus determines the meaning of the verse in general:
"As at that time the Lord made the change of the monarchy a cause of
blessing to the covenant people, so in all the troubles that may arise
to them in the heathen monarchies He will show Himself to be the same
true and gracious God." The other reason, namely, that the strong
expressions, "to confirm and strengthen," necessitate us to think of one
inferior as referred to in לו, affects only the view already refuted
above, that the speaker is either Gabriel or another inferior angel. If,
on the contrary, the speaker is one person with him who is clothed in
linen, i.e., with the Angel of the Lord, who is like unto God, then this
person can also say of himself that he was a help and protection to the
angel-prince Michael, because he stands higher than Michael; and the
reference of the לו to Michael, which the "also I" in contrast to
"Michael your prince" demands, corresponds wholly with that which is
said of Michael. Besides, the reference of לו to Darius (Hv., Hengstb.)
is excluded by this, that the name of Darius the Mede is not at all the
object of the statements of the verse to which לו could refer, but
occurs only in a subordinate or secondary determination of time. The
thought of the verse is accordingly the following: "In the first year of
Darius the Mede, Michael effected this, that Babylon, which was hostile
to the people of God, was overthrown by the power of Medo-Persia, in
doing which the Angel of the Lord rendered to him powerful help." To
this follows in order in [Dan 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002.md) the
announcement of the future, which is introduced by the formula 'וגו
ועתּה resumed from [Dan 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md).

[Daniel 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 11:2</span></span>

The events of the nearest future - Daniel 11:2-20

The revelation passes quickly from Persia ([Dan
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002).md) and the kingdom of Alexander
([Dan 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003.md), [Dan
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004).md), to the description of the wars
of the kingdoms of the south and the north, arising out of the latter,
in which wars the Holy Land, lying between the two, was implicated.
Regarding Persia it is only said that yet three kings shall arise, and
that the fourth, having reached to great power by his riches, shall stir
up all against the kingdom of Javan. Since this prophecy originates in
the third year of the Persian king Cyrus ([Dan
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001).md), then the three kings who shall
yet (עוד) arise are the three successors of Cyrus, viz., Cambyses, the
pseudo-Smerdis, and Darius Hystaspes; the fourth is then Xerxes, with
whom all that is said regarding the fourth perfectly agrees. Thus
Hvernick, Ebrard, Delitzsch, Auberlen, and Kliefoth interpret; on the
contrary, v. Lengerke, Maurer, Hitzig, and Kranichfeld will make the
fourth the third, so as thereby to justify the erroneous interpretation
of the four wings and the four heads of the leopard ([Dan
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006).md) of the first four kings of the
Persian monarchy, because, as they say, the article in הרביעי
necessarily requires that the fourth is already mentioned in the
immediately preceding statements. But the validity of this conclusion is
not to be conceived; and the assertion that the O.T. knows only of four
kings of Persia (Hitzig) cannot be established from [Ezr
4:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#005.md), nor from any other passage.
From the naming of only four kings of Persia in the book of Ezra, since
from the end of the Exile to Ezra and Nehemiah four kings had reigned,
it in no way follows that the book of Daniel and the O.T. generally know
of only four. Moreover, this assertion is not at all correct; for in
[Neh 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022.md), besides those four there
is mention made also of a Darius, and to the Jews in the age of the
Maccabees there was well known, according to 1 Macc. 1:1, also the name
of the last Persian king, Darius, who was put to death by Alexander. If
the last named, the king who by great riches ([Dan
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002).md) reached to a higher power, is
included among the three previously named, then he should have been here
designated "the third." The verb עמד, to place oneself, then to stand,
is used here and frequently in the following passages, as in [Dan
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023.md), in the sense of to stand up (=
קוּם), with reference to the coming of a new ruler. The gathering
together of greater riches than all (his predecessors), agrees specially
with Xerxes; cf. Herodot. iii. 96, vi. 27-29, and Justini Histor. ii. 2.
The latter says of him: "Divitias, non ducem laudes, quarum tanta copia
in regno ejus fuit, ut, cum flumina multitudine consumerentur, opes
tamen regiae superessent."

חזקתו is the infinit. or nomen actionis, the becoming strong; cf. [Ch2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001.md) with [Kg2
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#005.md) and [Isa
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md). בּעשׁרו is not in apposition to
it, "according to his riches" (Hv.); but it gives the means by which he
became strong. "Xerxes expended his treasures for the raising and arming
of an immense host, so as by such חזק (cf. [Amo
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013)) to conquer Greece" (Hitzig.md). יון
מלכוּת את is not in apposition to הכּל, all, namely, the kingdom of
Javan (Maurer, Kranichfeld). This does not furnish a suitable sense; for
the thought that הכּל, "they all," designates the divided states of
Greece, and the apposition, "the kingdom of Javan," denotes that they
were brought by the war with Xerxes to form themselves into the unity of
the Macedonian kingdom, could not possibly be so expressed. Moreover,
the reference to the circumstances of the Grecian states is quite
foreign to the context. מ יון את is much rather a second, more remote
object, and את is to be interpreted, with Hvernick, either as the
preposition with, so far as יעיר involves the idea of war, conflict, or
simply, with Hitzig, as the accusative of the object of the movement
(cf. [Exo 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#029.md), [Exo
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#033).md), to stir up, to rouse, after the
kingdom of Javan, properly to make, to cause, that all (הכּל = every
one, cf. [Psa 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003).md) set out towards.
Daniel calls Greece מלכוּת, after the analogy of the Oriental states, as
a united historical power, without respect to the political constitution
of the Grecian states, not suitable to prophecy (Kliefoth).

From the conflict of Persia with Greece, the angel ([Dan
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003).md) passes immediately over to the
founder of the Grecian (Macedonian) world-kingdom; for the prophecy
proceeds not to the prediction of historical details, but mentions only
the elements and factors which constitute the historical development.
The expedition of Xerxes against Greece brings to the foreground the
world-historical conflict between Persia and Greece, which led to the
destruction of the Persian kingdom by Alexander the Great. The reply of
Alexander to Darius Codomannus (Arrian, Exped Alex. ii. 14. 4) supplies
a historical document, in which Alexander justifies his expedition
against Persia by saying that Macedonia and the rest of Hellas were
assailed in war by the Persians without any cause (οὐδὲν προηδικημένοι),
and that therefore he had resolved to punish the Persians. A deeper
reason for this lies in this, that the prophecy closes the list of
Persian kings with Xerxes, but not in this, that under Xerxes the
Persian monarchy reached its climax, and partly already under him, and
yet more after his reign, the fall of the kingdom had begun (Hvernick,
Auberlen); still less in the opinion, proved to be erroneous, that the
Maccabean Jew knew no other Persian kings, and confounded Xerxes with
Darius Codomannus (v. Lengerke, Maurer, Hitzig).

[Daniel 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 11:3</span></span>

But only brief notices, characterizing its nature, were given regarding
the Macedonian kingdom, which agree with the prophecies [Dan
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006.md) and [Dan
8:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#005.md), [Dan
8:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021.md), without adding new elements.
The founder of the kingdom is called גּבּור מלך, "brave king,"
"hero-king," and his kingdom "a great dominion." Of his government it is
said כּרצונו עשׂה, he does, rules, according to his will (cf. [Dan
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#004).md), so that his power might be
characterized as irresistible and boundless self-will. Similarly Curtius
writes of him (x. 5. 35): Fatendum est, cum plurimum virtuti debuerit,
plus debuisse fortunae, quam solus omnium mortalium in potestate habuit.
Hujus siquidem beneficio agere videbatur gentibus quidquid placebat. By
the כ in כּעמדו the coming of the king and the destruction of his
kingdom are stated as synchronous, so as to express with great force the
shortness of its duration. עמדו is not to be otherwise interpreted than
עמד in [Dan 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003.md), and is thus not to
be translated: "when he thus stands up," sc. in the regal power
described in [Dan 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003) (Kran..md), or:
"on the pinnacle of his might" (Hv.), but: "when (or as) he has made his
appearance, his kingdom shall be broken." In the words, also, there does
not lie the idea "that he himself in his life-time is deprived of this
throne and his kingdom by a violent catastrophe" (Kran.); for the
destruction of the kingdom does not necessarily include in it the
putting to death of the ruler. The thought is only this: "when he has
appeared and founded a great dominion, his kingdom shall be immediately
broken." תּשּׁבר (shall be broken) is chosen with reference to [Dan
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008.md), "toward the four winds of
heaven." We may neither supply תחץ (shall be divided) to לאחריתו ולא
(and not to his posterity), nor is this latter expression "connected
with תחץ in pregnant construction;" for תחץ, from חצה, signifies to
divide, from which we are not to assume the idea of to allot, assign. We
have simply to supply היא in the sense of the verb. subst., shall be, as
well here as in the following clause, כמשׁלו ולא. The אחרית e signifies
here as little as in [Amo 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002.md); [Amo
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md), posterity = זרע, but remnant,
that which is left behind, the survivors of the king, by which we are to
understand not merely his sons, but all the members of his family.
כמשׁלו ולא, "and it shall not be according to the dominion which he
ruled." This thought, corresponding to בכחו ולא in [Dan
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022.md), is the natural conclusion from
the idea of division to all the four winds, which the falling asunder
into several or many small kingdoms involves. הנּתשׁ, "shall be plucked
up" (of plants from the earth), denotes the rooting up of that which is
table, the destroying and dissolving of the kingdom into portions. In
this division it shall pass to others מלּבד־אלּה, "with the exclusion of
those" (the אחרית), the surviving members of the family of Alexander. To
ולאחרים (and for others) supply תּהיה (shall be).

In [Dan 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004.md), accordingly, the
prophetic thought is expressed, that the Javanic kingdom, as soon as the
brave king has founded a great dominion, shall be broken to pieces and
divided toward the four winds of heaven, so that its separate parts,
without reaching to the might of the broken kingdom, shall be given not
to the survivors of the family of the founder, but to strangers. This
was historically fulfilled in the fact, that after the sudden death of
Alexander his son Hercules was not recognised by his generals as
successor on the throne, but was afterwards murdered by Polysperchon;
his son also born by Roxana, along with his guardian Philip Arideus, met
the same fate; but the generals, after they had at first divided the
kingdom into more than thirty parts, soon began to war with each other,
the result of which was, that at last four larger kingdoms were firmly
established. Cf. Diod. Sic. xx. 28, xix. 105; Pausan. ix. 7; Justini
hist. xv. 2, and Appiani Syr. c. 51.

[Daniel 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 11:5</span></span>

From the 5th verse the prophecy passes to the wars of the kings of the
south and the north for the supremacy and for the dominion over the Holy
Land, which lay between the two. [Dan
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005.md) describes the growing strength of
these two kings, and [Dan 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md) an
attempt made by them to join themselves together. חזק, to become strong.
The king of the south is the ruler of Egypt; this appears from the
context, and is confirmed by [Dan
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008.md). שׂריו וּמן is differently
interpreted; מן, however, is unanimously regarded as a partitive: "one
of his princes," as e.g., [Neh 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#028.md);
[Gen 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#011.md); [Exo
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#025.md). The suffix to שׂריו (his
princes) does not (with C. B. Michaelis, Bertholdt, Rosenmller, and
Kranichfeld) refer to גּבּור מלך, [Dan
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003.md), because this noun is too far
removed, and then also עליו must be referred to it; but thereby the
statement in [Dan 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005.md), that one of
the princes of the king of Javan would gain greater power and dominion
than the valiant king had, would contradict the statement in [Dan
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004.md), that no one of the Diadochs
would attain to the dominion of Alexander.

(Note: This contradiction is not set aside, but only strengthened, by
translating עליו יחזק "he overcame him" (Kran.), according to which the
king of Javan must be thought of as overcome by one of his princes, the
king of the south. For the thought that the king of Javan survived the
destruction of his kingdom, and that, after one of his princes had
become the king of the south and had founded a great dominion, he was
overcome by him, contradicts too strongly the statement of [Dan
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005.md), that the kingdom of the valiant
king of Javan would be destroyed, and that it would not fall to his
survivors, but to others with the exception of those, for one to be able
to interpret the words in this sense.)

The suffix to שׂריו can only be referred to the immediately preceding
הנגב מלך: "one of the princes of the king of the south." But then וin
וּמן cannot be explicative, but is only the simple copula. This
interpretation also is not opposed by the Atnach under שׂריו, for this
accent is added to the subject because it stands before separately, and
is again resumed in ויחזק by the copula ,ו as e.g., [Eze
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#019.md). The thought is this: one of the
princes of the king of the south shall attain to greater power than this
king, and shall found a great dominion. That this prince is the king of
the north, or founds a dominion in the north, is not expressly said, but
is gathered from [Dan 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md), where the
king of the south enters into a league with the king of the north.

[Daniel 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 11:6</span></span>

שׁנים לקץ, "in the end of years," i.e., after the expiry of a course of
years; cf. [Ch2 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#002.md). The subject to
יתחבּרוּ (join themselves, [Ch2 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#035).md)
cannot, it is evident, be אהרים, [Dan
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004) (Kran..md), but only the king of the
south and his prince who founded a great dominion, since the covenant,
according to the following clause, is brought about by the daughter of
the king of the south being given in marriage (אל בּוא, to come to, as
[Jos 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#018.md); [Jdg
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#014).md) to the king of the north, to
make מישׁרים, to effect an agreement. מישׁרים, rectitudes, synonymous
with righteousness and right, [Pro
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003.md), here designates the rectitude of
the relation of the two rulers to each other in regard to the intrigues
and deceits they had previously practised toward each other; thus not
union, but sincerity in keeping the covenant that had been concluded.
"But she shall not retain the power of the arm." כּוח עשׂר as [Dan
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#008.md), [Dan
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016.md), and הזּרוע, the arm as a figure
of help, assistance. The meaning is: she will not retain the power to
render the help which her marriage should secure; she shall not be able
to bring about and to preserve the sincerity of the covenant; and thus
the king of the south shall not be preserved with this his help, but
shall become subject to the more powerful king of the north. The
following passages state this. The subject to יעמד לא is the נגב מלך;
and his, i.e., this king's, help is his own daughter, who should
establish מישׁרים by her marriage with the king of the north. וּזרעו is
a second subject subordinated or co-ordinated to the subject lying in
the verb: he together with his help. We may not explain the passage:
neither he nor his help, because in this case הוּא could not be wanting,
particularly in comparison with the following היא. The "not standing" is
further positively defined by ותּנּתן, to be delivered up, to perish.
The plur. מביאיה is the plur. of the category: who brought her, i.e.,
who brought her into the marriage (מביא to be explained after בּוא),
without reference to the number of those who were engaged in doing so;
cf. The similar plur. in particip. [Lev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#008.md); [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009.md), and in the noun, [Gen
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007.md). היּלדהּ, particip. with the
suffix, wherein the article represents the relative אשׁר. מחזיק, in the
same meaning as [Dan 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001.md), the
support, the helper. The sense is: not only she, but all who brought
about the establishment of this marriage, and the object aimed at by it.
בּעתּים has the article: in the times determined for each of these
persons.

[Daniel 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 11:7</span></span>

A violent war shall then break out, in which the king of the north shall
be overcome. One of the offspring of her roots shall appear. מן in מנּצר
is partitive, as [Dan 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005.md), and נצר is
used collectively. The figure reminds us of [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md). The suffix to שׁרשׁיה refers to
the king's daughter, [Dan 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md). Her
roots are her parents, and the offspring of her roots a brother of the
king's daughter, but not a descendant of his daughter, as Kranichfeld by
losing sight of נצר supposes. כּנּו is the accusative of direction, for
which, in [Dan 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#020.md), [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md), [Dan
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#038.md), כּנּו על stands more
distinctly; the suffix refers to the king of the south, who was also the
subject in יעמד, [Dan 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md). אל־החיל
יבא does not mean: he will go to the (to his) army (Michaelis, Berth.,
v. Leng., Hitz., Klief.); this would be a very heavy remark within the
very characteristic, significant description here given (Kran., Hv.);
nor does it mean: he attained to might (Hv.); but: he shall come to the
army, i.e., against the host of the enemy, i.e., the king of the north
(Kran.). אל בּוא, as [Gen 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md); [Isa
37:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#033.md), is used of a hostile approach
against a camp, a city, so as to take it, in contradistinction to the
following בּמעוז יבא: to penetrate into the fortress. מעוז has a
collective signification, as בּהם referring to it shows. ב עשׂה, to act
against or with any one, cf. [Jer
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#023) ("deal with them".md), ad libidinem
agere (Maurer), essentially corresponding to כּרצונו in [Dan
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md), [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md). החזיק, to show power, i.e., to
demonstrate his superior power.

[Daniel 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 11:8</span></span>

To bring the subjugated kingdom wholly under his power, he shall carry
away its gods along with all the precious treasures into Egypt. The
carrying away of the images of the gods was a usual custom with
conquerors; cf. [Isa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md)., [Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md); [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md). In the images the gods
themselves were carried away; therefore they are called "their gods."
נסכיהם signifies here not drink-offerings, but molten images; the form
is analogous to the plur. פּסילים, formed from פּסל; on the contrary,
נסיכם libationes, [Deu 32:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#038.md), stands
for נסכּיהם, [Isa 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029.md). The suffix is
not to be referred to אלהים, but, like the suffix in חמדּתם, to the
inhabitants of the conquered country. וזהב כּסף are in apposition to
חמדּתם כּלי, not the genitive of the subject (Kran.), because an
attributive genitive cannot follow a noun determined by a suffix. Hv.,
v. Leng., Maurer, Hitzig, Ewald, and Klief. translate 'וגו יעמד שׁנים
והוּא: he shall during (some) years stand off from the king of the
north. Literally this translation may perhaps be justified, for עמד, c.
מן, [Gen 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#035.md), has the meaning of "to
leave off," and the expression "to stand off from war" may be used
concisely for "to desist from making war" upon one. But this
interpretation does not accord with the connection. First, it is opposed
by the expressive והוּא, which cannot be understood, if nothing further
should be said than that the king of the south, after he had overthrown
the fortresses of the enemies' country, and had carried away their gods
and their treasures, abstained from war for some years. The והוּא much
rather leads us to this, that the passage introduced by it states some
new important matter which does not of itself appear from the
subjugation of the enemy and his kingdom. To this is to be added, that
the contents of [Dan 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#009.md), where the
subject to בּא can only be the king of the north, do not accord with the
abstaining of the king of the south from warring against the king of the
north. By Ewald's remark, "With such miserable marchings to and fro they
mutually weaken themselves," the matter is not made intelligible. For
the penetrating of the king of the south into the fortresses of his
enemy, and the carrying away of his gods and his treasures, was not a
miserable, useless expedition; but then we do not understand how the
completely humbled king of the north, after his conqueror abstained from
war, was in the condition to penetrate into his kingdom and then to
return to his own land. Would his conqueror have suffered him to do
this? We must, therefore, with Kranichfeld, Gesenius, de Wette, and
Winer, after the example of the Syriac and Vulgate, take מן יעמד in the
sense of: to stand out before, מן in the sense of מפּני, contra, as in
[Psa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md) it is construed with ריב,
which is supported by the circumstance that עמד in [Dan
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md), [Dan
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#015.md), [Dan
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#017.md), and [Dan
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025.md), has this meaning. By this not
only is והוּא rightly translated: and he, the same who penetrated into
the fortresses of his adversary and carried away his gods, shall also
take his stand against him, assert his supremacy for years; but also
[Dan 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#009.md) contains a suitable
addition, for it shows how he kept his ground. The king of the north
shall after some time invade the kingdom of the king of the south, but
shall return to his own land, namely, because he can effect nothing.
Kran. takes the king of the south as the subject to וּבא, [Dan
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#009.md); but this is impossible, for then
the word must be בּמלכוּתו, particularly in parallelism with אדמתו. As
the words stand, הנגב מלך, can only be the genitive to בּמלכוּת; thus
the supposition that "the king of the south is the subject" is excluded,
because the expression, "the king of the south comes into the kingdom of
the south and returns to his own land," has no meaning when, according
to the context, the south denotes Egypt. With the וּבא there also begins
a change of the subject, which, though it appears contrary to the idiom
of the German \[and English\] language, is frequently found in Hebrew;
e.g., in [Dan 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#011.md) and [Dan
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#009.md). By the mention of an expedition
of the king of the north into the kingdom of the king of the south, from
which he again returned without having effected anything, the way is
opened for passing to the following description of the supremacy of the
king of the north over the king of the south.

[Daniel 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 11:10</span></span>

The decisive wars - [Dan 11:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010.md)

Here the suffix in בּנו refers to the king of the north, who in [Dan
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#009.md) was the person acting. Thus all
interpreters with the exception of Kranichfeld, who understand בנו of
the son of the Egyptian prince, according to which this verse ought to
speak of the hostilities sought, in the wantonness of his own mind, of
the king of the south against the king of the north. But this
interpretation of Kranichfeld is shattered, not to speak of other verbal
reasons which oppose it, against the contents of [Dan
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#011.md). The rage of the king of the
south, and his going to war against the king of the north, supposes that
the latter had given rise to this rage by an assault. Besides, the
description given in [Dan 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010.md) is
much too grand to be capable of being referred to hostility exercised in
mere wantonness. For such conflicts we do not assemble a multitude of
powerful armies, and, when these powerful hosts penetrate into the
fortresses of the enemy's country, then find that for the victorious
invaders there is wanting the occasion of becoming exasperated for new
warfare. The Kethiv בנו is rightly interpreted by the Masoretes as
plur., which the following verbs demand, while the singulars ועבר ושׁטף
וּבא (shall come, and overflow, and pass through) are explained from the
circumstance that the hosts are viewed unitedly in המון (multitude).
בּוא בּא expresses the unrestrained coming or pressing forward, while
the verbs ועבר שׁטף, reminding us of [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md), describe pictorially the
overflowing of the land by the masses of the hostile army. וישׁב
(jussive, denoting the divine guidance), and shall return, expresses the
repetition of the deluge of the land by the hosts marching back out of
it after the עבּר, the march through the land, - not the new arming for
war (Hv.), but renewed entrance into the region of the enemy, whereby
they carry on the war מעזּה עד, to the fortress of the king of the
south, corresponding with the הצּפון מלך בּמעוז in [Dan
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007.md) (to the fortress of the king of
the north). יתגּרוּ signifies properly to stir up to war, i.e., to arm,
then to engage in war. In the first member of the verse it has the
former, and in the last the latter meaning. The violent pressing forward
of the adversary will greatly embitter the king of the south, fill him
with the greatest anger, so that he will go out to make war with him.
The adversary marshals a great multitude of combatants; but these shall
be given into his hand, into the hand of the king of the south. רב המון
העמיד (he raised up a great multitude) the context requires us to refer
to the king of the north. בּידו נתּן, v. Leng., Maurer, and Hitzig
understand of the acceptance of the command over the army - contrary to
the usage of the words, which mean, to give into the hand = to deliver
up, cf. [Kg1 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#028.md); [Dan
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002.md); [Dan
8:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012.md), and is contrary also to the
context. The marshalling of the host supposes certainly the power to
direct it, so that it needs not then for the first time to be given into
the power of him who marshalled it. The expression also, "to give into
his hand," as meaning "to place under his command," is not found in
Scripture. To this is to be added, that the article in ההמון refers back
to רב המון. But if ההמון is the host assembled by the king of the north,
then it can only be given up into the hand of the enemy, i.e., the king
of the south, and thus the suffix in בּידו can only refer to him. The
statements in [Dan 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#012.md) are in
harmony with this, so far as they confessedly speak of the king of the
south.

[Daniel 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 11:12</span></span>

This verse illustrates the last clause of [Dan
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#011.md), i.e., explains more fully how
the great multitude of the enemy are given into his hand. The first two
clauses of [Dan 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#012.md) stand in
correlation to each other, as the change of the time and the absence of
the copula before ירוּם show (the Keri ורם proceeds from a
misunderstanding). The meaning is this: "As the multitude rises up, so
his heart is lifted up." ההמון, with the article, can only be the host
of the king of the north mentioned in [Dan
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#012.md). The supposition that the
Egyptian army is meant, is the result of the difficulty arising out of
the misapprehension of the right relation in which the perfect ונשּׂא
(hath lifted up raised) stands to the imperfect ירוּם. נשּׂא as in [Isa
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010.md) : they raise themselves to the
conflict. לבב רוּם, the lifting up of the heart, commonly in the sense
of pride; here the increase of courage, but so that pride is not
altogether to be excluded. The subject to ירוּם is the king of the
south, to whom the suffix to בּידו, [Dan
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#011.md), points. With excited courage he
overthrows myriads, namely, the powerful multitude of the enemies, but
he yet does not reach to power, he does not attain to the supremacy over
the king of the north and over his kingdom which he is striving after.
The Vulgate, without however fully expressing the meaning, has rendered
יעוז ולא by sed non praevalebit.

[Daniel 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 11:13</span></span>

This thought is expanded and proved in these verses. - [Dan
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013.md). The king of the north returns
to his own land, gathers a host together more numerous than before, and
shall then, at the end of the times of years, come again with a more
powerful army and with a great train. רכוּשׁ, that which is acquired,
the goods, is the train necessary for the suitable equipment of the
army-"the condition to a successful warlike expedition" (Kran.). The
definition of time corresponding to the בּעתּים in [Dan
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md) is specially to be observed:
שׁנים העתּים לקץ הע (at the end of times, years), in which שׁנים is to
be interpreted (as ימים with שׁבעים, [Dan
10:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#003.md), and other designations of
time) as denoting that the \`itiym stretch over years, are times lasting
during years. העתּים, with the definite article, are in prophetic
discourse the times determined by God.

[Dan 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014.md)

In those times shall many rise up against the king of the south (על עמד
as [Dan 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#020).md); also עמך פריצי בּני,
the violent people of the nation (of the Jews), shall raise themselves
against him. פריצים .mih ts בּני are such as belong to the classes of
violent men who break through the barriers of the divine law ([Eze
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#010).md). These shall raise themselves
חזון להעמיד, to establish the prophecy, i.e., to bring it to an
accomplishment. ha\`amiyd = qayeem, [Eze
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#006.md), as עמד = קוּם in Daniel, and
generally in the later Hebrew. Almost all interpreters since Jerome have
referred this to Daniel's vision of the oppression under Antiochus
Epiphanes, [Dan 8:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md), [Dan
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023.md). This is so far right, as the
apostasy of one party among the Jews from the law of their fathers, and
their adoption of heathen customs, contributed to bring about that
oppression with which the theocracy was visited by Antiochus Epiphanes;
but the limiting of the חזון to those definite prophecies is too narrow.
חזון without the article is prophecy in undefined generality, and is to
be extended to all the prophecies which threatened the people of Israel
with severe chastisements and sufferings on account of their falling
away from the law and their apostasy from their God. ונכשׁלוּ, they
shall stumble, fall. "The falling away shall bring to them no gain, but
only the sufferings and tribulation prophesied of" (Kliefoth).

[Dan 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#015.md)

In this verse, with ויבא the בּוא eht וי יבוא, [Dan
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013.md), is again assumed, and the
consequence of the war announced. סוללה שׁפך, to heap up an
entrenchment; cf. [Eze 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002.md); [Kg2
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032.md). מבצרות עיר, city of
fortifications, without the article, also collectively of the fortresses
of the kingdom of the south generally. Before such power the army, i.e.,
the war-strength, of the south shall not maintain its ground; even his
chosen people shall not possess strength necessary for this.

The Further Undertakings of the King of the North - [Dan
11:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016.md)

Having penetrated into the kingdom of the south, he shall act there
according to his own pleasure, without any one being able to withstand
him; just as before this the king of the south did in the kingdom of the
north ([Dan 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007).md). With ויעשׂ the
jussive appears instead of the future - cf. וישׂם, יתּן ([Dan
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#017).md), ישׁב ([Dan
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#018.md) and [Dan
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#019).md) - to show that the further
actions and undertakings of the king of the north are carried on under
the divine decree. אליו הבּא is he that comes into the land of the
south, the king of the north ([Dan
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014.md), [Dan
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#015).md). Having reached the height of
victory, he falls under the dominion of pride and haughtiness, by which
he hastens on his ruin and overthrow. After he has subdued the kingdom
of the southern king, he will go into the land of beauty, i.e., into the
Holy Land (with reference to הצּבי ארץ, [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009).md). בּידו וכלה, and destruction is
in his hand (an explanatory clause), כלה being here not a verb, but a
substantive. Only this meaning of כלה is verbally established, see under
[Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md), but not the meaning
attributed to the word, from the unsuitable introduction of historical
events, accomplishing, perfection, according to which Hv., v. Leng.,
Maur., and Kliefoth translate the clause: and it (the Holy Land) is
wholly given into his hand. כלה means finishing, conclusion, only in the
sense of destruction, also in [Ch2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002.md) and [Eze
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#013.md). For the use of בּידו of
spiritual things which one intends or aims at, cf. [Job
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#014.md), Isa. 54:20. The destruction,
however, refers not to the Egyptians (Hitzig), but to the Holy Land, in
which violent (rapacious) people ([Dan
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014).md) make common cause with the
heathen king, and thereby put arms into his hands by which he may
destroy the land.

[Daniel 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 11:17</span></span>

This verse has been very differently expounded. According to the example
of Jerome, who translates it: et ponet faciem suam ut veniat ad tenendum
universum regnum ejus, and adds to this the explanatory remark: ut
evertat illum h. e. Ptolemaeum, sive illud, h. e. regnum ejus, many
translate the words וגו בּתקף לבוא by to come in or against the strength
of his whole (Egyptian) kingdom (C. B. Michaelis, Venema, Hvernick, v.
Lengerke, Maurer), i.e., to obtain the superiority over the Egyptian
kingdom (Kliefoth). But this last interpretation is decidedly opposed by
the circumstance that תּקף means strength not in the active sense =
power over something, but only in the intransitive or passive sense,
strength as the property of any one. Moreover, both of these
explanations are opposed by the verbal use of בּוא c. ב rei, which does
not signify: to come in or against a matter, but: to come with - cf.
בּחיל בּוא, to come with power, [Dan
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013.md), also [Isa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010.md); [Psa
71:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#016.md) - as well as by the context, for
of the completely subjugated south (according to [Dan
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#015.md), [Dan
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016).md) it cannot yet be said מלכוּתו
תּקף. Correctly, Theodot. translates: εἰσελθεῖν ἐν ἰσχύι" πάσης τῆς
βασιλείας αὐτοῦ; Luther: "to come with the strength of his whole
kingdom." Similarly M. Geier, Hitzig, and Kran. The king of the north
intends thus to come with the force of his whole kingdom to obtain full
possession of the kingdom of the south. עמּו וישׁרים is an explanatory
clause defining the manner in which he seeks to gain his object. ישׁרים,
plur. of the adjective ישׁר, in a substantive signification, that which
is straight, recta, as [Pro 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#013.md),
proba (Ewald's Gram. 172; while in his commentary he translates the word
by agreement). עמּו, with him, i.e., having in intention. The sense of
the passage is determined according to מישׁרים לעשׂות, [Dan
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md) : with the intention of
establishing a direct, right relation, namely, by means of a political
marriage to bring to himself the kingdom of the south. ועשׂה forms a
clause by itself: he shall do it, carry it out; there is therefore no
need for Hitzig's arbitrary change of the text into יעשׂה.

The second half of this verse ([Dan
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#017).md) describes how he carries out
this intention, but yet does not reach his end. "He shall give him the
daughter of women." הנּשׁים, of women, the plur. of the class, as אריות
כּפיר, [Jdg 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005.md), a young lion (of
lionesses); בּן אתנות, [Zac 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md), the
foal of an ass (of she-asses). The suffix to להשׁחיתהּ (corrupting her,
E.V.) is referred by many to מלכוּתו (his kingdom); but this reference
fails along with the incorrect interpretation of the בּתקף as the end of
the coming. Since in the first half of the verse the object of his
undertaking is not named, but in [Dan
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016.md) is denoted by אליו, the suffix
in question can only be referred to הנּשׁים בּת. Thus J. D. Michaelis,
Bertholdt, Rosenmller; the former, however, gives to the word להשׁחיתהּ
the verbally untenable meaning: "to seduce her into a morally corrupt
course of conduct;" but Hitzig changes the text, strikes out the suffix,
and translates: "to accomplish vileness." השׁחית means only to destroy,
to ruin, hence "to destroy her" (Kran.). This, it is true, was not the
object of the marriage, but only its consequence; but the consequence is
set forth as had in view, so as forcibly to express the thought that the
marriage could lead, according to a higher direction, only to the
destruction of the daughter.

The last clauses of the verse express the failure of the measure
adopted. The verbs are fem., not neut.; thus the meaning is not: "it
shall neither stand, nor succeed to him" (v. Leng., Maurer, Hitzig),
but: "she (the daughter) shall not stand," not be able to carry out the
plan contemplated by her father. The words תּהיה ולא־לו do not stand for
לו (&lt;) תּהיה ולא: "she shall not be to him" or "for him." In this
case לא must be connected with the verb. According to the text, לא־לו
forms one idea, as כּוח לא, impotent (cf. Ewald, 270): "she shall be a
not for him" (ein Nichtihm), i.e., he shall have nothing at all from
her.

[Daniel 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 11:18</span></span>

His fate further drives him to make an assault on the islands and
maritime coasts of the west (איּים), many of which he takes. וישׁב is
not, after the Keri, to be changed into וישׂם; for turning himself from
Egypt to the islands, he turns back his face toward his own land in the
north. The two following clauses are explained by most interpreters
thus: "but a captain shall stop his scorn (bring it to silence), and
moreover shall give back (recompense) scorn to him in return." This is
then, according to the example of Jerome, referred to the expedition of
Antiochus Epiphanes against the Grecian islands which were under the
protection of Rome, for which he was assailed and overcome by the consul
Lucius Scipio (Asiaticus) in a battle fought at Magnesia ad Sipylum in
Lydia. But the translation in question affords a tolerable sense only
when we take בּלתּי in the meaning moreover, in addition to; a meaning
which it has not, and cannot have according to its etymology. In all
places where it is so rendered a negative sentence goes before it, cf.
[Gen 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#003.md); [Gen
47:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#018.md); [Jdg
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#014.md), or a sentence asking a question
with a negative sense, as [Amo 3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#003.md);
according to which, לא must here stand before השׁבּית if we would
translate it by besides that or only. בּלתּי has the idea of exception,
and can only be rendered after an affirmative statement by however, for
the passage introduced by its limits the statement going before. Thus
Theodot. rightly: καταπαύσει ἄρχοντας ὀνειδισμοῦ αὐτῶν, πλὴν ὁ
ὀνειδισμὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπιστρέψει αὐτῷ; and in close connection with this,
Jerome has: et cessare faciet principem opprobrii sui et opprobrium ejus
convertetur in eum. In like manner the Peshito. This rendering we must,
with Kranichfeld, accede to, and accordingly understand וגו והשׁבּית of
the king of the north, and interpret the indefinite קצין (leader, chief)
in undefined generality or collectively, and חרפּתו (his reproach) as
the second object subordinated to קצין, and refer לו as the dative to
קצין. Thus the second חרפּתו gains expressiveness corresponding to its
place before the verb as the contrast to לו (&lt;) חרפּתו: "however his
reproach," i.e., the dishonour he did to the chiefs, "shall they
recompense to him." The subject to ישׁיב is the collective קצין. The
statement of the last clause introduces us to the announcement,
mentioned in [Dan 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#019.md), of the
overthrow of the king of the north, who wished to spread his power also
over the west. Since the chiefs (princes) of the islands rendered back
to him his reproach, i.e., required to him his attack against them, he
was under the necessity of returning to the fortresses of his own land.
With that begins his fall, which ends with his complete destruction.

[Daniel 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 11:20</span></span>

Another stands up in his place, who causeth נוגשׂ to pass over, through
his eagerness for riches. נוגשׂ most understand as a collector of
tribute, referring for this to [Kg2
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#035.md), and מלכוּת הדר מלכוּת as the
Holy Land, and then think on Heliodorus, whom Seleucus Nicator sent to
Jerusalem to seize the temple treasure. But this interpretation of the
words is too limited. נגשׂ denotes, no doubt ([Kg2
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#035).md), to collect gold and silver;
but it does not thence follow that נוגשׂ, when silver and gold are not
spoken of, means to collect tribute. The word in general designates the
taskmaster who urges on the people to severe labour, afflicts and
oppresses them as cattle. מלכוּת הדר is not synonymous with הצּבי ארץ,
[Dan 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016.md), but stands much nearer to
מלכוּת הוד, [Dan 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md), and designates
the glory of the kingdom. The glory of the kingdom was brought down by
נוגשׂ, and העביר refers to the whole kingdom of the king spoken of, not
merely to the Holy Land, which formed but a part of his kingdom. By
these oppressions of his kingdom he prepared himself in a short time for
destruction. אחדים ימים (days few), as in [Gen
27:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#044.md); [Gen
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#020.md), the designation of a very short
time. The reference of these words, "in days few," to the time after the
pillage of the temple of Jerusalem by Heliodorus is not only an
arbitrary proceeding, but is also contrary to the import of the words,
since ב in בּימים does not mean post. מאפּים ולא, in contradistinction
and contrast to במלחמה ולא, can only denote private enmity or private
revenge. "Neither by anger (i.e., private revenge) nor by war" points to
an immediate divine judgment.

If we now, before proceeding further in our exposition, attentively
consider the contents of the revelation of vv. 5-20, so as to have a
clear view of its relation to the historical fulfilment, we shall find
the following to be the course of the thoughts exhibited: - After the
fall of the Javanic world-kingdom ([Dan
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004).md) the king of the south shall
attain to great power, and one of his princes shall found ([Dan
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005).md) a yet greater dominion in the
north. After the course of years they shall enter into an agreement, for
the king of the south shall give his daughter in marriage to the king of
the north so as to establish a right relationship between them; but this
agreement shall bring about the destruction of the daughter, as well as
of her father and all who co-operated for the effecting of this marriage
([Dan 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006).md). Hereupon a descendant of
that king of the south shall undertake a war against the king of the
north, victoriously invade the country of the adversary, gather together
great spoil and carry it away to Egypt, and for years hold the
supremacy. The king of the north shall, it is true, penetrate into his
kingdom, but he shall again return home without effecting anything ([Dan
11:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007).md). His sons also shall pass over
the kingdom of the south with a multitude of hosts, but the multitude
shall be given into the hand of the king, who shall not come to power by
casting down myriads. The king of the north shall return with a host yet
more numerous; against the king of the south many, also faithless
members of the Jewish nation, shall rise up, and the king of the north
shall take the fortified cities, without the king of the south having
the power to offer him resistance ([Dan
11:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010).md). The conqueror shall now
rule in the conquered lands after his own pleasure, and set his foot on
the Holy Land with the intention of destroying it. Thereupon he shall
come with the whole might of his kingdom against the king of the south,
and by the marriage of his daughter seek to establish a right
relationship with him, but he shall only thereby bring about the
destruction of his daughter. Finally, he shall make an assault against
the islands and the maritime countries of the west; but he shall be
smitten by his chiefs, and be compelled to return to the fortresses of
his own land, and shall fall ([Dan
11:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016).md). But his successor, who
shall send taskmasters through the most glorious regions of the kingdom,
shall be destroyed in a short time ([Dan
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#020).md).

Thus the revelation depicts how, in the war of the kings of the south
and of the north, first the king of the south subdued the north, but
when at the summit of his conquest he sank under the power of his
adversary through the insurrections and the revolt of an apostate party
of the Jews; whereupon, by an assault upon the west in his endeavour,
after a firmer establishment and a wider extension of his power, he
brings about his own overthrow, and his successor, in consequence of the
oppression of his kingdom, comes to his end in a few days.

Now, since the king who comes into his place ([Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021)..md) after he has become strong
raises himself up against the holy covenant, takes away the daily
worship in the temple of the Lord, etc., is, according to the historical
evidence found in the books of the Maccabees, the Seleucidan Antiochus
Epiphanes, so the prophetic announcement, vv. 5-20, stretches itself
over the period from the division of the monarchy of Alexander among his
generals to the commencement of the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes in the
year 175 b.c., during which there reigned seven Syrian and six Egyptian
kings, viz. -

Syrian Kings (from b.c.) Egyptian Kings (from b.c.) Seleucus Nicator
310-280 Ptolemy Lagus 323-284 Antiochus Sidetes 280-260 Ptolemy
Philadelphus 284 Antiochus Theus 260-245 Ptolemy Euergetes 246-221
Seleucus Callinicus 245-225 Ptolemy Philopator 221-204 Seleucis Ceraunus
225-223 Ptolemy Epiphanes 204-180 Antiochus the Great 223-186 Ptolemy
Philometor 180

But in the prophetic revelation there is mention made of only four kings
of the north (one in [Dan 11:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005.md); his
sons, [Dan 11:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010.md); a third, [Dan
11:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013.md); and the fourth, [Dan
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#020).md) and three kings of the south
(the first, [Dan 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005.md) and [Dan
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md); the "branch," [Dan
11:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007.md); and the king, [Dan
11:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010).md), distinctly different,
whereby of the former, the relation of the sons ([Dan
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010).md) to the king indefinitely
mentioned in [Dan 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#011.md), is admitted,
and of the latter the kings of the south, it remains doubtful whether he
who is spoken of in [Dan 11:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#009.md) is
different from or is identical with "the branch of her roots" ([Dan
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007).md). This circumstance shows that
the prophecy does not treat of individual historical personages, but
only places in view the king of the south and the king of the north as
representatives of the power of these two kingdoms. Of these kings
special deeds and undertakings are indeed mentioned, which point to
definite persons; e.g., of the king of the north, that he was one of the
princes of the king of the south, and founded a greater dominion than
his ([Dan 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005).md); the marriage of the
daughter of the king of the south to the king of the north ([Dan
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006).md); afterwards the marriage also of
the daughter of the king of the north ([Dan
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#017).md), and other special
circumstances in the wars between the two, which are to be regarded not
merely as individualizing portraitures, but denote concrete facts which
have verified themselves in history. But yet all these specialities do
not establish the view that the prophecy consists of a series of
predictions of historical facta, because even these features of the
prophecy which find their actual fulfilments in history do not coincide
with the historical reality.

Thus all interpreters regard the king of the south, [Dan
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005.md), as Ptolemy Lagus, and that one
of his princes (מן־שׂריו) who founded a greater dominion as Seleucus
Nicator, or the "Conqueror," who, in the division of the countries which
the conquerors made after the overthrow and death of Antiochus,
obtained, according to Appian, Syr. c. 55, Syria from the Euphrates to
the Mediterranean Sea and Phrygia; then by using every opportunity of
enlarging his kingdom, he obtained also Mesopotamia, Armenia, and a part
of Cappadocia, and besides subjugated the Persians, Parthians,
Bactrains, Arabians, and other nations as far as the Indus, which
Alexander had conquered; so that, after Alexander, no one had more
nations of Asia under his sway than Seleucus, for from the borders of
Phyrgia to the Indus all owned his sway. While this extension of his
kingdom quite harmonizes with the prophecy of the greatness of his
sovereignty, yet the designation "one of his princes" does not accord
with the position of Ptolemy Lagus. Both of these were certainly at the
beginning generals of Alexander. Seleucus, afterwards vicegerent of the
Babylonians, found himself, however, from fear of Antigonus, who sought
to put him to death, under the necessity of fleeing to Egypt to Ptolemy,
by whom he was hospitably received, and with whom and other vicegerents
he entered into a league against Antigonus, and when war arose, led an
Egyptian fleet against Antigonus (Diod. Sic. xix. 55-62). He was
accordingly not one of Ptolemy's generals.

Moreover, the marriage of the king's daughter, [Dan
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md), is thus explained by Jerome, and
all interpreters who follow him: - Ptolemy Philadelphus made peace with
Antiochus Theus, after many years' war, on the condition that Antiochus
should put away his own wife Laodice, who was at the same time his
half-sister, and disinherit her son, and should marry Berenice, the
daughter of Ptolemy, and should appoint her first-born son as his
successor on the throne of the kingdom (Appian, Syr. c. 65, and Jerome).
This factum can be regarded as a fulfilling of the prophecy, [Dan
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md); but the consequences which
resulted from this political marriage do not correspond with the
consequences prophesied of. According to the testimony of history,
Ptolemy died two years after this marriage, whereupon Antiochus set
aside Berenice, and took to himself again his former wife Laodice, along
with her children. But she effected the death of her husband by poison,
as she feared his fickleness, and then her son Seleucus Callinicus
ascended the throne. Berenice fled with her son to the asylum of Daphne,
but she was there murdered along with him. The prophecy, according to
this, differs from the historical facts, not merely in regard to the
consequences of the events, but also in regard to the matter itself; for
it speaks not only of the daughter, but also of her father being given
up to death, while the natural death of her father is in no respect
connected with that marriage, and not till after his death did the
consequences fatal to his daughter and her child develop themselves.

Further, as to the contents of [Dan
11:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007.md), history furnishes the
following confirmations: - In order to save his sister, who was put
aside by Antiochus Theus, her brother, Ptolemy Euergetes, invaded the
Syrian kingdom, in which Seleucus Callinicus had succeeded his father on
the throne, in alliance with the armies of the Asiatic cities, and put
to death his mother Laodice, since he had come too late to save his
sister, in revenge for her murder, overthrew all the Syrian fortresses
from Cilicia to the Tigris and Babylonia, and would have conquered the
whole of the Syrian kingdom, if an insurrection which had broken out in
Egypt had not caused him to return thither, carrying with him many
images of the gods, and immense treasure, which he had taken from the
vanquished cities. Then, while engaged in Egypt, Callinicus recovered
the cities of Asia Minor, but failed to conquer the maritime countries,
because his fleet was wrecked in a storm; and when he thereupon
undertook a land expedition against Egypt, he was totally defeated, so
that he returned to Antioch with only a few followers: cf. Justin, Hist.
xxvii. 1, 2; Polyb. v. 58; and Appian, Syr. c. 65. On the other hand,
the announcement of the war of his sons with many hosts overflowing the
land, [Dan 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010.md), is not confirmed by
history. After the death of Callinicus in captivity, his son Seleucus
Ceraunus succeeded to the government, a very incompetent man, who after
tow years was poisoned by his generals in the war with Attalus, without
having undertaken anything against Egypt. His brother Antiochus,
surnamed the Great, succeeded him, who, in order to recover Coele-Syria
and Phoenicia, renewed the war against the king of Egypt (not till about
two years after he ascended the throne, however, did Ptolemy Philopator
begin to reign), in which he penetrated twice to Dura, two (German)
miles north from Caesarea (Polyb. x. 49), then concluded a four months'
truce, and led his host back to the Orontes (Polyb. v. 66; Justin, xxx.
1). After the renewal of hostilities he drove the Egyptian army back to
Sidon, conquered Gilead and Samaria, and took up his winter-quarters in
Ptolemais (Polyb. v. 63-71). In the beginning of the following year,
however, he was defeated by the Egyptians at Raphia, not far from Gaza,
and was compelled, with great loss in dead and prisoners, to return as
quickly as possible to Antioch, and to leave Coele-Syria, Phoenicia, and
Palestine to the Egyptians (Polyb. v. 79, 80, 82-86). [Dan
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#011.md) and [Dan
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#012.md) refer to this war. Thirteen our
fourteen years after this, Antiochus, in league with Philip III of
Macedon, renewed the war against the Egyptians, when, after Philopator's
death, Ptolemy Epiphanes, being five years old, had ascended the throne,
retook the three above-named countries (Coele-Syria, Phoenicia, and
Palestine), vanquished the Egyptian host led by Scopas near Paneas, and
compelled the fortress of Sidon, into which the Egyptians had fled, to
surrender after a lengthened siege, and then concluded a peace with
Ptolemy on the condition that he took to wife the daughter of Antiochus,
Cleopatra, who should bring with her, as her dowry, Coele-Syria,
Phoenicia, and Palestine (Polyb. xv. 20, xxviii. 17; App. Syr. c. i.;
Liv. xxxiii. 19; and Joseph. Antt. xii. 4. 1). Since the time of Jerome,
the prophecy [Dan 11:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013.md) has been
referred to this last war. But also here the historical events fall far
behind the contents of the prophecy. The prophecy points to the complete
subjugation of the king of the south, while this war was carried on only
for the possession of the Asiatic provinces of the Egyptian kingdom.
Also the rising up of many (רבּים, [Dan
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014).md) against the king of the south
is not historically verified; and even the relation spoken of by
Josephus (Antt. xii. 3. 3) in which the Jews stood to Antiochus the
Great was not of such a kind as to be capable of being regarded as a
fulfilling of the "exalting themselves" of the פריצים בּני, [Dan
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014.md). Still less does the statement
of [Dan 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016.md), that the king of the
north would stand in the glorious land, agree with כּלה interpreted of
conduct of Antiochus the Great toward the Jews; for according to
Josephus, Antt. l.c., he treated the Jews round about Jerusalem
favourably, because of their own accord they had submitted to him and
had supported his army, and granted to them not only indulgence in
regard to the observance of their religious ordinances, but also
afforded them protection.

Moreover, [Dan 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#018.md), containing the
prophecy of the undertaking of the king of the north against the
islands, has not its historical fulfilment in the expedition of
Antiochus the Great against the coasts and islands of Asia Minor and the
Hellespont; but [Dan 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#019.md), that which
is said regarding his return to the fortresses of his own land and his
overthrow, does not so correspond with the historical issues of the
reign of this king that one would be able to recognise therein a
prediction of it. Finally, of his successor, Seleucus Philopator, to
whom [Dan 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#020.md) must refer, if the
foregoing verses treat of Antiochus the Great, nothing further is
communicated, than that he quum paternis cladibus fractas admodum Syriae
opes accepisset, post otiosum nullisque admodum rebus gestis nobilitatum
annorum duodecim regnum, was put to death through the treachery of
Heliodorus, unius ex purpuratis (Liv. xli. 19, cf. App. Syr. c. 45), and
the mission of Heliodorus to Jerusalem to seize the treasures of the
temple, which is fabulously described in 2 Macc. 3:4ff. The ישּׁבר
(shall be destroyed) of this king אחדים בּימים (within few days) does
not harmonize with the fact of his twelve years' reign.

From this comparison this much follows, that the prophecy does not
furnish a prediction of the historical wars of the Seleucidae and the
Ptolemies, but an ideal description of the war of the kings of the north
and the south in its general outlines, whereby, it is true, diverse
special elements of the prophetical announcement have historically been
fulfilled, but the historical reality does not correspond with the
contents of the prophecy in anything like an exhaustive manner. This
ideal character of the prophecy comes yet more prominently forward to
view in the following prophetic description.

[Daniel 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md)

The further Unveiling of the Future

In this section we have ([Dan 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021).md)
first the description of the prince who, in striving after supremacy,
sues all the means that cunning and power can contrive, and in his
enmity against the holy covenant knows no bounds. This description is
divided into two parts - (1) [Dan
11:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021), and (2.md) vv. 36-12:3-which
designate the two stadia of his proceedings. In the first part are
described, (1) his gradual rising to power, [Dan
11:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021); (2.md) his war with the king of
the south for the supremacy, [Dan
11:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025); (3.md) his rising up against
the covenant people, even to the desecration of the sanctuary by the
taking away of the daily sacrifice and the setting up of the abomination
of desolation, [Dan 11:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028); (4.md) the
effect and consequence of this for the people of God, [Dan
11:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032.md). This prince is the enemy of
the holy God who is prophesied of in [Dan
8:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md), [Dan
8:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023.md), under the figure of the
little horn, and is typically represented in the rising up of the Syrian
king Antiochus Epiphanes against the covenant people and their worship
of God.

The prince's advancement to power. - He appears as נבזה, one despised,
i.e., not such an one as by reason of birth has any just claim to the
throne, and therefore as an intruder, also one who finds no recognition
(Kranichfeld); which Hitzig has more definitely explained by mentioning
that not Antiochus Epiphanes, but his nephew Demetrius, the son of the
murdered Seleucus Philopator, was the true heir, but was of such a
character that he was not esteemed worthy of the throne. נבזה, is
despised, not = bad, unworthy, but yet supposes unworthiness. There was
not laid on him the honour or majesty of the kingdom. The dignity of the
kingdom requires הוד, splendour, majesty, such as God lays upon the king
of Israel, [Psa 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006) (5.md), [Ch1
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#025.md). But here the subject spoken of
is the honour which men give to the king, and which was denied to the
"despised one" on account of his character. He comes בּשׁלוה, in
security, i.e., unexpectedly (cf. [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025).md), and takes possession of the
kingdom. החזיק, to grasp, here to draw violently to himself. בּחלקלקּות,
properly, by smoothnesses, intrigues and cunning, not merely flatteries
or smooth words, but generally hypocritical behaviour in word and deed;
cf. [Dan 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#034.md).

[Dan 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022.md)

The kingdom he seized he also knew how to hold fast with great power.
השׁטף זרעות, arms (i.e., warlike strength) of an inundation, i.e.,
armies overflowing the land are swept away before him, destroyed by yet
stronger military forces. It is not merely the enemy, but also the
"prince of the covenant," whom he destroys. בּרית נגיד is analogous to
בּרית בּעלי, [Gen 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013.md), and בּרית
אנשׁי, [Oba 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#007.md), cf. [Mal
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014.md), and, as the absence of the
article shows, is to be taken in a general sense. The interpretation of
בּרית נגיד of the high priest Onias III, who at the commencement of the
reign of Antiochus Epiphanes was driven from his office by his brother,
and afterwards, at the instigation of Menelaus, was murdered by the
Syrian governor Andronicus at Daphne near Antioch, 2 Macc. 4:1ff., 33ff.
(Rosenmller, Hitzig, etc.) - this interpretation is not warranted by the
facts of history. This murder does not at all relate to the matter
before us, not only because the Jewish high priest at Antioch did not
sustain the relation of a "prince of the covenant," but also because the
murder was perpetrated without the previous knowledge of Antiochus, and
when the matter was reported to him, the murderer was put to death by
his command (2 Macc. 4:36-38). Thus also it stands in no connection with
the war of Antiochus against Egypt. The words cannot also (with
Hvernick, v. Leng., Maurer, Ebrard, Kliefoth) be referred to the
Egyptian king Ptolemy Philometor, because history knows nothing of a
covenant entered into between this king and Antiochus Epiphanes, but
only that soon after the commencement of the reign of Antiochus
Epiphanes the guardians of the young Philometor demanded Coele-Syria
from Antiochus, which Antiochus the Great had promised as a dowry to his
daughter Cleopatra, who was betrothed to Ptolemy Philometor, but
Antiochus did not deliver it up, and hence a war arose between them. To
this is to be added, that, as Dereser, v. Lengerke, Maurer, and
Kranichfeld have rightly remarked, the description in [Dan
11:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022.md) bears an altogether general
character, so that v. Leng. and Maurer find therein references to all
the three expeditions of Antiochus, and in [Dan
11:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025.md) find more fully foretold what
is only briefly hinted at in [Dan
11:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022.md). The undertaking of the king
against Egypt is first described in [Dan
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#024.md). We must therefore, with
Kranichfeld, understand בּרית נגיד in undefined generality of covenant
princes in general, in the sense already given.

[Dan 11:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023.md)

In these verses there is a fuller statement of the manner in which he
treats the princes of the covenant and takes possession of their
territory. The וat the beginning of [Dan
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023.md) is explicative, and the suffix
in אליו, pointing back to נגיד ב, is also to be interpreted
collectively. אליו מן־התחבּרוּת, literally, "from the confederating
himself with them" (התחבּרוּת is infin. formed in the Syriac manner),
i.e., from the time when he had made a covenant with them, he practised
deceit. This was done by his coming (עלה of a warlike coming) and
gaining strength with a few people, namely ([Dan
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#024).md), by his coming unexpectedly
into the fattest and richest places of the province, and there doing
unheard-of things - things which no previous king, no one of his
predecessors, had ever done, scattering among them (his followers) spoil
and prey and riches. Thus rightly, after the Syriac and the Vulgate
(dissipabit), Rosenmller, Kranichfeld, and Ewald; while, on the
contrary, v. Leng., Maurer, Hitzig, and Kliefoth interpret בּזר in the
sense of to distribute, and refer the words to the circumstance that
Antiochus Epiphanes squandered money lavishly, and made presents to his
inferiors often without any occasion. But to distribute money and spoil
is nothing unheard of, and in no way does it agree with the "fattest
provinces." The contest decidedly refers to conduct which injured the
fat provinces. This can only consist in squandering and dissipating the
wealth of this province which he had plundered to its injury (להם \[to
them\], dativ. incommodi). An historical confirmation is found in 1
Macc. 3:29-31. To bring the provinces wholly under his power, he devises
plans against the fortresses that he might subdue them. ועד־עת, and
indeed (he did this) even for a time. We cannot, with Klief., refer this
merely to the last preceding passage, that his assaults against the
fortresses succeeded only partly and for a time. The addition ("and that
for a time") denotes a period determined by a higher power (cf. [Dan
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#024.md) and [Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md), [Dan
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006).md), and relates to the whole
proceedings of this prince hitherto described; as C. B. Michaelis has
already rightly explained: nec enim semper et in perpetuum dolus ei
succedet et terminus suus ei tandem erit.

[Daniel 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 11:25</span></span>

These verses describe the victorious war of the king who had come to
power against the king of the south, the war of Antiochus Epiphanes
against king Ptolemy Philometor, which is described in 1 Macc. 1:16-19,
with manifest reference to this prophecy. ויער (he shall stir up) is
potentialis in the sense of divine decree: "he shall stir up his power
and his heart." כּח is not warlike power, which is mentioned in
בּחיל־גּדול ([Dan 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025).md), but the
power which consists in the bringing of a great army under his command;
לבב, the mental energy for the carrying out of his plans. For יעמד לא,
cf. [Dan 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#004.md). The subject is the
last-named king of the south, who, notwithstanding his very great and
powerful army, shall not stand in battle, but shall give way, because
devices are contrived against him. The subject to יחשׁבוּ is not the
enemy, the king of the north, with his army, but, according to [Dan
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#026.md), his table-companions.

[Dan 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#026.md)

Here it is more definitely stated why he cannot stand. פתבּגו אכּלי, who
eat his food (פּתבּג, see under [Dan
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#005).md), i.e., his table-companions (cf.
[Psa 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010)\[9\].md), persons about him.
ישׁבּרוּהוּ, shall break him, i.e., cast him to the ground. His army
shall therefore overflow, but shall execute nothing, only many shall
fall down slain. The first member of the verse points to treachery,
whereby the battle was lost and the war was fruitless. Hitzig
incorrectly interprets ישׁטוף rushes away, i.e., is disorganized and
takes to flight. But שׁטף cannot have this meaning.

[Dan 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#027.md)

Here then is described how the two kings seek through feigned friendship
to destroy one another. The two kings are of course the two kings of the
north and the south previously named. Of a third, namely, of two kings
of Egypt, Philometor and Physkon, Daniel knows nothing. The third,
Physkon, is introduced from history; and hence Hitzig, v. Lengerke, and
others understand by the "two kings," the two kings Antiochus and
Philometor confederated against the king of the south, but Kliefoth, on
the contrary, thinks of Antiochus and Physkon, the latter of whom he
regards as the king of the south, [Dan
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025.md). All this is arbitrary. Jerome
has already rejected the historical evidence for this, and remarks:
verum ex eo, quia scriptura nunc dicit: duos fuisse reges, quorum cor
fuerit fraudulentum ... hoc secundum historiam demonstrari non potest.
למרע לבבם Hitzig translates: "their heart belongs to wickedness,"
contrary to the context. ל denotes also here only the direction: "their
heart goes toward wicked deeds," is directed thereto. מרע (from רעע),
formed after מצר (cf. Ewald, 160a), the evil-doing, consists in this,
that the one seeks to overthrow and destroy the other under the cloak of
feigned friendship; for they eat as friends at one table, and "speak
lies" - the one tells lies to the other, professing friendship. But
their design shall not succeed. All interpretations of these words which
are determined by historical facta are arbitrary. The history of
Antiochus Epiphanes furnishes no illustrations for this. In the sense of
the prophecy תצלח לא has only this meaning: the design of the king of
the north to destroy the king of the south, and to make himself master
both of the north and the south, shall not succeed, and the king of the
south will not fulfil what he promises to his deceitful adversary. For
yet the end shall be at the time appointed. These words state the reason
why the מרע shall not succeed. Hitzig incorrectly translates: "but the
end holds onwards to the appointed time;" for כּי cannot in this
connection be rendered by but, and ל cannot express the idea of holding
to anything. ל denotes here, as generally, the direction toward the end,
as [Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md), and [Dan
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md), [Dan
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019.md). The end goes yet on to the time
appointed by God. That this מועד (appointment of time) does not lie in
the present, but in the future, is denoted by עוד, although we do not,
with Hvernick, interpret עוד by "for the end lies yet further out," nor,
with v. Lengerke and Maurer, may we supply the verb "withdraws itself,
is reserved." עוד stands before קץ because on it the emphasis lies. קץ
is, however, not the end of the war between Antiochus and Egypt (v.
Leng., Maur., Hitzig), but cannot be otherwise taken than קץ עת, [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md), [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md), and [Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md). But in the latter passage קץ עת
is the time of the resurrection of the dead, thus the end of the present
course of the world, with which all the oppression of the people of God
ceases. Accordingly קץ in the verse before us, as in [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md), [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md), is the time in which the
conduct of the kings previously described, in their rising up and in
their hostility against the people of God, reaches its end ([Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045).md); and with the overthrow of
these enemies the period of oppression also comes to an end. This end
comes only למועד, at the time which God has determined for the purifying
of His people ([Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035).md). So long
may the kings of the north and the south prosecute their aims; so long
shall they strive for the possession of the kingdom without succeeding
in their plans. למועד has here and in [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md) the definite article, because in
both verses the language refers not to any definite time, but to the
time determined by God for the consummation of His kingdom. The placing
of the article in this word in the verse before us is not, with
Kliefoth, to be explained from a reference to [Dan
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md), [Dan
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019.md). The two revelations are
separated from each other by too long a space of time for this one to
refer back to that earlier one by the mere use of the article, although
both treat of the same subject. The למועד occurs besides in [Dan
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#029.md), where it is natural to suppose
that it has the same meaning as here; but the contents of the verse
oppose such a conclusion. [Dan 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#029.md)
treats, it is true, of a renewed warlike expedition against the south,
which, however, brings neither the final deciding of the war with the
south (cf. [Dan 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md), nor yet the
end of the oppression of the people of God; המועד is thus only the time
determined for the second aggression against the south, not the time of
the end.

[Daniel 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">dan 11:28</span></span>

The success gained by the crafty king of the north in his war against
the king of the south ([Dan 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025)..md)
increases his endeavours after the enlarging of his dominions. Returning
from Egypt with great riches, i.e., with rich spoil, he raises his heart
against the holy covenant. By the potentialis ישׁב (he shall return)
this new undertaking is placed in the point of view of a divine decree,
to denote that he thereby brings about his own destruction. קדשׁ בּרית
signifies not the holy people in covenant with God (v. Lengerke, Maurer,
and many older interpreters), but the divine institution of the Old
Covenant, the Jewish Theocracy. The Jews are only members of this
covenant, cf. [Dan 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md). Calvin is
right when he says: Mihi simplicior sensus probatur, quod scilicet
bellum gerat adversus Deum. The holy covenant is named instead of the
covenant people to represent the undertaking as an outrage against the
kingdom of God, which was founded in Israel. ועשׂה, and he shall do,
perform, that which his heart thinks, or that which he has in his mind
against the holy covenant. The historical fulfilment is narrated in 1
Macc. 1:22-29. לארצו ושׁב resumes ארצו וישׁב, and teaches us that
Antiochus undertook the first assault against the holy covenant on his
return from Egypt into his kingdom (to Antioch), as is expressly stated
in 1 Macc. 1:20.

[Daniel 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">dan 11:29</span></span>

In order that he might bring Egypt wholly under his power, he undertook
a new expedition thither (וּבא ישׁוּב, he comes again). But this
expedition, like the first, was not successful (כ־כ, as-so, cf. [Jos
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#011.md); [Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004).md). For the ships of Chittim come
against him. כּתּים ציּים, ships the Chittaei, for כּתּים מיד צים, [Num
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024.md), whence the expression is
derived כּתּים is Cyprus with its chief city Κίττιον (now Chieti or
Chitti); see under [Gen 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#004.md). Ships
coming from Cyprus are ships which come from the west, from the islands
and coasts of the Mediterranean. In 1 Macc. 1:1 and 8:5 כּתּים is
interpreted of Macedonia, according to which Bertholdt and Dereser think
of the Macedonian fleet with which the Roman embassy sailed to
Alexandria. This much is historically verified, that the Roman embassy,
led by Popillius, appeared with a fleet in Alexandria, and imperiously
commanded Antiochus to desist from his undertaking against Egypt and to
return to his own land (Liv. xlv. 10-12). The lxx have therefore
translated these words by: καὶ ἥξουσι ̔Ρηωμαῖοι καὶ ἐχώσουσιν αὐτὸν καὶ
ἐμβριμήσονται αὐτῷ, and correctly, so far as the prophecy has received
the first historical accomplishment in that factum. ונכאה, he shall lose
courage, is rightly explained by Jerome: non quod interierit, sed quod
omnem arrogantiae perdiderit magnitudinem.

(Note: The historical facts have been briefly and conclusively brought
together by Hitzig thus: "On the complaint of the Alexandrians the Roman
senate sent an embassage, at the head of which was C. Popillius Laenas
(Polyb. xxix. 1; Liv. xliv. 19). After being detained at Delos (Liv.
xliv. 29), they set sail to Egypt after the battle at Pydna (Liv. xlv.
10). Here he met Antiochus four Roman miles from Alexandria, and
presented to him the message of the senate. When Antiochus explained
that he wished to lay the matter before his counsellors, Popillius
described with the staff he carried on his hand a circle round the king,
and commanded him to give his answer before he left this circle.
Antiochus, confounded by the circumstance, submitted and withdrew from
Egypt (Liv. xlv. 12; Polyb. xxix. 11; Appian, Syr. c. 66; Justin. xxxiv.
3).")

וזעם ושׁב, not: he was again enraged, for nothing is said of a previous
זעם. ושׁב, and he turned round (back) from his expedition against Egypt.
Since he was not able to accomplish anything against the נגב (the
south), he turns his indignation against Judah to destroy the covenant
people (cf. [Dan 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028).md). The ושׁב in
[Dan 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md) resumes the ושׁב in [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md), so as further to express how he
gave vent to his anger. Hitzig's interpretation of the first ושׁב of the
return to Palestine, of the second, of the return from Palestine to
Antiochus, is not justified. ויבן, he shall observe, direct his
attention to the Jews who forsook the holy covenant, i.e., the apostate
Jews, that he might by their help execute his plans against the Mosaic
religion - partim ornando illos honoribus, partim illorum studiis ad
patriam religionem obliterandam comparatis obsecundando, as C. B.
Michaelis excellently remarks; cf. 1 Macc. 1:11-16 with 2:18.

[Daniel 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">dan 11:31</span></span>

Here is stated what he accomplished by the help of the apostate Jews.
זרעים, arms, figuratively for help ([Dan
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005).md), are warlike forces, as [Dan
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#015.md), [Dan
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022.md). That the plur. has here the
masculine form, while in those verses it has the fem. form, furnishes no
reason for a difference of meaning, since זרוע in its proper sense of
arm occurs promiscue with both endings in the plur.; cf. for זרעים [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md); [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005.md); [Kg2
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#024.md). מן in ממּנּוּ is not partitive,
a part of him, i.e., the host as a part of the king (Hitzig), but out
from him, or by his command. יעמדוּ, to stand up, not to stand still, as
Hitzig, on the ground of the supposition that Antiochus on his return
from Egypt placed a standing army-corps in Jerusalem, would interpret
it, contrary to the usage of the word, since עמד does not signify to
stand still in the sense of to remain behind, though it means to endure,
to keep the ground ([Dan 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006.md), [Dan
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#015).md). It is disputed whether these
זרעים denote military forces, troops of the hostile king (Hvernick, v.
Leng., Maur., Hitz., Klief.), or his accomplices of the apostate party
of the Jews, and thus essentially identical with בּרית עזבי, [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md) (Calvin, Hengstb. Christol. iii.
1, p. 110, Kran., and others). In favour of the latter view, Kranichfeld
argues that the בּרית עזבי (those that forsake the covenant), according
to [Dan 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md), come under
consideration as a support to the king, and the ממּנּוּ of this verse
before us evidently refers to the king's own army, and therefore would
be superfluous. But these two reasons prove nothing. The ממּנּוּ is not
superfluous, even though it were used of the king's own army. Since in
[Dan 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md), [Dan
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032.md) the king of the north is the
subject of the clause, it was necessary in זרעים to define in what
relation they stood to the king. But the other remark, that the בּרית
עזבי come into view as a support to the king, does not prove that these
are the same who desecrate the sanctuary and set up the abomination of
desolation. On the contrary, if ממּנּוּ denotes the causal exit, the
זרעים cannot be the apostate Jews, but only warlike forces which the
king leads forth. If we refer זרעים to the apostate Jews, then we must,
with Hengstenberg and Gesenius, take ממּנּוּ in the sense of eo jubente.
Moreover, the זרעים manifestly stand in contrast to the בּרית מרשׁיעי of
[Dan 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032.md). By his troops (military
forces) the king lays waste the sanctuary, and he makes by means of
smooth words those who sin against the covenant heathen. Kranichfeld
himself recognises this contrast, and therefore will understand as the
subject to וחלּלוּ not merely "those that forsake the covenant" ([Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030).md), but these along with and
including the warlike power of the hostile king. An expedient which the
difficulty suggested. המקדּשׁ is the temple, and המעוז (the strength) is
in apposition. This apposition, however, does not say that the temple
was fortified (v. Leng., Hitzig, Ewald), but it points out the temple as
the spiritual fortress of Israel. The temple is the "Feste Burg" (firm
tower) of the holy covenant ([Dan
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028).md), as the dwelling-place of
Jehovah, which is a firm fortress to His people; cf. [Psa
31:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004), (3, 4.md); [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md); [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003) (2.md). חלּלוּ is essentially
identical with מקדּשׁו מכון השׁלך, [Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md). The two following clauses state
what the desecration consists in: in the taking away, the removal of the
stated worship of Jehovah, and in the placing, setting up of the
abomination of desolation, i.e., of the idol-altar on Jehovah's altar of
burnt-offering; see under [Dan 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md).
משׁמם is not the genitive, but an adjective to השּׁקּוּץ (without the
article after the definite noun, as e.g., [Dan
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013).md): the desolating abomination,
i.e., the abomination which effects the desolation. With reference to
the fulfilment, cf. 1 Macc. 1:37, 45, 54.

[Daniel 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">dan 11:32</span></span>

The consequences to the people of Israel which result from this sin
against the holy covenant. - The ungodly shall become heathen, i.e.,
shall wholly apostatize from the true God; but, on the other hand, the
pious shall be strengthened in their confidence in the Lord. This is in
general the import of [Dan 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032.md), the
first half of which, however, has been very differently interpreted.
בּרית מרשׁיעי signifies neither "those who sinfully make a covenant"
(Hvernick), nor "sinners among the covenant people" (v. Lengerke), nor
"those who condemn the covenant," i.e., those who reject the sign of the
covenant, circumcision (Hitzig). The latter meaning is altogether
arbitrary. Against the second is the fact that רשׁעים is in use for
sinners; against the first, that בּרית הרשׁיע could only mean: "to
declare the covenant punishable." הרשׁיע means to act wickedly, to sin,
and בּרית can only be the accusative of reference, which is subordinated
to the participle for the purpose of limitation (Ewald, 288); literally,
"the acting wickedly with reference to the covenant." The absence of the
article in בּרית is no proof against he reference of the word to the
holy covenant. The article is wanting in Daniel where otherwise the
determination is found from the connection, e.g., [Dan
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md). Sinning against the covenant is,
it is true, a stronger expression than בּרית עזב (to forsake the
covenant), but it does not include the idea of the entire apostasy from
God, but only insolent violation of the covenant law, so that of בּרית
מרשׁיעי it can very well be predicated יחניף. החניף does not mean to
pollute (Kran.), but to desecrate, to make profane; and spoken of
persons, to make them as heathen, as frequently in the Syriac. חלקּות,
flatteries, here deceitful promises of earthly advantage; cf. under [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md). For the subject spoken of here,
see 1 Macc. 2:18. אלהיו ידעי are the true confessors of the Lord. The
suffix to אלהיו is neither to be interpreted distributively nor to be
referred to עם. To יחזיקוּ we are to supply בּבּרית from the context:
"to hold fast to the covenant." ועשׂוּ, as [Dan
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#017.md), [Dan
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028.md), [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md), to carry out the design. In
what way this is done is explained in [Dan
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md) and [Dan
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#034.md).

[Dan 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md)

משׂכּילי is not the teachers, but intelligentes, those who have insight
or understanding. The pious are meant by the word, those who know their
God ([Dan 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032).md). This is seen from
the contrast רשׁעים, [Dan 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#010.md).
According to the O.T. view, wisdom, insight, are correlative ideas with
the fear of God, piety, [Psa 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md);
[Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md); and לרבּים with the
article, the many, the great multitude of the people who bring
themselves forward to view by the judicious appearance of the pious, are
moved to hold fast by the law of the Lord. Yet they who understand shall
for a time fall by the sword, etc. The subject to נכשׁלוּ is not the
רבּים, or those with the teachers (Hitzig), but the עם משׂכּילי, but not
all, but, according to [Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md), a
number of them; for in [Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md)
falling is not first specially predicated of the teachers, as Hitzig
thinks, but only the effect which that would have on the whole people.
The words point to a warlike rising up of the faithful members of the
covenant people against the hostile king, and have had their first
historical fulfilment in the insurrection of the Maccabees against
Antiochus Epiphanes; cf. 1 Macc. 2ff. In 1 Macc. 1:57; 2:38; 3:41; 5:13,
2 Macc. 6:11, there are examples of this falling by the sword. The רבּים
after ימים in several Codd. is a worthless gloss.

[Dan 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#034.md)

Through the fall of the pious in war little help shall come to the
people of God. מעט (little) is not "spoken contemptuously" (Hitzig), but
the help is so named in comparison with the great deliverance which
shall come to the people of God in the time of the end by the complete
destruction of the oppressor. We may not therefore, with Hitzig and
others, limit this expression to the circumstance that with the
victories of Judas Maccabaeus (1 Macc. 3:11ff., 23ff., 4:14, etc.) they
were far from gaining all, for they also met with a defeat (1 Macc.
5:60f.). For with the overthrow of Antiochus and the liberation of the
Jews from the Syrian yoke, full help was not yet rendered to the people
of God. The "little help" consists in this, that by the rising up and
the wars of those that had understanding among the people the theocracy
was preserved, the destruction of the service of Jehovah and of the
church of God, which was aimed at by the hostile king, was prevented,
and, as the following clauses express, the purifying of the people of
God is brought about. This purifying is the design and the fruit of the
oppression which God brings upon His people by means of the hostile
king. The attaining of this end is a "little help" in comparison with
the complete victory over the arch-enemy of the time of the end. Many
shall connect themselves with the משׂכּילים (intelligentes, [Dan
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033).md) with flatteries (as [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021).md). "The successes of Judas, and
the severity with which he and Mattathias treated the apostates (1 Macc.
2:44; 3:5, 8), had the result of causing many to join them only through
hypocrisy (1 Macc. 7:6; 2 Macc. 14:6), who again forsook them as soon as
opportunity offered; 1 Macc. 6:21ff., 9:23" (Hitzig, Kliefoth).

[Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md)

Such has been the experience in all periods of the church's history.
Therefore does the church need to pass through the purifying process of
affliction, in which not only the lukewarm fall away in the time of
conflict, but also many even מן־המּשׂכּילים. מן is here partitive.
יכּשׁלוּ (they shall fall) is to be understood (cf. [Dan
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033), בח נכשׁלוּ.md) not merely of death
in battle, but of other calamities, such as being imprisoned, plundered,
etc. בּהם לצרוף to melt, i.e., to purify by them, not as to them; for ב
rof ;meht does not represent the accusative, as Kranichfeld thinks,
referring in confirmation to Ewald, 282. The use of ב there spoken of is
of a different nature. The suffix in בּהם refers neither to "those that
understand" alone (Hv.), nor to the "many," [Dan
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033) (v. Leng..md), still less to the
flatterers in [Dan 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#034) (Maurer.md), but
to all of these together, or to the whole company of the people of God
in the sum of their individuals. The verbs וללבּן לברר serve to
strengthen the expression (ללבּן for ללבּין on account of the
assonance). קץ עד־עת (to the time of the end) is connected with
יכּשׁלוּ, the chief idea of the passage. The stumbling and falling of
"those who understand" (the pious) shall continue to the time of the
end, to bring about the purification of the people for their
glorification in the time of the end. For the end stretches itself out
yet to the time appointed (cf. [Dan
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#027).md); i.e., it does not come in with
the "little help" which Israel received by the rising up of "those who
understand" against the hostile king, thus not with the afflictions that
came upon them by Antiochus, but it shall come afterwards at the time
appointed by God. The assertion that "the end is connected with the
death of king Antiochus Epiphanes" (Hitzig, Bleek, and others) is
founded on a misunderstanding of the following section, [Dan
11:36-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md). On the contrary, Kranichfeld
has rightly remarked, that "the statements made in [Dan
11:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md) incl. regarding the king of
the north, now fall, in accordance with the context, into the period
which shall expire at that time of the end are then to be prophesied.

[Daniel 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">dan 11:36</span></span>

The Hostile King Exalting Himself above All Divine and Human Ordinances
at the Time of the End - [Dan 11:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md)

This exaltation of the king is here introduced by the formula כרצנו
ועשׂה, which expresses the self-will and the irresistible might of his
proceeding; cf. [Dan 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#016.md) and [Dan
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#004.md) - "a feature common to Antiochus
and Antichrist" (Klief.). He shall raise himself above every god, not
merely "subjectively in his lofty imagination" (Hitzig), but also by his
actions. כּל־אל, every god, not merely the God of Israel, but also the
gods of the heathen. This does not agree with Antiochus. The ἰσόθεα
φρονεῖν ὑπερηφανῶς which is said of him, 2 Macc. 9:12, is not an
exalting of himself above every god. "Antiochus was not an ἄθεος; he
even wished to render the worship of Zeus universal; and that he once
spoiled the temple does not imply his raising himself above every god"
(Klief.). Of Antiochus much rather, as is said by Livy (41:20), in
duabus tamen magnis honestisque rebus fere regius erat animus, in urbium
donis et deorum cultu. On the contrary, these words before us are
expressly referred to Antichrist, [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md).

Yet further, in his arrogance he shall speak נפּלאות, wonderful, i.e.,
impious and astonishing things, against the God of gods, i.e., the true
God. This clause expounds and strengthens the מלּל רברבן (speaking great
things), which is said of the enemy at the time of the end, [Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md), [Dan
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#011.md), [Dan
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#020.md). In this he will prosper, but
only till the anger of God against His people (זעם as [Dan
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019).md) shall be accomplished. Regarding
כלה see at [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md). This anger of
God is irrevocably determined (נחרצה), that His people may be wholly
purified for the consummation of His kingdom in glory. The perf. נעשׂתה
does not stand for the imperf. because it is decreed, but in its proper
meaning, according to which it represents the matter as finished,
settled. Here it accordingly means: "for that which is irrevocably
decreed is accomplished, is not to be recalled, but must be done."

[Daniel 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">dan 11:37</span></span>

The exalting of himself above all on the part of the king is further
described. "He shall not regard the gods of his fathers," i.e., shall
cast aside the worship of the gods transmitted to him from his fathers.
This again does not accord with Antiochus Epiphanes, regarding whom it
is true that history records that he wished to suppress the worship
practised by the Jews, but it knows nothing

(Note: The statement in 1 Macc. 1:41ff., "Moreover king Antiochus wrote
to his whole kingdom that all should be one people, and every one should
have his laws: so all the heathen agreed according to the commandment of
the king," does not amount to a proof of this. "For," as Grimm rightly
remarks, "the account of such a decree of Antiochus to all (not
Hellenic) peoples of his kingdom is very doubtful. No profane historian
records anything about it, neither does Josephus, nor the author of the
second book of the Maccabees in the parallel passages. It is true that
Antiochus, according to Livy, xli. 20, put great honour upon Jupiter by
building a splendid temple to Tages, and according to Polybius, xxvi.
10, 11, he excelled all kings who preceded him in expensive sacrifices
and gifts in honour of the gods; but this is no proof of a proselytizing
fanaticism." The contrary rather appears from Josephus, Antt. xii. 5. 5,
where the Samaritans, in a letter to Antiochus, declare, contrary to the
opinion entertained regarding them by their governor, that by descent
and custom they were not Jews. Their letter rests on the supposition
that the royal decree was directed only against the Jews. Cf. Falthe,
Gesch. Macedoniens, ii. p. 596. Diodorus also (xxxiv. 1), to whom Hitzig
refers, only states that Antiochus wished to dissolve τὰ νόμιμα of the
Jewish people, and to compel the Jews to abandon their manner of life
(τὰς ἀγωγὰς μεταθέσθαι).

of attempts made by him to destroy the gods and the worship of other
nations. The words which follow, נשׁים על־חמדּת, the old interpreters
understood of the love of women, or of conjugal love; the modern, after
the example of J. D. Michaelis and Gesenius, on the contrary, understand
them of the goddess Anatis or Mylitta, the Assyrian Venus, and refer
them specially to the spoiling of the temple of this goddess in Elymas
(1 Macc. 6:1, cf. 2 Macc. 1:13). Ewald finally would understand by the
expression "the desire of women," the Syrian deity Tammuz-Adonis. The
connection requires us to think on a deity, because these words are
placed between two expressions which refer to the gods. But the
connection is not altogether decisive; rather the כּל על in the clause
at the end of the verse denotes that the subject spoken of is not merely
the king's raising himself above the gods, but also above other objects
of pious veneration. A verbal proof that נשׁים חמדּת denotes the Anatis
or Adonis as the favourite deity of women has not been adduced. For
these words, desiderium mulierum, denote not that which women desire,
but that which women possess which is desirable; cf. under [Sa1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#020.md). But it is impossible that this
can be Anatis or Adonis, but it is a possession or precious treasure of
women. This desirable possession of women is without doubt love; so
that, as C. B. Michaelis has remarked, the expression is not materially
different from נשׁים אהבת, the love of women, [Sa2
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#026.md). The thought: "he shall not
regard the desire of women, or the love of women," agrees perfectly with
the connection. After it has been said in the first clause: he shall set
himself free from all religious reverence transmitted from his fathers,
from all piety toward the gods in which he had been trained, it is then
added in the second clause: not merely so, but generally from all piety
toward men and God, from all the tender affections of the love of men
and of God. The "love of women" is named as an example selected from the
sphere of human piety, as that affection of human love and attachment
for which even the most selfish and most savage of men feel some
sensibility. Along with this he shall set himself free from כּל־אלוהּ,
from all piety or reverence toward God or toward that which is divine
(Klief.). This thought is then established by the last clause: "for he
shall magnify himself above all." To כּל על we may not supply אלוהּ; for
this clause not only presents the reason for the foregoing clause, וגו
כּל־אלוהּ על, but for both of the foregoing clauses. Hitzig and Kliefoth
are right in their interpretation: "above everything, or all, gods and
men," he shall magnify himself, raise himself up in arrogance.

[Daniel 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">dan 11:38</span></span>

On the other hand, he will honour the god of fortresses. That מעזּים is
not, with Theodotion, the Vulgate, Luther, and others, to be regarded as
the proper name of a god, is now generally acknowledge. But as to which
god is to be understood by the "god of fortresses," there is very great
diversity of opinion. Grotius, C. B. Michaelis, Gesenius, and others
think on Mars, the god of war, as the one intended; Hvernick, v.
Lengerke, Maurer, and Ewald regard Jupiter Capitolinus, to whom
Antiochus purposed to erect a temple in Antioch (Livy, xli. 20); others,
Jupiter Olympius; while Hitzig, by changing מעזּים into ים מעז, fortress
of the sea, thinks that Melkart, or the Phoenician Hercules, is referred
to. But according to the following passage, this god was not known to
his fathers. That could not be said either of Mars, or Jupiter, or
Melkart. Add to this, "that if the statement here refers to the
honouring of Hercules, or Mars, or Zeus, or Jupiter, then therewith all
would be denied that was previously said of the king's being destitute
of all religion" (Klief.). The words thus in no respect agree with
Antiochus, and do not permit us to think on any definite heathen deity.
כּנּו על does not signify on his foundation, pedestal (Hv., v. Leng.,
Maurer, Hitzig, Ewald), because the remark that he honoured God on his
pedestal would be quite inappropriate, unless it had been also said that
he had erected a statue to him. כּנּו על has here the same meaning as in
[Dan 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007.md), [Dan
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#020.md), [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md) : "in his place or stead"
(Gesenius, de Wette, Kliefoth, and others). But the suffix is not, with
Klief., to be referred to כּל על: in the place of all that, which he did
not regard, but it refers to כּל־אלוהּ: in the place of every god; which
is not overthrown by the objection that in that case the suffix should
have been plur., because the suffix is connected with the singular אלוה.
The "god of fortresses" is the personification of war, and the thought
is this: he will regard no other god, but only war; the taking of
fortresses he will make his god; and he will worship this god above all
as the means of his gaining the world-power. Of this god, war as the
object of deification, it might be said that his fathers knew nothing,
because no other king had made war his religion, his god to whom he
offered up in sacrifice all, gold, silver, precious stones, jewels.

[Daniel 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">dan 11:39</span></span>

With the help of this god, who was unknown to his fathers, he will so
proceed against the strong fortresses that he rewards with honour,
might, and wealth those who acknowledge him. This is the meaning of the
verse, which has been very differently rendered. The majority of modern
interpreters separate the two parts of the verse from each other, for
they refer the first hemistich to the preceding, and in the second they
find a new thought expressed. Hvernick and v. Lengerke supply a
demonstrative כּה, thus: - thus shall he do to the armed fortresses
together with the strange gods, i.e., fill the fortified temples with
treasures, and promote their worship. But the supplement כּה is here
just as arbitrary as is the interpreting of the armed fortresses of
temples. Hitzig misses the object to עשׂה, and seeks it by changing עם
into עם: he prepares for the armed fortresses a people of a strange god;
but apart from the fact that the change of the text is arbitrary, the
use of the expression "people of a strange god" for colonists is most
singular. Ewald translates the expression thus: "he proceeds with the
strong fortresses as with the strange god," and explains: "he loves the
fortresses only just as a god;" but he has given no proof that ל עשׂה
means to love. The missing object to ועשׂה follows in the second
hemistich, just as in [Deu 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#004.md); [Jos
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#002.md); [Isa
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#011.md). עשׂה means simply to do
anything to one (Kran., Klief.). נכר אלוהּ עם, with the help of the
strange god (עם of assistance, as in [Sa1
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#045).md), not: in the mind of the
strange god (Kliefoth). מעזּים מבצרי, fortified, i.e., strong
fortresses, are not the fortified walls and houses, but the inhabitants
of the fortified cities. With these he does according to his will with
the help of his god, i.e., of war, namely in this, that he rewards with
honour and power only those who acknowledge him. הכּיר אשׁר, who
acknowledges, sc. him, the king who made war his god. Hitzig has
incorrectly interpreted: whom he acknowledges. The Keri יכּיר for the
Kethiv הכּיר is an unnecessary emendation here, as in [Isa
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015.md) with עבּר. The verb הכּיר is
chosen to reflect upon the word נכר. It means to recognise, properly to
acknowledge him as what he is or wishes to be; cf. [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017.md). Such an one he shall increase
with honour, confer upon him sovereignty over many, and divide the land.
בּמחיר is not for payment, for recompense, as the contrast to חנּם
(gratuitously) (Kran.). That is not a suitable rendering here. The word
rather means pro praemio, as a reward (Maur., Klief.), as a reward for
the recognition accorded to him. The Vulgate renders it rightly
according to the sense, gratuito. In this most modern interpreters find
a reference to the circumstance that Antiochus occupied the Jewish
fortresses with heathen garrisons, and rewarded his adherents with
places of honour and with possessions of land (2 Macc. 4:10, 24; 5:15).
But this is what all conquerors do, and it was not peculiar to
Antiochus, so that it could be mentioned as characteristic of him. The
words contain the altogether common thought that the king will bestow
honour, power, and possessions on those who acknowledge him and conduct
themselves according to his will, and they accord with the character of
Antichrist in a yet higher degree than with that of Antiochus.

The last Undertakings of the Hostile King, and His End

By the words קץ בּעת, which introduce these verses, the following events
are placed in the time of the end. Proceeding from the view that the
whole of the second half of this chapter (vv. 21-45) treats of Antiochus
and his undertakings, most modern interpreters find in the verses the
prophecy of a last expedition of this Syrian king against Egypt, and
quote in support of this view the words of Jerome: Et haec Porphyrius ad
Antiochum refert, quod undecimo anno regni sui rursus contra sororis
filium, Ptolem. Philometorem dimicaverit, qui audiens venire Antiochum
congregaverit multa populorum millia, sed Antiochus quasi tempestas
valida in curribus et in equitibus et in classe magna ingressus sit
terras plurimas et transeundo universa vastaverit, veneritque ad Judaeam
et arcem munierit de ruinis murorum civitatis et sic perrexerit in
Aegyptum. But regarding this expedition not only are historians silent,
but the supposition of such a thing stands in irreconcilable
contradiction to the historical facts regarding the last undertakings of
Antiochus. According to 1 Macc. 3:27ff., Antiochus, on receiving tidings
of the successful insurrection of the Maccabees, and of the victory
which Judas had won, since he found that money was wanting to him to
carry on the war, resolved to return to Persia, "there to collect the
tribute of the countries" (1 Macc. 3:31); and after he had made Lysias
governor, he delivered to him the one half of his army, that he might
with it "destroy and root out the strength of Israel," and with the
other half departed from Antioch and crossed the Euphrates into the high
countries, i.e., the high-lying countries on the farther side of the
Euphrates (1 Macc. 3:33-37). There he heard of the great treasures of a
rich city in Persia, and resolved to fall upon this city and to take its
treasures; but as the inhabitants received notice of the king's
intention, he was driven back and compelled to return to Babylon, having
accomplished nothing. On his return he heard in Persia the tidings of
the overthrow of Lysias in a battle with the Maccabees, and of the
re-erection of the altar of Jehovah at Jerusalem; whereupon he was so
overcome with terror and dismay, that he fell sick and died (1 Macc.
6:1-16). The historical truth of this report is confirmed by Polybius,
who mentions (Fragm. xxxi. 11) that Antiochus, being in difficulty for
want of money, sought to spoil the temple of Artemis and Elymas, and in
consequence of the failure of his design he fell ill at Tabae in Persia,
and there died. By these well-established facts the supposition of an
invasion of Egypt by Antiochus in the eleventh, i.e., the last year of
his reign, is excluded. The Romans also, after they had already by their
intervention frustrated his design against Egypt, would certainly have
prevented a new war, least of all would they have permitted an entire
subjugation of Egypt and the south, which we must accept after [Dan
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#042.md), [Dan
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#043.md). Besides, the statement made by
Porphyry shows itself to be destitute of historical validity by this,
that according to it, Antiochus must have made the assault against
Egypt, while on the contrary, according to the prophecy, [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md), the king of the south begins
the war against the king of the north, and the latter, in consequence of
this attack, passes through the lands with a powerful host and subdues
Egypt.

For these reasons, therefore, v. Lengerke, Maurer, and Hitzig have
abandoned the statement of Porphyry as unhistorical, and limited
themselves to the supposition that the section ([Dan
11:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md) is only a comprehensive
repetition of that which has already been said regarding Antiochus
Epiphanes, according to which "the time of the end" ([Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md) denotes not the near time of
the death of Antiochus, but generally the whole period of this king. But
this is, when compared with [Dan
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#027.md), [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md), impossible. If thus, according
to [Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md), the tribulation with
which the people of God shall be visited by the hostile king for their
purification shall last till the time of the end, then the time of the
end to which the prophecies of [Dan
11:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md) fall cannot designate the
whole duration of the conduct of this enemy, but only the end of his
reign and of his persecutions, in which he perishes ([Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md). On the contrary, the reference
to [Dan 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md) avails nothing, because
there also קץ עת has the same meaning as here, i.e., it denotes the
termination of the epoch referred to, and is there only made a more
general expression by means of לעת than here, where by בּעת and the
connection with [Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md) the end is
more sharply defined. To this is to be added, that the contents of [Dan
11:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md) are irreconcilable with the
supposition that in them is repeated in a comprehensive form what has
already been said of Antiochus, for here something new is announced,
something of which nothing has been said before. This even Maurer and
Hitzig have not been able to deny, but have sought to conceal as much as
possible, - Maurer by the remark: res a scriptore iterum ac saepius
pertractatas esse, extremam vero manum operi defuisse; and Hitzig by
various turnings - "as it seems," "but is not more precisely
acknowledged," "the fact is not elsewhere communicated" - which are
obviously mere make-shifts.

Thus [Dan 11:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md) do not apply to
Antiochus Epiphanes, but, with most ancient interpreters, they refer
only to the final enemy of the people of God, the Antichrist. This
reference has been rightly vindicated by Kliefoth. We cannot, however,
agree with him in distinguishing this enemy in [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md) from the king of the south and
of the north, and in understanding this verse as denoting "that at the
time of this hostile king, which shall be the time of the end, the kings
of the south as well as of the north shall attack him, but that he shall
penetrate into their lands and overthrow them." Without taking into
account the connection, this interpretation is not merely possible, but
it is even very natural to refer the suffix in עליו and in עמּו to one
and the same person, namely, to the king who has hitherto been spoken
of, and who continues in [Dan 11:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md)
to be the chief subject. But the connection makes this reference
impossible. It is true, indeed, that the suffix in עמּו refers without
doubt to this king, but the suffix in עליו can be referred only to the
king of the south named immediately before, who pushes at him, because
the king against whom the king of the south pushes, and of whom mention
is made vv. 21-39, is not only distinctly designated as the king of the
north ([Dan 11:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013).md), but also,
according to [Dan 11:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md), he
advances from the north against the Holy Land and against Egypt; thus
also, according to [Dan 11:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md), must
be identical with the king of the north. In [Dan
11:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md) we do not read of a war of
the hostile king against the king of the south and the king of the
north. The words in which Kliefoth finds indications of this kind are
otherwise to be understood.

[Dan 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md)

If we now more closely look into particulars, we find that קץ עת is not
the end of the hostile king, but, as in [Dan
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#027.md), [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md), the end of the present
world-period, in which also, it is true, occurs the end of this king
(קצּו, [Dan 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045).md). For the figurative
expression יתנגּח (shall push), cf. [Dan
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#004.md). In the word there lies the idea
that the king of the south commences the war, makes an aggression
against the hostile king. In the second clause the subject is more
precisely defined by "the king of the north" for the sake of
distinctness, or to avoid ambiguity, from which it thence follows that
the suffix in עליו refers to the king of the south. If the subject were
not named, then "the king of the south" might have been taken for it in
this clause. The words, "with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many
ships," are an oratorical exemplification of the powerful war-host which
the king of the north displayed; for the further statement, "he presses
into the countries, overflows and passes over" (ועבר שׁטף as [Dan
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010).md), does not agree with the idea
of a fleet, but refers to land forces. The plur. בּארצות (into the
countries) does not at all agree with the expedition of a Syrian king
against Egypt, since between Syria and Egypt there lay one land,
Palestine; but it also does not prove that "the south-land and the
north-land, the lands of the kings of the south and of the north, are
meant" (Klief.), but it is to be explained from this, that the north,
from which the angry king comes in his fury against the king of the
south, reached far beyond Syria. The king of the north is thought of as
the ruler of the distant north.

[Dan 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041.md)

Penetrating into the countries and overflowing them with his host, he
comes into the glorious land, i.e., Palestine, the land of the people of
God. See at [Dan 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016.md) and [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md). "And many shall be overthrown."
רבּות is not neuter, but refers to ארצות, [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md). For "that the whole lands are
meant, represented by their inhabitants (cf. The verb masc. יכּשׁלוּ
\[shall be overthrown\]), proceeds from the exceptions of which the
second half of the verse makes mention" (Kran.). The three peoples,
Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites, are represented as altogether spared,
because, as Jerome has remarked, they lay in the interior, out of the
way of the line of march of Antiochus to Egypt (v. Leng., Hitzig, and
others). This opinion Hitzig with justice speaks of as altogether
superficial, since Antiochus would not have omitted to make war against
them, as e.g., his father overcame the Ammonites in war (Polyb. v. 71),
if they had not given indubitable proofs of their submission to him.
Besides, it is a historical fact that the Edomites and Ammonites
supported Antiochus in his operations against the Jews (1 Macc. 5:3-8;
4:61); therefore Maurer remarks, under ימּלטוּ (they shall escape):
eorum enim in oppremendis Judaeis Antiochus usus est auxilio. But since
the king here spoken of is not Antiochus, this historizing
interpretation falls of itself to the ground. There is further with
justice objected against it, that at the time of Antiochus the nation of
Moab no longer existed. After the Exile the Moabites no longer appear as
a nation. They are only named ([Neh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001.md) and [Ezr
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001).md), in a passage cited from the
Pentateuch, along with the Philistines and the Hittites, to characterize
the relations of the present after the relations of the time of Moses.
Edom, Moab, and Ammon, related with Israel by descent, are the old
hereditary and chief enemies of this people, who have become by name
representatives of all the hereditary and chief enemies of the people of
God. These enemies escape the overthrow when the other nations sink
under the power of the Antichrist. עמּון בּני 'ראשׁית, "the firstling of
the sons of Ammon," i.e., that which was most valued or distinguished of
the Ammonites as a first-fruit, by which Kranichfeld understands the
chief city of the Ammonites. More simply others understand by the
expression, "the flower of the people, the very kernel of the nation;"
cf. [Num 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020.md); [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md); [Jer
49:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#035.md). The expression is so far
altogether suitable as in the flower of the people the character of the
nation shows itself, the enmity against the people of God is most
distinctly revealed; but in this enmity lies the reason for this
people's being spared by the enemy of God.

[Dan 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#042.md)

The stretching forth of his hand upon the countries is a sign expressive
of his seizing them, taking possession of them, for which he falls upon
them. בּארצות are not other countries besides those which, according to
[Dan 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040), he overflowed (Klief..md),
but the same. Of these lands Egypt is specially noticed in [Dan
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#042.md) as the most powerful, which had
hitherto successfully withstood the assaults of the king of the north,
but which in the time of the end shall also be overthrown. Egypt, as the
chief power of the south, represents the mightiest kingdoms of the
earth. לפּליטה תּהיה לא (and there shall not be for an escape),
expressive of complete overthrow, cf. [Joe
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#003.md); [Jer
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md).

[Dan 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#043.md)

Along with the countries all their treasures fall into the possession of
the conqueror, and also all the allies of the fallen kingdom shall be
compelled to submit to him. The genitive מצרים belongs not merely to
חמות (precious things), but to all the before-named objects. בּמצעדיו
(at his steps) = בּרגליו, [Jdg 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010.md),
denotes the camp-followers, but not as mercenary soldiers (v. Leng.,
Hitz.). The Lybians and Cushites represent all the allies of the
Egyptians (cf. [Eze 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005.md); [Nah
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#009).md), the most southern nations of the
earth.

The End of the Hostile King

As has been already seen, the expressions in [Dan
11:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md) regarding this king do not
agree with Antiochus Epiphanes, so also the statements regarding his end
are in contradiction to the historical facts regarding the end of the
Syrian king. When the hostile king took possession of Egypt and its
treasures, and made the Lybians and Cushites subject to him, tidings
from the east and the north overwhelm him with terror. The masc. יבהלהוּ
stands ad sensum related to the persons who occasion the reports. The
reports excited his anger, so that he goes forth to destroy many. We
have to think thus on the reports of revolt and insurrections in the
east and the north of his kingdom, which came to his ears in Egypt. On
this ground Hitzig, with other interpreters, refuses to refer the
statement in [Dan 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#044.md) to the
expedition of Antiochus against the Parthians and Armenians (Tacit.
hist. [Dan 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008.md), and App. Syr. c. 45,
46; 1 Macc. 3:37), because Antiochus did not undertake this expedition
from Egypt; and rather, in regard to the east, thinks on the tidings
from Jerusalem of the rebellion of Judea (2 Macc. 5:11ff.; 1 Macc.
1:24), and in regard to the north, on the very problematical expedition
against the Aradiaei, without observing, however, that no Scripture
writer designates Jerusalem as lying in the east of Egypt, But besides,
Antiochus, since he has occupied for some years beyond the Euphrates,
and there met with his death, could not shortly before his end lead an
expedition out of Egypt against Aradus. What Porphyry says

(Note: The words are: Pugnans contra Aegyptios et Lybias, Aethiopiasque
pertransiens, audiet sibi ab aquilone et oriente praelia concitari, unde
et regrediens capit Aradios resistentes et omnem in littore Phoenicis
vastavit provinciam; confestimque pergit ad Artaxiam regem Armeniae, qui
de orientis partibus movebatur.)

(in Jerome under [Dan 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#044).md) regarding
an expedition of Antiochus undertaken from Egypt and Lybia against the
Aradiaei and the Armenian king Artaxias, he has gathered only from this
verse and from notices regarding the wars of Antiochus against the
Aradiaei and king Artaxias (after whose imprisonment, according to App.
Syr. c. 46, he died), without having any historical evidence for it. But
even though the statement of Porphyry were better established, yet it
would not agree with [Dan 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045.md); for
when the king goes forth, in consequence of the report brought to him,
to destroy many, he plants, according to [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045.md), his palace-tent near to the
holy mount, and here comes to his end; thus meeting with his destruction
in the Holy Land not far from Jerusalem, while Antiochus, according to
Polybius and Porphyry, died in the Persian city of Tabae on his return
from Persia to Babylon.

[Dan 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045.md)

נטע of planting a tent, only here instead of the usual word נטה, to
spread out, to set up, probably with reference to the great palace-like
tent of the oriental ruler, whose poles must be struck very deep into
the earth. Cf. The description of the tent of Alexander the Great, which
was erected after the oriental type, in Polyaen. Strateg. iv. 3. 24, and
of the tent of Nadir-Schah in Rosenmller, A. u. N. Morgl. iv. p. 364f.
These tents were surrounded by a multitude of smaller tents for the
guards and servants, a circumstance which explains the use of the plur.
אהלי is incorrectly taken by Theodotion, Porphyry, Jerome, and others
for a nomen propr., meaning in Syria, palace or tower. להר בּין = וּבּין
בּין, [Gen 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006.md); [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017.md), of a space between two other
places or objects. צבי-קדשׁ-צב הר, the holy hill of the delight, i.e.,
of Palestine (cf. [Dan 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009).md), is
without doubt the mountain on which stood the temple of Jerusalem, as v.
Leng., Maur., Hitzig, and Ewald acknowledge. The interpretation of the
mountain of the temple of Anatis in Elymas (Dereser, Hvernick) needs no
refutation. According to this, ימּים cannot designate the Mediterranean
and the Dead Sea, as Kliefoth supposes, but it is only the poetic plur.
of fulness, as a sign of the great Mediterranean Sea. Since now this
scene where the great enemy of the people of God comes to his end, i.e.,
perishes, in no respect agrees with the place where Antiochus died, then
according to Hitzig the pseudo-Daniel does not here accurately
distinguish the separate expeditions from one another, and must have
omitted between the first and the second half of the verse the interval
between the return of Antiochus from Egypt and his death, because
Antiochus never again trod the soil of Palestine. Such expedients
condemn themselves. With "he shall come to his end," cf. [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md), where the end of this enemy of
God is described as a being "broken without the hand of man." Here the
expression "and none shall help him" is added to designate the
hopelessness of his overthrow.

The placing of the overthrow of this enemy with his host near the
temple-mountain agrees with the other prophecies of the O.T., which
place the decisive destruction of the hostile world-power by the
appearance of the Lord for the consummation of His kingdom upon the
mountains of Israel ([Eze 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#004).md), or in
the valley of Jehoshaphat at Jerusalem, or at Jerusalem ([Joe
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md), [Joe
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#012.md).; [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md), and confirms the result of our
exposition, that the hostile king, the last enemy of the world-power, is
the Antichrist. With this also the conclusion, [Dan
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md), is in harmony.
