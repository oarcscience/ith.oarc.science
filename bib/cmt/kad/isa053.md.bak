### [Isaiah Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 53:1</span></span>

But, says the second turn in [Isa
53:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md), the man of sorrows was
despised among us, and the prophecy as to his future was not believed.
We hear the first lamentation (the question is, From whose mouth does it
come?) in [Isa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md) : "Who hath
believed our preaching; and the arm of Jehovah, over whom has it been
revealed?" "I was formerly mistaken," says Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, ii.
1, 159, 160), "as to the connection between [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md) and [Isa
52:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md), and thought that the
Gentiles were the speakers in the former, simply because it was to them
that the latter referred. But I see now that I was in error. It is
affirmed of the heathen, that they have never heard before the things
which they now see with their eyes. Consequently it cannot be they who
exclaim, or in whose name the inquiry is made, Who hath believed our
preaching?" Moreover, it cannot be they, both because the redemption
itself and the exaltation of the Mediator of the redemption are made
known to them from the midst of Israel as already accomplished facts,
and also because according to [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md) (cf., [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md); [Isa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md); [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005).md) they hear the things unheard of
before, with amazement which passes into reverent awe, as the
satisfaction of their own desires, in other words, with the glad
obedience of faith. And we may also add, that the expression in [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md), "for the transgression of my
people," would be quite out of place in the mouths of Gentiles, and
that, as a general rule, words attributed to Gentiles ought to be
expressly introduced as theirs. Whenever we find a "we" introduced
abruptly in the midst of a prophecy, it is always Israel that speaks,
including the prophet himself ([Isa
42:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#024.md); [Isa
64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md); [Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006.md); [Isa
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016), etc..md). Hofmann therefore very
properly rejects the view advocated by many, from Calvin down to Stier
and Oehler, who suppose that it is the prophet himself who is speaking
here in connection with the other heralds of salvation; "for," as he
says, "how does all the rest which is expressed in the 1st pers. plural
tally with such a supposition?" If it is really Israel, which confesses
in [Isa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md). how blind it has been to
the calling of the servant of Jehovah, which was formerly hidden in
humiliation but is now manifested in glory; the mournful inquiry in [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md) must also proceed from the mouth
of Israel. The references to this passage in [Joh
12:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#037.md), and [Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016.md), do not compel us to assign [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md) to the prophet and his comrades
in office. It is Israel that speaks even in [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md). The nation, which acknowledges
with penitence how shamefully it has mistaken its own Saviour, laments
that it has put no faith in the tidings of the lofty and glorious
calling of the servant of God. We need not assume, therefore, that there
is any change of subject in [Isa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md);
and (what is still more decisive) it is necessary that we should not, if
we would keep up any close connection between [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md) and [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md). The heathen receive with faith
tidings of things which had never been heard of before; whereas Israel
has to lament that it put no faith in the tidings which it had heard
long, long before, not only with reference to the person and work of the
servant of God, but with regard to his lowly origin and glorious end.
שמוּעה (a noun after the form ישׁוּעה, שׁבוּעה, a different form from
that of גּדלּה, which is derived from the adjective גדל) signifies the
hearsay (ἀκοή), i.e., the tidings, more especially the prophetic
announcement in [Isa 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009.md); and
שׁמעתנוּ, according to the primary subjective force of the suffix, is
equivalent to שמענוּ אשר שמוּעה (cf., [Jer
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014).md), i.e., the hearsay which we
have heard. There were some, indeed, who did not refuse to believe the
tidings which Israel heard: ἀλλ ̓ οὖ πάντες ὑπήκουσαν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ ([Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016).md); the number of the believers
was vanishingly small, when compared with the unbelieving mass of the
nation. And it is the latter, or rather its remnant which had eventually
come to its senses, that here inquires, Who hath believed our preaching,
i.e., the preaching that was common among us? The substance of the
preaching, which had not been believed, was the exaltation of the
servant of God from a state of deep degradation. This is a work
performed by the "arm of Jehovah," namely, His holy arm that has been
made bare, and that now effects the salvation of His people, and of the
nations generally, according to His own counsel ([Isa
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md); [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005).md). This arm works down from on
high, exalted far above all created things; men have it above them, and
it is made manifest to those who recognise it in what is passing around
them. Who, asks Israel, has had any faith in the coming exaltation of
the servant of God? who has recognised the omnipotence of Jehovah, which
has set itself to effect his exaltation? All that follows is the
confession of the Israel of the last times, to which this question is
the introduction. We must not overlook the fact that this golden
"passional" is also one of the greatest prophecies of the future
conversion of the nation, which has rejected the servant of God, and
allowed the Gentiles to be the first to recognise him. At last, though
very late, it will feel remorse. And when this shall once take place,
then and not till then will this chapter - which, to use an old epithet,
will ever be carnificina Rabbinorum - receive its complete historical
fulfilment.

[Isaiah 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 53:2</span></span>

The confession, which follows, grows out of the great lamentation
depicted by Zechariah in [Zac 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011.md).
"And he sprang up like a layer-shoot before Him, and like a root-sprout
out of dry ground: he had no form, and no beauty; and we looked, and
there was no look, such that we could have found pleasure in him." [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md), as a sequel to [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md), looks back to the past, and
describes how the arm of Jehovah manifested itself in the servant's
course of life from the very beginning, though imperceptibly at first,
and unobserved by those who merely noticed the outside. The suffix of
לפניו cannot refer to the subject of the interrogative sentence, as Hahn
and Hofmann suppose, for the answer to the quis there is nemo; it
relates to Jehovah, by which it is immediately preceded. Before Jehovah,
namely, so that He, whose counsel thus began to be fulfilled, fixed His
eye upon him with watchfulness and protecting care, he grew up כּיּונק,
like the suckling, i.e., (in a horticultural sense) the tender twig
which sucks up its nourishment from the root and stem (not as Hitzig
supposes, according to [Eze 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md),
from the moisture in the soil); for the tender twig upon a tree, or
trunk, or stalk, is called ינקת (for which we have יונק here): vid.,
[Eze 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022.md), the twig of a cedar; [Psa
80:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#012) (11.md), of a vine; [Job
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#016.md), of a liana. It is thought of
here as a layer, as in [Eze 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022.md);
and, indeed, as the second figure shows when taken in connection with
[Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), as having been laid down
after the proud cedar of the Davidic monarchy from which it sprang had
been felled; for elsewhere it is compared to a shoot which springs from
the root left in the ground after the tree has been felled. Both figures
depict the lowly and unattractive character of the small though vigorous
beginning. The expression "out of dry ground," which belongs to both
figures, brings out, in addition, the miserable character of the
external circumstances in the midst of which the birth and growth of the
servant had taken place. The "dry ground" is the existing state of the
enslaved and degraded nation; i.e., he was subject to all the conditions
inseparable from a nation that had been given up to the power of the
world, and was not only enduring all the consequent misery, but was in
utter ignorance as to its cause; in a word, the dry ground is the
corrupt character of the age. In what follows, the majority of the
commentators have departed from the accents, and adopted the rendering,
"he had no form and no beauty, that we should look at Him" (should have
looked at Him), viz., with fixed looks that loved to dwell upon Him.
This rendering was adopted by Symmachus and Vitringa (ἳνα εἴδωμεν αὐτόν;
ut ipsum respiceremus). But Luther, Stier, and others, very properly
adhere to the existing punctuation; since the other would lead us to
expect בּו ונראה instead of ונראהוּ, and the close reciprocal relation
of ולא־מראה ונראהוּ, which resembles a play upon the words, is entirely
expunged. The meaning therefore is, "We saw Him, and there was nothing
in His appearance to make us desire Him, or feel attracted by Him." The
literal rendering of the Hebrew, with its lively method of transferring
you into the precise situation, is ut concupisceremus eum (delectaremur
eo); whereas, in our oriental style, we should rather have written ut
concupivissemus, using the pluperfect instead of the imperfect, or the
tense of the associated past. Even in this sense ונראהוּ is very far
from being unmeaning: He dwelt in Israel, so that they had Him bodily
before their eyes, but in His outward appearance there was nothing to
attract or delight the senses.

[Isaiah 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 53:3</span></span>

On the contrary, the impression produced by His appearance was rather
repulsive, and, to those who measured the great and noble by a merely
worldly standard, contemptible. "He was despised and forsaken by men; a
man of griefs, and well acquainted with disease; and like one from whom
men hide their face: despised, and we esteemed Him not." All these
different features are predicates of the erat that is latent in non
species ei neque decor and non adspectus. Nibhzeh is introduced again
palindromically at the close in Isaiah's peculiar style; consequently
Martini's conjecture לא וגו נבזהוּ is to be rejected. This nibhzeh (cf.,
bâzōh, [Isa 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007).md) is the keynote of
the description which looks back in this plaintive tone. The predicate
chădal 'ı̄shı̄m is misunderstood by nearly all the commentators, inasmuch
as they take אישׁים as synonymous with בני־אדם, whereas it is rather
used in the sense of בני־אישׁ (lords), as distinguished from benē 'âdâm,
or people generally (see [Isa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md),
[Isa 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md), [Isa
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017).md). The only other passages in
which it occurs are [Pro 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#004.md) and [Psa
141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004.md); and in both instances it
signifies persons of rank. Hence Cocceius explains it thus: "wanting in
men, i.e., having no respectable men with Him, to support Him with their
authority." It might also be understood as meaning the ending one among
men, i.e., the one who takes the last place (S. ἐλάχιστος, Jer.
novissimus); but in this case He Himself would be described as אישׁ,
whereas it is absolutely affirmed that He had not the appearance or
distinction of such an one. But the rendering deficiens (wanting) is
quite correct; compare [Job 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#014.md), "my
kinsfolk have failed" (defecerunt, châdelū, cognati mei). The Arabic
chadhalahu or chadhala ‛anhu (also points to the true meaning; and from
this we have the derivatives châdhil, refusing assistance, leaving
without help; and machdhûl, helpless, forsaken (see Lane's Arabic
Lexicon). In Hebrew, châdal has not only the transitive meaning to
discontinue or leave off a thing, but the intransitive, to case or be in
want, so that chădal 'ı̄shı̄m may mean one in want of men of rank, i.e.,
finding no sympathy from such men. The chief men of His nation who
towered above the multitude, the great men of this world, withdrew their
hands from Him, drew back from Him: He had none of the men of any
distinction at His side. Moreover, He was מכאבות אישׁ, a man of sorrow
of heart in all its forms, i.e., a man whose chief distinction was, that
His life was one of constant painful endurance. And He was also חלי
ידוּע, that is to say, not one known through His sickness (according to
[Deu 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#013.md), [Deu
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#015).md), which is hardly sufficient to
express the genitive construction; nor an acquaintance of disease (S.
γνωστὸς νόσῳ, familiaris morbo), which would be expressed by מידּע or
מודע; but scitus morbi, i.e., one who was placed in a state to make the
acquaintance of disease. The deponent passive ירוּע, acquainted (like
bâtuăch, confisus; zâkbūr, mindful; peritus, pervaded, experienced), is
supported by מדּוּע = מה־יּרוּע; Gr. τί μαθών. The meaning is not, that
He had by nature a sickly body, falling out of one disease into another;
but that the wrath instigated by sin, and the zeal of self-sacrifice
([Psa 69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010).md), burnt like the fire of a
fever in His soul and body, so that even if He had not died a violent
death, He would have succumbed to the force of the powers of destruction
that were innate in humanity in consequence of sin, and of His own
self-consuming conflict with them. Moreover, He was kemastēr pânı̄m
mimmennū. This cannot mean, "like one hiding his face from us," as
Hengstenberg supposes (with an allusion to [Lev
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045).md); or, what is comparatively
better, "like one causing the hiding of the face from him:" for although
the feminine of the participle is written מסתּרת, and in the plural
מסתּרים for מסתּירים is quite possible, we never meet with mastēr for
mastı̄r, like hastēr for hastı̄r in the infinitive ([Isa
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015.md), cf., [Deu
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012).md). Hence mastēr must be a noun
(of the form marbēts, marbēq, mashchēth); and the words mean either
"like the hiding of the face on our part," or like one who met with this
from us, or (what is more natural) like the hiding of the face before
his presence (according to [Isa 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md);
[Isa 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md); [Isa
54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008.md); [Isa
59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002), and many other passages.md), i.e.,
like one whose repulsive face it is impossible to endure, so that men
turn away their face or cover it with their dress (compare [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md) with [Job
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010).md). And lastly, all the predicates
are summed up in the expressive word nibhzeh: He was despised, and we
did not think Him dear and worthy, but rather "esteemed Him not," or
rather did not estimate Him at all, or as Luther expresses it,
"estimated Him at nothing" (châshabh, to reckon, value, esteem, as in
[Isa 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017.md); [Isa
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008.md); [Mal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016).md).

The second turn closes here. The preaching concerning His calling and
His future was not believed; but the Man of sorrows was greatly despised
among us.

[Isaiah 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 53:4</span></span>

Those who formerly mistook and despised the Servant of Jehovah on
account of His miserable condition, now confess that His sufferings were
altogether of a different character from what they had supposed. "Verily
He hath borne our diseases and our pains: He hath laden them upon
Himself; but we regarded Him as one stricken, smitten of God, and
afflicted." It might appear doubtful whether אכן (the fuller form of אך)
is affirmative here, as in [Isa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007.md);
[Isa 45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015.md), or adversative, as in [Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004.md). The latter meaning grows out of
the former, inasmuch as it is the opposite which is strongly affirmed.
We have rendered it affirmatively (Jer. vere), not adversatively (verum,
ut vero), because [Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md) itself
consists of two antithetical halves - a relation which is expressed in
the independent pronouns הוּא and אנחנוּ, that answer to one another.
The penitents contrast themselves and their false notion with Him and
His real achievement. In Matthew ([Mat
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017).md) the words are rendered freely
and faithfully thus: αὐτὸς τὰς ἀσθενείας ἡμῶν ἔλαβε καὶ τὰς νόσους
ἐβάστασεν. Even the fact that the relief which Jesus afforded to all
kinds of bodily diseases is regarded as a fulfilment of what is here
affirmed of the Servant of Jehovah, is an exegetical index worth
noticing. In [Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md) it is not
really sin that is spoken of, but the evil which is consequent upon
human sin, although not always the direct consequence of the sins of
individuals ([Joh 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003).md). But in the
fact that He was concerned to relieve this evil in all its forms,
whenever it came in His way in the exercise of His calling, the relief
implied as a consequence in [Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md)
was brought distinctly into view, though not the bearing and lading that
are primarily noticed here. Matthew has very aptly rendered נשׂא by
ἔλαβε, and סבל by ἐβάστασε. For whilst סבל denotes the toilsome bearing
of a burden that has been taken up, נשׂא combines in itself the ideas of
tollere and ferre. When construed with the accusative of the sin, it
signifies to take the debt of sin upon one's self, and carry it as one's
own, i.e., to look at it and feel it as one's own (e.g., [Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md), [Lev
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017).md), or more frequently to bear the
punishment occasioned by sin, i.e., to make expiation for it ([Lev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#016.md); [Lev
20:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#019.md); [Lev
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#015).md), and in any case in which the
person bearing it is not himself the guilty person, to bear sin in a
mediatorial capacity, for the purpose of making expiation for it ([Lev
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017).md). The lxx render this נשׂא both
in the Pentateuch and Ezekiel λαβεῖν ἁμαρτίαν, once ἀναφέρειν; and it is
evident that both of these are to be understood in the sense of an
expiatory bearing, and not merely of taking away, as has been recently
maintained in opposition to the satisfactio vicaria, as we may see
clearly enough from [Eze 4:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#004.md), where
the עון שׂאת is represented by the prophet in a symbolical action.

But in the case before us, where it is not the sins, but "our diseases"
(חלינוּ is a defective plural, as the singular would be written חלינוּ)
and "our pains" that are the object, this mediatorial sense remains
essentially the same. The meaning is not merely that the Servant of God
entered into the fellowship of our sufferings, but that He took upon
Himself the sufferings which we had to bear and deserved to bear, and
therefore not only took them away (as [Mat
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017) might make it appear.md), but bore
them in His own person, that He might deliver us from them. But when one
person takes upon himself suffering which another would have had to
bear, and therefore not only endures it with him, but in his stead, this
is called substitution or representation - an idea which, however
unintelligible to the understanding, belongs to the actual substance of
the common consciousness of man, and the realities of the divine
government of the world as brought within the range of our experience,
and one which has continued even down to the present time to have much
greater vigour in the Jewish nation, where it has found it true
expression in sacrifice and the kindred institutions, than in any other,
at least so far as its nationality has not been entirely annulled.

(Note: See my Jesus and Hillel, pp. 26, 27.)

Here again it is Israel, which, having been at length better instructed,
and now bearing witness against itself, laments its former blindness to
the mediatorially vicarious character of the deep agonies, both of soul
and body, that were endured by the great Sufferer. They looked upon them
as the punishment of His own sins, and indeed - inasmuch as, like the
friends of Job, they measured the sin of the Sufferer by the sufferings
that He endured - of peculiarly great sins. They saw in Him נגוּע, "one
stricken," i.e., afflicted with a hateful, shocking disease ([Gen
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017.md); [Sa1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#009).md) - such, for example, as leprosy,
which was called נגע κατ ̓ ἐξ ([Kg2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005.md), A. ἀφήμενον, S. ἐν ἁφῆ ὄντα =
leprosum, Th. μεμαστιγωμένον, cf., μάστιγες, [Mar
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010), scourges, i.e., bad attacks.md);
also אלהים מכּה, "one smitten of God" (from nâkhâh, root נך, נג; see
Comm. on Job, at [Job 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008).md), and מענּה
bowed down (by God), i.e., afflicted with sufferings. The name Jehovah
would have been out of place here, where the evident intention is to
point to the all-determining divine power generally, whose vengeance
appeared to have fallen upon this particular sufferer. The construction
mukkēh 'Elōhı̄m signifies, like the Arabic muqâtal rabbuh, one who has
been defeated in conflict with God his Lord (see Comm. on Job, at [Job
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028).md); and 'Elōhı̄m has the syntactic
position between the two adjectives, which it necessarily must have in
order to be logically connected with them both.

[Isaiah 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 53:5</span></span>

In [Isa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md), והוּא, as contrasted
with ואנחנוּ, continues the true state of the case as contrasted with
their false judgment. "Whereas He was pierced for our sins, bruised for
our iniquities: the punishment was laid upon Him for our peace; and
through His stripes we were healed." The question is, whether [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md) describes what He was during His
life, or what He was in His death. The words decide in favour of the
latter. For although châlâl is applied to a person mortally wounded but
not yet dead ([Jer 51:52](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#052.md); [Psa
69:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#027).md), and châlal to a heart wounded
to death ([Psa 109:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#022).md); the pure
passives used here, which denote a calamity inflicted by violence from
without, more especially mechōlâl, which is not the participle polal of
chı̄l (made to twist one's self with pain), but the participle poal of
châl (pierced, transfossus, the passive of mechōlēl, [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009).md), and the substantive clauses,
which express a fact that has become complete in all its circumstances,
can hardly be understood in any other way than as denoting, that "the
servant of God" floated before the mind of the speaker in all the
sufferings of death, just as was the case with Zechariah in [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md). There were no stronger
expressions to be found in the language, to denote a violent and painful
death. As min, with the passive, does not answer to the Greek ὑπό, but
to ἀπό, the meaning is not that it was our sins and iniquities that had
pierced Him through like swords, and crushed Him like heavy burdens, but
that He was pierced and crushed on account of our sins and iniquities.
It was not His own sins and iniquities, but ours, which He had taken
upon Himself, that He might make atonement for them in our stead, that
were the cause of His having to suffer so cruel and painful a death.

The ultimate cause is not mentioned; but עליו שׁלומנוּ מוּסר which
follows points to it. His suffering was a mūsâr, which is an indirect
affirmation that it was God who had inflicted it upon Him, for who else
could the yōsēr (meyassēr) be? We have rendered mūsâr "punishment;" and
there was no other word in the language for this idea; for though נקם
and פּקדּה (to which Hofmann refers) have indeed the idea of punishment
associated with them, the former signifies ἐκδίκησις, the latter
ἐπίσκεψις, whereas mūsâr not only denotes παιδεία, as the chastisement
of love ([Pro 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011).md), but also as the
infliction of punishment (= τιμωρία κόλασις, [Pro
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#022.md); [Jer
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#014).md), just as David, when he prayed
that God might not punish him in His anger and hot displeasure ([Psa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002).md), could not find a more suitable
expression for punishment, regarded as the execution of judgment, than
יסּר (הוכיח). The word itself, which follows the form of mūsâd ([Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016).md), signifies primarily being
chastised (from yâsar = vâsar, constringere, coercere), and included
from the very outset the idea of practical chastisement, which then
passed over into that of admonition in words, of warning by example, and
of chastity as a moral quality. In the case before us, in which the
reference is to a sufferer, and to a mūsâr resting upon him, this can
only mean actual chastisement. If the expression had been עליו מוּסרנוּ,
it would merely mean that God had caused Him, who had taken upon Himself
our sins and iniquities and thus made Himself representatively or
vicariously guilty, to endure the chastisement which those sins
deserved. but it is שׁלומנוּ מוּסר. The connection of the words is the
same as that of חיּים תּוכחת in [Pro
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#031.md). As the latter signifies
"reproof leading to life," so the former signifies "the chastisement
which leads to our peace." It is true that the suffix belongs to the one
idea, that that has grown up through this combination of the words, like
berı̄th shelōmı̄, "my peace-covenant" ([Isa
54:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#010).md); but what else could our
"peace-chastisement" be, than the chastisement that brings us peace, or
puts us into a state of salvation? This is the idea involved in Stier's
rendering, "restoring chastisement," and Hofmann's, "the chastisement
wholesome for us." The difference in the exposition simply lies in the
view entertained of the mūsâr, in which neither of these commentators
will allow that there is any idea of a visitation of justice here. But
according to our interpretation, the genitive שׁלומנו, which defines the
mūsâr so far as its object and results are concerned, clearly shows that
this manifestation of the justice of God, this satisfaction procured by
His holiness, had His love for its foundation and end. It was our peace,
or, what is more in accordance with the full idea of the word, our
general well-being, our blessedness, which these sufferings arrived at
and secured (the synonyms of shâlōm are tōbh and yeshū‛âh, [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007).md). In what follows, "and by His
stripes (chăbhūrâh = chabbūrâh, [Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).md) we have been healed," shâlōm is
defined as a condition of salvation brought about by healing.
"Venustissimum ὀξύμωρον," exclaims Vitringa here. He means the same as
Jerome when he says, suo vulnere vulnera nostra curavit. The stripes and
weals that were inflicted upon Him have made us sound and well (the lxx
keeps the collective singular, and renders it very aptly τῷ μώλωπι
αὐτοῦ; cf., [Pe1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).md). We were sick
unto death because of our sins; but He, the sinless one, took upon
Himself a suffering unto death, which was, as it were, the concentration
and essence of the woes that we had deserved; and this voluntary
endurance, this submission to the justice of the Holy One, in accordance
with the counsels of divine love, became the source of our healing.

[Isaiah 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 53:6</span></span>

Thus does the whole body of the restored Israel confess with penitence,
that it has so long mistaken Him whom Jehovah, as is now distinctly
affirmed, had made a curse for their good, when they had gone astray to
their own ruin. "All we like sheep went astray; we had turned every one
to his own way; and Jehovah caused the iniquity of us all to fall on
Him." It is the state of exile, upon which the penitent Israel is here
looking back; but exile as being, in the prophet's view, the final state
of punishment before the final deliverance. Israel in its exile
resembled a scattered flock without a shepherd; it had lost the way of
Jehovah ([Isa 63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017).md), and every one
had turned to his own way, in utter selfishness and estrangement from
God ([Isa 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011).md). But whereas Israel
thus heaped up guilt upon guilt, the Servant of Jehovah was He upon whom
Jehovah Himself caused the punishment of their guilt to fall, that He
might make atonement for it through His own suffering. Many of the more
modern expositors endeavour to set aside the paena vicaria here, by
giving to הפגּיע a meaning which it never has. Thus Stier renders it,
"Jehovah caused the iniquity of all to strike or break upon Him."
Others, again, give a meaning to the statement which is directly at
variance with the words themselves. Thus Hahn renders it: Jehovah took
the guilt of the whole into His service, causing Him to die a violent
death through their crime. Hofmann very properly rejects both
explanations, and holds fast to the fact that בּ הפגּיע, regarded as a
causative of בּ פּגע, signifies "to cause anything to strike or fall
upon a person," which is the rendering adopted by Symmachus: κύριος
καταντήσαι ἐποίησεν εἰς αὐτὸν τὴν ἀνομίαν πάντων ἡμῶν. "Just as the
blood of a murdered man comes upon the murderer, when the bloody deed
committed comes back upon him in the form of blood-guiltiness inflicting
vengeance; so does sin come upon, overtake ([Psa
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013).md), or meet with the sinner. It
went forth from him as his own act; it returns with destructive effect,
as a fact by which he is condemned. But in this case God does not suffer
those who have sinned to be overtaken by the sin they have committed;
but it falls upon His servant, the righteous One." These are Hofmann's
words. But if the sin turns back upon the sinner in the shape of
punishment, why should the sin of all men, which the Servant of God has
taken upon Himself as His own, overtake Him in the form of an evil,
which, even it if be a punishment, is not punishment inflicted upon Him?
For this is just the characteristic of Hofmann's doctrine of the
atonement, that it altogether eliminates from the atoning work the
reconciliation of the purposes of love with the demands of
righteousness. Now it is indeed perfectly true, that the Servant of God
cannot become the object of punishment, either as a servant of God or as
an atoning Saviour; for as servant of God He is the beloved of God, and
as atoning Saviour He undertakes a work which is well pleasing to God,
and ordained in God's eternal counsel. So that the wrath which pours out
upon Him is not meant for Him as the righteous One who voluntarily
offers up Himself but indirectly it relates to Him, so far as He has
vicariously identified Himself with sinners, who are deserving of wrath.
How could He have made expiation for sin, if He had simply subjected
Himself to its cosmical effects, and not directly subjected Himself to
that wrath which is the invariable divine correlative of human sin? And
what other reason could there be for God's not rescuing Him from this
the bitterest cup of death, than the ethical impossibility of
acknowledging the atonement as really made, without having left the
representative of the guilty, who had presented Himself to Him as though
guilty Himself, to taste of the punishment which they had deserved? It
is true that vicarious expiation and paena vicaria are not coincident
ideas. The punishment is but one element in the expiation, and it
derives a peculiar character from the fact that one innocent person
voluntarily submits to it in His own person. It does not stand in a
thoroughly external relation of identity to that deserved by the many
who are guilty; but the latter cannot be set aside without the atoning
individual enduring an intensive equivalent to it, and that in such a
manner, that this endurance is no less a self-cancelling of wrath on the
part of God, than an absorption of wrath on the part of the Mediator;
and in this central point of the atoning work, the voluntarily forgiving
love of God and the voluntarily self-sacrificing love of the Mediator
meet together, like hands stretched out grasp one another from the midst
of a dark cloud. Hermann Schultz also maintains that the suffering,
which was the consequence of sin and therefore punishment to the guilty,
is borne by the Redeemer as suffering, without being punishment. But in
this way the true mystery is wiped out of the heart of the atoning work;
and this explanation is also at variance with the expression "the
chastisement of our peace" in [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md), and the equally distinct
statement in [Isa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md), "He hath laid
on Him the iniquity of us all." It was the sin of all Israel, as the
palindromically repeated kullânū emphatically declares, which pressed
upon Him with such force when His atoning work was about to be decided,
but עון is used to denote not only the transgression itself, but also
the guilt incurred thereby, and the punishment to which it gives rise.
All this great multitude of sins, and mass of guilt, and weight of
punishment, came upon the Servant of Jehovah according to the
appointment of the God of salvation, who is gracious in holiness. The
third turn ends here. It was our sins that He bore, and for our
salvation that God caused Him to suffer on our account.

[Isaiah 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 53:7</span></span>

The fourth turn describes how He suffered and died and was buried. "He
was ill treated; whilst He suffered willingly, and opened not His mouth,
like the sheep that is led to the slaughter-bench, and like a lamb that
is dumb before its shearers, and opened not His mouth." The third pers.
niphal stands first in a passive sense: He has been hard pressed ([Sa1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006).md): He is driven, or hunted ([Sa1
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024).md), treated tyrannically and
unsparingly; in a word, plagued (vexatus; compare the niphal in a
reciprocal sense in [Isa 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005.md), and
according to the reading נגשׂ in [Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md) in a reflective sense, to
torment one's self). Hitzig renders the next clause, "and although
tormented, He opened not His mouth." But although an explanatory
subordinate clause may precede the principal clause which it more fully
explains, not example can be found of such a clause with (a
retrospective) והוּא explaining what follows; for in [Job
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008.md) the circumstantial clause,
"sitting down among the ashes," belongs to the principal fact which
stands before. And so here, where נענה (from which comes the participle
נענה, usually met with in circumstantial clauses) has not a passive, but
a reflective meaning, as in [Exo 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#003.md)
: "He was ill treated, whilst He bowed Himself (= suffered voluntarily),
and opened not His mouth" (the regular leap from the participle to the
finite). The voluntary endurance is then explained by the simile "like a
sheep that is led to the slaughter" (an attributive clause, like [Jer
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019).md); and the submissive quiet
bearing, by the simile "like a lamb that is dumb before its shearers."
The commentators regard נאלמה as a participle; but this would have the
tone upon the last syllable (see [Isa
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021.md), [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md); [Nah
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#011.md); cf., Comm. on Job, at [Job
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#027), note.md). The tone shows it to be
the pausal form for נאלרמה, and so we have rendered it; and, indeed, as
the interchange of the perfect with the future in the attributive clause
must be intentional, not quae obmutescit, but obmutuit. The following
words, פּיו יפתּח ולא, do not form part of the simile, which would
require tiphtach, for nothing but absolute necessity would warrant us in
assuming that it points back beyond רחל to שׂה, as Rashi and others
suppose. The palindromical repetition also favours the unity of the
subject with that of the previous יפתח and the correctness of the
delicate accentuation, with which the rendering in the lxx and [Act
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032.md) coincides. All the references in
the New Testament to the Lamb of God (with which the corresponding
allusions to the passover are interwoven) spring from this passage in
the book of Isaiah.

[Isaiah 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 53:8</span></span>

The description of the closing portion of the life of the Servant of
Jehovah is continued in [Isa 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md). "He
has been taken away from prison and from judgment; and of His generation
who considered: 'He was snatched away out of the land of the living; for
the wickedness of my people punishment fell upon Him'?" The principal
emphasis is not laid upon the fact that He was taken away from
suffering, but that it was out of the midst of suffering that He was
carried off. The idea that is most prominent in luqqâch (with â in half
pause) is not that of being translated (as in the accounts of Enoch and
Elijah), but of being snatched or hurried away (abreptus est, [Isa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005.md); [Eze
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#004), etc..md). The parallel is abscissus
(cf., nikhrath, [Jer 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019).md) a terra
viventium, for which נגזר by itself is supposed to be used in the sense
of carried away (i.e., out of the sphere of the living into that of the
dead, [Lam 3:54](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#054.md); cf., [Eze
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011), "It is all over with us".md). עצר
(from עצר, compescere) is a violent constraint; here, as in [Psa
107:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#039.md), it signifies a persecuting
treatment which restrains by outward force, such as that of prison or
bonds; and mishpât refers to the judicial proceedings, in which He was
put upon His trial, accused and convicted as worthy of death - in other
words, to His unjust judgment. The min might indeed be understood, as in
[Isa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md), not as referring to the
persons who swept Him away (= ὑπὸ), but, as in [Psa
107:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#039.md), as relating to the ground and
cause of the sweeping away. But the local sense, which is the one most
naturally suggested by luqqach (e.g., [Isa
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024).md), is to be preferred: hostile
oppression and judicial persecution were the circumstances out of which
He was carried away by death. With regard to what follows, we must in
any case adhere to the ordinary usage, according to which dōr (= Arab.
daur, dahr, a revolution or period of time) signifies an age, or the men
living in a particular age; also, in an ethical sense, the entire body
of those who are connected together by similarity of disposition (see,
for example, [Psa 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005).md); or again (=
Arab. dâr) a dwelling, as in [Isa
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012.md), and possibly also (of the
grave) in [Psa 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020.md). Such meanings as
length of life (Luther and Grotius), course of life (Vitringa), or fate
(Hitzig), it is impossible to sustain. Hence the Sept. rendering, τὴν
γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται, which Jerome also adopts, can only mean, so
far as the usage of the language is concerned, "who can declare the
number of His generation" (i.e., of those inspire by His spirit,or
filled with His life); but in this connection such a thought would be
premature. Moreover, the generation intended would be called זרעו rather
than דורו, as springing from Him.

Still less can we adopt the meaning "dwelling," as Knobel does, who
explains the passage thus: "who considers how little the grave becomes
Him, which He has received as His dwelling-place." The words do not
admit of this explanation. Hofmann formerly explained the passage as
meaning, "No one takes His dwelling-place into his mind or mouth, so as
even to think of it, or inquire what had become of Him;" but in His
Schriftbeweis he has decided in favour of the meaning, His
contemporaries, or the men of His generation. It is only with this
rendering that we obtain a thought at all suitable to the picture of
suffering given here, or to the words which follow (compare [Jer
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031), O ye men of this generation.md).
ואת־דּורו in that case is not the object to ישׂוחח, the real object to
which is rather the clause introduced by כּי, but an adverbial
accusative, which may serve to give emphatic prominence to the subject,
as we may see from [Isa 57:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#012.md); [Eze
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#021.md); [Neh
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#034) (Ges 117, Anm..md); for את cannot be
a preposition, since inter aequales ejus would not be expressed in
Hebrew by את־דרור, but by בדורו. The pilel sōchēăch with be signifies in
[Psa 143:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#005.md) a thoughtful consideration
or deliberation, in a word, meditationem alicujus rei (compare the kal
with the accusative, [Psa 145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005).md). The
following kı̄ is an explanatory quod: with regard to His contemporaries,
who considered that, etc. The words introduced with kı̄ are spoken, as it
were, out of the heart of His contemporaries, who ought to have
considered, but did not. We may see from עמּי that it is intended to
introduce a direct address; and again, if we leave kı̄ untranslated, like
ὃτι recitativum (see, for example, [Jos
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#024.md); compare di, [Dan
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#025).md), we can understand why the
address, which has been carried on thus far in such general terms,
assumes all at once an individual form. It cannot be denied, indeed,
that we obtain a suitable object for the missing consideration, if we
adopt this rendering: "He was torn away (3rd praet.) out of the land of
the living, through (min denoting the mediating cause) the wicked
conduct of my people (in bringing Him to death), to their own
punishment; i.e., none of the men of His age (like mı̄ in [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001), no one = only a very few.md)
discerned what had befallen them on account of their sin, in ridding
themselves of Him by a violent death." Hofmann and V. F. Oehler both
adopt this explanation, saying, "Can the prophet have had the person of
the Ecce Homo before his eye, without intimating that his people called
down judgment upon themselves, by laying violent hands upon the Servant
of God?" We cannot, however, decide in favour of this explanation; since
the impression produced by this למו נגע עמּי מפּשׁע is, that it is
intended to be taken as a rectification of נגוע חשׁבנהו ואנחנו in [Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md), to which it stands in a
reciprocal relation. This reciprocal relation is brought out more fully,
if we regard the force of the min as still continued (ob plagam quae
illis debebatur, Seb. Schmid, Kleinert, etc.); though not in the sense
of "through the stroke proceeding from them, my people" (Hahn), which
would be opposed to the general usage of נגע; or taking למו נגע as a
relative clause, populi mei quibus plaga debebatur (Hengstenberg,
Hvernick). But the most natural course is to take lâmō as referring to
the Servant of God, more especially as our prophet uses lâmō
pathetically for lō, as [Isa 54:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#015.md)
unquestionably shows (notwithstanding the remonstrance of Stier, who
renders the passage, "He was all plague, or smiting, for them"). נגע
always signifies suffering as a calamity proceeding from Go (e.g., [Exo
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md); [Psa
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011.md), and in every other passage in
which it does not occur in the special sense of leprosy, which also
points back, however, to the generic idea of a plague divinely sent);
hence Jerome renders it, "for the sin of my people have I smitten Him."
The text does not read so; but the smiter is really Jehovah. Men looked
upon His Servant as a נגוע; and so He really was, but not in the sense
of which men regarded Him as such. Yet, even if they had been mistaken
concerning His during His lifetime; now that He no longer dwelt among
the living, they ought to see, as they looked back upon His actions and
His sufferings, that it was not for His own wickedness, but for that of
Israel, viz., to make atonement for it, that such a visitation from God
had fallen upon Him (ל as in [Isa
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016.md) and [Isa
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md), where the sentence is in the
same logical subordination to the previous one as it is here, where
Dachselt gives this interpretation, which is logically quite correct:
propter praevaricationem populi mei plaga ei contingente).

[Isaiah 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 53:9</span></span>

After this description in [Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md) of
the patience with which He suffered, and in [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md) of the manner in which He died,
there follows a retrospective glance at His burial. "And they assigned
Him His grave with sinners, and with a rich man in His martyrdom,
because He had done no wrong, and there was no deceit in His mouth." The
subject to ויּתּן (assigned) is not Jehovah, although this would not be
impossible, since נגע has Jehovah as the latent subject; but it would be
irreconcilable with [Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md), where
Jehovah is introduced as the subject with antithetical prominence. It
would be better to assume that "my people" is the subject; but as this
would make it appear as if the statement introduced in [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008) with kı̄ (for.md) were continued
here, we seem compelled to refer it to dōrō (His generation), which
occurs in the principal clause. No objection could be offered to our
regarding "His own generation" as the subject; but dōrō is somewhat too
far removed for this; and if the prophet had had the contemporaries of
the sufferer in his mind, he would most likely have used a plural verb
(vayyittenū). Some, therefore, supply a personal subject of the most
general kind to yittēn (which occurs even with a neuter subject, like
the German es gibt, Fr. il y a, Eng. "there is;" cf., [Pro
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010)): "they (on.md) gave;" and looking
at the history of the fulfilment, we confess that this is the rendering
we prefer. In fact, without the commentary supplied by the fulfilment,
it would be impossible to understand [Isa
53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md) at all. The earlier translators
did great violence to the text, and yet failed to bring out any
admissible thought. And the explanation which is most generally adopted
now, viz., that עשׁיר is the synonymous parallel to רשׁעי (as even
Luther rendered it, "and died like a rich man," with the marginal gloss,
"a rich man who sets all his heart upon riches, i.e., a wicked man"), is
also untenable; for even granting that ‛âshīr could be proved by
examples to be sometimes used as synonymous with רשׁע, as עני and אביון
are as synonyms of צדּיק, this would be just the passage in which it
would be least possible to sustain any such use of the word; since he
who finds his grave with rich men, whether with the godly or the
ungodly, would thereby have received a decent, and even honourable
burial. This is so thoroughly sustained by experience, as to need no
confirmation from such passages as [Job
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#032.md). Hitzig has very good ground,
therefore, for opposing this "synonymous" explanation; but when he
adopts the rendering lapsator, after the Arabic ‛tūr, this is quite as
much in opposition to Arabic usage (according to which this word merely
signifies a person who falls into error, and makes a mistake in
speaking), as it is to the Hebrew. Ewald changes עשׁיר into עשּׁהיק (a
word which has no existence); and Bttcher alters it into רע עשׂי, which
is comparatively the best suggestion of all. Hofmann connects the two
words בּמותיו עשׁיר, "men who have become rich through the murders that
they have treacherously caused" (though without being able to adduce any
proof that mōth is ever applied to the death which one person inflicts
upon another). At any rate, all these attempts spring from the
indisputable assumption, that to be rich is not in itself a sin which
deserves a dishonourable burial, to say nothing of its receiving one.

If, therefore, רשׁיעם and עשׁיר are not kindred ideas, they must be
antithetical; but it is no easier to establish a purely ethical
antithesis than an ethical coincidence. If, however, we take the word
רשׁעים as suggesting the idea of persons found guilty, or criminals (an
explanation which the juridical context of the passage well sustains;
see at [Isa 50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009).md), we get a contrast
which our own usage of speech also draws between a rich man who is
living in the enjoyment of his own possessions, and a delinquent who has
become impoverished to the utmost, through hatred, condemnation, ruin.
And if we reflect that the Jewish rulers would have given to Jesus the
same dishonourable burial as to the two thieves, but that the Roman
authorities handed over the body to Joseph the Arimathaean, a "rich man"
([Mat 27:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057).md), who placed it in the
sepulchre in his own garden, we see an agreement at once between the
gospel history and the prophetic words, which could only be the work of
the God of both the prophecy and its fulfilment, inasmuch as no
suspicion could possibly arise of there having been any human design of
bringing the former into conformity with the latter. But if it be
objected, that according to the parallel the ‛âshı̄r must be regarded as
dead, quite as much as the reshâ‛ı̄m, we admit the force of this
objection, and should explain it in this way: "They assigned Him His
grave with criminals, and after He had actually died a martyr's death,
with a rich man;" i.e., He was to have lain where the bodies of
criminals lie, but He was really laid in a grave that was intended for
the corpse of a rich man.

(Note: A clairvoyant once said of the Lord: "Died like a criminal;
buried like a prince of the earth" (vid., Psychol. pp. 262, 364).)

The rendering adopted by Vitringa and others, "and He was with a rich
man in his death," is open to this objection, that such a clause, to be
quite free from ambiguity, would require במויתו הוּא ואת־עשׁיר.
Hengstenberg and Stier very properly refer both ויתן and קברו, which
must be repeated in thought, to the second clause as well as the first.
The rendering tumulum ejus must be rejected, since bâmâh never has this
meaning; and בּמתיו, which is the pointing sustained by three Codd.,
would not be mausolea, but a lofty burial-hill, after the fashion of the
Hnengrber (certain "giants' graves," or barrows, in Holstein and
Saxony).

(Note: The usage of the language shows clearly that bâmâh had originally
the meaning of "height" (e.g., [Sa2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#019).md). The primary meaning suggested
by Bttcher, of locus clausus, septus (from בום = מהב, Arab. bhm), cannot
be sustained. We still hold that בם is the expanded בא, and במה an
ascent, steep place, or stair. In the Talmud, bâmâh is equivalent to
βωμός, an altar, and בּימה (Syr. bim) equivalent to the βῆμα of the
orator and judge; βωμός, root βα, like the Hebrew bâmâh, signifies
literally an elevation, and actually occurs in the sense of a sepulchral
hill, which this never has, not even in [Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007)..md)

מותי is a plur. exaggerativus here, as in [Eze
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#010.md) (compare memōthē in [Eze
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#008.md) and [Jer
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004).md); it is applied to a violent
death, the very pain of which makes it like dying again and again. The
first clause states with whom they at first assigned Him His grave; the
second with whom it was assigned Him, after He had really died a painful
death. "Of course," as F. Philippi observes, "this was not a thorough
compensation for the ignominy of having died the death of a criminal;
but the honourable burial, granted to one who had been ignominiously put
to death, showed that there must be something very remarkable about Him.
It was the beginning of the glorification which commenced with His
death." If we have correctly interpreted the second clause, there can be
no doubt in our minds, since we cannot shake the word of God like a
kaleidoscope, and multiply the sensus complex, as Stier does, that לא על
(= לא על־אשׁר) does not mean "notwithstanding that not," as in [Job
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017.md), but "because not," like על־בּלי
in [Gen 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#020.md). The reason why the
Servant of God received such honourable treatment immediately after His
ignominious martyrdom, was to be found in His freedom from sin, in the
fact that He had done no wrong, and there was no deceit in His mouth
(lxx and [Pe1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022.md), where the clause
is correctly rendered οὐδὲ εὑρέθη δόλος ἐν τῶ στόματι αὐτοῦ). His
actions were invariably prompted by pure love, and His speech consisted
of unclouded sincerity and truth.

[Isaiah 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 53:10</span></span>

The last turn in the prophecy, which commences here, carries out [Isa
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md) still further, and opens up the
background of His fate. The gracious counsel of God for our salvation
was accomplished thus. "And it pleased Jehovah to bruise Him, to afflict
Him with disease; if His soul would pay a trespass-offering, He should
see posterity, should live long days, and the purpose of Jehovah should
prosper through His hand." החלי cannot possibly be equivalent to החלי,
as Hitzig supposes. An article appended to a noun never obliterates the
fundamental character of its form (not even in הארץ). Nor does Bttcher's
suggestion, that we should read החלי as an accusative of more precise
definition, commend itself; for what would the article do in that case?
It is the hiphil of חלה, like the Syriac agil from gelo; or rather, as
even in Syriac this אגלי is equivalent to אגליא, of חלא, [Ch2
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012) (cf., תּחלוּאים.md), like החטי in
[Kg2 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006.md) and [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035.md), from חטא. דּכּאו is placed
under דּכא) (= דּכאו with Dag. dirimens) in Gesenius' Lexicon; but this
substantive is a needless fiction. דכאו is an inf. piel: conterere eum
(Jerome), not καθαρίσαι αὐτόν (lxx from דּכא) = זכה). According to [Mic
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013.md) (הכּותך החליתי, I hurt to smite
thee, i.e., I smite thee with a painful blow), החלי דכּאו are apparently
connected, in the sense of "And it pleased Jehovah to bruise Him
painfully." But both logically and syntactically this would require the
opposite construction, viz., דכאו החלי. דּכּאו must therefore be an
infinitive, depending upon חפץ, according to [Job
33:32](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#032.md) (= εὐδόκησε; the lxx
thoughtlessly renders it βούλεται). The infinitive construction is then
changed into the finite; for even החלי is subordinate to חפץ, as in [Hos
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#011.md) (cf., [Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021); Ges. 142, 3.md); "he would, made
ill," being equivalent to "he would make ill," i.e., he would plunge
into distress. There is no necessity to repeat דכאו after החלי, in the
sense of "he caused sore evil therewith," viz., with the דכאו. It was
men who inflicted upon the Servant of God such crushing suffering, such
deep sorrow; but the supreme causa efficiens in the whole was God, who
made the sin of men subservient to His pleasure, His will, and
predetermined counsel. The suffering of His Servant was to be to Him the
way to glory, and this way of His through suffering to glory was to lead
to the establishment of a church of the redeemed, which would spring
from Him; in other words, it would become the commencement of that
fulfilment of the divine plan of salvation which He, the ever-living,
ever-working One, would carry out to completion. We give up the idea
that תּשׂים is to be taken as addressed by Jehovah to "His Servant." The
person acting is the Servant, and it is to Jehovah that the action
refers. But Hofmann's present view, viz., that tâsı̄m is addressed to the
people, is still less admissible. It is the people who are speaking
here; and although the confession of the penitent Israel runs on from
[Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md) (where the confessing
retrospective view of the past becomes prospective and prophetic glance
at the future) in a direct prophetic tone, and [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md) might form the transition to
this; yet, if the people were addressed in this word tâsı̄m, it would be
absolutely necessary that it should be distinctly mentioned in this
connection. And is it really Israel which makes the soul of the Servant
an 'âshâm, and not rather the Servant Himself? No doubt it is true, that
if nothing further were stated here than that "the people made the life
of the Servant of God an 'âshâm, inasmuch as it treated Him just as if
it had a pricking in its conscience so long as it suffered Him to live,"
- which is a natural sequel in Hofmann's case to his false assumption,
that the passion described in [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md) was merely the culminating
point in the sufferings which the Servant was called to endure as a
prophet, whereas the prophet falls into the background here behind the
sacrifice and the priest - we should no doubt have one scriptural
testimony less to support the satisfactio vicaria.

(Note: In the first edition of Hofmann's Schriftbeweis (i. 2, 137), in
which he regarded tâsı̄m as addressed to God, he set aside the orthodox
view with the remark, that God Himself makes good the injury that men
have done to Him by giving up the life of His Servant. In the second
edition (i. 2, 208) he supposes the people to be addressed, and it is
therefore the people who make the Servant's life an 'âshâm. The first
edition contained the following correct definition of 'âshâm: "In
general, it denotes what one person pays to make good an injury done by
him to another." The exposition which follows above will show how we are
forced to adopt the orthodox view, if we adhere to this definition and
regard the Servant Himself as presenting the 'âshâm.)

But if we adopt the following rendering, which is the simplest, and the
one least open to exception: if His soul offered (placed, i.e., should
have placed; cf., [Job 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014.md), si
mortuus fuerit) an 'âshâm - it is evident that 'âshâm has here a
sacrificial meaning, and indeed a very definite one, inasmuch as the
'âshâm (the trespass-offering) was a sacrifice, the character of which
was very sharply defined. It is self-evident, however, that the 'âshâm
paid by the soul of the Servant must consist in the sacrifice of itself,
since He pays it by submitting to a violent death; and a sacrifice
presented by the nephesh (the soul, the life, the very self) must be not
only one which proceeds from itself, but one which consists in itself.
If, then, we would understand the point of view in which the
self-sacrifice of the Servant of God is placed when it is called an
'âshâm, we must notice very clearly the characteristic distinction
between this kind of sacrifice and every other. Many of the ritual
distinctions, however, may be indicated superficially, inasmuch as they
have no bearing upon the present subject, where we have to do with an
antitypical and personal sacrifice, and not with a typical and animal
one. The 'âshâm was a sanctissimum, like that of the sin-offering ([Lev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#010.md), [Lev
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#017.md), and [Lev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#013).md), and according to [Lev
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#007.md) there was "one law" for them both.
This similarity in the treatment was restricted simply to the fact, that
the fat portions of the trespass-offering, as well as of the
sin-offering, were placed upon the altar, and that the remainder, as in
the case of those sin-offerings the blood of which was not taken into
the interior of the holy place, was assigned to the priests and to the
male members of the priestly families (see [Lev
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#022.md); [Lev
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006).md). There were the following points
of contrast, however, between these two kinds of sacrifice: (1.) The
material of the sin-offerings varied considerably, consisting sometimes
of a bullock, sometimes of a pair of doves, and even of meal without oil
or incense; whereas the trespass-offering always consisted of a ram, or
at any rate of a male sheep. (2.) The choice of the victim, and the
course adopted with its blood, was regulated in the case of the
sin-offering according to the condition of the offerer; but in the case
of the trespass-offering they were neither of them affected by this in
the slightest degree. (3.) Sin-offerings were presented by the
congregation, and upon holy days, whereas trespass-offerings were only
presented by individuals, and never upon holy days. (4.) In connection
with the trespass-offering there was none of the smearing of the blood
(nethı̄nâh) or of the sprinkling of the blood (hazzâ'âh) connected with
the sin-offering, and the pouring out of the blood at the foot of the
altar (shephı̄khâh) is never mentioned.The ritual for the blood consisted
purely in the swinging out of the blood (zerı̄qâh), as in the case of the
whole offering and of the peace-offerings. There is only one instance in
which the blood of the trespass-offering is ordered to be smeared, viz.,
upon certain portions of the body of the leper ([Lev
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#014).md), for which the blood of the
sin-offering that was to be applied exclusively to the altar could not
be used. And in general we find that, in the case of the
trespass-offering, instead of the altar-ritual, concerning which the law
is very brief ([Lev 7:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001).md), other acts
that are altogether peculiar to it are brought prominently into the
foreground ([Lev 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014.md).; [Num
5:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#005).md). These are all to be accounted
for from the fact that a trespass-offering was to be presented by the
man who had unintentionally laid hands upon anything holy, e.g., the
tithes or first-fruits, or who had broken any commandment of God "in
ignorance" (if indeed this is to be taken as the meaning of the
expression "and wist it not" in [Lev
5:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017).md); also by the man who had in
any way defrauded his neighbour (which was regarded as unfaithfulness
towards Jehovah), provided he anticipated it by a voluntary confession -
this included the violation of another's conjugal rights in the case of
a bondmaid ([Lev 19:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#020).md); also by a
leper or a Nazarite defiled by contact with a corpse, at the time of
their purification, because their uncleanness involved the neglect and
interruption of the duties of worship which they were bound to observe.
Wherever a material restitution was possible, it was to be made with the
addition of a fifth; and in the one case mentioned in [Lev
19:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#020.md), the trespass-offerings was
admissible even after a judicial punishment had been inflicted. But in
every case the guilty person had to present the animal of the
trespass-offering "according to thy valuation, O priest, in silver
shekels," i.e., according to the priests' taxation, and in holy coin.
Such was the prominence given to the person of the priest in the ritual
of the trespass-offering. In the sin-offering the priest is always the
representative of the offerer; but in the trespass-offering he is
generally the representative of God. The trespass-offering was a
restitution or compensation made to God in the person of the priest, a
payment or penance which made amends for the wrong done, a satisfactio
in a disciplinary sense. And this is implied in the name; for just as
חטּאת denotes first the sin, then the punishment of the sin and the
expiation of the sin, and hence the sacrifice which cancels the sin; so
'âshâm signifies first the guilt or debt, then the compensation or
penance, and hence (cf., [Lev 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015).md)
the sacrifice which discharges the debt or guilt, and sets the man free.

Every species of sacrifice had its own primary idea. The fundamental
idea of the ‛ōlâh (burnt-offering) was oblatio, or the offering of
worship; that of the shelâmı̄m (peace-offerings), conciliatio, or the
knitting of fellowship that of the minchâh (meat-offering), donatio, or
sanctifying consecration; that of the chattâ'th (sin-offering),
expiatio, or atonement; that of the 'âshâm (trespass-offering), mulcta
(satisfactio), or a compensatory payment. The self-sacrifice of the
Servant of Jehovah may be presented under all these points of view. It
is the complete antitype, the truth, the object, and the end of all the
sacrifices. So far as it is the antitype of the "whole offering," the
central point in its antitypical character is to be found in the
offering of His entire personality (προσφορὰ τοῦ σώματος, [Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010).md) to God for a sweet smelling
savour ([Eph 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002).md); so far as it is the
antitype of the sin-offering, in the shedding of His blood ([Heb
9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013).md), the "blood of sprinkling"
([Heb 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024.md); [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md); so far as it is the antitype of
the shelâmı̄m, and especially of the passover, in the sacramental
participation in His one self-sacrifice, which He grants to us in His
courts, thus applying to us His own redeeming work, and confirming our
fellowship of peace with God ([Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md); [Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007).md), since the shelâmı̄m derive their
name from shâlōm, pax, communio; so far as it is the antitype of the
trespass-offering, in the equivalent rendered to the justice of God for
the sacrileges of our sins. The idea of compensatory payment, which
Hofmann extends to the whole sacrifice, understanding by kipper the
covering of the guilt in the sense of a debt (debitum), is peculiar to
the 'âshâm; and at the same time an idea, which Hofmann cannot find in
the sacrifices, is expressed here in the most specific manner, viz.,
that of satisfaction demanded by the justice of God, and of paena
outweighing the guilt contracted (cf., nirtsâh, [Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002).md); in other words, the idea of
satisfactio vicaria in the sense of Anselm is brought out most
distinctly here, where the soul of the Servant of God is said to present
such an atoning sacrifice for the whole, that is to say, where He offers
Himself as such a sacrifice by laying down the life so highly valued by
God ([Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); [Isa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005).md). As the verb most suitable to
the idea of the 'âshâm the writer selects the verb sı̄m, which is
generally used to denote the giving of a pledge ([Job
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003).md), and is therefore the most
suitable word for every kind of satisfactio that represents a direct
solutio. The apodoses to "if His soul shall have paid the penalty
(paenam or mulctam)" are expressed in the future, and therefore state
what would take place when the former should have been done. He should
see posterity (vid., [Gen 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#023.md); [Job
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#016).md), i.e., should become possessed
of a large family of descendants stretching far and wide. The reference
here is to the new "seed of Israel," the people redeemed by Him, the
church of the redeemed out of Israel and all nations, of which He would
lay the foundation. Again, He should live long days, as He says in [Rev
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018.md), "I was dead, and, behold, I am
alive for evermore."

(Note: Knobel observes here: "The statement that a person first offers
himself as a trespass-offering, and then still lives for a long time,
and still continues working, is a very striking one; but it may be
explained on the ground that the offerer is a plurality." But how are we
to explain the striking expression in our creed, "rose again from the
dead?")

Thirdly, the pleasure of Jehovah should prosper "in His hand," i.e.,
through the service of His mediation, or (according to the primary
meaning of tsâlach) should go on advancing incessantly, and pressing on
to the final goal. His self-sacrifice, therefore, merely lays the
foundation for a progressively self-realizing "pleasure of the Lord,"
i.e., (cf., [Isa 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028).md) for the
realization of the purpose of God according to His determinate counsel,
the fuller description of which we had in chapters 42 and 49, where it
was stated that He should be the mediator of a new covenant, and the
restorer of Israel, the light of the Gentiles and salvation of Jehovah
even to the ends of the earth.

[Isaiah 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 53:11</span></span>

This great work of salvation lies as the great object of His calling in
the hand of the deceased and yet eternally living One, and goes on
victoriously through His mediation. He now reaps the fruit of His
self-sacrifice in a continuous priestly course. "Because of the travail
of His soul, He will see, and be refreshed; through His knowledge will
He procure justice, my righteous servant, for the many, and will take
their iniquities upon Himself." The prophecy now leaves the standpoint
of Israel's retrospective acknowledgment of the long rejected Servant of
God, and becomes once more the prophetic organ of God Himself, who
acknowledges the servant as His own. The min of מעמל might be used here
in its primary local signification, "far away from the trouble" (as in
[Job 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009), for example.md); or the
temporal meaning which is derived from the local would be also
admissible, viz., "from the time of the trouble," i.e., immediately
after it (as in [Psa 73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020).md); but the
causal sense is the most natural, viz., on account of, in consequence of
(as in [Exo 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023).md), which not only
separates locally and links together temporarily, but brings into
intimate connection. The meaning therefore is, "In consequence of the
trouble of His soul (i.e., trouble experienced not only in His body, but
into the inmost recesses of His soul), He will see, satisfy Himself."
Hitzig supplies בּטּוב ([Jer 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032).md);
Knobel connects בדעתּו, in opposition to the accents (like A. S. Th.
ἐμπλησθήσεται ἐν τῇ γνώσει αὐτοῦ), thus: "He looks at His prudent work,
and has full satisfaction therewith." But there is nothing to supply,
and no necessity to alter the existing punctuation. The second verb
receives its colouring from the first; the expression "He will see, will
satisfy Himself," being equivalent to "He will enjoy a satisfying or
pleasing sight" (cf., [Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015).md),
which will consist, as [Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md)
clearly shows, in the successful progress of the divine work of
salvation, of which He is the Mediator. בדעתו belongs to יצדּיק as the
medium of setting right (cf., [Pro
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#009).md). This is connected with ḻ in the
sense of "procure justice," like ל רפא ([Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010).md); ל הניח in [Isa
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#003.md); [Isa
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012.md) (cf., [Dan
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md), ל הבין, to procure
intelligence; [Gen 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#007.md), ל החיה, to
prolong life - a usage which leads on to the Aramaean combination of the
dative with the accusative, e.g., [Job
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md), compare [Job
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#002).md). Tsaddı̄q ‛abhdı̄ do not stand to
one another in the relation of a proper name and a noun in apposition,
as Hofmann thinks, nor is this expression to be interpreted according to
דּוד המּלך (Ges. 113); but "a righteous man, my servant," with the
emphatic prominence given to the attribute (cf., [Isa
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#030.md); [Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012.md); [Psa
89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051).md), is equivalent to "my righteous
servant.'

But does בדעתו mean per cognitionem sui, or per cognitionem suam? The
former gives a sense which is both doctrinally satisfying and
practically correct: the Righteous One makes others partakers of
righteousness, through their knowledge of Him, His person, and His work,
and (as the biblical ידע, which has reference not only to the
understanding, but to personal experience also, clearly signifies)
through their entrance into living fellowship with Him. Nearly all the
commentators, who understand by the servant of God the Divine Redeemer,
give the preference to this explanation (e.g., Vitringa, Hengstenberg,
and Stier). But the meaning preferred is not always the correct one. The
subjective rendering of the suffix (cf., [Pro
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017).md) is favoured by [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md), where it is said that "the
priest's lips should keep da‛ath (knowledge);" by [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md), where faithful teachers are
called matsdı̄qē hârabbı̄m (they that turn many to righteousness); and by
[Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md), according to which "the
spirit of knowledge" (rūăch da‛ath) is one of the seven spirits that
descend upon the sprout of Jesse; so that "knowledge" (da‛ath) is
represented as equally the qualification for the priestly, the
prophetic, and the regal calling. It is a very unseemly remark,
therefore, on the part of a modern commentator, when he speaks of the
subjective knowledge of the Servant as "halting weakly behind in the
picture, after His sacrificial death has already been described." We
need only recall to mind the words of the Lord in [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md), which are not only recorded
both by the synoptists and by John, but supported by testimony outside
the Gospels also: "No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither
knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
will reveal Him." Let us remember also, that the Servant of Jehovah,
whose priestly mediatorial work is unfolded before us here in chapter
53, upon the ground of which He rises to more than regal glory ([Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md), compare [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md), is no other than He to whom
His God has given the tongue of the learned, "to know how to speak a
word in season to him that is weary, i.e., to raise up the wary and
heavy laden" ([Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004).md). He knows
God, with whom He stands in loving fellowship; He knows the counsels of
His love and the will of His grace, in the fulfilment of which His own
life ascends, after having gone down into death and come forth from
death; and by virtue of this knowledge, which rests upon His own truest
and most direct experience, He, the righteous One, will help "the many,"
i.e., the great mass (hârabbı̄m as in [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md); [Dan
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md), [Dan
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#039.md); [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md); cf., [Exo
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#002.md), where rabbı̄m is used in the same
sense without the article), hence all His own nation, and beyond that,
all mankind (so far as they were susceptible of salvation = τοῖς
πολλοῖς, [Rom 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019.md), cf., πολλῶν, [Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028).md), to a right state of life and
conduct, and one that should be well-pleasing to God. The primary
reference is to the righteousness of faith, which is the consequence of
justification on the ground of His atoning work, when this is
believingly appropriated; but the expression also includes that
righteousness of life, which springs by an inward necessity out of those
sanctifying powers, that are bound up with the atoning work which we
have made our own (see [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md). The
ancients recognised this connection between the justitia fidei et vitae
better than many of the moderns, who look askance at the Romish justitia
infusa, and therewith boast of advancing knowledge. Because our
righteousness has its roots in the forgiveness of sins, as an absolutely
unmerited gift of grace without works, the prophecy returns once more
from the justifying work of the Servant of God to His sin-expunging work
as the basis of all righteousness: "He shall bear their iniquities."
This yisbōl (He shall bear), which stands along with futures, and
therefore, being also future itself, refers to something to be done
after the completion of the work to which He is called in this life
(with which Hofmann connects it), denotes the continued operation of His
sebhâlâm ([Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004).md), through His own
active mediation. His continued lading of our trespasses upon Himself is
merely the constant presence and presentation of His atonement, which
has been offered once for all. The dead yet living One, because of His
one self-sacrifice, is an eternal Priest, who now lives to distribute
the blessings that He has acquired.

[Isaiah 53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 53:12</span></span>

The last reward of His thus working after this life for the salvation of
sinners, and also of His work in this life upon which the former is
founded, is victorious dominion. "Therefore I give Him a portion among
the great, and with strong ones will He divide spoil; because He has
poured out His soul into death: and He let Himself be reckoned among
transgressors; whilst He bare the sin of many, and made intercession for
the transgressors." The promise takes its stand between humiliation and
exaltation, and rests partly upon the working of the exalted One, and
partly upon the doing and suffering of One who was so ready to sacrifice
Himself. Luther follows the lxx and Vulgate, and adopts the rendering,
"Therefore will I give Him a great multitude for booty;" and Hvernick,
Stier, and others adopt essentially the same rendering, "Therefore will
I apportion to Him the many." But, as [Job
39:17](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#017.md) clearly shows, this clause can
only mean, "Therefore will I give Him a portion in the many." If,
however, chillēq b' means to have a portion in anything, and not to give
the thing itself as a portion, it is evident that hârabbı̄m here are not
the many, but the great; and this is favoured by the parallel clause.
The ideas of greatness and force, both in multitude and might, are bound
up together in rabh and ‛âtsūm (see [Isa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007).md), and the context only can decide
which rendering is to be adopted when these ideas are separated from one
another. What is meant by "giving a portion bârabbı̄m," is clearly seen
from such passages as [Isa 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md); [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md), according to which the great
ones of the earth will be brought to do homage to Him, or at all events
to submit to Him. The second clause is rendered by Luther, "and He shall
have the strong for a prey." This is at any rate better than the
rendering of the lxx and Vulgate, "et fortium dividet spolia." But [Pro
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#019.md) shows that את is a preposition.
Strong ones surround Him, and fight along with Him. The reference here
is to the people of which it is said in [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md), "They people are thorough
devotion in the day of Thy power;" and this people, which goes with Him
to battle, and joins with Him in the conquest of the hostile powers of
the world ([Rev 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#014).md), also
participates in the enjoyment of the spoils of His victory. With this
victorious sway is He rewarded, because He has poured out His soul unto
death, having not only exposed His life to death, but "poured out"
(he‛ĕrâh, to strip or empty, or pour clean out, even to the very last
remnant) His life-blood into death (lammâveth like the Lamed in [Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016).md), and also because He has
suffered Himself to be reckoned with transgressors, i.e., numbered among
them (niph. tolerativum), namely, in the judgment of His countrymen, and
in the unjust judgment (mishpât) by which He was delivered up to death
as a wicked apostate and transgressor of the law. With והוּא there is
attached to נמנה ואת־פּשׁעים (He was numbered with the transgressors),
if not in a subordinate connection (like והוא) in [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md); (compare [Isa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007).md), the following antithesis: He
submitted cheerfully to the death of a sinner, and yet He was no sinner,
but "bare the sin of many (cf., [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028).md), and made intercession for the
transgressors." Many adopt the rendering, "and He takes away the sin of
many, and intervenes on behalf of the transgressors." But in this
connection the preterite נשׂא) can only relate to something antecedent
to the foregoing future, so that יפגּיע denotes a connected past; and
thus have the lxx and Vulg. correctly rendered it. Just as בּ הפגּיע in
[Isa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md) signifies to cause to fall
upon a person, so in [Jer 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011.md) it
signifies to make one approach another (in supplication). Here, however,
as in [Isa 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md), the hiphil is not a
causative, but has the intensive force of the kal, viz., to press
forward with entreaty, hence to intercede (with a Lâmed of the person on
whose behalf it occurs). According to the cons. temporum, the reference
is not to the intercession (ἔντευξις) of the glorified One, but to that
of the suffering One, on behalf of His foes. Every word stands here as
if written beneath the cross on Golgotha. And this is the case with the
clause before us, which was fulfilled (though not exclusively) in the
prayer of the crucified Saviour: "Father, forgive them; for they know
not what they do" ([Luk 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034).md).

"The prophetic view," says Oehler, who agrees with us in the general
opinion that the idea of the Servant of Jehovah has three distinct
stages, "ascends in these discourses step by step, as it were, from the
one broad space covered by the foundation-walls of a cathedral up to the
very summit with its giddy height, on which the cross is planted; and
the nearer it reaches the summit, the more conspicuous do the outlines
of the cross itself become, until at last, when the summit is reached,
it rests in peace, having attained what it desired when it set its foot
upon the first steps of the temple tower." There is something very
striking in this figure. Here, in the very centre of this book of
consolation, we find the idea of the Servant of Jehovah at the very
summit of its ascent. It has reached the goal. The Messianic idea, which
was hidden in the general idea of the nation regarded as "the servant of
Jehovah," has gradually risen up in the most magnificent metamorphosis
from the depths in which it was thus concealed. And this fusion has
generated what was hitherto altogether strange to the figure of the
Messiah, viz., the unio mystica capitis et corporis. Hitherto Israel has
appeared simply as the nation governed by the Messiah, the army which He
conducted into battle, the commonwealth ordered by Him. But now, in the
person of the Servant of Jehovah, we see Israel itself in personal
self-manifestation: the idea of Israel is fully realized, and the true
nature of Israel shines forth in all its brilliancy. Israel is the body,
and He the head, towering above it. Another element, with which we found
the Messianic idea enriched even before [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md), was the munus triplex. As
early as chapters 7-12 the figure of the Messiah stood forth as the
figure of a King; but the Prophet like unto Moses, promised in [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md), was still wanting. But,
according to chapters 42, 49, [Isa
50:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001.md), the servant of Jehovah is
first a prophet, and as the proclaimer of a new law, and the mediator of
a new covenant, really a second Moses; at the close of the work
appointed Him, however, He receives the homage of kings, whilst, as [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md) clearly shows, that
self-sacrifice lies between, on the ground of which He rules above as
Priest after the order of Melchizedek - in other words, a Priest and
also a King. From this point onward there are added to the Messianic
idea the further elements of the status duplex and the satisfactio
vicaria. David was indeed the type of the twofold state of his antitype,
inasmuch as it was through suffering that he reached the throne; but
where have we found, in all the direct Messianic prophecies anterior to
this, the suffering path of the Ecce Homo even to the grave? But the
Servant of Jehovah goes through shame to glory, and through death to
life. He conquers when He falls; He rules after being enslaved; He lives
after He has died; He completes His work after He Himself has been
apparently cut off. His glory streams upon the dark ground of the
deepest humiliation, to set forth which the dark colours were supplied
by the pictures of suffering contained in the Psalms and in the book of
Job. And these sufferings of His are not merely the sufferings of a
confessor or a martyr, like those of the ecclesia pressa, but a
vicarious atoning suffering, a sacrifice for sin. To this the chapter
before us returns again and again, being never tired of repeating it.
"Spiritus Sanctus," says Brentius, "non delectatur inani battologi'a, et
tamen quum in hoc cap. videatur βαττολόγος καὶ ταυτολόγος esse, dubium
non est, quin tractet rem cognitu maxime necessariam." The banner of the
cross is here set up. The curtain of the most holy is lifted higher and
higher. The blood of the typical sacrifice, which has been hitherto
dumb, begins to speak. Faith, which penetrates to the true meaning of
the prophecy, hopes on not only for the Lion of the tribe of Judah, but
also for the Lamb of God, which beareth the sin of the world. And in
prophecy itself we see the after-effect of this gigantic advance.
Zechariah no longer prophesies of the Messiah merely as a king ([Isa
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013).md); He not only rules upon His
throne, but is also a priest upon His throne: sovereignty and priesthood
go hand in hand, being peacefully united in Him. And in [Zac
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#013.md) the same prophet predicts in Him
the good Divine Shepherd, whom His people pierce, though not without
thereby fulfilling the counsel of God, and whom they afterwards long for
with bitter lamentation and weeping. The penitential and believing
confession which would then be made by Israel is prophetically depicted
by Isaiah's pen - "mourning in bitter sorrow the lateness of its love."
