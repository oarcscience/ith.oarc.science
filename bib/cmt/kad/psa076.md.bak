### [Psalms Chapter 76](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 76:0</span></span>

Praise of God after His Judgment Has Gone Forth

No Psalm has a greater right to follow [Psa
75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md) than this, which is inscribed
To the Precentor, with accompaniment of stringed instruments (vid., [Psa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001).md), a Psalm by Asaph, a song.
Similar expressions (God of Jacob, [Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md); [Psa
76:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007.md); saints, wicked of the earth,
[Psa 75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md); [Psa
76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010).md) and the same impress throughout
speak in favour of unity of authorship. In other respects, too, they
form a pair: [Psa 75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md) prepares the
way for the divine deed of judgment as imminent, which [Psa
76:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md) celebrates as having taken
place. For it is hardly possible for there to be a Psalm the contents of
which so exactly coincide with an historical situation of which more is
known from other sources, as the contents of this Psalm confessedly (lxx
πρὸς τὸν Ἀσσύριον) does with the overthrow of the army of Assyria before
Jerusalem and its results. The Psalter contains very similar Psalms
which refer to a similar event in the reign of Jehoshaphat, viz., to the
defeat at that time of the allied neighbouring peoples by a mutual
massacre, which was predicted by the Asaphite Jahaziel (vid., on [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001) and Ps 83.md). Moreover in [Psa
76:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md) the "mountains of prey,"
understood of the mountains of Seir with their mounted robbers, would
point to this incident. But just as in [Psa
75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md) the reference to the
catastrophe of Assyria in the reign of Hezekiah was indicated by the
absence of any mention of the north, so in [Psa
76:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md) both the שׁמּה in [Psa
76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004.md) and the description of the
catastrophe itself make this reference and no other natural. The points
of contact with Isaiah, and in part with Hosea (cf. [Psa
76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004.md) with [Hos
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#020).md) and Nahum, are explicable from
the fact that the lyric went hand in hand with the prophecy of that
period, as Isaiah predicts for the time when Jahve shall discharge His
fury over Assyria, [Isa 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md), "Your
song shall re-echo as in the night, in which the feast is celebrated."

The Psalm is hexastichic, and a model of symmetrical strophe-structure.

[Psalms 76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 76:1</span></span>

In all Israel, and more especially in Judah, is Elohim known (here,
according to [Psa 76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002.md), participle,
whereas in [Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md) it is the finite
verb), inasmuch as He has made Himself known (cf. דּעוּ, [Isa
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013).md). His Name is great in Israel,
inasmuch as He has proved Himself to be a great One and is praised as a
great One. In Judah more especially, for in Jerusalem, and that upon
Zion, the citadel with the primeval gates ([Psa
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007).md), He has His dwelling-place upon
earth within the borders of Israel. שׁלם is the ancient name of
Jerusalem; for the Salem of Melchizedek is one and the same city with
the Jerusalem of Adonizedek, [Jos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md). In this primeval Salem God has
סוּכּו, His tabernacle (= שׂכּו, [Lam
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md), = סכּתו, as in [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005).md), there מעונתו, His
dwelling-place, - a word elsewhere used of the lair of the lion ([Psa
104:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#022.md), [Amo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004).md); cf. on the choice of words, [Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009.md). The future of the result ויהי is
an expression of the fact which is evident from God's being known in
Judah and His Name great in Israel. [Psa
76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004.md) tells what it is by which He has
made Himself known and glorified His Name. שׁמּה, thitherwards, in that
same place (as in fact the accusative, in general, is used both in
answer to the question where? and whither?), is only a fuller form for
שׁם, as in [Isa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018.md); [Isa
65:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#009.md); [Kg2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008.md), and frequently; Arab. ta̱mma
(tu̱mma) and תּמּן (from תּמּה) confirm the accusative value of the ah.
רשׁפי־קשׁת (with Phe raphatum, cf. on the other hand, [Sol
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006).md)

(Note: The pointing is here just as inconsistent as in ילדוּת, and on
the contrary מרדּוּת.))

are the arrows swift as lightning that go forth ([Job
41:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#020).md) from the bow; side by side
with these, two other weapons are also mentioned, and finally everything
that pertains to war is gathered up in the word מלחמה (cf. [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018).md). God has broken in pieces the
weapons of the worldly power directed against Judah, and therewith this
power itself ([Isa 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025).md), and
consequently (in accordance with the prediction [Hos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007.md), and Isa 10, 14, [Isa
17:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md), 29, [Isa
31:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md), 33, 37, and more particularly
[Psa 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008).md) has rescued His people by
direct interposition, without their doing anything in the matter.

[Psalms 76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 76:4</span></span>

The "mountains of prey," for which the lxx has ὀρέων αἰωνίων (טרם?), is
an emblematical appellation for the haughty possessors of power who also
plunder every one that comes near them,

(Note: One verse of a beautiful poem of the Muḥammel which Ibn Dûchı̂,
the phylarch of the Beni Zumeir, an honoured poet of the steppe,
dictated to Consul Wetzstein runs thus: The noble are like a very lofty
hill-side upon which, when thou comest to it, thou findest an evening
meal and protection (Arab. 'l-‛š' w-ḏry).)

or the proud and despoiling worldly powers. Far aloft beyond these
towers the glory of God. He is נאור, illustris, prop. illumined; said of
God: light-encircled, fortified in light, in the sense of [Dan
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#022.md); [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md). He is the אדּיר, to whom the
Lebanon of the hostile army of the nations must succumb ([Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034).md) According to Solinus (ed.
Mommsen, p. 124) the Moors call Atlas Addirim. This succumbing is
described in [Psa 76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006.md). The strong of
heart or stout-hearted, the lion-hearted, have been despoiled, disarmed,
exuti; אשׁתּוללוּ

(Note: With orthophonic Gaja, vid., Baer's Metheg-Setzung, 45.)

is an Aramaizing praet. Hithpo. (like אתחבּר, [Ch2
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#035.md), cf. [Dan
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#016.md); [Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003).md) with a passive signification.
From [Psa 76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006.md) we see that the
beginning of the catastrophe is described, and therefore נמוּ (perhaps
on that account accented on the ult.) is meant inchoatively: they have
fallen into their sleep, viz., the eternal sleep ([Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md), [Jer
51:57](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#057).md), as Nahum says ([Nah
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#018).md): thy shepherds sleep, O king of
Assyria, thy valiant ones rest. In [Psa
76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006.md) we see them lying in the last
throes of death, and making a last effort to spring up again. But they
cannot find their hands, which they have lifted up threateningly against
Jerusalem: these are lamed, motionless, rigid and dead; cf. the phrases
in [Jos 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#020.md); [Sa2
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#027.md), and the Talmudic phrase, "he did
not find his hands and feet in the school-house," i.e., he was entirely
disconcerted and stupefied.

(Note: Dukes, Rabbinische Blumenlese, S. 191.)

This field of corpses is the effect of the omnipotent energy of the word
of the God of Jacob; cf. וגער בּו, [Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013.md). Before His threatening both
war-chariot and horse (ו - ו) are sunk into motionlessness and
unconsciousness - an allusion to Ex. 15, as in [Isa
43:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017.md) : who bringeth out chariot and
horse, army and heroes - together they faint away, they shall never
rise; they have flickered out, like a wick they are extinguished.

[Psalms 76:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 76:7</span></span>

Nahum also ([Psa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006).md) draws the same
inference from the defeat of Sennacherib as the psalmist does in [Psa
76:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#008.md). מאז אפּך (cf. [Rut
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#007.md); [Jer
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#018).md), from the decisive
turning-point onwards, from the אז in [Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md), when Thine anger breaks forth.
God sent forth His judiciary word from heaven into the midst of the din
of war of the hostile world: immediately (cf. on the sequence of the
tenses [Psa 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#006.md), and on [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010).md) it was silenced, the earth was
seized with fear, and its tumult was obliged to cease, when, namely, God
arose on behalf of His disquieted, suffering people, when He spoke as we
read in [Isa 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010.md), and fulfilled the
prayer offered in extreme need in [Isa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 76:10</span></span>

The fact that has just been experienced is substantiated in [Psa
76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md) from a universal truth, which
has therein become outwardly manifest. The rage of men shall praise
Thee, i.e., must ultimately redound to Thy glory, inasmuch as to Thee,
namely ([Psa 76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md) as to syntax like
[Psa 73:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003).md), there always remains a
שׁארית, i.e., a still unexhausted remainder, and that not merely of חמה,
but of חמת, with which Thou canst gird, i.e., arm, Thyself against such
human rage, in order to quench it. שׁארית חמת is the infinite store of
wrath still available to God after human rage has done its utmost. Or
perhaps still better, and more fully answering to the notion of שׁארית:
it is the store of the infinite fulness of wrath which still remains on
the side of God after human rage (חמה) has spent itself, when God
calmly, and laughing ([Psa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004).md),
allows the Titans to do as they please, and which is now being poured
out. In connection with the interpretation: with the remainder of the
fury (of hostile men) wilt Thou gird Thyself, i.e., it serves Thee only
as an ornament (Hupfeld), the alternation of חמה and חמת is left
unexplained, and תּחגּר is alienated from its martial sense ([Isa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md); [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009), Wisd. 5:21 \[20\].md), which is
required by the context. Ewald, like the lxx, reads תּחגּך, ἑορτάσει
σοι, in connection with which, apart from the high-sounding expression,
שׁארית חמת (ἐγκατάλειμμα ἐνθυμίου) must denote the remainder of
malignity that is suddenly converted into its opposite; and one does not
see why what [Psa 76:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#011.md) says
concerning rage is here limited to its remainder. Such an
inexhaustiveness in the divine wrath-power has been shown in what has
just recently been experienced. Thus, then, are those who belong to the
people of God to vow and pay, i.e., (inasmuch as the preponderance falls
upon the second imperative) to pay their vows; and all who are round
about Him, i.e., all the peoples dwelling round about Him and His people
(כּל־סביביו, the subject to what follows, in accordance with which it is
also accented), are to bring offerings ([Psa
68:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#030).md) to God, who is מורא, i.e., the
sum of all that is awe-inspiring. Thus is He called in [Isa
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#013.md); the summons accords with
Isaiah's prediction, according to which, in consequence of Jahve's deed
of judgment upon Assyria, Aethiopia presents himself to Him as an
offering ([Isa 18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001).md), and with the
fulfilment in [Ch2 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023.md). Just so does
v. 13a resemble the language of Isaiah; cf. [Isa
25:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md); [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md); [Isa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005.md) : God treats the snorting of the
princes, i.e., despots, as the vine-dresser does the wild shoots or
branches of the vine-stock: He lops it, He cuts it off, so that it is
altogether ineffectual. It is the figure that is sketched by [Joe
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013.md), then filled in by Isaiah, and
embodied as a vision in [Rev 14:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#017.md),
which is here indicated. God puts an end to the defiant, arrogant
bearing of the tyrants of the earth, and becomes at last the feared of
all the kings of the earth - all kingdoms finally becomes God's and His
Christ's.
