Petition of the Hitherto Favoured People for a Restoration of Favour

The second part of the Book of Isaiah is written for the Israel of the
Exile. It was the incidents of the Exile that first unsealed this great
and indivisible prophecy, which in its compass is without any parallel.
And after it had been unsealed there sprang up out of it those numerous
songs of the Psalm-collection which remind us of their common model,
partly by their allegorizing figurative language, partly by their lofty
prophetic thoughts of consolation. This first Korahitic Jahve-Psalm (in
[Psa 85:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#013.md) coming into contact with
[Psa 84:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md), cf. [Psa
84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012)).md), which more particularly by
its allegorizing figurative language points to [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md), belongs to the number of these
so-called deutero-Isaianic Psalms. The reference of [Psa
85:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md) to the period after the Exile
and to the restoration of the state, says Dursch, is clearly expressed
in the Psalm. On the other hand, Hengstenberg maintains that "the Psalm
does not admit of any historical interpretation," and is sure only of
this one fact, that [Psa 85:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002.md) do not
relate to the deliverance out of the Exile. Even this Psalm, however, is
not a formulary belonging to no express period, but has a special
historical basis; and [Psa 85:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002.md)
certainly sound as though they came from the lips of a people restored
to their fatherland.

[Psalms 85:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 85:1</span></span>

The poet first of all looks back into the past, so rich in tokens of
favour. The six perfects are a remembrance of former events, since
nothing precedes to modify them. Certainly that which has just been
experienced might also be intended; but then, as Hitzig supposes, [Psa
85:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#005.md) would be the petition that
preceded it, and [Psa 85:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#009.md) would go
back to the turning-point of the answering of the request - a retrograde
movement which is less probable than that in shuwbeenuw, [Psa
85:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#005.md), we have a transition to the
petition for a renewal of previously manifested favour. (שׁבית) שבּ
שׁבוּת, here said of a cessation of a national judgment, seems to be
meant literally, not figuratively (vid., [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007).md). רצה, with the accusative, to
have and to show pleasure in any one, as in the likewise Korahitic
lamentation- [Psa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md), cf. [Psa
147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md). In [Psa
85:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#003.md) sin is conceived of as a burden
of the conscience; in [Psa 85:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#003.md) as a
blood-stain. The music strikes up in the middle of the strophe in the
sense of the "blessed" in [Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md).
In [Psa 85:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#004.md) God's עברה (i.e.,
unrestrained wrath) appears as an emanation; He draws it back to Himself
(אסף as in [Joe 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015.md), [Psa
104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029.md); [Sa1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019).md) when He ceases to be angry; in
[Psa 85:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#004.md), on the other hand, the
fierce anger is conceived of as an active manifestation on the part of
God which ceases when He turns round (השׁיב, Hiph. as inwardly
transitive as in [Eze 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#006.md); [Eze
39:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#025.md); cf. the Kal in [Exo
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012).md), i.e., gives the opposite turn
to His manifestation.

[Psalms 85:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 85:4</span></span>

The poet now prays God to manifest anew the loving-kindness He has shown
formerly. In the sense of "restore us again," שׁוּבנוּ does not form any
bond of connection between this and the preceding strophe; but it does
it, according to Ges. 121, 4, it is intended in the sense of (אלינוּ)
שׁוּב לנוּ, turn again to us. The poet prays that God would manifest
Himself anew to His people as He has done in former days. Thus the
transition from the retrospective perfects to the petition is, in the
presence of the existing extremity, adequately brought about. Assuming
the post-exilic origin of the Psalm, we see from this strophe that it
was composed at a period in which the distance between the temporal and
spiritual condition of Israel and the national restoration, promised
together with the termination of the Exile, made itself distinctly felt.
On עמּנוּ (in relation to and bearing towards us) beside כּעסך, cf. [Job
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#017.md), and also on הפר, [Psa
89:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034.md). In the question in [Psa
89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006.md) reminding God of His love and of
His promise, משׁך has the signification of constant endless continuing
or pursuing, as in [Psa 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011.md). The
expression in [Psa 85:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#007.md) is like [Psa
71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020.md), cf. [Psa
80:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#019.md); שׁוּב is here the
representative of rursus, Ges. 142. ישׁעך from ישׁע, like קצפּך in [Psa
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002.md), has ĕ (cf. the inflexion of פּרי
and חק) instead of the ı̆ in אלהי ישׁענוּ. Here at the close of the
strophe the prayer turns back inferentially to this attribute of God.

[Psalms 85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 85:8</span></span>

The prayer is followed by attention to the divine answer, and by the
answer itself. The poet stirs himself up to give ear to the words of
God, like Habakkuk, [Hab 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md). Beside
אשׁמעה we find the reading אשׁמעה, vid., on [Psa
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013.md). The construction of האל ה is
appositional, like המּלך דּוד, Ges. 113. כּי neither introduces the
divine answer in express words, nor states the ground on which he
hearkens, but rather supports the fact that God speaks from that which
He has to speak. Peace is the substance of that which He speaks to His
people, and that (the particularizing Waw) to His saints; but with the
addition of an admonition. אל is dehortative. It is not to be assumed in
connection with this ethical notion that the ah of לכסלה is the locative
ah as in לשׁאולה, [Psa 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md). כּסלה is
related to כּסל like foolery to folly. The present misfortune, as is
indicated here, is the merited consequence of foolish behaviour (playing
the fool). In [Psa 85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010.md). the poet
unfolds the promise of peace which he has heard, just as he has heard
it. What is meant by ישׁעו is particularized first by the infinitive,
and then in perfects of actual fact. The possessions that make a people
truly happy and prosperous are mentioned under a charming allegory
exactly after Isaiah's manner, [Isa
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#016.md)., [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008.md); [Isa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md). The glory that has been far
removed again takes up its abode in the land. Mercy or loving-kindness
walks along the streets of Jerusalem, and there meets fidelity, like one
guardian angel meeting the other. Righteousness and peace or prosperity,
these two inseparable brothers, kiss each other there, and fall lovingly
into each other's arms.

(Note: Concerning St. Bernard's beautiful parable of the reconciliation
of the inviolability of divine threatening and of justice with mercy and
peace in the work of redemption, which has grown out of this passage of
the Psalms, Misericordia et veritas obviaverunt sibi, justitia et pax
osculatae sunt, and has been transferred to the painting, poetry, and
drama of the middle ages, vid., Piper's Evangelischer Kalender, 1859, S.
24-34, and the beautiful miniature representing the ἀσπασμός of
δικαιοσύνη and εἰρήνη of a Greek Psalter, 1867, S. 63.)

[Psalms 85:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 85:11</span></span>

The poet pursues this charming picture of the future further. After
God's אמת, i.e., faithfulness to the promises, has descended like dew,
אמת, i.e., faithfulness to the covenant, springs up out of the land, the
fruit of that fertilizing influence. And צדקה, gracious justice, looks
down from heaven, smiling favour and dispensing blessing. גּם in [Psa
85:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#013.md) places these two prospects in
reciprocal relation to one another (cf. [Psa
84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007).md); it is found once instead of
twice. Jahve gives הטּוב, everything that is only and always good and
that imparts true happiness, and the land, corresponding to it, yields
יבוּלהּ, the increase which might be expected from a land so richly
blessed (cf. [Psa 67:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#007.md) and the promise
in [Lev 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004).md). Jahve Himself is
present in the land: righteousness walks before Him majestically as His
herald, and righteousness ישׂם לדרך פּעמיו, sets (viz., its footsteps)
upon the way of His footsteps, that is to say, follows Him inseparably.
פּעמיו stands once instead of twice; the construct is to a certain
extent attractional, as in [Psa 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012.md);
[Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md). Since the expression is
neither דּרך ([Psa 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md); [Isa
51:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#010).md) nor לדּרך ([Isa
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#011).md), it is natural to interpret the
expression thus, and it gives moreover (cf. [Isa
58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008.md); [Isa
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012).md) an excellent sense. But if,
which we prefer, שׂים is taken in the sense of שׂים לב (as e.g., in [Job
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020).md) with the following ל, to give
special heed to anything ([Deu 32:46](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#046.md);
[Eze 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#004.md); [Eze
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#005).md), to be anxiously concerned about
it ([Sa1 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#020).md), then we avoid the
supplying in thought of a second פעמיו, which is always objectionable,
and the thought obtained by the other interpretation is brought clearly
before the mind: righteousness goes before Jahve, who dwells and walks
abroad in Israel, and gives heed to the way of His steps, that is to
say, follows carefully in His footsteps.
