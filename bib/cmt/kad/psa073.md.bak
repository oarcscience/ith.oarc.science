Temptation to Apostasy Overcome

After the one Asaph Psalm of the Second Book, Ps 50, follow eleven more
of them from Psalms 73-83. They are all Elohimic, whereas the Korah
Psalms divide into an Elohimic and a Jehovic group. [Psa
84:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md) forms the transition from the
one to the other. The Elohim-Psalms extend from Psalms 42-84, and are
fenced in on both sides by Jahve-Psalms.

In contents Psalms 73 is the counterpart of pendant of Ps 50. As in that
Psalm the semblance of a sanctity based upon works is traced back to its
nothingness, so here the seeming good fortune of the ungodly, by which
the poet felt himself tempted to fall away, not into heathenism
(Hitzig), but into that free-thinking which in the heathen world does
not less cast off the deisidaimoni'a than it does the belief in Jahve
within the pale of Israel. Nowhere does there come to light in the
national history any back ground that should contradict the לאסף, and
the doubts respecting the moral order of the world are set at rest in
exactly the same way as in Ps 37; Ps 49, and in the Book of Job.
Theodicy, or the vindication of God's ways, does not as yet rise from
the indication of the retribution in this present time which the ungodly
do not escape, to a future solution of all the contradictions of this
present world; and the transcendent glory which infinitely outweighs the
suffering of this present time, still remains outside the range of
vision. The stedfast faith which, gladly renouncing everything, holds
fast to God, and the pure love to which this possession is more than
heaven and earth, is all the more worthy of admiration in connection
with such defective knowledge.

The strophe schema of the Psalm is predominantly octastichic: 4. 8. 8.
8; 8. 8. 5. Its two halves are [Psa
73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md), [Psa
73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md).

[Psalms 73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 73:1</span></span>

אך, belonging to the favourite words of the faith that bids defiance to
assault, signifies originally "thus = not otherwise," and therefore
combines an affirmative and restrictive, or, according to circumstances,
even an adversative signification (vid., on [Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006).md). It may therefore be rendered:
yea good, assuredly good, or: only good, nothing but good; both
renderings are an assertion of a sure, infallible relation of things.
God appears to be angry with the godly, but in reality He is kindly
disposed towards them, though He send affliction after affliction upon
them ([Lam 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#025).md). The words ישראל
אלהים are not to be taken together, after [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016) (τὸν Ἰσραήλ τοῦ Θεοῦ.md); not, "only
good is it with the Israel of Elohim," but "only good to Israel is
Elohim," is the right apprehension of the truth or reality that is
opposed to what seems to be the case. The Israel which in every
relationship has a good and loving God is limited in [Psa
73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md) to the pure in heart ([Psa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004.md); [Mat
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008).md). Israel in truth are not all
those who are descended from Jacob, but those who have put away all
impurity of disposition and all uncleanness of sin out of their heart,
i.e., out of their innermost life, and by a constant striving after
sanctification ([Psa 73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013).md) maintain
themselves in such purity. In relation to this, which is the real church
of God, God is pure love, nothing but love. This it is that has been
confirmed to the poet as he passed through the conflict of temptation,
but it was through conflict, for he almost fell by reason of the
semblance of the opposite. The Chethξb נטוּי רגלי (cf. [Num
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004).md) or נטוּי (cf. [Sa2
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032).md) is erroneous. The narration of
that which is past cannot begin with a participial clause like this, and
כּמעט, in such a sense (non multum abfuit quin, like כּאין, nihil abfuit
quin), always has the perfect after it, e.g., [Psa
94:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017.md); [Psa
119:87](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#087.md). It is therefore to be read
נטיוּ (according to the fuller form for נטוּ, which is used not merely
with great distinctives, as in [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md); [Psa
122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006.md); [Num
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#006.md), but also with conjunctives out
of pause, e.g., [Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md), cf. [Psa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md), [Deu
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037.md); [Job
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006).md): my feet had almost inclined
towards, had almost slipped backwards and towards the side. On the other
hand the Chethb שׁפּכה is unassailable; the feminine singular is
frequently found as predicate both of a plural subject that has preceded
([Psa 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035.md), cf. [Deu
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#007.md); [Job
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016).md) and also more especially of one
that is placed after it, e.g., [Psa
37:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#031.md); [Job
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019.md). The footsteps are said to be
poured out when one "flies out or slips" and falls to the ground.

[Psalms 73:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 73:3</span></span>

Now follows the occasion of the conflict of temptation: the good fortune
of those who are estranged from God. In accordance with the gloominess
of the theme, the style is also gloomy, and piles up the full-toned
suffixes amo and emo (vid., [Psa
78:66](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#066.md); [Psa
80:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#007.md); [Psa
83:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012.md), [Psa
83:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#014).md); both are after the example set
by David. קנּא with Beth of the object ion which the zeal or warmth of
feeling is kindled ([Psa 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md); [Pro
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031).md) here refers to the warmth of
envious ill-feeling. Concerning הולל vid., [Psa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006.md). [Psa
73:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003.md) tells under what circumsntaces
the envy was excited; cf. so far as the syntax is concerned, [Psa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md); [Psa
76:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#011.md). In [Psa
73:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004.md) חרצצבּות (from חרצב = חצּב from
חצב, cognate עצב, whence עצב, pain, Arabic ‛aṣâbe, a snare, cf. חבל,
ὠδίς, and חבל σχοινίον), in the same sense as the Latin tormenta (from
torquere), is intended of pains that produce convulsive contractions.
But in order to give the meaning "they have no pangs (to suffer) till
their death," להם (למו) could not be omitted (that is, assuming also
that ל, which is sometimes used for עד, vid., [Psa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014.md), could in such an exclusive
sense signify the terminus ad quem). Also "there are no pangs for their
death, i.e., that bring death to them," ought to be expressed by להם
למּות. The clause as it stands affirms that their dying has no pangs,
i.e., it is a painless death; but not merely does this assertion not
harmonize with [Psa 73:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018.md)., but it is
also introduced too early here, since the poet cannot surely begin the
description of the good fortune of the ungodly with the painlessness of
their death, and then for the first time come to speak of their healthy
condition. We may therefore read, with Ewald, Hitzig, Bttcher, and
Olshausen:

כי אין חרצבות למו

תּם ובריא אולם

i.e., they have (suffer) no pangs, vigorous (תּם like תּם, [Job
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#023.md), תמים, [Pro
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#012).md) and well-nourished is their
belly; by which means the difficult למותם is got rid of, and the gloomy
picture is enriched by another form ending with mo. אוּל, here in a
derisive sense, signifies the body, like the Arabic allun, âlun (from
âl, coaluit, cohaesit, to condense inwardly, to gain consistency).

(Note: Hitzig calls to mind οὖλος, "corporeal;" but this word is Ionic
and equivalent to ὅλος, solidus, the ground-word of which is the
Sanscrit sarvas, whole, complete.)

The observation of [Psa 73:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004.md) is
pursued further in [Psa 73:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#005.md) : whilst
one would have thought that the godly formed an exception to the common
wretchedness of mankind, it is just the wicked who are exempt from all
trouble and calamity. It is also here to be written אינמו, as in [Psa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014.md), not אינימו. Therefore is
haughtiness their neck-chain, and brutishness their mantle. ענק is a
denominative from ענק = αὐχήν: to hang round the neck; the neck is the
seat of pride (αὐχεῖν): haughtiness hangs around their neck (like ענק, a
neck-ornament). Accordingly in [Psa
73:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#006.md) המס is the subject, although the
interpunction construes it differently, viz., "they wrap round as a
garment the injustice belonging to them," in order, that is, to avoid
the construction of יעטף (vid., Ps 65:14) with למו; but active verbs can
take a dative of the object (e.g., אהב ל ,, רפא ל) in the sense: to be
or to grant to any one that which the primary notion of the verb
asserts. It may therefore be rendered: they put on the garment of
violence (שׁית חמס like בּגדי נקם, [Isa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017).md), or even by avoiding every
enallage numeri: violence covers them as a garment; so that שׁית is an
apposition which is put forth in advance.

[Psalms 73:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 73:7</span></span>

The reading עונמו, ἡ ἀδικία αὐτῶν (lxx (cf. in [Zac
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#006.md) the עינם, which is rendered by the
lxx in exactly the same way), in favour of which Hitzig, Bצttcher, and
Olshausen decide, "their iniquity presses forth out of a fat heart, out
of a fat inward part," is favoured by [Psa
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md), where חלב obtains just this
signification by combination with סגר, which it would obtain here as
being the place whence sin issues; cf. ἐξέρχεσθαι ἐκ τῆς καρδίας, [Mat
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#018.md).; and the parallelism decides
its superiority. Nevertheless the traditional reading also gives a
suitable sense; not (since the fat tends to make the eyes appear to be
deeper in) "their eyes come forward prae adipe," but, "they stare forth
ex adipe, out of the fat of their bloated visage," מחלב being equivalent
to מחלב פּניהם, [Job 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#027.md). This is a
feature of the character faithfully drawn after nature. Further, just as
in general τὸ περίσσευμα τῆς καρδίας wells over in the gestures and
language ([Mat 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034).md), so is it also
with their "views or images of the heart" (from שׂכה, like שׂכוי, the
cock with its gift of divination as speculator): the illusions of their
unbounded self-confidence come forth outwardly, they overflow after the
manner of a river,

(Note: On the other hand, Redslob (Deutsch. Morgenlהnd. Zeitschr. 1860,
S. 675) interprets it thus: they run over the fencings of the heart,
from שׂכה in the signification to put or stick through, to stick into
(infigere), by comparing קירות לבּי, [Jer
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md), and ἕρκος ὀδόντων. He regards
משׂכית sdrag and mosaic as one word, just as the Italian ricamare (to
stitch) and רקם is one word. Certainly the root זך, Arab. zk, ḏk, has
the primary notion of piercing (cf. זכר), and also the notion of purity,
which it obtains, proceeds from the idea of the brilliance which pierces
into the eye; but the primary notion of שׂכה is that of cutting through
(whence שׂכּין, like מחלף, a knife, from חלף, [Jdg
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#026))..md)

viz., as [Psa 73:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#008.md) says, in words that
are proud beyond measure ([Jer 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028).md).
Luther: "they destroy everything" (synon. they make it as or into
rottenness, from מקק). But חמיק is here equivalent to the Aramaic מיּק
(μωκᾶσθαι): they mock and openly speak ברע (with ā in connection with
Munach transformed from Dech), with evil disposition (cf. [Exo
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012).md), oppression; i.e., they openly
express their resolve which aims at oppression. Their fellow-man is the
sport of their caprice; they speak or dictate ממּרום, down from an
eminence, upon which they imagine themselves to be raised high above
others. Even in the heavens above do they set (שׁתּוּ as in [Psa
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015.md) instead of שׁתוּ, - there, in
accordance with tradition, Milel; here at the commencement of the verse
Milra) their mouth; even these do not remain untouched by their
scandalous language (cf. [Jde 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016).md);
the Most High and Holy One, too, is blasphemed by them, and their tongue
runs officiously and imperiously through the earth below, everywhere
disparaging that which exists and giving new laws. תּהלך, as in [Exo
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#023.md), a Kal sounding much like
Hithpa., in the signification grassari. In [Psa
73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010.md) the Chethb ישׁיב (therefore he,
this class of man, turns a people subject to him hither, i.e., to
himself) is to be rejected, because הלם is not appropriate to it. עמּו
is the subject, and the suffix refers not to God (Stier), whose name has
not been previously mentioned, but to the kind of men hitherto
described: what is meant is the people which, in order that it may turn
itself hither (שׁוּב, not: to turn back, but to turn one's self towards,
as e.g., in [Jer 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019).md)

(Note: In general שׁוּב does not necessarily signify to turn back, but,
like the Arabic ‛âda, Persic gashten, to enter into a new (active or
passive) state.))

becomes his, i.e., this class's people (cf. for this sense of the suffix
as describing the issue or event, [Psa
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024.md); [Psa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md); [Psa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012).md). They gain adherents ([Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014).md) from those who leave the fear
of God and turn to them; and מי מלא, water of fulness, i.e., of full
measure (cf. [Psa 74:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015.md), streams of
duration = that do not dry up), which is here an emblem of their corrupt
principles (cf. [Job 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016).md), is
quaffed or sucked in (מצה, root מץ, whence first of all מצץ, Arab. mṣṣ,
to suck) by these befooled ones (למו, αὐτοῖς = ὑπ ̓ αὐτῶν). This is what
is meant to be further said, and not that this band of servile followers
is in fulness absorbed by them (Sachs). Around the proud free-thinkers
there gathers a rabble submissive to them, which eagerly drinks in
everything that proceeds from them as though it were the true water of
life. Even in David's time ([Psa 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004.md);
[Psa 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md); [Psa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002).md) there were already such stout
spirits ([Isa 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#012).md) with a servûm
imitatorum pecus. A still far more favourable soil for these לצים was
the worldly age of Solomon.

[Psalms 73:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 73:11</span></span>

The persons speaking are now those apostates who, deluded by the good
fortune and free-thinking of the ungodly, give themselves up to them as
slaves. concerning the modal sense of ידע, quomodo sciverit, vid., [Psa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003.md), cf. [Job
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#013.md). With וישׁ the doubting question
is continued. Bצttcher renders thus: nevertheless knowledge is in the
Most High (a circumstantial clause like [Pro
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#028.md); [Mal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014.md); [Jdg
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#013).md); but first of all they deny
God's actual knowledge, and then His attributive omniscience. It is not
to be interpreted: behold, such are (according to their moral nature)
the ungodly (אלּה, tales, like זה, Ps 48:15, [Deu
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#026.md), cf. המּה, [Isa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011).md); nor, as is more in accordance
with the parallel member [Psa 73:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012.md)
and the drift of the Psalm: behold, thus it befalleth the ungodly (such
as they according to their lot, as in [Job
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#021.md), cf. [Isa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006).md); but, what forms a better
connection as a statement of the ground of the scepticism in [Psa
73:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#011.md), either, in harmony with the
accentuation: behold, the ungodly, etc., or, since it is not הרשׁעים:
behold, these are ungodly, and, ever reckless ([Jer
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001).md), they have acquired great power.
With the bitter הנּה, as Stier correctly observes, they bring forward
the obvious proof to the contrary. How can God be said to be the
omniscient Ruler of the world? - the ungodly in their carnal security
become very powerful and mighty, but piety, very far from being
rewarded, is joined with nothing but misfortune. My striving after
sanctity (cf. [Pro 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009).md), my
abstinence from all moral pollution (cf. [Pro
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#006).md), says he who has been led
astray, has been absolutely (אך as in [Sa1
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#021).md) in vain; I was notwithstanding
(Ew. 345, a) incessantly tormented (cf. [Psa
73:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#005).md), and with every morning's dawn
(לבּקרים, as in [Psa 101:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#008.md), cf. לבקרים
in [Job 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#018).md) my chastitive suffering
was renewed. We may now supply the conclusion in thought in accordance
with [Psa 73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010.md) : Therefore have I
joined myself to those who never concern themselves about God and at the
same time get on better.

[Psalms 73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 73:15</span></span>

To such, doubt is become the transition to apostasy. The poet has
resolved the riddle of such an unequal distribution of the fortunes of
men in a totally different way. Instead of כּמו in [Psa
73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015), to read כּמוהם (Bצttcher.md), or
better, by taking up the following הנה, which even Saadia allows himself
to do, contrary to the accents (Arab. mṯl hḏâ), כּמו הנּה (Ewald), is
unnecessary, since prepositions are sometimes used elliptically (כּעל,
[Isa 59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018).md), or even without anything
further ([Hos 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016.md); [Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007).md) as adverbs, which must therefore
be regarded as possible also in the case of כּמו (Aramaic, Arabic כּמא,
Aethiopic kem). The poet means to say, If I had made up my mind to the
same course of reasoning, I should have faithlessly forsaken the
fellowship of the children of God, and should consequently also have
forfeited their blessings. The subjunctive signification of the perfects
in the hypothetical protasis and apodosis, [Psa
73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md) (cf. [Jer
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#022).md), follows solely from the
context; futures instead of perfects would signify si dicerem...perfide
agerem. דּור בּניך is the totality of those, in whom the filial
relationship in which God has placed Isreal in relation to Himself is
become an inward or spiritual reality, the true Israel, [Psa
73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md), the "righteous generation," [Psa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md). It is an appellative, as in [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md); [Hos
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001.md). For on the point of the
uhiothesi'a the New Testament differs from the Old Testament in this
way, viz., that in the Old Testament it is always only as a people that
Israel is called בן, or as a whole בנים, but that the individual, and
that in his direct relationship to God, dared not as yet call himself
"child of God." The individual character is not as yet freed from its
absorption in the species, it is not as yet independent; it is the time
of the minor's νηπιότης, and the adoption is as yet only effected
nationally, salvation is as yet within the limits of the nationality,
its common human form has not as yet appeared. The verb בּגד with בּ
signifies to deal faithlessly with any one, and more especially (whether
God, a friend, or a spouse) faithlessly to forsake him; here, in this
sense of malicious desertion, it contents itself with the simple
accusative.

On the one side, by joining in the speech of the free-thinkers he would
have placed himself outside the circle of the children of God, of the
truly pious; on the other side, however, when by meditation he sought to
penetrate it (לדעת), the doubt-provoking phenomenon (זאת) still
continued to be to him עמל, trouble, i.e., something that troubled him
without any result, an unsolvable riddle (cf. [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017).md). Whether we read הוּא or היא,
the sense remains the same; the Ker הוּא prefers, as in [Job
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#011.md), the attractional gender.
Neither here nor in [Job 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#026.md) and
elsewhere is it to be supposed that ואחשׁבה is equivalent to ואחשׁבה
(Ewald, Hupfeld). The cohortative from of the future here, as frequently
(Ges. 128, 1), with or without a conditional particle ([Psa
139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008.md); [Sa2
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#038.md); [Job
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#006.md); [Job
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#017.md); [Job
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#018.md); [Job
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#026).md), forms a hypothetical protasis:
and (yet) when I meditated; Symmachus (according to Montfaucon), ει ̓
ἐλογιζόμην. As Vaihinger aptly observes, "thinking alone will give
neither the right light nor true happiness." Both are found only in
faith. The poet at last struck upon the way of faith, and there he found
light and peace. The future after עד frequently has the signification of
the imperfect subjunctive, [Job 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#011.md);
[Ecc 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md), cf. [Pro
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#019) (donec nutem = only a moment.md);
also in an historical connection like [Jos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md); [Ch2
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md), it is conceived of as
subjunctive (donec ulciseretur, se sanctificarent), sometimes, however,
as indicative, as in [Exo 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016.md) (donec
transibat) and in our passage, where אד introduces the objective goal at
which the riddle found its solution: until I went into the sanctuary of
God, (purposely) attended to (ל as in the primary passage [Deu
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029.md), cf. [Job
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#021).md) their life's end. The
cohortative is used here exactly as in ואבינה, but with the collateral
notion of that which is intentional, which here fully accords with the
connection. He went into God's dread sanctuary (plural as in Ps 68:36,
cf. מקדּשׁ in the Psalms of Asaph, [Psa
67:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#007.md); [Psa
78:69](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#069).md); here he prayed for light in
the darkness of his conflict, here were his eyes opened to the holy
plans and ways of God ([Psa 77:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#014).md),
here the sight of the sad end of the evil-doers was presented to him. By
"God's sanctuaries" Ewald and Hitzig understand His secrets; but this
meaning is without support in the usage of the language. And is it not a
thought perfectly in harmony with the context and with experience, that
a light arose upon him when he withdrew from the bustle of the world
into the quiet of God's dwelling - place, and there devoutly gave his
mind to the matter?

The strophe closes with a summary confession of the explanation received
there. שׁית is construed with Lamed inasmuch as collocare is equivalent
to locum assignare (vid., [Psa 73:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#006).md).
God makes the evil-doers to stand on smooth, slippery places, where one
may easily lose one's footing (cf. [Psa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006.md); [Jer
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012).md). There, then, they also
inevitably fall; God casts them down למשּׁוּאות, into ruins, fragores =
ruinae, from שׁוא = שׁאה, to be confused, desolate, to rumble. The word
only has the appearance of being from נשׁא: ensnarings, sudden attacks
(Hitzig), which is still more ill suited to [Psa
74:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#003.md) than to this passage; desolation
and ruin can be said even of persons, as הרס, [Psa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005.md), ונשׁבּרוּ, [Isa
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#015.md), נפּץ, [Jer
51:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#021.md). The poet knows no other
theodicy but this, nor was any other known generally in the pre-exilic
literature of Israel (vid., Ps 37; [Psa
39:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md), Jer. 12, and the [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001).md). The later prophecy and the
Chokma were much in advance of this, inasmuch as they point to a last
universal judgment (vid., more particularly [Mal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#013)..md), but not one that breaks off
this present state; the present state and the future state, time and
eternity, are even there not as yet thoroughly separated.

[Psalms 73:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 73:19</span></span>

The poet calms himself with the solution of the riddle that has come to
him; and it would be beneath his dignity as a man to allow himself any
further to be tempted by doubting thoughts. Placing himself upon the
standpoint of the end, he sees how the ungodly come to terrible
destruction in a moment: they come to an end (ספוּ from סוּף, not ספה),
it is all over with them (תּמּוּ) in consequence of (מן as in [Psa
76:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007.md), and unconnected as in [Psa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md); [Psa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004.md); [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014).md) frightful occurrences (בּלּהות,
a favourite word, especially in the Book of Job), which clear them out
of the way. It is with them as with a dream, after (מן as in [Ch1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#008).md) one is awoke. One forgets the
vision on account of its nothingness ([Job
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#008).md). So the evil-doers who boast
themselves μετὰ πολλῆς φαντασίας ([Act
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#023).md) are before God a צלם, a phantom
or unsubstantial shadow. When He, the sovereign Lord, shall awake, i.e.,
arouse Himself to judgment after He has looked on with forbearance, then
He will despise their shadowy image, will cast it contemptuously from
Him. Luther renders, So machstu Herr jr Bilde in der Stad verschmecht
(So dost Thou, Lord, make their image despised in the city). But neither
has the Kal בּזה this double transitive signification, "to give over to
contempt," nor is the mention of the city in place here. In [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md) also בּעיר in the signification
in urbem gives no right sense; it signifies heat of anger or fury, as in
[Jer 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008.md), heat of anguish, and
Schrder maintains the former signification (vid., on [Psa
139:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020)), in fervore (irae.md), here also;
but the pointing בּעיר is against it. Therefore בּעיר is to be regarded,
with the Targum, as syncopated from בּהעיר (cf. לביא, [Jer
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#007.md); [Ch2
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#010.md); בּכּשׁלו, [Pro
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#017), and the like.md); not, however, to
be explained, "when they awake," viz., from the sleep of death (Targum),

(Note: The Targum version is, "As the dream of a drunken man, who awakes
out of his sleep, wilt Thou, O Lord, on the day of the great judgment,
when they awake out of their graves, in wrath abandon their image to
contempt." The text of our editions is to be thus corrected according to
Bechai (on [Deu 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029).md) and Nachmani
(in his treatise שׁער הגמול).)

or after [Psa 78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038.md), "when Thou
awakest them," viz., out of their sleep of security (De Wette, Kurtz),
but after [Psa 35:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#023.md), "when Thou
awakest," viz., to sit in judgment.

Thus far we have the divine answer, which is reproduced by the poet
after the manner of prayer. Hengstenberg now goes on by rendering it,
"for my heart was incensed;" but we cannot take יתחמּץ according to the
sequence of tenses as an imperfect, nor understand כּי as a particle
expression the reason. On the contrary, the poet, from the standpoint of
the explanation he has received, speaks of a possible return (כּי seq.
fut. = ἐάν) of his temptation, and condemns it beforehand: si
exacerbaretur animus meus atque in renibus meis pungerer. התחמּץ, to
become sour, bitter, passionate; השׁתּונן, with the more exactly
defining accusative כּליותי, to be pricked, piqued, irritated. With ואני
begins the apodosis: then should I be... I should have become (perfect
as in [Psa 73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md), according to Ges.
126, 5). Concerning לא ידע, non sapere, vid., [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md). בּהמות can be taken as compar.
decurtata for כּבהמות; nevertheless, as apparently follows from [Job
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015.md), the poet surely has the
p-ehe-mou, the water ox, i.e., the hippopotamus, in his mind, which
being Hebraized is בּהמות,

(Note: The Egyptian p frequently passes over into the Hebrew b, and vice
vers, as in the name Aperiu = עברים; p, however, is retained in פרעה =
phar-aa, grand-house (οἶκος μέγας in Horapollo), the name of the
Egyptian rulers, which begins with the sign of the plan of a house = p.)

and, as a plump colossus of flesh, is at once an emblem of colossal
stupidity (Maurer, Hitzig). The meaning of the poet is, that he would
not be a man in relation to God, over against God (עם, as in [Psa
78:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#037.md); [Job
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002.md), cf. Arab. ma‛a, in comparison
with), if he should again give way to the same doubts, but would be like
the most stupid animal, which stands before God incapable of such
knowledge as He willingly imparts to earnestly inquiring man.

[Psalms 73:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 73:23</span></span>

But he does not thus deeply degrade himself: after God has once taken
him by the right hand and rescued him from the danger of falling ([Psa
73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002).md), he clings all the more firmly
to Him, and will not suffer his perpetual fellowship with Him to be
again broken through by such seizures which estrange him from God.
confidently does he yield up himself to the divine guidance, though he
may not see through the mystery of the plan (עצה) of this guidance. He
knows that afterwards (אחר with Mugrash: adverb as in [Psa
68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026).md), i.e., after this dark way of
faith, God will כבוד receive him, i.e., take him to Himself, and take
him from all suffering (לקח as in [Psa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016.md), and of Enoch, [Gen
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024).md). The comparison of [Zac
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012.md) \[8\] is misleading; there אחר is
rightly accented as a preposition: after glory hath He sent me forth
(vid., Kצhler), and here as an adverb; for although the adverbial sense
of אחר would more readily lead one to look for the arrangement of the
words ואחר תקחני כבוד, still "to receive after glory" (cf. the reverse
[Isa 58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008).md) is an awkward thought.
כבוד, which as an adjective "glorious" (Hofmann) is alien to the
language, is either accusative of the goal (Hupfeld), or, which yields a
form of expression that is more like the style of the Old Testament,
accusative of the manner (Luther, "with honour"). In אחר the poet
comprehends in one summary view what he looks for at the goal of the
present divine guidance. The future is dark to him, but lighted up by
the one hope that the end of his earthly existence will be a glorious
solution of the riddle. Here, as elsewhere, it is faith which breaks
through not only the darkness of this present life, but also the night
of Hades. At that time there was as yet no divine utterance concerning
any heavenly triumph of the church, militant in the present world, but
to faith the Jahve-Name had already a transparent depth which penetrated
beyond Hades into an eternal life. The heaven of blessedness and glory
also is nothing without God; but he who can in love call God his,
possesses heaven upon earth, and he who cannot in love call God his,
would possess not heaven, but hell, in the midst of heaven. In this
sense the poet says in [Psa 73:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#025.md) :
whom have I in heaven? i.e., who there without Thee would be the object
of my desire, the stilling of my longing? without Thee heaven with all
its glory is a vast waste and void, which makes me indifferent to
everything, and with Thee, i.e., possessing Thee, I have no delight in
the earth, because to call Thee mine infinitely surpasses every
possession and every desire of earth. If we take בּארץ still more
exactly as parallel to בּשּׁמים, without making it dependent upon
חפצתּי: and possessing Thee I have no desire upon the earth, then the
sense remains essentially the same; but if we allow בארץ to be governed
by חפצתי in accordance with the general usage of the language, we arrive
at this meaning by the most natural way. Heaven and earth, together with
angels and men, afford him no satisfaction - his only friend, his sole
desire and love, is God. The love for God which David expresses in [Psa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md) in the brief utterance, "Thou art
my Lord, Thou art my highest good," is here expanded with incomparable
mystical profoundness and beauty. Luther's version shows his
master-hand. The church follows it in its "Herzlich lieb hab' ich dich"
when it sings -

"The whole wide world delights me not,

For heaven and earth, Lord, care I not,

If I may but have Thee;"

and following it, goes on in perfect harmony with the text of our Psalm
-

"Yea, though my heart be like to break,

Thou art my trust that nought can shake;"

(Note: Miss Winkworth's translation.)

or with Paul Gerhard, \[in his Passion-hymn "Ein Lmmlein geht und trgt
die Schuld der Welt und ihrer Kinder,"

"Light of my heart, that shalt Thou be;

And when my heart in pieces breaks,

Thou shalt my heart remain."

For the hypothetical perfect כּלה expresses something in spite of which
he upon whom it may come calls God his God: licet defecerit. Though his
outward and inward man perish, nevertheless God remains ever the rock of
his heart as the firm ground upon which he, with his ego, remains
standing when everything else totters; He remains his portion, i.e., the
possession that cannot be taken from him, if he loses all, even his
spirit-life pertaining to the body, - and God remains to him this
portion לעולם, he survives with the life which he has in God the death
of the old life. The poet supposes an extreme case, - one, that is, it
is true, impossible, but yet conceivable, - that his outward and inward
being should sink away; even then with the merus actus of his ego he
will continue to cling to God. In the midst of the natural life of
perishableness and of sin, a new, individual life which is resigned to
God has begun within him, and in this he has the pledge that he cannot
perish, so truly as God, with whom it is closely united, cannot perish.
It is just this that is also the nerve of the proof of the resurrection
of the dead which Jesus advances in opposition to the Sadducees ([Mat
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032).md).

[Psalms 73:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 73:27</span></span>

The poet here once more gives expression to the great opposites into
which good fortune and misfortune are seemingly, but only seemingly,
divided in a manner so contradictory to the divine justice. The central
point of the confirmation that is introduced with כּי lies in [Psa
73:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#028.md). "Thy far removing ones" was to
be expressed with רחק, which is distinct from רחוק. זנה has מן instead
of מתּחת or מאחרי after it. Those who remove themselves far from the
primary fountain of life fall a prey to ruin; those who faithlessly
abandon God, and choose the world with its idols rather than His love,
fall a prey to destruction. Not so the poet; the nearness of God, i.e.,
a state of union with God, is good to him, i.e., (cf. [Psa
119:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#071)..md) he regards as his good
fortune. קרבה is nom. act. after the form יקהה, Arab. waqhat, obedience,
and נצּרה, a watch, [Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003.md), and of
essentially the same signification with ḳurba (קרבה), the Arabic
designation of the unio mystica; cf. [Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md), ἐγγίσατε τῷ Θεῷ καὶ ἐγγιεῖ ὑμῖν.
Just as קרבת אלהים stands in antithesis to רחקיך, so לי טּוב stands in
antithesis to יאבדו and הצמתה. To the former their alienation from God
brings destruction; he finds in fellowship with God that which is good
to him for the present time and for the future. Putting his confidence
(מחסּי, not מחסי) in Him, he will declare, and will one day be able to
declare, all His מלאכות, i.e., the manifestations or achievements of His
righteous, gracious, and wise government. The language of assertion is
quickly changed into that of address. The Psalm closes with an upward
look of grateful adoration to God beforehand, who leads His own people,
ofttimes wondrously indeed, but always happily, viz., through suffering
to glory.
