### [Genesis Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 28:1</span></span>

Jacob's Departure from his Parents' House. - Rebekah's complaint
reminded Isaac of his own call, and his consequent duty to provide for
Jacob's marriage in a manner corresponding to the divine counsels of
salvation.

[Gen 28:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001.md)

He called Jacob, therefore, and sent him to Padan-Aram to his mother's
relations, with instructions to seek a wife there, and not among the
daughters of Canaan, giving him at the same time the "blessing of
Abraham," i.e., the blessing of promise, which Abraham had repeatedly
received from the Lord, but which is more especially recorded in [Gen
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#002.md)., and [Gen
22:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md).

[Gen 28:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#006.md)

When Esau heard of this blessing and the sending away of Jacob, and saw
therein the displeasure of his parents at his Hittite wives, he went to
Ishmael - i.e., to the family of Ishmael, for Ishmael himself had been
dead fourteen years - and took as a third wife Mahalath, a daughter of
Ishmael (called Bashemath in [Gen
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#003.md), a descendant of Abraham
therefore), a step by which he might no doubt ensure the approval of his
parents, but in which he failed to consider that Ishmael had been
separated from the house of Abraham and family of promise by the
appointment of God; so that it only furnished another proof that he had
no thought of the religious interests of the chosen family, and was
unfit to be the recipient of divine revelation.

[Genesis 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 28:10</span></span>

Jacob's Dream at Bethel. - As he was travelling from Beersheba, where
Isaac was then staying ([Gen 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025).md),
to Haran, Jacob came to a place where he was obliged to stop all night,
because the sun had set. The words "he hit (lighted) upon the place,"
indicate the apparently accidental, yet really divinely appointed choice
of this place for his night-quarters; and the definite article points it
out as having become well known through the revelation of God that
ensued. After making a pillow with the stones (מאשׁת, head-place,
pillow), he fell asleep and had a dream, in which he saw a ladder
resting upon the earth, with the top reaching to heaven; and upon it
angels of God going up and down, and Jehovah Himself standing above it.
The ladder was a visible symbol of the real and uninterrupted fellowship
between God in heaven and His people upon earth. The angels upon it
carry up the wants of men to God, and bring down the assistance and
protection of God to men. The ladder stood there upon the earth, just
where Jacob was lying in solitude, poor, helpless, and forsaken by men.
Above in heaven stood Jehovah, and explained in words the symbol which
he saw. Proclaiming Himself to Jacob as the God of his fathers, He not
only confirmed to him all the promises of the fathers in their fullest
extent, but promised him protection on his journey and a safe return to
his home ([Gen 28:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013).md). But as the
fulfilment of this promise to Jacob was still far off, God added the
firm assurance, "I will not leave thee till I have done (carried out)
what I have told thee."

[Genesis 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 28:16</span></span>

Jacob gave utterance to the impression made by this vision as soon as he
awoke from sleep, in the words, "Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I
knew it not." Not that the omnipresence of God was unknown to him; but
that Jehovah in His condescending mercy should be near to him even here,
far away from his father's house and from the places consecrated to His
worship-it was this which he did not know or imagine. The revelation was
intended not only to stamp the blessing, with which Isaac had dismissed
him from his home, with the seal of divine approval, but also to impress
upon Jacob's mind the fact, that although Jehovah would be near to
protect and guide him even in a foreign land, the land of promise was
the holy ground on which the God of his fathers would set up the
covenant of His grace. On his departure from that land, he was to carry
with him a sacred awe of the gracious presence of Jehovah there. To that
end the Lord proved to him that He was near, in such a way that the
place appeared "dreadful," inasmuch as the nearness of the holy God
makes an alarming impression upon unholy man, and the consciousness of
sin grows into the fear of death. But in spite of this alarm, the place
was none other than "the house of God and the gate of heaven," i.e., a
place where God dwelt, and a way that opened to Him in heaven.

[Genesis 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 28:18</span></span>

In the morning Jacob set up the stone at his head, as a monument (מצּבה)
to commemorate the revelation he had received from God; and poured oil
upon the top, to consecrate it as a memorial of the mercy that had been
shown him there (visionis insigne μνημόσυνον, Calvin), not as an idol or
an object or divine worship (vid., [Exo
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#026)..md). - He then gave the place the
name of Bethel, i.e., House of God, whereas (ואוּלם) the town had been
called Luz before. This antithesis shows that Jacob gave the name, not
to the place where the pillar was set up, but to the town, in the
neighbourhood of which he had received the divine revelation. He renewed
it on his return from Mesopotamia ([Gen
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#015).md). This is confirmed by [Gen
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#003.md), where Jacob, like the historian
in [Gen 35:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#006.md), speaks of Luz as the
place of this revelation. There is nothing at variance with this in [Jos
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002.md); [Jos
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013.md); for it is not Bethel as a city,
but the mountains of Bethel, that are there distinguished from Luz (see
my Commentary on [Jos 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002).md).

(Note: The fact mentioned here has often been cited as the origin of the
anointed stones (βαίτυλοι) of the heathen, and this heathen custom has
been regarded as a degeneration of the patriarchal. But apart from this
essential difference, that the Baetulian worship was chiefly connected
with meteoric stones (cf. F. von Dalberg, @fcb. d. Meteor-cultus d.
Alten), which were supposed to have come down from some god, and were
looked upon as deified, this opinion is at variance with the
circumstance, that Jacob himself, in consecrating the stone by pouring
oil upon it, only followed a custom already established, and still more
with the fact, that the name βαίτυλοι, Βαιτόλια, notwithstanding its
sounding like Bethel, can hardly have arisen from the name Beth-El, Gr.
Βαιθήλ, since the τ for θ would be perfectly inexplicable. Dietrich
derives βαιτύλιον from בּטּל, to render inoperative, and interprets it
amulet.)

[Genesis 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 28:20</span></span>

Lastly, Jacob made a vow: that if God would give him the promised
protection on his journey, and bring him back in safety to his father's
house, Jehovah should be his God (והיה in [Gen
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#021) commences the apodosis.md), the
stone which he had set up should be a house of God, and Jehovah should
receive a tenth of all that He gave to him. It is to be noticed here,
that Elohim is used in the protasis instead of Jehovah, as constituting
the essence of the vow: if Jehovah, who had appeared to him, proved
Himself to be God by fulfilling His promise, then he would acknowledge
and worship Him as his God, by making the stone thus set up into a house
of God, i.e., a place of sacrifice, and by tithing all his possessions.
With regard to the fulfilment of this vow, we learn from [Gen
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#007.md) that Jacob built an altar, and
probably also dedicated the tenth to God, i.e., offered it to Jehovah;
or, as some have supposed, applied it partly to the erection and
preservation of the altar, and partly to burnt and thank-offerings
combined with sacrificial meals, according to the analogy of [Deu
14:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md) (cf. [Gen
31:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#054.md); [Gen
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001).md).
