Judgment of Devastation upon the Vineyard of Jehovah - Isaiah 5

The foregoing prophecy has run through all the different phases of
prophetic exhortation by the time that we reach the close of [Isa
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md); and its leading thought, viz.,
the overthrow of the false glory of Israel, and the perfect
establishment of true glory through the medium of judgment, has been so
fully worked out, that chapter 5 cannot possibly be regarded either as a
continuation or as an appendix to that address. Unquestionably there are
many points in which chapter 5 refers back to chapters 2-4. The parable
of the vineyard in [Isa 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md) grows,
as it were, out of [Isa 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014.md); and in
[Isa 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015.md) we have a repetition of the
refrain in [Isa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md), varied in a
similar manner to [Isa 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017.md). But these
and other points of contact with chapters 2-4, whilst they indicate a
tolerable similarity in date, by no means prove the absence of
independence in chapter 5. The historical circumstances of the two
addresses are the same; and the range of thought is therefore closely
related. But the leading idea which is carried out in chapter 5 is a
totally different one. The basis of the address is a parable
representing Israel as the vineyard of Jehovah, which, contrary to all
expectation, had produced bad fruit, and therefore was given up to
devastation. What kind of bad fruit it produced is described in a
six-fold "woe;" and what kind of devastation was to follow is indicated
in the dark nocturnal conclusion to the whole address, which is entirely
without a promise.

[Isaiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 5:1</span></span>

The prophet commenced his first address in chapter 1 like another Moses;
the second, which covered no less ground, he opened with the text of an
earlier prophecy; and now he commences the third like a musician,
addressing both himself and his hearers with enticing words. [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md). "Arise, I will sing of my
beloved, a song of my dearest touching his vineyard." The fugitive
rhythm, the musical euphony, the charming assonances in this appeal, it
is impossible to reproduce. They are perfectly inimitable. The Lamed in
lı̄dı̄dı̄ is the Lamed objecti. The person to whom the song referred, to
whom it applied, of whom it treated, was the singer's own beloved. It
was a song of his dearest one (not his cousin, patruelis, as Luther
renders it in imitation of the Vulgate, for the meaning of dōd is
determined by yâdid, beloved) touching his vineyard. The Lamed in
l'carmo is also Lamed objecti. The song of the beloved is really a song
concerning the vineyard of the beloved; and this song is a song of the
beloved himself, not a song written about him, or attributed to him, but
such a song as he himself had sung, and still had to sing. The prophet,
by beginning in this manner, was surrounded (either in spirit or in
outward reality) by a crowd of people from Jerusalem and Judah. The song
is a short one, and runs thus in [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md), [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md) : "My beloved had a vineyard on a
fatly nourished mountain-horn, and dug it up and cleared it of stones,
and planted it with noble vines, and built a tower in it, and also hewed
out a wine-press therein; and hoped that it would bring forth grapes,
and it brought forth wild grapes." The vineyard was situated upon a
keren, i.e., upon a prominent mountain peak projecting like a horn, and
therefore open to the sun on all sides; for, as Virgil says in the
Georgics, "apertos Bacchus amat colles." This mountain horn was
ben-shemen, a child of fatness: the fatness was innate, it belonged to
it by nature (shemen is used, as in [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md), to denote the fertility of a
nutritive loamy soil). And the owner of the vineyard spared no attention
or trouble. The plough could not be used, from the steepness of the
mountain slope: he therefore dug it up, that is to say, he turned up the
soil which was to be made into a vineyard with a hoe (izzēk, to hoe;
Arab. mi‛zak, mi‛zaka); and as he found it choked up with stones and
boulders, he got rid of this rubbish by throwing it out sikkēl, a
privative piel, lapidibus purgare, then operam consumere in lapides, sc.
ejiciendos, to stone, or clear of stones: Ges. 52, 2). After the soil
had been prepared he planted it with sorek, i.e., the finest kind of
eastern vine, bearing small grapes of a bluish-red, with pips hardly
perceptible to the tongue. The name is derived from its colour (compare
the Arabic zerka, red wine). To protect and adorn the vineyard which had
been so richly planted, he built a tower in the midst of it. The
expression "and also" calls especial attention to the fact that he hewed
out a wine-trough therein (yekeb, the trough into which the must or
juice pressed from the grapes in the wine-press flows, lacus as
distinguished from torcular); that is to say, in order that the trough
might be all the more fixed and durable, he constructed it in a rocky
portion of the ground (Châtsēb bo instead of Chătsab bo, with a and the
accent drawn back, because a Beth was thereby easily rendered inaudible,
so that Châtsēb is not a participial adjective, as Bttcher supposes).
This was a difficult task, as the expression "and also" indicates; and
for that very reason it was an evidence of the most confident
expectation. But how bitterly was this deceived! The vineyard produced
no such fruit, as might have been expected from a sorek plantation; it
brought forth no ‛anâbim whatever, i.e., no such grapes as a cultivated
vine should bear, but only b'ushim, or wild grapes. Luther first of all
adopted the rendering wild grapes, and then altered it to harsh or sour
grapes. But it comes to the same thing. The difference between a wild
vine and a good vine is only qualitative. The vitis vinifera, like all
cultivated plants, is assigned to the care of man, under which it
improves; whereas in its wild state it remains behind its true intention
(see Genesis, 622). Consequently the word b'ushim (from bâ'ash, to be
bad, or smell bad) denotes not only the grapes of the wild vine, which
are naturally small and harsh (Rashi, lambruches, i.e., grapes of the
labrusca, which is used now, however, as the botanical name of a vine
that is American in its origin), but also grapes of a good stock, which
have either been spoiled or have failed to ripen.

(Note: In the Jerusalem Talmud such grapes are called ūbshin, the
letters being transposed; and in the Mishnah (Ma'aseroth i. 2, Zeb'ith
iv 8) הבאישׁ is the standing word applied to grapes that are only half
ripe (see Lwy's Leshon Chachamim, or Wrterbuch des talmudischen
Hebrisch, Prag 1845). With reference to the wild grape (τὸ ἀγριόκλημα),
a writer, describing the useful plants of Greece, says, "Its fruit (τὰ
ἀγριοστάφυλα) consists of very small berries, not much larger than
bilberries, with a harsh flavour.")

These were the grapes which the vineyard produced, such as you might
indeed have expected from a wild vine, but not from carefully cultivated
vines of the very choicest kind.

[Isaiah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 5:3</span></span>

The song of the beloved who was so sorely deceived terminates here. The
prophet recited it, not his beloved himself; but as they were both of
one heart and one soul, the prophet proceeds thus in [Isa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003.md) and [Isa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004.md) : "And now, O inhabitants of
Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my
vineyard! What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not
done in it? Wherefore did I hope that it would bring forth grapes, and
it brought forth wild grapes?" The fact that the prophet speaks as if he
were the beloved himself, shows at once who the beloved must be. The
beloved of the prophet and the lover of the prophet (yâdid and dōd) were
Jehovah, with whom he was so united by a union mystica exalted above all
earthly love, that, like the angel of Jehovah in the early histories, he
could speak as if he were Jehovah Himself (see especially [Zac
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012).md). To any one with spiritual
intuition, therefore, the parabolical meaning and object of the song
would be at once apparent; and even the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the
men of Judah (yoosheeb and iish are used collectively, as in [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md); [Isa
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008.md); [Isa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#021.md), cf., [Isa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006).md) were not so stupefied by sin,
that they could not perceive to what the prophet was leading. It was for
them to decide where the guilt of this unnatural issue lay - that is to
say, of this thorough contradiction between the "doing" of the vineyard
and the "doing" of the Lord; that instead of the grapes he hoped for, it
brought forth wild grapes. (On the expression "what could have been
done," quid faciendum est, mah-la'asoth, see at [Hab
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017), Ges. 132, Anm. 1..md) Instead of
למה (למּה) we have the more suitable term מדּוּע, the latter being used
in relation to the actual cause (Causa efficiens), the former in
relation to the object (Causa finalis). The parallel to the second part,
viz., [Isa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002.md), resembles the passage
before us, not only in the use of this particular word, but also in the
fact that there, as well as here, it relates to both clauses, and more
especially to the latter of the two. We find the same paratactic
construction in connection with other conjunctions (cf., [Isa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md); [Isa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012).md). They were called upon to
decide and answer as to this what and wherefore; but they were silent,
just because they could clearly see that they would have to condemn
themselves (as David condemned himself in connection with Nathan's
parable, [Sa2 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#005).md). The Lord of the
vineyard, therefore, begins to speak. He, its accuser, will now also be
its judge.

[Isaiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 5:5</span></span>

"Now then, I will tell you what I will do at once to my vineyard: take
away its hedge, and it shall be for grazing; pull down its wall, and it
shall be for treading down." Before "now then" (vattâh) we must imagine
a pause, as in [Isa 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014.md). The Lord of
the vineyard breaks the silence of the umpires, which indicates their
consciousness of guilt. They shall hear from Him what He will do at once
to His vineyard (Lamed in l'carmi, as, for example, in [Deu
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006).md). "I will do:" ani 'ōeh, fut.
instans, equivalent to facturus sum (Ges. 134, 2, b). In the inf. abs.
which follow He opens up what He will do. On this explanatory use of the
inf. abs., see [Isa 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002.md); [Isa
58:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md). In such cases as these it
takes the place of the object, as in other cases of the subject, but
always in an abrupt manner (Ges. 131, 1). He would take away the
mesucah, i.e., the green thorny hedge ([Pro
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#019.md); [Hos
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008).md) with which the vineyard was
enclosed, and would pull down the gârēd, i.e., the low stone wall ([Num
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#024.md); [Pro
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#031).md), which had been surrounded by
the hedge of thorn-bushes to make a better defence, as well as for the
protection of the wall itself, more especially against being undermined;
so that the vineyard would be given up to grazing and treading down (lxx
καταπα'τημα), i.e., would become an open way and gathering-place for man
and beast.

[Isaiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 5:6</span></span>

This puts an end to the unthankful vineyard, and indeed a hopeless
one."And I will put an end to it: it shall not be pruned nor digged, and
it shall break out in thorns and thistles; and I will command the clouds
to rain no rain over it." "Put an end:" bâthâh (= battâh : Ges. 67, Anm.
11) signifies, according to the primary meaning of bâthath (בּוּת, בּהת,
see at [Isa 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029).md), viz., abscindere,
either abscissum = locus abscissus or praeruptus ([Isa
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#019).md), or abscissio = deletio. The
latter is the meaning here, where shı̄th bâthâh is a refined expression
for the more usual כלה עשׂה, both being construed with the accusative of
the thing which is brought to an end. Further pruning and hoeing would
do it no good, but only lead to further disappointment: it was the will
of the Lord, therefore, that the deceitful vineyard should shoot up in
thorns and thistles (âlâh is applied to the soil, as in [Isa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013.md) and [Pro
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#031.md); shâimr vâshaith, thorns and
thistles, are in the accusative, according to Ges. 138, 1, Anm. 2; and
both the words themselves, and also their combination, are exclusively
and peculiarly Isaiah's).

(Note: Cassel associates shâmir as the name of a plant (saxifraga) with
σμὐρις, and shaith with sentis, ἄκανθα; but the name shâmir is not at
all applicable to those small delicate plants, which are called
saxifraga (stone-breakers) on account of their growing out of clefts in
the rock, and so appearing to have split the rock itself. Both shâmir
vâshaith and kōts v'dardar, in [Gen
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018.md), seem rather to point to certain
kinds of rhamnus, together with different kinds of thistles. The more
arid and waste the ground is, the more does it abound, where not
altogether without vegetation, in thorny, prickly, stunted productions.)

In order that it might remain a wilderness, the clouds would also
receive commandment from the Lord not to rain upon it. There can be no
longer any doubt who the Lord of the vineyard is. He is Lord of the
clouds, and therefore the Lord of heaven and earth. It is He who is the
prophet's beloved and dearest one. The song which opened in so
minstrel-like and harmless a tone, has now become painfully severe and
terribly repulsive. The husk of the parable, which has already been
broken through, now falls completely off (cf., [Mat
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013.md); [Mat
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030).md). What it sets forth in symbol
is really true. This truth the prophet establishes by an open
declaration.

[Isaiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 5:7</span></span>

"For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the
men of Judah are the plantation of His delight: He waited for justice,
and behold grasping; for righteousness, and behold a shriek." The
meaning is not that the Lord of the vineyard would not let any more rain
fall upon it, because this Lord was Jehovah (which is not affirmed in
fact in the words commencing with "for," Ci), but a more general one.
This was how the case stood with the vineyard; for all Israel, and
especially the people of Judah, were this vineyard, which had so
bitterly deceived the expectations of its Lord, and indeed "the vineyard
of Jehovah of hosts," and therefore of the omnipotent God, whom even the
clouds would serve when He came forth to punish. The expression "for"
(Ci) is not only intended to vindicate the truth of the last statement,
but the truth of the whole simile, including this: it is an explanatory
"for" (Ci explic.), which opens the epimythion. "The vineyard of the
Lord of hosts" (Cerem Jehovah Zebaoth) is the predicate. "The house of
Israel (Beth Yisrâel) was the whole nation, which is also represented in
other passages under the same figure of a vineyard ([Isa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002).; Ps 80, etc..md). But as Isaiah was
prophet in Judah, he applies the figure more particularly to Judah,
which was called Jehovah's favourite plantation, inasmuch as it was the
seat of the divine sanctuary and of the Davidic kingdom. This makes it
easy enough to interpret the different parts of the simile employed. The
fat mountain-horn was Canaan, flowing with milk and honey ([Exo
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017).md); the digging of the vineyard,
and clearing it of stones, was the clearing of Canaan from its former
heathen inhabitants ([Psa 54:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#003).md); the
sorek-vines were the holy priests and prophets and kings of Israel of
the earlier and better times ([Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021).md); the defensive and ornamental
tower in the midst of the vineyard was Jerusalem as the royal city, with
Zion the royal fortress ([Mic 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008).md);
the winepress-trough was the temple, where, according to [Psa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009) (8..md), the wine of heavenly
pleasures flowed in streams, and from which, according to [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) and many other passages, the
thirst of the soul might all be quenched. The grazing and treading down
are explained in [Jer 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md) and [Jer
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#010.md). The bitter deception
experienced by Jehovah is expressed in a play upon two words, indicating
the surprising change of the desired result into the very opposite. The
explanation which Gesenius, Caspari, Knobel, and others give of mispâch,
viz., bloodshed, does not commend itself; for even if it must be
admitted that sâphach occurs once or twice in the "Arabizing" book of
Job ([Job 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#007.md); [Job
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019).md) in the sense of pouring out,
this verbal root is strange to the Hebrew (and the Aramaean). Moreover,
mispâch in any case would only mean pouring or shedding, and not
bloodshed; and although the latter would certainly be possible by the
side of the Arabic saffâch, saffâk (shedder of blood), yet it would be
such an ellipsis as cannot be shown anywhere else in Hebrew usage. On
the other hand, the rendering "leprosy" does not yield any appropriate
sense, as mispachath (sappachath) is never generalized anywhere else
into the single idea of "dirt" (Luzzatto: sozzura), nor does it appear
as an ethical notion. We therefore prefer to connect it with a meaning
unquestionably belonging to the verb ספח (see kal, [Sa1
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#036.md); niphal, [Isa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001.md); hithpael, [Sa1
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019).md), which is derived in יסף, אסף,
סוּף, from the primary notion "to sweep," spec. to sweep towards, sweep
in, or sweep away. Hence we regard mispach as denoting the forcible
appropriation of another man's property; certainly a suitable antithesis
to mishpât. The prophet describes, in full-toned figures, how the
expected noble grapes had turned into wild grapes, with nothing more
than an outward resemblance. The introduction to the prophecy closes
here.

The prophecy itself follows next, a seven-fold discourse composed of the
six-fold woe contained in vv. 8-23, and the announcement of punishment
in which it terminates. In this six-fold woe the prophet describes the
bad fruits one by one. In confirmation of our rendering of mispâch, the
first woe relates to covetousness and avarice as the root of all evil.

[Isaiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 5:8</span></span>

"Woe unto them that join house to house, who lay field to field, till
there is no more room, and ye alone are dwelling in the midst of the
land." The participle is continued in the finite verb, as in [Isa
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#023.md); [Isa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md); the regular syntactic
construction is cases of this kind (Ges. 134, Anm. 2). The preterites
after "till" (there are to such preterites, for 'ephes is an intensified
אין enclosing the verbal idea) correspond to future perfects: "They, the
insatiable, would not rest till, after every smaller piece of landed
property had been swallowed by them, the whole land had come into their
possession, and no one beside themselves was settled in the land" ([Job
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#008).md). Such covetousness was all the
more reprehensible, because the law of Israel and provided so very
stringently and carefully, that as far as possible there should be an
equal distribution of the soil, and that hereditary family property
should be inalienable. All landed property that had been alienated
reverted to the family every fiftieth year, or year of jubilee; so that
alienation simply had reference to the usufruct of the land till that
time. It was only in the case of houses in towns that the right of
redemption was restricted to one year, at least according to a later
statute. How badly the law of the year of jubilee had been observed, may
be gathered from Jer 34, where we learn that the law as to the
manumission of Hebrew slaves in the sabbatical year had fallen entirely
into neglect. Isaiah's contemporary, Micah, makes just the same
complaint as Isaiah himself (vid., [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 5:9</span></span>

And the denunciation of punishment is made by him in very similar terms
to those which we find here in [Isa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009.md), [Isa
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#010.md) : "Into mine ears Jehovah of
hosts: Of a truth many houses shall become a wilderness, great and
beautiful ones deserted. For ten yokes of vineyard will yield one
pailful, and a quarter of seed-corn will produce a bushel." We may see
from [Isa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#014.md) in what sense the
prophet wrote the substantive clause, "Into mine ears," or more
literally, "In mine ears is Jehovah Zebaoth," viz., He is here revealing
Himself to me. In the pointing, בּאזני is written with tiphchah as a
pausal form, to indicate to the reader that the boldness of the
expression is to be softened down by the assumption of an ellipsis. In
Hebrew, "to say into the ears" did not mean to "speak softly and
secretly," as [Gen 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010.md), [Gen
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016.md); [Job
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#008.md), and other passages, clearly
show; but to speak in a distinct and intelligible manner, which
precludes the possibility of any misunderstanding. The prophet, indeed,
had not Jehovah standing locally beside him; nevertheless, he had Him
objectively over against his own personality, and was well able to
distinguish very clearly the thoughts and words of his own personality,
from the words of Jehovah which arose audibly within him. These words
informed him what would be the fate of the rich and insatiable
landowners. "Of a truth:" אם־לא (if not) introduces an oath of an
affirmative character (the complete formula is Chai ani 'im-lo', "as I
live if not"), just as 'im (if) alone introduces a negative oath (e.g.,
[Num 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#023).md). The force of the
expression 'im-lo' extends not only to rabbim, as the false accentuation
with gershayim (double-geresh) would make it appear, but to the whole of
the following sentence, as it is correctly accentuated with rebia in the
Venetian (1521) and other early editions. A universal desolation would
ensue: rabbim (many) does not mean less than all; but the houses
(bâttim, as the word should be pronounced, notwithstanding Ewald's
objection to Khler's remarks on [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md); cf., [Job
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001) :31.md) constituted altogether a
very large number (compare the use of the word "many" in [Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md); [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028), etc..md). מאין is a double, and
therefore an absolute, negation (so that there is not, no inhabitant,
i.e., not any inhabitant at all). [Isa
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#010.md), which commences, with Ci,
explains how such a desolation of the houses would be brought about:
failure of crops produces famine, and this is followed by depopulation.
"Ten zimdē (with dagesh lene, Ewald) of vineyard" are either ten pieces
of the size that a man could plough in one day with a yoke of oxen, or
possibly ten portions of yoke-like espaliers of vines, i.e., of vines
trained on cross laths (the vina jugata of Varro), which is the
explanation adopted by Biesenthal. But if we compare [Sa1
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#014.md), the former is to be preferred,
although the links are wanting which would enable us to prove that the
early Israelites had one and the same system of land measure as the
Romans;

(Note: On the jugerum, see Hultsch, Griechische und rmische Metrologie,
1862. The Greek plethron, which was smaller by two and a half,
corresponded to some extent to this; also the Homeric tetraguon, which
cannot be more precisely defined (according to Eustathius, it was a
piece of land which a skilful labourer could plough in one day).
According to Herod. ii. 168, in the Egyptian square-measure an a'roura
was equal to 150 cubits square. The Palestinian, according to the tables
of Julian the Ashkalonite, was the plethron. "The plethron," he says,
"was ten perches, or fifteen fathoms, or thirty paces, sixty cubits,
ninety feet" (for the entire text, see L. F. V. Fennersberg's
Untersuchungen ber alte Langen-, Feld-, und Wegemaase, 1859).
Fennersberg's conclusion is, that the tzemed was a plethron, equal in
length to ten perches of nine feet each. But the meaning of the word
tzemed is of more importance in helping to determine the measure
referred to, than the tables of long measure of the architect of
Ashkalon, which have been preserved in the imperial collection of laws
of Constantine Harmenopulos, and which probably belong to a much later
period.)

nevertheless Arab. fddân (in Hauran) is precisely similar, and this word
signifies primarily a yoke of oxen, and then a yoke (jugerum) regarded
as a measure of land. Ten days' work would only yield a single bath.
This liquid measure, which was first introduced in the time of the
kings, corresponded to the ephah in dry measure ([Eze
45:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#011).md). According to Josephus (Ant.
viii. 2, 9), it was equal to seventy-two Roman sextarii, i.e., a little
more than thirty-three Berlin quarts; but in the time of Isaiah it was
probably smaller. The homer, a dry measure, generally called a Cor after
the time of the kings, was equal to ten Attic medimnoi;

(Note: Or rather 7 1/2 Attic medimnoi = 10 Attic metretoi = 45 Roman
modia (see Bckh, Metrologische Untersuchungen, p. 259).)

a medimnos being (according to Josephus, Ant. xv 9, 2) about 15-16ths of
a Berlin bushel, and therefore a little more than fifteen pecks. Even if
this quantity of corn should be sown, they would not reap more than an
ephah.The harvest, therefore, would only yield the tenth part of the
sowing, since an ephah was the tenth part of a homer, or three seahs,
the usual minimum for one baking (vid., [Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033).md). It is, of course, impossible
to give the relative measure exactly in our translation.

[Isaiah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 5:11</span></span>

The second woe, for which the curse about to fall upon vinedressing
([Isa 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#010).md) prepared the way by the
simple association of ideas, is directed against the debauchees, who in
their carnal security carried on their excesses even in the daylight.
"Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning to run after strong
drink; who continue till late at night with wine inflaming them!" Boker
(from bâkar, bakara, to slit, to tear up, or split) is the break of day;
and nesheph (from nâshaph, to blow) the cool of the evening, including
the night ([Isa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#004.md); [Isa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010).md); 'ichr, to continue till late,
as in [Pro 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#030.md) : the construct state
before words with a preposition, as in [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md); [Isa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009.md), and many other passages (Ges.
116, 1). Shēcâr, in connection with yayin, is the general name for every
other kind of strong drink, more especially for wines made artificially
from fruit, honey, raisins, dates, etc., including barley-wine (οἶνος
κρίθινος) or beer (ἐκ κριθῶν μέθυ in Aeschylus, also called βρῦτον
βρυτόν ζῦθος ζύθος, and by many other names), a beverage known in Egypt,
which was half a wine country and half a beer country, from as far back
as the time of the Pharaohs. The form shēcâr is composed, like ענב (with
the fore-tone tsere), from shâcar, to intoxicate; according to the
Arabic, literally to close by stopping up, i.e., to stupefy.

(Note: It is a question, therefore, whether the name of sugar is related
to it or not. The Arabic sakar corresponds to the Hebrew shecâr; but
sugar is called sukkar, Pers. 'sakkar, 'sakar, no doubt equivalent to
σἀκχαρι (Arrian in Periplus, μἐλι τὸ καλἀμινον τὸ λεγὀμενου σἀκχαρι),
saccharum, an Indian word, which is pronounced Carkarâ in Sanscrit and
sakkara in Prakrit, and signifies "forming broken pieces," i.e., sugar
in grains or small lumps (brown sugar). The art of boiling sugar from
the cane was an Indian invention (see Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde,
i. 269ff.). The early Egyptian name for beer is hek (Brugsch, Recueil,
p. 118); the demotic and hieratic name henk, the Coptic henke. The word
ζῦθος ζὐθος) is also old Egyptian. In the Book of the Dead (79, 8) the
deceased says, "I have taken sacrificial cakes from the table, I have
drunk seth-t in the evening." Moses Stuart wrote an Essay upon the Wines
and Strong Drinks of the Ancient Hebrews, which was published in London
(1831), with a preface by J. Pye Smith.)

The clauses after the two participles are circumstantial clauses (Ewald,
341, b), indicating the circumstances under which they ran out so early,
and sat till long after dark: they hunted after mead, they heated
themselves with wine, namely, to drown the consciousness of their deeds
of darkness.

[Isaiah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 5:12</span></span>

[Isa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md) describes how they go on in
their blindness with music and carousing: "And guitar and harp,
kettle-drum, and flute, and wine, is their feast; but they regard not
the work of Jehovah, and see not the purpose of His hands." "Their
feast" is so and so (משׁתּיהם is only a plural in appearance; it is
really a singular, as in [Dan 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#010.md),
[Dan 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#016.md), and many other passages,
with the Yod of the primary form, משׁתּי = משׁתּה, softened: see the
remarks on עלה at [Isa 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#030.md), and עשׂיה
at [Isa 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011).md); that is to say, their
feast consisted or was composed of exciting music and wine. Knobel
construes it, "and there are guitar, etc., and wine is their drink;" but
a divided sentence of this kind is very tame; and the other expression,
based upon the general principle, "The whole is its parts," is
thoroughly Semitic (see Fleischer's Abhandlungen ber einige Arten der
Nominalapposition in den Sitzungsberichten der schs. Gesellschaft der
Wissenschaft, 1862). Cinnor (guitar) is a general name for such
instruments as have their strings drawn (upon a bridge) over a sounding
board; and nebel (the harp and lyre) a general name for instruments with
their strings hung freely, so as to be played with both hands at the
same time. Toph (Arab. duff) is a general name for the tambourin, the
drum, and the kettle-drum; Chaill (lit. that which is bored through) a
general name for the flute and double flute. In this tumult and riot
they had no thought or eye for the work of Jehovah and the purpose of
His hands. This is the phrase used to express the idea of eternal
counsel of God ([Isa 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026).md), which
leads to salvation by the circuitous paths of judgment ([Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md); [Isa
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021.md); [Isa
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023).md), so far as that counsel is
embodied in history, as moulded by the invisible interposition of God.
In their joy and glory they had no sense for what was the most glorious
of all, viz., the moving and working of God in history; so that they
could not even discern the judgment which was in course of preparation
at that very time.

[Isaiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 5:13</span></span>

Therefore judgment would overtake them in this blind, dull, and stupid
animal condition. "Therefore my people go into banishment without
knowing; and their glory will become starving men, and their tumult men
dried up with thirst." As the word "therefore" (lâcēn, as in [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024).md) introduces the threat of
punishment, gâlâh (go into captivity) is a prophetic preterite. Israel
would go into exile, and that "without knowing" (mibb'li-da'ath). The
meaning of this expression cannot be "from want of knowledge," since the
min which is fused into one word with b'li is not causal, but negative,
and mibb'li, as a preposition, always signifies "without" (absque). But
are we to render it "without knowing it" (as in [Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006), where hadda'ath has the article.md),
or "unawares?" There is no necessity for any dispute on this point,
since the two renderings are fundamentally one and the same. The
knowledge, of which [Isa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md)
pronounces them destitute, was more especially a knowledge of the
judgment of God that was hanging over them; so that, as the captivity
would come upon them without knowledge, it would necessarily come upon
them unawares. "Their glory" (Cebōdō) and "their tumult" (hamono) are
therefore to be understood, as the predicates show, as collective nouns
used in a personal sense, the former signifying the more select portion
of the nation (cf., [Mic 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#015).md), the
latter the mass of the people, who were living in rioting and tumult.
The former would become "men of famine" (mĕthē rââb: מתי, like אנשׁי in
other places, viz., [Sa2 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#029.md), or
בּני, [Sa1 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#016).md); the latter "men
dried up with thirst" (tsichēh tsâmâh: the same number as the subject).
There is no necessity to read מתי (dead men) instead of מתי, as the lxx
and Vulgate do, or מזי (מזה) according to [Deu
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#024.md), as Hitzig, Ewald, Bttcher, and
others propose (compare, on the contrary, [Gen
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030.md) and [Job
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#011).md). The adjective tzicheh (hapax
leg) is formed like Chirēsh, Cēheh, and other adjectives which indicate
defects: in such formations from verbs Lamed - He, instead of e we have
an ae that has grown out of ay (Olshausen, 182, b). The rich gluttons
would starve, and the tippling crowd would die with thirst.

[Isaiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 5:14</span></span>

The threat of punishment commences again with "therefore;" it has not
yet satisfied itself, and therefore grasps deeper still. "Therefore the
under-world opens its jaws wide, and stretches open its mouth
immeasurably wide; and the glory of Jerusalem descends, and its tumult,
and noise, and those who rejoice within it." The verbs which follow
lâcēn (therefore) are prophetic preterites, as in [Isa
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md). The feminine suffixes attached
to what the lower world swallows up do not refer to sheol (though this
is construed more frequently, no doubt, as a feminine than as a
masculine, as it is in [Job 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006).md),
but, as expressed in the translation, to Jerusalem itself, which is also
necessarily required by the last clause, "those who rejoice within it."
The withdrawal of the tone from ועלז to the penultimate (cf., Châphētz
in [Psa 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md); [Psa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009).md) is intentionally omitted, to
cause the rolling and swallowing up to be heard as it were. A mouth is
ascribed to the under-world, also a nephesh, i.e., a greedy soul, in
which sense nephesh is then applied metonymically sometimes to a thirst
for blood ([Psa 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012).md), and sometimes
to simple greediness ([Isa 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011).md), and
even, as in the present passage and [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), to the throat or swallow which
the soul opens "without measure," when its craving knows no bounds
(Psychol. p. 204). It has become a common thing now to drop entirely the
notion which formerly prevailed, that the noun sheol was derived from
the verb shâal in the sense in which it was generally employed, viz., to
ask or demand; but Caspari, who has revived it again, is certainly so
far correct, that the derivation of the word which the prophet had in
his mind was this and no other. The word sheol (an infinitive form, like
pekōd) signifies primarily the irresistible and inexorable demand made
upon every earthly thing; and then secondarily, in a local sense, the
place of the abode of shades, to which everything on the surface of the
earth is summoned; or essentially the divinely appointed curse which
demands and swallows up everything upon the earth. We simply maintain,
however, that the word sheol, as generally sued, was associated in
thought with shâal, to ask or demand. Originally, no doubt, it may have
been derived from the primary and more material idea of the verb שׁאל,
possibly from the meaning "to be hollow," which is also assumed to be
the primary meaning of שׁעל.

(Note: The meaning "to be hollow" is not very firmly established,
however; as the primary meaning of שׁעל, and the analogy sometimes
adduced of hell = hollow (Hlle = Hhle), is a deceptive one, as Hlle
(hell), to which Luther always gives the more correct form Helle, does
not mean a hollow, but a hidden place (or a place which renders
invisible: from hln, to conceal), Lat. celans (see Jtting, Bibl.
Wrterbuch, 1864, pp. 85, 86). It is much more probable that the meaning
of sheol is not the hollow place, but the depression or depth, from של,
which corresponds precisely to the Greek χαλᾶν so far as its primary
meaning is concerned (compare the talmudic shilshêl, to let down;
shilshul, sinking or depression, Erubin 83b; shul, the foundation,
fundus): see Hupfeld on [Psa 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md).
Luzzatto on this passage also explains sheol as signifying depth, and
compares the talmudic hishchil = hēshil, to let down (or, according to
others, to draw up - two meanings which may easily be combined in the
same word, starting from its radical idea, which indicates in a general
a loosening of the previous connection). Frst has also given up the
meaning cavitas, a hollow, and endeavours to find a more correct
explanation of the primary signification of shâ'al (see at [Isa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012))..md)

At any rate, this derivation answers to the view that generally
prevailed in ancient times. According to the prevalent idea, Hades was
in the interior of the earth. And there was nothing really absurd in
this, since it is quite within the power and freedom of the omnipresent
God to manifest Himself wherever and however He may please. As He
reveals Himself above the earth, i.e., in heaven, among blessed spirits
in the light of His love; so did He reveal Himself underneath the earth,
viz., in Sheōl, in the darkness and fire of His wrath. And with the
exception of Enoch and Elijah, with their marvellous departure from this
life, the way of every mortal ended there, until the time when Jesus
Christ, having first paid the λὐτρον, i.e., having shed His blood, which
covers our guilt and turns the wrath of God into love, descended into
Hades and ascended into heaven, and from that time forth has changed the
death of all believers from a descent into Hades into an ascension to
heaven. But even under the Old Testament the believer may have known,
that whoever hid himself on this side the grave in Jehovah the living
One, would retain his eternal germ of life even in Sheōl in the midst of
the shades, and would taste the love of God even in the midst of wrath.
It was this postulate of faith which lay at the foundation of the fact,
that even under the Old Testament the broader and more comprehensive
idea of Sheōl began to be contracted into the more limited notion of
hell (see Psychol. p. 415). This is the case in the passage before us,
where Isaiah predicts of everything of which Jerusalem was proud, and in
which it revelled, including the persons who rejoice din these things, a
descent into Hades; just as the Korahite author of Ps 49 wrote ([Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014).md) that the beauty of the wicked
would be given up to Hades to be consumed, without having hereafter any
place in the upper world, when the upright should have dominion over
them in the morning. Hades even here is almost equivalent to the New
Testament gehenna.

[Isaiah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 5:15</span></span>

The prophet now repeats a thought which formed one of the refrains of
the second prophetic address ([Isa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md), [Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md), cf., [Isa
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017).md). It acquires here a still deeper
sense, from the context in which it stands. "Then are mean men bowed
down, and lords humbled, and the eyes of lofty men are humbled. And
Jehovah of hosts shows Himself exalted in judgment, and God the Holy One
sanctifies Himself in righteousness." That which had exalted itself from
earth to heaven, would be cast down earthwards into hell. The
consecutive futures depict the coming events, which are here represented
as historically present, as the direct sequel of what is also
represented as present in [Isa 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md) :
Hades opens, and then both low and lofty in Jerusalem sink down, and the
soaring eyes now wander about in horrible depths. God, who is both
exalted and holy in Himself, demanded that as the exalted One He should
be exalted, and that as the Holy One He should be sanctified. But
Jerusalem had not done that; He would therefore prove Himself the
exalted One by the execution of justice, and sanctify Himself (nikdash
is to be rendered as a reflective verb, according to [Eze
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023.md); [Eze
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#023).md) by the manifestation of
righteousness, in consequence of which the people of Jerusalem would
have to give Him glory against their will, as forming part of "the
things under the earth" ([Phi 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010).md).
Jerusalem has been swallowed up twice in this manner by Hades; once in
the Chaldean war, and again in the Roman. But the invisible background
of these outward events was the fact, that it had already fallen under
the power of hell. And now, even in a more literal sense, ancient
Jerusalem, like the company of Korah ([Num
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030.md), [Num
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#033).md), has gone underground. Just as
Babylon and Nineveh, the ruins of which are dug out of the inexhaustible
mine of their far-stretching foundation and soil, have sunk beneath the
ground; so do men walk about in modern Jerusalem over the ancient
Jerusalem, which lies buried beneath; and many an enigma of topography
will remain an enigma until ancient Jerusalem has been dug out of the
earth again.

[Isaiah 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 5:17</span></span>

And when we consider that the Holy Land is at the present time an
extensive pasture-ground for Arab shepherds, and that the modern
Jerusalem which has arisen from the dust is a Mohammedan city, we may
see in this also a literal fulfilment of [Isa
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md) : "And lambs feed as upon their
pasture, and nomad shepherds eat the waste places of the fat ones."
There is no necessity to supply an object to the verb ורעוּ, as Knobel
and others assume, viz., the waste lands mentioned in the second clause;
nor is Cedâbrâm to be taken as the object, as Caspari supposes; but the
place referred to is determined by the context: in the place where
Jerusalem is sunken, there lambs feed after the manner of their own
pasture-ground, i.e., just as if they were in their old accustomed
pasture (dober, as in [Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md), from
dâbar, to drive). The lambs intended are those of the gârim mentioned in
the second clause. The gârim themselves are men leading an unsettled,
nomad, or pilgrim life; as distinguished from gêrim, strangers visiting,
or even settled at a place. The lxx have ἄρνες, so that they must have
read either Cârim or gedâim, which Ewald, Knobel, and others adopt. But
one feature of the prophecy, which is sustained by the historical
fulfilment, is thereby obliterated. Chârboth mêchim are the lands of
those that were formerly marrowy, i.e., fat and strutting about in their
fulness; which lands had now become waste places. Knobel's statement,
that âcăl is out of place in connection with gârim, is overthrown by
[Isa 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007.md), to which he himself refers,
though he makes he-goats the subject instead of men. The second woe
closes with [Isa 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md). It is the
longest of all. This also serves to confirm the fact that luxury was the
leading vice of Judah in the time of Uzziah-Jotham, as it was that of
Israel under Jeroboam II (see [Amo
6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md), where the same threat is held
out).

[Isaiah 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 5:18</span></span>

The third woe is directed against the supposed strong-minded men, who
called down the judgment of God by presumptuous sins and wicked words.
"Woe unto them that draw crime with cords of lying, and sin as with the
rope of the waggon." Knobel and most other commentators take mâshak in
the sense of attrahere (to draw towards one's self): "They draw towards
them sinful deeds with cords of lying palliation, and the cart-rope of
the most daring presumption;" and cite, as parallel examples, [Job
40:24](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#024.md) and [Hos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004.md). But as mâshak is also used in
[Deu 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#003.md) in the sense of drawing in a
yoke, that is to say, drawing a plough or chariot; and as the waggon or
cart (agâlâh, the word commonly used for a transport-waggon, as
distinguished from mercâbâh, the state carriage or war chariot is
expressly mentioned here, the figure employed is certainly the same as
that which underlies the New Testament ἑτεροζυγεῖν ("unequally yoked,"
[Co2 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014).md). Iniquity was the burden
which they drew after them with cords of lying (shâv'h : see at [Psa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004.md) and [Job
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031).md), i.e., "want of character or
religion;" and sin was the waggon to which they were harnessed as if
with a thick cart-rope (Hofmann, Drechsler, and Caspari; see Ewald, 221,
a). Iniquity and sin are mentioned here as carrying with them their own
punishment. The definite העון (crime or misdeed) is generic, and the
indefinite הטּאה qualitative and massive. There is a bitter sarcasm
involved in the bold figure employed. They were proud of their unbelief;
but this unbelief was like a halter with which, like beasts of burden,
they were harnessed to sin, and therefore to the punishment of sin,
which they went on drawing further and further, in utter ignorance of
the waggon behind them.

[Isaiah 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 5:19</span></span>

[Isa 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md) shows very clearly that the
prophet referred to the free-thinkers of his time, the persons who are
called fools (nabal) and scorners (lētz) in the Psalms and Proverbs.
"Who say, Let Him hasten, accelerate His work, that we may see; and let
the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may
experience it." They doubted whether the day of Jehovah would ever come
([Eze 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022.md); [Jer
5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012).md), and went so far in their
unbelief as to call out for what they could not and would not believe,
and desired it to come that they might see it with their own eyes and
experience it for themselves ([Jer
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015.md); it is different in [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md) and Mal 2:17-3:1, where this
desire does not arise from scorn and defiance, but from impatience and
weakness of faith). As the two verbs denoting haste are used both
transitively and intransitively (vid., [Jdg
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#037), to hasten or make haste.md), we
might render the passage "let His work make haste," as Hitzig, Ewald,
Umbreit, and Drechsler do; but we prefer the rendering adopted by
Gesenius, Caspari, and Knobel, on the basis of [Isa
60:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#022.md), and take the verb as
transitive, and Jehovah as the subject. The forms yâchishâh and taboâh
are, with [Psa 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#004.md) and [Job
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#017.md), probably the only examples of
the expression of a wish in the third person, strengthened by the âh,
which indicates a summons or appeal; for [Eze
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#020), which Gesenius cites (48, 3.md),
and [Job 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021.md), to which Knobel
refers, have no connection with this, as in both passages the âh is the
feminine termination, and not hortative (vid., Comm. on Job, at [Job
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#017.md), note, and at [Job
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021).md). The fact that the
free-thinkers called God "the Holy One of Israel," whereas they scoffed
at His intended final and practical attestation of Himself as the Holy
One, may be explained from [Isa 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#011.md)
: they took this name of God from the lips of the prophet himself, so
that their scorn affected both God and His prophet at the same time.

[Isaiah 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 5:20</span></span>

The fourth woe: "Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who
give out darkness for light, and light for darkness; who give out bitter
for sweet, and sweet for bitter." The previous woe had reference to
those who made the facts of sacred history the butt of their
naturalistic doubt and ridicule, especially so far as they were the
subject of prophecy. This fourth woe relates to those who adopted a code
of morals that completely overturned the first principles of ethics, and
was utterly opposed to the law of God; for evil, darkness, and bitter,
with their respective antitheses, represent moral principles that are
essentially related ([Mat 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#023.md); [Jam
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#011).md), Evil, as hostile to God, is
dark in its nature, and therefore loves darkness, and is exposed to the
punitive power of darkness. And although it may be sweet to the material
taste, it is nevertheless bitter, inasmuch as it produces abhorrence and
disgust in the godlike nature of man, and, after a brief period of
self-deception, is turned into the bitter woe of fatal results. Darkness
and light, bitter and sweet, therefore, are not tautological metaphors
for evil and good; but epithets applied to evil and good according to
their essential principles, and their necessary and internal effects.

[Isaiah 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 5:21</span></span>

The fifth woe: "Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and
prudent in their own sight." The third woe had reference to the
unbelieving naturalists, the opponents of prophecy (nebuâh); the fourth
to the moralists, who threw all into confusion; and to this there is
appended, by a very natural association of ideas, the woe denounced upon
those whom want of humility rendered inaccessible to that wisdom which
went hand in hand with prophecy, and the true foundation of which was
the fear of Jehovah ([Pro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md); [Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md); [Ecc
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013).md). "Be not wise in thine own
eyes," is a fundamental rule of this wisdom ([Pro
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007).md). It was upon this wisdom that
that prophetic policy rested, whose warnings, as we read in [Isa
28:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009.md), they so scornfully rejected.
The next woe, which has reference to the administration of justice in
the state, shows very clearly that in this woe the prophet had more
especially the want of theocratic wisdom in relation to the affairs of
state in his mind.

[Isaiah 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 5:22</span></span>

The sixth woe: "Woe to those who are heroes to drink wine, and brave men
to mix strong drink; who acquit criminals for a bribe, and take away
from every one the righteousness of the righteous." We see from [Isa
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#023.md) that the drinkers in [Isa
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md) are unjust judges. The threat
denounced against these is Isaiah's universal ceterum censeo; and
accordingly it forms, in this instance also, the substance of his sixth
and last woe. They are heroes; not, however, in avenging wrong, but in
drinking wine; they are men of renown, though not for deciding between
guilt and innocence, but for mixing up the ingredients of strong
artistic wines. For the terms applied to such mixed wines, see [Psa
75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md); [Pro
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#030.md), [Sol
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003.md). It must be borne in mind,
however, that what is here called shecâr was not, properly speaking,
wine, but an artificial mixture, like date wine and cider. For such
things as these they were noteworthy and strong; whereas they judged
unjustly, and took bribes that they might consume the reward of their
injustice in drink and debauchery ([Isa
28:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md); [Pro
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#005).md). "For reward:" ēkeb (Arab. ‛ukb;
different from âkēb, a heel, = ‛akib) is an adverbial accusative, "in
recompense," or "for pay." "From him" (mimmennu) is distributive, and
refers back to tsaddikim (the righteous); as, for example, in [Hos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md).

[Isaiah 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 5:24</span></span>

In the three exclamations in [Isa
5:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018.md), Jehovah rested contented with
the simple undeveloped "woe" (hoi). On the other hand, the first two
utterances respecting the covetous and the debauchees were expanded into
an elaborate denunciation of punishment. But now that the prophet has
come to the unjust judges, the denunciation of punishment bursts out
with such violence, that a return to the simple exclamation of "woe" is
not to be thought of. The two "therefores" in [Isa
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md), [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md), a third is now added in [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md) : "Therefore, as the tongue of
fire devours stubble, and hay sinks together in the flame, their root
will become like mould, and their blossom fly up like dust; for they
have despised the law of Jehovah of hosts, and scornfully rejected the
proclamation of the Holy One of Israel." The persons primarily intended
as those described in [Isa 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md), [Isa
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#023.md), but with a further extension of
the range of vision to Judah and Jerusalem, the vineyard of which they
are the bad fruit. The sinners are compared to a plant which moulders
into dust both above and below, i.e., altogether (cf., [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md), and the expression, "Let there be
to him neither root below nor branch above," in the inscription upon the
sarcophagus of the Phoenician king Es'mun'azar). Their root moulders in
the earth, and their blossom (perach, as in [Isa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005).md) turns to fine dust, which the
wind carries away. And this change in root and blossom takes place
suddenly, as if through the force of fire. In the expression Ce'ecol
kash leshon 'ēsh ("as the tongue of fire devours stubble"), which
consists of four short words with three sibilant letters, we hear, as it
were, the hissing of the flame. When the infinitive construct is
connected with both subject and object, the subject generally stands
first, as in [Isa 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md); but here the
object is placed first, as in [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001) (Ges. 133, 3; Ewald, 307.md). In the
second clause, the infinitive construct passes over into the finite
verb, just as in the similarly constructed passage in [Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md). As yirpeh has the intransitive
meaning Collabi, to sink together, or collapse; either lehâbâh must be
an acc. loci, or Chashash lehâbâh the construct state, signifying
flame-hay, i.e., hay destined to the flame, or ascending in flame.

(Note: In Arabic also, Chashı̄sh signifies hay; but in common usage (at
least in Syriac) it is applied not to dried grass, but to green grass or
barley: hence the expression yachush there is green fodder. Here,
however, in Isaiah, Chashash is equivalent to Chashish yâbis, and this
is its true etymological meaning (see the Lexicons). But kash is still
used in Syro-Arabic, to signify not stubble, but wheat that has been cut
and is not yet threshed; whereas the radical word itself signifies to be
dry, and Châshash consequently is used for mown grass, and kash for the
dry halm of wheat, whether as stubble left standing in the ground, or as
straw (vid., Comm. on Job, at [Job
39:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#013))..md)

As the reason for the sudden dissolution of the plantation of Judah,
instead of certain definite sins being mentioned, the sin of all sins is
given at once, namely, the rejection of the word of God with the heart
(mâ'as), and in word and deed (ni'ēts). The double 'ēth (with yethib
immediately before pashta, as in eleven passages in all; see
Heidenheim's Imspete hate'amim, p. 20) and v'êth (with tebir) give
prominence to the object; and the interchange of Jehovah of hosts with
the Holy One of Israel makes the sin appear all the greater on account
of the exaltation and holiness of God, who revealed Himself in this
word, and indeed had manifested Himself to Israel as His own peculiar
people. The prophet no sooner mentions the great sin of Judah, than the
announcement of punishment receives, as it were, fresh fuel, and bursts
out again.

[Isaiah 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 5:25</span></span>

"Therefore is the wrath of Jehovah kindled against His people, and He
stretches His hand over them, and smites them; then the hills tremble,
and their carcases become like sweepings in the midst of the streets.
For all this His anger is not appeased, and His hand is stretched out
still." We may see from these last words, which are repeated as a
refrain in the cycle of prophecies relating to the time of Ahaz ([Isa
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#011.md), [Isa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#016.md); [Isa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004).md), that the prophet had before his
mind a distinct and complete judgment upon Judah, belonging to the
immediate future. It was certainly a coming judgment, not one already
past; for the verbs after "therefore" (‛al-cên), like those after the
three previous lâcēn, are all prophetic preterites. It is impossible,
therefore, to take the words "and the hills tremble" as referring to the
earthquake in the time of Uzziah ([Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005).md). This judgment, which was closer
at hand, would consist in the fact that Jehovah would stretch out His
hand in His wrath over His people (or, as it is expressed elsewhere,
would swing His hand: Luther, "wave His hand," i.e., move it to and fro;
vid., [Isa 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md); [Isa
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#016.md); [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md), [Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032).md), and bring it down upon Judah
with one stroke, the violence of which would be felt not only by men,
but by surrounding nature as well. What kind of stroke this would be,
was to be inferred from the circumstance that the corpses would lie
unburied in the streets, like common street-sweepings. The reading
תּצּות must be rejected. Early editors read the word much more correctly
תּצּות; Buxtorf (1618) even adopts the reading תוּצות, which has the
Masoretic pointing in [Num 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#039.md) in
its favour. It is very natural to connect Cassuchâh with the Arabic
kusâcha (sweepings; see at [Isa
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#012).md): but kusâc is the common form
for waste or rubbish of this kind (e.g., kulâm, nail-cuttings), whereas
Cassuach is a form which, like the forms fâōl (e.g., Châmōts) and fâūl
(compare the Arabic fâsūs, a wind-maker, or wind-bag, i.e., a boaster),
has always an intensive, active (e.g., Channun), or circumstantial
signification (like shaccul), but is never found in a passive sense. The
Caph is consequently to be taken as a particle of comparison (followed,
as is generally the case, with a definite article); and sūchâh is to be
derived from sūach (= verrere, to sweep). The reference, therefore, is
not to a pestilence (which is designated, as a stroke from God, not by
hiccâh, but by nâgaph ), but to the slaughter of battle; and if we look
at the other terrible judgment threatened in [Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md)., which was to proceed from the
imperial power, there can be no doubt that the spirit of prophecy here
points to the massacre that took place in Judah in connection with the
Syro-Ephraimitish war (see [Ch2
28:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005).md). The mountains may then have
trembled with the marching of troops, and the din of arms, and the
felling of trees, and the shout of war. At any rate, nature had to
participate in what men had brought upon themselves; for, according to
the creative appointment of God, nature bears the same relation to man
as the body to the soul. Every stroke of divine wrath which falls upon a
nation equally affects the land which has grown up, as it were, with it;
and in this sense the mountains of Judah trembled at the time referred
to, even though the trembling was only discernible by initiated ears.
But "for all this" (Beth, = "notwithstanding," "in spite of," as in [Job
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#022).md) the wrath of Jehovah, as the
prophet foresaw, would not turn away, as it was accustomed to do when He
was satisfied; and His hand would still remain stretched out over Judah,
ready to strike again.

[Isaiah 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 5:26</span></span>

Jehovah finds the human instruments of His further strokes, not in
Israel and the neighbouring nations, but in the people of distant lands.
"And lifts up a banner to the distant nations, and hisses to it from the
end of the earth; and, behold, it comes with haste swiftly." What the
prophet here foretold began to be fulfilled in the time of Ahaz. But the
prophecy, which commences with this verse, has every possible mark of
the very opposite of a vaticinium post eventum. It is, strictly
speaking, only what had already been threatened in [Deu
28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md). (cf., [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021)..md), though here it assumes a more
plastic form, and is here presented for the first time to the view of
the prophet as though coming out of a mist. Jehovah summons the nations
afar off: haggōyim mērâchok signifies, as we have rendered it, the
"distant nations," for mērâc is virtually an adjective both here and
[Isa 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md), just as in [Jer
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#023.md) it is virtually a substantive.
The visible working of Jehovah presents itself to the prophet in two
figures. Jehovah plants a banner or standard, which, like an optical
telegraph, announces to the nations at a more remote distance than the
horn of battle (shophâr) could possibly reach, that they are to gather
together to war. A "banner" (nês): i.e., a lofty staff with flying
colours ([Isa 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023).md) planted upon a
bare mountain-top ([Isa 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002).md). נשׂא
alternates with הרים in this favourite figure of Isaiah. The nations
through whom this was primarily fulfilled were the nations of the
Assyrian empire. According to the Old Testament view, these nations were
regarded as far off, and dwelling at the end of the earth ([Isa
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#003).md), not only inasmuch as the
Euphrates formed the boundary towards the north-east between what was
geographically known and unknown to the Israelites ([Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md); [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010).md), but also inasmuch as the
prophet had in his mind a complex body of nations stretching far away
into further Asia. The second figure is taken from a bee-master, who
entices the bees, by hissing or whistling, to come out of their hives
and settle on the ground. Thus Virgil says to the bee-master who wants
to make the bees settle, "Raise a ringing, and beat the cymbals of
Cybele all around" (Georgics, iv 54). Thus does Jehovah entice the hosts
of nations like swarms of bees ([Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018).md), and they swarm together with
haste and swiftness. The plural changes into the singular, because those
who are approaching have all the appearance at first of a compact and
indivisible mass; it is also possible that the ruling nation among the
many is singled out. The thought and expression are both misty, and this
is perfectly characteristic. With the word "behold" (hinnēh) the prophet
points to them; they are approaching mehērâh kal, i.e., in the shortest
time with swift feet, and the nearer they come to his view the more
clearly he can describe them.

[Isaiah 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 5:27</span></span>

"There is none exhausted, and none stumbling among them: it gives itself
no slumber, and no sleep; and to none is the girdle of his hips loosed;
and to none is the lace of his shoes broken." Notwithstanding the long
march, there is no exhausted one, obliged to separate himself and remain
behind ([Deu 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#018.md); [Isa
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031)); no stumbling one (Cōshēl.md), for
they march on, pressing incessantly forwards, as if along a well-made
road ([Jer 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009).md). They do not slumber
(nūm), to say nothing of sleeping (yâshēn), so great is their eagerness
for battle: i.e., they do not slumber to refresh themselves, and do not
even allow themselves their ordinary night's rest. No one has the girdle
of his armour-shirt or coat of mail, in which he stuck his sword ([Neh
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#018).md), at all loosened; nor has a
single one even the shoe-string, with which his sandals were fastened,
broken (nittak, disrumpitur). The statement as to their want of rest
forms a climax descendens; the other, as to the tightness and durability
of their equipment, a climax ascendens: the two statements follow one
another after the nature of a chiasmus.

[Isaiah 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 5:28</span></span>

The prophet then proceeds to describe their weapons and war-chariots.
"He whose arrows are sharpened, and all his bows strung; the hoofs of
his horses are counted like flint, and his wheels like the whirlwind."
In the prophet's view they are coming nearer and nearer. For he sees
that they have brought the sharpened arrows in their quivers ([Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006).md); and the fact that all their
bows are already trodden (namely, as their length was equal to a man's
height, by treading upon the string with the left foot, as we may learn
from Arrian's Indica), proves that they are near to the goal. The
correct reading in Jablonsky (according to Kimchi's Lex. cf., Michlal
yofi) is קשּׁתתיו with dagesh dirimens, as in [Psa
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#015) (Ges. 20, 2, b.md). As the custom
of shoeing horses was not practised in ancient times, firm hoofs (ὃπλαι
καρτεραί, according to Xenophon's Hippikos) were one of the most
important points in a good horse. And the horses of the enemy that was
now drawing near to Judah had hoofs that would be found like flint
(tzar, only used here, equivalent to the Arabic zirr). Homer designates
such horses Chalkopodes, brazen-footed. And the two wheels of the
war-chariots, to which they were harnessed, turned with such velocity,
and overthrew everything before them with such violence, that it seemed
not merely as if a whirlwind drove them forward, but as if they were the
whirlwind itself ([Isa 66:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015.md); [Jer
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013).md). Nahum compares them to
lightning ([Isa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#005).md). Thus far the
prophet's description has moved on, as if by forced marches, in clauses
of from two to four words each. It now changes into a heavy, stealthy
pace, and then in a few clauses springs like a wild beast upon its prey.

[Isaiah 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 5:29</span></span>

"Roaring issues from it as from the lioness: it roars like lions, and
utters a low murmur; seizes the prey, carries it off, and no one
rescues." The futures, with the preceding לו שׁאגה which is equivalent
to a future, hold each feature in the description fast, as if for
prolonged contemplation. The lion roars when eager for prey; and such is
now the war-cry of the bloodthirsty enemy, which the prophet compares to
the roaring of a lion or of young lions (Cephirim) in the fulness of
their strength. (The lion is described by its poetic name, לביא; this
does not exactly apply to the lioness, which would rather be designated
by the term לביּה.) The roar is succeeded by a low growl (nâham,
fremere), when a lion is preparing to fall upon its prey.

(Note: In Arabic, en-nehem is used to signify greediness (see Ali's
Proverbs, No. 16).)

And so the prophet hears a low and ominous murmur in the army, which is
now ready for battle. But he also sees immediately afterwards how the
enemy seizes its booty and carries it irrecoverably away: literally,
"how he causes it to escape," i.e., not "lets it slip in cruel sport,"
as Luzzatto interprets it, but carries it to a place of safety ([Mic
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014).md). The prey referred to is Judah.
It also adds to the gloomy and mysterious character of the prophecy,
that the prophet never mentions Judah. In the following v. also ([Isa
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#030).md) the object is still suppressed,
as if the prophet could not let it pass his lips.

[Isaiah 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 5:30</span></span>

"And it utters a deep roar over it in that day like the roaring of the
sea: and it looks to the earth, and behold darkness, tribulation, and
light; it becomes night over it in the clouds of heaven." The subject to
"roars" is the mass of the enemy; and in the expressions "over it" and
"it looks" (nibbat; the niphal, which is only met with here, in the
place of the hiphil) the prophet has in his mind the nation of Judah,
upon which the enemy falls with the roar of the ocean - that is to say,
overwhelming it like a sea. And when the people of Judah look to the
earth, i.e., to their own land, darkness alone presents itself, and
darkness which has swallowed up all the smiling and joyous aspect which
it had before. And what then? The following words, tzar vâ'ōr, have been
variously rendered, viz., "moon (= sahar) and sun" by the Jewish
expositors, "stone and flash," i.e., hail and thunder-storm, by
Drechsler; but such renderings as these, and others of a similar kind,
are too far removed from the ordinary usage of the language. And the
separation of the two words, so that the one closes a sentence and the
other commences a fresh one (e.g., "darkness of tribulation, and the sun
becomes dark"), which is adopted by Hitzig, Gesenius, Ewald, and others,
is opposed to the impression made by the two monosyllables, and
sustained by the pointing, that they are connected together. The
simplest explanation is one which takes the word tzar in its ordinary
sense of tribulation or oppression, and 'ōr in its ordinary sense of
light, and which connects the two words closely together. And this is
the case with the rendering given above: tzar vâ'ōr are "tribulation and
brightening up," one following the other and passing over into the
other, like morning and night ([Isa
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#012).md). This pair of words forms an
interjectional clause, the meaning of which is, that when the predicted
darkness had settled upon the land of Judah, this would not be the end;
but there would still follow an alternation of anxiety and glimmerings
of hope, until at last it had become altogether dark in the cloudy sky
over all the land of Judah (‛ariphim, the cloudy sky, is only met with
here; it is derived from âraph, to drop or trickle, hence also arâphel:
the suffix points back to lâ'âretz, eretz denoting sometimes the earth
as a whole, and at other times the land as being part of the earth). The
prophet here predicts that, before utter ruin has overtaken Judah,
sundry approaches will be made towards this, within which a divine
deliverance will appear again and again. Grace tries and tries again and
again, until at last the measure of iniquity is full, and the time of
repentance past. The history of the nation of Judah proceeded according
to this law until the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. The
Assyrian troubles, and the miraculous light of divine help which arose
in the destruction of the military power of Sennacherib, were only the
foreground of this mournful but yet ever and anon hopeful course of
history, which terminated in utter darkness, that has continued now for
nearly two thousand years.

This closes the third prophetic address. It commences with a parable
which contains the history of Israel in nuce, and closes with an emblem
which symbolizes the gradual but yet certain accomplishment of the
judicial, penal termination of the parable. This third address,
therefore, is as complete in itself as the second was. The kindred
allusions are to be accounted for from the sameness of the historical
basis and arena. During the course of the exposition, it has become more
and more evident and certain that it relates to the time of Uzziah and
Jotham - a time of peace, of strength, and wealth, but also of pride and
luxury. The terrible slaughter of the Syro-Ephraimitish war, which broke
out at the end of Jotham's reign, and the varied complications which
king Ahaz introduced between Judah and the imperial worldly power, and
which issued eventually in the destruction of the former kingdom - those
five marked epochs in the history of the kingdoms of the world, or great
empires, to which the Syro-Ephraimitish war was the prelude - were still
hidden from the prophet in the womb of the future. The description of
the great mass of people that was about to roll over Judah from afar is
couched in such general terms, so undefined and misty, that all we can
say is, that everything that was to happen to the people of God on the
part of the imperial power during the five great and extended periods of
judgment that were now so soon to commence (viz., the Assyrian, the
Chaldean, the Persian, the Grecian, and the Roman), was here unfolding
itself out of the mist of futurity, and presenting itself to the
prophet's eye. Even in the time of Ahaz the character of the prophecy
changed in this respect. It was then that the eventful relation, in
which Israel stood to the imperial power, generally assumed its first
concrete shape in the form of a distinct relation to Asshur (Assyria).
And from that time forth the imperial power in the mouth of the prophet
is no longer a majestic thing without a name; but although the notion of
the imperial power was not yet embodied in Asshur, it was called Asshur,
and Asshur stood as its representative. It also necessarily follows from
this, that Chapters 2-4 and 5 belong to the times anterior to Ahaz,
i.e., to those of Uzziah and Jotham. But several different questions
suggest themselves here. If chapters 2-4 and 5 were uttered under Uzziah
and Jotham, how could Isaiah begin with a promise ([Isa
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001).md) which is repeated word for word
in [Mic 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)., where it is the direct
antithesis to [Isa 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012.md), which was
uttered by Micah, according to [Jer
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018.md), in the time of Hezekiah? Again,
if we consider the advance apparent in the predictions of judgment from
the general expressions with which they commence in Chapter 1 to the
close of chapter 5, in what relation does the address in chapter 1 stand
to chapters 2-4 and 5, inasmuch as [Isa
5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md) are not ideal (as we felt
obliged to maintain, in opposition to Caspari), but have a distinct
historical reference, and therefore at any rate presuppose the
Syro-Ephraimitish war? And lastly, if [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) does really relate, as it
apparently does, to the call of Isaiah to the prophetic office, how are
we to explain the singular fact, that three prophetic addresses precede
the history of his call, which ought properly to stand at the
commencement of the book? Drechsler and Caspari have answered this
question lately, by maintaining that [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) does not contain an account of
the call of Isaiah to the prophetic office, but simply of the call of
the prophet, who was already installed in that office, to one particular
mission. The proper heading to be adopted for [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) would therefore be, "The
ordination of the prophet as the preacher of the judgment of hardening;"
and chapters 1-5 would contain warning reproofs addressed by the prophet
to the people, who were fast ripening for this judgment of hardening
(reprobation), for the purpose of calling them to repentance. The final
decision was still trembling in the balance. But the call to repentance
was fruitless, and Israel hardened itself. And now that the goodness of
God had tried in vain to lead the people to repentance, and the
long-suffering of God had been wantonly abused by the people, Jehovah
Himself would harden them. Looked at in this light, [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) stands in its true historical
place. It contains the divine sequel to that portion of Isaiah's
preaching, and of the prophetic preaching generally, by which it had
been preceded. But true as it is that the whole of the central portion
of Israel's history, which lay midway between the commencement and the
close, was divided in half by the contents of [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md), and that the distinctive
importance of Isaiah as a prophet arose especially from the fact that he
stood upon the boundary between these two historic halves; there are
serious objections which present themselves to such an explanation of
[Isa 6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md). It is possible, indeed,
that this distinctive importance may have been given to Isaiah's
official position at his very first call. And what Umbreit says -
namely, that [Isa 6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) must make the
impression upon every unprejudiced mind, that it relates to the
prophet's inaugural vision - cannot really be denied. but the position
in which [Isa 6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) stands in the
book itself must necessarily produce a contrary impression, unless it
can be accounted for in some other way. Nevertheless the impression
still remains (just as at [Isa 1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007).md),
and recurs again and again. We will therefore proceed to [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) without attempting to efface
it. It is possible that we may discover some other satisfactory
explanation of the enigmatical position of [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) in relation to what precedes.
