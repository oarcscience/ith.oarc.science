Mustering of Israel in the Steppes of Moab - Numbers 26

Before taking vengeance upon the Midianites, as they had been commanded,
the Israelites were to be mustered as the army of Jehovah, by means of a
fresh numbering, since the generation that was mustered at Sinai (ch.
1-4) had died out in the wilderness, with the sole exception of Caleb
and Joshua ([Num 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064.md), [Num
26:65](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#065).md). On this ground the command of
God was issued, "after the plague,"' for a fresh census and muster. For
with the plague the last of those who came out of Egypt, and were not to
enter Canaan, had been swept away, and thus the sentence had been
completely executed. - The object of the fresh numbering, however, was
not merely to muster Israel for the war with the Midianites, and in the
approaching conquest of the promised land with the Canaanites also, but
was intended to serve at the same time as a preparation for their
settlement in Canaan, viz., for the division of the conquered land among
the tribes and families of Israel. For this reason (Num 26) the families
of the different tribes are enumerated here, which was not the case in
ch. 1; and generally instructions are also given in [Num
1:52](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#052.md) -56, with reference to the
division of Canaan. - The numbering was simply extended, as before, to
the male population of the age of 20 years and upwards, and was no doubt
carried out, like the previous census at Sinai, by Moses and the high
priest (Eleazar), with the assistance of the heads of the tribes,
although the latter are not expressly mentioned here. - The names of the
families correspond, - with very few exceptions, - to the grandsons and
great-grandsons of Jacob mentioned in Gen 46. - With regard to the total
number of the people, and the number of the different tribes.

[Numbers 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 26:1</span></span>

Mustering of the Twelve Tribes. - [Num
26:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001.md). The command of God to Moses
and Eleazar is the same as in Num 1, 2, and 3, except that it does not
enter so much into details.

[Num 26:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#003.md)

"And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them" (דּבּר with the
accusative, as in [Gen 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#004).md). The
pronoun refers to "the children of Israel," or more correctly, to the
heads of the nation as the representatives of the congregation, who were
to carry out the numbering. On the Arboth-Moab, see at [Num
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001.md). Only the leading point in their
words is mentioned, viz., "from twenty years old and upwards" (sc.,
shall ye take the number of the children of Israel), since it was very
simple to supply the words "take the sum" from [Num
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#002.md).

(Note: This is, at all events, easier and simpler than the alterations
of the text which have been suggested for the purpose of removing the
difficulty. Knobel proposes to alter וידבּר into ויּדבּר, and לאמר into
לפקד: "Moses and Eleazar arranged the children of Israel when they
mustered them." But הדבּיר does not mean to arrange, but simply to drive
in pairs, to subjugate ([Psa 18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048.md),
and [Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004).md), - an expression which,
as much be immediately apparent, is altogether inapplicable to the
arrangement of the people in families for the purpose of taking a
census.),

\- The words from "the children of Israel" in [Num
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#004.md) onwards form the introduction to
the enumeration of the different tribes ([Num
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005).), and the verb יהיוּ (were.md) must
be supplied. "And the children of Israel, who went forth out of Egypt,
were Reuben," etc.

[Num 26:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005.md)

The families of Reuben tally with [Gen
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#009.md); [Exo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014.md), and [Ch1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#003). The plural בּני (sons.md), in [Num
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#008.md), where only one son is mentioned,
is to be explained from the fact, that several sons of this particular
son (i.e., grandsons) are mentioned afterwards. On Dathan and Abiram,
see at [Num 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001.md) and [Num
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#032.md). See also the remark made here
in [Num 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010.md) and [Num
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011.md), viz., that those who were
destroyed with the company of Korah were for a sign (נס, here a
warning); but that the sons of Korah were not destroyed along with their
father.

[Num 26:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012.md)

The Simeonites counted only five families, as Ohad ([Gen
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#010).md) left no family. Nemuel is
called Jemuel there, as yod and nun are often interchanged (cf. Ges.
thes. pp. 833 and 557); and Zerach is another name of the same
signification for Zohar (Zerach, the rising of the sun; Zohar, candor,
splendour).

[Num 26:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#015.md)

The Gadites are the same as in [Gen
46:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#016.md), except that Ozni is called
Ezbon there.

[Num 26:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#019.md)

The sons and families of Judah agree with [Gen
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012.md) (cf. [Gen
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#006)..md); also with [Ch1
2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003.md).

[Num 26:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#023.md)

The families of Issachar correspond to the sons mentioned in [Gen
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#013.md), except that the name Job occurs
there instead of Jashub. The two names have the same signification, as
Job is derived from an Arabic word which signifies to return.

[Num 26:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#026.md)

The families of Zebulun correspond to the sons named in [Gen
46:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#014.md).

[Num 26:28-37](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#028.md)

The descendants of Joseph were classified in two leading families,
according to his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim, who were born before the
removal of Israel to Egypt, and were raised into founders of tribes in
consequence of the patriarch Israel having adopted them as his own sons
(Gen 48).

[Num 26:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029.md)

Eight families descended from Manasseh: viz., one from his son Machir,
the second from Machir's son or Manasseh's grandson Gilead, and the
other six from the six sons of Gilead. The genealogical accounts in [Num
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md); [Num
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md), and [Jos
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md)., fully harmonize with this,
except that Iezer ([Num 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030).md) is
called Abiezer in [Jos 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#002.md); whereas
only a part of the names mentioned here occur in the genealogical
fragments in [Ch1 2:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021.md), and
7:14-29. In [Num 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#033.md), a son of
Hepher, named Zelophehad, is mentioned. He had no sons, but only
daughters, whose names are given here to prepare the way for the legal
regulations mentioned in Num 27 and 39, to which this fact gave rise.

[Num 26:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#035.md)

There were four families descended from Ephraim; three from his sons,
and one from his grandson. Of the descendants of Sutelah several links
are given in [Ch1 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md).

[Num 26:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038.md)

The children of Benjamin formed seven families, five of whom were
founded by his sons, and two by grandsons. (On the differences which
occur between the names given here and those in [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021)..md) Some of the sons and grandsons
of Benjamin mentioned here are also found in the genealogical fragments
in [Ch1 7:6-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md), and [Ch1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md).

[Num 26:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#042.md)

The descendants of Dan formed only one family, named from a son of Dan,
who is called Shuham here, but Hushim in [Gen
46:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#023.md); though this family no doubt
branched out into several smaller families, which are not named here,
simply because this list contains only the leading families into which
the tribes were divided.

[Num 26:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#044.md)

The families of Asher agree with the sons of Asher mentioned in [Gen
46:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#017.md) and [Ch1
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#030.md), except that Ishuah is omitted
here, because he founded no family.

[Num 26:48-50](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#048.md)

The families of Naphtali tally with the sons of Naphtali in [Gen
46:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#024.md) and [Ch1
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#030.md).

[Num 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#051.md)

The total number of the persons mustered was 601,730.

[Numbers 26:52](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">num 26:52</span></span>

Instructions concerning the Distribution of the Land. - In [Num
26:53](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#053.md), [Num
26:54](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#054.md), the command is given to
distribute the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes ("unto
these"), according to the number of the names (Num 1:2-18), i.e., to the
tribes and families that contained only a few persons, they were to make
it small; to every one according to the measure of its mustered persons
(ל must be repeated before אישׁ). In [Num
26:55](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#055.md), [Num
26:56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#056.md), it is still further commanded
that the distribution should take place by lot. "According to the names
on their paternal tribes shall they (the children of Israel) receive it
(the land) for an inheritance." The meaning of these words can only be,
that every tribe was to receive a province of its own for an
inheritance, which should be called by its name for ever. The other
regulation in [Num 26:56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#056.md), "according
to the measure of the lot shall its inheritance (the inheritance of
every tribe) be divided between the numerous and the small (tribe)," is
no doubt to be understood as signifying, that in the division of the
tribe territories, according to the comparative sizes of the different
tribes, they were to adhere to that portion of land which fell to every
tribe in the casting of the lots. The magnitude and limits of the
possessions of the different tribes could not be determined by the lot
according to the magnitude of the tribes themselves: all that could
possibly be determined was the situation to be occupied by the tribe; so
that R. Bechai is quite correct in observing that "the casting of the
lot took place for the more convenient distribution of the different
portions, whether of better or inferior condition, that there might be
no occasion for strife and covetousness," though the motive assigned is
too partial in its character. The lot was to determine the portion of
every tribe, not merely to prevent all occasion for dissatisfaction and
complaining, but in order that every tribe might receive with gratitude
the possession that fell to its lot as the inheritance assigned it by
God, the result of the lot being regarded by almost all nations as
determined by God Himself (cf. [Pro
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033.md); [Pro
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018).md). On this ground not only was
the lot resorted to by the Greeks and Romans in the distribution of
conquered lands (see the proofs in Clericus, Rosenmller, and Knobel),
but it is still employed in the division of lands. (For further remarks,
see at [Jos 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001)..md).

[Numbers 26:57](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">num 26:57</span></span>

Mustering of the Levites. - The enumeration of the different Levitical
families into which the three leading families of Levi, that were
founded by his three sons Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, were divided, is
not complete, but is broken off in [Num
26:58](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#058.md) after the notice of five
different families, for the purpose of tracing once more the descent of
Moses and Aaron, the heads not of this tribe only, but of the whole
nation, and also of giving the names of the sons of the latter ([Num
26:59-61](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#059).md). And after this the whole is
concluded with a notice of the total number of those who were mustered
of the tribe of Levi ([Num 26:62](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#062).md). -
Of the different families mentioned, Libni belonged to Gershon (cf. [Num
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#021).md), Hebroni to Kohath ([Num
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027).md), Machli and Mushi to Merari
([Num 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#033).md), and Korchi, i.e., the
family of Korah (according to ch. [Num
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001.md); cf. [Exo
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#021.md) and [Exo
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#024).md), to Kohath. Moses and Aaron were
descendants of Kohath (see at [Exo
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020.md) and [Exo
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#001).md). Some difficulty is caused by the
relative clause, "whom (one) had born to Levi in Egypt" ([Num
26:59](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#059).md), on account of the subject
being left indefinite. It cannot be Levi's wife, as Jarchi, Abenezra,
and others suppose; for Jochebed, the mother of Moses, was not a
daughter of Levi in the strict sense of the word, but only a Levitess or
descendant of Levi, who lived about 300 years after Levi; just as her
husband Amram was not actually the son of Amram, who bore that name
([Exo 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018).md), but a later descendant of
this older Amram. The missing subject must be derived from the verb
itself, viz., either היּלדת or אמּהּ (her mother), as in [Kg1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#006.md), another passage in which "his
mother" is to be supplied (cf. Ewald, 294, b.).

[Numbers 26:60](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">num 26:60</span></span>

Sons of Aaron: cf. [Num 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#002.md) and [Num
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#004.md); [Exo
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md); [Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md), [Lev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002.md).

[Numbers 26:62](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">num 26:62</span></span>

The Levites were not mustered along with the rest of the tribes of
Israel, because the mustering took place with especial reference to the
conquest of Canaan, and the Levites were not to receive any territory as
a tribe (see at [Num 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020).md).

[Numbers 26:63](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">num 26:63</span></span>

Concluding formula with the remark in [Num
26:65](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#065.md), that the penal sentence which
God had pronounced in [Num 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029.md) and
[Num 14:38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#038.md) upon the generation which
came out of Egypt, had been completely carried out.
