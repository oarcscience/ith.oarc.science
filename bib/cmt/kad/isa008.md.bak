### [Isaiah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 8:1</span></span>

In the midst of the Syro-Ephraimitish war, which was not yet at an end,
Isaiah received instructions from God to perform a singular prophetic
action. "Then Jehovah said to me, Take a large slab, and write upon it
with common strokes, 'In Speed Spoil, Booty hastens;' and I will take to
me trustworthy witnesses, Uriyah the priest, and Zecharyahu the son of
Yeberechyahu." The slab or table (cf., [Isa
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#023.md), where the same word is used to
signify a metal mirror) was to be large, to produce the impression of a
monument; and the writing upon it was to be "a man's pen" (Cheret
'enōsh), i.e., written in the vulgar, and, so to speak, popular
character, consisting of inartistic strokes that could be easily read
(vid., [Rev 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018.md); [Rev
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#017).md). Philip d'Aquin, in his
Lexicon, adopts the explanation, "Enosh-writing, i.e., hieroglyphic
writing, so called because it was first introduced in the time of
Enosh." Luzzatto renders it, a lettere cubitali; but the reading for
this would be b'cheret ammath 'ish. The only true rendering is stylo
vulgari (see Ges. Thes. s.v. 'enosh). The words to be written are
introduced with Lamed, to indicate dedication (as in [Eze
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016).md), or the object to which the
inscription was dedicated or applied, as if it read, "A table devoted to
'Spoil very quickly, booty hastens;' " unless, indeed, l'mahēr is to be
taken as a fut. instans, as it is by Luzzatto - after [Gen
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012.md); [Jos
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#005.md); [Hab
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017.md) - in the sense of acceleratura
sunt spolia, or (what the position of the words might more naturally
suggest) with mahēr in a transitive sense, as in the construction לבערּ
היה, and others, accelerationi spolia, i.e., they are ready for
hastening. Most of the commentators have confused the matter here by
taking the words as a proper name (Ewald, 288, c), which they were not
at first, though they became so afterwards. At first they were an
oracular announcement of the immediate future, accelerant spolia,
festinat praeda (spoil is quick, booty hastens). Spoil; booty; but who
would the vanquished be? Jehovah knew, and His prophet knew, although
not initiated into the policy of Ahaz. But their knowledge was
studiously veiled in enigmas. For the writing was not to disclose
anything to the people. It was simply to serve as a public record of the
fact, that the course of events was one that Jehovah had foreseen and
indicated beforehand. And when what was written upon the table should
afterwards take place, they would know that it was the fulfilment of
what had already been written, and therefore was an event pre-determined
by God. For this reason Jehovah took to Himself witnesses. There is no
necessity to read ואעידה (and I had it witnessed), as Knobel and others
do; nor והעידה (and have it witnessed), as the Sept., Targum, Syriac,
and Hitzig do. Jehovah said what He would do; and the prophet knew,
without requiring to be told, that it was to be accomplished
instrumentally through him. Uriah was no doubt the priest (Urijah), who
afterwards placed himself at the service of Ahaz to gratify his
heathenish desires ([Kg2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010)..md).
Zechariah ben Yeberechyahu (Berechiah) was of course not the prophet of
the times after the captivity, but possibly the Asaphite mentioned in
[Ch2 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#013.md). He is not further known to
us. In good editions, ben is not followed by makkeph, but marked with
mercha, according to the Masora at [Gen
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#019.md). These two men were reliable
witnesses, being persons of great distinction, and their testimony would
weigh with the people. When the time should arrive that the history of
their own times solved the riddle of this inscription, these two men
were to tell the people how long ago the prophet had written that down
in his prophetic capacity.

[Isaiah 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 8:3</span></span>

But something occurred in the meantime whereby the place of the lifeless
table was taken by a more eloquent and living one. "And I drew near to
the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son: and Jehovah said to
me, Call his name In-speed-spoil-booty-hastens (Maher-shalal-hash-baz):
for before the boy shall know how to cry, My father, and my mother, they
will carry away the riches of Damascus, and the spoil of Samaria, before
the king of Asshur." To his son Shear-yashub, in whose name the law of
the history of Israel, as revealed to the prophet on the occasion of his
call ([Isa 6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md), viz., the
restoration of only a remnant of the whole nation, had been formulated,
there was now added a second son, to whom the inscription upon the table
was given as a name (with a small abbreviation, and if the Lamed is the
particle of dedication, a necessary one). He was therefore the symbol of
the approaching chastisement of Syria and the kingdom of the ten tribes.
Before the boy had learned to stammer out the name of father and mother,
they would carry away (yissâ, not the third pers. fut. niphal, which is
yinnâsē, but kal with a latent, indefinite subject hannōsē': Ges. 137,
3) the treasures of Damascus and the trophies (i.e., the spoil taken
from the flying or murdered foe) of Samaria before the king of Asshur,
who would therefore leave the territory of the two capitals as a
conqueror. It is true that Tiglath-pileser only conquered Damascus, and
not Samaria; but he took from Pekah, the king of Samaria, the land
beyond the Jordan, and a portion of the land on this side. The trophies,
which he took thence to Assyria, were no less the spoil of Samaria than
if he had conquered Samaria itself (which Shalmanassar did twenty years
afterwards). The birth of Mahershalal took place about three-quarters of
a year later than the preparation of the table (as the verb vâ'ekrab is
an aorist and not a pluperfect); and the time appointed, from the birth
of the boy till the chastisement of the allied kingdoms, was about a
year. Now, as the Syro-Ephraimitish war did not commence later than the
first year of the reign of Ahaz, i.e., the year 743, and the
chastisement by Tiglath-pileser occurred in the lifetime of the allies,
whereas Pekah was assassinated in the year 739, the interval between the
commencement of the war and the chastisement of the allies cannot have
been more than three years; so that the preparation of the table must
not be assigned to a much later period than the interview with Ahaz. The
inscription upon the table, which was adopted as the name of the child,
was not a purely consolatory prophecy, since the prophet had predicted,
a short time before, that the same Asshur which devastated the two
covenant lands would lay Judah waste as well. It was simply a practical
proof of the omniscience and omnipotence of God, by which the history of
the future was directed and controlled. The prophet had, in fact, the
mournful vocation to harden. Hence the enigmatical character of his
words and doings in relation to both kings and nation. Jehovah foreknew
the consequences which would follow the appeal to Asshur for help, as
regarded both Syria and Israel. This knowledge he committed to writing
in the presence of witnesses. When this should be fulfilled, it would be
all over with the rejoicing of the king and people at their self-secured
deliverance.

But Isaiah was not merely within the broader circle of an incorrigible
nation ripe for judgment. He did not stand alone; but was encircled by a
small band of believing disciples, who wanted consolation, and were
worthy of it. It was to them that the more promising obverse of the
prophecy of Immanuel belonged. Mahershalal could not comfort them; for
they knew that when Asshur had done with Damascus and Samaria, the
troubles of Judah would not be over, but would only then be really about
to commence. To be the shelter of the faithful in the terrible judicial
era of the imperial power, which was then commencing, was the great
purpose of the prediction of Immanuel; and to bring out and expand the
consolatory character of that prophecy for the benefit of believers, was
the design of the addresses which follow.

[Isaiah 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 8:5</span></span>

The heading or introduction, "And Jehovah proceeded still further to
speak to me, as follows," extends to all the following addresses as far
as [Isa 12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md). They all finish with
consolation. But consolation presupposes the need of consolation.
Consequently, even in this instance the prophet is obliged to commence
with a threatening of judgment. "Forasmuch as this people despiseth the
waters of Siloah that go softly, and regardeth as a delight the alliance
with Rezin and the son of Remalyahu, therefore, behold! the Lord of all
bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, the mighty and the great,
the king of Asshur and all his military power; and he riseth over all
his channels, and goeth over all his banks." The Siloah had its name
(Shiloach, or, according to the reading of this passage contained in
very good MSS, Shilloach), ab emittendo, either in an infinitive sense,
"shooting forth," or in a participial sense, with a passive colouring,
emissus, sent forth, spirted out (vid., [Joh
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007.md); and on the variations in meaning
of this substantive form, Concord. p. 1349, s.). Josephus places the
fountain and pool of Siloah at the opening of the Tyropoeon, on the
south-eastern side of the ancient city, where we still find it at the
present day (vid., Jos. Wars of the Jews, v. 4, 1; also Robinson, Pal.
i. 504). The clear little brook - a pleasant sight to the eye as it
issues from the ravine which runs between the south-western slope of
Moriah and the south-eastern slope of Mount Zion

(Note: It is with perfect propriety, therefore, that Jerome sometimes
speaks in the fons Siloe as flowing ad radices Montis Zion, and at other
times as flowing in radicibus Montis Moria.)

(V. Schulbert, Reise, ii. 573) - is used here as a symbol of the Davidic
monarchy enthroned upon Zion, which had the promise of God, who was
enthroned upon Moriah, in contrast with the imperial or world kingdom,
which is compared to the overflowing waters of the Euphrates. The
reproach of despising the waters of Siloah applied to Judah as well as
Ephraim: to the former because it trusted in Asshur, and despised the
less tangible but more certain help which the house of David, if it were
but believing, had to expect from the God of promise; to the latter,
because it had entered into alliance with Aram to overthrow the house of
David; and yet the house of David, although degenerate and deformed, was
the divinely appointed source of that salvation, which is ever realized
through quiet, secret ways. The second reproach applied more especially
to Ephraim. The 'eth is not to be taken as the sign of the accusative,
for sūs never occurs with the accusative of the object (not even in [Isa
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001).md), and could not well be so used.
It is to be construed as a preposition in the sense of "and (or because)
delight (is felt) with (i.e., in) the alliance with Rezin and Pekah."
(On the constructive before a preposition, see Ges. 116, 1: sūs 'ēth,
like râtzâh ‛im.) Luzzatto compares, for the construction, [Gen
41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043.md), v'nâthōn; but only the inf.
abs. is used in this way as a continuation of the finite verb (see Ges.
131, 4, a). Moreover, משׂושׂ is not an Aramaic infinitive, but a
substantive used in such a way as to retain the power of the verb (like
מסּע in [Num 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002.md), and מספר in [Num
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010.md), unless, indeed, the reading
here should be ספר מי). The substantive clause is preferred to the
verbal clause ושׂשׂ, for the sake of the antithetical consonance of
משׂושׂס with מאס. It is also quite in accordance with Hebrew syntax,
that an address which commences with כי יען should here lose itself in
the second sentence "in the twilight," as Ewald expresses it (351, c),
of a substantive clause. Knobel and others suppose the reproof to relate
to dissatisfied Judaeans, who were secretly favourable to the enterprise
of the two allied kings. But there is no further evidence that there
were such persons; and [Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md) is
opposed to this interpretation. The overflowing of the Assyrian forces
would fall first of all upon Ephraim. The threat of punishment is
introduced with ולכן, the Vav being the sign of sequence (Ewald, 348,
b). The words "the king of Asshur" are the prophet's own gloss, as in
[Isa 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017.md), [Isa
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020.md).

[Isaiah 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 8:8</span></span>

Not till then would this overflowing reach as far as Judah, but then it
would do so most certainly and incessantly."And presses forward into
Judah, overflows and pours onward, till it reaches to the neck, and the
spreading out of its wings fill the breadth of thy land, Immanuel." The
fate of Judah would be different from that of Ephraim. Ephraim would be
laid completely under water by the river, i.e., would be utterly
destroyed. And in Judah the stream, as it rushed forward, would reach
the most dangerous height; but if a deliverer could be found, there was
still a possibility of its being saved. Such a deliverer was Immanuel,
whom the prophet sees in the light of the Spirit living through all the
Assyrian calamities. The prophet appeals complainingly to him that the
land, which is his land, is almost swallowed up by the world-power: the
spreadings out (muttoth, a hophal noun: for similar substantive forms,
see [Isa 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006.md); [Isa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md), and more especially [Psa
66:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#011).md) of the wings of the stream
(i.e., of the large bodies of water pouring out on both sides from the
main stream, as from the trunk, and covering the land like two broad
wings) have filled the whole land. According to Norzi, Immanul is to be
written here as one word, as it is in [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md); but the correct reading is Immân
El, with mercha silluk (see note on [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md), though it does not therefore
cease to be a proper name. As Jerome observes, it is nomen proprium, non
interpretatum; and so it is rendered in the Sept., Μεθ ̓ ἡμῶν ὁ Θεός.

[Isaiah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 8:9</span></span>

The prophet's imploring look at Immanuel does not remain unanswered. We
may see this from the fact, that what was almost a silent prayer is
changed at once into the jubilate of holy defiance. "Exasperate
yourselves, O nations, and go to pieces; and see it, all who are far off
in the earth! Gird yourselves, and go to pieces; gird yourselves, and go
to pieces! Consult counsel, and it comes to nought; speak the word, and
it is not realized: for with us is God." The second imperatives in [Isa
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md) are threatening words of
authority, having a future signification, which change into futures in
[Isa 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019) (Ges. 130, 2.md): Go on
exasperating yourselves רעוּ( with the tone upon the penultimate, and
therefore not the pual of רעה, consociari, which is the rendering
adopted in the Targum, but the kal of רעע, malum esse; not vociferari,
for which רוּע, a different verb from the same root, is commonly
employed), go on arming; ye will nevertheless fall to pieces (Chōttu,
from Châthath, related to Câthath, Confringi, Consternari). The prophet
classes together all the nations that are warring against the people of
God, pronounces upon them the sentence of destruction, and calls upon
all distant lands to hear this ultimate fate of the kingdom of the
world, i.e., of the imperial power. The world-kingdom must be wrecked on
the land of Immanuel; "for with us," as the watchword of believers runs,
pointing to the person of the Savour, "with us is God."

[Isaiah 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 8:11</span></span>

There then follows in [Isa 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md) an
explanatory clause, which seems at first sight to pass on to a totally
different theme, but it really stands in the closest connection with the
triumphant words of [Isa 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md), [Isa
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010.md). It is Immanuel whom believers
receive, constitute, and hold fast as their refuge in the approaching
times of the Assyrian judgment. He is their refuge and God in Him, and
not any human support whatever. This is the link of connection with [Isa
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md), [Isa
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012.md) : "For Jehovah hath spoken thus
to me, overpowering me with God's hand, and instructing me not to walk
in the way of this people, saying, Call ye not conspiracy all that this
people calls conspiracy; and what is feared by it, fear ye not, neither
think ye dreadful." היד, "the hand," is the absolute hand, which is no
sooner laid upon a man than it overpowers all perception, sensation, and
though: Chezkath hayyâd (viz., âlai, upon me, [Eze
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014).md) therefore describes a condition
in which the hand of God was put forth upon the prophet with peculiar
force, as distinguished from the more usual prophetic state, the effect
of a peculiarly impressive and energetic act of God. Luther is wrong in
following the Syriac, and adopting the rendering, "taking me by the
hand;" as Chezkath points back to the kal (invalescere), and not to the
hiphil (apprehendere). It is this circumstantial statement, which is
continued in v'yissereni ("and instructing me"), and not the leading
verb âmar ("he said"); for the former is not the third pers. pret. piel,
which would be v'yisserani, but the third pers. fut. kal, from the
future form yissōr ([Hos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#010.md),
whereas the fut. piel is v'yassēr); and it is closely connected with
Chezkath hayyâd, according to the analogy of the change from the
participial and infinitive construction to the finite verb (Ges. 132,
Anm. 2). With this overpowering influence, and an instructive warning
against going in the way of "this people," Jehovah spake to the prophet
as follows. With regard to the substance of the following warning, the
explanation that has been commonly adopted since the time of Jerome,
viz., noli duorum regum timere conjurationem (fear not the conspiracy of
the two kings), is contrary to the reading of the words. The warning
runs thus: The prophet, and such as were on his side, were not to call
that kesher which the great mass of the people called kesher (cf., [Ch2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#013.md), "She said, Treason, Treason!"
kesher, kesher); yet the alliance of Rezin and Pekah was really a
conspiracy - a league against the house and people of David. Nor can the
warning mean that believers, when they saw how the unbelieving Ahaz
brought the nation into distress, were not to join in a conspiracy
against the person of the king (Hofmann, Drechsler); they are not warned
at all against making a conspiracy, but against joining in the popular
cry when the people called out kesher. The true explanation has been
given by Roorda, viz., that the reference is to the conspiracy, as it
was called, of the prophet and his disciples ("sermo hic est de
conjuratione, quae dicebatur prophetae et discipulorum ejus"). The same
thing happened to Isaiah as to Amos ([Amo
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010).md) and to Jeremiah. Whenever the
prophets were at all zealous in their opposition to the appeal for
foreign aid, they were accused and branded as standing in the service of
the enemy, and conspiring for the overthrow of the kingdom. In such
perversion of language as this, the honourable among them were not to
join. The way of God was now a very different one from the way of that
people. If the prophet and his followers opposed the alliance with
Asshur, this was not a common human conspiracy against the will of the
king and nation, but the inspiration of God, the true policy of Jehovah.
Whoever trusted in Him had no need to be afraid of such attempts as
those of Rezin and Pekah, or to look upon them as dreadful.

[Isaiah 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 8:13</span></span>

The object of their fear was a very different one. "Jehovah of hosts,
sanctify Him; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your terror. So
will He become a sanctuary, but a stone of stumbling and a rock of
offence (vexation) to both the houses of Israel, a snare and trap to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble, and shall
fall; and be dashed to pieces, and be snared and taken." The logical
apodosis to [Isa 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#013.md) commences with
v'hâhâh (so shall He be). If ye actually acknowledge Jehovah the Holy
One as the Holy One (hikdı̄sh, as in [Isa
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023).md), and if it is He whom ye fear,
and who fills you with dread (ma‛arı̄tz, used for the object of dread, as
mōrah is for the object of fear; hence "that which terrifies" in a
causative sense), He will become a mikdâsh. The word mikdâsh may indeed
denote the object sanctified, and so Knobel understands it here
according to [Num 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#029.md); but if we
adhere to the strict notion of the word, this gives an unmeaning
apodosis. Mikdâsh generally means the sanctified place or sanctuary,
with which the idea of an asylum would easily associate itself, since
even among the Israelites the temple was regarded and respected as an
asylum ([Kg1 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#050.md); [Kg1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028).md). This is the explanation which
most of the commentators have adopted here; and the punctuators also
took it in the same sense, when they divided the two halves of [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md) by athnach as antithetical. And
mikdâsh is really to be taken in this sense, although it cannot be
exactly rendered "asylum," since this would improperly limit the meaning
of the word. The temple was not only a place of shelter, but also of
grace, blessing, and peace. All who sanctified the Lord of lords He
surrounded like temple walls; hid them in Himself, whilst death and
tribulation reigned without, and comforted, fed, and blessed them in His
own gracious fellowship. This is the true explanation of v'hâyâh
l'mikdâs, according to such passages as [Isa
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md); [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md); [Psa
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021.md). To the two houses of Israel, on
the contrary, i.e., to the great mass of the people of both kingdoms who
neither sanctified nor feared Jehovah, He would be a rock and snare. The
synonyms are intentionally heaped together (cf., [Isa
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013).md), to produce the fearful
impression of death occurring in many forms, but all inevitable. The
first three verbs of [Isa 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#015.md) refer
to the "stone" ('eben) and "rock" (tzūr); the last two to the "snare"
(pach), and "trap" or springe (mōkēsh).

(Note: Malbim observes quite correctly, that "the pach catches, but does
not hurt; the mokesh catches and hurts (e.g., by seizing the legs or
nose, [Job 40:24](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#024).md): the former is a
simple snare (or net), the latter a springe, or snare which catches by
means of a spring" ([Amo 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#005))..md)

All who did not give glory to Jehovah would be dashed to pieces upon His
work as upon a stone, and caught therein as in a trap. This was the
burden of the divine warning, which the prophet heard for himself and
for those that believed.

[Isaiah 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 8:16</span></span>

The words that follow in [Isa 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016.md),
"Bind up the testimony, seal the lesson in my disciples," appear at
first sight to be a command of God to the prophet, according to such
parallel passages as [Dan 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md), [Dan
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#009.md); [Rev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010.md), cf., [Dan
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026.md); but with this explanation it is
impossible to do justice to the words "in my disciples" (b'ilmmudâi).
The explanation given by Rosenmller, Knobel, and others, viz., "by
bringing in men divinely instructed" (adhibitis viris piis et
sapientibus), is grammatically inadmissible. Consequently I agree with
Vitringa, Drechsler, and others, in regarding [Isa
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016.md) as the prophet's own prayer to
Jehovah. We tie together (צרר, imperf. צור = צר) what we wish to keep
from getting separated and lost; we seal (Châtam) what is to be kept
secret, and only opened by a person duly qualified. And so the prophet
here prays that Jehovah would take his testimony with regard to the
future, and his instruction, which was designed to prepare for this
future - that testimony and thorah which the great mass in their
hardness did not understand, and in their self-hardening despised - and
lay them up well secured and well preserved, as if by band and seal, in
the hearts of those who received the prophet's words with believing
obedience (limmūd, as in [Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md);
[Isa 54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013).md). For it would be all over
with Israel, unless a community of believers should be preserved, and
all over with this community, if the word of God, which was the ground
of their life, should be allowed to slip from their hearts. We have here
an announcement of the grand idea, which the second part of the book of
Isaiah carries out in the grandest style. It is very evident that it is
the prophet himself who is speaking here, as we may see from [Isa
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md), where he continues to speak in
the first person, though he does not begin with ואני.

[Isaiah 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 8:17</span></span>

Whilst offering this prayer, and looking for its fulfilment, he waits
upon Jehovah. "And I wait upon Jehovah, who hides His face before the
house of Jacob, and hope for Him." A time of judgment had now commenced,
which would still last a long time; but the word of God was the pledge
of Israel's continuance in the midst of it, and of the renewal of
Israel's glory afterwards. The prophet would therefore hope for the
grace which was now hidden behind the wrath.

[Isaiah 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 8:18</span></span>

His home was the future, and to this he was subservient, even with all
his house. "Behold, I and the children which Jehovah hath given me for
signs and types in Israel, from Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth upon
Mount Zion." He presents himself to the Lord with his children, puts
himself and them into His hands. They were Jehovah's gift, and that for
a higher purpose than every-day family enjoyment. They subserved the
purpose of signs and types in connection with the history of salvation.
"Signs and types:" 'oth (sign) was an omen or prognostic (σημεῖον) in
word and deed, which pointed to and was the pledge of something future
(whether it were in itself miraculous or natural); mopheth was either
something miraculous (τέρας) pointing back to a supernatural cause, or a
type (τύπος, prodigium = porridigium) which pointed beyond itself to
something future and concealed, literally twisted round, i.e., out of
the ordinary course, paradoxical, striking, standing out (Arab. aft,
ift, res mira, δεινόν τι), from אפת (related to הפך, אבך) = מאפת, like
מוסר = מאסר. His children were signs and enigmatical symbols of the
future, and that from Jehovah of hosts who dwelt on Zion. In accordance
with His counsel (to which the עם in מעם points), He had selected these
signs and types: He who could bring to pass the future, which they set
forth, as surely as He was Jehovah of hosts, and who would bring it to
pass as surely as He had chosen Mount Zion for the scene of His gracious
presence upon earth. Shear-yashub and Mahershalal were indeed no less
symbols of future wrath than of future grace; but the name of the father
(Yesha'hâhu) was an assurance that all the future would issue from
Jehovah's salvation, and end in the same. Isaiah and his children were
figures and emblems of redemption, opening a way for itself through
judgment. The Epistle to the Hebrews ([Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013).md) quotes these words as the
distinct words of Jesus, because the spirit of Jesus was in Isaiah - the
spirit of Jesus, which in the midst of this holy family, bound together
as it was only to the bands of "the shadow," pointed forward to that
church of the New Testament which would be found together by the bands
of the true substance. Isaiah, his children, and his wife, who is called
"the prophetess" (nebi'ah) not only because she was the wife of the
prophet but because she herself possessed the gift of prophecy, and all
the believing disciples gathered round this family - these together
formed the stock of the church of the Messianic future, on the
foundation and soil of the existing massa perdita of Israel.

[Isaiah 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 8:19</span></span>

It is to this ecclesiola in ecclesia that the prophet's admonition is
addressed. "And when they shall say to you, Inquire of the necromancers,
and of the soothsayers that chirp and whisper:-Should not a people
inquire of its God? for the living to the dead?" The appeal is supposed
to be made by Judaeans of the existing stamp; for we know from [Isa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006.md); [Isa
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002.md), that all kinds of heathen
superstitions had found their way into Jerusalem, and were practised
there as a trade. The persons into whose mouths the answer is put by the
prophet (we may supply before [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md), "Thus shall ye say to them;"
cf., [Jer 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011).md), are his own children
and disciples. The circumstances of the times were very critical; and
the people were applying to wizards to throw light upon the dark future.
'Ob signified primarily the spirit of witchcraft, then the possessor of
such a spirit (equivalent to Baal ob), more especially the necromancer.
Yidd‛oni, on the other hand, signified primarily the possessor of a
prophesying or soothsaying spirit (πύθων or πνεῦμα τοῦ πύθωνος), Syr.
yodūa‛ (after the intensive from pâ‛ul with immutable vowels), and then
the soothsaying spirit itself ([Lev
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027).md), which was properly called
yiddâ'ōn (the much knowing), like δαίμων, which, according to Plato, is
equivalent to δαήμων. These people, who are designated by the lxx, both
here and elsewhere, as ἐγγαστρόμυθοι, i.e., ventriloquists, imitated the
chirping of bats, which was supposed to proceed from the shadows of
Hades, and uttered their magical formulas in a whispering tone.

(Note: The Mishnah Sanhedrin 65a gives this definition: "Baal'ob is a
python, i.e., a soothsayer ('with a spirit of divination'), who speaks
from his arm-pit; yidd‛oni, a man who speaks with his mouth." The baal
ob, so far as he had to do with the bones of the dead, is called in the
Talmud obâ temayya', e.g., the witch of Endor (b. Sabbath 152b). On the
history of the etymological explanation of the word, see Bttcher, de
inferis, 205-217. If 'ob, a skin or leather bottle, is a word from the
same root (rendered "bellows" by the lxx at [Job
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#019).md), as it apparently is, it may be
applied to a bottle as a thing which swells or can be blown out, and to
a wizard of spirit of incantation on account of this puffing and
gasping. The explanation "le revenant," from אוּב = Arab. âba, to
return, has only a very weak support in the proper name איוב = avvâb
(the penitent, returning again and again to God: see again at [Isa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004))..md)

What an unnatural thing, for the people of Jehovah to go and inquire,
not of their won God, but of such heathenish and demoniacal deceivers
and victims as these (dârash 'el, to go and inquire of a person, [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md), synonymous with shâ'ar b', [Sa1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006).md)! What blindness, to consult the
dead in the interests of the living! By "the dead" (hammēthim) we are
not to understand "the idols" in this passage, as in [Psa
106:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028.md), but the departed, as [Deu
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#011) (cf., 1 Sam 28.md) clearly proves;
and בּעד is not to be taken, either here or elsewhere, as equivalent to
tachath ("instead of"), as Knobel supposes, but, as in [Jer
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002.md) and other passages, as signifying
"for the benefit of." Necromancy, which makes the dead the instructors
of the living, is a most gloomy deception.

[Isaiah 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 8:20</span></span>

In opposition to such a falling away to wretched superstition, the
watchword of the prophet and his supporters is this. "To the teaching of
God (thorah, Gotteslehre), and to the testimony! If they do not accord
with this word, they are a people for whom no morning dawns." The
summons, "to the teaching and to the testimony" (namely, to those which
Jehovah gave through His prophet, [Isa
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017).md), takes the form of a watchword
in time of battle ([Jdg 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#018).md). With
this construction the following אם־לא (which Knobel understands
interrogatively, "Should not they speak so, who, etc.?" and Luzzatto as
an oath, as in [Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md), "Surely
they say such words as have no dawn in them") has, at any rate, all the
presumption of a conditional signification. Whoever had not this
watchword would be regarded as the enemy of Jehovah, and suffer the fate
of such a man. This is, to all appearance, the meaning of the apodosis
שׁהר אין־לו אשׁר. Luther has given the meaning correctly, "If they do
not say this, they will not have the morning dawn;" or, according to his
earlier and equally good rendering, "They shall never overtake the
morning light," literally, "They are those to whom no dawn arises." The
use of the plural in the hypothetical protasis, and the singular in the
apodosis, is an intentional and significant change. All the several
individuals who did not adhere to the revelation made by Jehovah through
His prophet, formed one corrupt mass, which would remain in hopeless
darkness. אשׁר is used in the same sense as in [Isa
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028.md) and [Sa2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004.md), and possibly also as in [Sa1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#020.md), instead of the more usual כּי,
when used in the affirmative sense which springs in both particles out
of the confirmative (namque and quoniam): Truly they have no morning
dawn to expect.

(Note: Strangely enough, [Isa 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md) and
[Isa 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md) are described in Lev. Rabba,
ch. xv, as words of the prophet Hosea incorporated in the book of
Isaiah.)

[Isaiah 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 8:21</span></span>

The night of despair to which the unbelieving nation would be brought,
is described in [Isa 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#021.md), [Isa
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md) : "And it goes about therein hard
pressed and hungry: and it comes to pass, when hunger befals it, it
frets itself, and curses by its king and by its God, and turns its face
upward, and looks to the earth, and beyond distress and darkness,
benighting with anguish, and thrust out into darkness." The singulars
attach themselves to the לו in [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md), which embraces all the
unbelievers in one mass; "therein" (bâh) refers to the self-evident land
('eretz). The people would be brought to such a plight in the
approaching Assyrian oppressions, that they would wander about in the
land pressed down by their hard fate (niksheh) and hungry (râ'eb),
because all provisions would be gone and the fields and vineyards would
be laid waste. As often as it experienced hunger afresh, it would work
itself into a rage (v'hithkazzaqph with Vav apod. and pathach, according
to Ges. 54, Anm.), and curse by its king and God, i.e., by its idol.
This is the way in which we must explain the passage, in accordance with
[Sa1 14:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#043.md), where killel bēholim is
equivalent to killel b'shēm elohim, and with [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md), where a distinction is made
between an oath layehovâh, and an oath b'malcâm; if we would adhere to
the usage of the language, in which we never find a בּ קלל corresponding
to the Latin execrari in aliquem (Ges.), but on the contrary the object
cursed is always expressed in the accusative. We must therefore give up
[Psa 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003.md) and [Psa
68:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#025.md) as parallels to b'malco and
b'lohâi: they curse by the idol, which passes with them for both king
and God, curse their wretched fate with this as they suppose the most
effectual curse of all, without discerning in it the just punishment of
their own apostasy, and humbling themselves penitentially under the
almighty hand of Jehovah. Consequently all this reaction of their wrath
would avail them nothing: whether they turned upwards, to see if the
black sky were not clearing, or looked down to the earth, everywhere
there would meet them nothing but distress and darkness, nothing but a
night of anguish all around (me‛ūph zūkâh is a kind of summary; mâ‛ūph a
complete veiling, or eclipse, written with ū instead of the more usual ō
of this substantive form: Ewald, 160, a). The judgment of God does not
convert them, but only heightens their wickedness; just as in [Rev
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#011.md), [Rev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021.md), after the pouring out of the
fifth and seventh vials of wrath, men only utter blasphemies, and do not
desist from their works. After stating what the people see, whether they
turn their eyes upwards or downwards, the closing participial clause of
[Isa 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md) describes how they see
themselves "thrust out into darkness' (in caliginem propulsum). There is
no necessity to supply הוּא; but out of the previous hinnēh it is easy
to repeat hinno or hinnennu (en ipsum). "Into darkness:" ăphēlâh (acc.
loci) is placed emphatically at the head, as in [Jer
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012.md).
