### [1 Chronicles Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 22:1</span></span>

With this chapter commences the second section of the history of David's
kingship, viz., the account of the preparations, dispositions, and
arrangements which he made in the last years of his reign for the
establishment of his kingdom in the future under his successors. All
these preparations and dispositions had reference to the firm
establishment of the public worship of the Lord, in which Israel, as the
people and congregation of Jahve, might show its faithfulness to the
covenant, so as to become partakers of the divine protection, and the
blessing which was promised. To build the temple-this desire the Lord
had not indeed granted the fulfilment of to David, but He had given him
the promise that his son should carry out that work. The grey-haired
king accordingly made preparations, after the site of the house of God
which should be built had been pointed out to him, such as would
facilitate the execution of the work by his successor. Of these
preparations our chapter treats, and in it we have an account how David
provided the necessary labour and materials for the building of the
temple ([Ch1 22:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002).md), committed the
execution of the work in a solemn way to his son Solomon ([Ch1
22:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#006).md), and called upon the chiefs
of the people to give him their support in the work ([Ch1
22:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#017).md).

[1 Chronicles 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 22:2</span></span>

Workmen and materials for the building of the temple. - [Ch1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002.md). In order to procure the
necessary workmen, David commanded that the strangers in the land of
Israel should be gathered together, and, as we learn from [Ch2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016.md), also numbered. הגּרים, the
strangers, are the descendants of the Canaanites whom the Israelites had
not destroyed when they took possession of the land, but had reduced to
bondage ([Ch2 8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#007.md); [Kg1
9:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020).md). This number was so
considerable, that Solomon was able to employ 150,000 of them as
labourers and stone-cutters ([Kg1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015.md).; [Ch2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016)..md). These strangers David
appointed to be stone-cutters, to hew squared stones, גזית אבני (see on
[Kg1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018).md).

[Ch1 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#003.md)

Iron and brass he prepared in abundance: the iron for the nails of the
doors, i.e., for the folding-doors of the gates, i.e., partly for the
pivots (Zapfen) on which the folding-doors turned, partly to strengthen
the boards of which doors were made; as also for the מחבּרות, literally,
things to connect, i.e., properly iron cramps.

[Ch1 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#004.md)

The Tyrians sent him cedar trees or beams in abundance, probably in
exchange for grain, wine, and fruit of various sorts, which the
Phoenicians obtained from the Israelites; cf. Movers, Phnizier, iii. 1,
S. 88ff. Sidonians and Tyrians are named to denote the Phoenicians
generally, as in [Ezr 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007.md). When
Solomon began to build the temple, he made a regular treaty with Hiram
king of Tyre about the delivery of the necessary cedar wood, [Kg1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015.md).

[Ch1 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#005.md)

[Ch1 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#005.md) gives in substance the
reason of what precedes, although it is connected with it only by ו
consec. Because his son Solomon was still in tender youth, and the
building to be executed was an exceedingly great work, David determined
to make considerable preparation before his death. ורך נער ור, puer et
tener, repeated in [Ch1 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001.md),
indicates a very early age. Solomon could not then be quite twenty years
old, as he was born only after the Syro-Ammonite war (see on [Sa2
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#024).md), and calls himself at the
commencement of his reign still קטן נער ([Kg1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007).md). The word נער may of itself
denote not merely a boy, but also a grown youth; but here it is limited
to the boyish age by the addition of ורך. Berth. wrongly compares [Exo
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011.md), where נער denotes not a boy,
but a lad, i.e., a servant. In the succeeding clause ליהוה לבנות is to
be taken relatively: and the house which is to be built to the Lord is
to be made great exceedingly (למעלה, see on [Ch1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#002).md), for a name and glory for all
lands, i.e., that it might be to the Lord for whom it should be built
for an honour and glory in all lands. לו נא אכינה, I will (= therefore
will I) prepare for him (Solomon), scil. whatever I can prepare to
forward this great work.

[1 Chronicles 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 22:6</span></span>

Solomon commissioned to build the temple. - [Ch1
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#006.md). Before his death ([Ch1
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#005).md) David called his son Solomon, in
order to commit to him the building of the temple, and to press it
strongly upon him, [Ch1 22:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#007.md). With
this design, he informs him that it had been his intention to build a
temple to the Lord, but the Lord had not permitted him to carry out this
resolve, but had committed it to his son. The Keri בּני ([Ch1
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#007).md) is, notwithstanding the general
worthlessness of the corrections in the Keri, probably to be preferred
here to the Keth. בּנו, for בּנו might have easily arisen by the
copyist's eye having wandered to בּנו לשׁלמה, [Ch1
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#006.md). David's addressing him as בּני
is very fitting, nay, even necessary, and not contrary to the following
אני. לבבי עם, it was with my heart, i.e., I had intended, occurs indeed
very often in the Chronicle, e.g., [Ch1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md); [Ch2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011.md); [Ch2
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#007.md)., [Ch1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md); [Ch1
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#004.md); [Ch1
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#010.md), but is also found in other
books where the sense demands it, e.g., [Jos
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#007.md); [Kg1
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#017.md)., [Ch1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#002.md). In עלי ויהי, There came to me
the word of Jahve ([Ch1 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#008).md), it is
implied that the divine word was given to him as a command. The reason
which David gives why the Lord did not allow him to build the temple is
not stated in 1 Chron 17 (2 Sam 7), to which David here refers; instead
of the reason, only the promise is there communicated, that the Lord
would first build him a house, and enduringly establish his throne. This
promise does not exclude the reason stated here and in [Ch1
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#003.md), but rather implies it. As the
temple was only to be built when God had enduringly established the
throne of David, David could not execute this work, for he still had to
conduct wars - wars, too, of the Lord - for the establishment of his
kingdom, as Solomon also states it in his embassy to Hiram. Wars and
bloodshed, however, are unavoidable and necessary in this earth for the
establishment of the kingdom of God in opposition to its enemies, but
are not consonant with its nature, as it was to receive a visible
embodiment and expression in the temple. For the kingdom of God is in
its essence a kingdom of peace; and battle, or war, or struggle, are
only means for the restoration of peace, the reconciliation of mankind
with God after the conquest of sin and all that is hostile to God in
this world. See on [Sa2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011.md). David,
therefore, the man of war, is not to build the temple, but ([Ch1
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009)..md) his son; and to him the Lord
will give peace from all his enemies, so that he shall be מנוּחה אישׁ, a
man of rest, and shall rightly bear the name Shelomo (Solomon), i.e.,
Friederich (rich in peace, Eng. Frederick), for God would give to Israel
in his days, i.e., in his reign, peace and rest (שׁקט). The participle
נולד after הנּה has the signification of the future, shall be born; cf.
[Kg1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002.md). מנוּחה אישׁ, not a man who
procures peace ([Jer 51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059).md), but one
who enjoys peace, as the following לו והניחותי shows. As to the name
שׁלמה, see on [Sa2 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#024.md). Into [Ch1
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#010.md) David compresses the promise
contained in [Ch1 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#012.md) and [Ch1
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#013.md).

[1 Chronicles 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 22:11</span></span>

After David had so committed to his son Solomon the building of the
temple, as task reserved and destined for him by the divine counsel, he
wishes him, in [Ch1 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#011.md), the help of
the Lord to carry out the work. והצלחתּ, ut prospere agas et felici
successu utaris (J. M. Mich.), cf. [Jos
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#008.md). על דּבּר of a command from on
high; cf. עלי .f, [Ch1 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#008.md). Above
all, however, he wishes ([Ch1 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#012).md)
him right understanding and insight from God (וּבינה שׂכל, so connected
in [Ch2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011) also.md), and that God may
establish him over Israel, i.e., furnish him with might and wisdom to
rule over the people Israel; cf. [Sa2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011.md). ולשׁמור, "to observe" = and
mayest thou observe the law of Jahve; not thou must keep (Berth.), for
ולשׁמור is to be regarded as a continuation of the verb. finit.; cf. Ew.
351, c, S. 840.

[1 Chronicles 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 22:13</span></span>

The condition of obtaining the result is the faithful observing of the
commands of the Lord. The speech is filled with reminiscences of the
law, cf. [Deu 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#011.md); [Deu
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#032.md); and for the exhortation to be
strong and of good courage, cf. [Deu
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006.md); [Jos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#007.md), [Jos
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#009.md), etc.

[1 Chronicles 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 22:14</span></span>

In conclusion ([Ch1 22:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014).md), David
mentions what materials he has prepared for the building of the temple.
בּעניי, not, in my poverty (lxx, Vulg., Luth.), but, by my painful
labour (magna molestia et labore, Lavat.); cf. [Gen
31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042.md), and the corresponding
בּכל־כּוחי, [Ch1 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002.md). Gold 100,000
talents, and silver 1,000,000 talents. As the talent was 3000 shekels,
and the silver shekel coined by the Maccabees, according to the Mosaic
weight, was worth about 2s. 6d., the talent of silver would be about
375, and 1,000,000 talents 375,000,000. If we suppose the relative value
of the gold and silver to be as 10 to 1,100,000 talents of gold will be
about the same amount, or even more, viz., about 450,000,000, i.e., if
we take the gold shekel at thirty shillings, according to Thenius'
calculation. Such sums as eight hundred or eight hundred and twenty-five
millions of pounds are incredible. The statements, indeed, are not
founded upon exact calculation or weighing, but, as the round numbers
show, only upon a general valuation of those masses of the precious
metals, which we must not think of as bars of silver and gold, or as
coined money; for they were in great part vessels of gold and silver,
partly booty captured in war, partly tribute derived from the subject
peoples. Making all these allowances, however, the sums mentioned are
incredibly great, since we must suppose that even a valuation in round
numbers will have more or less correspondence to the actual weight, and
a subtraction of some thousands of talents from the sums mentioned would
make no very considerable diminution. On the other hand, it is a much
more important circumstance that the above estimate of the value in our
money of these talents of silver rests upon a presumption, the
correctness of which is open to well-founded doubts. For in that
calculation the weight of the Mosaic or holy shekel is taken as the
standard, and it is presumed that the talents weighed 3000 Mosaic
shekels. But we find in [Sa2 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#026.md)
mention made in David's time of another shekel, "according to the kings'
weight," whence we may with certainty conclude that in common life
another shekel than the Mosaic or holy shekel was in use. This shekel
according to the king's weight was in all probability only half as heavy
as the shekel of the sanctuary, i.e., was equal in weight to a Mosaic
beka or half-shekel. This is proved by a comparison of [Kg1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017.md) with [Ch2
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#016.md), for here three golden minae are
reckoned equal to 300 shekels-a mina containing 100 shekels, while it
contained only 50 holy or Mosaic shekels. With this view, too, the
statements of the Rabbins agree, e.g., R. Mosis Maimonidis
constitutiones de Siclis, quas - illustravit Joa. Esgers., Lugd. Bat.
1718, p. 19, according to which the שלחול שקל or המדינה שׁקל, i.e., the
common or civil shekel, is the half of the הקדשׁ שׁקל. That this is the
true relation, is confirmed by the fact that, according to [Exo
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#026.md), in the time of Moses there
existed silver coins weighing ten gera (half a holy shekel) called beka,
while the name beka is found only in the Pentateuch, and disappears at a
later time, probably because it was mainly such silver coins of ten gera
which were in circulation, and to them the name shekel, which denotes no
definite weight, was transferred. Now, if the amounts stated in our
verse are reckoned in such common shekels (as in [Ch2
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#016).md), the mass of gold and silver
collected by David for the building of the temple would only be worth
half the amount above calculated, i.e., about 375,000,000 or
400,000,000. But even this sum seems enormously large, for it is five
times the annual expenditure of the greatest European states in our day.

(Note: According to Otto Hbner, Statistical Table of all Lands of the
Earth, 18th edition, Frankf. a M. 1869, the yearly expenditure of Great
Britain and Ireland (exclusive of the extra-European possessions)
amounts to a little over 70,000,000; of the French Empire, to
85,000,000; of Russia, to about 78,000,000; of Austria and Hungary, to
48,500,000.)

Yet the calculation of the income or expenditure of modern states is no
proper standard for judging of the correctness of probability of the
statements here made, for we cannot estimate the accumulation of gold
and silver in the states and chief cities of Asia in antiquity by the
budgets of the modern European nations. In the capitals of the Asiatic
kingdoms of antiquity, enormous quantities of the precious metals were
accumulated. Not to mention the accounts of Ktesias, Diodor. Sic., and
others, which sound so fabulous to us now, as to the immense booty in
gold and silver vessels which was accumulated in Nineveh and Babylon
(see the table in Movers, die Phnizier, ii. 3, S. 40ff.), according to
Varro, in Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxxii. 15, Cyrus obtained by the conquest of
Asia a booty of 34,000 pounds of gold, besides that which was wrought
into vessels and ornaments, and 500,000 talents of silver; and in this
statement, as Movers rightly remarks, it does not seem probable that
there is any exaggeration. In Susa, Alexander plundered the royal
treasury of 40,000, according to other accounts 50,000 talents, or, as
it is more accurately stated, 40,000 talents of uncoined gold and
silver, and 9000 talents in coined darics. These he caused to be brought
to Ecbatana, where he accumulated in all 180,000 talents. In Persepolis
he captured a booty of 120,000 talents, and in Pasargada 6000 talents
(see Mov. loc cit. S. 43). Now David, it is true, had not conquered
Asia, but only the tribes and kingdoms bordering on Canaan, including
the kingdom of Syria, and made them tributary, and had consecrated all
the gold and silver taken as booty from the conquered peoples, from the
Syrians, Moabites, Ammonites, Philistines, Amalekites, and Hadadezer the
king of Zobah ([Sa2 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#011)..md), to Jahve.
Now, in consequence of the ancient connection between Syria and the rich
commercial countries of the neighbourhood, great treasures of silver and
gold had very early flowed in thither. According to [Sa2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#007), the servants (i.e., generals.md) of
King Hadadezer had golden shields, which David captured; and the
ambassadors of King Toi of Hamath brought him vessels of silver, gold,
and copper, to purchase his friendship.

(Note: Apropos of the riches of Syria even in later times, Movers
reminds us, S. 45, of the rich temple treasures - of the statue of
Jupiter in Antioch, which was of pure gold and fifteen yards high, and
of the golden statues in the temple at Hierapolis - and adds: "Even
Antiochus the Great had immense treasures in his possession. The private
soldiers in his army had their half-boots studded with gold nails, and
their cooking utensils were of silver." See the proofs, loc cit.)

The other peoples whom David overcame are not to be regarded as poor in
the precious metals. For the Israelites under Moses had captured so
large a booty in gold rings, bracelets, and other ornaments from the
nomadic Midianites, that the commanders of the army alone were able to
give 16,750 shekels (i.e., over 5 1/2 talents of gold, according to the
Mosaic weight) to the sanctuary as a consecrating offering ([Num
31:48](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#048)..md).

We cannot therefore regard the sums mentioned in our verse either as
incredible or very much exaggerated,

(Note: As Berth. for example does, expressing himself as follows: "In
our verse, 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, - a sum
with which the debts of the European nations might almost be paid! It is
absolutely inadmissible to take these at their literal value, and to
consider them as a repetition, though perhaps a somewhat exaggerated
one, of actual historical statements. They can have been originally
nothing else than the freest periphrasis for much, an extraordinary
quantity, such as may even yet be heard from the mouths of those who
have not reflected on the value and importance of numbers, and
consequently launch out into thousands and hundreds of thousands, in an
extremely unprejudiced way." On this we remark: (1) The assertion that
with the sums named in our verse the debts of the European nations could
be paid, is an enormous exaggeration. According to O. Hbner's tables,
the national debt of Great Britain and Ireland alone amounts to
809,000,000, that of France to 564,000,000, that of Russia to
400,000,000, that of Austria to 354,000,000, and that of the kingdom of
Italy to 258,000,000; David's treasures, consequently, if the weight be
taken in sacred shekels, would only have sufficed to pay the national
debt of Great Britain and Ireland. (2) The hypothesis that the
chronicler, without reflecting on the value and importance of numbers,
has launched out into thousands and hundreds of thousands, presupposes
such a measure of intellectual poverty as is irreconcilable with
evidences of intellect and careful planning such as are everywhere else
observable in his writing.)

nor hold the round sums which correspond to the rhetorical character of
the passage with certainty to be mistakes.

(Note: As proof of the incorrectness of the above numbers, it cannot be
adduced "that, according to [Kg1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md), Solomon's yearly revenue
amounted to 666 talents of gold, i.e., to about 3,000,000 in gold; that
the queen of Sheba presented Solomon with 120 talents of gold, [Kg1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010.md); [Ch2
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#009.md); and King Hiram also gave him a
similar amount, [Kg1 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#014.md); all of
which sums the context shows are to be considered extraordinarily great"
(Berth.). For the 666 talents of gold are not the entire annual income
of Solomon, but, according to the distinct statement of the Biblical
historian, are only the annual income in gold, exclusive of the receipts
from the customs, and the tributes of the subject kings and tribes,
which were probably more valuable. The 120 talents of the queen of Sheba
are certainly a very large present, but Solomon would give in return not
inconsiderable presents also. But the quantities of silver and gold
which David had collected for the building of the temple had not been
saved out of his yearly income, but had been in great part captured as
booty in war, and laid up out of the tribute of the subject peoples. A
question which would more readily occur than this is, Whether such
enormous sums were actually necessary for the temple? But the materials
necessary to enable us to arrive at even a proximate estimate of this
building are entirely wanting. The building of a stone temple from 60 to
70 yards long, 20 yards broad, and 30 yards high, would certainly not
have cost so much, notwithstanding that, as we read in [Ch2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#008.md)., 650 talents of gold were
required to gild the inner walls of the Holy Place, and at the same rate
2000 talents must have been required to gild the inside of the
Sanctuary, which was three times as large; and notwithstanding the great
number of massive gold vessels, e.g., the ten golden candlesticks, for
which alone, even if they were no larger and heavier than the
candlesticks in the tabernacle, ten talents of gold must have been
required. But there belonged to the temple many subordinate buildings,
which are not further described; as also the colossal foundation
structures and the walls enclosing the temple area, the building of
which must have swallowed up millions, since Solomon sent 70,000 porters
and 80,000 stone-hewers to Lebanon to procure the necessary materials.
Consul Rosen has recently indeed attempted to show, in das Haram von
Jerusalem und der Tempelplatz des Moria, Botha (1866), that there is
reason to suppose that the temple area was enlarged to the size it is
known to have had, and surrounded by a wall only by Herod; but he has
been refuted by Himpel in the Tbinger theol. Quartalschr. 1867, S.
515f., who advances very weighty reasons against his hypothesis.
Finally, we must have regard to the statement in [Kg1
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051.md) and [Ch2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md), that Solomon, after the building
was finished, deposited the consecrated silver and gold collected by his
father David among the temple treasures. Whence we learn that the
treasures collected by David were not intended merely for the building
of the House of God.)

Brass and iron were not weighed for abundance; cf. [Ch1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#003.md). Beams of timber also, and stones
- that is, stones hewed and squared - David had prepared; and to this
store Solomon was to add. That he did so is narrated in 2 Chr. 2.

David then turns to the workmen, the carpenters and stone-cutters, whom
he had appointed ([Ch1 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002).md) for the
building. חצבים, properly hewers, in [Ch1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002.md) limited to stone-hewers, is here,
with the addition ועץ אבן חרשׁי, used of the workers in stone and wood,
stonemasons and carpenters. כּל־חכם, all manner of understanding persons
in each work, in contradistinction to מלעכה עשׁי, includes the idea of
thorough mastery and skill in the kind of labour. These workmen, whom
David had levied for the building of the temple, are mentioned by
Solomon, [Ch2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006.md). - In [Ch1
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#016.md) all the metals, as being the
main thing, are again grouped together, in order that the exhortation to
proceed with the erection of the building may be introduced. The ל
before each word serves to bring the thing once more into prominence;
cf. Ew. 310, a. "As for the gold, it cannot be numbered." "Arise and be
doing! and Jahve be with thee" ([Ch1
22:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#017).md).

Exhortation to the princes of Israel to assist in the building of the
temple. - David supports his exhortation by calling to remembrance the
proofs of his favour which the Lord had showed His people. The speech in
[Ch1 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#018.md) is introduced without לאמר,
because it is clear from the preceding דויד ויצו that the words are
spoken by David: "The Lord has given you peace round about; for He has
given the inhabitants of the land into my hands, and the land is subdued
before Jahve and before His people." The subdued land is Canaan: the
inhabitants of the land are, however, not the Israelites over whom the
Lord had set David as king, for the words בּידי נתן cannot apply to
them, cf. [Ch1 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#010.md)., [Jos
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#024.md); it is the Canaanites still left
in the land in the time of David, and other enemies, who, like the
Philistines, possessed parts of the land, and had been subdued by David.
On הארץ נככּשׁה, cf. [Jos 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md); [Num
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#022.md), [Num
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#029.md). This safety which the Lord had
granted them binds them in duty to seek Him with all their heart, and to
build the sanctuary, that the ark and the sacred vessels may be brought
into it. The ל in לבּית is not a sign of the accusative (Berth.), for
הביא is not construed with accus. loci, but generally with אל, for
which, however, so early as [Jos 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#005.md),
ל is used, or it is construed with the acc. and ה locale - הבּיתה, [Gen
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#010.md); [Gen
43:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#017.md).
