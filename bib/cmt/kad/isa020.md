### [Isaiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 20:1</span></span>

This section, commencing in the form of historic prose, introduces
itself thus: "In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, Sargon the king of
Asshur having sent him (and he made war against Ashdod, and captured
it): at that time Jehovah spake through Yeshayahu the son of Amoz as
follows," i.e., He communicated the following revelation through the
medium of Isaiah (b'yad, as in [Isa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024.md); [Jer
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#002), and many other passages.md). The
revelation itself was attached to a symbolical act. B'yad (lit. "by the
hand of") refers to what was about to be made known through the prophet
by means of the command that was given him; in other words, to [Isa
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003.md), and indirectly to [Isa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002). Tartan (probably the same man.md)
is met with in [Kg2 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md) as the chief
captain of Sennacherib. No Assyrian king of the name of Sargon is
mentioned anywhere else in the Old Testament; but it may now be accepted
as an established result of the researches which have been made, that
Sargon was the successor of Shalmanassar, and that Shalmaneser (Shalman,
[Hos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014).md), Sargon, Sennacherib, and
Esarhaddon, are the names of the four Assyrian kings who were mixed up
with the closing history of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. It was
Longperrier who was the first to establish the identity of the monarch
who built the palaces at Khorsabad, which form the north-eastern corner
of ancient Nineveh, with the Sargon of the Bible. We are now acquainted
with a considerable number of brick, harem, votive-table, and other
inscriptions which bear the name of this king, and contain all kinds of
testimony concerning himself.

(Note: See Oppert, Expdition, i. 328-350, and the picture of Sargon in
his war-chariot in Rawlinson's Five Great Monarchies, i. 368; compare
also p. 304 (prisoners taken by Sargon), p. 352 (the plan of his
palace), p. 483 (a glass vessel with his name), and many other
engravings in vol. ii.)

It was he, not Shalmanassar, who took Samaria after a three years'
siege; and in the annalistic inscription he boasts of having conquered
the city, and removed the house of Omri to Assyria. Oppert is right in
calling attention to the fact, that in [Kg2
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#010.md) the conquest is not attributed
to Shalmanassar himself, but to the army. Shalmanassar died in front of
Samaria; and Sargon not only put himself at the head of the army, but
seized upon the throne, in which he succeeded in establishing himself,
after a contest of several years' duration with the legitimate heirs and
their party. He was therefore a usurper.

(Note: See Oppert, Les Inscriptions Assyriennes des Sargonides et les
Fastes de Ninive (Versailles, 1862), and Rawlinson (vol. ii. 406ff.),
who here agrees with Oppert in all essential points. Consequently there
can no longer be any thought of identifying Sargon with Shalmanassar
(see Brandis, Ueber den historischen Gewinn aus der Entzifferung der
assyr. Inschriften, 1856, p. 48ff.). Rawlinson himself at first thought
they were the same person (vid., Journal of the Asiatic Society, xii. 2,
419), until gradually the evidence increased that Sargon and
Shalmanassar were the names of two different kings, although no
independent inscription of the latter, the actual besieger of Samaria,
has yet been found.)

Whether his name as it appears on the inscriptions is Sar-kin or not,
and whether it signifies the king de facto as distinguished from the
king de jure, we will not attempt to determine now.

(Note: Hitzig ventures a derivation of the name from the Zend; and
Grotefend compares it with the Chaldee Sârēk, [Dan
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#003.md) (in his Abhandlung ber Anlage und
Zerstrung der Gebude von Nimrud, 1851).)

This Sargon, the founder of a new Assyrian dynasty, who reigned from
721-702 (according to Oppert), and for whom there is at all events
plenty of room between 721-20 and the commencement of Sennacherib's
reign, first of all blockaded Tyre for five years after the fall of
Samaria, or rather brought to an end the siege of Tyre which had been
begun by Shalmanassar (Jos. Ant. ix. 14, 2), though whether it was to a
successful end or not is quite uncertain. He then pursued with all the
greater energy his plan for following up the conquest of Samaria with
the subjugation of Egypt, which was constantly threatening the
possessions of Assyria in western Asia, either by instigation or
support. The attack upon Ashdod was simply a means to this end. As the
Philistines were led to join Egypt, not only by their situation, but
probably by kinship of tribe as well, the conquest of Ashdod - a
fortress so strong, that, according to Herodotus (ii. 157), Psammetichus
besieged it for twenty-nine years - was an indispensable preliminary to
the expedition against Egypt. When Alexander the Great marched against
Egypt, he had to do the same with Gaza. How long Tartan required is not
to be gathered from [Isa 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md). But if
he conquered it as quickly as Alexander conquered Gaza - viz. in five
months - it is impossible to understand why the following prophecy
should defer for three years the subjugation of Ethiopia and Egypt. The
words, "and fought against Ashdod, and took it," must therefore be taken
as anticipatory and parenthetical.

It was not after the conquest of Ashdod, but in the year in which the
siege commenced, that Isaiah received the following admonition: "Go and
loosen the smock-frock from off thy loins, and take off thy shoes from
thy feet. And he did so, went stripped and barefooted." We see from this
that Isaiah was clothed in the same manner as Elijah, who wore a fur
coat ([Kg2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008.md), cf., [Zac
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004.md); [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037).md), and John the Baptist, who had
a garment of camel hair and a leather girdle round it ([Mat
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004).md); for sak is a coarse linen or
hairy overcoat of a dark colour ([Rev
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012.md), cf., [Isa
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#003).md), such as was worn by mourners,
either next to the skin (‛al-habbâsâr, [Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027.md); [Kg2
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#030.md); [Job
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015).md) or over the tunic, in either
case being fastened by a girdle on account of its want of shape, for
which reason the verb châgar is the word commonly used to signify the
putting on of such a garment, instead of lâbash. The use of the word
ârōm does not prove that the former was the case in this instance (see,
on the contrary, [Sa2 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020.md), compared
with [Sa2 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014.md) and [Joh
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007).md). With the great importance
attached to the clothing in the East, where the feelings upon this point
are peculiarly sensitive and modest, a person was looked upon as
stripped and naked if he had only taken off his upper garment. What
Isaiah was directed to do, therefore, was simply opposed to common
custom, and not to moral decency. He was to lay aside the dress of a
mourner and preacher of repentance, and to have nothing on but his tunic
(cetoneth); and in this, as well as barefooted, he was to show himself
in public. This was the costume of a man who had been robbed and
disgraced, or else of a beggar or prisoner of war. The word cēn (so) is
followed by the inf. abs., which develops the meaning, as in [Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md); [Isa
58:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md).

[Isaiah 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 20:3</span></span>

It is not till Isaiah has carried out the divine instructions, that he
learns the reason for this command to strip himself, and the length of
time that he is to continue so stripped. "And Jehovah said, As my
servant Yesha'yahu goeth naked and barefooted, a sign and type for three
years long over Egypt and over Ethiopia, so will the king of Asshur
carry away the prisoners of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, children
and old men, naked and barefooted, and with their seat uncovered - a
shame to Egypt." The expression "as he goeth" (ca'asher hâlac) stands
here at the commencement of the symbolical action, but it is introduced
as if with a retrospective glance at its duration for three years,
unless indeed the preterite hâlac stands here, as it frequently does, to
express what has already commenced, and is still continuing and
customary (compare, for example, [Job
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#004.md) and [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md). The strange and unseemly dress
of the prophet, whenever he appeared in his official capacity for three
whole years, was a prediction of the fall of the Egypto-Ethiopian
kingdom, which was to take place at the end of these three years. Egypt
and Ethiopia are as closely connected here as Israel and Judah in [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012.md). They were at that time one
kingdom, so that the shame of Egypt was the shame of Ethiopia also.
‛Ervâh is a shameful nakedness, and ‛ervath Mitzrayim is in apposition
to all that precedes it in [Isa 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004.md).
Shēth is the seat or hinder part, as in [Sa2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004.md), from shâthâh, to set or seat; it
is a substantive form, like בּן, עץ, רע, שׁם, with the third radical
letter dropt. Chashūphay has the same ay as the words in [Isa
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#009.md); [Jdg
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#015.md); [Jer
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014.md), which can hardly be regarded as
constructive forms, as Ewald, Knobel, and Gesenius suppose (although ־י
of the construct has arisen from ־י), but rather as a singular form with
a collective signification. The emendations suggested, viz., chasūphē by
Olshausen, and chasūphı̄ with a connecting i by Meier, are quite
unnecessary.

[Isaiah 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 20:5</span></span>

But if Egypt and Ethiopia are thus shamefully humbled, what kind of
impression will this make upon those who rely upon the great power that
is supposed to be both unapproachable and invincible? "And they cry
together, and behold themselves deceived by Ethiopia, to which they
looked, and by Egypt, in which they gloried. And the inhabitant of this
coast-land saith in that day, Behold, thus it happens to those to whom
we looked, whither we fled for help to deliver us from the king of
Asshur: and how should we, we escape?" אי, which signifies both an
island and a coast-land, is used as the name of Philistia and [Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005.md), and as the name of Phoenicia in
[Isa 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002.md), [Isa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#006.md); and for this reason Knobel and
others understand it here as denoting the former with the inclusion of
the latter. But as the Assyrians had already attacked both Phoenicians
and Philistines at the time when they marched against Egypt, there can
be no doubt that Isaiah had chiefly the Judaeans in his mind. This was
the interpretation given by Jerome ("Judah trusted in the Egyptians, and
Egypt will be destroyed"), and it has been adopted by Ewald, Drechsler,
Luzzatto, and Meier. The expressions are the same as those in which a
little further on we find Isaiah reproving the Egyptian tendencies of
Judah's policy. At the same time, by "the inhabitant of this coast-land"
we are not to understand Judah exclusively, but the inhabitants of
Palestine generally, with whom Judah was mixed up to its shame, because
it had denied its character as the nation of Jehovah in a manner so
thoroughly opposed to its theocratic standing.

Unfortunately, we know very little concerning the Assyrian campaigns in
Egypt. But we may infer from [Nah
3:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md), according to which the
Egyptian Thebes had fallen (for it is held up before Nineveh as the
mirror of its own fate), that after the conquest of Ashdod Egypt was
also overcome by Sargon's army. In the grand inscription found in the
halls of the palace at Khorsabad, Sargon boasts of a successful battle
which he had fought with Pharaoh Sebech at Raphia, and in consequence of
which the latter became tributary to him. Still further on he relates
that he had dethroned the rebellious king of Ashdod, and appointed
another in his place, but that the people removed him, and chose another
king; after which he marched with his army against Ashdod, and when the
king fled from him into Egypt, he besieged Ashdod, and took it. Then
follows a difficult and mutilated passage, in which Rawlinson agrees
with Oppert in finding an account of the complete subjection of Sebech
(Sabako?).

(Note: Five Great Monarchies, vol. ii. pp. 416-7; compare Oppert,
Sargonides, pp. 22, 26-7. With regard to one passage of the annals,
which contains an account of a successful battle fought at Ra-bek
(Heliopolis), see Journal Asiat. xii. 462ff.; Brandis, p. 51.)

Nothing can be built upon this, however; and it must also remain
uncertain whether, even if the rest is correctly interpreted, [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md) relates to that conquest of
Ashdod which was followed by the dethroning of the rebellious king and
the appointment of another, or to the final conquest by which it became
a colonial city of Assyria.

(Note: Among the pictures from Khorsabad which have been published by
Botta, there is a burning fortress that has been taken by storm. Isidor
Lwenstern (in his Essai, Paris 1845) pronounced it to be Ashdod; but
Rdiger regarded the evidence as inconclusive. Nevertheless, Lwenstern
was able to claim priority over Rawlinson in several points of
deciphering (Galignani's Messenger, Rev. 28, 1850). He read in the
inscription the king's name, Sarak.)

This conquest Sargon ascribes to himself in person, so that apparently
we must think of that conquest which was carried out by Tartan; and in
that case the words, "he fought against it," etc., need not be taken as
anticipatory. It is quite sufficient, that the monuments seem to
intimate that the conquest of Samaria and Ashdod was followed by the
subjugation of the Egypto-Ethiopian kingdom. But inasmuch as Judah,
trusting in the reed of Egypt, fell away from Assyria under Hezekiah,
and Sennacherib had to make war upon Egypt again, to all appearance the
Assyrians never had much cause to congratulate themselves upon their
possession of Egypt, and that for reasons which are not difficult to
discover. At the time appointed by the prophecy, Egypt came under the
Assyrian yoke, from which it was first delivered by Psammetichus; but,
as the constant wars between Assyria and Egypt clearly show, it never
patiently submitted to that yoke for any length of time. The confidence
which Judah placed in Egypt turned out most disastrously for Judah
itself, just as Isaiah predicted here. But the catastrophe that occurred
in front of Jerusalem did not put an end to Assyria, nor did the
campaigns of Sargon and Sennacherib bring Egypt to an end. And, on the
other hand, the triumphs of Jehovah and of the prophecy concerning
Assyria were not the means of Egypt's conversion. In all these respects
the fulfilment showed that there was an element of human hope in the
prophecy, which made the distant appear to be close at hand. And this
element it eliminated. For the fulfilment of a prophecy is divine, but
the prophecy itself is both divine and human.
