<p>I. Nehemiah's Journey to Jerusalem, and the Restoration of the Walls of Jerusalem - <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001">Neh 1:1</A>
<p>Nehemiah, cup-bearer to King Artaxerxes, is plunged into deep affliction by the account which he receives from certain individuals from Judah of the sad condition of his countrymen who had returned to Jerusalem and Judah. He prays with fasting to the Lord for mercy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001">Neh 1:1-11</A>), and on a favourable opportunity entreats the king and queen for permission to make a journey to Jerusalem, and for the necessary authority to repair its ruined walls. His request being granted, he travels as governor to Jerusalem, provided with letters from the king, and escorted by captains of the army and horsemen (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001">Neh 2:1-10</A>). Soon after his arrival, he surveys the condition of the walls and gates, summons the rulers of the people and the priests to set about building the wall, and in spite of the obstacles he encounters from the enemies of the Jews, accomplishes this work (2:11-6:19). In describing the manner in which the building of the walls was carried on, he first enumerates in succession (3) the individuals and companies engaged in restoring the walls surrounding the city (3), and then relates the obstacles and difficulties encountered (4:1-6:19).

<p>In the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, Nehemiah, being then at Susa, received from one of his brethren, and other individuals from Judah, information which deeply grieved him, concerning the sad condition of the captive who had returned to the land of their fathers, and the state of Jerusalem. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001">Neh 1:1</A> contains the title of the whole book: the History of Nehemiah. By the addition "son of Hachaliah," Nehemiah is distinguished from others of the same name (e.g., from Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#016">Neh 3:16</A>). Another Nehemiah, too, returned from captivity with Zerubbabel, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002">Ezr 2:2</A>. Of Hachaliah we know nothing further, his name occurring but once more, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002">Neh 10:2</A>, in conjunction, as here, with that of Nehemiah. Eusebius and Jerome assert that Nehemiah was of the tribe of Judah, - a statement which may be correct, but is unsupported by any evidence from the Old Testament. According to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011">Neh 1:11</A>, he was cup-bearer to the Persian king, and was, at his own request, appointed for some time Pecha, i.e., governor, of Judah. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014">Neh 5:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026">Neh 12:26</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009">Neh 8:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002">Neh 10:2</A>. "In the month Chisleu of the twentieth year I was in the citadel of Susa" - such is the manner in which Nehemiah commences the narrative of his labours for Jerusalem. Chisleu is the ninth month of the year, answering to our December. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001">Zac 7:1</A>, 1 Macc. 4:52. The twentieth year is, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001">Neh 2:1</A>, the twentieth year of Artaxerxes Longimanus. On the citadel of Susa, see further details in the remarks on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002">Dan 8:2</A>. Susa was the capital of the province Susiana, and its citadel, called by the Greeks Memnoneion, was strongly fortified. The kings of Persia were accustomed to reside here during some months of the year.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002">Neh 1:2-3</A>
<p>There came to Nehemiah Hanani, one of his brethren, and certain men from Judah. &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, one of my brethren, might mean merely a relation of Nehemiah, &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; being often used of more distant relations; but since Nehemiah calls Hanani &#1488;&#1495;&#1497; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#010">Neh 7:10</A>, it is evident that his own brother is meant. "And I asked them concerning the Jews, and concerning Jerusalem." &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is further defined by &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;, who had escaped, who were left from the captivity; those who had returned to Judah are intended, as contrasted with those who still remained in heathen, lands. In the answer, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003">Neh 1:3</A>, they are more precisely designated as being "there in the province (of Judah)." With respect to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, see remarks on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001">Ezr 2:1</A>. They are said to be "in great affliction (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;) and in reproach." Their affliction is more nearly defined by the accessory clause which follows: and the wall = because the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates burned with fire. &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1514;, Pual (the intensive form), broken down, does not necessarily mean that the whole wall was destroyed, but only portions, as appears from the subsequent description of the building of the wall, Neh 3.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004">Neh 1:4</A>
<p>This description of the state of the returned captives plunged Nehemiah into such deep affliction, that he passed some days in mourning, fasting, and prayer. Opinions are divided with respect to the historical relation of the facts mentioned <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003">Neh 1:3</A>. Some older expositors thought that Hanani could not have spoken of the destruction of the walls and gates of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, because this was already sufficiently known to Nehemiah, but of some recent demolition on the part of Samaritans and other hostile neighbours of the Jews; in opposition to which, Rambach simply replies that we are told nothing of a restoration of the wall of Jerusalem by Zerubbabel and Ezra. More recently Ewald (Geschichte, iv. p. 137f.) has endeavoured to show, from certain psalms which he transposes to post-Babylonian times, the probability of a destruction of the rebuilt wall, but gives a decided negative to the question, whether this took place during the thirteen years between the arrivals of Ezra and Nehemiah. "For," says he, "there is not in the whole of Nehemiah's record the most distant hint that the walls had been destroyed only a short time since; but, on the contrary, this destruction was already so remote an event, that its occasion and authors were no longer spoken of." Vaihinger (Theol. Stud. und Krit., 1857, p. 88, comp. 1854, p. 124f.) and Bertheau are of opinion that it indisputably follows from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003">Neh 1:3-4</A>, as appearances show, that the walls of Jerusalem were actually rebuilt and the gates set up before the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, and that the destruction of this laborious work, which occasioned the sending of an embassy to the Persian court, was of quite recent occurrence, since otherwise Nehemiah would not have been so painfully affected by it. But even the very opposite opinion held concerning the impression made upon the reader by these verses, shows that appearances are deceitful, and the view that the destruction of the walls and gates was of quite recent occurrence is not implied by the words themselves, but only inserted in them by expositors. There is no kind of historical evidence that the walls of Jerusalem which had been destroyed by the Chaldeans were once more rebuilt before Nehemiah's arrival.
<p>The documents given by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#008">Ezr 4:8-22</A>, which are in this instance appealed to, so far from proving the fact, rather bear testimony against it. The counsellor Rehum and the scribe Shimshai, in their letter to Artaxerxes, accuse indeed the Jews of building a rebellious and bad city, of restoring its walls and digging its foundations (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012">Ezr 4:12</A>); but they only give the king to understand that if this city be built and its walls restored, the king will no longer have a portion on this side the river (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#016">Ezr 4:16</A>), and hasten to Jerusalem, as soon as they receive the king's decision, to hinder the Jews by force and power (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#023">Ezr 4:23</A>). Now, even if this accusation were quite well founded, nothing further can be inferred from it than that the Jews had begun to restore the walls, but were hindered in the midst of their undertaking. Nothing is said in these documents either of a rebuilding, i.e., a complete restoration, of the walls and setting up of the gates, or of breaking down the walls and burning the gates. It cannot be said that to build a wall means the same as pulling down a wall already built. Nor is anything said in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003">Neh 1:3</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004">Neh 1:4</A> of a recent demolition. The assertion, too, that the destruction of this laborious work was the occasion of the mission of Hanani and certain men of Judah to the Persian court (Vaihinger), is entirely without scriptural support. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002">Neh 1:2</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003">Neh 1:3</A> it is merely said that Hanani and his companions came from Judah to Nehemiah, and that Nehemiah questioned them concerning the condition of the Jews in the province of Judah, and concerning Jerusalem, and that they answered: The Jews there are in great affliction and reproach, for the wall of Jerusalem is broken down (&#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1514; is a participle expressing the state, not the praeter. or perfect, which would be found here if a destruction recently effected were spoken of). Nehemiah, too, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003">Neh 2:3</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#017">Neh 2:17</A>, only says: The city of my fathers' sepulchres (Jerusalem) lieth desolate (&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; is an adjective), not: has been desolated. Nor can a visit on the part of Jews from Judah to their compatriot and relative, the king's cup-bearer, be called a mission to the Persian court. - With respect also to the deep affliction of Nehemiah, upon which Bertheau lays so much stress, it by no means proves that he had received a terrible account of some fresh calamity which had but just befallen the community at Jerusalem, and whose whole extent was as yet unknown to him. Nehemiah had not as yet been to Jerusalem, and could not from his own experience know the state of affairs in Judah and Jerusalem; hence he questioned the newly arrived visitors, not concerning the latest occurrences, but as to the general condition of the returned captives. The fact of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldees could not, of course, be unknown to him; but neither could he be ignorant that now ninety years since a great number of captives had returned to their homes with Zerubbabel and settled in Judah and Jerusalem, and that seventy years since the temple at Jerusalem had been rebuilt. Judging from these facts, he might not have imagined that the state of affairs in Judah and Jerusalem was so bad as it really was. When, then, he now learnt that those who had returned to Judah were in great affliction, that the walls of the town were still lying in ruins and its gates burned, and that it was therefore exposed defenceless to all the insults of hostile neighbours, even this information might well grieve him. It is also probable that it was through Hanani and his companions that he first learnt of the inimical epistle of the royal officials Rehum and Shimshai to Artaxerxes, and of the answer sent thereto by that monarch and thus became for the first time aware of the magnitude of his fellow-countrymen's difficulties. Such intelligence might well be such a shock to him as to cause the amount of distress described <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004">Neh 1:4</A>. For even if he indulged the hope that the king might repeal the decree by which the rebuilding of the wall had been prohibited till further orders, he could not but perceive how difficult it would be effectually to remedy the grievous state in which his countrymen who had returned to the land of their fathers found themselves, while the disposition of their neighbours towards them was thus hostile. This state was indeed sufficiently distressing to cause deep pain to one who had a heart alive to the welfare of his nation, and there is no need for inventing new "calamities," of which history knows nothing, to account for the sorrow of Nehemiah. Finally, the circumstance that the destruction of the walls and burning of the gates are alone mentioned as proofs of the affliction and reproach which the returned exiles were suffering, arises simply from an intention to hint at the remedy about to be described in the narrative which follows, by bringing this special kind of reproach prominently forward.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">neh 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Nehemiah's prayer, as given in these verses, comprises the prayers which he prayed day and night, during the period of his mourning and fasting (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004">Neh 1:4</A> comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#006">Neh 1:6</A>), to his faithful and covenant God, to obtain mercy for his people, and the divine blessing upon his project for their assistance.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#005">Neh 1:5</A>
<p>The invocation of Jahve as: Thou God of heaven, alludes to God's almighty government of the world, and the further predicates of God, to His covenant faithfulness. "Thou great and terrible God" recalls <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021">Deu 7:21</A>, and "who keepest covenant and mercy," etc., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009">Deu 7:9</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005">Exo 20:5-6</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#006">Neh 1:6</A>
<p>"Let Thine ear be attentive, and Thine eyes open," like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#040">Ch2 6:40</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#015">Ch2 7:15</A> - &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, that Thou mayest hearken to the prayer of Thy servant, which I pray, and how I confess concerning ... &#1502;&#1514;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; still depends upon &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in the sense of: and what I confess concerning the sins. &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; does not here mean to-day, but now, at this time, as the addition "day and night" compared with &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004">Neh 1:4</A> shows. To strengthen the communicative form &#1500;&#1498; &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, and to acknowledge before God how deeply penetrated he was by the feeling of his own sin and guilt, he adds: and I and my father's house have sinned.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#007">Neh 1:7</A>
<p>We have dealt very corruptly against Thee. &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; is the inf. constr. instead of the infin. abs., which, before the finite verb, and by reason of its close connection therewith, becomes the infin. constr., like &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021">Psa 50:21</A>; comp. Ewald, 240, c. The dealing corruptly against God consists in not having kept the commandments, statutes, and judgments of the law.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#008">Neh 1:8-10</A>
<p>With his confession of grievous transgression, Nehemiah combines the petition that the Lord would be mindful of His word declared by Moses, that if His people, whom He had scattered among the heathen for their sins, should turn to Him and keep His commandments, He would gather them from all places where He had scattered them, and bring them back to the place which He had chosen to place His name there. This word (&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;) he designates, as that which God had commanded to His servant Moses, inasmuch as it formed a part of that covenant law which was prescribed to the Israelites as their rule of life. The matter of this word is introduced by &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;: ye transgress, I will scatter; i.e., if ye transgress by revolting from me, I will scatter you among the nations, - and ye turn to me and keep my commandments (i.e., if ye turn to me and ... ), if there were of you cast out to the end of heaven (i.e., to the most distant regions where the end of heaven touches the earth), thence will I gather you, etc. &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;, pat. Niphal, with a collective meaning, cast-out ones, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#004">Deu 30:4</A>. These words are no verbal quotation, but a free summary, in which Nehemiah had <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001">Deu 30:1-5</A> chiefly in view, of what God had proclaimed in the law of Moses concerning the dispersion of His people among the heathen if they sinned against Him, and of their return to the land of their fathers if they repented and turned to Him. The clause: if the cast-out ones were at the end of heaven, etc., stands verbally in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004">Neh 1:4</A>. The last words, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#009">Neh 1:9</A>, "(I will bring them) to the place which I have chosen, that my name may dwell there," are a special application of the general promise of the law to the present case. Jerusalem is meant, where the Lord caused His name to dwell in the temple; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011">Deu 12:11</A>. The entreaty to remember this word and to fulfil it, seems ill adapted to existing circumstances, for a portion of the people were already brought back to Jerusalem; and Nehemiah's immediate purpose was to pray, not for the return of those still sojourning among the heathen, but for the removal of the affliction and reproach resting on those who were now at Jerusalem. Still less appropriate seems the citation of the words: If ye transgress, I will scatter you among the nations. It must, however, be remembered that Nehemiah is not so much invoking the divine compassion as the righteousness and faithfulness of a covenant God, the great and terrible God that keepeth covenant and mercy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#005">Neh 1:5</A>). Now this, God had shown Himself to be, by fulfilling the threats of His law that He would scatter His faithless and transgressing people among the nations. Thus His fulfilment of this one side of the covenant strengthened the hope that God would also keep His other covenant word to His people who turned to Him, viz., that He would bring them again to the land of their fathers, to the place of His gracious presence. Hence the reference to the dispersion of the nation among the heathen, forms the actual substructure for the request that so much of the promise as yet remained unfulfilled might come to pass. Nehemiah, moreover, views this promise in the full depth of its import, as securing to Israel not merely an external return to their native land, but their restoration as a community, in the midst of whom the Lord had His dwelling, and manifested Himself as the defence and refuge of His people. To the re-establishment of this covenant relation very much was still wanting. Those who had returned from captivity had indeed settled in the land of their fathers; and the temple in which they might worship God with sacrifices, according to the law, was rebuilt at Jerusalem. But notwithstanding all this, Jerusalem, with its ruined walls and burned gates, was still like a city lying waste, and exposed to attacks of all kinds; while the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah were loaded with shame and contempt by their heathen neighbours. In this sense, Jerusalem was not yet restored, and the community dwelling therein not yet brought to the place where the name of the Lord dwelt. In this respect, the promise that Jahve would again manifest Himself to His repentant people as the God of the covenant was still unfulfilled, and the petition that He would gather His people to the place which He had chosen to put His name there, i.e., to manifest Himself according to His nature, as testified in His covenant (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006">Exo 34:6-7</A>), quite justifiable. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#010">Neh 1:10</A> Nehemiah supports his petition by the words: And these (now dwelling in Judah and Jerusalem) are Thy servants and Thy people whom Thou hast redeemed, etc. His servants who worship Him in His temple, His people whom He has redeemed from Egypt by His great power and by His strong arm, God cannot leave in affliction and reproach. The words: "redeemed with great power" ... are reminiscences from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008">Deu 7:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#026">Deu 9:26</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#029">Deu 9:29</A>, and other passages in the Pentateuch, and refer to the deliverance from Egypt.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011">Neh 1:11</A>
<p>The prayer closes with the reiterated entreaty that God would hearken to the prayer of His servant (i.e., Nehemiah), and to the prayer of His servants who delight to fear His name (&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, infin. like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010">Deu 4:10</A> and elsewhere), i.e., of all Israelites who, like Nehemiah, prayed to God to redeem Israel from all his troubles. For himself in particular, Nehemiah also request: "Prosper Thy servant to-day (&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#006">Neh 1:6</A>; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; may be either the accusative of the person, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005">Ch2 26:5</A>, or the dative: Prosper his design unto Thy servant, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#020">Neh 2:20</A>), and give him to mercy (i.e., cause him to find mercy; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#050">Kg1 8:50</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046">Psa 106:46</A>) before the face of this man." What man he means is explained by the following supplementary remark, "And I was cup-bearer to the king," without whose favour and permission Nehemiah could not have carried his project into execution (as related in Neh 2).
