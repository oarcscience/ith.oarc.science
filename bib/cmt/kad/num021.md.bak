### [Numbers Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 21:1</span></span>

Victory of Israel over the Canaanitish King of Arad. - When this
Canaanitish king, who dwelt in the Negeb, i.e., the south of Palestine
(vid., [Num 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017).md), heard that Israel
was coming the way of the spies, he made war upon the Israelites, and
took some of them prisoners. Arad is mentioned both here and in the
parallel passage, [Num 33:40](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#040.md), and also
by the side of Hormah, in [Jos 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#014.md),
as the seat of a Canaanitish king (cf. [Jdg
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016).md). According to Eusebius and
Jerome in the Onomast., it was twenty Roman miles to the south of
Hebron, and has been preserved in the ruins of Tell Arad, which v.
Schubert (ii. pp. 457ff.) and Robinson (ii. pp. 473, 620, and 624) saw
in the distance; and, according to Roth in Petermann's geographische
Mittheilungen (1858, p. 269), it was situated to the south-east of
Kurmul (Carmel), in an undulating plain, without trees or shrubs, with
isolated hills and ranges of hills in all directions, among which was
Tell Arad. The meaning of האתרים שדרך is uncertain. The lxx, Saad., and
others, take the word Atharim as the proper name of a place not
mentioned again; but the Chaldee, Samar., and Syr. render it with much
greater probability as an appellative noun formed from תּוּר with א
prosthet., and synonymous with התּרים, the spies ([Num
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006).md). The way of the spies was the
way through the desert of Zin, which the Israelitish spies had
previously taken to Canaan ([Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021).md). The territory of the king of
Arad extended to the southern frontier of Canaan, to the desert of Zin,
through which the Israelites went from Kadesh to Mount Hor. The
Canaanites attacked them when upon their march, and made some of them
prisoners.

[Num 21:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#002.md)

The Israelites then vowed to the Lord, that if He would give this people
into their hands, they would "ban" their cities; and the Lord hearkened
to the request, and delivered up the Canaanites, so that they put them
and their cities under the ban. (On the ban, see at [Lev
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028).md). "And they called the place
Hormah," i.e., banning, ban-place. "The place" can only mean the spot
where the Canaanites were defeated by the Israelites. If the town of
Zephath, or the capital of Arad, had been specially intended, it would
no doubt have been also mentioned, as in [Jdg
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017.md). As it was not the intention of
Moses to press into Canaan from the south, across the steep and
difficult mountains, for the purpose of effecting its conquest, the
Israelites could very well content themselves for the present with the
defeat inflicted upon the Canaanites, and defer the complete execution
of their vow until the time when they had gained a firm footing in
Canaan. The banning of the Canaanites of Arad and its cities necessarily
presupposed the immediate conquest of the whole territory, and the
laying of all its cities in ashes. And so, again, the introduction of a
king of Hormah, i.e., Zephath, among the kings defeated by Joshua ([Jos
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#014).md), is no proof that Zephath was
conquered and called Hormah in the time of Moses. Zephath may be called
Hormah proleptically both there and in [Jos
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#004.md), as being the southernmost border
town of the kingdom of Arad, in consequence of the ban suspended by
Moses over the territory of the king of Arad, and may not have received
this name till after its conquest by the Judaeans and Simeonites. At the
same time, it is quite conceivable that Zephath may have been captured
in the time of Joshua, along with the other towns of the south, and
called Hormah at that time, but that the Israelites could not hold it
then; and therefore, after the departure of the Israelitish army, the
old name was restored by the Canaanites, or rather only retained, until
the city was retaken and permanently held by the Israelites after
Joshua's death ([Jdg 1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016).md), and
received the new name once for all. The allusion to Hormah here, and in
[Num 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045.md), does not warrant the
opinion in any case, that it was subsequently to the death of Moses and
the conquest of Canaan under Joshua that the war with the Canaanites of
Arad and their overthrow occurred.

[Numbers 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 21:4</span></span>

March of Israel through the Arabah. Plague of Serpents, and Brazen
Serpent. - [Num 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004.md). As the Edomites
refused a passage through their land when the Israelites left Mount Hor,
they were obliged to take the way to the Red Sea, in order to go round
the land of Edom, that is to say, to go down the Arabah to the head of
the Elanitic Gulf.

[Num 21:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005.md)

As they went along this road the people became impatient ("the soul of
the people was much discouraged," see [Exo
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009).md), and they began once more to
murmur against God and Moses, because they had neither bread nor water
(cf. [Num 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#004)..md), and were tired of
the loose, i.e., poor, food of manna (קלקל from קלל). The low-lying
plain of the Arabah, which runs between steep mountain walls from the
Dead Sea to the Red Sea, would be most likely to furnish the Israelites
with very little food, except the manna which God gave them; for
although it is not altogether destitute of vegetation, especially at the
mouths of the wadys and winter torrents from the hills, yet on the whole
it is a horrible desert, with a loose sandy soil, and drifts of granite
and other stones, where terrible sand-storms sometimes arise from the
neighbourhood of the Red Sea (see v. Schubert, R. ii. pp. 396ff., and
Ritter, Erdk. xiv. pp. 1013ff.); and the want of food might very
frequently be accompanied by the absence of drinkable water. The people
rebelled in consequence, and were punished by the Lord with fiery
serpents, the bite of which caused many to die. שׂרפים נחשׁים, lit.,
burning snakes, so called from their burning, i.e., inflammatory bite,
which filled with heat and poison, just as many of the snakes were
called by the Greeks, e.g., the ́ ͂, and καύσωνες (Dioscor. vii. 13:
Aelian. nat. anim. vi. 51), not from the skin of these snakes with fiery
red spots, which are frequently found in the Arabah, and are very
poisonous.

(Note: This is the account given by v. Schubert, R. ii. p. 406: "In the
afternoon they brought us a very mottled snake of a large size, marked
with fiery red spots and wavy stripes, which belonged to the most
poisonous species, as the formation of its teeth clearly showed.
According to the assertion of the Bedouins, these snakes, which they
greatly dreaded, were very common in that neighbourhood.")

[Num 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#007.md)

This punishment brought the people to reflection. They confessed their
sin to Moses, and entreated him to deliver them from the plague through
his intercession with the Lord. And the Lord helped them; in such a way,
however, that the reception of help was made to depend upon the faith of
the people.

[Num 21:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#008.md)

At the command of God, Moses made a brazen serpent, and put it upon a
standard.

(Note: For the different views held by early writers concerning the
brazen serpent, see Buxtorf, historia serp. aen., in his Exercitt. pp.
458ff.; Deyling, observatt. ss. ii. obs. 15, pp. 156ff.; Vitringa,
observ. ss. 1, pp. 403ff.; Jo. Marck, Scripturariae Exercitt. exerc. 8,
pp. 465ff.; Iluth, Serpens exaltatus non contritoris sed conterendi
imago, Erl. 1758; Gottfr. Menken on the brazen serpent; Sack,
Apologetick, 2 Ausg. pp. 355ff. Hoffmann, Weissagung u. Erfllung, ii.
pp. 142, 143; Kurtz, History of the Old Covenant, iii. 345ff.; and the
commentators on [Joh 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014.md) and [Joh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#015)..md)

Whoever then of the persons bitten by the poisonous serpents looked at
the brazen serpent with faith in the promise of God, lived, i.e.,
recovered from the serpent's bite. The serpent was to be made of brass
or copper, because the colour of this metal, when the sun was shining
upon it, was most like the appearance of the fiery serpents; and thus
the symbol would be more like the thing itself.

Even in the book of Wis. ([Num
16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#006).md), the brazen serpent is called
"a symbol of salvation; for he that turned himself toward it was not
saved by the thing that he saw, but by Thee, that art the Saviour of
all." It was not merely intended, however, as Ewald supposes (Gesch. ii.
p. 228), as a "sign that just as this serpent hung suspended in the air,
bound and rendered harmless by the command of Jehovah, so every one who
looked at this with faith in the redeeming power of Jehovah, was secured
against the evil, - a figurative sign, therefore, like that of St.
George and the Dragon among ourselves;" for, according to this, there
would be no internal causal link between the fiery serpents and the
brazen image of a serpent. It was rather intended as a figurative
representation of the poisonous serpents, rendered harmless by the mercy
of God. For God did not cause a real serpent to be taken, but the image
of a serpent, in which the fiery serpent was stiffened, as it were, into
dead brass, as a sign that the deadly poison of the fiery serpents was
overcome in this brazen serpent. This is not to be regarded as a symbol
of the divine healing power; nor is the selection of such a symbol to be
deduced and explained, as it is by Winer, Kurtz, Knobel, and others,
from the symbolical view that was common to all the heathen religions of
antiquity, that the serpent was a beneficent and health-bringing power,
which led to its being exalted into a symbol of the healing power, and a
representation of the gods of healing. This heathen view is not only
foreign to the Old Testament, and without any foundation in the fact
that, in the time of Hezekiah, the people paid a superstitious worship
to the brazen serpent erected by Moses ([Kg2
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004).md); but it is irreconcilably
opposed to the biblical view of the serpent, as the representative of
evil, which was founded upon [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md), and is only traceable to the
magical art of serpent-charming, which the Old Testament abhorred as an
idolatrous abomination. To this we may add, that the thought which lies
at the foundation of this explanation, viz., that poison is to be cured
by poison, has no support in [Hos
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004.md), but is altogether foreign to the
Scriptures. God punishes sin, it is true, by sin; but He neither cures
sin by sin, nor death by death. On the contrary, to conquer sin it was
necessary that the Redeemer should be without sin; and to take away its
power from death, it was requisite that Christ, the Prince of life, who
had life in Himself, should rise again from death and the grave ([Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md); [Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025.md); [Act
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015.md); [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010).md).

The brazen serpent became a symbol of salvation on the three grounds
which Luther pointed out. In the first place, the serpent which Moses
was to make by the command of God was to be of brass or copper, that is
to say, of a reddish colour, and (although without poison) altogether
like the persons who were red and burning with heat because of the bite
of the fiery serpents. In the second place, the brazen serpent was to be
set up upon a pole for a sign. And in the third place, those who desired
to recover from the fiery serpent's bite and live, were to look at the
brazen serpent upon the pole, otherwise they could not recover or live
(Luther's Sermon on [Joh 3:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001).md). It
was in these three points, as Luther has also clearly shown, that the
typical character of this symbol lay, to which Christ referred in His
conversation with Nicodemus ([Joh
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014).md). The brazen serpent had the form
of a real serpent, but was "without poison, and altogether harmless." So
God sent His Son in the form of sinful flesh, and yet without sin ([Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md); [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md); [Pe1
2:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022).md). - 2. In the lifting up of
the serpent as a standard. This was a δειγματίζειν ἐν παρρησίᾳ, a ́ (a
"showing openly," or "triumphing"), a triumphal exhibition of the
poisonous serpents as put to death in the brazen image, just as the
lifting up of Christ upon the cross was a public triumph over the evil
principalities and powers below the sky ([Col
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014).md). - 3. In the cure effected
through looking at the image of the serpent. Just as the Israelites had
to turn their eyes to the brazen serpent in believing obedience to the
word of the Lord, in order to be cured of the bite of the poisonous
serpents, so much we look with faith at the Son of man lifted up upon
the cross, if we would be delivered from the bite of the old serpent,
from sin, death, the devil, and hell. "Christ is the antitype of the
serpent, inasmuch as He took upon Himself the most pernicious of all
pernicious potencies, viz., sin, and made a vicarious atonement for it"
(Hengstenberg on [Joh 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014).md). The
brazen image of the serpent was taken by the Israelites to Canaan, and
preserved till the time of Hezekiah, who had it broken in pieces,
because the idolatrous people had presented incense-offerings to this
holy relic ([Kg2 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004).md).

[Numbers 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 21:10</span></span>

March of Israel round Edom and Moab, to the Heights of Pisgah in the
Field of Moab (cf. [Num 33:41-47](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#041).md). -
[Num 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#010.md). From the camp in the
Arabah, which is not more particularly described, where the murmuring
people were punished by fiery serpents, Israel removed to Oboth.
According to the list of stations in [Num
33:41](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#041.md)., they went from Hor to
Zalmonah, the situation of which has not been determined; for C. v.
Raumer's conjecture (der Zug der Israeliten, p. 45), that it was the
same place as the modern Maan, has no firm basis in the fact that Maan
is a station of the Syrian pilgrim caravans. From Zalmonah they went to
Phunon, and only then to Oboth. The name Phunon is no doubt the same as
Phinon, a tribe-seat of the Edomitish Phylarch ([Gen
36:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#041).md); and according to Jerome (Onom.
s. v. Fenon), it was "a little village in the desert, where copper was
dug up by condemned criminals (see at [Gen
36:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#041).md), between Petra and Zoar." This
statement suits very well, provided we imagine the situation of Phunon
to have been not in a straight line between Petra and Zoar, but more to
the east, between the mountains on the edge of the desert. For the
Israelites unquestionably went from the southern end of the Arabah to
the eastern side of Idumaea, through the Wady el Ithm (Getum), which
opens into the Arabah from the east, a few hours to the north of Akaba
and the ancient Ezion-geber. They had then gone round the mountains of
Edom, and begun to "turn to the north" ([Deu
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#003).md), so that they now proceeded
farther northwards, on the eastern side of the mountains of Edom,
"through the territory of the sons of Esau," no doubt by the same road
which is taken in the present day by the caravans which go from Gaza to
Maan, through the Ghor. "This runs upon a grassy ridge, forming the
western border of the coast of Arabia, and the eastern border of the
cultivated land, which stretches from the land of Edom to the sources of
the Jordan, on the eastern side of the Ghor" (v. Raumer, Zug, p. 45). On
the western side of their mountains the Edomites had refused permission
to the Israelites to pass through their land ([Num
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#018)..md), as the mountains of Seir
terminate towards the Ghor (the Arabah) in steep and lofty precipices,
and there are only two or three narrow wadys which intersect them from
west to east; and of these the Wady Ghuweir is the only one which is
practicable for an army, and even this could be held so securely by a
moderate army, that no enemy could force its way into the heart of the
country (see Leake in Burckhardt, pp. 21, 22; and Robinson, ii. p. 583).
It was different on the eastern side, where the mountains slope off into
a wide extent of table-land, which is only slightly elevated above the
desert of Arabia. Here, on the weaker side of their frontier, the
Edomites lost the heart to make any attack upon the Israelites, who
would now have been able to requite their hostilities. But the Lord had
commanded Israel not to make war upon the sons of Esau; but when passing
through their territory, to purchase food and water from them for money
([Deu 2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004).md). The Edomites submitted
to the necessity, and endeavoured to take advantage of it, by selling
provisions, "in the same way in which, at the present day, the caravan
from Mecca is supplied with provisions by the inhabitants of the
mountains along the pilgrim road" (Leake in Burckhardt, p. 24). The
situation of Oboth cannot be determined.

[Num 21:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#011.md)

The next encampment was "Ije-Abarim in the desert, which lies before
Moab towards the sun-rising," i.e., on the eastern border of Moabitis
([Num 33:44](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#044).md). As the Wady el Ahsy,
which runs into the Dead Sea, in a deep and narrow rocky bed, from the
south-east, and is called el Kerahy in its lower part (Burckhardt, Syr.
pp. 673-4), separates Idumaea from Moabitis; Ije-Abarim (i.e., ruins of
the crossings over) must be sought for on the border of Moab to the
north of this wady, but is hardly to be found, as Knobel supposes, on
the range of hills called el Tarfuye, which is known by the name of
Orokaraye, still farther to the south, and terminates on the south-west
of Kerek, whilst towards the north it is continued in the range of hills
called el Ghoweithe and the mountain range of el Zoble; even supposing
that the term Abarim, "the passages or sides," is to be understood as
referring to these ranges of hills and mountains which skirt the land of
the Amorites and Moabites, and form the enclosing sides. For the
boundary line between the hills of el-Tarfuye and those of el-Ghoweithe
is so near to the Arnon, that there is not the necessary space between
it and the Arnon for the encampment at the brook Zared ([Num
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#012).md). Ije-Abarim or Jim cannot have
been far from the northern shore of the el Ahsy, and was probably in the
neighbourhood of Kalaat el Hassa (Ahsa), the source of the Ahsy, and a
station for the pilgrim caravans (Burckhardt, p. 1035). As the Moabites
were also not to be attacked by the Israelites ([Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009)..md), they passed along the eastern
border of Moabitis as far as the brook Zared ([Num
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#012).md). This can hardly have been the
Wady el-Ahsy (Robinson, ii. p. 555; Ewald, Gesch. ii. p. 259; Ritter,
Erdk. xv. p. 689); for that must already have been crossed when they
came to the border of Moab ([Num
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#011).md). Nor can it well have been "the
brook Zaide, which runs from the south-east, passes between the mountain
ranges of Ghoweithe and Tarfuye, and enters the Arnon, of which it forms
the leading source," - the view adopted by Knobel, on the very
questionable ground that the name is a corruption of Zared. In all
probability it was the Wady Kerek, in the upper part of its course, not
far from Katrane, on the pilgrim road (v. Raumer, Zug, p. 47: Kurtz, and
others).

[Num 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013.md)

The next encampment was "beyond (i.e., by the side of) the Arnon, which
is in the desert, and that cometh out of the territory of the Amorites."
The Arnon, i.e., the present Wady Mojeb, is formed by the union of the
Seyl (i.e., brook or river) Sade, which comes from the south-east, not
far from Katrane, on the pilgrim road, and the Lejum from the
north-east, which receives the small rivers el Makhreys and Balua, the
latter flowing from the pilgrim station Kalaat Balua, and then continues
its course to the Dead Sea, through a deep and narrow valley, shut in by
very steep and lofty cliffs, and covered with blocks of stone, that have
been brought down from the loftier ground (Burckhardt, pp. 633ff.), so
that there are only a few places where it is passable; and consequently
a wandering people like the Israelites could not have crossed the Mojeb
itself to force an entrance into the territory of the hostile Amorites.

(Note: It is utterly inconceivable that a whole people, travelling with
all their possessions as well as with their flocks, should have been
exposed without necessity to the dangers and enormous difficulties that
would attend the crossing of so dreadfully wild and so deep a valley,
and that merely for the purpose of forcing an entrance into an enemy's
country. - Ritter, Erdk. xv. p. 1207.)

For the Arnon formed the boundary between Moab and the country of the
Amorites. The spot where Israel encamped on the Arnon must be sought for
in the upper part of its course, where it is still flowing "in the
desert;" not at Wady Zade, however, although Burckhardt calls this the
main source of the Mojeb, but at the Balua, which flows into the Lejum.
In all probability these streams, of which the Lejum came from the
north, already bore the name of Arnon; as we may gather from the
expression, "that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites." The place
of Israel's encampment, "beyond the Arnon in the desert," is to be
sought for, therefore, in the neighbourhood of Kalaat Balua, and on the
south side of the Arnon (Balua). This is evident enough from [Deu
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024.md), [Deu
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026.md)., where the Israelites are
represented as entering the territory of the Amoritish king Sihon, when
they crossed the Arnon, having first of all sent a deputation, with a
peaceable request for permission to pass through his land (cf. [Num
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021)..md). Although this took place,
according to [Deu 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026.md), "out of the
wilderness of Kedemoth," an Amoritish town, it by no means follows that
the Israelites had already crossed the Arnon and entered the territory
of the Amorites, but only that they were standing on the border of it,
and in the desert which took its name from Kedemoth, and ran up to this,
the most easterly town, as the name seems to imply, of the country of
the Amorites. After the conquest of the country, Kedemoth was allotted
to the Reubenites ([Jos 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018).md), and
made into a Levitical city ([Jos
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#037.md); [Ch1
6:64](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#064).md).

The Israelites now received instructions from the Lord, to cross the
river Arnon, and make war upon the Amoritish king Sihon of Heshbon, and
take possession of his land, with the assurance that the Lord had given
Sihon into the hand of Israel, and would fill all nations before them
with fear and trembling ([Deu
2:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024).md). This summons, with its
attendant promises, not only filled the Israelites with courage and
strength to enter upon the conflict with the mightiest of all the tribes
of the Canaanites, but inspired poets in the midst of them to
commemorate in odes the wars of Jehovah, and His victories over His
foes. A few verses are given here out of one of these odes ([Deu
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#014)..md), not for the purpose of
verifying the geographical statement, that the Arnon touches the border
of Moabitis, or that the Israelites had only arrived at the border of
the Moabite and Amorite territory, but as an evidence that there, on the
borders of Moab, the Israelites had been inspired through the divine
promises with the firm assurance that they should be able to conquer the
land of the Amorites which lay before them.

[Num 21:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014.md)

"Therefore," sc., because the Lord had thus given king Sihon, with all
his land, into the hand of Israel, "it is written in the book of the
wars of the Lord: Vaheb (Jehovah takes) in storm, and the brooks of
Arnon and the valley of the brooks, which turns to the dwelling of Ar,
and leans upon the border of Moab." The book of the wars of Jehovah is
neither an Amoritish book of the conflicts of Baal, in which the warlike
feats performed by Sihon and other Amoritish heroes with the help of
Baal were celebrated in verse, as G. Unruh fabulously asserts in his Zug
der Isr. aus Aeg. nach Canaan (p. 130), nor a work "dating from the time
of Jehoshaphat, containing the early history of the Israelites, from the
Hebrew patriarchs till past the time of Joshua, with the law
interwoven," which is the character that Knobel's critical fancy would
stamp upon it, but a collection of odes of the time of Moses himself, in
celebration of the glorious acts of the Lord to and for the Israelites;
and "the quotation bears the same relation to the history itself, as the
verses of Krner would bear to the writings of any historian of the wars
of freedom, who had himself taken part in these wars, and introduced the
verses into his own historical work" (Hengstenberg).

(Note: "That such a book should arise in the last days of Moses, when
the youthful generation began for the first time to regard and manifest
itself, both vigorously and generally, as the army of Jehovah, is so far
from being a surprising fact, that we can scarcely imagine a more
suitable time for the commencement of such a work" (Baumgarten). And if
this is the case, the allusion to this collection of odes cannot be
adduced as an argument against the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch,
since Moses certainly did not write out the history of the journey from
Kadesh to the Arboth Moab until after the two kings of the Amorites had
been defeated, and the land to the east of the Jordan conquered, or till
the Israelites had encamped in the steppes of Moab, opposite to
Jericho.)

The strophe selected from the ode has neither subject nor verb in it, as
the ode was well known to the contemporaries, and what had to be
supplied could easily be gathered from the title, "Wars of Jehovah."
Vaheb is no doubt the proper name of an Amoritish fortress; and בּסוּפה,
"in storm," is to be explained according to [Nah
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003.md), "The Lord, in the storm is His
way." "Advancing in storm, He took Vaheb and the brooks of Arnon," i.e.,
the different wadys, valleys cut by brooks, which open into the Arnon.
הנּחלים אשׁד, lit., pouring of the brooks, from אשׁד, effusio, the
pouring, then the place where brooks pour down, the slope of mountains
or hills, for which the term אשׁדה is generally used in the plural,
particularly to denote the slopes of the mountains of Pisgah ([Deu
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017.md); [Deu
4:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#049.md); [Jos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003.md); [Jos
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#020).md), and the hilly region of
Palestine, which formed the transition from the mountains to the plain
([Jos 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040.md) and [Jos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#008).md). שׁבת, the dwelling, used
poetically for the dwelling-place, as in [Sa2
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#007.md) and [Oba
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003). ער (Ar.md), the antiquated form for
עיר, a city, is the same as Ar Moab in [Num
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028.md) and [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md), "the city of Moab, on the border
of the Arnon, which is at the end of the (Moabitish) territory" ([Num
22:36](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#036).md). It was called Areopolis by the
Greeks, and was near to Aror ([Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md) and [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009).md), probably standing at the
confluence of the Lejum and Mojeb, in the "fine green pasture land, in
the midst of which there is a hill with some ruins," and not far away
the ruin of a small castle, with a heap of broken columns (Burckhardt,
Syr. p. 636). This Ar is not to be identified with the modern Rabba, in
the midst of the land of the Moabites, six hours to the south of Lejum,
to which the name Areopolis was transferred in the patristic age,
probably after the destruction of Ar, the ancient Areopolis, by an
earthquake, of which Jerome gives an account in connection with his own
childhood (see his Com. on [Isa
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001).md), possibly the earthquake which
occurred in the year a.d. 342, and by which many cities of the East were
destroyed, and among others Nicomedia (cf. Hengstenberg, Balaam, pp.
525-528; Ritter, Erdkunde, xv. pp. 1212ff.; and v. Raumer, Palstina, pp.
270, 271, Ed. 4).

[Num 21:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016.md)

They proceeded thence to Beer (a well), a place of encampment which
received its name from the fact that here God gave the people water, not
as before by a miraculous supply from a rock, but by commanding wells to
be dug. This is evident from the ode with which the congregation
commemorated this divine gift of grace. "Then Israel sang this song:
Spring up, O well! Sing ye to it! Well which princes dug, which the
nobles of the people hollowed out, with the sceptre, with their staves."
ענה, as in [Exo 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#021.md) and [Exo
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#018.md). מחקק, ruler's staff, cf. [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md). Beer, probably the same as Beer
Elim ([Isa 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008).md), on the north-east of
Moab, was in the desert; for the Israelites proceeded thence "from the
desert to Mattanah" ([Num 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#018).md),
thence to Nahaliel, and thence to Bamoth. According to Eusebius (cf.
Reland, Pal. ill. p. 495), Mattanah (Μαθθανέμ) was by the valley of the
Arnon, twelve Roman miles to the east (or more properly south-east or
south) of Medabah, and is probably to be seen in Tedun, a place now
lying in ruins, near the source of the Lejum (Burckhardt, pp. 635, 636;
Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 530; Knobel, and others). The name of Nahaliel
is still retained in the form Encheileh. This is the name given to the
Lejum, after it has been joined by the Balua, until its junction with
the Saide (Burckhardt, p. 635). Consequently the Israelites went from
Beer in the desert, in a north-westerly direction to Tedun, then
westwards to the northern bank of the Encheileh, and then still farther
in a north-westerly and northerly direction to Bamoth. There can be no
doubt that Bamoth is identical with Bamoth Baal, i.e., heights of Baal
([Num 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004).md). According to [Jos
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017.md) (cf. [Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002).md), Bamoth was near to Dibon
(Dibn), between the Wady Wale and Wady Mojeb, and also to Beth-Baal
Meon, i.e., Myun, half a German mile (2 1/2 English) to the south of
Heshbon; and, according to [Num 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041.md),
you could see Bamoth Baal from the extremity of the Israelitish camp in
the steppes of Moab. Consequently Bamoth cannot be the mountain to the
south of Wady Wale, upon the top of which Burckhardt says there is a
very beautiful plain (p. 632; see Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 532); because
the steppes of Moab cannot be seen at all from this plain, as they are
covered by the Jebel Attarus. It is rather a height upon the long
mountain Attarus, which runs along the southern shore of the Zerka
Maein, and may possibly be a spot upon the summit of the Jebel Attarus,
"the highest point in the neighbourhood," upon which, according to
Burckhardt (p. 630), there is "a heap of stones overshadowed by a very
large pistachio-tree." A little farther down to the south-west of this
lies the fallen town Kereijat (called Krriat by Seetzen, ii. p. 342),
i.e., Kerioth, [Jer 48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024.md); [Amo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002.md).

[Num 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020.md)

From Bamoth they proceeded "to the valley, which (is) in the field of
Moab, upon the top of Pisgah, and looks across the face of the desert."
הפּסנּה ראשׁ, head, or height of the Pisgah, is in apposition to the
field of Moab. The "field of Moab" was a portion of the table-land which
stretches from Rabbath Ammn to the Arnon, which "is perfectly treeless
for an immense distance in one part (viz., the neighbourhood of Eleale),
but covered over with the ruins of towns that have been destroyed," and
which "extends to the desert of Arabia towards the east, and slopes off
to the Jordan and the Dead Sea towards the west" (v. Raumer, Pal. p.
71). It is identical with "the whole plain from Medeba to Dibon" ([Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009).md), and "the whole plain by Medeba"
([Num 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016).md), in which Heshbon and its
cities were situated ([Num 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#017.md); cf.
[Num 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021.md) and [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010).md). The valley in this tableland
was upon the height of Pisgah, i.e., the northern part of the mountains
of Abarim, and looked across the surface of the desert. Jeshimon, the
desert, is the plain of Ghor el Belka, i.e., the valley of desolation on
the north-eastern border of the Dead Sea, which stretches from the Wady
Menshalla or Wady Ghuweir (el Guer) to the small brook el Szume (Wady es
Suweimeh on Van de Velde's map) at the Dead Sea, and narrows it more and
more at the northern extremity on this side. "Ghor el Belka consists in
part of a barren, salt, and stony soil; though there are some portions
which can be cultivated. To the north of the brook el Szume, the great
plain of the Jordan begins, which is utterly without fertility till you
reach the Nahr Hesbn, about two hours distant, and produces nothing but
bitter, salt herbs for camels" (Seetzen, ii. pp. 373, 374), and which
was probably reckoned as part of Jeshimon, since Beth-jeshimoth was
situated within it (see at [Num
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028).md). The valley in which the
Israelites were encamped in the field of Moab upon the top of Pisgah, is
therefore to be sought for to the west of Heshbon, on the mountain range
of Abarim, which slopes off into the Ghor el Belka. From this the
Israelites advanced into the Arboth Moab (see [Num
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001).md).

If we compare the places of encampment named in [Num
21:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#011.md) with the list of stations in
[Num 33:41-49](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#041.md), we find, instead of the
seven places, mentioned here between Ijje Abarim and the Arboth
Moab,-viz., Brook Zared, on the other side of the Arnon in the desert,
Beer, Mattana, Nahaliel, Bamoth, and the valley in the field of Moab
upon the top of Pisgah-only three places given, viz., Dibon of Gad,
Almon Diblathaim, and Mount Abarim before Nebo. That the last of these
is only another name for the valley in the field of Moab upon the top of
Pisgah, is undoubtedly proved by the fact that, according to [Deu
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md) (cf. [Num
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027).md), Mount Nebo was a peak of
Pisgah, and that it was situated, according to [Deu
32:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#049.md), upon the mountains of Abarim,
from which it is evident at once that the Pisgah was a portion of the
mountains of Abarim, and in fact the northern portion opposite to
Jericho (see at [Num 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012).md). The two
other differences in the names may be explained from the circumstance
that the space occupied by the encampment of the Israelites, an army of
600,000 men, with their wives, children, and cattle, when once they
reached the inhabited country with its towns and villages, where every
spot had its own fixed name, must have extended over several places, so
that the very same encampment might be called by one or other of the
places upon which it touched. If Dibon Gad ([Num
33:45](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#045).md) was the Dibon built (i.e.,
rebuilt or fortified) by the Gadites after the conquest of the land
([Num 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#003.md), [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034).md), and allotted to the Reubenites
([Jos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md), [Jos
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017).md), which is still traceable in
the ruins of Dibn, an hour to the north of the Arnon (v. Raumer, Pal. p.
261), (and there is no reason to doubt it), then the place of
encampment, Nahaliel (Encheile), was identical with Dibon of Gad, and
was placed after this town in [Num
33:45](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#045.md), because the camp of the
Israelites extended as far as Dibon along the northern bank of that
river. Almon Diblathaim also stands in the same relation to Bamoth. The
two places do not appear to have been far from one another; for Almon
Diblathaim is probably identical with Beth Diblathaim, which is
mentioned in [Jer 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#022.md) along with
Dibon, Nebo, and other Moabite towns, and is to be sought for to the
north or north-west of Dibon. For, according to Jerome (Onom. s. v.
Jassa), Jahza was between Medaba and Deblatai, for which Eusebius has
written Δηβούς by mistake for Διβών; Eusebius having determined the
relative position of Jahza according to a more southerly place, Jerome
according to one farther north. The camp of the Israelites therefore may
easily have extended from Almon or Beth-diblathaim to Bamoth, and might
very well take its name from either place.

(Note: Neither this difference in the names of the places of encampment,
nor the material diversity, - viz., that in the chapter before us there
are four places more introduced than in Num 33, whereas in every other
case the list in Num 33 contains a larger number of stations than we
read of in the historical account-at all warrants the hypothesis, that
the present chapter is founded upon a different document from Num 33.
For they may be explained in a very simple manner, as Kurtz has most
conclusively demonstrated (vol. iii. pp. 383-5), from the diversity in
the character of the two chapters. Num 33 is purely statistical. The
catalogue given there "contains a complete list in regular order of all
the stations properly so called, that is to say, of those places of
encampment where Israel made a longer stay than at other times, and
therefore not only constructed an organized camp, but also set up the
tabernacle." In the historical account, on the other hand, the places
mentioned are simply those which were of historical importance. For this
reason there are fewer stations introduced between Mount Hor and Ijje
Abarim than in Num 33, stations where nothing of importance occurred
being passed over; but, on the other hand, there are a larger number
mentioned between Ijje Abarim and Arboth Moab, and some of them places
where no complete camp was constructed with the tabernacle set up,
probably because they were memorable as starting-points for the
expeditions into the two Amorite kingdoms.)

[Numbers 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 21:21</span></span>

Defeat of the Amorite Kings, Sihon of Heshbon and Og of Bashan, and
Conquest of their Kingdoms.

[Num 21:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021.md)

When the Israelites reached the eastern border of the kingdom of the
Amorite king Sihon (see at [Num
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013).md), they sent messengers to him,
as they had previously done to the king of Edom, to ask permission to
pass peaceably through his territory upon the high road (cf. [Num
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#022.md) and [Num
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#017).md); and Sihon refused this
request, just as the king of Edom had done, and marched with all his
people against the Israelites. But whereas the Lord forbade the
Israelites to make war upon their kinsmen the Edomites, He now commanded
them to make war upon the Amorite king, and take possession of his land
([Deu 2:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024).md); for the Amorites
belonged to the Canaanitish tribes which were ripe for the judgment of
extermination ([Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016).md). And if,
notwithstanding this, the Israelites sent to him with words of peace
([Deu 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026).md), this was simply done to
leave the decision of his fate in his own hand (see at [Deu
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024).md). Sihon came out against the
Israelites into the desert as far as Jahza, where a battle was fought,
in which he was defeated. The accounts of the Onom. concerning Jahza,
which was situated, according to Eusebius, between Medamon (Medaba) and
Debous (Dibon, see above), and according to Jerome, between Medaba and
Deblatai, may be reconciled with the statement that it was in the
desert, provided we assume that it was not in a straight line between
the places named, but in a more easterly direction on the edge of the
desert, near to the commencement of the Wady Wale, a conclusion to which
the juxtaposition of Jahza and Mephaot in [Jos
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018.md); [Jos
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#037.md), and [Jer
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#021.md), also points (see at [Jos
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018).md).

[Num 21:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024.md)

Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, i.e., without quarter (see
[Gen 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#026).md), and took possession of
his land "from Arnon (Mojeb) to the Jabbok, unto the children of Ammon,"
i.e., to the upper Jabbok, the modern Nahr or Moiet Ammn. The Jabbok,
now called Zerka, i.e., the blue, does not take its rise, as Seetzen
supposed, on the pilgrim-road by the castle of Zerka; but its source,
according to Abulfeda (tab. Syr. p. 91) and Buckingham, is the Nahr
Ammn, which flowed down from the ancient capital of the Ammonites, and
was called the upper Jabbok, and formed the western border of the
Ammonites towards the kingdom of Sihon, and subsequently towards Gad
([Deu 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#037.md); [Deu
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016.md); [Jos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002).md). "For the border of the
Ammonites was strong" (firm), i.e., strongly fortified; "for which
reason Sihon had only been able to push his conquests to the upper
Jabbok, not into the territory of the Ammonites." This explanation of
Knobel's is perfectly correct; since the reason why the Israelites did
not press forward into the country of the Ammonites, was not the
strength of their frontier, but the word of the Lord, "Make not war upon
them, for I shall give thee no possession of the land of the children of
Ammon" ([Deu 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019).md). God had only
promised the patriarchs, on behalf of their posterity, that He would
give them the land of Canaan, which was bounded towards the east by the
Jordan ([Num 34:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#002.md); compared with
[Gen 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#019.md) and [Gen
15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019).md); and the Israelites would
have received no settlement at all on the eastern side of the Jordan,
had not the Canaanitish branch of the Amorites extended itself to that
side in the time of Moses, and conquered a large portion of the
possessions of the Moabites, and also (according to [Jos
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025.md), as compared with [Jdg
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013).md) of the Ammonites, driving back
the Moabites as far as the Arnon, and the Ammonites behind the Nahr
Ammn. With the defeat of the Amorites, all the land that they had
conquered passed into the possession of the Israelites, who took
possession of these towns (cf. [Deu
2:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034).md). The statement in [Num
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025.md), that Israel settled in all the
towns of the Amorites, is somewhat anticipatory of the history itself,
as the settlement did not occur till Moses gave the conquered land to
the tribes of Reuben and Gad for a possession (Num 32). The only places
mentioned here are Heshbon and her daughters, i.e., the smaller towns
belonging to it (cf. [Jos 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017).md),
which are enumerated singly in [Num
32:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034.md), and [Jos
13:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015.md). In explanation of the
expression, "Heshbon and her daughters," it is added in [Num
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md), that Heshbon was the city,
i.e., the capital of the Amorite king Sihon, who had made war upon the
former king of Moab, and taken away all his land as far as the Arnon.
Consequently, even down to the time of the predecessor of Balak, the
king of the Moabites at that time, the land to the north of the Arnon,
and probably even as far as the lower Jabbok, to which point the kingdom
of Sihon extended (see [Deu 3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012.md);
[Jos 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005).md), belonged to the Moabites.
And in accordance with this, the country where the Israelites encamped
opposite to Jericho, before crossing the Jordan, is reckoned as part of
the land of Moab ([Deu 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#005.md); [Deu
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001.md); [Deu
32:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#049.md); [Deu
34:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#005).md), and called Arboth Moab (see
[Num 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001).md); whilst the women who
seduced the Israelites to join in the idolatrous worship of Baal Peor
are called daughters of Moab ([Num
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001).md).

[Num 21:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027.md)

The glorious conquest and destruction of the capital of the powerful
king of the Amorites, in the might of the Lord their God, inspired
certain composers of proverbs (משׁלים denom. from משׁל) to write songs
in commemoration of the victory. Three strophes are given from a song of
this kind, and introduced with the words "therefore,' sc., because
Heshbon had fallen in this manner, "the composers of proverbs say." The
first strophe ([Num 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027.md) and [Num
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028).md) runs thus: "Come to Heshbon:
Built and restored be the city of Sihon! For fire went out of Heshbon;
flames from the city of Sihon. It devoured Ar Moab, the lords of the
heights of Arnon." The summons to come to Heshbon and build this ruined
city up again, was not addressed to the Israelites, but to the conquered
Amorites, and is to be interpreted as ironical (F. v. Meyer; Ewald,
Gesch. ii. pp. 267, 268): "Come to Heshbon, ye victorious Amorites, and
build your royal city up again, which we have laid in ruins! A fire has
gone out of it, and burned up Ar Moab, and the lords of the heights of
the Arnon." The reference is to the war-fire, which the victorious
Amorites kindled from Heshbon in the land of Moab under the former king
of Moab; that is to say, the war in which they subjugated Ar Moab and
the possessors of the heights of Arnon. Ar Moab (see at [Num
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015).md) appears to have been formerly
the capital of all Moabitis, or at least of that portion of it which was
situated upon the northern side of the Arnon; and the prominence given
to it in [Deu 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md), [Deu
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#018.md), [Deu
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#029.md), is in harmony with this. The
heights of Arnon are mentioned as the limits to which Sihon had carried
his victorious supremacy over Moab. The "lords" of these heights are the
Moabites.

[Num 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029.md)

Second strophe: "Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art lost, people of Chemosh! He
has given up his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity-To
Sihon, king of the Amorites." The poet here turns to Moab, and announces
its overthrow. Chemosh (כּמושׁ, from כּמושׁ = כּבשׁ, subactor, domitor)
was the leading deity of the Moabites ([Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007).md) as well as of the Ammonites
([Jdg 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024).md), and related not only to
Milcom, a god of the Ammonites, but also to the early Canaanitish deity
Baal and Moloch. According to a statement of Jerome (on [Isa
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001).md), it was only another name for
Baal Peor, probably a god of the sun, which was worshipped as the king
of his nation and the god of war. He is found in this character upon the
coins of Areopolis, standing upon a column, with a sword in his right
hand and a lance and shield in the left, and with two fire-torches by
his side (cf. Ekhel doctr. numm. vet. iii. p. 504), and was appeased by
the sacrifice of children in times of great distress ([Kg2
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027).md). Further information, and to
some extent a different view, are found in the article by J. G. Mller in
Herzog's Cyclopaedia. The subject to נתן is neither Moab nor Jehovah,
but Chemosh. The thought is this: as Chemosh, the god of Moab, could not
deliver his people from the Amorite king; so now that Israel has
conquered the latter, Moab is utterly lost. In the triumph which Israel
celebrated over Moab through conquering its conquerors, there is a
forewarning expressed of the ultimate subjection of Moab under the
sceptre of Israel.

[Num 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030.md)

Third strophe, in which the woe evoked upon Moab is justified: "We cast
them down: Heshbon is lost even to Dibon; and we laid it waste even to
Nophah, with fire to Medeba." ונּירם is the first pers. pl. imperf. Kal
of ירה with the suffix ־ם for ־ם (as in [Exo
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#030).md). ירה, to cast arrows, to shoot
down ([Exo 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013).md): figuratively to
throw to the ground ([Exo 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#004).md).
נשּׁים for נשּׁם, first pers. pl. imperf. Hiph. of נשׁה, synonymous with
נצה, [Jer 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md). The suffixes of both
verbs refer to the Moabites as the inhabitants of the cities named.
Accordingly Heshbon also is construed as a masculine, because it was not
the town as such, but the inhabitants, that were referred to. Heshbon,
the residence of king Sihon, stood pretty nearly in the centre between
the Arnon and the Jabbok (according to the Onom. twenty Roman miles from
the Jordan, opposite to Jericho), and still exists in extensive ruins
with deep bricked wells, under the old name of Hesbn (cf. v. Raumer,
Pal. p. 262). On Dibon in the south, not more than an hour from Arnon.
Nophach is probably the same as Nobach, [Jdg
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#011.md), but not the same as Kenath,
which was altered into Nobach ([Num
32:42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#042).md). According to [Jdg
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#011.md), it was near Jogbeha, not far
from the eastern desert; and in all probability it still exists in the
ruined place called Nowakis (Burckhardt, p. 619; Buckingham, ii. p. 46;
Robinson, App. p. 188), to the north-west of Ammn (Rabbath-Ammon).
Nophach, therefore, is referred to as a north-eastern town or fortress,
and contrasted with Dibon, which was in the south. The words which
follow, עד מ אשׁר, "which to Medeba," yield no intelligible meaning. The
Seventy give πῦρ ἐπὶ Μ. (fire upon Medeba), and seem to have adopted the
reading עד אשׁ. In the Masoretic punctuation also, the ר in אשׁר is
marked as suspicious by a punct. extraord. Apparently, therefore, אשׁר
was a copyist's error of old standing for אשׁ, and is to be construed as
governed by the verb נשּׁים, "with fire to Medeba." The city was about
two hours to the south-east of Heshbon, and is still to be seen in ruins
bearing the name of Medaba, upon the top of a hill of about
half-an-hour's journey in circumference (Burckhardt, p. 625; v. Raumer,
Pal. pp. 264-5).

(Note: Ewald and Bleek (Einleitung in d. A. T. p. 200) are both agreed
that this ode was composed on the occasion of the defeat of the Amorites
by the Israelites, and particularly on the capture of the capital
Heshbon, as it depicts the fall of Heshbon in the most striking way; and
this city was rebuilt shortly afterwards by the Reubenites, and remained
ever afterwards a city of some importance. Knobel, on the other hand,
has completely misunderstood the meaning and substance of the verses
quoted, and follows some of the earliest commentators, such as Clericus
and others, in regarding the ode as an Amoritish production, and
interpreting it as relating to the conquest and fortification of Heshbon
by Sihon.)

[Num 21:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#031.md)

When Israel was sitting, i.e., encamped, in the land of the Amorites,
Moses reconnoitred Jaezer, after which the Israelites took "its
daughters," i.e., the smaller places dependent upon Jaezer, and
destroyed the Amorites who dwelt in them. It is evident from [Num
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#035.md), that Jaezer was not only
conquered, but destroyed. This city, which was situated, according to
the Onom. (s. v. Jazer), ten Roman miles to the west of Philadelphia
(Rabbath-Ammon), and fifteen Roman miles to the north of Heshbon, is
most probably to be sought for (as Seetzen supposes, i. pp. 397, 406,
iv. p. 216) in the ruins of es Szr, at the source of the Nahr Szr, in
the neighbourhood of which Seetzen found some pools, which are probably
the remains of "the sea of Jazer," mentioned in [Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md). There is less probability in
Burckhardt's conjecture, that it is to be found in the ruins of Ain
Hazir, near Kherbet el Suk, to the south-west of es Salt; though v.
Raumer (Pal. p. 262) decides in its favour (see my Commentary on [Jos
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025).md).

[Num 21:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#033.md)

The Israelites then turned towards the north, and took the road to
Bashan, where king Og came against them with his people, to battle at
Edrei. From what point it was that the Israelites entered upon the
expedition against Bashan, is not stated either here or in [Deu
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#001.md)., where Moses recapitulates these
events, and gives a more detailed account of the conquests than he does
here, simply because it was of no importance in relation to the main
object of the history. We have probably to picture the conquest of the
kingdoms of Sihon and Og as taking place in the following manner:
namely, that after Sihon had been defeated at Jahza, and his capital had
been speedily taken in consequence of this victory, Moses sent
detachments of his army from the places of encampment mentioned in [Num
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016.md), [Num
21:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#018.md), into the different divisions
of his kingdom, for the purpose of taking possession of their towns.
After the conquest of the whole of the territory of Sihon, the main army
advanced to Bashan and defeated king Og in a great battle at Edrei,
whereupon certain detachments of the army were again despatched, under
courageous generals, to secure the conquest of the different parts of
his kingdom (cf. [Num 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#039.md), [Num
32:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041).md). The kingdom of Og embraced
the northern half of Gilead, i.e., the country between the Jabbok and
the Mandhur ([Deu 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013.md); [Jos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005).md), the modern Jebel Ajlun, and
"all Bashan," or "all the region of Argob" ([Deu
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004.md), [Deu
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013).md), the modern plain of Jaulan
and Hauran, which extended eastwards to Salcah, north-eastwards to Edrei
([Deu 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010).md), and northwards to Geshur
and Maacha ([Jos 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005).md). For further
remarks, see [Deu 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md). There were two
towns in Bashan of the name of Edrei. One of them, which is mentioned in
[Deu 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004.md) and [Jos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004.md), along with Ashtaroth, as a
second residence of king Og, is described in the Onom. (s. v. Ashtaroth
and Edrei) as six Roman miles, i.e., fully two hours, from Ashtaroth,
and twenty-four or twenty-five miles from Bostra, and called Adraa or
Adara. This is the modern Der or Dra (in Burckhardt, p. 385; Seetzen, i.
pp. 363, 364), and Draah, Idderat (in Buckingham, Syr. ii. p. 146), a
place which still exists, consisting of a number of miserable houses,
built for the most part of basalt, and standing upon a small elevation
in a treeless, hilly region, with the ruins of an old church and other
smaller buildings, supposed to belong to the time when Draa, Adraa (as
urbs Arabiae), was an episcopal see, on the east of the pilgrim-road
between Remtha and Mezareib, by the side of a small wady (see Ritter,
Erdk. xv. pp. 838ff.). The other Edrei, which is mentioned in [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md) as the north-western frontier of
Bashan, was farther towards the north, and is still to be seen in the
ruins of Zorah or Ethra (see at [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010).md). In the present instance the
southern town is intended, which was not far from the south-west
frontier of Bashan, as Og certainly did not allow the Israelites to
advance to the northern frontier of his kingdom before he gave them
battle.

[Num 21:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#034.md)

Just as in the case of Sihon, the Lord had also promised the Israelites
a victory over Og, and had given him into their power, so that they
smote him, with his sons and all his people, without leaving any
remnant, and executed the ban, according to [Deu
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034.md), upon both the kings. (See the
notes on Deut 3).
