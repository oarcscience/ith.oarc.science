### [Psalms Chapter 114](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001)

Commotion of Nature before God the Redeemer out of Egypt

To the side of the general Hallelujah [Psa
113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001) comes an historical one, which
is likewise adorned in [Psa 114:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#008) with
the Chirek compaginis, and still further with Cholem compaginis, and is
the festival Psalm of the eighth Passover day in the Jewish ritual. The
deeds of God at the time of the Exodus are here brought together to form
a picture in miniature which is as majestic as it is charming. There are
four tetrastichs, which pass by with the swiftness of a bird as it were
with four flappings of its wings. The church sings this Psalm in a tonus
peregrinus distinct from the eight Psalm-tones.

[Psalms 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 114:1</span></span>

Egypt is called עם לעז (from לעז, cogn. לעג, לעה), because the people
spoke a language unintelligible to Israel ([Psa
81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006)), and as it were a stammering
language. The lxx, and just so the Targum, renders ἐκ λαοῦ βαρβάρου
(from the Sanscrit barbaras, just as onomatopoetic as balbus, cf.
Fleischer in Levy's Chaldisches Wrterbuch, i. 420). The redeemed nation
is called Judah, inasmuch as God made it His sanctuary (קדשׁ) by setting
up His sanctuary (מקדּשׁ, [Exo 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017))
in the midst of it, for Jerusalem (el ḳuds) as Benjamitish Judaean, and
from the time of David was accounted directly as Judaean. In so far,
however, as He made this people His kingdom (ממשׁלותיו, an amplificative
plural with Mem pathachatum), by placing Himself in the relation of King
([Deu 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005)) to the people of
possession which by a revealed law He established characteristically as
His own, it is called Israel. 1 The predicate takes the form ותּהי, for
peoples together with country and city are represented as feminine (cf.
[Jer 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#005)). The foundation of that new
beginning in connection with the history of redemption was laid amidst
majestic wonders, inasmuch as nature was brought into service,
co-operating and sympathizing in the work (cf. [Psa
77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015).). The dividing of the sea
opens, and the dividing of the Jordan closes, the journey through the
desert to Canaan. The sea stood aside, Jordan halted and was dammed up
on the north in order that the redeemed people might pass through. And
in the middle, between these great wonders of the exodus from Egypt and
the entrance into Canaan, arises the not less mighty wonder of the
giving of the Law: the skipping of the mountains like rams, of the ills
like בּני־צאן, i.e., lambs (Wisd. 19:9), depicts the quaking of Sinai
and its environs ([Exo 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018), cf.
supra [Psa 68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009), and on the figure
[Psa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006)).

[Psalms 114:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 114:5</span></span>

The poet, when he asks, "What aileth thee, O sea, that thou fleest...?"
lives and moves in this olden time as a contemporary, or the present and
the olden time as it were flow together to his mind; hence the answer he
himself gives to the question propounded takes the form of a triumphant
mandate. The Lord, the God of Jacob, thus mighty in wondrous works, it
is before whom the earth must tremble. אדון does not take the article
because it finds its completion in the following יעקב (אלוהּ); it is the
same epizeuxis as in [Psa 113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008); [Psa
94:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#003); [Psa
96:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007), [Psa
96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013). ההפכי has the constructive ı̂
out of the genitival relation; and in למעינו in this relation we have
the constructive ô, which as a rule occurs only in the genitival
combination, with the exception of this passage and בּנו באר, [Num
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003), [Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015) (not, however, in [Pro
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004), "his, the sluggard's, soul"),
found only in the name for wild animals חיתו־ארץ, which occurs
frequently, and first of all in [Gen
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024). The expression calls to mind
[Psa 107:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#035). הצּוּר is taken from [Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006); and חלּמישׁ (lxx τὴν ἀκρότομον,
that which is rugged, abrupt)

(Note: One usually compares Arab. chlnbûs, chalnabûs the Karaite
lexicographer Abraham ben David writes חלמבוס\]; but this obsolete word,
as a compound from Arab. chls, to be black-grey, and Arab. chnbs, to be
hard, may originally signify a hard black-grey stone, whereas חלמישׁ
looks like a mingling of the verbal stems Arab. ḥms, to be hard, and
Arab. ḥls, to be black-brown (as Arab. jlmûd, a detached block of rock,
is of the verbal stems Arab. jld, to be hard, and Arab. jmd, to be
massive). In Hauran the doors of the houses and the window-shutters are
called Arab. ḥalasat when they consist of a massive slab of dolerite,
probably from their blackish hue. Perhaps חלמישׁ is the ancient name for
basalt; and in connection with the hardness of this form of rock, which
resembles a mass of cast metal, the breaking through of springs is a
great miracle. - Wetzstein. For other views vid., on [Isa
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021); [Isa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007).)

stands, according to [Deu 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015),
poetically for סלע, [Num 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011), for it
is these two histories of the giving of water to which the poet points
back. But why to these in particular? The causing of water to gush forth
out of the flinty rock is a practical proof of unlimited omnipotence and
of the grace which converts death into life. Let the earth then tremble
before the Lord, the God of Jacob. It has already trembled before Him,
and before Him let it tremble. For that which He has been He still ever
is; and as He came once, He will come again.
