### [Ezekiel Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 41:1</span></span>

The Inner Space of the Temple (see Plate III B and C)

[Eze 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md). And he led me into the
temple, and measured the pillars, six cubits breadth on this side and
six cubits breadth on that side, with regard to the breadth of the tent.
[Eze 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002.md). And the breadth of the door
was ten cubits; and the shoulders of the door, five cubits on this side,
and five cubits on that: and he measured its length, forty cubits; and
the breadth, twenty cubits. [Eze 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md).
And he went within the measured the pillar of the door, two cubits; and
the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. [Eze
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004.md). And he measured its length,
twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, toward the temple; and
said to me, This is the holy of holies. - [Eze
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md) and [Eze
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002.md) give the measurements of the holy
place. היכל is used here in the more restricted sense for the nave of
the temple, the holy place (B), without the porch and the holy of holies
(cf. [Kg1 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#017).md). The measuring
commences with the front (eastern) wall, in which there was the entrance
door. This wall had pillars (e e) of six cubits breadth on either side
(on the right hand and the left), and between the pillars a door (d) ten
cubits broad, with door-shoulders (e e) of five cubits on this side and
that ([Eze 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002).md). These measurements
(6 + 6 + 10 + 5 + 5) yield for the front wall a total breadth of
thirty-two cubits. This agrees with the measurements which follow:
twenty cubits, the (internal) breadth of the holy place, and six cubits
the thickness of the wall (e) on either side ([Eze
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005).md). The only remaining difficulty
is in the very obscure words appended, רחב האהל, in which Ewald and
Hitzig propose to alter האהל into האיל otni האהל re, because the lxx
have substituted τοῦ αἰλάμ, but without making any improvement, as האיל
is still more inexplicable. Kliefoth, after examining the various
attempts to explain these words, comes to the conclusion that no other
course is left than to take האהל as signifying the inner space of
Ezekiel's temple, consisting of the holy place and the holy of holies,
which was the same in the entire building as the tabernacle had been, -
viz. the tent of God's meeting with His people, and which is designated
as אהל to show the substantial identity of this space and the
tabernacle. The clause רחב האהל is thus attached to the preceding double
מפּה (i.e., to the measurement of the two pillars bounding the holy
space), in an elliptical manner, in the following sense: "he measured
the breadth of the pillars, on this side and that, which marked off the
breadth of the tent, on the outside, that is to say, of the inner space
of the holy place which resembled the tabernacle;" so that this clause
formed a loose apposition, meaning, "with regard to the breath of the
tent." כּתפות הפּתח are the walls on both sides of the door (e e),
between the door and the boundary pillars. - The internal length and
breadth of the holy place are the same as in the holy place of Solomon's
temple ([Kg1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002.md), [Kg1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#017).md).

[Eze 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md) and [Eze
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004) refer to the holy of holies (c.md).
"He went within." We have וּבא (for ויּבוא) and not ויביאני ([Eze
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001).md), because the prophet was not
allowed to tread the most holy place, and therefore the angel went in
alone. פּנימה is defined in [Eze 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004.md)
as the holy of holies. The measurements in [Eze
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md) refer to the partition wall
between the holy place and the most holy (g). איל הפּתח, the pillar-work
of the door, stands for the pillars on both sides of the door; and the
measurement of two cubits no doubt applies to each pillar, denoting, not
the thickness, but the breadth which it covered on the wall. There is a
difficulty in the double measurement which follows: the door six cubits,
and the breadth of the door seven cubits. As the latter is perfectly
clear, and also apparently in accordance with the fact, and on measuring
a door the height is the only thing which can come into consideration in
addition to the breadth, we agree with Kliefoth in taking the six cubits
as a statement of the height. The height of six cubits bears a fitting
proportion to the breadth of seven cubits, if there were folding-doors;
and the seven is significant in the case of the door to the holy of
holies, the dwelling of God. The Seventy, however, did not know what to
do with this text, and changed רחב הפּתח שׁבע אמּות into τὰς ἐπωμίδας
τοῦ θυρώματος πηχῶν ἑπτὰ ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν, in which they have been
followed by Bttcher, Hitzig, and others. But it is obvious at once that
the Seventy have simply derived these data from the measurements of the
front of the holy place ([Eze 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002).md),
and have overlooked the fact, that in the first place, beside the
measure of the כּתפות הפּתח, i.e., ἐπωμίδες τοῦ πυλῶνος, the רחב הפּתח,
or breadth of the door, is also expressly measured there, whereas here,
on the contrary, it is preceded by הפּתח alone, without רחב; and
secondly, as the measurement of the אילים given in [Eze
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md) indicates their breadth (from
south to north), in the present instance also the measure ascribed to
the איל הפּתח can only refer to the breadth of the איל, and not to its
thickness (from east to west). But if we explain the first clause of
[Eze 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md) in this manner, as both the
language and the fact require, the reading of the lxx is proved to be a
false correction, by the fact that it yields a breadth of twenty-two or
twenty-four cubits (2 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 7), whereas the holy of holies, like
the holy place, was only twenty cubits broad. The dimensions of the holy
of holies also correspond to the space covered by the holy of holies in
Solomon's temple ([Kg1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020).md). The
expression אל־פּני ההיכל, "toward the holy place," is to be explained by
the supposition that the measuring angel, after he had proceeded to the
western end of the holy of holies for the purpose of measuring the
length, turned round again to measure the breadth, so that this breadth
lay "toward the holy place."

[Ezekiel 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005.md)

The Wall and the Side-Building

[Eze 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005.md). And he measured the wall of
the house six cubits, and the breadth of the side storey four cubits
round the house round about. [Eze
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006.md). And of the side-rooms there were
room upon room three, and that thirty times, and they came upon the
wall, which the house had by the side-rooms round about, so that they
were held, and yet they were not held in the wall of the house. [Eze
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007.md). And it spread out, and was
surrounded upwards more and more to the side-rooms, for the enclosure of
the house went upwards more and more round about the house; therefore
the house received breadth upwards; and so the lower ascended to the
upper after the proportion of the central one. [Eze
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#008.md). And I saw in the house a height
round about, with regard to the foundations of the side-rooms a full
rod, six cubits to the joint. [Eze
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#009.md). The breadth of the wall, which
the side storey had on the outside, was five cubits, and so also what
was left free was by the side-chamber building of the house. [Eze
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010.md). And between the cells was a
breadth of twenty cubits round the house round about. [Eze
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#011.md). And the door of the
side-chamber building led toward what was left free, one door toward the
north and one door toward the south, and the breadth of the space left
free was five cubits round about. - From the interior of the sanctuary
the measuring man turned to the outer work, and measured, first of all,
the wall of the house ([Eze 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005).md),
i.e., the wall commencing with the pillars in the front ([Eze
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001).md), which surrounded the holy place
and the holy of holies on the north, the west, and the south (e). This
was six cubits thick, He then measured the breadth of the צלע, i.e., of
the building consisting of three storeys of side-rooms, which was
erected against the north, west, and south sides of the sanctuary (h).
For צלע signifies not only a single side-room, but collectively the
whole range of these side-chambers, the entire building against the
sides of the temple house, called יצוּע in [Kg1
6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005.md), with which הצּלע ([Eze
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#008).md) is also used alternately there
(see the comm. on [Kg1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005).md).; - The
breadth of the side-building was four cubits in the clear, that is to
say, the space from the temple wall to the outer wall of the
side-building (f), which was five cubits thick ([Eze
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#009).md), and that uniformly all round
the temple. - The further particulars concerning the side-rooms in [Eze
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006.md) and [Eze
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007.md) are very obscure, so that they
can only be made perfectly intelligible by comparing them with the
description of the similar building in Solomon's temple. According to
this, [Eze 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006.md) is to be taken thus:
"and as for the side-rooms, there were room upon room (אל for על) three,
and (that) thirty times," and understood as signifying that there were
three side-rooms standing one above another, and that this occurred
thirty times, so that the side-building had three storeys, each
containing thirty rooms (chambers), so that there were thirty times
three rooms standing one above another (h h h). There is no necessity,
therefore, for the transposition of שׁלושׁ וּשׁלשׁים into שׁלשׁים
ושׁלושׁ, which Bttcher, Hitzig, and Hvernick have adopted from the lxx,
because of their having taken אל in the sense of against, room against
room thirty, and that three times, which yields the same thought, no
doubt, but not so clearly, inasmuch as it remains indefinite whether the
three times thirty rooms were above one another or side by side. Nothing
is said about the distribution of the thirty rooms in each storey; but
it is very probable that the distribution was uniform, so that on each
of the longer sides, i.e., against the northern and southern walls of
the temple, there were twelve rooms, and six against the shorter western
wall. The northern and southern walls were sixty cubits, plus six cubits
the thickness of the wall, plus four cubits the breadth of the side
building against the western wall (60 + 6 + 4), in all therefore seventy
cubits, or, deducting five cubits for the thickness of the outer wall at
the front of the building, sixty-five cubits long; and the western wall
was 20 + 2 x 6 (the thickness of the side wall), i.e., thirty-two cubits
long. If, therefore, we fix the length of each side-room at 4 1/2
cubits, there remain five cubits against the western wall for the seven
party walls required, or five-sevenths of a cubit for each, and against
the northern and southern walls eleven cubits for party walls and
staircase, and reckoning the party walls at four-sevenths of a cubit in
thickness, there are left four cubits and a seventh for the space of the
stairs, quite a sufficient space for a winding staircase.

The clauses which follow relate to the connection between these
side-rooms and the temple house. באות בּקּיר, they were coming (going)
upon the wall. בּוא ב, generally intrare in locu, here, on account of
what follows, to tread upon the wall; that is to say, they were built
against the wall in such a manner that the beams of the floors of the
three storeys rested on the temple wall on the inner side, i.e., were
held or borne by it, but not so as to be inserted in the wall and held
fast thereby. The only way in which this could be effected was by so
constructing the temple wall that it had a ledge at every storey on
which the beams of the side-storeys could rest, i.e., by making it
recede half a cubit, or become so much thinner on the outer side, so
that if the thickness of the wall at the bottom was six cubits, it would
be five cubits and a half at the first storey, five cubits at the
second, and four and a half at the third. In this way the side-rooms
were supported by the temple wall, but not in such a manner that the
beams laid hold of the walls of the sanctuary, or were dovetailed into
them, which would have done violence to the sanctity of the temple
house; and the side storeys appeared as, what they should be, an
external building, which did not interfere with the integrity of the
sanctuary. That this is the meaning of the words is rendered certain by
a comparison with [Kg1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006.md), where the
ledges on the temple wall are expressly mentioned, and the design of
these is said to be לבלתּי אחז בּקירות, that the beams might not be
fastened in the walls of the house, to which the last words of our
verse, ולא־יהיוּ אחוּזים בּקיר הבּית, refer. Kliefoth's rendering of
באות בּקּיר, "they went against the wall," is grammatically untenable,
as בּוא sa ,elba with ב does not mean to go against anything. אשׁר לבּית
לצּלעות, which the (temple) house had toward the side-rooms. סביב סביב,
round about, i.e., on all three sides of the temple. The peculiarity of
the storeys, arising from this resting upon the temple, is described in
[Eze 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007.md), of which different
explanations have been given, but the general meaning of which is that
it occasioned a widening of the side-rooms proceeding upwards from
storey to storey, as is plainly stated in [Kg1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006.md). The words ורחבה ונסבה are not to
be taken together, as expressing one idea, viz., "it spread round about"
(De Wette), but contain two different assertions, which are more
precisely defined in what follows by the substantives מוּסב and רחב.
Neither קיר nor הצלע is to be taken as the subject; but the verbs are to
be regarded as impersonal: "there spread out and surrounded," i.e., a
widening and a surrounding took place. The double למעלה has been
correctly explained by Bochart, viz., "by continued ascending," i.e.,
the higher one went the more extension and compass did one find, with
regard to, i.e., according to the measure of, the side-rooms or
side-storeys. לצּלעות belongs to למעלה, and is added for the purpose of
defining more precisely how the widening took place, not gradually, but
at each storey; for "these צלעות are the three rooms standing one above
another, spoken of in [Eze 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006.md)"
(Kliefoth).

This statement is explained, and the reason assigned, in the clause
introduced with כּי, the meaning of which depends upon the explanation
of the word מוּסב. This word may mean a way round, and a surrounding.
The Rabbins, whom Hvernick follows, understand by מוּסב a winding
staircase, the לוּלים mentioned in [Kg1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#008.md), which led from the lower storey
to the upper ones. This is decidedly wrong; for apart from the question
whether this meaning can be grammatically sustained, it is impossible to
attach any rational meaning to the words, "a winding staircase of the
house was upwards more and more round about the house," since a winding
staircase could never run round about a building seventy cubits long and
forty cubits broad, but could only ascend at one spot, which would
really give it the character of a winding staircase. Bttcher's
explanation is equally untenable: "for the winding round of the interior
was upwards more and more round and round inwards." For, in the first
place, הבּית does not mean the interior, and לבּית does not mean
inwards; and secondly, "winding round" is not equivalent to an
alteration of form in the shape of the rooms, through which those in the
bottom storey were oblongs running lengthwise, those in the central
storey squares, and those in the third oblongs running inwards, which
Bttcher imagines to have been the case. It would be much easier to adopt
the explanation of Kliefoth and others, who take מוּסב in the sense of a
way round, and regard it as signifying a passage running round the house
in the form of a gallery, by which one could walk all round the house,
and so reach the rooms in the upper storeys. This, as Kliefoth still
further remarks, was the reason why the surrounding of (circuit round)
the house was greater the higher one ascended, and also the reason why
it became wider up above in the upper storeys, as the words, "therefore
the breadth of the house increased upwards," affirm. In these words
Kliefoth finds a distinct assertion "that there is no foundation for the
assumption that the widening upwards was occasioned by the receding of
the temple walls; but that the widening of the building, which took
place above, arose from the passages round that were attached to the
second and third storeys, and that these passages ran round the
building, and consequently were attached to the outside in the form of
galleries." But we are unable to see how this can be distinctly asserted
in the words רחב לבּית למעלה. Even if הבּית, in connection with מוּסב,
signified the side-building, including the temple house, the only
thought contained in the words would be, that the side-building became
broader at each storey as you ascended, i.e., that the breadth of the
side-building increased with each storey. But even then it would not be
stated in what manner the increase in breadth arose; whether in
consequence of the receding of the temple wall at each storey, or from
the fact that the side-rooms were built so as to project farther out, or
that the side-storeys were widened by the addition of a passage in the
form of a gallery. And the decision in favour of one or other of these
possibilities could only be obtained from the preceding clause, where it
is stated that מוּסב הבּית went round about the side-building, and that
in favour of the last.

But, in the first place, the assumption that הבּית and לבּית denote the
side-building, to the exclusion of the temple house, is extremely harsh,
as throughout the whole section הבּית signifies the temple house; and in
[Eze 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006.md) לבּית is used again in this
sense. If we understand, however, by מוּסב הבּית a passage or a
surrounding all round the temple house, the words by no means imply that
there were outer galleries running round the side-rooms. In the second
place, it is extremely harsh to take מוּסב in the sense of a passage
round, if the preceding נסבה is to signify surrounded. As מוּסב takes up
the word נסבד again, and "precisely the same thing is signified by the
two verbs רחבה ונסבה as by the substantives רחב and מוּסב afterwards,"
we cannot render נסבה by surrounded, and מוסב by a passage round. If,
therefore, מוּסב signified a passage, a gallery running round the
building, this would necessarily be expressed in the verb נסבה, which
must be rendered, "there went round," i.e., there was a passage round,
more and more upwards, according to the measure of the storeys. But this
would imply that the passage round existed in the case of the bottom
storey also, and merely increased in breadth in the central and upper
storeys. Now a gallery round the bottom storey is shown to be out of the
question by the measurements which follow. From this we may see that the
supposition that there were galleries on the outside round the second
and third storeys is not required by the text, and possibly is
irreconcilable with it; and there is not even a necessity to adduce the
further argument, that Kliefoth's idea, that the entire building of
three storeys was simply upheld by the outer wall, without any support
to the beams from the wall of the temple, is most improbable, as such a
building would have been very insecure, and useless for the reception of
any things of importance. We therefore take נסב and מוּסב in the sense
of surrounded and surrounding. In this case, [Eze
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007.md) simply affirms that the
surrounding of the house, i.e., the side-building round about the temple
house, became broader toward the top, increasing (more and more)
according to the measure of the storeys; for it increased the more in
proportion to the height against the temple house, so that the house
became broader as you ascended. To this there is appended by means of
וכן the last statement of the verse: "and so the lower ascended to the
upper after the measure of the central one." This clause is taken by the
majority of the commentators to mean: thus they ascended from the lower
to the upper after the central one. But many have observed the folly of
an arrangement by which they ascended a staircase on the outside from
the lower storey to the upper, and went from that into the central one,
and have therefore followed the lxx in changing וכן into וּמן and
לתּיכונה into בּתּיכונה, "and from the lower (they ascended) to the
upper through the central one." But there is no apparent necessity for
these alterations of the text, as the reading in the text yields a good
sense, if we take התּחתּונה as the subject to יעלה: and thus the lower
storey ascended to the upper after the measure of the central one, - a
rendering to which no decisive objection can be urged on the ground of
the difference of gender (the masc. יעלה). וכן affirms that the ascent
took place according to the mode of widening already mentioned.

In the [Eze 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#008.md) we have a further
statement concerning the side-rooms, as we may see from the middle
clause; but it has also been explained in various ways. Bttcher, for
example, renders the first clause thus: "and I saw what the height round
about was in an inwardly direction;" but this is both grammatically
false and senseless, as לבּית does not mean inwardly, and "in an
inwardly direction" yields no conceivable sense. Kliefoth adopts the
rendering: "I fixed my eyes upon the height round about to the house;"
but this is also untenable, as ראה does not mean to fix the eyes upon,
in the sense of measuring with the eyes, and in this case also the
article could hardly be omitted in the case of גּבהּ. The words run
simply thus: "I saw in the house a height" = an elevation round about.
What this means is shown in the following words: the side-rooms had
foundations a full rod, i.e., the foundation of the rooms was a full rod
(six cubits) high. מיסדות is not a substantive מיסדות, but a participle
Pual מיסּדות; and the Keri is substantially correct, though an
unnecessary correction; מלו for מלוא (compare [Eze
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#016), מלוּ for מלאוּ.md). The
side-building did not stand on level ground, therefore, but had a
foundation six cubits high. This is in harmony with the statement in
[Eze 40:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#049.md), that they ascended by
steps to the temple porch, so that the temple house with its front porch
was raised above the inner court. As this elevation was a full rod or
six cubits, not merely for the side-building, but also for the temple
porch, we may assume that there were twelve steps, and not ten after the
lxx of [Eze 40:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#049.md), as half a cubit of
Ezekiel's measurement was a considerable height for steps. - The
expression which follows, "six cubits אצּילה," is obscure, on account of
the various ways in which אצילה may be understood. So much, however, is
beyond all doubt, that the words cannot contain merely an explanation of
the length of the rod measure: "six cubits (measured) to the wrist,"
because the length of the rod has already been fixed in [Eze
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md), and therefore a fresh definition
would be superfluous, and the one given here would contradict that of
[Eze 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md). אצּיל signifies connection
or joint, and when applied to a building can hardly mean anything else
than the point at which one portion of the building joins on to the
other. Hvernick and Kliefoth therefore understand by אצּיל the point at
which one storey ends and another begins, the connecting line of the
rooms standing one above another; and Hvernick takes the clause to be a
more precise definition of מיסדות הץ', understanding by מיסדות the
foundations of the rooms, i.e., the floors. Kliefoth, on the other hand,
regards the clause as containing fresh information, namely, concerning
the height of the storeys, so that according to the statement in this
verse the side-building had a foundation of six cubits in height, and
each of the storeys had also a height of six cubits, and consequently
the whole building was twenty-four cubits high, reckoning from the
ground. So much is clear, that מיסדות does not signify the floors of the
rooms, so that Hvernick's explanation falls to the ground. And
Kliefoth's view is also open to this objection, that if the words gave
the height of the storeys, and therefore supplied a second measurement,
the copula ו could hardly fail to stand before them. The absence of this
copula evidently leads to the conclusion that the "six cubits" אצּילה
are merely intended to furnish a further substantial explanation as to
the foundation, which was a full rod high, the meaning of which has not
yet been satisfactorily cleared up, as all the explanations given
elsewhere are still further from the mark.

In [Eze 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#009.md) there follow two further
particulars with reference to the side-building. The wall of it without,
i.e., on the outside (f), was five cubits thick or broad, and therefore
one cubit thinner than the temple wall. The מנּח in the side-building
was just the same breadth. In the clause beginning with ואשׁר the
measure (five cubits) given in the first clause is to be repeated, so
that we may render ו by "and also," and must take the words in the sense
of "just as broad." מנּח, the Hophal participle of הנּיח, to let alone,
in the case of a building, is that portion of the building space which
is not built upon like the rest; and in [Eze
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#011.md), there it is used as a
substantive, it signifies the space left open by the sides of the
building (Plate I i). The Chaldee rendering is אתר, locus relictus. בּית
צלעות is an adverbial or locative accusative: against the house of
side-chambers, or all along it; and אשׁר לבּית is an appositional
explanation: "which was to the temple," i.e., belonged to it, was built
round about it. - Consequently there is no necessity for any alteration
of the text, not even for changing בּית into בּין in order to connect
together [Eze 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#009.md) and [Eze
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010.md) as one clause, as Bttcher and
Hitzig propose; though all that they gain thereby is the discrepancy
that in [Eze 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#009.md) and [Eze
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010.md) the space left open between the
side-rooms against the temple house and between the cells against the
wall of the court is said to have been twenty cubits broad, whereas in
[Eze 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012.md) the breadth of this munnâch
is set down as five cubits. - There follows next in [Eze
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010.md) the account of the breadth
between the temple-building and the cells against the wall of the inner
court, and then in [Eze 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#011.md) we have
further particulars concerning the side-building and the space left
open. הלשׁכות ([Eze 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010).md) are the
cell buildings, more fully described in [Eze
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md)., which stood along the wall
dividing the inner court from the outer on the west of the north and
south gates of the inner court, and therefore opposite to the temple
house (Plate I L L). To the expression, "and between the cells there was
a breadth," there has to be supplied the correlative term from the
context, namely, the space between the מנּח and the לשׁכות had a breadth
of twenty cubits round about the house, i.e., on the north, west, and
south sides of the temple house. - The description of this space closes
in [Eze 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#011.md) with an account of the
entrances to the side-building. It had a door toward the space left
open, i.e., leading out into this space, one to the north and one to the
south (Plate III i i), and the space left open was five cubits broad
round about, i.e., on the north, west, and south sides of the
temple-building. מקום , the place of that which remained open, i.e., the
space left open.

If, then, in conclusion, we gather together all the measurements of the
temple house and its immediate surroundings, we obtain (as is shown in
Plate I) a square of a hundred cubits in breadth and a hundred cubits in
length, exclusive of the porch. The temple (G) was twenty cubits broad
in the inside ([Eze 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002).md); the wall
surrounding the sanctuary was six cubits ([Eze
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005)), or (for the two walls.md) 2 x 6 =
12 cubits. The side-buildings being four cubits broad in the clear on
each side ([Eze 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005).md), make 2 x 4 = 8
cubits. The outside walls of these buildings, five cubits on each side
([Eze 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#009).md), make 2 x 5 = 10 cubits.
The מנּח (i), five cubits round about ([Eze
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#011).md), makes 2 x 5 = 10 cubits. And
the space between this and the cells standing by the wall of the court
(e-g-h-f), twenty cubits round about ([Eze
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010).md), makes 2 x 20 = 40 cubits. The
sum total therefore is 20 + 12 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 40 = 100 cubits, in
perfect harmony with the breadth of the inner court given in [Eze
40:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#047.md). The length was as follows:
forty cubits the holy place, and twenty cubits the holy of holies ([Eze
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002.md) and [Eze
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004).md); the western wall, six cubits;
the side-rooms on the west, four cubits; and their wall, five cubits;
the מנּח, on the west, five cubits; and the space to the cells, twenty
cubits; in all, 40 + 20 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 20 = 100 cubits, as stated in
[Eze 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#013.md). The porch and thickness
both of the party-wall between the holy place and the most holy, and
also of the front (eastern) wall of the holy place, are not taken into
calculation here. The porch is not included, because the ground which it
covered belonged to the space of the inner court into which it
projected. The party-wall is not reckoned, because it was merely a thin
wooden partition, and therefore occupied no space worth notice. But it
is difficult to say why the front wall of the holy place is not
included. As there was no room for it in the square of a hundred cubits,
Kliefoth assumes that there was no wall whatever on the western side of
the holy place, and supposes that the back wall (i.e., the western wall)
of the porch supplied its place. But this is inadmissible, for the
simple reason that the porch was certainly not of the same height as the
holy place, and according to [Eze
40:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#048.md) it had only sixteen cubits of
external breadth; so that there would not only have been an open space
left in the upper portion of the front, but also an open space of two
cubits in breadth on either side, if the holy place had had no wall of
its own. Moreover, the measurement both of the pillars on both sides of
the front of the היכל ([Eze 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001).md), and
of the shoulders on both sides of the door ([Eze
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002).md), presupposes a wall or partition
on the eastern side of the holy place, which cannot be supposed to have
been thinner than the side-walls, that is to say, not less than six
cubits in thickness. We are shut up, therefore, to the conjecture that
the forty cubits' length of the holy place was measured from the
door-line, which was ten cubits broad, and that the thickness of the
door-shoulders on the two sides is included in these forty cubits, or,
what is the same thing, that they were not taken into account in the
measurement. The objection raised to this, namely, that the space within
the holy place would thereby have lost a considerable portion of its
significant length of forty cubits, cannot have much weight, as the
door-shoulders, the thickness of which is not reckoned, were only five
cubits broad on each side, and for the central portion of the holy
place, which was occupied by the door, and was ten cubits broad, the
length of forty cubits suffered no perceptible diminution. Just as the
pillars of the door of the holy of holies with the party-wall are
reckoned in the 40 + 20 cubits' length of the sanctuary, and are not
taken into consideration; so may this also have been the case with the
thickness of wall of the door-shoulders of the holy place. The
measurements of the space occupied by the holy place and holy of holies,
which have a symbolical significance, cannot be measured with
mathematical scrupulosity.

The Separate Place, and the External Dimensions of the Temple

[Eze 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012.md). And the building at the
front of the separate place was seventy cubits broad on the side turned
toward the west, and the wall of the building five cubits broad round
about, and its length ninety cubits. [Eze
41:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#013). And he measured the (temple.md)
house: the length a hundred cubits; and the separate place, and its
building, and its walls: the length a hundred cubits. [Eze
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#014.md). And the breadth of the face of
the (temple) house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred
cubits. - The explanation of these verses depends upon the meaning of
the word גּזרה. According to its derivation from גּזר, to cut, to
separate, גּזרה means that which is cut off, or separated. Thus ארץ
גּזרה is the land cut off, the desert, which is not connected by roads
with the inhabited country. In the passage before us, גּזרה signifies a
place on the western side of the temple, i.e., behind the temple, which
was separated from the sanctuary (Plate I J), and on which a building
stood, but concerning the purpose of which nothing more definite is
stated than we are able to gather, partly from the name and situation of
the place in question, and partly from such passages as [Ch1
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#018.md) and [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md), according to which, even in
Solomon's temple, there was a similar space at the back of the temple
house with buildings upon it, which had a separate way out, the gate
שׁלּכת, namely, that "this space,with its buildings, was to be used for
the reception of all refuse, sweepings, all kinds of rubbish, - in
brief, of everything that was separated or rejected when the holy
service was performed in the temple, - and that this was the reason why
it received the name of the separate place" (Kliefoth). The building
upon this space was situated אל־פּני־הגּזרה, in the front of the gizrah
(that is to say, as one approached it from the temple); and that פּאת
דּרך־היּם, on the side of the way to the sea, i.e., on the western side,
sc. of the temple, and had a breadth of seventy cubits (from north to
south), with a wall round about, which was five cubits broad (thick),
and a length of ninety cubits. As the thickness of the wall is specially
mentioned in connection with the breadth, we must add it both to the
breadth and to the length of the building as given here; so that, when
looked at from the outside, the building was eighty cubits broad and a
hundred cubits long. In [Eze 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#013.md)
this length is expressly attributed to the separate place, and (i.e.,
along with) its building, and the walls thereof. But the length of the
temple house has also been previously stated as a hundred cubits. In
[Eze 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#014.md) the breadth of both is also
stated to have been a hundred cubits - namely, the breadth of the outer
front, or front face of the temple, was a hundred cubits; and the
breadth of the separate place לקּדים toward the east, i.e., the breadth
which it showed to the person measuring on the eastern side, was the
same. If, them, the building on the separate place was only eighty
cubits broad, according to [Eze 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012.md),
including the walls, whilst the separate place itself was a hundred
cubits broad, there remains a space of twenty cubits in breadth not
covered by the building; that is to say, as we need not hesitate to put
the building in the centre, open spaces of ten cubits each on the
northern and southern sides were left as approaches to the building on
both sides (K), whereas the entire length of the separate place (from
east to west) was covered by the building. - All these measurements are
in perfect harmony. As the inner court formed a square of a hundred
cubits in length ([Eze 40:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#047).md), the
temple house, which joined it on the west, extended with its
appurtenances to a similar length; and the separate place behind the
temple also covered a space of equal size. These three squares,
therefore, had a length from east to west of three hundred cubits. If we
add to this the length of the buildings of the east gates of the inner
and outer courts, namely fifty cubits for each ([Eze
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#015.md), [Eze
40:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#021.md), [Eze
40:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#025.md), [Eze
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#029.md), [Eze
40:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#033.md), [Eze
40:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#036).md), and the length of the outer
court from gate to gate a hundred cubits ([Eze
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#019.md), [Eze
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#023.md), [Eze
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#027).md), we obtain for the whole of the
temple building the length of five hundred cubits. If, again, we add to
the breadth of the inner court or temple house, which was one hundred
cubits, the breadths of the outer court, with the outer and inner
gate-buildings, viz., two hundred cubits on both the north and south
sides, we obtain a total breadth of 100 + 200 + 200 = 500 (say five
hundred) cubits; so that the whole building covered a space of five
hundred cubits square, in harmony with the calculation already made (at
[Eze 40:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#024).md) of the size of the
surrounding wall.

Summary Account of the Measurement, the Character, and the Significant
Ornaments of the Projecting Portions of the Temple Building. - [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md). And thus he measured the length
of the building in the front of the separate place which was at the back
thereof, and its galleries on this side and that side, a hundred cubits,
and the inner sanctuary, and the porches of the court; [Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md). The thresholds, and the closed
windows, and the galleries round about all three - opposite to the
thresholds was wainscoting wood round about, and the ground up to the
windows; but the windows were covered - [Eze
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017). (The space.md) above the doors,
both to the inner temple and outside, and on all the wall round about,
within and without, had its measures. [Eze
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#018.md). And cherubs and palms were
made, a palm between every two cherubs; and the cherub had two faces;
[Eze 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#019.md). A man's face toward the
palm on this side, and a lion's face toward the palm on that side: thus
was it made round about the whole house. [Eze
41:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#020.md). From the floor to above the
doors were the cherubs and palms made, and that on the wall of the
sanctuary. [Eze 41:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#021.md). The sanctuary
had square door-posts, and the front of the holy of holies had the same
form. [Eze 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#022.md). The altar was of
wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and it had its
corner-pieces and its stand, and its walls were of wood: and he said to
me, This is the table which stands before Jehovah. [Eze
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#023.md). And the holy place and the holy
of holies had two doors. [Eze 41:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#024.md).
And the doors had two wings, two turning leaves; the one door two, and
the other two leaves. [Eze 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#025.md). And
there were made upon them, upon the doors of the sanctuary, cherubs and
palms, as they were made upon the walls; and a moulding of wood was on
the front of the porch outside. [Eze
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#026.md). And there were closed windows
and palms on this side and on that, on the side-walls of the porch, and
the side-rooms of the house, and the beams. - [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) is the commencement of a
comprehensive enumeration of particular features in the building, the
greater part of which have not been mentioned before; so that וּמדד (for
ויּמד) is to be rendered, "and thus he measured." The circumstance that
another measurement follows in [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md), whereas no further numbers are
given from [Eze 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) onwards, does
not warrant us in assuming that [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) is to be joined on to [Eze
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#014.md), and [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) to be taken in connection with
[Eze 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md). The absence of the cop. ו
before הסּפּים in [Eze 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md) is
sufficient to preclude the latter, showing as it does that הסּפּים
commences a fresh statement; and the words 'וההיכל וגו in [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) are still governed by the verb
וּמדד in [Eze 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md). The contents of
[Eze 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) are also decisive against
the separation mentioned. If, for instance, we connect [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) with [Eze
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#014.md), the first clause contains a
pure tautology, as the length of the building has been already measured,
and the result is given in [Eze 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#013.md).
The tautology does not exist, if the summary statements of the
measurement of different portions of the whole temple building commence
with [Eze 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md); and in connection
with these a supplementary account is given of various details not
mentioned before.

The contents of the second clause, namely, what is stated concerning the
אתּיקים, belong directly to the latter. The building in front of the
separate place, which was measured by the man, is more precisely
defined, so far as its situation is concerned, by the words אשׁר
על־אחריה. The feminine suffix in אחריה points back to הגּזרה;
consequently אשׁר can only refer to הבּנין: "the building...which was at
the back of the gizrah." This is not at variance with the situation
indicated in אל־פּני הגּזרה, but serves as a more exact definition of
this statement, showing that the building which stood at the front of
the gizrah occupied the hinder part of it, i.e., extended in length from
the front of the gizrah to the back. - The meaning of אתּוּקים or
אתּיקים, here (Keri) and in [Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md); [Eze
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003.md) and [Eze
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005.md), the only other passages in which
it occurs, is involved in obscurity. Even Raschi confesses that he does
not know what it means, and the older translators have simply resorted
to vague conjectures for their renderings; the lxx here, ἀπόλοιπα, in
[Eze 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003.md) and [Eze
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005.md) περίστυλον and στοαί; the
Vulgate, here, ethecas (the Hebrew word Latinized), in Ezekiel 42
porticus; Targum, in the London Polyglot, [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md), זיויתהא; [Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md), אתּיקיּא; [Eze
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003.md), זוי; and [Eze
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005.md), זיזיּא. There is no root אתק in
Hebrew; and the derivation of the word from עתק is not only uncertain,
but furnishes us with nothing that can be used for tracing the
architectural signification of the word. Even the context in [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) and [Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md) of this chapter supplies
nothing, for in both verses the meaning of the clauses in which אתיקים
stands is a matter of dispute. It is only in [Eze
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003.md) and [Eze
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005.md) that we find any clue. According
to [Eze 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003.md), in the three-storied
cell-building there was אתּיק אל־פּני on the third storey; and according
to [Eze 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005.md) the cells of the upper
storey in this building were shorter than those of the lower and central
storey, because אתּיקים took space away from them; and the reason for
this, again, was, that the three-storied cells had no pillars. From this
we may infer with certainty that the אתּיקים were galleries or passages
running along the outer walls of the building, which were not supported
by pillars, and therefore necessarily rested upon ledges obtained by the
receding of the rooms of the upper storey. This meaning also suits the
present chapter. The suffix in אתּוּקיהא (an Aramaic form for אתּיקיה)
points back, not to בּנין, but to הבּניה in [Eze
41:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#013.md); for the words, "and its
galleries on this side and on that," i.e., on the north and south sides
of the building, are not dependent upon ארך הבּנין, in the sense of "the
length of the building, with its galleries on this side and on that," as
ואתוקיהא is too widely separated from 'ארך הב for this. ואתוקיהא is
rather a second object to מדד: he measured (1) the length of the
building; (2) its galleries on this side and that - a hundred cubits;
(3) the inner temple, etc. The hundred cubits do not refer to the length
of the building, but to the galleries on both sides, which were of the
same length as the building, and therefore ran along its entire length,
- a fact which it was not superfluous to mention, as they might possibly
have been shorter. ההיכל הפּנימי is the temple house, with the buildings
against it, within the inner court. In addition to these, there are also
mentioned the porches of the court, i.e., at the gate-buildings of the
inner and outer courts, as the projecting portions of these buildings.
These three works mentioned in [Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) comprise the whole of the
buildings, the measurements of which have been mentioned in the previous
description - viz. the building to the west of the temple, in [Eze
41:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012.md); the inner temple, in [Eze
41:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md); the porches of the courts, to
which the temple porch in front of the holy place is to be added, as
having been reckoned in the measurement as belonging to the inner court,
in Ezekiel 41. - Thus the contents of our verse ([Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015).md) plainly show that it not only
is an indivisible whole, but forms a conclusion in which the foregoing
measurements are all summed up, and which serves as an introduction, in
accordance with this, to the following summary of various additional
features in the temple buildings which are also worthy of mention.

In this summary there are five points noticed: (a) the fact that all
parts of the buildings had their measurements ([Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md) and [Eze
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017)); (b.md) the significant
ornamentation of the inner walls of the sanctuary ([Eze
41:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#018)); (c.md) the altar in the holy
place ([Eze 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#022)); (d.md) the character
and decoration of the doors of the sanctuary ([Eze
41:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#023)); (e.md) the style of the porch
and of the side-buildings against the temple ([Eze
41:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#025.md), [Eze
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#026).md). - [Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md) and [Eze
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017.md) form one period, enlarged by the
parenthetical insertion of explanatory statements, similar to the
construction in [Eze 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#018.md) and [Eze
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#019.md). The predicate to the three
subjects - the thresholds, the closed windows, and the galleries - is
not to be sought for either in סביב or in 'הסּף שׁחיף וגו. The latter
construction, adopted by Bttcher and Hvernick, yields the unmeaning
assertion that the thresholds lay across in front of the threshold. The
former gives the apparently bald thought, that thresholds, windows, and
galleries were round about; in which the use of the article, the
thresholds, the windows, is exceedingly strange. The predicate to
'הסּפּים וגו is מדּות at the end of [Eze
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017.md) : the thresholds, etc., had
measurements; and the construction is so far anakolouthistic, that the
predicate מדּות, strictly speaking, belongs to the things mentioned in
[Eze 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017.md) alone, and the subjects
mentioned in [Eze 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md) are to be
regarded as absolute nominatives. The words סביב לשׁלשׁתּם belong to the
three preceding subjects, as a further definition, the thresholds,
windows, and galleries (which were) against these three round about. The
suffix to שׁלשׁתּם, "their triad," refers to the three buildings
mentioned in [Eze 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md) : the one upon
the separate place, the temple building, and the porches of the court;
and the appositional סביב is not to be so pressed as to lead to the
conclusion that all three buildings, and therefore the porches of the
court also, had אתּיקים round about. As the סביב לשׁלשׁתם is affirmed of
the thresholds, and the windows, and the galleries, and these three
objects are introduced by the article, as well known, i.e., as already
mentioned and described in the preceding verses, the more precise
definition (resp. limitation) of the apposition, "round about these
three," is to be taken from the preceding description of these three
buildings, and we are simply to assume the existence of thresholds,
windows, and galleries in these buildings in those cases in which they
have been mentioned in that description; so that the only place in which
there were galleries was the building upon the separate place. But
before the intended information is given concerning the thresholds,
etc., a remark is introduced, with the words from נגד הסּף to סביב, as
to the construction of the thresholds: viz., that opposite to the
threshold (הסּף being used in a general sense for every threshold) there
was שׁחיף עץ, a thin covering of wood, or wainscoting. נגד does not mean
across the front (Bttcher), but "opposite;" and the part opposite to the
threshold of a door is, strictly speaking, the lintel. Here, however,
the word is probably used in the broader sense for the framework of the
door, above and on the two sides, as is shown by סביב סביב which
follows. With הארץ a fresh object is introduced. הארץ is a nominative,
like הסּפּים, etc.; and the thought of supplying מן gniylppus, "from the
ground," has originated in a faulty interpretation of the words. The
idea is this: as the thresholds, the windows, etc., so also the ground
up to the windows, i.e., the space between the ground and the windows,
had measurements. The allusion to the windows is followed by the remark,
in the form of a circumstantial clause, that "the windows were covered."
מכסּות is apparently only a substantial explanation of אטמות (see the
comm. on [Eze 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#016).md).

In [Eze 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017.md) two further objects are
mentioned as having measurements; not, however, in the logical position
of subjects, but with prepositions על and אל: upon that which was above
the opening of the door...and (what was) on all the walls, i.e., the
space above the doors and on all the walls. To this periphrasis of the
subject, through על and אל, there is attached the predicate מדּות, which
belongs to all the subjects of [Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md) and [Eze
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017.md), in the sense of, "on all the
walls there were measures." The meaning is, that all the parts of the
building which have been named had their definite measurements, were
carefully measured off. In order to express this thought in as general
and comprehensive a manner as possible, the ideas contained in the
subjects in [Eze 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017.md) are expanded by
means of appositions: that of the space above, over the entrance door,
by ולחוּץ 'ועד הבּית הף (both ו-ו = et-et) into the inner temple, i.e.,
both the inside of the temple throughout, and also to the outside. The
idea of the whole wall is expressed by "round about, in the inside and
on the outside." - Thus everything in [Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md) and [Eze
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017.md) is clear, and in accordance with
fact; and there is no necessity either for the critical scissors of
Ewald and Hitzig, who cut out all that they do not understand as
glosses, or for the mal-emendation of Bttcher, who changes מדּות into
מקלעות ([Kg1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#018).md), and thus finds it
good to ornament the temple with sculptures, even on the outsides of all
the walls.

[Eze 41:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#018.md) treat of the ornamenting
of the inside of the sanctuary, i.e., of the holy place and the holy of
holies. [Eze 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#018.md) and [Eze
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#019.md) form, like [Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md) and [Eze
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017.md), a period extended by
parentheses. The predicate עשׂוּי, standing at the beginning of [Eze
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#018.md), is resumed in [Eze
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#019.md), and completed by ס'
'אל־כּל־הבּית ס. That the cherubim and palms were executed in sculpture
or carving, is evident from the resemblance to Solomon's temple. They
were so distributed that a cherub was followed by a palm, and this by a
cherub again, so that the palm stood between the two cherubim, and the
cherub turned one of its two faces to the palm on this side, and the
other to the palm upon that side. In sculpture only two faces could be
shown, and consequently these cherubic figures had only two faces, and
not four, like those in the vision. This sculpture was placed round
about the whole house, and that, as is added in [Eze
41:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#020.md) by way of explanation, from the
ground even to up above the door, namely, on the inner wall of the
sanctuary (ההיכל). כּל־הבּית is hereby limited to the היכל, the holy
place and the holy of holies. וקיר is a local accusative. To this there
is appended the further notice in [Eze
41:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#021.md), that the sanctuary had
door-posts in a square form. The loose arrangement of the words, "the
sanctuary post work of square form," is a concise form of expression
after the manner of brief topographical notices. מזוּזה invariably
signifies, wherever it occurs, the door-posts, i.e., the projecting
framework of the entrances. רבוּע, "foured," does not mean four-cornered
merely, but really square ([Exo 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001.md)
and [Exo 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#016).md). Consequently the
words, "the door-posts of the holy place were of a square shape," might
be understood as signifying not merely that the door-posts were beams
cut square, but, as Kliefoth supposes, that the post work surrounding
the door was made of a square form, that is to say, was of the same
height as breadth, which would be quite in keeping with the predominance
of the square shape, with its symbolical significance, in this picture
of a temple. But the statement in the second half of the verse can
hardly be reconciled with this; for whatever diversity there may be in
the interpretation of this verse in particular points, it is certain
that it does contain the general assertion that the doorway of the holy
of holies was also shaped in the same way. But the door of the holy of
holies, instead of being square, was (according to [Eze
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003).md) six cubits high and seven cubits
broad. הקּודשׁ, as distinguished from ההיכל, is the holy of holies,
which [Eze 41:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#023.md) places beyond all
doubt (for this use of הקּדשׁ, see [Lev
16:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md), [Lev
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#016).md). פּני־הקּדשׁ, the face of the
holy of holies, the front which met the eye of a person entering the
holy place. המּראה כּמּראה is the predicate, which is attached as
loosely as in the first hemistich. The front of the holy of holies had
the appearance like the appearance (just described), i.e., like the
appearance of the היכל; in fact, it had also a doorway with
four-cornered posts. J. F. Starch has already given this explanation of
the words: Eadem facies et aspectus erat utriusque portae templi et
adyti, utraque quadrata et quadratis postibus conspicua erat. The
proposal of Ewald, on the other hand, to connect כּמּראה with the
following word המּזבּח, "in front of the holy of holies there was
something to be seen like the shape of the altar" (lxx, Syr.), has the
article in המּראה against it (Bttcher).

[Ezekiel 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 41:22</span></span>

The Altar of Burnt-Offering in the holy place (see Plate III n). "The
abrupt style of writing is still continued." The altar wood for the
altar was of wood three cubits high; its length, i.e., the expanse of
the wall from one corner to the other, was two cubits; the breadth
(thickness), which is not expressly mentioned, was the same, because the
square form is presupposed from the shape of this altar in the
tabernacle and Solomon's temple. Under the term מקצעותיו, its
corner-pieces, the horns projecting at the corners, or the horn-shaped
points, are probably included, as the simple mention of the corners
appears superfluous, and the horns, which were symbolically significant
features in the altar, would certainly not have been wanting. There is
something strange in the occurrence of וארכוּ before and along with
קירות, as the length is already included in the walls, and it would not
be appropriately said of the length that it was of wood. ארכוּ is
therefore certainly a copyist's error for אדנוּ, ἡ βάσις αὐτοῦ (lxx),
its stand or pedestal. The angel describes this altar as the "table
which stands before Jehovah" - in perfect harmony with the epithet
already applied to the sacrifices in the Pentateuch, the "bread (לחם) of
God," though not "because the altar table was intended to combine the
old table of shewbread and the altar of incense" (Bttcher). The table of
shewbread is not mentioned any more than the candlestick and other
portions of the temple furniture. - The altar of burnt-offering stood
before Jehovah, i.e., before the entrance into the holy of holies. This
leads in [Eze 41:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#023.md). to the notice of
the doors of the sanctuary, the character of which is also described as
simply openings (פּתח), since the doorway had been mentioned before.
delet דּלת signifies a moveable door, and the plural דּלתות, doors,
whether they consist of one leaf or two, i.e., whether they are single
or folding doors. Here the דּלתות in [Eze
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#023.md) and [Eze
41:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#024) (לדלתות.md) are folding doors; on
the other hand, the first דּלתות in [Eze
41:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#024.md) and דּלת ibid. are used for the
wings of the door, and מוּסבּות for the swinging portions (leaves) of
the separate wings. The meaning is this: the holy place (היכל) and the
holy of holies (הקּדשׁ) had two folding doors (i.e., each of these rooms
had one). These doors had two wings, and each of these wings, in the one
door and in the other, had two reversible door-leaves, so that when
going in and out there was no necessity to throw open on every occasion
the whole of the wing, which was at least three or four cubits broad.
There is no foundation for the objection raised by Kliefoth to the
interpretation of להיכל ולקּדשׁ as signifying the holy place and the
holy of holies; since he cannot deny that the two words are so used,
היכל in [Kg1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005.md), [Kg1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#017.md), [Kg1
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#031.md), [Kg1
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#033.md), and קדשׁ in [Lev
16:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md), etc. And the artificial
explanation, "to the temple space, and indeed to the holy place," not
only passes without notice the agreement between our verses and [Kg1
6:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#031.md), but gains nothing further
than a side door, which does violence to the dignity of the sanctuary, a
passage from the side chambers into the holy place, with which Bttcher
has presented Solomon's temple. - These doors were ornamented, like the
walls, with figures of cherubim and palms. - Other remarks are added in
vv. 25b and 26 concerning the porch in front of the holy place. The
first is, that on the front of the porch outside there was עב אץ. The
only other passage in which the word עב occurs in a similar connection
is [Kg1 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#006.md), where it refers to
wood-work in front of the Ulam of Solomon's porch of pillars; and it
cannot be determined whether it signifies threshold, or moulding, or
threshold-mouldings. On the shoulders, i.e., on the right and left side
walls of the front porch, there were closed windows and figures of
palms. The cherubim were omitted here. - The last words of [Eze
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#026.md) are very obscure. וצלעות הבּ may
be taken in connection with the preceding clause, "and on the side-rooms
of the temple," as there is no necessity to repeat the preposition in
the case of closely continuous clauses (vid., Ewald, 351a); and the
side-rooms not only must have had windows, but might also be ornamented
with figures of palms. But if the words be taken in this sense, the
עבּים must also signify something which presented, like the walls of the
porch and of the side chambers, a considerable extent of surface capable
of receiving a similar decoration; although nothing definite has
hitherto been ascertained with regard to the meaning of the word, and
our rendering "beams" makes no pretension to correctness.
