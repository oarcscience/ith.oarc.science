The Restoration of Israel, and Destruction of Gog and Magog - Ezekiel
34-39

The promise of the salvation, which is to blossom for the covenant
nation after the judgment, commences with the announcement that the Lord
will deliver Israel out of the hand of its evil shepherds, who only feed
themselves and destroy the flock, and will take care of His own flock,
gather them together, feed and tend them on a good meadow, protect the
weak sheep against the strong, and through His servant David bring
security and blessing to the whole of the flock (Ezekiel 34). This
comprehensive promise is carried out still further in the following
chapters in various phases. Because Edom cherishes perpetual enmity
against the sons of Israel, and has sought to take possession of their
land, in which Jehovah was, the mountains of Seir shall become a
perpetual desert ([Eze 35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001).md);
whereas the devastated land of Israel shall be rebuilt, and sown once
more, bear fruit, and be filled with man and beast ([Eze
36:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001).md). The Lord will do this for
His holy name's sake, will cleanse His people from their sins, when
gathered out of the nations, by sprinkling them with pure water, and
renew them by His Spirit in heart and mind, that they may walk in His
commandments, and multiply greatly in their land, when it has been
glorified into a garden of God (Ezekiel 36:16-38). The house of Israel,
which has been slain with the sword, and has become like a field full of
dry bones of the dead, the Lord will awaken to new life, and bring in
peace into the land of Israel ([Eze
37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001).md); the two divided peoples and
kingdoms of Israel He will unite into one people and kingdom, will
liberate them from their sins, cause them to dwell in the land given to
His servant Jacob under the sovereignty of His servant David, will make
with them a covenant of peace for ever, and dwell above them as their
God for ever in the sanctuary, which He will establish in the midst of
them ([Eze 37:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015).md). And, finally, in
the last time, when Israel is dwelling in its own land in security and
peace, the Lord will bring Gog from the land of Magog, the prince of
Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, with a powerful army of numerous peoples, into
the land that has been restored from the sword; but when he has come to
plunder and prey, the Lord will destroy him with all his army, and by
this judgment display His glory among the nations, and so have
compassion upon the whole house of Israel, and because He has poured out
His Spirit upon it, will hide His face from it no more (Ezekiel 38 and
39). - From this general survey it is evident that the words of God
contained in Ezekiel 34-37 announce the restoration and exaltation of
Israel to be the sanctified people of God, and Ezekiel 38 and 39 the
lasting establishment of this salvation, through the extermination of
those enemies who rise up against the restored people of God.

Deposition of the Bad Shepherds; Collecting and Tending of the Flock;
and Appointment of the One Good Shepherd - Ezekiel 34

The shepherds, who have fed themselves and neglected the flock, so that
it has been scattered and has become a prey to wild beasts, will be
deprived by the Lord of their office of shepherd ([Eze
34:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001).md). And He will take charge of
His own flock, gather it together from its dispersion in the lands, feed
and tend it on good pasture in the land of Israel, and sift it by the
extermination of the fat and violent ones ([Eze
34:11-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011).md). He will appoint His servant
David shepherd over His flock, make a covenant of peace with His people,
and bless the land with fruitfulness, so that Israel may dwell there in
security, and no more be carried off either as booty for the nations or
by famine, and may acknowledge Jehovah as its God ([Eze
34:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023).md).

This word of God is a repetition and further expansion of the short
prophecy of Jeremiah in [Jer 23:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md).
The threat against the bad shepherds simply forms the foil for the
promise, that the flock, which has been plunged into misery by bad
shepherds, shall be gathered and tended by the Lord and His servant
David, whom Jehovah will appoint prince over His people, so that it is
essentially a prophecy of salvation for Israel. - The question in
dispute among the commentators, whether we are to understand by the
shepherds, out of whose hand and tyranny the Lord will rescue Israel His
flock, the priests ad kings (Ephr., Syr., and Theodoret), or the false
prophets and false teachers of the people (Glass and others), or simply
the kings (Hengst., Hהv., and others), or all those who, by reason of
their office, were leaders of the people, rulers, priests, and prophets,
"the whole body of official persons charged with the direction of the
nation" (Kliefoth), may be settled by the simple conclusion, that only
the rulers of the nation are intended. This is proved not only by the
biblical idea of the shepherd generally, which (probably in distinction
from the idea of the bell-wether) is everywhere employed to denote
rulers alone, but more particularly by the primary passage already
referred to ([Jer 23:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001).md), where we
are to understand by the shepherds, kings and princes, to the exclusion
of priests and prophets, against whom Jeremiah first prophesies from
[Eze 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#009.md) onwards; and, lastly, by the
antithesis to the good shepherd, David, who is to feed the flock of
Jehovah as prince (נשׂיא), and not as priest or prophet ([Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md), [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024).md). Only we must not take the term
rulers as applying to the kings alone, but must understand thereby all
the persons entrusted with the government of the nation, or the whole
body of the civil authorities of Israel, among whom priests and prophets
come into consideration, not on account of their spiritual calling and
rank, but only so far as they held magisterial offices. And apart from
other grounds, we are not warranted in restricting the idea of shepherds
to the kings alone; for the simple reason that our prophecy, which dates
from the time succeeding the destruction of Jerusalem, does not apply to
the former rulers only, i.e., the kings who had fallen along with the
kingdom of Judah, but although treating of shepherds, who had scattered
Israel among the nations, assumes that the rule of these shepherds is
still continuing, and announces their removal, or the deliverance of the
flock out of their hand, as something to be effected in the future (cf.
[Eze 34:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#008).md); so that it also refers
to the civil rulers who governed Israel after the overthrow of the
monarchy, and even after the captivity until the coming of the Messiah,
the promised Prince of David.

Woe to the Bad Shepherds

[Eze 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001.md). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md). Son of
man, prophesy concerning the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to
them, to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the
shepherds of Israel, who fed themselves; should not the shepherds feed
the flock? [Eze 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003.md). Ye eat the fat,
and clothe yourselves whit the wool; ye slay the fattened; the flock ye
do not feed. [Eze 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004.md). The weak ones
ye do not strengthen, and that which is sick ye do not cure, the wounded
one ye bind not up, the scattered ye bring not back, and the lost one ye
do not seek; and ye rule over them with violence and with severity. [Eze
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005.md). Therefore they were scattered,
because without shepherd, and became food to all the beasts of the
field, and were scattered. [Eze 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#006.md).
My sheep wander about on all the mountains, and on every high hill; and
over all the land have my sheep been scattered, and there is no one who
asks for them, and no one who seeks them. [Eze
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#007.md). Therefore, ye shepherds, hear ye
the word of Jehovah: [Eze 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#008.md). As I
live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, because my sheep become a prey,
and my sheep become food to all the beasts of the field, because there
is no shepherd, and my shepherds do not inquire after my sheep, and the
shepherds feed themselves, but do not feed the sheep, [Eze
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#009.md). Therefore, ye shepherds, hear ye
the word of Jehovah, [Eze 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#010.md). Thus
saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will deal with the shepherds, and will
demand my sheep from their hand, and cause them to cease to feed my
flock, that they may feed themselves no more; and I will deliver my
sheep from their mouth, that they may be food to them no more. - In [Eze
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md) לרעים is an explanatory
apposition to אליהם, and is not to be taken in connection with כּה אמר
יי, in opposition to the constant use of this formula, as Kliefoth
maintains. The reason for the woe pronounced is given in the apposition,
who fed themselves, whereas they ought to have fed the flock; and the
charge that they only care for themselves is still further explained by
a description of their conduct ([Eze
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003.md) and [Eze
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004).md), and of the dispersion of the
flock occasioned thereby ([Eze 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005.md)
and [Eze 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#006).md). Observe the
periphrastic preterite היוּ רעים, they were feeding, which shows that
the woe had relation chiefly to the former shepherds or rulers of the
nation. אותם is reflective, se ipsos (cf. Gesen. 124. 1b). The
disgracefulness of their feeding themselves is brought out by the
question, "Ought not the shepherds to feed the flock?" [Eze
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003.md) shows how they fed themselves,
and [Eze 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004.md) how they neglected the
flock. חלב, the fat, which Bochart and Hitzig propose to alter into
החלב, the milk, after the Septuagint and Vulgate, is not open to any
objection. The fat, as the best portion of the flesh, which was laid
upon the altar, for example, in the case of the sacrifices, as being the
flower of all the flesh, is mentioned here as pars melior pro toto.
Hvernick has very properly pointed, in vindication of the reading in the
text, to [Zac 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#016.md), where the two
clauses, ye eat the fat, and slay the fattened, are joined together in
the one clause, "the flesh of the fattened one will he eat." There is no
force in the objection raised by Hitzig, that "the slaughtering of the
fat beasts, which ought to be mentioned first, is not introduced till
afterwards;" for this clause contains a heightening of the thought that
they use the flock to feed themselves: they do not even kill the leaner
beasts, but those that are well fattened; and it follows very suitably
after the general statement, that they make use of both the flesh and
the wool of the sheep for their own advantage. They care nothing for the
wellbeing of the flock: this is stated in the last clause of [Eze
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003.md), which is explained in detail in
[Eze 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004.md). נהלות is the Niphal
participle of חלה, and is a contracted form of נחלות, like נחלה in [Isa
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#011.md). The distinction between נהלות
and חולה is determined by the respective predicates חזּק and רפא.
According to these, נחלה signifies that which is weak in consequence of
sickness, and חלה that which is weak in itself. נשׁבּרת, literally, that
which is broken, an animal with a leg or some other member injured.
נדּח, scattered, as in [Deu 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md).

In the last clause of [Eze 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004.md), the
neglect of the flock is summed up in the positive expression, to rule
over them with violence and severity. רדה בפרך is taken from [Lev
25:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#043.md), [Lev
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#046.md); but there as well as here it
points back to [Exo 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#013.md), where
בפרך is applied to the tyrannical measures adopted by Pharaoh for the
oppression of the Israelites. The result of this ([Eze
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005.md), [Eze
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#006).md) was, that the sheep were
scattered, and became food to the beasts of prey. מבּלי, on account of
there not being a shepherd, i.e., because there was no shepherd worthy
of the name. This took place when Israel was carried away into exile,
where it became a prey to the heathen nations. When we find this
mournful fate of the people described as brought about by the bad
shepherds, and attributable to faults of theirs, we must not regard the
words as applying merely to the mistaken policy of the kings with regard
to external affairs (Hitzig); for this was in itself simply a
consequence of their neglect of their theocratic calling, and of their
falling away from the Lord into idolatry. It is true that the people had
also made themselves guilty of this sin, so that it was obliged to atone
not only for the sins of its shepherds, but for its own sin also; but
this is passed by here, in accordance with the design of this prophecy.
And it could very properly be kept out of sight, inasmuch as the rulers
had also occasioned the idolatry of the people, partly by their neglect
of their duty, and partly by their bad example. ותּפוּצינה is repeated
with emphasis at the close of [Eze
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005.md); and the thought is still further
expanded in [Eze 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#006.md). The wandering
upon all the mountains and hills must not be understood as signifying
the straying of the people to the worship on high places, as Theodoret
and Kliefoth suppose. The fallacy of this explanation is clearly shown
by the passage on which this figurative description rests ([Kg1
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#017).md), where the people are
represented as scattered upon the mountains in consequence of the fall
of the king in battle, like a flock that had no shepherd. The words in
the next clause, corresponding to the mountains and hills, are כּל־פּני
הארץ, the whole face of the land, not "of the earth" (Kliefoth). For
although the dispersion of the flock actually consisted in the carrying
away of the people into heathen lands, the actual meaning of the figure
is kept in the background here, as is evident from the fact that Ezekiel
constantly uses the expression הארצות (plural) when speaking of the
dispersion among the heathen (cf. Ezekiel 13). The distinction between
דּרשׁ and בּקּשׁ is, that דרשׁ taht , signifies rather to ask, inquire
for a thing, to trouble oneself about it, whereas בקשׁ means to seek for
that which has strayed or is lost. In [Eze
34:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#007.md), the punishment for their
unfaithfulness is announced to the shepherds themselves; but at the same
time, as is constantly the case with Ezekiel, their guilt is once more
recapitulated as an explanation of the threatening of punishment, and
the earnest appeal to listen is repeated in [Eze
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#009.md). The Lord will demand His sheep
of them; and because sheep have been lost through their fault, He will
dispose them from the office of shepherd, and so deliver the poor flock
from their violence. If we compare with this [Jer
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#002.md) : "Behold, I will visit upon you
the wickedness of your doings," the threat in Ezekiel has a much milder
sound. There is nothing said about the punishment of the shepherd, but
simply that the task of keeping the sheep shall be taken from them, so
that they shall feed themselves no more. This distinction is to be
explained from the design of our prophecy, which is not so much to
foretell the punishment of the shepherds, as the deliverance from
destruction of the sheep that have been plunged into misery. The
repetition of צאני, my flock ([Eze
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#008.md) and [Eze
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#010.md), as before in [Eze
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#006).md), is also connected with this.
The rescue of the sheep out of the hand of the bad shepherds had already
commenced with the overthrow of the monarchy on the destruction of
Jerusalem. If, then it is here described as only to take place in the
future, justice is not done to these words by explaining them, as Hitzig
does, as signifying that what has already actually taken place is now to
be made final, and not to be reversed. For although this is implied, the
words clearly affirm that the deliverance of the sheep out of the hand
of the shepherds has not yet taken place, but still remains to be
effected, so that the people are regarded as being at the time in the
power of bad shepherds, and their rescue is predicted as still in the
future. How and when it will be accomplished, by the removal of the bad
shepherds, is shown in the announcement, commencing with [Eze
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011.md), of what the Lord will do for
His flock.

[Ezekiel 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 34:11</span></span>

Jehovah Himself will seek His flock, gather it together from the
dispersion, lead it to good pasture, and sift it by the destruction of
the bad sheep. - [Eze 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011.md). For thus
saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I myself, I will inquire after my flock,
and take charge thereof. [Eze 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md).
As a shepherd taketh charge of his flock in the day when he is in the
midst of his scattered sheep, so will I take charge of my flock, and
deliver them out of all the places whither they have been scattered in
the day of cloud and cloudy night. [Eze
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013.md). And I will bring them out from
the nations, and gather them together out of the lands, and bring them
into their land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel, in the
valleys, and in all the dwelling-places of the land. [Eze
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#014.md). I will feed them in a good
pasture, and on the high mountains of Israel will their pasture-ground
be: there shall they lie down in a good pasture-ground, and have fat
pasture on the mountains of Israel. [Eze
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#015.md). I will feed my flock, and I
will cause them to lie down, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. [Eze
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016.md). That which is lost will I seek,
and that which is driven away will I bring back; that which is wounded
will I bind up, and that which is sick will I strengthen: but that which
is fat and strong will I destroy, and feed them according to justice.
[Eze 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017.md). And you, my sheep, thus
saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will judge between sheep and sheep,
and the rams and the he-goats. [Eze
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#018.md). Is it too little for you, that
ye eat up the good pasture, and what remains of your pasture ye tread
down with your feet? and the clear water ye drink, and render muddy what
remains with your feet? [Eze 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#019.md).
And are my sheep to have for food that which is trodden down by your
feet, and to drink that which is made muddy by your feet? [Eze
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#020.md). Therefore thus saith the Lord
Jehovah to them, Behold, I, I will judge between fat sheep and lean.
[Eze 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#021.md). Because ye press with side
and shoulder, and thrust all the weak with your horns, till ye have
driven them out; [Eze 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#022.md). I will
help my sheep, so that they shall no more become a prey; and will judge
between sheep and sheep. - All that the Lord will do for His flock is
summed up in [Eze 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011.md), in the words
דּרשׁתּי את־צאני וּבקּרתּים, which stand in obvious antithesis to 'ואין
דּורשׁ וגו in [Eze 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#006.md) - an
antithesis sharply accentuated by the emphatic הנני אני, which stands at
the head in an absolute form. The fuller explanation is given in the
verses which follow, from [Eze 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md)
onwards. Observe here that biqeer is substituted for בּקּשׁ. בּקּר, to
seek and examine minutely, involves the idea of taking affectionate
charge. What the Lord does for His people is compared in [Eze
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md) to the care which a shepherd who
deserves the name manifests towards sheep when they are scattered
(נפרשׁות without the article is connected with צאנו in the form of
apposition); and in [Eze 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md) it is
still more particularly explained. In the first place, He will gather
them from all the places to which they have been scattered. הצּיל
implies that in their dispersion they have fallen into a state of
oppression and bondage among the nations (cf. [Exo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006).md). בּיום belongs to the relative
clause: whither they have been scattered. The circumstance that these
words are taken from [Joe 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md) does not
compel us to take them in connection with the principal clause, as
Hitzig and Kliefoth propose, and to understand them as relating to the
time when God will hold His judgment of the heathen world. The notion
that the words in Joel signify "God's day of judgment upon all the
heathen" (Kliefoth), is quite erroneous; and even Hitzig does not derive
this meaning from [Joe 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md), but from
the combination of our verse with [Eze
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#003.md) and [Eze
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#021.md). The deliverance of the sheep
out of the places to which they have been scattered, consists in the
gathering together of Israel out of the nations, and their restoration
to their own land, and their feeding upon the mountains and all the
dwelling-places of the land (מושׁב, a place suitable for settlement),
and that in good and fat pasture ([Eze
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#014).md); and lastly, in the fact that
Jehovah bestows the necessary care upon the sheep, strengthens and heals
the weak and sick ([Eze 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#015.md) and [Eze
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016).md) - that is to say, does just
what the bad shepherds have omitted ([Eze
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004).md) - and destroys the fat and
strong. In this last clause another side is shown of the pastoral
fidelity of Jehovah. אשׁמיד has been changed by the lxx, Syr., and Vulg.
into ,אשׁמורφυλάχω; and Luther has followed them in his rendering, "I
will watch over them." But this is evidently a mistake, as it fails to
harmonize with ארענּה במשׁפּט. The fat and strong sheep are
characterized in [Eze 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#018.md) and [Eze
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#019.md) as those which spoil the food
and water of the others. The allusion, therefore, is to the rich and
strong ones of the nation, who oppress the humble and poor, and treat
them with severity. The destruction of these oppressors shows that the
loving care of the Lord is associated with righteousness - that He feeds
the flock בּמשׁפּט.

This thought is carried out still further in [Eze
34:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017.md), the sheep themselves being
directly addressed, and the Lord assuring them that He will judge
between sheep and sheep, and put an end to the oppressive conduct of the
fat sheep and the strong. בּין שׂה לשׂה: between the one sheep and the
other. לשׂה is extended in the apposition, "the rams and he-goats,"
which must not be rendered, "with regard to the rams and he-goats," as
it has been by Kliefoth. The thought is not that Jehovah will divide the
rams and he-goats from the sheep, as some have explained it, from an
inappropriate comparison with [Mat
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032.md); but the division is to be
effected in such a manner that sheep will be separated from sheep, the
fat sheep being placed on one side with the rams and he-goats, and kept
apart from the lean (רזה, [Eze 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#020).md)
and the sickly sheep (נהלות, [Mat
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021).md). It is to the last-named sheep,
rams, and he-goats that [Mat 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#018.md) and
[Mat 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#019.md) are addressed. With regard
to the charge brought against them, that they eat up the pasture and
tread down the remainder with their feet, etc., Bochart has already
correctly observed, that "if the words are not quite applicable to
actual sheep, they are perfectly appropriate to the mystical sheep
intended here, i.e., to the Israelites, among whom many of the rich,
after enjoying an abundant harvest and vintage, grudged the poor their
gleaning in either one or the other." משׁקע, a substantive formation,
like מרמס, literally, precipitation of the water, i.e., the water
purified by precipitation; for שׁקע, to sink, is the opposite of רפשׂ,
to stir up or render muddy by treading with the feet (compare [Eze
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014.md) and [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002).md). בּריה, [Eze
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#020.md) = בּראה or בּריּה. [Eze
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#022.md) brings to a close the
description of the manner in which God will deliver His flock, and feed
it with righteousness. והושׁעתּי points back to והצּלתּי in [Eze
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md), and ושׁפטתּי to ארענּה במשׁפּט
in [Eze 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016.md). - To this there is
appended in [Eze 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md). a new train of
thought, describing how God will still further display to His people His
pastoral fidelity.

Appointment of David as Shepherd, and Blessing of the People

[Eze 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md). And I will raise up one
shepherd over them, who shall feed them, my servant David; he will feed
them, and he will be to them a shepherd. [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md). And I, Jehovah, will be God to
them, and my servant David prince in the midst of them: I, Jehovah, have
spoken it. [Eze 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md). And I will make
a covenant of peace with them, and destroy the evil beasts out of the
land, so that they will dwell safely in the desert and sleep in the
forests. [Eze 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#026.md). And I will make
them and the places round my hill a blessing, and cause the rain to fall
in its season: showers of blessing shall there be. [Eze
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#027.md). The tree of the field will give
its fruit, and the land will give its produce, and they will be safe in
their land, and will know that I am Jehovah, when I break their
yoke-bars in pieces, and deliver them out of the hand of those who made
them servants. [Eze 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#028.md). They will
be no more a prey to the nations, and the wild beasts will not devour
them; but they will dwell safely, and no one will terrify them. [Eze
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#029.md). And I will raise up for them a
plantation for a name, so that they will no more be swept away by famine
in the land, and shall no longer bear the disgrace of the heathen
nations. [Eze 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#030.md). And they shall
know that I, Jehovah, their God, am with them, and they are my people,
the house of Israel, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. [Eze
34:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#031.md). And ye are my sheep, the flock
of my pasture; ye are men, I am your God, is the saying of the Lord
Jehovah. - God will cause to stand up, raise up, one single shepherd
over His flock. הקים, the standing expression for the rising up of a
person in history through the interposition of God (cf. [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md); [Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012), and other passages.md). רעה, not
unicus, singularis, a shepherd unique in his kind, but one shepherd, in
contrast not only with the many bad shepherds, but with the former
division of the people into two kingdoms, each with its own separate
king. Compare [Eze 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md) with [Jer
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#006.md), where it is expressly said that
the David to be raised up is to feed Israel and Judah, the two peoples
that had been divided before. "My servant David:" Jehovah calls him
עבדּי, not merely with reference to the obedience rendered (Hvernick),
but also with regard to his election ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001); Hengstenberg.md). There is no
necessity to refute the assertion of Hitzig, David Strauss, and others,
that Ezekiel expected the former King David to be raised from the dead.
The reference is to the sprout of David ([Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005).md), already called simply David in
[Hos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md) and [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md). In [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md) the relation of Jehovah to this
David is more precisely defined: Jehovah will then be God to His people,
and David be prince in the midst of them. The last words point back to
[Sa2 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008.md). Through the government of
David, Jehovah will become in truth God of His people Israel; for David
will feed the people in perfect unity with Jehovah, - will merely carry
out the will of Jehovah, and not place himself in opposition to God,
like the bad shepherds, because, as is therewith presupposed, he is
connected with God by unity of nature.

In [Eze 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md). the thought is carried
out still further, - how God will become God to His people, and prove
Himself to be its covenant God through the pastoral fidelity of the
future David. God will fully accomplish the covenant mercies promised to
Israel. The making of the covenant of peace need not be restricted, in
accordance with [Hos 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#020) (18.md), to a
covenant which God would make with the beasts in favour of His people.
The thought is a more comprehensive one here, and, according to [Lev
26:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004.md), the passage which Ezekiel had
in his mind involves all the salvation which God had included in His
promises to His people: viz., (1) the extermination of everything that
could injure Israel, of all the wild beasts, so that they would be able
to sleep securely in the deserts and the forests ([Eze
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md), compare [Lev
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#006)); (2.md) the pouring out of an
abundant rain, so that the field and land would yield rich produce ([Eze
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#026.md), [Eze
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#027.md); cf. [Lev
26:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004).md). "I make them, the Israelites,
and the surroundings of my hill, a blessing." גּבעתי, the hill of
Jehovah, is, according to [Isa 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md),
Mount Zion, the temple-mountains, including the city of Jerusalem. The
surroundings of this hill are the land of Israel, that lay around it.
But Zion, with the land around, is not mentioned in the place of the
inhabitants; and still less are we to understand by the surroundings of
the hill the heathen nations, as Hengstenberg does, in opposition both
to the context and the usage of the language. The thought is simply that
the Lord will make both the people and the land a blessing (Hvernick,
Kliefoth). בּרכה, a blessing, is stronger than "blessed" (cf. [Gen
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002).md). The blessing is brought by the
rain in its season, which fertilizes the earth. This will take place
when the Lord breaks the yokes laid upon His people. These words are
from [Lev 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013.md), where they refer to
the deliverance of Israel from the bondage of Egypt; and they are
transferred by Ezekiel to the future redemption of Israel from the
bondage of the heathen. For עבדים , compare [Exo
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#014.md). This thought is carried out
still further in [Eze 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#028.md); and then,
in [Eze 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#029.md), all that has been said
is summed up in the thoughts, "I raise up for them a plantation for a
name," etc. מטּע, a plantation, as in [Eze
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#007.md); not a land for planting
(Hitzig). לשׁם, for a name, i.e., not for the glory of God (De Wette);
but the plantation, which the Lord will cause to grow by pouring down
showers of blessing ([Eze 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#026).md), is
to bring renown to the Israelites, namely, among the heathen, who will
see from this that Israel is a people blessed by its God. This
explanation of the words is supplied by the following clause: they shall
no more be swept away by famine in the land, and no more bear the
disgrace of the heathen, i.e., the disgrace which the heathen heaped
upon Israel when in distress (compare [Zep
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019.md); [Jer
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011.md); and the primary passage, Deut.
26:29). From this blessing they will learn that Jehovah their God is
with them, and Israel is His people. The promise concludes in [Eze
34:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#031.md) with these words, which set a
seal upon the whole: "Ye are my flock, the flock of my pasture (lit., my
pasture-flock; צאן , [Jer 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md), the
flock fed by God Himself); men are ye, I am your God." That these last
words to not serve merely as an explanation of the figurative expression
"flock," is a fact of which no proof is needed. The figure of a flock
was intelligible to every one. The words "call attention to the depth
and greatness of the divine condescension, and meet the objection of men
of weak faith, that man, who is taken from the earth האדמה, and returns
to it again, is incapable of so intimate a connection with God"
(Hengstenberg).

If we take another survey, in conclusion, of the contents of our
prophecy, the following are the three features of the salvation promised
to the people of Israel: - (1) The Lord will liberate His people from
the hand of the bad shepherds, and He Himself will feed it as His flock;
(2) He will gather it together from its dispersion, bring it back to the
land of Israel and feed it there, will take charge of the sheep in need
of help, and destroy the fat and strong sheep by which the weak ones are
oppressed; (3) He will raise up the future David for a shepherd, and
under his care He will bestow upon His people the promised covenant
blessings in richest measure. These saving acts of God for His people,
however, are not depicted according to their several details and
historical peculiarities, as Kliefoth has correctly observed, nor are
they narrated in the chronological order in which they would follow one
another in history; but they are grouped together according to their
general design and character, and their essential features. If, then, we
seek for the fulfilment, the Lord raised up His servant David as a
shepherd to Israel, by sending Jesus Christ, who came to seek and to
save that which was lost ([Luk 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010.md);
[Mat 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#011).md), and who calls Himself the
Good Shepherd with obvious reference to this and other prophetic
declarations of a similar kind ([Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011)..md). But the sending of Christ was
preceded by the gathering of Israel out of the Babylonian exile, by
which God had already taken charge of His flock, Yet, inasmuch as only a
small portion of Israel received the Messiah, who appeared in Jesus, as
its shepherd, there fell upon the unbelieving Israel a new judgment of
dispersion among all nations, which continues still, so that a gathering
together still awaits the people of Israel at some future time. No
distinction is made in the prophecy before us between these two
judgments of dispersion, which are associated with the twofold gathering
of Israel; but they are grouped together as one, so that although their
fulfilment commenced with the deliverance of Israel from the Babylonian
captivity and the coming of Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd of the
family of David, it was only realized in that portion of Israel,
numerically the smallest portion, which was willing to be gathered and
fed by Jesus Christ, and the full realization will only be effected when
that conversion of Israel shall take place, which the Apostle Paul
foretells in [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md). - For further
remarks on the ultimate fulfilment, we refer the reader to a later page.
