[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

Song of Thanksgiving after Recovery from Dangerous Sickness

The summons to praise God which is addressed to the angels above in [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md), is directed in [Psa
30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001.md) to the pious here below. There
is nothing against the adoption of the לדוד. Hitzig again in this
instance finds all kinds of indications of Jeremiah's hand; but the
parallels in Jeremiah are echoes of the Psalms, and דלּיתני in [Psa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#002.md) does not need to be explained of
a lowering into a tank or dungeon, it is a metaphorical expression for
raising up out of the depths of affliction. Even Hezekiah's song of
thanksgiving in Isa 38 has grown out of the two closing strophes of this
Psalm under the influence of an intimate acquaintance with the Book of
Job. We are therefore warranted in supposing that it is David, who here,
having in the midst of the stability of his power come to the verge of
the grave, and now being roused from all carnal security, as one who has
been rescued, praises the Lord, whom he has made his refuge, and calls
upon all the pious to join with him in his song. The Psalm bears the
inscription: A Song-Psalm at the Dedication of the House, by David. This
has been referred to the dedication of the site of the future Temple, 2
Sam; [Ch1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001.md); but although the place
of the future Temple together with the altar then erected on it, can be
called בּית יהוה ([Ch1 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001).md), and
might also at any rate be called absolutely הבּית (as הר הבית, the
Temple hill); yet we know that David did not himself suffer ([Sa2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017).md) from the pestilence, which
followed as a punishment upon the numbering of the people which he
instituted in his arrogant self-magnification. The Psalm, however, also
does not contain anything that should point to a dedication of a
sanctuary, whether Mount Moriah, or the tabernacle, [Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md). It might more naturally be
referred to the re-consecration of the palace, that was defiled by
Absolom, after David's return; but the Psalm mentions some imminent
peril, the gracious averting of which does not consist in the turning
away of bloodthirsty foes, but in recovery from some sickness that might
have proved fatal. Thus then it must be the dedication of the citadel on
Zion, the building of which was just completed. From [Sa2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#012.md) we see that David regarded this
building as a pledge of the stability and exaltation of his kingdom; and
all that is needed in order to understand the Psalm is, with Aben-Ezra,
Flaminius, Crusius, and Vaihinger, to infer from the Psalm itself, that
David had been delayed by some severe illness from taking possession of
the new building. The situation of [Psa
16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md) is just like it. The regular
official title אשׁר על־הבּית (majordomo) shows, that הבית, used thus
absolutely, may denote the palace just as well as the Temple. The lxx
which renders it τοῦ ἐγκαινισμοῦ τοῦ οἴκου (τοῦ) Δαυίδ, understands the
palace, not the Temple. In the Jewish ritual, [Psa
30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001.md) is certainly, as is even
stated in the Tractate Sofrim xviii. 2, the Psalm for the feast of
Chanucca, or Dedication, which refers to 1 Macc. 4:52ff.

[Psalms 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 30:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 30:2-4) The Psalm begins like a hymn. The Piel דּלּה (from דּלה,
Arab. dlâ, to hold anything long, loose and pendulous, whether upwards
or downwards, conj. V Arab. tdllâ=, to dangle) signifies to lift or draw
up, like a bucket (דּלי, Greek ἀντλίον, Latin tollo, tolleno in Festus).
The poet himself says what that depth is into which he had sunk and out
of which God had drawn him up without his enemies rejoicing over him (לי
as in [Psa 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002).md), i.e., without
allowing them the wished for joy at his destruction: he was brought down
almost into Hades in consequence of some fatal sickness. חיּה (never: to
call into being out of nothing) always means to restore to life that
which has apparently or really succumbed to death, or to preserve
anything living in life. With this is easily and satisfactorily joined
the Kerמ מיּרדי בור (without Makkeph in the correct text), ita ut non
descenderem; the infinitive of ירד in this instance following the
analogy of the strong verb is ירד, like יבשׁ, ישׁון, and with suffix
jordi (like josdi, [Job 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004).md) or
jaaredi, for here it is to be read thus, and not jordi (vid., on [Psa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md); [Psa
86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002).md).

(Note: The Masora does not place the word under יו וחטפין קמציןאלין
תיבותא יתירין ו (Introduction 28b), as one would expect to find it if it
were to be read mijordi, and proceeds on the assumption that mijārdi is
infinitive like עמדך (read ‛amādcha) [Oba
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011), not participle (Ewald, S. 533)..md)

The Chethb מיורדי might also be the infinitive, written with Cholem
plenum, as an infinitive [Gen 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#020.md),
and an imperative [Num 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#008.md), is each
pointed with Cholem instead of Kamtez chatuph; but it is probably
intended to be read as a participle, מיּורדי: Thou hast revived me from
those who sink away into the grave ([Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001).md), or out of the state of such
(cf. [Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022).md) - a perfectly
admissible and pregnant construction.

[Psalms 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 30:4</span></span>

(Heb.: 30:5-6) [Psa 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004.md) call upon all
the pious to praise this God, who after a short season of anger is at
once and henceforth gracious. Instead of שׁם of Jahve, we find the
expression זכר in this instance, as in [Psa
97:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#012.md) after [Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015.md). Jahve, by revealing Himself,
renders Himself capable of being both named and remembered, and that in
the most illustrious manner. The history of redemption is, as it were,
an unfolding of the Name of Jahve and at the same time a setting up of a
monument, an establishment of a memorial, and in fact the erection of a
זכר קדשׁ; because all God's self-attestations, whether in love or in
wrath, flow from the sea of light of His holiness. When He manifests
Himself to His won love prevails; and wrath is, in relation to them,
only a vanishing moment: a moment passes in His anger, a (whole) life in
His favour, i.e., the former endures only for a moment, the latter the
whole life of a man. "Alles Ding whrt seine Zeit, Gottes Lieb' in
Ewigkeit." All things last their season, God's love to all eternity. The
preposition בּ does not here, as in the beautiful parallel [Isa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007.md)., cf. [Psa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#010.md), denote the time and mode of
that which takes place, but the state in which one spends the time. [Psa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006.md) portrays the rapidity with which
love takes back wrath (cf. [Isa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#014).md): in the evening weeping takes
up its abode with us for the night, but in the morning another guest,
viz., רנּה, appears, like a rescuing angel, before whom בּכי disappears.
The predicate ילין etaci does not belong to [Psa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006) as well (Hupfeld, Hitzig.md). The
substantival clause: and in the morning joy = joy is present, depicts
the unexpectedness and surprise of the help of Him who sends בכי and
רנה.

[Psalms 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 30:6</span></span>

(Heb.: 30:7-8) David now relates his experience in detail, beginning
with the cause of the chastisement, which he has just undergone. In ואני
אמרתּי (as in [Psa 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md); [Psa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004).md) he contrasts his former
self-confidence, in which (like the רשׁע, [Psa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006).md) he thought himself to be
immoveable, with the God-ward trust he has now gained in the school of
affliction. Instead of confiding in the Giver, he trusted in the gift,
as though it had been his own work. It is uncertain, - but it is all the
same in the end, - whether שׁלוי is the inflected infinitive שלו of the
verb שׁלי (which we adopt in our translation), or the inflected noun
שׁלו (שׁלוּ) = שׁלו, after the form שׂחוּ, a swimming, [Eze
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#005.md), = שׁלוה, [Jer
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#021.md). The inevitable consequence of
such carnal security, as it is more minutely described in [Deu
8:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#011.md), is some humbling divine
chastisement. This intimate connection is expressed by the perfects in
[Psa 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#008.md), which represent God's
pardon, God's withdrawal of favour, which is brought about by his
self-exaltation, and the surprise of his being undeceived, as
synchronous. העמיד עז, to set up might is equivalent to: to give it as a
lasting possession; cf. [Ch2 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#008.md),
which passage is a varied, but not (as Riehm supposes) a corrupted,
repetition of [Kg2 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#008.md). It is,
therefore, unnecessary, as Hitzig does, to take ל as accusatival and עז
as adverbial: in Thy favour hadst Thou made my mountain to stand firm.
The mountain is Zion, which is strong by natural position and by the
additions of art ([Sa2 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009).md); and this,
as being the castle-hill, is the emblem of the kingdom of David: Jahve
had strongly established his kingdom for David, when on account of his
trust in himself He made him to feel how all that he was he was only by
Him, and without Him he was nothing whatever. The form of the inflexion
הררי, instead of הרי = harri, is defended by [Gen
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006.md) and [Jer
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003.md) (where it is הררי as if from
הרר). The reading להדרי (lxx, Syr.), i.e., to my kingly dignity is a
happy substitution; whereas the reading of the Targum להררי, "placed
(me) on firm mountains," at once refutes itself by the necessity for
supplying "me."

[Psalms 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 30:8</span></span>

(Heb.: 30:9-11) Nevertheless he who is thus chastened prayed fervently.
The futures in [Psa 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#009.md), standing as
they do in the full flow of the narration, have the force of imperfects,
of "the present in the past" as the Arabian grammarians call it. From
the question "What profit is there (the usual expression for τίὄφελος,
quid lucri) in my blood?", it is not to be inferred that David was in
danger of death by the hand of a foe; for ותרפאני in [Psa
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#003.md) teaches us very different, "what
profit would there be in my blood?" is therefore equivalent to (cf. [Job
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#018).md) what advantage would there be
in Thy slaying me before my time? On the contrary God would rob Himself
of the praise, which the living one would render to Him, and would so
gladly render. His request that his life may be prolonged was not,
therefore, for the sake of worldly possessions and enjoyment, but for
the glory of God. He feared death as being the end of the praise of God.
For beyond the grave there will be no more psalms sung, [Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md). In the Old Testament, Hades was
as yet unvanquished, Heaven was not yet opened. In Heaven are the בני
אלים, but as yet no blessed בני אדם.

[Psalms 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 30:11</span></span>

(Heb.: 30:12-13) In order to express the immediate sequence of the
fulfilling of the prayer upon the prayer itself, the otherwise (e.g.,
[Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005).md) usual ו of conjunction is
omitted; on הפכתּ וגו cf. the echoes in [Jer
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#013.md); [Lam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#015.md). According to our interpretation
of the relation of the Psalm to the events of the time, there is as
little reason for thinking of [Sa2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014.md) in connection with מחול, as of
[Ch1 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016.md) in connection with שׂקּי.
In place of the garment of penitence and mourning (cf. מחגרת שׂק, [Isa
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024).md) slung round the body (perhaps
fastened only with a cord) came a girding up (אזּר, synon. חגר [Psa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013), whence אזור, חגרה.md) with joy.
The designed result of such a speedy and radical change in his
affliction, after it had had the salutary effect of humbling him, was
the praise of Jahve: in order that my glory (כּבוד for כּבודי = נפשׁי,
as in [Psa 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006.md); [Psa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md); [Psa
108:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#002).md) may sing Thy praises without
ceasing (ידּם fut. Kal). And the praise of Jahve for ever is moreover
his resolve, just as he vows, and at the same time carries it out, in
this Psalm.
