Elevation of Esther to the Throne - Esther 2

Service Rendered by Mordochai to the King

When the wrath of King Ahashverosh was appeased, and he remembered his
harsh treatment of Vashti, his courtiers proposed that he should send to
fetch fair young virgins from all parts of his realm to the house of the
women in Susa, that he might choose a new queen from among them. This
proposal pleasing the king, was acted upon ([Est
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#001).md). In the fortress of Susa,
however, there dwelt one of the Jews who had been carried into captivity
from Jerusalem, and whose name was Mordochai. This man had brought up
Esther, his uncle's daughter, as his own child ([Est
2:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#005).md). When, then, in pursuance with
the king's commands, many maidens were gathered together in Susa, Esther
also was brought into the king's house, and found favour with the keeper
of the women while, according to order, she was going through a course
of purification and anointing ([Est
2:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#008).md). Then her turn came to be
brought before the king, she found favour in his sight above all the
other maidens, and was chosen by him to be queen in the place of Vashti.
By Mordochai's command, however, she disclosed her race and lineage to
no one ([Est 2:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015).md). At the same
time two courtiers conspired against the life of the sovereign. Their
conspiracy being discovered by Mordochai, was by him revealed to Esther,
who gave information of it to the king, whereupon the matter was
investigated, and found to have been correctly stated. The offenders
were punished, and the event duly registered in the chronicles of the
kingdom.

[Esther 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 2:1</span></span>

When, after these things, the wrath of King Ahashverosh was laid (שׁך,
from שׁכך, to be sunk, spoken of wrath to be laid), he remembered Vashti
and what she had done, and what was decreed against her (גּזר, to
determine, to decree irrevocably; comp. גּזרה, [Dan
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#014).md); a desire for reunion with her
evidently making itself felt, accompanied perhaps by the thought that
she might have been too harshly treated. To prevent, then, a return of
affection for his rejected wife ensuing, - a circumstance which might
greatly endanger all who had concurred in effecting her repudiation, -
the servants of the king, i.e., the court officials who were about him,
said: "Let there be young maidens, virgins fair to look on, sought for
the king." בּתוּלות, virgins, is added to נערות, the latter word
signifying merely young women of marriageable age. [Est
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003.md). "And let the king appoint (ויפקד
is the continuation of יבקּשׁוּ) officers in all the provinces of his
kingdom, that they may gather together every virgin who is fair to look
on to the citadel of Susa, to the house of the women, unto the hand of
Hega the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, and let them appoint
their things for purification; and let the maiden which pleaseth the
king be queen instead of Vashti." To the hand of Hega, i.e., to his care
and superintendence, under which, as appears from [Est
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012.md), every maiden received into the
house of the women had to pass a year before she was brought before the
king. Hega (called Hegai, [Est 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#008.md) and
[Est 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015).md) was an eunuch, the keeper
of the women, i.e., superintendent of the royal harem. ונתון is the
infin. abs., used instead of the verb. fin. to give prominence to the
matter: let them appoint. תּמרקום, from מרק, to rub, to polish,
signifies purification and adornment with all kind of precious
ointments; comp. [Est 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012.md). This
speech pleased the king, and he acted accordingly.

[Esther 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">est 2:5</span></span>

Before relating how this matter was carried into execution, the
historian introduces us to the two persons who play the chief parts in
the following narrative. [Est 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#005.md).
There was (dwelt) in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the name of Mordochai
(מרדּכי, in more correct editions מרדכי), the son of Jair, the son of
Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite (ימיני אישׁ like [Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001).md). Jair, Shimei, and Kish can
hardly mean the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather of Mordochai.
On the contrary, if Jair were perhaps his father, Shimei and Kish may
have been the names of renowned ancestors. Shimei was probably the son
of Gera, well known to us from the history of David, [Sa2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005.md). and [Kg1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008.md), [Kg1
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#036.md)., and Kish the father of Saul,
[Ch1 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033.md); [Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md); for in genealogical series only a
few noted names are generally given; comp., e.g., [Ch1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md); [Ch1
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#024.md). Upon the ground of this
explanation, Josephus (Ant. xi. 6) makes Esther of royal descent, viz.,
of the line of Saul, king of Israel; and the Targum regards Shimei as
the Benjamite who cursed David. The name Mordochai occurs in [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md) and [Neh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#007.md) as that of some other individual
among those who returned from captivity with Zerubbabel, but can hardly
be connected with the Persian mrdky, little man. Aben Ezra, Lightfoot,
and others, indeed, are of opinion that the Mordochai of the present
book really came up with Zerubbabel, but subsequently returned to
Babylon. Identity of name is not, however, a sufficient proof of
identity of person. The chronological statement, [Est
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#006.md) : who had been carried away from
Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah,
king of Judah, etc., offers some difficulty. For from the captivity of
Jeconiah in the year 599 to the beginning of the reign of Xerxes (in the
year 486) is a period of 113 years; hence, if the אשׁר is referred to
Mordochai, he would, even if carried into captivity as a child by then,
have reached the age of from 120 to 130 years, and as Esther was not
made queen till the seventh year of Xerxes ([Est
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#016).md), would have become prime
minister of that monarch at about the age of 125. Rambach, indeed, does
not find this age incredible, though we cannot regard it as probable
that Mordochai should have become minister at so advanced an age.

(Note: Baumg. aptly remarks, l.c., p. 125: Etsi concedendum est, non
esse contra naturam, si Mordechaeus ad illam aetatem pervenerit, et
summa hac constitutus senectute gravissimis negotiis perficiendis par
fuerit, tamen est hoc rarissimum et nisi accedit certum testimonium,
difficile ad credendum.)

On this account Clericus, Baumgarten, and others refer the relative אשׁר
to the last name, Kish, and understand that he was carried away with
Jeconiah, while his great-grandson Mordochai was born in captivity. In
this case Kish and Shimei must be regarded as the great-grandfather and
grandfather of Mordochai. We grant the possibility of this view;
nevertheless it is more in accordance with the Hebrew narrative style to
refer אשׁר to the chief person of the sentence preceding it, viz.,
Mordochai, who also continues to be spoken of in [Est
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#007.md). Hence we prefer this reference,
without, however, attributing to Mordochai more than 120 years of age.
For the relative clause: who had been carried away, need not be so
strictly understood as to assert that Mordochai himself was carried
away; but the object being to give merely his origin and lineage, and
not his history, it involves only the notion that he belonged to those
Jews who were carried to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar with Jeconiah, so
that he, though born in captivity, was carried to Babylon in the persons
of his forefathers. This view of the passage corresponds with that
formerly presented by the list of the grandchildren and
great-grandchildren of Jacob who went down with him to Egypt; see the
explanation of the passage in question.

(Note: Baumgarten also considers this view admissible, rightly
remarking, p. 127: Scriptoribus sacris admodum familiare est singulos
homines non per se et sepositos spectare, sed familias et gentes ut
corpora quasi individua complecti, ita ut posteri majorum personis quasi
contenti et inclusi, majores vero in posteris ipsi subsistere et vivere
existimentur. Ex hac ratione Mordechaeus captus esse dici potest,
quamvis ipse satis diu post Jechoniae tempora ex iis, qui a
Nebucadnezaro abducti sunt, natus fuerit.)

[Est 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#007.md). Mordochai was אמן, keeper,
bringer up, i.e., foster-father, to Hadassh (אמן constructed as a
participle with את). הדסּה means a myrtle (הדס in the Shemitish), like
the Greek name Μυρτία, Μυῤῥίνη. "That is Esther," the queen known by the
name of Esther. The name אסתּר is the Old-Persian stara with א
prosthetic, and corresponds with the Greek ἀστήρ, star, in modern
Persian sitareh. She was בּת־דּדו, daughter of his father's brother, and
adopted by Mordochai after the death of her parents; we are told,
moreover, that she had a fine figure and beautiful countenance. Her
father, whose name, according to [Est
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015.md), was Abihail, was uncle to
Mordochai, and hence Esther was his cousin.

[Esther 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 2:8</span></span>

When, then, the king's commandment and decree was heard, i.e.,
proclaimed throughout the kingdom, and many maidens gathered together in
Susa, Esther also was received into the royal harem, under the keeping
of Hegai. The maiden pleased him and won his favour (חסד נשׂא, to bear
away love, i.e., to obtain favour, synonymous with חן נשׂא, [Est
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015.md) and [Est
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#002).md). וגו ויבהל, and he hastened to
give her her ointments for purification, and the seven maidens appointed
to her from the king's house. The infinitives להּ לתת are, according to
the Aramaean idiom, placed after their objects and dependent on יבהל. On
תּמרוּקים, see on [Est 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003.md). מנות,
portions, are here portions of food, as in [Est
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#019.md), [Est
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#022.md), and [Sa1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#004.md). The seven maidens (הנּערות with
the article) are the maids appointed to wait upon a young virgin
selected for the king. The participle ראיּות: chosen for a particular
purpose-in the Talmud and rabbinical Hebrew ראוּי, dignus, decens,
conveniens, - occurs only here. ישׁנּה, he changed her and her maids
into the best of the house of the women, i.e., he took them out of the
ordinary rooms and placed them in the best apartments, probably in the
state-rooms, where those who were accustomed to be brought to the king
used to dwell.

[Esther 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">est 2:10</span></span>

[Est 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#010.md) contains a supplementary
remark. This kind and respectful treatment was shown to Esther, because,
in obedience to Mordochai's command, she had not shown her people nor
her kindred, i.e., her Jewish extraction; for a Jewish maiden would
hardly have experienced such friendly usage. [Est
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#011.md) also contains an additional
notice, prefixed here to enable what follows to be rightly understood,
and repeated in another connection [Est
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019.md), and on several other occasions:
Mordochai walked every day before the court or enclosure of the women's
house, to know the welfare (שׁלום) of Esther and what became of her (בּה
יעשׂה, properly, what was done to her). Hence Mordochai was in constant
communication with Esther. How this communication was effected is not
more particularly stated; probably by means of the maids appointed to
wait on her. Jewish expositors are of opinion, that Mordochai held high
office, and that having consequently free access to the royal palace, he
could easily find the means of communicating with his relative.

[Esther 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">est 2:12</span></span>

Before relating the appearance of Esther before the king, the narrator
more particularly describes in [Est
2:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012.md) the preparations for this
event, and how Esther behaved with respect to them.

[Est 2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012.md)

"When every maid's turn came (i.e., at every time that any maid's turn
came) to go in to King Ahashverosh, after the time when it had been done
to her twelve months according to the law of the women - for thus were
the days of their purification accomplished: six months with oil of
myrrh, and six months with balsam and ointments of purification for
women - and the maiden came to the king, all that she desired was given
her to go with her out of the women's house unto the king's house."
תּור, turn in succession, used only here and [Est
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015.md). The turn to go in unto the king
did not come to any maid until וגו היות מקּץ, at the end of the time
when it had been done to her according to the law ... This time lasted
twelve months after her reception into the house of the women; and the
law of the women, according to which it was done to her, was, that she
should be purified for six months with oil of myrrh, and as long with
בּשׂמים, sweet odours and other ointments. בּאה הנּערה וּבזה ([Est
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#013).md) forms the continuation of the
antecedent clause commencing with כּהנּיע, or, to speak more correctly,
of a second antedecent with which the conclusion כּל־אשׁר את is
connected. Some expositors understand בּזה, with the lxx, of the time:
illo sc. tempore; others of the condition: hoc modo ornata or ea lege
(Cler.), and therefore as parallel in meaning with the כּן of [Est
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md). Either view is admissible and
suits the sense, but the latter is more in harmony with the parallel
passage [Est 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md), and therefore
preferable. All that was to be given her, can only relate to ornaments
and jewels, which were to be given that each might appear before the
king adorned and dressed after her own taste.

[Est 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#014.md)

In the evening she went (to the king), and on the morrow she returned to
the women's house, a second (time) to the hand (under the keeping of)
Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines; she came no
more to the king, except the king delighted in her and she were called
by name, i.e., specially. שׁני instead of שׁנית, like [Neh
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#030.md).

[Est 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015.md)

When Esther's turn came to go in unto the king, she required nothing (to
take with her, see [Est 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#013).md) but what
Hegai the king's chamberlain appointed (hence as not concerned to please
the king by special adornment), and she obtained favour in the sight of
all them that looked upon her, namely, by her modesty and humility. On
חן נשׂא, see remarks on [Est 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#009.md).

[Est 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#016.md)

She was taken into the king's house (מלכוּת בּית instead of המּלך בּית,
the palace of the kingdom, the royal residence) in the tenth month,
i.e., the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.

[Est 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#017.md)

And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace
and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; and he set the royal
crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. The meaning
evidently is, that the king, immediately after their first meeting,
bestowed his affections upon Esther in preference to all the women and
maidens, and chose her queen.

[Est 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#018.md)

To celebrate Esther's elevation to the crown, the king made a great
feast, called Esther's feast, to all his princes and servants, and
granted release to the provinces. The verbale Hiph. הנחה is translated
in the lxx ἄφεσις, Vulg. requies, and understood either of a remission
of taxes or a remission of labour, a holiday. Although the Chald.
understands it of a remission of taxes, yet the use of the verb עשׂה
rather favours the latter meaning, viz., the appointment of a holiday,
on which there would be arresting from labour. Finally, he gave gifts
with royal munificence משׂאת like [Amo
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md); [Jer
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#005.md); המּלך כּיד like [Est
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#007.md). - It seems strange that a period
of four years should intervene between the repudiation of Vashti in the
third year of Ahashverosh and the elevation of Esther in the seventh, an
interval whose length cannot be adequately accounted for by the
statements of the present book. Only a few days could have elapsed
between the disgrace of Vashti and the time when the king remembered
her; for this took place, we are told, when the king's wrath was
appeased. The proposal to collect virgins from all parts of his kingdom
to Susa was then immediately made. Now, if the carrying out of this
proposal took half a year, and the preparation of the virgins by
anointing, etc., lasted a year, Esther, even if her turn to go in unto
the king had not come for six months, might have been made queen two
years after the repudiation of Vashti. As she obtained the favour of
Hegai immediately upon her reception into the women's house, so that he
hastened her purifications ([Est 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#009).md),
she would not be brought before the king among the last, but would
rather be one of the first to go in. The long interval which elapsed
between the repudiation of Vashti and the elevation of Esther, can only
be satisfactorily explained by the history of the reign of Xerxes; in
fact, by the circumstance that his campaign against Greece took place
during this time.

[Esther 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">est 2:19</span></span>

[Est 2:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019.md) relate the intervention
of an incident of great importance in the subsequent development of the
narrative. When virgins were for the second time gathered together, two
courtiers were incensed with the king, and sought to lay hands upon him.
This thing was known to Mordochai, who sat in the gate of the palace and
kept up a constant communication with Esther even after she became
queen, and by him communicated to her, that she might bring it to the
knowledge of the king. The matter being investigated and found to have
been truly reported, the offenders were punished, and an entry of the
particulars made in the chronicles of the kingdom. The words "when
virgins were assembled for the second time," which serve to define the
time when the conspiracy of the two courtiers took place, as is obvious
from the circumstance that ההם בּיּמים, [Est
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021.md), refers to בת בּהקּבץ, [Est
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019.md), are obscure. The obscurity lies
in the fact that no reason for assembling virgins can be perceived,
after the choice of Ahashverosh had fallen upon Esther. The sentence
שׁנית בּתוּלות וּבהקּבץ unmistakeably corresponds with נערות וּבהקּבץ of
v. 8. This was already rightly perceived by Grotius, who, however,
wrongly infers: est ἐπάνοδος (retrogressio), referendum enim hoc ad illa
quae supra, ii. 2. This is, however, not only incompatible with שׁנית,
but also with the circumstance that, according to the correct
understanding of the sentences in [Est
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021.md) and [Est
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#022.md), Esther was then already queen,
and Mordochai was sitting in the gate of the king's palace, and thence
keeping up communication with her; while as long as Esther was in the
women's house preparing for her interview with the king, under the
guardianship of Hegai, he walked day by day before the court of the
women's house ([Est 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#011).md). Still less
admissible is the view of Drusius, received by Bertheau, that the
gathering of the virgins for the second time is to be understood from
the circumstance, that after going in to the king, they had to go into
the second house of the women, under the stricter guardianship of
Shaashgaz ([Est 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#014).md). For, being no
longer בּתוּלות, but פּילגשׁים ([Est
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#014).md), their reception into the house
of the concubines could not be called a second gathering together, since
as virgins they were formerly in a different house. The only explanation
of the שׁנית left us is the view, that even after the choice of Esther
to be queen, a second gathering together of virgins actually took place;
for this, as C. a Lapide remarks, is what the words undoubtedly declare.
The matter itself was in accordance with the prevailing custom of
polygamy, which kings carried to such an extent, that, as C. a Lapide
points out, Solomon, e.g., had 700 wives and 300 concubines, i.e.,
secondarias uxores. From וּמרדּכי, [Est
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019.md), onwards, explanatory
circumstantial clauses follow: "The Mordochai sat in the king's gate"
introduces the parenthetical sentence, "Esther had not yet showed her
kindred and her people (comp. [Est
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#010).md), as Mordochai had charged her;
for Esther did the commandment of Mordochai as when she was under his
care;" i.e., Esther obeyed, after her elevation to be queen, the command
of Mordochai not to make her Jewish descent known, as she had formerly
done while she was yet his foster-daughter. אמנה, care, education, is a
substantive derived from אמן.

[Esther 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">est 2:21</span></span>

The definition of time in [Est 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019.md) is
again take up by the words: in those days; then the explanatory clause,
[Est 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#020.md), is repeated; and after this
we are informed what it was that had then occurred. In those days
Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's courtiers, who were the
threshold-keepers (palace-watchers, lxx ἀρχισωματοφύλακες), were wroth,
and sought to lay hands on King Ahashverosh, i.e., to slay him. [Est
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#022.md). This thing was known to
Mordochai, and by him communicated to Esther, who told it, in
Mordochai's name, to the king. [Est
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#023.md). The matter was investigated (sc.
by the king), and found out, sc. as Mordochai had testified. The two
criminals were hanged on a tree, i.e., impaled on a stake, a sort of
crucifixion, - see rem. on [Est 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#011.md),
- and the circumstance entered in the book of the chronicles, i.e., the
chronicles of the kingdom. המּלך לפני, before the king, i.e., in his
presence, immediately after sentence had been passed by a court over
which the monarch presided.
