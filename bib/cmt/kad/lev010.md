### [Leviticus Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 10:1</span></span>

Nadab and Abihu took their censers (machtah, [Exo
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#038).md), and having put fire in them,
placed incense thereon, and brought strange fire before Jehovah, which
He had not commanded them. It is not very clear what the offence of
which they were guilty actually was. The majority of expositors suppose
the sin to have consisted in the fact, that they did not take the fire
for the incense from the altar-fire. But this had not yet been commanded
by God; and in fact it is never commanded at all, except with regard to
the incense-offering, with which the high priest entered the most holy
place on the day of atonement ([Lev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012).md), though we may certainly infer
from this, that it was also the rule for the daily incense-offering. By
the fire which they offered before Jehovah, we are no doubt to
understand the firing of the incense-offering. This might be called
"strange fire" if it was not offered in the manner prescribed in the
law, just as in [Exo 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009.md) incense not
prepared according to the direction of God is called "strange incense."
The supposition that they presented an incense-offering that was not
commanded in the law, and apart from the time of the morning and evening
sacrifice, and that this constituted their sin, is supported by the time
at which their illegal act took place. It is perfectly obvious from [Lev
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md). and 16ff. that it occurred in
the interval between the sacrificial transaction in ch. 9 and the
sacrificial meal which followed it, and therefore upon the day of their
inauguration. For in [Lev 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md) Moses
commands Aaron and his remaining sons Eleazar and Ithamar to eat the
meat-offering that was left from the firings of Jehovah, and inquires in
[Lev 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#016.md) for the goat of the
sin-offering, which the priests were to have eaten in a holy place.
Knobel's opinion is not an improbable one, therefore, that Nadab and
Abihu intended to accompany the shouts of the people with an
incense-offering to the praise and glory of God, and presented an
incense-offering not only at an improper time, but not prepared from the
altar-fire, and committed such a sin by this will-worship, that they
were smitten by the fire which came forth from Jehovah, even before
their entrance into the holy place, and so died "before Jehovah." The
expression "before Jehovah" is applied to the presence of God, both in
the dwelling (viz., the holy place and the holy of holies, e.g., [Lev
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006.md); [Lev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#013).md) and also in the court (e.g.,
[Lev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005), etc..md). It is in the latter
sense that it is to be taken here, as is evident from [Lev
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#004.md), where the persons slain are said
to have lain "before the sanctuary of the dwelling," i.e., in the court
of the tabernacle. The fire of the holy God ([Exo
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018).md), which had just sanctified the
service of Aaron as well-pleasing to God, brought destruction upon his
two eldest sons, because they had not sanctified Jehovah in their
hearts, but had taken upon themselves a self-willed service; just as the
same gospel is to one a savour of life unto life, and to another a
savour of death unto death ([Co2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016).md). - In [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md) Moses explains this judgment to
Aaron: "This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will sanctify Myself in
him that is nigh to Me, and will glorify Myself in the face of all the
people." אכּבד is unquestionably to be taken in the same sense as in
[Exo 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#004.md), [Exo
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#017.md); consequently אקּדשׁ is to be
taken in a reflective and not in a passive sense, in the [Eze
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#016.md). The imperfects are used as
aorists, in the sense of what God does at all times. But these words of
Moses are no "reproof to Aaron, who had not restrained the untimely zeal
of his sons" (Knobel), nor a reproach which made Aaron responsible for
the conduct of his sons, but a simple explanation of the judgment of
God, which should be taken to heart by every one, and involved an
admonition to all who heard it, not to Aaron only but to the whole
nation, to sanctify God continually in the proper way. Moreover Jehovah
had not communicated to Moses by revelation the words which he spoke
here, but had made the fact known by the position assigned to Aaron and
his sons through their election to the priesthood. By this act Jehovah
had brought them near to Himself ([Num
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005).md), made them קרבי = ליהוה קרבים
"persons standing near to Jehovah" ([Eze
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013.md); [Eze
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#019).md), and sanctified them to Himself
by anointing ([Lev 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010.md), [Lev
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#012.md); [Exo
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md), [Exo
29:44](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#044.md); [Exo
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#013.md), [Exo
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#015).md), that they might sanctify Him
in their office and life. If they neglected this sanctification, He
sanctified Himself in them by a penal judgment ([Eze
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#016).md), and thereby glorified Himself
as the Holy One, who is not to be mocked. "And Aaron held his peace." He
was obliged to acknowledge the righteousness of the holy God.

[Leviticus 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 10:4</span></span>

Moses then commanded Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel Aaron's
paternal uncle, Aaron's cousins therefore, to carry their brethren
(relations) who had been slain from before the sanctuary out of the
camp, and, as must naturally be supplied, to bury them there. The
expression, "before the sanctuary" (equivalent to "before the tabernacle
of the congregation" in [Lev 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#005).md),
shows that they had been slain in front of the entrance to the holy
place. They were carried out in their priests' body-coats, since they
had also been defiled by the judgment. It follows from this, too, that
the fire of Jehovah had not burned them up, but had simply killed them
as with a flash of lightning.

[Leviticus 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 10:6</span></span>

Moses prohibited Aaron and his remaining sons from showing any sign of
mourning on account of this fatal calamity. "Uncover not your heads,"
i.e., do not go about with your hair dishevelled, or flowing free and in
disorder ([Lev 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045).md). ראשׁ פּרע does
not signify merely uncovering the head by taking off the head-band (lxx,
Vulg., Kimchi, etc.), or by shaving off the hair (Ges. and others; see
on the other hand Knobel on [Lev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010).md), but is to be taken in a
similar sense ראשׁו שׂער פּרע, the free growth of the hair, not cut
short with scissors ([Num 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#005.md); [Eze
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#020).md). It is derived from פּרע, to
let loose from anything ([Pro 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#025.md);
[Pro 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#005), etc..md), to let a people
loose, equivalent to giving them the reins ([Exo
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025).md), and signifies solvere crines,
capellos, to leave the hair in disorder, which certainly implies the
laying aside of the head-dress in the case of the priest, though without
consisting in this alone. On this sign of mourning among the Roman and
other nations, see M. Geier de Ebraeorum luctu viii. 2. The Jews observe
the same custom still, and in times of deep mourning neither wash
themselves, nor cut their hair, nor pare their nails (see Buxtorf,
Synog. jud. p. 706). They were also not to rend their clothes, i.e., not
to make a rent in the clothes in front of the breast-a very natural
expression of grief, by which the sorrow of the heart was to be laid
bare, and one which was not only common among the Israelites ([Gen
37:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#029.md); [Gen
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#013.md); [Sa2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#011.md); [Sa2
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#031.md); [Sa2
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#031).md), but was very widely spread
among the other nations of antiquity (cf. Geier l.c. xxii. 9). פּרם, to
rend, occurs, in addition to this passage, in [Lev
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md); [Lev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010.md); in other places פרע, to tear in
pieces, is used. Aaron and his sons were to abstain from these
expressions of sorrow, "lest they should die and wrath come upon all the
people." Accordingly, we are not to seek the reason for this prohibition
merely in the fact, that they would defile themselves by contact with
the corpses, a reason which afterwards led to this prohibition being
raised into a general law for the high priest ([Lev
21:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010).md). The reason was simply this,
that any manifestation of grief on account of the death that had
occurred, would have indicated dissatisfaction with the judgment of God;
and Aaron and his sons would thereby not only have fallen into mortal
sin themselves, but have brought down upon the congregation the wrath of
God, which fell upon it through every act of sin committed by the high
priest in his official position ([Lev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003)). "Your brethren, (namely.md) the
whole house of Israel, may bewail this burning" (the burning of the
wrath of Jehovah). Mourning was permitted to the nation, as an
expression of sorrow on account of the calamity which had befallen the
whole nation in the consecrated priests. For the nation generally did
not stand in such close fellowship with Jehovah as the priests, who had
been consecrated by anointing.

[Leviticus 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 10:7</span></span>

The latter were not to go away from the door (the entrance or court of
the tabernacle), sc., to take part in the burial of the dead, lest they
should die, for the anointing oil of Jehovah was upon them. The
anointing oil was the symbol of the Spirit of God, which is a Spirit of
life, and therefore has nothing in common with death, but rather
conquers death, and sin, which is the source of death (cf. [Lev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#012).md).

[Leviticus 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 10:8</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, Jehovah still further commanded
Aaron and his sons not to drink wine and strong drink when they entered
the tabernacle to perform service there, on pain of death, as a
perpetual statute for their generations ([Exo
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#017).md), that they might be able to
distinguish between the holy and common, the clean and unclean, and also
to instruct the children of Israel in all the laws which God had spoken
to them through Moses (ו...ו, [Lev
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010.md) and [Lev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011), et...et, both...and also.md).
Shecar was an intoxicating drink made of barley and dates or honey. הל,
profanus, common, is a wider or more comprehensive notion than טמא,
unclean. Everything was common (profane) which was not fitted for the
sanctuary, even what was allowable for daily use and enjoyment, and
therefore was to be regarded as clean. The motive for laying down on
this particular occasion a prohibition which was to hold good for all
time, seems to lie in the event recorded in [Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md), although we can hardly infer
from this, as some commentators have done, that Nadab and Abihu offered
the unlawful incense-offering in a state of intoxication. The connection
between their act and this prohibition consisted simply in the rashness,
which had lost the clear and calm reflection that is indispensable to
right action.

[Leviticus 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 10:12</span></span>

After the directions occasioned by this judgment of God, Moses reminded
Aaron and his sons of the general laws concerning the consumption of the
priests' portions of the sacrifices, and their relation to the existing
circumstances: first of all ([Lev
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md), [Lev
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#013).md), of the law relating to the
eating of the meat-offering, which belonged to the priests after the
azcarah had been lifted off ([Lev 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md);
[Lev 6:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#009).md), and then ([Lev
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014.md), [Lev
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#015).md) of that relating to the
wave-breast and heave-leg ([Lev
7:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#032).md). By the minchah in [Lev
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md) we are to understand the meal
and oil, which were offered with the burnt-offering of the nation ([Lev
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#004.md) and [Lev
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#007).md); and by the אשּׁים in [Lev
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md) and [Lev
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#015.md), those portions of the
burnt-offering, meat-offering, and peace-offering of the nation which
were burned upon the altar ([Lev 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#013.md),
[Lev 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#017.md), and [Lev
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#020).md). He then looked for "the he-goat
of the sin-offering," - i.e., the flesh of the goat which had been
brought for a sin-offering ([Lev
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#015).md), and which was to have been
eaten by the priests in the holy place along with the sin-offerings,
whose blood was not taken into the sanctuary ([Lev
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#019.md), [Lev
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#022).md); - "and, behold, it was burned"
(שׂרף, 3 perf. Pual). Moses was angry at this, and reproved Eleazar and
Ithamar, who had attended to the burning: "Wherefore have ye not eaten
the sin-offering in a holy place?" he said; "for it is most holy, and He
(Jehovah) hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to
make atonement for it before Jehovah," as its blood had not been brought
into the holy place (הוּבא construed as a passive with an accusative, as
in [Gen 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#018), etc..md). "To bear the
iniquity" does not signify here, as in [Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md), to bear and atone for the sin in
its consequences, but, as in [Exo
28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038.md), to take the sin of another upon
one's self, for the purpose of cancelling it, to make expiation for it.
As, according to [Exo 28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038.md), the high
priest was to appear before the Lord with the diadem upon his forehead,
as the symbol of the holiness of his office, to cancel, as the mediator
of the nation and by virtue of his official holiness, the sin which
adhered to the holy gifts of the nation (see the note on this passage),
so here it is stated with regard to the official eating of the most holy
flesh of the sin-offering, which had been enjoined upon the priests,
that they were thereby to bear the sin of the congregation, to make
atonement for it. This effect or signification could only be ascribed to
the eating, by its being regarded as an incorporation of the victim
laden with sin, whereby the priests actually took away the sin by virtue
of the holiness and sanctifying power belonging to their office, and not
merely declared it removed, as Oehler explains the words (Herzog's Cycl.
x. p. 649). [Exo 28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038.md) is decisive in
opposition to the declaratory view, which does not embrace the meaning
of the words, and is not applicable to the passage at all.
"Incorporabant quasi peccatum populique reatum in se recipiebant"
(Deyling observv. ss. i. 45, 2).

(Note: C. a Lapide has given this correct interpretation of the passage:
"ut scilicet cum hostiis populi pro peccato simul etiam populi peccata
in vos quasi recipiatis, ut illa expietis." There is no foundation for
the objection offered by Oehler, that the actual removal of guilt and
the atonement itself were effected by the offering of the blood. For it
by no means follows from [Lev 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011.md),
that the blood, as the soul of the sacrificial animal, covered or
expiated the soul of the sinner, and that the removal and extinction of
the sin had already taken place with the covering of the soul before the
holy God, which involved the forgiveness of the sin and the reception of
the sinner to mercy.)

[Leviticus 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 10:19</span></span>

Aaron excused his sons, however, by saying, "Behold, this day have they
offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering, and this has
happened to me," i.e., the calamity recorded in [Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md). has befallen me (קרא = קרה, as
in [Gen 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#004).md); "and if I had eaten the
sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing to Jehovah?" וגו
ואכלתּי is a conditional clause, as in [Gen
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#013.md), cf. Ewald, 357. Moses rested
satisfied with this answer. Aaron acknowledged that the flesh of the
sin-offering ought to have been eaten by the priest in this instance
(according to [Lev 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#019).md), and simply
adduced, as the reason why this had not been done, the calamity which
had befallen his two eldest sons. And this might really be a sufficient
reason, as regarded both himself and his remaining sons, why the eating
of the sin-offering should be omitted. For the judgment in question was
so solemn a warning, as to the sin which still adhered to them even
after the presentation of their sin-offering, that they might properly
feel "that they had not so strong and overpowering a holiness as was
required for eating the general sin-offering" (M. Baumgarten). This is
the correct view, though others find the reason in their grief at the
death of their sons or brethren, which rendered it impossible to observe
a joyous sacrificial meal. But this is not for a moment to be thought
of, simply because the eating of the flesh of the sin-offering was not a
joyous meal at all (see at [Lev 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#019).md).

(Note: Upon this mistaken view of the excuse furnished by Aaron, Knobel
has founded his assertion, that "this section did not emanate from the
Elohist, because he could not have written in this way," an assertion
which falls to the ground when the words are correctly explained.)
