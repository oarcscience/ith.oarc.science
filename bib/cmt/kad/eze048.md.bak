### [Ezekiel Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 48:1</span></span>

The division of the land, like the definition of the boundaries ([Eze
47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015).md), commences in the north, and
enumerates the tribes in the order in which they were to receive their
inheritances from north to south: first, seven tribes from the northern
boundary to the centre of the land ([Eze
48:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001).md), where the heave for the
sanctuary, with the land of the priests and Levites and the city domain,
together with the prince's land on the two sides, was to be set apart
([Eze 48:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008.md); and secondly, the other
five tribes from this to the southern boundary ([Eze
48:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#023).md). Compare the map on Plate
IV.

[Eze 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md). And these are the names of
the tribes: from the north end by the side of the way to Chetlon toward
Hamath (and) Hazar-Enon the boundary of Damascus - toward the north by
the side of Hamath there shall east side, west side belong to him: Dan
one (tribe-lot). [Eze 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#002.md). And on the
boundary of Dan from the east side to the west side: Asher one. [Eze
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#003.md). And on the boundary of Asher
from the east side to the west side: Naphtali one. [Eze
48:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#004.md). And on the boundary of Naphtali
from the east side to the west side: Manasseh one. [Eze
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#005.md). And on the boundary of Manasseh
from the east side to the west side: Ephraim one. [Eze
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#006.md). And on the boundary of Ephraim
from the east side to the west side: Reuben one. [Eze
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#007.md). And on the boundary of Reuben
from the east side to the west side: Judah one. [Eze
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008.md). And on the boundary of Judah
from the east side to the west side shall be the heave, which ye shall
lift (heave) off, five and twenty thousand (rods) in breadth, and the
length like every tribe portion from the east side to the west side; and
the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it. [Eze
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#009.md). The heave which ye shall lift
(heave) for Jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand in length and ten
thousand in breadth. [Eze 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#010.md). And
to these shall the holy heave belong, to the priests, toward the north,
five and twenty thousand; toward the west, breadth ten thousand; toward
the east, breadth ten thousand; and toward the south, length five and
twenty thousand; and the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the middle of
it. [Eze 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#011.md). To the priests,
whoever is sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have kept my charge, who
have not strayed with the straying of the sons of Israel, as the Levites
have strayed, [Eze 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#012.md). To them
shall a portion lifted off belong from the heave of the land; a most
holy beside the territory of the Levites. [Eze
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#013). And the Levites (shall receive.md)
parallel with the territory of the priests five and twenty thousand in
length, and in breadth ten thousand; the whole length five and twenty
thousand, and (the whole) breadth ten thousand. [Eze
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#014.md). And they shall not sell or
exchange any of it, nor shall the first-fruit of the land pass to
others; for it is holy to Jehovah. [Eze
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015.md). And the five thousand which
remain in the breadth along the five and twenty thousand are common land
for the city for dwellings and for open space; and the city shall be in
the centre of it. [Eze 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016.md). And
these are its measures: the north side four thousand five hundred, the
south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five
hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred. [Eze
48:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#017.md). And the open space of the city
shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, toward the south two
hundred and fifty, toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the
west two hundred and fifty. [Eze
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#018.md). And the remainder in length
parallel with the holy heave, ten thousand toward the east and ten
thousand toward the west, this shall be beside the holy heave, and its
produce shall serve the workmen of the city for food. [Eze
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#019.md). And as for the workmen of the
city, they shall cultivate it from all the tribes. [Eze
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#020.md). The whole of the heave is five
and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand; a fourth of the holy
heave shall ye take for the possession of the city. [Eze
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#021.md). And the remainder shall belong
to the prince on this side and on that side of the holy heave and of the
city possession; along the five and twenty thousand of the heave to the
eastern boundary, and toward the west along the five and twenty thousand
to the western boundary parallel with the tribe portions, it shall
belong to the prince; and the holy heave and the sanctuary of the house
shall be in the midst. [Eze 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#022.md).
Thus from the possession of the Levites (as) from the possession of the
city shall that which lies in the midst of what belongs to the prince
between the territory of Judah and the territory of Benjamin belong to
the prince. [Eze 48:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#023.md). And the rest
of the tribes are from the east side to the west side: Benjamin one.
[Eze 48:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#024.md). And on the boundary of
Benjamin from the east side to the west side: Simeon one. [Eze
48:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#025.md). And on the boundary of Simeon
from the east side to the west side: Issachar one. [Eze
48:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#026.md). And on the boundary of Issachar
from the east side to the west side: Zebulon one. [Eze
48:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#027.md). And on the boundary of Zebulon
from the east side to the west side: Gad one. [Eze
48:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#028.md). And on the boundary of Gad on
the south side toward the south, the boundary shall be from Tamar to the
water of strife from Kadesh along the brook to the great sea. [Eze
48:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#029.md). This is the land which ye shall
divide by lot for inheritance to the tribes of Israel; these are their
portions, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.

The new division of the land differs from the former one effected in the
time of Joshua, in the first place, in the fact that all the
tribe-portions were to extend uniformly across the entire breadth of the
land from the eastern boundary to the Mediterranean Sea on the west, so
that they were to form parallel tracts of country; whereas in the
distribution made in the time of Joshua, several of the
tribe-territories covered only half the breadth of the land. For
example, Dan received his inheritance on the west of Benjamin; and the
territories of half Manasseh and Asher ran up from the northern boundary
of Ephraim to the northern boundary of Canaan; while Issachar, Naphtali,
and Zebulon received their portions on the east of these; and lastly,
Simeon received his possession within the boundaries of the tribe of
Judah. And secondly, it also differs from the former, in the fact that
not only are all the twelve tribes located in Canaan proper, between the
Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea; whereas previously two tribes and a
half had received from Moses, at their own request, the conquered land
of Bashan and Gilead on the eastern side of the Jordan, so that the land
of Canaan could be divided among the remaining nine tribes and a half.
But besides this, the central tract of land, about the fifth part of the
whole, was separated for the holy heave, the city domain, and the
prince's land, so that only the northern and southern portions, about
four-fifths of the whole, remained for distribution among the twelve
tribes, seven tribes receiving their hereditary portions to the north of
the heave and five to the south, because the heave was so selected that
the city with its territory lay near the ancient Jerusalem. - In [Eze
48:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md) the seven tribes which were to
dwell on the north of the heave are enumerated. The principal points of
the northern boundary, viz., the way to Chetlon and Hazar-Enon, the
boundary of Damascus, are repeated in [Eze
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md) from [Eze
47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md), [Eze
47:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#017.md), as the starting and terminal
points of the northern boundary running from west to east. The words
אל־יד חמת fix the northern boundary more precisely in relation to the
adjoining territory; and in 'והיוּ the enumeration of the tribe-lots
begins with that of the tribe of Dan, which was to receive its territory
against the northern boundary. לו refers to the name דּן which follows,
and which Ezekiel already had in his mind. פּאת קדים היּם is constructed
asyndetôs; and פּאת is to be repeated in thought before היּם: the east
side (and) the west (side) are to belong to it, i.e., the tract of land
toward its west and its east side. The words which follow, דּן אחד, are
attached in an anacoluthistic manner: "Dan (is to receive) one portion,"
for "one shall belong to Dan." To אחד we are to supply in thought the
substantive חבל, tribe-lot, according to [Eze
47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md). "The assumption that one tribe
was to receive as much as another (vid., [Eze
47:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#014).md), leads to the conclusion that
each tribe-lot was to be taken as a monas" (Kliefoth). In this way the
names in [Eze 48:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#002.md), with the
constantly repeated אחד, must also be taken. The same form of
description is repeated in [Eze
48:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#023.md) in the case of the five
tribes placed to the south of the heave. - In the order of the several
tribe-territories it is impossible to discover any universal principle
of arrangement. All that is clear is, that in the case of Dan, Asher,
Naphtali, Manasseh, and Ephraim, regard is had to the former position of
these tribe-territories as far as the altered circumstances allowed. In
the time of the Judges a portion of the Danites had migrated to the
north, conquered the city of Laish, and given it the name of Dan, so
that from that time forward Dan is generally named as the northern
boundary of the land (e.g., as early as [Sa2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#010), and in other passages.md).
Accordingly Dan receives the tract of land along the northern boundary.
Asher and Naphtali, which formerly occupied the most northerly portions
of the land, follow next. Then comes Manasseh, as half Manasseh had
formerly dwelt on the east of Naphtali; and Ephraim joins Manasseh, as
it formerly joined the western half of Manasseh. The reason for placing
Reuben between Ephraim and Judah appears to be, that Reuben was the
first-born of Jacob's sons. The position of the termuah between Judah
and Benjamin is probably connected with the circumstance that Jerusalem
formerly stood on the boundary of these two tribes, and so also in the
future was to skirt Benjamin with its territory. The other tribes had
then to be located on the south of Benjamin; Simeon, whose territory
formerly lay to the south; Issachar and Zebulon, for which no room was
left in the north; and Gad, which had to be brought over from Gilead to
Canaan.

In [Eze 48:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008.md), the terumah, which
has already been described in [Eze
45:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md) for a different purpose, is
more precisely defined: first of all, in [Eze
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008.md), according to its whole extent -
viz. twenty-five thousand rods in breadth (from north to south), and the
length the same as any one (= every one) of the tribe-lots, i.e.,
reaching from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea (cf. [Eze
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007).md). In the centre of this separated
territory the sanctuary (the temple) was to stand. בּתוכו, the suffix of
which refers ad sensum to חלק instead of תּרוּמה, has not the indefinite
meaning "therein," but signifies "in the centre;" for the priests'
portion, in the middle of which the temple was to stand, occupied the
central position between the portion of the Levites and the city
possession, as is evident from [Eze
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#022.md). The circumstance that here, as
in [Eze 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md)., in the division of the
terumah, the priests' portion is mentioned first, then the portion of
the Levites, and after this the city possession, proves nothing so far
as the local order in which these three portions followed one another is
concerned; but the enumeration is regulated by their spiritual
significance, so that first of all the most holy land for the temple and
priests is defined, then the holy portion of the Levites, and lastly,
the common land for the city. The command, that the sanctuary is to
occupy the centre of the whole terumah, leads to a more minute
description in the first place ([Eze
48:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#009).md) of the priests' portion, in
which the sanctuary was situated, than of the heave to be lifted off for
Jehovah. In [Eze 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#010.md), לאלּה, which
stands at the head, is explained by לכּהנים which follows. The extent of
this holy terumah on all four sides is then given; and lastly, the
command is repeated, that the sanctuary of Jehovah is to be in the
centre of it. In [Eze 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#011.md), המקדּשׁ
is rendered in the plural by the lxx, Chald. and Syr., and is taken in a
distributive sense by Kimchi and others: to the priests whoever is
sanctified of the sons of Zadok. This is required by the position of the
participle between לכּהנים and מבּני צדוק (compare [Ch2
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#018.md), and for the singular of the
participle after a previous plural, [Psa
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#009).md). The other rendering, "for the
priests is it sanctified, those of the sons of Zadok," is at variance
not only with the position of the words, but also with the fact, namely,
that the assignment to the priests of a heave set apart for Jehovah is
never designated as קדּשׁ, and from the nature of the case could not be
so designated. The apodosis to [Eze
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#011.md) follows in [Eze
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#012.md), where לכּהנים is resumed in
להם. תּרוּמיּה is an adjective formation derived from תּרוּמה, with the
signification of an abstract: that which is lifted (the lifting) from
the heave, as it were "a terumah in the second potency" (for these
formations, see Ewald, 164 and 165). This terumiyah is called most holy,
in contrast with the Levites' portion of the terumah, which was קדשׁ
([Eze 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#014).md). The priests' portion is
to be beside the territory of the Levites, whether on the southern or
northern side cannot be gathered from these words any more than from the
definition in [Eze 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#013.md) : "and the
Levites beside (parallel with) the territory of the priests." Both
statements simply affirm that the portions of the priests and Levites
were to lie side by side, and not to be separated by the town
possession. - [Eze 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#013.md) and [Eze
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#014.md) treat of the Levites' portion:
[Eze 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#013.md), of its situation and
extent; [Eze 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#014.md), of its law of
tenure. The seemingly tautological repetition of the measurement of the
length and breadth, as "all the length and the breadth," is occasioned
by the fact "that Ezekiel intends to express himself more briefly here,
and not, as in [Eze 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#010.md), to take all
the four points of the compass singly; in 'all the length' he embraces
the two long sides of the oblong, and in '(all) the breadth' the two
broad sides, and affirms that 'all the length,' i.e., of both the north
and south sides, is to be twenty-five thousand rods, and 'all the
breadth,' i.e., of both the east and west sides, is to be ten thousand
rods" (Kliefoth). Hitzig has missed the sense, and therefore proposes to
alter the text. With regard to the possession of the Levites, the
instructions given in [Lev 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#034.md) for
the field of the Levites' cities - namely, that none of it was to be
sold - are extended to the whole of the territory of the Levites: no
part of it is to be alienated by sale or barter. And the character of
the possession is assigned as the reason: the first-fruit of the land,
i.e., the land lifted off (separated) as first-fruit, is not to pass
into the possession of others, because as such it is holy to the Lord.
The Chetib ya\`abowr יעבור is the correct reading: to pass over, sc. to
others, to non-Levites.

[Eze 48:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015.md) treat of the city
possession. As the terumah was twenty-five thousand rods in breadth
([Eze 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008).md), after measuring off ten
thousand rods in breadth for the priests and ten thousand rods in
breadth for the Levites from the entire breadth, there still remain five
thousand rods על, in front of, i.e., along, the long side, which was
twenty-five thousand rods. This remnant was to be חל, i.e., common (not
holy) land for the city (Jerusalem). למושׁב, for dwelling-places, i.e.,
for building dwelling-houses upon; and למגרשׁ, for open space, the
precinct around the city. The city was to stand in the centre of this
oblong. [Eze 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016.md) gives the size of
the city: on each of the four sides, four thousand five hundred rods
(the חמשׁ, designated by the Masoretes as כתיב ולא קרי, has crept into
the text through a copyist's error); and [Eze
48:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#017.md), the extent of the open space
surrounding it: on each side two hundred and fifty rods. This gives for
the city, together with the open space, a square of five thousand rods
on every side; so that the city with its precinct filled the entire
breadth of the space left for it, and there only remained on the east
and west an open space of ten thousand rods in length and five thousand
rods in breadth along the holy terumah. This is noticed in [Eze
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#018.md); its produce was to serve for
bread, i.e., for maintenance, for the labourers of the city (the
masculine suffix in תּבוּאתה refers grammatically to הנּותר). By עבדי
העיר Hitzig would understand the inhabitants of the city, because one
cultivates a piece of land even by dwelling on it. But this use of עבד
cannot be established. Nor are עבדי העיר the workmen employed in
building the city, as Gesenius, Hvernick, and others suppose; for the
city was not perpetually being built, so that there should be any
necessity for setting apart a particular piece of land for the builders;
but they are the working men of the city, the labouring class living in
the city. They are not to be without possession in the future Jerusalem,
but are to receive a possession in land for their maintenance. We are
told in [Eze 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#019.md) who these workmen
are. Here העבד is used collectively: as for the labouring class of the
city, people out of all the tribes of Israel shall work upon the land
belonging to the city. The suffix in יעבדוּהוּ points back to הנּותר.
The transitive explanation, to employ a person in work, has nothing in
the language to confirm it. The fact itself is in harmony with the
statement in [Eze 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006.md), that the city
was to belong to all Israel. Lastly, in [Eze
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#020.md) the dimensions of the whole
terumah, and the relation of the city possession to the holy terumah,
are given. כּל־התּרוּמה is the whole heave, so far as it has hitherto
been described, embracing the property of the priests, of the Levites,
and of the city. In this extent it is twenty-five thousand rods long and
the same broad. If, however, we add the property of the prince, which is
not treated of till [Eze 48:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#021.md), it
is considerably longer, and reaches, as has been stated in [Eze
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008.md), to the boundaries of the land
both on the east and west, the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, as the
several tribe-territories do. But if we omit the prince's land, the
space set apart fro the city possession occupied the fourth part of the
holy terumah, i.e., of the portion of the priests and Levites. This is
the meaning of the second half of [Eze
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#020.md), which literally reads thus: "to
a fourth shall ye lift off the holy terumah for the city possession."
This is not to be understood as meaning that a fourth was to be taken
from the holy terumah for the city possession; for that would yield an
incorrect proportion, as the twenty thousand rods in breadth would be
reduced to fifteen thousand rods by the subtraction of the fourth part,
which would be opposed to [Eze 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#009.md)
and [Eze 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015.md). The meaning is rather
the following: from the whole terumah the fourth part of the area of the
holy terumah is to be taken off for the city possession, i.e., five
thousand rods for twenty thousand. According to [Eze
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015.md), this was the size of the domain
set apart for the city.

In [Eze 48:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#021.md) the situation and
extent of the prince's possession are described. For [Eze
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#021.md), vid., [Eze
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007.md). הנּותר, the rest of the terumah,
as it has been defined in [Eze 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008.md),
reaching in length from the Jordan to the Mediterranean. As the holy
terumah and the city possession were only twenty-five thousand rods in
length, and did not reach to the Jordan on the east, or to the sea on
the west, there still remained an area on either side whose length or
extent toward the east and west is not given in rods, but may be
calculated from the proportion which the intervening terumah bore to the
length of the land (from east to west). אל־פּני and על־פּני, in front
of, or along, the front of the twenty-five thousand rods, refer to the
eastern and western boundaries of the terumah, which was twenty-five
thousand rods in length. In [Eze 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#021.md)
the statement is repeated, that the holy terumah and the sanctuary were
to lie in the centre of it, i.e., between the portions of land appointed
for the prince on either side; and lastly, in [Eze
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#022.md) it is still further stated, with
regard to the prince's land on both sides of the terumah, that it was to
lie between the adjoining tribe-territories of Judah (to the north) and
Benjamin (to the south), so that it was to be bounded by these two. But
this is expressed in a heavy and therefore obscure manner. The words
בּתוך אשׁר לנשׂיא יהיה, "in the centre of that which belongs to the
prince," belong to העיר... וּמאחזּת, and form together with the latter
the subject, which is written absolutely; so that מן is not used in a
partitive, but in a local sense (from), and the whole is to be rendered
thus: And as for that which lies on the side of the possession of the
Levites, and of the possession of the city in the centre of what belongs
to the prince, (that which lies) between the territory of Judah and the
territory of Benjamin shall belong to the prince. Hitzig's explanation -
what remains between Judah and Benjamin, from the city territory to the
priests' domain, both inclusive, shall belong to the prince - is
arbitrary, and perverts the sense. The periphrastic designation of the
terumah bounded off between the prince's land by the two portions named
together without a copula, viz., "possession of the Levites and
possession of the city," is worthy of notice. This periphrasis of the
whole by two portions, shows that the portions named formed the
boundaries of the whole, that the third portion, which is not mentioned,
was enclosed within the two, so that the priests' portion with the
sanctuary lay between them. - In [Eze
48:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#023.md) the rest of the tribes
located to the south of the terumah are mentioned in order; and in [Eze
48:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#028.md) and [Eze
48:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#029.md) the account of the division of
the land is brought to a close with a repetition of the statement as to
the southern boundary (cf. [Eze
47:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019).md), and a comprehensive concluding
formula.

If now we attempt, in order to form a clear idea of the relation in
which this prophetic division of the land stands to the actual size of
Canaan according to the boundaries described in [Eze
47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md)., to determine the length and
breadth of the terumah given here by their geographical dimensions,
twenty-five thousand rods, according to the metrological calculations of
Boeckh and Bertheau, would be 1070 geographical miles, or, according to
the estimate of the Hebrew cubit by Thenius, only 975 geographical
miles.

(Note: According to Boeckh, one sacred cubit was equal to 234-1/3 Paris
lines = 528.62 millimtres; according to Thenius = 214-1/2 P. l. = 481.62
millim. Now as one geographical mile, the 5400th part of the
circumference of the globe, which is 40,000,000 metres, is equivalent to
7407.398 metres = 22, 803.290 old Paris feet, the geographical mile
according to Boeckh is 14, 012-1/10 cubits = 2335-1/2 rods (sacred
measure); according to Thenius, 15, 380-1/6 cubits = 2563-1/3 roads (s.
m.), from which the numbers given in the text may easily be calculated.)

The extent of Canaan from Beersheba, or Kadesh, up to a line running
across from Rs esh-Shukah to the spring El Lebweh, is 3 1/3 degrees,
i.e., fifty geographical miles, ten of which are occupied by the
terumah, and forty remain for the twelve tribe-territories, so that each
tribe-lot would be 3 1/3 geographical miles in breadth. If, now, we
reckon three geographical miles as the breadth of each of the five
tribe-lots to the south of the terumah, and as the land becomes broader
toward the south a breadth of 3-4/7 geographical miles for the seven
tribe-lots to the north, the terumah set apart in the centre of the land
would extend from the site of Jerusalem to Dothan or Jenin. If, however,
we take into consideration the breadth of the land from east to west in
the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, or where the Jordan enters the Dead Sea,
Canaan is eleven geographical miles in breadth, whereas at Jenin it is
hardly ten geographical miles broad. If, therefore, the length of the
terumah (from east to west) was fully ten geographical miles, there
would only remain a piece of land of half a mile in breadth on the east
and west at the southern boundary, and nothing at all at the northern,
for prince's land. We have therefore given to the terumah upon the map
(Plate IV) the length and breadth of eight geographical miles, which
leaves a tract of two miles on the average for the prince's land, so
that it would occupy a fifth of the area of the holy terumah, whereas
the city possession covered a fourth. No doubt the breadth of the
terumah from south to north is also diminished thereby, so that it
cannot have reached quite down to Jerusalem or quite up to Jenin. - If,
now, we consider that the distances of places, and therefore also the
measurements of a land in length and breadth, are greater in reality
than those given upon the map, on account partly of the mountains and
valleys and partly of the windings of the roads, and, still further,
that our calculations of the Hebrew cubit are not quite certain, and
that even the smaller estimates of Thenius are possibly still too high,
the measurements of the terumah given by Ezekiel correspond as exactly
to the actual size of the land of Canaan as could be expected with a
knowledge of its extent obtained not by trigonometrical measurement, but
from a simple calculation of the length of the roads. - But this
furnishes a confirmation by no means slight of our assumption, that the
lengths and breadths indicated here are measured by rods and not by
cubits. Reckoned by cubits, the terumah would be only a mile and a half
or a mile and two-thirds in length and breadth, and the city possession
would be only a third of a mile broad; whereas the prince's land would
be more than six times as large as the whole of the terumah, - i.e., of
the territory of the Levites, the priests, and the city, - thirteen
times as large as the priests' land, and from thirty to thirty-two times
as large as the city possession = proportions the improbability of which
is at once apparent.

Size, Gates, and Name of the City

To complete the whole picture of the future land of Israel, what has
been stated in [Eze 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015.md) and [Eze
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016.md) concerning the size of the holy
city is still further expanded here. - [Eze
48:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#030.md). And these are the outgoings of
the city from the north side, four thousand and five hundred (rods)
measurement. [Eze 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#031.md). And the gates
of the city according to the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates
toward the north; the gate of Reuben one, the gate of Judah one, the
gate of Levi one. [Eze 48:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#032.md). And on
the east side four thousand five hundred (rods): and three gates;
namely, the gate of Joseph one, the gate of Benjamin one, the gate of
Dan one. [Eze 48:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#033.md). And to the south
side, four thousand five hundred measurement: and three gates; the gate
of Simeon one, the gate of Issachar one, the gate of Zebulon one. [Eze
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#034.md). To the west side, four thousand
five hundred - their gates three; the gate of Gad one, the gate of Asher
one, the gate of Naphtali one. [Eze
48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035.md). Round about, eighteen thousand
(rods); and the name of the city: from henceforth Jehovah there. - The
situation of the city of God within the terumah and its external
dimensions have already been generally indicated in [Eze
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015.md), [Eze
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016.md). Here the measurement of the
several sides is specified with a notice of their gates, and this is
preceded by the heading, "the outlets of the city." תּוצאת, the
outgoings (not extensions, for the word never has this meaning) as the
furthest extremities in which a city or a tract of land terminates; not
outlets or gates, which are expressly distinguished from them, but
outgoing sides; hence the definition of the extent or length of the
several sides is appended immediately afterwards. The enumeration
commences, as above in the case of the land, with the north side. Each
side has three gates, so that the whole city has twelve, which bear the
names of the twelve tribes, like the gates of the heavenly Jerusalem in
[Rev 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012.md), because it will be the
city of the true people of God. Levi is included here, and consequently
Ephraim and Manasseh are united in the one tribe of Joseph. The three
sons of Leah commence the series with the northern gates. They also
stand first in the blessing of Moses in [Deu
33:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006.md) : the first-born in age, the
first-born by virtue of the patriarchal blessing, and the one chosen by
Jehovah for His own service in the place of the first-born. Then follow,
for the eastern gates, the two sons of Rachel, according to their age
(thus deviating from [Deu 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012.md) and
[Deu 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#013).md), and, along with them, the
elder son of Rachel's maid; for the southern gates, the three other sons
of Leah; and lastly, for the western gates, the three other sons of the
maids. Being thus indicated by the names of its gates as the city of all
Israel, the city itself receives a name, which exalts it into the city
of God (Jehovah). But different explanations have been given of the
words in [Eze 48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035.md) which refer to
this name. The allusion in מיום and the meaning of שׁמּה are both
disputed points. It is true that the latter literally means "thither;"
but Ezekiel also uses it as synonymous with שׁם, "there," in [Eze
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003.md) and [Eze
32:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#029.md), so that the assertion that
שׁמּה never means "there" is incorrect. מיום, from day forward,
equivalent to henceforward; but not henceforth and for ever, though this
may be implied in the context. Whether מיום be taken in connection with
the preceding words, "the name of the city will henceforward be," or
with those which follow, the name of the city will be, "henceforward
Jehovah there," makes no material difference so far as the thought is
concerned, as the city can only bear the name from the time when Jehovah
is שׁמּה, and can only bear it so long as Jehovah is שׁמּה. But so far
as the question is concerned, whether שׁמּה signifies thither or there
in this passage, Hvernick is of opinion, indeed, that the whole of
Ezekiel's vision does not harmonize with the meaning "there," inasmuch
as he separates temple and city, so that Jehovah does not properly dwell
in Jerusalem, but, in the strictest an highest sense, in His sanctuary,
and turns thence to Jerusalem with the fulness of His grace and love.
But if Jehovah does not merely direct His love toward the city from afar
off, but, as Hvernick still further says, turns it fully toward it,
causes His good pleasure to rest upon it, then He also rules and is in
the city with His love, so that it can bear the name "Jehovah thither
(there)." In any case, the interpretation, "Jehovah will from henceforth
proceed thither, to restore it, to make it a holy city" (Kliefoth), is
untenable; for the name is not given to Jerusalem when lying waste, but
to the city already restored and fully built, which Ezekiel sees in the
spirit. He has therefore before this turned His favour once more to
Jerusalem, which was laid waste; and the name יהוה שׁמּה, given to the
new Jerusalem, can only affirm that henceforward it is to be a city of
Jehovah, i.e., that from this time forth Jehovah will be and rule in
her. The rendering "Jehovah thither" does not answer to this, but only
the rendering, "Jehovah will be there." compare [Isa
60:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#014.md), where Jerusalem is called the
city of Jehovah, Zion of the Holy One in Israel, because the glory of
Jehovah has risen over her as a brilliant light.
