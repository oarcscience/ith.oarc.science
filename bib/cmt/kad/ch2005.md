### [2 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 5:1</span></span>

[Ch2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md) contains the conclusion of
the account of the preparation of the sacred utensils as in [Kg1
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051.md), and with it also the whole
account of the building of the temple is brought to an end. The ו before
את־הכּסף and את־הזּהב corresponds to the Lat. et - et, both - and also.
As to David's offerings, cf. [Ch1
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#010.md) and [Ch1
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#011.md); and on the whole matter,
compare also the remarks on [Kg1 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051.md).

[2 Chronicles 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 5:2</span></span>

The first part of the celebration was the transfer of the ark from Mount
Zion to the temple ([Ch2 5:2-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#002).md), and
in connection with this we have the words in which Solomon celebrates
the entry of the Lord into the new temple ([Ch2
6:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001).md). This section has been already
commented on in the remarks on 1 Kings 8:1-21, and we have here,
consequently, only to set down briefly those discrepancies between our
account and that other, which have any influence upon the meaning. - In
[Ch2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#003.md) the name of the month, האתנים
בּירח ([Kg1 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002).md), with which the
supplementary clause, "that is the seventh month," is there connected,
is omitted, so that we must either change החדשׁ into בּחרשׁ, or supply
the name of the month; for the festival is not the seventh month, but
was held in that month.

[2 Chronicles 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 5:4</span></span>

Instead of הלויּם, we have in 2 Kings הכּהנים, the priests bare the ark;
and since even according to the Chronicle ([Ch2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#007).md) the priests bare the ark into the
holy place, we must understand by הלויּם such Levites were also priests.
- In [Ch2 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#005.md), too the words הלויּם
הכּהנים are inexact, and are to be corrected by [Kg1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#004.md), והלויּם הכּהנים. For even if the
Levitic priests bare the ark and the sacred utensils of the tabernacle
into the temple, yet the tabernacle itself (the planks, hangings, and
coverings of it) was borne into the temple, to be preserved as a holy
relic, not by priests, but only by Levites. The conj. ו before הלוים has
probably been omitted only by a copyist, who was thinking of הלוים
הכהנים ([Jos 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#003.md); [Deu
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009.md), [Deu
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#018), etc..md). - In [Ch2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#008.md) ויכסּוּ is an orthographical error
for ויּסכּוּ, [Kg1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#007.md); cf. [Ch1
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018.md); [Exo
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020.md). - In [Ch2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#009.md), too, מן־הארון has probably come
into our text only by a copyist's mistake instead of מן־הקּדשׁ ([Kg1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008).md).

[2 Chronicles 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 5:10</span></span>

נתן אשׁר, who had given, i.e., laid in, is not so exact as שׁם הנּיח
אשׁר ([Kg1 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009).md), but may be justified
by a reference to [Exo 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#020.md).

[2 Chronicles 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 5:11</span></span>

[Ch2 5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md) describe the part which
the priests and Levitical singers and musicians took in the solemn act
of transferring the ark to the temple-a matter entirely passed over in
the narrative in [Kg1 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011.md), which
confines itself to the main transaction. The mention of the priests
gives occasion for the remark, [Ch2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md), "for all the priests present had
sanctified themselves, but the courses were not to be observed," i.e.,
the courses of the priests (1 Chron 24) could not be observed. The
festival was so great, that not merely the course appointed to perform
the service of that week, but also all the courses had sanctified
themselves and co-operated in the celebration. In reference to the
construction לשׁמור אין, cf. Ew. 321, b.

[Ch2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012.md)

All the Levitic singers and musicians were also engaged in it, to make
the festival glorious by song and instrumental music: "and the Levites,
the singers, all of them, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, and their sons and
brethren, clad in byssus, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, stood
eastward from the altar, and with them priests to 120, blowing
trumpets." The ל before כּלּם and the following noun is the introductory
ל: "as regards." On the form מחצררים, see on [Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024.md); on these singers and musicians,
their clothing, and their instruments, see on [Ch1
15:17-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017.md) and [Ch2
25:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001.md).

[Ch2 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013.md)

[Ch2 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013.md) runs thus literally: "And it
came to pass, as one, regarding the trumpeters and the singers, that
they sang with one voice to praise and thank Jahve." The meaning is: and
the trumpeters and singers, together as one man, sang with one voice to
praise. כּאחד is placed first for emphasis; stress is laid upon the
subject, the trumpeters and singers, by the introductory ל; and היה is
construed with the following infinitive (להשׁמיע): it was to sound, to
cause to hear, for they were causing to hear, where ל c. infin. is
connected with היה, as the participle is elsewhere, to describe the
circumstances; cf. Ew. 237. But in order to express very strongly the
idea of the unisono of the trumpet-sound, and the singing accompanied by
the harp-playing, which lies in כּאחד, אחד קול is added to להשׁמיע. By
וגו קול וּכהרים all that was to be said of the song and music is drawn
together in the form of a protasis, to which is joined מלא והבּית, the
apodosis both of this latter and also of the protasis which was
interrupted by the parenthesis in [Ch2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md) : "When the priests went forth
from the holy place, for...([Ch2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011).md), and when they lifted up the
voice with trumpets and with cymbals, and the (other) instruments of
song, and with the praise of Jahve, that He is good, that His mercy
endureth for ever (cf. [Ch1 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034).md),
then was the house filled with the cloud of the house of Jahve." The
absence of the article before ענן requires us thus to connect the יהוה
בּית at the close of the verse with ענן (stat. constr.), since the
indefinite ענן (without the article) is not at all suitable here; for it
is not any cloud which is here spoken of, but that which overshadowed
the glory of the Lord in the most holy place.

[2 Chronicles 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 5:14</span></span>

[Ch2 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014.md), again, agrees with [Kg1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#006.md), and has been there commented
upon.
