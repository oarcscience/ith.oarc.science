### [Zephaniah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md)

[Zephaniah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zep 3:1</span></span>

To give still greater emphasis to his exhortation to repentance, the
prophet turns to Jerusalem again, that he may once more hold up before
the hardened sinners the abominations of this city, in which Jehovah
daily proclaims His right, and shows the necessity for the judgment, as
the only way that is left by which to secure salvation for Israel and
for the whole world. [Zep 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md). "Woe to
the refractory and polluted one, the oppressive city! [Zep
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#002.md). She has not hearkened to the
voice; not accepted discipline; not trusted in Jehovah; not drawn near
to her God. [Zep 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md). Her princes are
roaring lions in the midst of her; her judges evening wolves, who spare
not for the morning. [Zep 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md). Her
prophets boasters, men of treacheries: her priests desecrate that which
is holy, to violence to the law." The woe applies to the city of
Jerusalem. That this is intended in [Zep
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md) is indisputably evident from the
explanation which follows in [Zep
3:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#002.md) of the predicates applied to the
city addressed in [Zep 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md). By the
position of the indeterminate predicates מוראה and נגאלה before the
subject to which the hōi refers, the threat acquires greater emphasis.
מוראה is not formed from the hophal of ראה (ἐπιφανής, lxx, Cyr., Cocc.),
but is the participle kal of מרא = מרה or מרר, to straighten one's self,
and hold one's self against a person, hence to be rebellious (see
Delitzsch on Job, on [Job 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#002), note.md).
נגאלה, stained with sins and abominations (cf. [Isa
59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003).md). Yōnâh does not mean columba,
but oppressive (as in [Jer 46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016.md); [Jer
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#016.md), and [Jer
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038)).md), as a participle of yânâh to
oppress (cf. [Jer 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003).md). These
predicates are explained and vindicated in [Zep
3:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#002.md), viz., first of all מוראה in
[Zep 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#002.md). She gives no heed to the
voice, sc. of God in the law and in the words of the prophets (compare
[Jer 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028.md), where קול יהוה occurs in
the repetition of the first hemistich). The same thing is affirmed in
the second clause, "she accepts no chastisement." These two clauses
describe the attitude assumed towards the legal contents of the word of
God, the next two the attitude assumed towards its evangelical contents,
i.e., the divine promises. Jerusalem has no faith in these, and does not
allow them to draw her to her God. The whole city is the same, i.e., the
whole of the population of the city. Her civil and spiritual rulers are
no better. Their conduct shows that the city is oppressive and polluted
([Zep 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md) and [Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004).md). Compare with this the
description of the leaders in [Mic
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md). The princes are lions, which
rush with roaring upon the poor and lowly, to tear them in pieces and
destroy them ([Pro 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015.md); [Eze
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#002.md); [Nah
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#012).md). The judges resemble evening
wolves (see at [Hab 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008).md), as
insatiable as wolves, which leave not a single bone till the following
morning, of the prey they have caught in the evening. The verb gâram is
a denom. from gerem, to gnaw a bone, piel to crush them ([Num
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008).md); to gnaw a bone for the morning,
is the same as to leave it to be gnawed in the morning. Gâram has not in
itself the meaning to reserve or lay up (Ges. Lex.). The prophets, i.e.,
those who carry on their prophesying without a call from God (see [Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md); [Mic
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005.md), [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011).md), are pōchăzı̄m, vainglorious,
boasting, from pâchaz, to boil up or boil over, and when applied to
speaking, to overflow with frivolous words. Men of treacheries,
bōgedōth, a subst. verb, from bâgad, the classical word for faithless
adultery or apostasy from God. The prophets proved themselves to be so
by speaking the thoughts of their own hearts to the people as
revelations from God, and thereby strengthening it in its apostasy from
the Lord. The priests profane that which is holy (qoodesh, every holy
thing or act), and do violence to the law, namely, by treating what is
holy as profane, and perverting the precepts of the law concerning holy
and unholy (cf. [Eze 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026).md).

[Zephaniah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zep 3:5</span></span>

Jerusalem sins in this manner, without observing that Jehovah is
constantly making known to it His own righteousness. [Zep
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005.md). "Jehovah is just in the midst of
her; does no wrong: morning by morning He sets His justice in the light,
not failing; but the unjust knoweth no shame. [Zep
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006.md). I have cut off nations: their
battlements are laid waste; I have devastated their streets, so that no
one else passeth over: their cities are laid waste, that there is no man
there, not an inhabitant more." [Zep
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005.md) is attached adversatively to what
precedes without a particle, in this sense: And yet Jehovah is just
beqirbâh, i.e., in the midst of the city filled with sinners. The words
recal to mind the description of the divine administration in [Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md), where Jehovah is described as
אין עול and ישׁר. It follows from this that tsaddı̄q is not to be
referred to the fact that God does not leave the sins of the nation
unpunished (Ros.), but to the fact that He commits no wrong: so that לא
יעשׂה עולה is only a negative paraphrase of tsaddı̄q. His justice, i.e.,
the righteousness of His conduct, He puts in the light every morning
(babbōqer babbōqer, used distributively, as in [Exo
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#021.md); [Lev
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#005), etc..md), not by rewarding virtue
and punishing wickedness (Hitzig, Strauss, after the Chaldee, Jerome,
Theodoret, and Cyril), according to which mishpât would signify
judgment; but by causing His law and justice to be proclaimed to the
nation daily "by prophets, whose labour He employs to teach the nation
His laws, and who exert themselves diligently by exhorting and
admonishing every day, to call it to bring forth better fruit, but all
in vain (Ros., Ewald, etc.; cf. [Hos
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#005).md). It is at variance with the
context to take these words as referring to the judgments of God. These
are first spoken of in [Zep 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006.md), and
the correspondence between these two verses and [Zep
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#007.md) and [Zep
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md) shows that we must not mix up
together [Zep 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005.md) and [Zep
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006.md), or interpret [Zep
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005.md) from [Zep
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006.md). Just as the judgment is
threatened there ([Zep 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008).md) because
the people have accepted no correction, and have not allowed themselves
to be moved to the fear of Jehovah, so also in [Zep
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005.md) and [Zep
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006.md) the prophet demonstrates the
righteousness of God from His double administration: viz., first, from
the fact that He causes His justice to be proclaimed to the people, that
they may accept correction; and secondly, by pointing to the judgments
upon the nations. לא נעדּר paraphrases the idea of "infallibly;" the
literal meaning is, that there is no morning in which the justice is
wanting. Hitzig, Strauss, and others have rendered it quite unsuitably,
"God does not suffer Himself to be wanting," i.e., does not remain
absent. But the perverse one, viz., the nation sunk in unrighteousness,
knows no disgrace, to make it ashamed of its misdeeds. In [Zep
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006.md) Jehovah is introduced as speaking,
to set before the nations in the most impressive manner the judgments in
which He has manifested His righteousness. The two hemistichs are formed
uniformly, each consisting of two clauses, in which the direct address
alternates with an indefinite, passive construction: I have cut off
nations, their battlements have been laid waste, etc. Gōyı̄m are neither
those nations who are threatened with ruin in [Zep
2:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004.md), nor the Canaanites, who have
been exterminated by Israel, but nations generally, which have succumbed
to the judgments of God, without any more precise definition. Pinnōth,
the battlements of the fortress-walls and towers ([Zep
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#016).md), stand per synecdochen for
castles or fortifications. Chūtsōth are not streets of the city, but
roads, and stand synecdochically for the flat country. This is required
by the correspondence of the clauses. For just as the cities answer to
the castles, so do chūtsōth to the nations. Nitsdū, from tsâdâh, not in
the sense of waylaying ([Exo 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013.md);
[Sa1 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#012).md), but in accordance with
Aramaean usage, to lay waste, answering to nâshammū, for which Jeremiah
uses nittetsū in [Jer 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#026.md).

[Zephaniah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zep 3:7</span></span>

In [Zep 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#007.md) and [Zep
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md) the prophet sums up all that he
has said in [Zep 3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md), to close his
admonition to repentance with the announcement of judgment. [Zep
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#007.md). "I said, Only do thou fear me, do
thou accept correction, so will their dwelling not be cut off, according
to all that I have appointed concerning them: but they most zealously
destroyed all their doings. [Zep 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md).
Therefore wait for me, is the saying of Jehovah, for the day when I rise
up to the prey; for it is my right to gather nations together, to bring
kingdoms in crowds, to heap upon them my fury, all the burning of my
wrath: for in the fire of my zeal will the whole earth be devoured." God
has not allowed instruction and warning to be wanting, to avert the
judgment of destruction from Judah; but the people have been getting
worse and worse, so that now He is obliged to make His justice
acknowledged on earth by means of judgments. אמרתּי, not I thought, but
I said. This refers to the strenuous exertions of God to bring His
justice to the light day by day ([Zep
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005).md), and to admonitions of the
prophets in order to bring the people to repentance. תּיראי and תּקחי
dna תּ are cohortatives, chosen instead of imperatives, to set forth the
demand of God by clothing it in the form of entreating admonition as an
emanation of His love. Lâqach mūsâr as in [Zep
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#002.md). The words are addressed to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem personified as the daughter of Zion ([Zep
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011).md); and מעונהּ, her dwelling, is
the city of Jerusalem, not the temple, which is called the
dwelling-place of Jehovah indeed, but never the dwelling-place of the
nation, or of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The clause which follows,
and which has been very differently interpreted, כּל אשׁר פּקדתּי עליה,
can hardly be taken in any other way than that in which Ewald has taken
it, viz., by rendering kōl as the accusative of manner: according to all
that I have appointed, or as I have appointed everything concerning
them. For it is evidently impracticable to connect it with what precedes
as asyndeton, because the idea of יבוא cannot be taken per zeugma from
יכּרת, and we should necessarily have to supply that idea. For hikkârēth
does not in any way fit in with אשׁר פּקדתּי, whether we take פּקד על in
the sense of charge, command, appoint (after [Job
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013.md); [Job
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#023).md), or in that of correct, punish.
For the thought that God will cut off all that He has appointed
concerning Jerusalem, would be just as untenable as the thought that He
will exterminate the sins that have been punished in Jerusalem. But
instead of repenting, the people have only shown themselves still more
zealous in evil deeds. Hishkı̄m, to rise early, then in connection with
another verb, adverbially: early and zealously. Hishchı̄th, to act
corruptly; and with ‛ălı̄lōth, to complete corrupt and evil deeds (cf.
[Psa 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001).md). Jehovah must therefore
interpose with punishment.

[Zep 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md)

With the summons chakkū lı̄, wait for me, the prophecy returns to its
starting-point in [Zep 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#002.md) and [Zep
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md), to bring it to a close. The
persons addressed are kol ‛anvē hâ'ârets, whom the prophet has summoned
in the introduction to his exhortation to repentance ([Zep
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003).md), to seek the Lord and His
righteousness. The Lord calls upon them, to wait for Him. For the nation
as such, or those who act corruptly, cannot be addressed, since in that
case we should necessarily have to take chakkū lı̄ as ironical (Hitzig,
Maurer); and this would be at variance with the usage of the language,
inasmuch as chikkâh layehōvâh is only used for waiting in a believing
attitude of the Lord and His help ([Psa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#020.md); [Isa
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md); [Isa
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018.md); [Isa
64:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003).md). The lı̄ is still more precisely
defined by ליום וגו, for the day of my rising up for prey. לעד does not
mean εἰς μαρτύριον = לעד (lxx, Syr.), or for a witness (Hitzig), which
does not even yield a suitable thought apart from the alteration in the
pointing, unless we "combine with the witness the accuser and judge"
(Hitzig), or, to speak more correctly, make the witness into a judge;
nor does לעד stand for לעד, in perpetuum, as Jerome has interpreted it
after Jewish commentators, who referred the words to the coming of the
Messiah, "who as they hope will come, and, as they say, will devour the
earth with the fire of His zeal when the nations are gathered together,
and the fury of the Lord is poured out upon them." For "the rising up of
Jehovah for ever" cannot possibly denote the coming of the Messiah, or
be understood as referring to the resurrection of Christ, as Cocceius
supposes, even if the judgment upon the nations is to be inflicted
through the Messiah. לעד means "for prey," that is to say, it is a
concise expression for taking prey, though not in the sense suggested by
Calvin: "Just as lions seize, tear in pieces, and devour; so will I do
with you, because hitherto I have spared you with too much humanity and
paternal care." This neither suits the expression chakkū lı̄, according
to the only meaning of chikkâh that is grammatically established, nor
the verses which follow ([Zep 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md),
[Zep 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010).md), according to which the
judgment to be inflicted upon the nations by the Lord is not an
exterminating but a refining judgment, through which He will turn to the
nations pure lips, to call upon His name. The prey for which Jehovah
will rise up, can only consist, therefore, in the fact, that through the
judgment He obtains from among the nations those who will confess His
name, so that the souls from among the nations which desire salvation
fall to Him as prey (compare [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012.md) with [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md) and [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007).md). It is true that, in order to
gain this victory, it is necessary to exterminate by means of the
judgment the obstinate and hardened sinners. "For my justice (right) is
to gather this." Mishpât does not mean judicium, judgment, here; still
less does it signify decretum, a meaning which it never has; but justice
or right, as in [Zep 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005.md). My justice,
i.e., the justice which I shall bring to the light, consists in the fact
that I pour my fury upon all nations, to exterminate the wicked by
judgments, and to convert the penitent to myself, and prepare for myself
worshippers out of all nations. לשׁפּך is governed by לאסף וגו. God will
gather together the nations, to sift and convert them by severe
judgments. To give the reason for the terrible character and
universality of the judgment, the thought is repeated from [Zep
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#018.md) that "all the earth shall be
devoured in the fire of His zeal." In what follows, the aim and fruit of
the judgment are given; and this forms an introduction to the
announcement of salvation.

[Zephaniah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zep 3:9</span></span>

"For then will I turn to the nations a pure lip, that they may all call
upon the name of Jehovah, to serve Him with one shoulder. [Zep
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010.md). From beyond the rivers of Cush
will they bring my worshippers, the daughter of my dispersed ones, as a
meat-offering to me." By the explanatory kı̄ the promise is connected
with the threat of judgment. The train of thought is this: the believers
are to wait for the judgment, for it will bring them redemption. The
first clause in [Zep 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md) is explained
in different ways. Many commentators understand by sâphâh bherūrâh the
lip of God, which He will turn to the nations through His holy servants.
According to this view, Luther has adopted the rendering: "Then will I
cause the nations to be preached to otherwise, with friendly lips, that
they may all call upon the name of the Lord." But this view, which has
been defended by Cocceius, Mark, and Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, ii. 2, pp.
573-4), would only be admissible if bruur signified clear, evident, - a
meaning which Hofmann assumes as the ground of his explanation: "A
clear, easily intelligible, unmistakeable language does God turn to the
nations, to call them all in the name of Jehovah, that they may serve
Him as one man." But, apart from the inadmissible rendering of קרא בשׁם
יי, this explanation is proved to be erroneous by the fact that bârūr
does not mean clear, intelligible; that even in [Job
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#003.md) it has not this meaning; but that
it simply means pure, purified, sinless; and that sâphâh bherūrâh, the
opposite of טמא שׂפתים in [Isa 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005.md),
cannot be used at all of the lip or language of God, but simply of the
lip of a man who is defiled by sin. Consequently הפך אל must be
explained according to [Sa1 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#009.md),
since the circumstance that we have הפך ל in this passage does not make
any material difference in the meaning. The construction in both
passages is a pregnant one. God turns to the nations a pure lip, by
purifying their sinful lips, i.e., He converts them, that they may be
able to call upon Him with pure lips. Lip does not stand for language,
but is mentioned as the organ of speech, by which a man expresses the
thoughts of his heart, so that purity of the lips involves or
presupposes the purification of the heart. The lips are defiled by the
names of the idols whom they have invoked (cf. [Hos
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019.md); [Psa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004).md). The fruit of the purification
is this, that henceforth they call upon the name of Jehovah, and serve
Him. קרא בשׁם יי, when used of men, always signifies to call solemnly or
heartily upon the name of Jehovah. To serve shekhem 'echâd, with one
shoulder, is to serve together or with unanimity. The metaphor is taken
from bearers who carry a burden with even shoulders; cf. [Jer
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#039.md).

As an example of the way in which they will serve the Lord, it is stated
in [Zep 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010.md) that they will offer the
widely scattered members of the Israelitish church as a sacrifice to the
Lord. Compare [Isa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md), where this
thought is applied to the heathen of all quarters of the globe; whereas
Zephaniah, while fixing his eye upon that passage, has given it more
briefly, and taken the expression "from beyond the rivers of Cush" from
[Isa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md), for the purpose of naming
the remotest heathen nations instar omnium. The rivers of Cush are the
Nile and the Astaboras, with their different tributaries. עתרי בּת
פּוּצי is the accusative of the nearest object, and מנחתי that of the
more remote. ‛Athâr does not mean fragrance (Ges., Ewald, Maurer), but
worshipper, from ‛âthar, to pray, to entreat. The worshippers are more
precisely defined by bath pūtsai, the daughter of my dispersed ones
(pūts, part. pass.), i.e., the crowd or congregation consisting of the
dispersed of the Lord, the members of the Israelitish congregation of
God scattered about in all the world. They are presented to the Lord by
the converted Gentiles as minchâh, a meat-offering, i.e., according to
[Isa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md), just as the children of
Israel offered a meat-offering. In the symbolism of religious worship,
the presentation of the meat-offering shadowed forth diligence in good
works as the fruit of justification. The meaning is therefore the
following: The most remote of the heathen nations will prove that they
are worshippers of Jehovah, by bringing to Him the scattered members of
His nation, or by converting them to the living God. We have here in Old
Testament form the thought expressed by the Apostle Paul in Romans 11,
namely, that the Gentiles have been made partakers of salvation, that
they may incite to emulation the Israelites who have fallen away from
the call of divine grace. The words of the prophet treat of the blessing
which will accrue, from the entrance of the Gentiles into the kingdom of
God, to the Israelites who have been rejected on account of their guilt,
and refer not only to the missionary work of Christians among the Jews
in the stricter sense of the term, but to everything that is done, both
directly and indirectly, through the rise and spread of Christianity
among the nations, for the conversion of the Jews to the Saviour whom
they once despised. Their complete fulfilment, however, will only take
place after the pleroma of the Gentiles has come in, when the πώρωσις,
which in part has happened to Israel, shall be removed, and "all Israel"
shall be saved ([Rom 11:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025).md). On the
other hand, Mark, Hitzig, and others, have taken ‛ăthârai bath pūtsai as
the subject, and understand it as referring to the heathen who have
escaped the judgment by flying in all directions to their own homes, for
example even to Cush, and who having become converted, offer to the Lord
the gift that is His due. But, apart from the parallel passage in [Isa
66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md), which alone is quite decisive,
this view is proved to be untenable by bath pūtsai, daughter of my
dispersed ones. The thought that Jehovah disperses the heathen, either
at the judgment or through the judgment, is foreign to the whole of the
Old Testament, as Hitzig himself appears to have felt, when he changed
pūts, to disperse, into its very opposite - namely, to come home. The
thought, on the other hand, that God will disperse His people Israel
among all nations on account of their sins, and will hereafter gather
them together again, is a truth expressed even in the song of Moses, and
one which recurs in all the prophets, so that every hearer or reader of
our prophet must think at once of the Israel scattered abroad in
connection with the expression "my (i.e., Jehovah's) dispersed ones."
The objection, that Judah is first spoken of in [Zep
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011) (Hitzig.md), is thereby deprived of
all its significance, even if this really were the case. But the
objection is also incorrect, since the Judaeans have been already
addressed in [Zep 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md) in the
expression חכּוּ לי.

[Zephaniah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zep 3:11</span></span>

"In that day wilt thou not be ashamed of all thy doings, wherewith thou
hast transgressed against me; for then will I remove from the midst of
thee those that rejoice in thy pride, and thou wilt no more pride
thyself upon my holy mountain. [Zep
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#012.md). And I leave in the midst of thee
a people bowed down and poor, and they trust in the name of Jehovah.
[Zep 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#013.md). The remnant of Israel will
not do wrong, and not speak lies, and there will not be found in their
mouth a tongue of deceit; for they will feed and rest, and no one will
terrify them." The congregation, being restored to favour, will be
cleansed and sanctified by the Lord from every sinful thing. The words
of [Zep 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011.md) are addressed to the
Israel gathered together from the dispersion, as the daughter of Zion
(cf. [Zep 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#014).md). "In that day" refers
to the time of judgment mentioned before, viz., to the day when Jehovah
rises up for prey ([Zep 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008).md). לא
תבושׁי, thou wilt not need to be ashamed of all thine iniquities;
because, as the explanatory clauses which follow clearly show, they
occur no more. This is the meaning of the words, and not, as Ewald
imagines, that Jerusalem will no more be bowed down by the recollection
of them. The perfect אשׁר פּשׁעתּ does indeed point to the sins of
former times; not to the recollection of them, however, but to the
commission of them. For the proud and sinners will then be exterminated
from the congregation. עלּיזי גאוה is taken from [Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003.md), where it denotes the heroes
called by Jehovah, who exult with pride caused by the intoxication of
victory; whereas here the reference is to the haughty judges, priests,
and prophets ([Zep 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md) and [Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004).md), who exult in their sinful ways.
גּבהה a feminine form of the infinitive, like moshchâh in [Exo
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#029.md), etc. (cf. Ges. 45, 1, b, and
Ewald, 236, a). גּבהּ, to be haughty, as in [Isa
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md). The prophet mentions pride as
the root of all sins. The holy mountain is not Canaan as a mountainous
country, but the temple mountain, as in the parallel passage, [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md). The people left by the Lord,
i.e., spared in the judgment, and gathered together again out of the
dispersion, will be ‛ânı̄ and dal. The two words are often connected
together as synonyms, e.g., [Isa 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#006.md)
and [Job 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#028.md). עני is not to be
confounded with ענו, gentle or meek, but signifies bowed down, oppressed
with the feeling of impotence for what is good, and the knowledge that
deliverance is due to the compassionate grace of God alone; it is
therefore the opposite of proud, which trusts in its own strength, and
boasts of its own virtue. The leading characteristic of those who are
bowed down will be trust in the Lord, the spiritual stamp of genuine
piety. This remnant of Israel, the ἐκλογή of the people of God, will
neither commit injustice, nor practise wickedness and deceit with word
and tongue, will therefore be a holy nation, answering to its divine
calling ([Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006).md), just as God does
not wrong ([Zep 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005).md), and the servant
of Jehovah has no deceit in his mouth ([Isa
53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009).md). What is stated here can, of
course, not refer to those who were brought back from Babylon, as Calvin
supposes, taking the words comparatively, because there were many
hypocrites among the exiles, and adding, "because the Lord will thus
wipe away all stains from His people, that the holiness may then appear
all the purer." The prophetic announcement refers to the time of
perfection, which commenced with the coming of Christ, and will be
completely realized at His return to judgment. Strauss very
appropriately compares the words of John, "Whatsoever is born of God
doth not commit sin" ([Jo1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009).md).
Zephaniah explains what he says, by adding the assurance of the blessing
which is promised in the law as the reward of faithful walk in the
commandments of the Lord. This reason rests upon the assumption that
they only rejoice in the promised blessing who walk in the commandments
of God. In this respect the enjoyment of the blessing yields a practical
proof that wrong and wickedness occur no more. The words ירעוּ ורבצוּ
may be explained from the comparison of the remnant of Israel to a flock
both in [Mic 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md) and [Luk
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032.md) ("little flock;" for the fact
itself, compare [Mic 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004).md). This
blessing is still further developed in what follows, first of all by a
reference to the removal of the judgments of God ([Zep
3:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#014).md), and secondly by the promise
of God that all the obstacles which prevent the enjoyment of the
blessing are to be cleared away ([Zep
3:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#018).md).

[Zephaniah 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zep 3:14</span></span>

"Exult, O daughter Zion; shout, O Israel! rejoice and exult with all the
heart, O daughter Jerusalem. [Zep
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#015.md). Jehovah has removed thy
judgments, cleared away thine enemy; the King of Israel, Jehovah, is in
the midst of thee: thou wilt see evil no more. [Zep
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#016.md). In that day will men say to
Jerusalem, Fear not, O Zion; let not thy hands drop. [Zep
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017.md). Jehovah thy God is in the midst
of thee, a hero who helps: He rejoices over thee in delight, He is
silent in His love, exults over thee with rejoicing." The daughter Zion,
i.e., the reassembled remnant of Israel, is to exult and shout at the
fulness of the salvation prepared for it. The fulness is indicated in
the heaping up of words for exulting and rejoicing. The greater the
exultation, the greater must the object be over which men exult. הריעוּ,
to break out into a cry of joy, is a plural, because the Israel
addressed is a plurality. The re-establishment of the covenant of grace
assigns the reason for the exultation. God has removed the judgments,
and cleared away the enemies, who served as the executors of His
judgments. Pinnâh, piel, to put in order (sc., a house), by clearing
away what is lying about in disorder ([Gen
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#031.md); [Lev
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#036).md), hence to sweep away or remove.
'Oyēbh: with indefinite generality, every enemy. Now is Jehovah once
more in the midst of the daughter Zion as King of Israel, whereas, so
long as Israel was given up to the power of the enemy, He had ceased to
be its King. Yehōvâh is in apposition to melekj Yisrâ'ēl, which is
placed first for the sake of emphasis, and not a predicate. The
predicate is merely בּקרבּך (in the midst of thee). The accent lies upon
the fact that Jehovah is in the midst of His congregation as King of
Israel (cf. [Zep 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017).md). Because this
is the case, she will no more see, i.e., experience, evil (ראה as in
[Jer 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012.md); [Isa
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#016), etc..md), and need not therefore
any longer fear and despair. This is stated in [Zep
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#016.md) : They will say to Jerusalem,
Fear not. She will have so little fear, that men will be able to call
her the fearless one. ציּון is a vocative of address. It is simpler to
assume this than to supply ל from the previous clause. The falling of
the hands is a sign of despair through alarm and anxiety (cf. [Isa
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#007).md). This thought is still further
explained in [Zep 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017.md). Jehovah, the
God of Zion, is within her, and is a hero who helps or saves; He has
inward joy in His rescued and blessed people (cf. [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md); [Isa
65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019).md). יחרישׁ בּאחבתו appears
unsuitable, since we cannot think of it as indicating silence as to sins
that may occur (cf. [Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021.md); [Isa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#014).md), inasmuch as, according to [Zep
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#013.md), the remnant of Israel commits no
sin. Ewald and Hitzig would therefore read yachădı̄sh; and Ewald renders
it "he will grow young again," which Hitzig rejects as at variance with
the language, because we should then have יתחדּשׁ. He therefore takes
yachădı̄sh as synonymous with יעשׂה חדשׁות, he will do a new thing ([Isa
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019).md). But this rendering cannot be
justified by the usage of the language, and does not even yield a
thought in harmony with the context. Silence in His love is an
expression used to denote love deeply felt, which is absorbed in its
object with thoughtfulness and admiration,

(Note: "He assumes the person of a mortal man, because, unless He
stammers in this manner, He cannot sufficiently show how much He loves
us. Thy God will therefore be quiet in His love, i.e., this will be the
greatest delight of thy God, this His chief pleasure, when He shall
cherish thee. As a man caresses his dearest wife, so will God then
quietly repose in thy love." - Calvin.)

and forms the correlate to rejoicing with exultation, i.e., to the loud
demonstration of one's love. The two clauses contain simply a
description, drawn from man's mode of showing love, and transferred to
God, to set forth the great satisfaction which the Lord has in His
redeemed people, and are merely a poetical filling up of the expression,
"He will rejoice over thee with joy." This joy of His love will the Lord
extend to all who are troubled and pine in misery.

[Zephaniah 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zep 3:18</span></span>

"I gather together those that mourn for the festive meeting; they are of
thee; reproach presses upon them. [Zep
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019.md). Behold, at that time I will
treat with all thine oppressors, and will save the limping, and gather
together that which is dispersed, and make them a praise and a name in
every land of their shame. [Zep 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#020.md).
At that time will I bring you and gather you in time; for I will make
you a name and a praise among all the nations of the earth, when I turn
your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah." The salvation held up
in prospect before the remnant of Israel, which has been refined by the
judgments and delivered, was at a very remote distance in Zephaniah's
time. The first thing that awaited the nation was the judgment, through
which it was to be dispersed among the heathen, according to the
testimony of Moses and all the prophets, and to be refined in the
furnace of affliction. The ten tribes were already carried away into
exile, and Judah was to share the same fate immediately afterwards. In
order, therefore, to offer to the pious a firm consolation of hope in
the period of suffering that awaited them, and one on which their faith
could rest in the midst of tribulation, Zephaniah mentions in conclusion
the gathering together of all who pine in misery at a distance from
Zion, and who are scattered far and wide, to assure even these of their
future participation in the promised salvation. Every clause of [Zep
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#018.md) is difficult. נוּגי is a niphal
participle of יגה, with וּ instead of ו, as in [Lam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md), in the sense of to mourn, or be
troubled. Mō‛ēd, the time of the feast, when all Israel gathered
together to rejoice before Jehovah, as in [Hos
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010.md), except that the word is not to
be restricted to the feast of tabernacles, but may be understood as
relating to all the feasts to which pilgrimages were made. The
preposition min is taken by many in the sense of far from; in support of
which Hitzig appeals to [Lam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md). But
that passage is rather opposed to the application of the meaning
referred to, inasmuch as we have מבּלי there, in which min denotes the
cause. And this causal signification is to be retained here also, if
only because of the close connection between נוּגי and ממּועד, according
to which the dependent word can only denote the object or occasion of
the nōgâh. Those who are troubled for the festal meeting are they who
mourn because they cannot participate in the joy of assembling before
the face of the Lord, namely, on account of their banishment into
foreign lands. Mimmēkh hâyū, from thee were they, i.e., they have been
thine (min expressing descent or origin, as in [Isa
58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012.md); [Ezr
2:59](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#059.md); [Psa
68:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#027.md); and the whole clause containing
the reason for their meeting). The explanation given by Anton and
Strauss is unsuitable and forced: "They will be away from thee, namely,
separated from thee as mourners." In the last clause it is a matter of
dispute to what the suffix in עליה refers. The explanation of Strauss,
that it refers to Zion, is precluded by the fact that Zion is itself
addressed, both in what precedes and what follows, and the thought does
not require so rapid a change of persons. It is more natural to refer it
to נוּגי, in which case the singular suffix is used collectively as a
neuter, like the feminines הצּלעה and הנּדּחה; and the meaning takes
this form: a burden upon them, viz., those who mourned for the feasts,
was the reproach, sc. of slavery among the heathen (compare [Zep
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019), at the close.md). Consequently the
clause assigns a still further reason for the promise, that they are to
be gathered together.

In [Zep 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019.md), עשׂה with את signifies
neither to handle in an evil sense, nor comprimere, conculcare, but to
treat or negotiate with a person, as in [Eze
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#025.md) and [Eze
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017.md), where אות, according to a later
usage of the language, is a preposition, and not a sign of the
accusative. The more precise definition of the procedure, or of the kind
of negotiation, is evident from the context. The reference is to a
punitive procedure, or treating in wrath. מענּיך as in Ps. 60:14, the
heathen nations who had subjugated Israel. What follows is taken almost
verbatim from [Mic 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006.md); and the last
clause points back to [Deu 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019.md), to
tell the people that the Lord will assuredly realize the glorification
promised to the people of His possession, and make Israel an object of
praise to the whole earth. בּכל־הארץ בּשׁתּם, in all lands, where they
have suffered shame. Boshtâm is epexegetical of hâ'ârets, which governs
it; this explains the use of the article with the nomen regens (cf.
Ewald, 290, d). In order to paint the glory of the future salvation in
still more vivid colours before the eyes of the people, the Lord ends by
repeating this promise once more, with a slight change in the words. At
that time will I lead you. The indefinite אביא might be expounded from
the context, by supplying the place to which God will lead them, after
such passages as [Isa 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002.md); [Isa
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005.md). But it is more natural to think
of the phrase, to lead out and in, according to [Num
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#017.md), and to take אביא as an
abbreviation of הוציא והביא, picturing the pastoral fidelity with which
the Lord will guide the redeemed. The following words קבּצי אתכם point
to this: compare [Isa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md), where the
gathering of the lambs is added to the feeding of the flock, to give
prominence to the faithful care of the shepherds for the weak and
helpless. קבּצי is the infinitive: my gathering you, sc. will take
place. The choice of this form is to be traced, as Hitzig supposes, to
the endeavour to secure uniformity in the clauses. A fresh reason is
then assigned for the promise, by a further allusion to the
glorification appointed for the people of God above all the nations of
the earth, coupled with the statement that this will take place at the
turning of their captivity, i.e., when God shall abolish the misery of
His people, and turn it into salvation ("turn the captivity," as in [Zep
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007).md), and that "before your eyes;"
i.e., not that "ye yourselves shall see the salvation, and not merely
your children, when they have closed your eyes" (Hitzig) - for such an
antithesis would be foreign to the context - but as equivalent to "quite
obviously, so that the turn in events stands out before the eye,"
analogous to "ye will see eye to eye" ([Isa
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md); cf. [Luk
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#030).md). This will assuredly take place,
for Jehovah has spoken it.

On the fulfilment of this promise, Theodoret observes that "these things
were bestowed upon those who came from Babylon, and have been offered to
all men since then." This no doubt indicates certain points of the
fulfilment, but the principal fulfilment is generalized too much. For
although the promise retains its perfect validity in the case of the
Christian church, which is gathered out of both Jews and Gentiles, and
will receive its final accomplishment in the completion of the kingdom
of heaven founded by Christ on the earth, the allusion to the Gentile
Christians falls quite into the background in the picture of salvation
in [Zep 3:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011.md), and the prophet's eye
is simply directed towards Israel, and the salvation reserved for the
rescued ἐκλογὴ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. But inasmuch as Zephaniah not only announces
the judgment upon the whole earth, but also predicts the conversion of
the heathen nations to Jehovah the living God ([Zep
3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009).md), we must not restrict the
description of salvation in [Zep
3:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011.md) to the people of Israel who
were lineally descended from Abraham, and to the remnant of them; but
must also regard the Gentiles converted to the living God through Christ
as included among them, and must consequently say that the salvation
which the Lord will procure through the judgment for the daughter Zion
or the remnant of Israel, commenced with the founding of the Christian
church by the apostles for Judah and the whole world, and has been
gradually unfolded more and more through the spread of the name of the
Lord and His worship among all nations, and will be eventually and fully
realized at the second coming of Christ, to the last judgment, and to
perfect His kingdom in the establishment of the New Jerusalem
(Revelation 21 and 22). It is true that both the judgment and the
salvation of the remnant of Israel seeking Jehovah and His righteousness
commenced even before Christ, with the giving up of Judah, together with
all the tribes and kingdoms falling within the horizon of Old Testament
prophecy, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar and the imperial rulers who
followed him; but so far as the question of the fulfilment of our
prophecy is concerned, these events come into consideration merely as
preliminary stages of and preparations for the times of decision, which
commenced with Christ not only for the Jews, but for all nations.
