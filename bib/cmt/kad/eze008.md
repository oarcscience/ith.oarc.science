Vision of the Destruction of Jerusalem - Ezekiel 8-11

A year and two months after his call, the glory of the Lord appeared to
the prophet a second time, as he had seen it by the Chebar. He is
transported in spirit to Jerusalem into the court of the temple ([Eze
8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001).md), where the Lord causes him to
see, first the idolatry of Israel ([Eze
8:5-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005).md), and secondly, the judgment
why, on account of this idolatry, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem are
smitten ([Eze 9:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001).md), the city is
burned with fire, and the sanctuary forsaken by God (Ezekiel 10).
Lastly, after he has been charged to foretell to the representatives of
the people more especially the coming judgment, and to those who are
sent into exile a future salvation (Ezekiel 11:1-21), he describes how
the gracious presence of God forsakes the city before his own eyes ([Eze
11:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#022).md). After this has taken place,
Ezekiel is carried back in the vision to Chaldea once more; and there,
after the vision has come to an end, he announces to the exiles what he
has seen and heard ([Eze 11:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#024).md).

Abominations of the Idolatry of the House of Israel

Time and place of the divine revelation. - [Eze
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md). And it came to pass in the sixth
year, in the sixth (month), on the fifth (day) of the month, I was
sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me;
there fell upon me the hand of the Lord Jehovah there. [Eze
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002.md). And I saw, and behold a figure
like the look of fire, from the look of its loins downwards fire, and
from its loins upwards like a look of brilliance, like the sight of
red-hot brass. [Eze 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003.md). And he
stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by the locks of my head,
and wind carried me away between earth and heaven, and brought me to
Jerusalem in visions of God, to the entrance of the gate of the inner
court, which faces towards the north, where the image of jealousy
exciting jealousy had its stand. [Eze
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#004.md). And, behold, the glory of the God
of Israel was there, like the vision which I have seen in the valley. -
The place where Ezekiel received this new theophany agrees with the
statements in [Eze 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024.md) and [Eze
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#004.md), [Eze
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006.md), that he was to shut himself up in
his house, and lie 390 days upon the left side, and 40 days upon the
right side - in all, 430 days. The use of the word יושׁב, "I sat," is
not at variance with this, as ישׁב does not of necessity signify sitting
as contrasted with lying, but may also be used in the more general sense
of staying, or living, in the house. Nor is the presence of the elders
of Judah opposed to the command, in [Eze
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024.md), to shut himself up in the house,
as we have already observed in the notes on that passage. The new
revelation is made to him in the presence of these elders, because it is
of the greatest importance to them. They are to be witnesses of his
ecstasy; and after this has left the prophet, are to hear from his lips
the substance of the divine revelation ([Eze
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#025).md). It is otherwise with the time
of the revelation. If we compare the date given in [Eze
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md) with those mentioned before, this
new vision apparently falls within the period required for carrying out
the symbolical actions of the previous vision. Between [Eze
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md) (the fifth day of the fourth
month in the fifth year) and [Eze 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md)
(the fifth day of the sixth month in the sixth year) we have one year
and two months, that is to say (reckoning the year as a lunar year at
354 days, and the two months at 59 days), 413 days; whereas the two
events recorded in Ezekiel 1-7 require at least 437 days, namely 7 days
for [Eze 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015.md), and 390 + 40 = 430 days
for [Eze 4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005.md). Consequently the new
theophany would fall within the 40 days, during which Ezekiel was to lie
upon the right side for Judah. To get rid of this difficulty, Hitzig
conjectures that the fifth year of Jehoiachin ([Eze
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002).md) was a leap year of 13 months or
385 days, by which he obtains an interval of 444 days after adding 59
for the two months, - a period sufficient not only to include the 7 days
([Eze 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015).md) and 390 + 40 days ([Eze
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005).md), but to leave 7 days for the
time that elapsed between Ezekiel 7 and 8. But however attractive this
reckoning may appear, the assumption that the fifth year of the
captivity of Jehoiachin was a leap year is purely conjectural; and there
is nothing whatever to give it probability. Consequently the only thing
that could lead us to adopt such a solution, would be the impossibility
of reconciling the conclusion to be drawn from the chronological data,
as to the time of the two theophanies, with the substance of these
divine revelations.

If we assume that Ezekiel carried out the symbolical acts mentioned in
Ezekiel 4 and 5 in all their entirety, we can hardly imagine that the
vision described in the chapters before us, by which he was transported
in spirit to Jerusalem, occurred within the period of forty days, during
which he was to typify the siege of Jerusalem by lying upon his right
side. Nevertheless, Kliefoth has decided in favour of this view, and
argues in support of it, that the vision described in [Eze
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md). took place in the prophet's own
house, that it is identical in substance with what is contained in
Ezekiel 3:22-7:27, and that there is no discrepancy, because all that
occurred here was purely internal, and the prophet himself was to
address the words contained in [Eze
11:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#004.md) and [Eze
11:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#014.md) to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem in his state of ecstasy. Moreover, when it is stated in [Eze
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#025.md) that Ezekiel related to the
exiles all that he had seen in the vision, it is perfectly open to us to
assume that this took place at the same time as his report to them of
the words of God in [Eze 6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md) and 7,
and those which follow in Ezekiel 12. But. on the other hand, it may be
replied that the impression produced by [Eze
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#025.md) is not that the prophet waited
several weeks after his visionary transport to Jerusalem before
communicating to the elders what he saw in the vision. And even if the
possibility of this cannot be disputed, we cannot imagine any reason why
the vision should be shown to the prophet four weeks before it was to be
related to the exiles. Again, there is not sufficient identity between
the substance of the vision in Ezekiel 8-11 and the revelation in
Ezekiel 4-7, to suggest any motive for the two to coincide. It is true
that the burning of Jerusalem, which Ezekiel sees in Ezekiel 8-11, is
consequent upon the siege and conquest of that city, which he has
already predicted in Ezekiel 4-7 both in figure and word; but they are
not so closely connected, that it was necessary on account of this
connection for it to be shown to him before the completion of the
symbolical siege of Jerusalem. And, lastly, although the ecstasy as a
purely internal process is so far reconcilable with the prophet's lying
upon his right side, that this posture did not preclude a state of
ecstasy or render it impossible, yet this collision would ensue, that
while the prophet was engaged in carrying out the former word of God, a
new theophany would be received by him, which must necessarily abstract
his mind from the execution of the previous command of God, and place
him in a condition in which it would be impossible for him to set his
face firmly upon the siege of Jerusalem, as he had been commanded to do
in [Eze 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#007.md). On account of this
collision, we cannot subscribe to the assumption, that it was during the
time that Ezekiel was lying bound by God upon his right side to bear the
sin of Jerusalem, that he was transported in spirit to the temple at
Jerusalem. On the contrary, the fact that this transport occurred,
according to [Eze 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md), at a time when
he could not have ended the symbolical acts of Ezekiel 4, if he had been
required to carry them out in all their external reality, furnishes us
with conclusive evidence of the correctness of the view we have already
expressed, that the symbolical acts of Ezekiel 4 and 5 did not lie
within the sphere of outward reality (see comm. on [Eze
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#004).md). - And if Ezekiel did not really
lie for 430 days, there was nothing to hinder his having a fresh vision
14 months after the theophany in Ezekiel 1 and [Eze
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md). For 'תּפּל עלי יד , see at [Eze
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md) and [Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003.md).

The figure which Ezekiel sees in the vision is described in [Eze
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002.md) in precisely the same terms as the
appearance of God in [Eze 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#027.md). The
sameness of the two passages is a sufficient defence of the reading
כּמראה־אשׁ against the arbitrary emendation אישׁ 'כם, after the Sept.
rendering ὁμοίωμα ἀνδρός, in support of which Ewald and Hitzig appeal to
[Eze 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md), though without any reason,
as the reading there is not אישׁ, but אדם. It is not expressly stated
here that the apparition was in human form - the fiery appearance is all
that is mentioned; but this is taken for granted in the allusion to the
מתנים (the loins), either as self-evident, or as well known from Ezekiel
1. זהר is synonymous with נגהּ in [Eze
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004.md), [Eze
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#027.md). What is new in the present
theophany is the stretching out of the hand, which grasps the prophet by
the front hair of his head, whereupon he is carried by wind between
heaven and earth, i.e., through the air, to Jerusalem, not in the body,
but in visions of God (cf. [Eze 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001).md),
that is to say, in spiritual ecstasy, and deposited at the entrance of
the inner northern door of the temple. הפּנימית is not an adjective
belonging to שׁער, for this is not a feminine noun, but is used as a
substantive, as in [Eze 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#005.md) (= החצר
הפּנימית: cf. [Eze 40:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#040).md): gate of the
inner court, i.e., the gate on the north side of the inner court which
led into the outer court. We are not informed whether Ezekiel was placed
on the inner or outer side of this gate, i.e., in the inner or outer
court; but it is evident from [Eze 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005.md)
that he was placed in the inner court, as his position commanded a view
of the image which stood at the entrance of the gate towards the north.
The further statement, "where the standing place of the image of
jealousy was," anticipates what follows, and points out the reason why
the prophet was placed just there. The expression "image of jealousy" is
explained by המּקנה, which excites the jealousy of Jehovah (see the
comm. on [Exo 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).md). Consequently, we
have not to think of any image of Jehovah, but of an image of a heathen
idol (cf. [Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021).md); probably of
Baal or Asherah, whose image had already been placed in the temple by
Manasseh ([Kg2 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007).md); certainly not
the image of the corpse of Adonis moulded in wax or clay. This opinion,
which Hvernick advances, is connected with the erroneous assumption that
all the idolatrous abominations mentioned in this chapter relate to the
celebration of an Adonis-festival in the temple. There ([Eze
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#004).md) in the court of the temple
Ezekiel saw once more the glory of the God of Israel, as he had seen it
in the valley ([Eze 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022).md) by the
Chaboras, i.e., the appearance of God upon the throne with the cherubim
and wheels; whereas the divine figure, whose hand grasped him in his
house, and transported him to the temple ([Eze
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002).md), showed neither throne nor
cherubim. The expression "God of Israel," instead of Jehovah ([Eze
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023).md), is chosen as an antithesis to
the strange god, the heathen idol, whose image stood in the temple. As
the God of Israel, Jehovah cannot tolerate the image and worship of
another god in His temple. To set up such an image in the temple of
Jehovah was a practical renunciation of the covenant, a rejection of
Jehovah on the part of Israel as its covenant God.

Here, in the temple, Jehovah shows to the prophet the various kinds of
idolatry which Israel is practising both publicly and privately, not
merely in the temple, but throughout the whole land. The arrangement of
these different forms of idolatry in four groups of abomination scenes
([Eze 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005.md), [Eze
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#006.md), [Eze
8:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007.md), [Eze
8:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#013.md), and [Eze
8:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016).md), which the prophet sees both
in and from the court of the temple, belong to the visionary drapery of
this divine revelation. It is altogether erroneous to interpret the
vision as signifying that all these forms of idolatry were practised in
the temple itself; an assumption which cannot be carried out without
doing violence to the description, more especially of the second
abomination in [Eze 8:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007.md). Still more
untenable is Hvernick's view, that the four pictures of idolatrous
practices shown to the prophet are only intended to represent different
scenes of a festival of Adonis held in the temple. The selection of the
courts of the temple for depicting the idolatrous worship, arises from
the fact that the temple was the place where Israel was called to
worship the Lord its God. Consequently the apostasy of Israel from the
Lord could not be depicted more clearly and strikingly than by the
following series of pictures of idolatrous abominations practised in the
temple under the eyes of God.

[Ezekiel 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 8:5</span></span>

First Abomination-Picture

[Eze 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005.md). And He said to me, Son of
man, lift up thine eyes now towards the north. And I lifted up my eyes
towards the north, and, behold, to the north of the gate of the altar
was this image of jealousy at the entrance. [Eze
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#006.md). And He said to me, Son of man,
seest thou what they do? great abominations, which the house of Israel
doeth here, that I may go far away from my sanctuary; and thou shalt yet
again see greater abominations still. - As Ezekiel had taken his stand
in the inner court at the entrance of the north gate, and when looking
thence towards the north saw the image of jealousy to the north of the
altar gate, the image must have stood on the outer side of the entrance,
so that the prophet saw it as he looked through the open doorway. The
altar gate is the same as the northern gate of the inner court mentioned
in Ezekiel 3. But it is impossible to state with certainty how it came
to be called the altar gate. Possibly from the circumstance that the
sacrificial animals were taken through this gate to the altar, to be
slaughtered on the northern side of the altar, according to [Lev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004.md); [Lev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011.md), etc. מהם, contracted from מה־הם,
like מזּה from מה זה in [Exo 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002.md). The
words "what they are doing here" do not force us to assume that at that
very time they were worshipping the idol. They simply describe what was
generally practised there. The setting up of the image involved the
worship of it. The subject to לרחקה is not the house of Israel, but
Jehovah. They perform great abominations, so that Jehovah is compelled
to go to a distance from His sanctuary, i.e., to forsake it (cf. [Eze
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#023).md), because they make it an
idol-temple.

[Ezekiel 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 8:7</span></span>

Second Abomination: Worship of Beasts

[Eze 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007.md). And He brought me to the
entrance of the court, and I saw, and behold there was a hole in the
wall. [Eze 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#008.md). And He said to me, Son
of man, break through the wall: and I broke through the wall, and behold
there was a door. [Eze 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#009.md). And He
said to me, Come and see the wicked abominations which they are doing
here. [Eze 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010.md). And I came and saw,
and behold there were all kinds of figures of reptiles, and beasts,
abominations, and all kinds of idols of the house of Israel, drawn on
the wall round about. [Eze 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011.md). And
seventy men of the leaders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the
son of Shaphan standing among them, stood in front, every man with his
censer in his hand; and the smell of a cloud of incense arose. [Eze
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012.md). And He said to me, Seest thou,
son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every
one in his image-chambers? For they say: Jehovah doth not see us;
Jehovah hath forsaken the land. - The entrance of the court to which
Ezekiel was now transported cannot be the principal entrance to the
outer court towards the east (Ewald). This would be at variance with the
context, as we not only find the prophet at the northern entrance in
[Eze 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003.md) and [Eze
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005.md), but at [Eze
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014.md) we find him there still. If he
had been taken to the eastern gate in the meantime, this would certainly
have been mentioned. As that is not the case, the reference must be to
that entrance to the court which lay between the entrance-gate of the
inner court ([Eze 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003).md) and the
northern entrance-gate to the house of Jehovah ([Eze
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014).md), or northern gate of the outer
court, in other words, the northern entrance into the outer court. Thus
the prophet was conducted out of the inner court through its northern
gate into the outer court, and placed in front of the northern gate,
which led out into the open air. There he saw a hole in the wall, and on
breaking through the wall, by the command of God, he saw a door, and
having entered it, he saw all kinds of figures of animals engraved on
the wall round about, in front of which seventy of the elders of Israel
were standing and paying reverence to the images of beasts with burning
incense. According to [Eze 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012.md), the
prophet was thereby shown what the elders of Israel did in the dark,
every one in his image-chamber. From this explanation on the part of God
concerning the picture shown to the prophet, it is very evident that it
had no reference to any idolatrous worship practised by the elders in
one or more of the cells of the outer court of the temple. For even
though the objection raised by Kliefoth to this view, namely, that it
cannot be proved that there were halls with recesses in the outer court,
is neither valid nor correct, since the existence of such halls is
placed beyond the reach of doubt by [Jer
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#004.md); [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md), and [Ch1
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012.md); such a supposition is decidedly
precluded by the fact, that the cells and recesses at the gates cannot
have been large enough to allow of seventy-one men taking part in a
festive idolatrous service. The supposition that the seventy-one men
were distributed in different chambers is at variance with the distinct
words of the text. The prophet not only sees the seventy elders standing
along with Jaazaniah, but he could not look through one door into a
number of chambers at once, and see the pictures draw all round upon
their walls. The assembling of the seventy elders in a secret cell by
the northern gate of the outer temple to worship the idolatrous images
engraved on the walls of the cell, is one feature in the visionary form
given to the revelation of what the elders of the people were doing
secretly throughout the whole land. To bring out more strikingly the
secrecy of this idolatrous worship, the cell is so completely hidden in
the wall, that the prophet is obliged to enlarge the hole by breaking
through the wall before he can see the door which leads to the cell and
gain a view of them and of the things it contains, and the things that
are done therein.

(Note: "Because the whole is exhibited pictorially and figuratively, he
says that he saw one hole in a wall, and was directed to dig through and
make it larger, that he might enter as if through an open door, and see
the things which he could not possibly have seen while stationed
outside." - Jerome.)

And the number of the persons assembled there suggests the idea of a
symbolical representation, as well as the secrecy of the cell. The
seventy elders represent the whole nation; and the number is taken from
[Exo 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md). and [Num
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#016.md); [Num
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#025.md), where Moses, by the command of
God, chooses seventy of the elders to represent the whole congregation
at the making of the covenant, and afterwards to support his authority.
This representation of the congregation was not a permanent institution,
as we may see from the fact that in Num 11 seventy other men are said to
have been chosen for the purpose named. The high council, consisting of
seventy members, the so-called Sanhedrim, was formed after the captivity
on the basis of these Mosaic types. In the midst of the seventy was
Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, a different man therefore from the
Jaazaniah mentioned in [Eze 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001.md).
Shaphan is probably the person mentioned as a man of distinction in [Kg2
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003.md).; [Jer
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003.md); [Jer
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010.md); [Jer
39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014.md). It is impossible to decide on
what ground Jaazaniah is specially mentioned by name; but it can hardly
be on account of the meaning of the name he bore, "Jehovah heard," as
Hvernick supposes. It is probable that he held a prominent position
among the elders of the nation, so that he is mentioned here by name as
the leader of this national representation.

On the wall of the chamber round about there were drawn all kinds of
figures of רמשׂ וּבהמה, reptiles and quadrupeds (see [Gen
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024).md). שׁקץ is in apposition not only
to בּהמה, but also to רמשׂ, and therefore, as belonging to both, is not
to be connected with בּהמה in the construct state. The drawing of
reptiles and quadrupeds became a sheqetz, or abomination, from the fact
that the pictures had been drawn for the purpose of religious worship.
The following clause, "and all the idols of the house of Israel," is
co-ordinate with 'כּל־תּבנית וגו. Besides the animals drawn on the
walls, there were idols of other kinds in the chamber. The drawing of
reptiles and quadrupeds naturally suggests the thought of the
animal-worship of Egypt. We must not limit the words to this, however,
since the worship of animals is met with in the nature-worship of other
heathen nations, and the expression כּל־תּבנית, "all kinds of figures,"
as well as the clause, "all kinds of idols of the house of Israel,"
points to every possible form of idol-worship as spread abroad in
Israel. עתר, according to the Aramaean usage, signifies suffimentum,
perfume, בּחשׁך, in the dark, i.e., in secret, like בּסּתר in [Sa2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#012.md); not in the sacred darkness of
the cloud of incense (Hvernick). חדרי משׂכּית, image-chambers, is the
term applied to the rooms or closets in the dwelling-houses of the
people in which idolatrous images were set up and secretly worshipped.
משׂכּית signifies idolatrous figures, as in [Lev
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md) and [Num
33:52](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#052.md). This idolatry was justified by
the elders, under the delusion that "Jehovah seeth us not;" that is to
say, not: "He does not trouble Himself about us," but He does not see
what we do, because He is not omniscient (cf. [Isa
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015).md); and He has forsaken the land,
withdrawn His presence and His help. Thus they deny both the omniscience
and omnipresence of God (cf. [Eze
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009).md).

Third Abomination: Worship of Thammuz

[Eze 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#013.md). And He said to me, Thou
shalt yet again see still greater abominations which they do. [Eze
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014.md). And He brought me to the
entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah, which is towards the
north, and behold there sat the women, weeping for Thammuz. [Eze
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#015.md). And He said to me, Dost thou see
it, O son of man? Thou shalt yet again see still greater abominations
than these. - The prophet is taken from the entrance into the court to
the entrance of the gate of the temple, to see the women sitting there
weeping for Thammuz. The article in הנּשׁים is used generically. Whilst
the men of the nation, represented by the seventy elders, were secretly
carrying on their idolatrous worship, the women were sitting at the
temple gate, and indulging in public lamentation for Thammuz. Under the
weeping for Thammuz, Jerome (with Melito of Sardis and all the Greek
Fathers) has correctly recognised the worship of Adonis. "תּמּוּז,
Θαμμούζ or Θαμμούς," says Jerome, "whom we have interpreted as Adonis,
is called Thamuz both in Hebrew and Syriac; and because, according to
the heathen legend, this lover of Venus and most beautiful youth is said
to have been slain in the month of June and then restored to life again,
they call this month of June by the same name, and keep an annual
festival in his honour, at which he is lamented by women as though he
were dead, and then afterwards celebrated in songs as having come to
life again." This view has not been shaken even by the objections raised
by Chwolson in his Ssaabins (II. 27. 202ff.), his relics of early
Babylonian literature (p. 101), and his Tammuz and human-worship among
the ancient Babylonians. For the myth of Thammuz, mentioned in the
Nabataean writings as a man who was put to death by the king of Babylon,
whom he had commanded to introduce the worship of the seven planets and
the twelve signs of the zodiac, and who was exalted to a god after his
death, and honoured with a mourning festival, is nothing more than a
refined interpretation of the very ancient nature-worship which spread
over the whole of Hither Asia, and in which the power of the sun over
the vegetation of the year was celebrated. The etymology of the word
Tammuz is doubtful. It is probably a contraction of תּמזוּז, from מזז =
מסס, so that it denotes the decay of the force of nature, and
corresponds to the Greek ἀφανισμὸς ̓Αδώνιδος (see Hvernick in loc.).

Fourth Abomination: Worship of the Sun by the Priests

[Eze 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md). And He took me into the
inner court of the house of Jehovah, and behold, at the entrance into
the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, as it were five
and twenty men,with their backs towards the temple of Jehovah and their
faces towards the east; they were worshipping the sun towards the east.
[Eze 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017.md). And He said to me, Seest
thou this, son of Man? Is it too little for the house of Judah to
perform the abominations which they are performing here, that they also
fill the land with violence, and provoke me to anger again and again?
For behold they stretch out the vine-branch to their nose. [Eze
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018.md). But I also will act in fury; my
eye shall not look compassionately, and I will not spare; and if they
cry with a loud voice in my ears, I will not hear them. - After Ezekiel
has seen the idolatrous abominations in the outer court, or place for
the people, he is taken back into the inner court, or court of the
priests, to see still greater abominations there. Between the porch of
the temple and the altar of burnt-offering, the most sacred spot
therefore in the inner court, which the priests alone were permitted to
tread ([Joe 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017).md), he sees as if
twenty-five men, with their backs toward the temple, were worshipping
the sun in the east. כּ before עשׂרים is not a preposition, circa,
about, but a particle of comparison (an appearance): as if twenty-five
men; after the analogy of כּ before an accusative (vid., Ewald, 282d).
For the number here is not an approximative one; but twenty-five is the
exact number, namely, the twenty-four leaders of the classes of priests
([Ch1 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005.md).; [Ch2
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#014.md); [Ezr
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#005).md), with the high priest at the
head (see Lightfoot's Chronol. of O.T., Opp. I. 124). As the whole
nation was seen in the seventy elders, so is the entire priesthood
represented here in the twenty-five leaders as deeply sunk in
disgraceful idolatry. Their apostasy from the Lord is shown in the fact
that they turn their back upon the temple, and therefore upon Jehovah,
who was enthroned in the temple, and worship the sun, with their faces
turned towards the east. The worship of the sun does not refer to the
worship of Adonis, as Hvernick supposes, although Adonis was a sun-god;
but generally to the worship of the heavenly bodies, against which Moses
had warned the people ([Deu 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md); [Deu
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#003).md), and which found its way in the
time of Manasseh into the courts of the temple, whence it was afterwards
expelled by Josiah ([Kg2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005.md), [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011).md). The form משׁתתּויתם must be a
copyist's error for משׁתּחוים; as the supposition that it is an unusual
form, with a play upon השׁחית,

(Note: "An extraordinary form, invented for the purpose of more
effectually expressing their extraordinary abomination." - Lightfoot.)

is precluded by the fact that it would in that case be a 2nd per. plur.
perf., and such a construction is rendered impossible by the המּה which
immediately precedes it (cf. Ewald, 118a).

To these idolatrous abominations Judah has added other sins, as if these
abominations were not bad enough in themselves. This is the meaning of
the question in [Eze 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017.md), 'הנּקל וגו:
is it too little for the house of Judah, etc.? נקל with מן, as in [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006.md). To indicate the fulness of the
measure of guilt, reference is again briefly made to the moral
corruption of Judah. חמס embraces all the injuries inflicted upon men;
תּועבות, impiety towards God, i.e., idolatry. By violent deeds they
provoke God repeatedly to anger (שׁוּב, followed by an infinitive,
expresses the repetition of an action). The last clause of [Eze
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017) ('והנּם שׁלחים וגו.md) is very
obscure. The usual explanation, which has been adopted by J. D.
Michaelis and Gesenius: "they hold the twig to their nose," namely, the
sacred twig Barsom, which the Parsees held in their hands when praying
(vid., Hyde, de relig. vet. Pars. p. 350, ed. 2; and Kleuker,
Zend-Avesta, III. p. 204), suits neither the context nor the words.
According to the position of the clause in the context, we do not expect
an allusion to a new idolatrous rite, but an explanation of the way in
which Judah had excited the wrath of God by its violent deeds. Moreover,
זמורה is not a suitable word to apply to the Barsom - Zemōrâh is a shoot
or tendril of the vine (cf. [Eze 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002.md);
[Isa 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#010.md); [Num
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023).md). The Barsom, on the other hand,
consisted of bunches of twigs of the tree Gez or Hom, or of branches of
the pomegranate, the tamarisk, or the date (cf. Kleuker l.c., and
Strabo, XV. 733), and was not held to the nose, but kept in front of the
mouth as a magical mode of driving demons away (vid., Hyde, l.c.).
Lastly, שׁלח אל does not mean to hold anything, but to stretch out
towards, to prepare to strike, to use violence. Of the other
explanations given, only two deserve any consideration - namely, first,
the supposition that it is a proverbial expression, "to apply the twig
to anger," in the sense of adding fuel to the fire, which Doederlein (ad
Grotii adnott.) applies in this way, "by these things they supply food,
as it were, to my wrath, which burns against themselves," i.e., they
bring fuel to the fire of my wrath. Lightfoot gives a similar
explanation in his Hor. hebr. ad [Joh
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006.md). The second is that of Hitzig:
"they apply the sickle to their nose," i.e., by seeking to injure me,
they injure themselves. In this case זמורה must be taken in the sense of
מזמּרה, a sickle or pruning-knife, and pointed זמורה. The saying does
appear to be a proverbial one, but the origin and meaning of the proverb
have not yet been satisfactorily explained. - [Eze
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018.md). Therefore will the Lord punish
unsparingly (cf. [Eze 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#004.md), [Eze
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#009.md); [Eze
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#011).md). This judgment he shows to the
prophet in the two following chapters.
