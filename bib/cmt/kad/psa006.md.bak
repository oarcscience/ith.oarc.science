A Cry for Mercy under Judgement

The morning prayer, [Psa 5:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md), is
followed by a "Psalm of David," which, even if not composed in the
morning, looks back upon a sleepless, tearful night. It consists of
three strophes. In the middle one, which is a third longer than the
other two, the poet, by means of a calmer outpouring of his heart,
struggles on from the cry of distress in the first strophe to the
believing confidence of the last. The hostility of men seems to him as a
punishment of divine wrath, and consequently (but this is not so clearly
expressed as in Ps 38, which is its counterpart) as the result of his
sin; and this persecution, which to him has God's wrath behind it and
sin as the sting of its bitterness, makes him sorrowful and sick even
unto death. Because the Psalm contains no confession of sin, one might
be inclined to think that the church has wrongly reckoned it as the
first of the seven (probably selected with reference to the seven days
of the week) Psalmi paenitentiales ([Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md), [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), [Psa
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md), [Psa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md), [Psa
102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md), [Psa
130:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001.md), [Psa
143:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001).md). A. H. Francke in his
Introductio in Psalterium says, it is rather Psalmus precatorius hominis
gravissimi tentati a paenitente probe distinguendi. But this is a
mistake. The man who is tempted is distinguished from a penitent man by
this, that the feeling of wrath is with the one perfectly groundless and
with the other well-grounded. Job was one who was tempted thus. Our
psalmist, however, is a penitent, who accordingly seeks that the
punitive chastisement of God, as the just God, may for him be changed
into the loving chastisement of God, as the merciful One.

We recognise here the language of penitently believing prayer, which has
been coined by David. Compare [Psa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002.md)
with [Psa 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002.md); [Psa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003.md) with [Psa
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005.md); [Psa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md) with [Psa
109:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#026.md); [Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md) with [Psa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#010.md); [Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007.md) with [Psa
69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004.md); [Psa
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md) with [Psa
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010.md); [Psa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#010.md) with [Psa
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md), [Psa
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026.md). The language of Heman's Psalm
is perceptibly different, comp. [Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md) with [Psa
88:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md); [Psa
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md) with [Psa
88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md). And the corresponding strains
in Jeremiah (comp. [Psa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002.md), [Psa
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002.md) with [Jer
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024.md); [Psa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003.md) and [Psa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md) with [Jer
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014.md); [Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007.md) with [Jer
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#003).md) are echoes, which to us prove
that the Psalm belongs to an earlier age, not that it was composed by
the prophet (Hitzig). It is at once probable, from the almost
anthological relationship in which Jeremiah stands to the earlier
literature, that in the present instance also he is the reproducer. And
this idea is confirmed by the fact that in [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025.md), after language resembling the
Psalm before us, he continues in words taken from [Psa
79:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md). When Hitzig maintains that David
could no more have composed this disconcertedly despondent Psalm than
Isaiah could the words in [Isa 21:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003.md),
we refer, in answer to him, to [Isa
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004.md) and to the many attestations that
David did weep, [Sa2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#012.md); [Sa2
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#032.md); [Sa2
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#021.md); [Sa2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030.md); [Sa2
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001.md).

The accompanying musical direction runs: To the Precentor, with
accompaniment of stringed instruments, upon the Octave. The lxx
translates ὑπὲρ τῆς ὀγδόης, and the Fathers associate with it the
thought of the octave of eternal happiness, ἡ ὀγδόη ἐκείνη, as Gregory
of Nyssa says, ἥτίς ἐστιν ὁ ἐφεξῆς αἰών. But there is no doubt whatever
that על־השּׁמינית has reference to music. It is also found by [Psa
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md), and besides in [Ch1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021.md). From this latter passage it is
at least clear that it is not the name of an instrument. An instrument
with eight strings could not have been called an octave instead of an
octachord. In that passage they played upon nablas על־עלמות, and with
citherns על־השּׁמינית. If עלמות denotes maidens = maidens' voices i.e.,
soprano, then, as it seems, השּׁמינית is a designation of the bass, and
על־השׁמינית equivalent to all' ottava bassa. The fact that [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md), which is accompanied by the
direction על־עלמות, is a joyous song, whereas [Psa
6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md) is a plaintive one and [Psa
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md) not less gloomy and sad,
accords with this. These two were to be played in the lower octave, that
one in the higher.

[Psalms 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 6:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 6:2-4) There is a chastisement which proceeds from God's love to
the man as being pardoned and which is designed to purify or to prove
him, and a chastisement which proceeds from God's wrath against the man
as striving obstinately against, or as fallen away from, favour, and
which satisfies divine justice. [Psa
94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012.md); [Psa
118:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017.md); [Pro
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md). speak of this loving
chastisement. The man who should decline it, would act against his own
salvation. Accordingly David, like Jeremiah ([Jer
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024).md), does not pray for the removal
of the chastisement but of the chastisement in wrath, or what is the
same thing, of the judgment proceeding from wrath \[Zorngericht\].
בּאפּך and בּחמתך stand in the middle, between אל and the verbs, for the
sake of emphasis. Hengstenberg indeed finds a different antithesis here.
He says: "The contrast is not that of chastisement in love with
chastisement in wrath, but that of loving rescue in contrast with
chastisement, which always proceeds from the principle of wrath." If
what is here meant is, that always when God chastens a man his wrath is
the true and proper motive, it is an error, for the refutation of which
one whole book of the Bible, viz., the Book of Job, has been written.
For there the friends think that God is angry with Job; but we know from
the prologue that, so far from being angry with him, he on the contrary
glories in him. Here, in this Psalm, assuming David to be its author,
and his adultery the occasion of it, it is certainly quite otherwise.
The chastisement under which David is brought low, has God's wrath as
its motive: it is punitive chastisement and remains such, so long as
David remains fallen from favour. But if in sincere penitence he again
struggles through to favour, then the punitive becomes a loving
chastisement: God's relationship to him becomes an essentially different
relationship. The evil, which is the result of his sin and as such
indeed originates in the principle of wrath, becomes the means of
discipline and purifying which love employs, and this it is that he here
implores for himself. And thus Dante Alighieri

(Note: Provided he is the author of I stte Salmi Penitenziali
trasportati alla volgar poesia, vid., Dante Alighieri's Lyric poems,
translated and annotated by Kannegiesser and Witte (1842) i. 203f., ii.
208f.)

correctly and beautifully paraphrases the verse:

Signor, non mi riprender con furore,

E non voler correggermi con ira,

Ma con dolcezza e con perfetto amore.

In חנּני David prays God to let him experience His loving-kindness and
tender mercy in place of the punishment He has a right to inflict; for
anguish of soul has already reduced him to the extreme even of bodily
sickness: he is withered up and weary. אמלל has Pathach, and
consequently seems to be the 3 pers. Pul. as in [Joe
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010.md); [Nah
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004.md); but this cannot be according to
the rules of grammar. It is an adjective, like רענן, שׁאנן, with the
passive pointing. The formation אמלל (from אמל Arab. aml, with the
primary meaning to stretch out lengthwise) is analogous to the IX and XI
forms of the Arabic verb which serve especially to express colours and
defects (Caspari 59). The two words אני אמלל have the double accent
Mercha-Mahpach together, and according to the exact mode of writing
(vid., Baer in my Psalter ii. 492) the Mahpach, (the sign resembling
Mahpach or rather Jethib), ought to stand between the two words, since
it at the same time represents the Makkeph. The principal tone of the
united pair, therefore, lies on aani; and accordingly the adj. אמלל is
shortened to אמלל (cf. אדמדּם, הפכפּך, מרמס, and the like) - a
contraction which proves that אמלל is not treated as part. Pul. (=
מאמלל), for its characteristic a4 is unchangeable. The prayer for
healing is based upon the plea that his bones ([Job
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#014.md); [Isa
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#013).md) are affrighted. We have no
German word exactly corresponding to this נבהל which (from the radical
notion "to let go," cogn. בּלהּ) expresses a condition of outward
overthrow and inward consternation, and is therefore the effect of
fright which disconcerts one and of excitement that deprives one of
self-control.

(Note: We have translated Dr. Delitzsch's word erschrecht literally -
the vexed of the Authorized Version seems hardly equal to the meaning.)

His soul is still more shaken than his body. The affliction is therefore
not a merely bodily ailment in which only a timorous man loses heart.
God's love is hidden from him. God's wrath seems as though it would wear
him completely away. It is an affliction beyond all other afflictions.
Hence he enquires: And Thou, O Jahve, how long?! Instead of אתה it is
written את, which the Ker says is to be read אתּה, while in three
passages ([Num 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#015.md); [Deu
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#024.md); [Eze
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014).md) אתּ is admitted as masc.

[Psalms 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 6:4</span></span>

(Heb.: 6:5-8) God has turned away from him, hence the prayer שׁוּבה,
viz., אלי. The tone of שׁוּבה is on the ult., because it is assumed to
be read שׁוּבה אדני. The ultima accentuation is intended to secure its
distinct pronunciation to the final syllable of שׁובה, which is liable
to be drowned and escape notice in connection with the coming together
of the two aspirates (vid., on [Psa
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008).md). May God turn to him again,
rescue (חלּץ from חלץ, which is transitive in Hebr. and Aram., to free,
expedire, exuere, Arab. chalaṣa, to be pure, prop. to be loose, free)
his soul, in which his affliction has taken deep root, from this
affliction, and extend to him salvation on the ground of His mercy
towards sinners. He founds this cry for help upon his yearning to be
able still longer to praise God, - a happy employ, the possibility of
which would be cut off from him if he should die. זכר, as frequently
הזכּיר, is used of remembering one with reverence and honour; הודה (from
ודה) has the dat. honoris after it. שׁאול, [Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md), ἅδης ([Rev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013).md), alternates with מות. Such is
the name of the grave, the yawning abyss, into which everything mortal
descends (from שׁאל = שׁוּל Arab. sâl, to be loose, relaxed, to hang
down, sink down: a sinking in, that which is sunken in,

(Note: The form corresponds to the Arabic form fi‛âlun, which, though
originally a verbal abstract, has carried over the passive meaning into
the province of the concrete, e.g., kitâb = maktûb and ilâh, אלוהּ =
ma‛lûh = ma‛bûd (the feared, revered One).)

a depth). The writers of the Psalms all (which is no small objection
against Maccabean Psalms) know only of one single gathering-place of the
dead in the depth of the earth, where they indeed live, but it is only a
quasi life, because they are secluded from the light of this world and,
what is the most lamentable, from the light of God's presence. Hence the
Christian can only join in the prayer of v. 6 of this Psalm and similar
passages ([Psa 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#010.md); [Psa
88:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md); [Psa
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017.md); [Isa
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018)..md) so far as he transfers the
notion of hades to that of gehenna.

(Note: An adumbration of this relationship of Christianity to the
religion of the Old Testament is the relationship of Islam to the
religion of the Arab wandering tribes, which is called the "religion of
Abraham" (Din Ibrâhim), and knows no life after death; while Islam has
taken from the later Judaism and from Christianity the hope of a
resurrection and heavenly blessedness.)

In hell there is really no remembrance and no praising of God. David's
fear of death as something in itself unhappy, is also, according to its
ultimate ground, nothing but the fear of an unhappy death. In these
"pains of hell" he is wearied with (בּ as in [Psa
69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004).md) groaning, and bedews his couch
every night with a river of tears. Just as the Hiph. השׂחה signifies to
cause to swim from שׂחה to swim, so the Hiph. המסה signifies to
dissolve, cause to melt, from מסה (cogn. מסס) to melt. דּמעה, in Arabic
a nom. unit. a tear, is in Hebrew a flood of tears.

In [Psa 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md) עיני does not signify my
"appearance" ([Num 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#007).md), but, as
becomes clear from [Psa 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010.md); [Psa
88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md), [Job
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#007.md), "my eye;" the eye reflects the
whole state of a man's health. The verb עשׁשׁ appears to be a
denominative from עשׁ: to be moth-eaten.

(Note: Reuchlin in his grammatical analysis of the seven Penitential
Psalms, which he published in 1512 after his Ll. III de Rudimentis
Hebraicis (1506), explains it thus: עשׁשׁה Verminavit. Sic a vermibus
dictum qui turbant res claras puras et nitidas, and in the Rudim. p.
412: Turbatus est a furore oculus meus, corrosus et obfuscatus, quasi
vitro laternae obductus.)

The signification senescere for the verb עתק is more certain. The
closing words בּכל־צוררי (cf. [Num
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009.md) הצּר הצּרר the oppressing
oppressor, from the root צר Arab. tsr, to press, squeeze, and especially
to bind together, constringere, coartare

(Note: In Arabic ציר dir is the word for a step-mother as the oppressor
of the step-children; and צרר dirr, a concubine as the oppressor of her
rival.)),

in which the writer indicates, partially at least, the cause of his
grief (כּעס, in [Job 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#007) כּעשׁ.md), are
as it were the socket into which the following strophe is inserted.

[Psalms 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 6:8</span></span>

(Heb.: 6:9-11) Even before his plaintive prayer is ended the divine
light and comfort come quickly into his heart, as Frisch says in his
"Neuklingende Harfe Davids." His enemies mock him as one forsaken of
God, but even in the face of his enemies he becomes conscious that this
is not his condition. Thrice in [Psa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#009.md), [Psa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#010.md) his confidence that God will
answer him flashes forth: He hears his loud sobbing, the voice of his
weeping that rises towards heaven, He hears his supplication, and He
graciously accepts his prayer. The twofold שׁמע expresses the fact and
יקח its consequence. That which he seems to have to suffer, shall in
reality be the lot of his enemies, viz., the end of those who are
rejected of God: they shall be put to shame. The בּושׁ, Syr. behet,
Chald. בּהת, בּהת, which we meet with here for the first time, is not
connected with the Arab. bht, but (since the Old Arabic as a rule has
t\` as a mediating vowel between ש and t, )ת with Arab. bât, which
signifies "to turn up and scatter about things that lie together (either
beside or upon each other)" eruere et diruere, disturbare, - a root
which also appears in the reduplicated form Arab. bṯṯ: to root up and
disperse, whence Arab. battun, sorrow and anxiety, according to which
therefore בּושׁ (= בּושׁ as Arab. bâta = bawata) prop. signifies
disturbare, to be perplexed, lose one's self-control, and denotes shame
according to a similar, but somewhat differently applied conception to
confundi, συγχεῖσθαι, συγχύνεσθαι. ויבּהלוּ points back to [Psa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002.md), [Psa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003.md) : the lot at which the malicious
have rejoiced, shall come upon themselves. As is implied in יבשׁוּ
ישׁבוּ, a higher power turns back the assailants filled with shame ([Psa
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#004.md); [Psa
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004).md).

What an impressive finish we have here in these three Milels, jashûbu
jebôshu rāga), in relation to the tripping measure of the preceding
words addressed to his enemies! And, if not intentional, yet how
remarkable is the coincidence, that shame follows the involuntary
reverse of the foes, and that יבשׁו in its letters and sound is the
reverse of ישׁבו! What music there is in the Psalter! If composers could
but understand it!!
