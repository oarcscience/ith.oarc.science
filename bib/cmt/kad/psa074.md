Appeal to God against Religious Persecution, in Which the Temple Is
Violated

The מזמור 73 is here followed by a Maskı̂l (vid., [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001).md) which, in common with the
former, has the prominent, rare word משּׁוּאות ([Psa
74:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#003.md); [Psa
73:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018).md), but also the old Asaphic
impress. We here meet with the favourite Asaphic contemplation of Israel
as a flock, and the predilection of the Asaphic Psalms for retrospective
references to Israel's early history ([Psa
74:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013).md). We also find the former of
these two characteristic features in [Psa
79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md), which reflects the same
circumstances of the times. Moreover Jeremiah stands in the same
relationship to both Psalms. In [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025.md); [Psa
79:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md). is repeated almost word for
word. And one is reminded of Psalms 74 by [Lam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002.md) (cf. [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007).md), [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md) (cf. [Psa
74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004).md), and other passages. The lament
"there is no prophet any more" ([Psa
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009).md) sounds very much like [Lam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009.md). In connection with Jeremiah's
reproductive manner, and his habit of allowing himself to be prompted to
new thoughts by the original passages by means of the association of
ideas (cf. כּיום מועד, [Lam 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md), with
בּקרב מועדך of the Psalm), it is natural to assign the priority in age
to the two Asaphic national lamentation Psalms.

But the substance of both Psalms, which apparently brings us down not
merely into the Chaldaean, but even into the Maccabaean age, rises up in
opposition to it. After his return from the second Egyptian expedition
(170 b.c.) Antiochus Epiphanes chastised Jerusalem, which had been led
into revolt by Jason, in the most cruel manner, entered the Temple
accompanied by the court high priest Menalaus, and carried away the most
costly vessels, and even the gold of the walls and doors, with him.
Myriads of the Jews were at that time massacred or sold as slaves. Then
during the fourth Egyptian expedition (168) of Antiochus, when a party
favourably disposed towards the Ptolemies again arose in Jerusalem, he
sent Apollonius to punish the offenders (167), and his troops laid the
city waste with fire and sword, destroyed houses and walls, burnt down
several of the Temple-gates and razed many of its apartments. Also on
this occasion thousands were slain and led away captive. Then began the
attempt of Antiochus to Hellenize the Jewish nation. An aged Athenian
was entrusted with the carrying out of this measure. Force was used to
compel the Jews to accept the heathen religion, and in fact to serve
Olympian Zeus (Jupiter): on the 15th of Chislev a smaller altar was
erected upon the altar of burnt-offering in the Temple, and on the 25th
of Chislev the first sacrifice was offered to Olympian Zeus in the
Temple of Jahve, now dedicated to him. Such was the position of affairs
when a band of faithful confessors rallied around the Asmonaean
(Hasmonaean) priest Mattathias.

How strikingly does much in both Psalms, more particularly in Ps 74,
harmonize with this position of affairs! At that time it was felt more
painfully than ever that prophecy had become dumb, 1 Macc. 4:46; 9:27;
14:41. The confessors and martyrs who bravely declared themselves were
called, as in [Psa 79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002.md), חסידים,
Ἀσιδαῖοι. At that time "they saw," as 1 Macc. 4:38 says, "the sanctuary
desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burnt up, and shrubs
growing in the courts as in a forest, or as in one of the mountains,
yea, and the priests' chambers pulled down." the doors of the
Temple-gates were burned to ashes (cf. 2 Macc. 8:33; 1:8). The religious
אותות ([Psa 74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004).md) of the heathen
filled the place where Jahve was wont to reveal Himself. Upon the altar
of the court stood the βδέλυγμα ἐρημώσεως; in the courts they had
planted trees, and likewise the "signs" of heathendom; and the לשׁכות
(παστοφόρια) lay in ruins. When later on, under Demetrius Stoer (161),
Alcimus (an apostate whom Antiochus had appointed high priest) and
Bacchides advanced with promises of peace, but with an army at the same
time, a band of scribes, the foremost of the Asidai'oi of Israel, went
forth to meet them to intercede for their nation. Alcimus, however,
seized sixty of them, slaughtered them in one day, and that, as it is
added in 1 Macc. 7:16f., "according to the word which he wrote: The
flesh of Thy saints and their blood have they shed round about
Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them." The formula of citation
κατὰ τὸν λόγον ὃν (τοὺς λόγου οὓς) ἔγραψε, and more particularly the
ἔγραψε - which as being the aorist cannot have the Scripture (ἡ γραφή),
and, since the citation is a prayer to god, not God, but only the
anonymous psalmist, as its subject (vid., however, the various readings
in Grimm on this passage) - sounds as though the historian were himself
conscious that he was quoting a portion of Scripture that had taken its
rise among the calamities of that time. In fact, no age could be
regarded as better warranted in incorporating some of its songs in the
Psalter than the Maccabaean, the sixty-third week predicted by Daniel,
the week of suffering bearing in itself the character of the time of the
end, this strictly martyr age of the Old Covenant, to which the Book of
Daniel awards a high typical significance in relation to the history of
redemption.

But unbiassed as we are in the presence of the question whether there
are Maccabaean Psalms, still there is, on the other hand, much, too,
that is against the referring of the two Psalms to the Maccabaean age.
In [Psa 79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md) there is nothing that
militates against referring it to the Chaldaean age, and [Psa
79:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#011.md) (cf. [Psa
102:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021.md); [Psa
69:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#034).md) is even favourable to this. And
in Psalms 74, in which [Psa 74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004.md), [Psa
74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008.md), [Psa
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md) are the most satisfactorily
explained from the Maccabaean age, there are, again, other parts which
are better explained from the Chaldaean. For what is said in [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md), "they have set Thy Temple on
fire," applies just as unconditionally as it runs to the Chaldaeans, but
not to the Syrians. And the cry of prayer, [Psa
74:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#003.md), "lift up Thy footsteps to the
eternal ruins," appears to assume a laying waste that has taken place
within the last few years at least, such as the Maccabaean age cannot
exhibit, although at the exaltation of the Maccabees Jerusalem was
ἀοίκητος ὡς ἔρημος (1 Macc. 3:45). Hitzig, it is true, renders: raise
Thy footsteps for sudden attacks without end; but both the passages in
which משּׁוּאות occurs mutually secure to this word the signification
"desolations" (Targum, Symmachus, Jerome, and Saadia). If, however, the
Chaldaean catastrophe were meant, then the author of both Psalms, on the
ground of [Ezr 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#041.md); [Neh
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#044.md) (cf. [Neh
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022).md), might be regarded as an
Asaphite of the time of the Exile, although they might also be composed
by any one in the Asaphic style. And as regards their relation to
Jeremiah, we ought to be contented with the fact that Jeremiah, whose
peculiarity as a writer is otherwise so thoroughly reproductive, is,
notwithstanding, also reproduced by later writers, and in this instance
by the psalmist.

Nothing is more certain than that the physiognomy of these Psalms does
not correspond to any national misfortune prior to the Chaldaean
catastrophe. Vaihinger's attempt to comprehend them from the time of
Athaliah's reign of terror, is at issue with itself. In the history of
Israel instances of the sacking of Jerusalem and of the Temple are not
unknown even prior to the time of Zedekiah, as in the reign of Jehoram,
but there is no instance of the city being reduced to ashes. Since even
the profanation of the Temple by the Persian general Bagoses (Josephus,
Ant. xi. 7), to which Ewald formerly referred this Psalm, was not
accompanied by any injury of the building itself, much less its
reduction to ashes, there remains only the choice between the laying
waste of Jerusalem and of the Temple in the year 588 and in the year
167. We have reserved to ourselves the liberty of acknowledging some
insertions from the time of the Maccabees in the Psalter; supra, pp.
6-8. Now since in both Psalms, apart from the משׁאות נצח, everything
accords with the Maccabaean age, whilst when we refer them to the
Chaldaean period the scientific conscience is oppressed by many
difficulties (more especially in connection with [Psa
74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004.md), [Psa
74:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008.md); [Psa
79:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002).md), we yield to the force of the
impression and base both Psalms upon the situation of the Jewish nation
under Antiochus and Demetrius. Their contents coincide with the prayer
of Judas Maccabaeus in 2 Macc. 8:1-4.

[Psalms 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 74:1</span></span>

The poet begins with the earnest prayer that God would again have
compassion upon His church, upon which His judgment of anger has fallen,
and would again set up the ruins of Zion. Why for ever ([Psa
74:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#010.md), [Psa
79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005.md); [Psa
89:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047.md), cf. [Psa
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002).md)? is equivalent to, why so
continually and, as it seems, without end? The preterite denotes the act
of casting off, the future, [Psa 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md),
that lasting condition of this casting off. למה, when the initial of the
following word is a guttural, and particularly if it has a merely
half-vowel (although in other instances also, [Gen
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#019.md); [Gen
27:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#045.md); [Sol
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007).md), is deprived of its Dagesh and
accented on the ultima, in order (as Mose ha-Nakdan expressly observes)
to guard against the swallowing up of the ah; cf. on [Psa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md). Concerning the smoking of anger,
vid., [Psa 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md). The
characteristically Asaphic expression צאן מרעיתו is not less Jeremianic,
[Jer 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md). In [Psa
74:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002.md) God is reminded of what He has
once done for the congregation of His people. קדם, as in [Psa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002.md), points back into the Mosaic time
of old, to the redemption out of Egypt, which is represented in קנה
([Exo 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017).md) as a purchasing, and in
גאל ([Psa 77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015.md); [Psa
78:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#035.md), [Exo
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#013)) as a ransoming (redemptio.md).
שׁבט נחלתך is a factitive object; שׁבט is the name given to the whole
nation in its distinctness of race from other peoples, as in [Jer
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#016.md); [Jer
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#019.md), cf. [Isa
63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017.md). זה ([Psa
74:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002).md) is rightly separated from
הר־ציון (Mugrash); it stands directly for אשׁר, as in [Psa
104:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#008.md), [Psa
104:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026.md); [Pro
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#022.md); [Job
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#017) (Ges. 122, 2.md). The congregation
of the people and its central abode are, as though forgotten of God, in
a condition which sadly contrasts with their election. משּׁאות נצח are
ruins (vid., [Psa 73:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018).md) in a state of
such total destruction, that all hope of their restoration vanishes
before it; נצח here looks forward, just as עולם (חרבות), [Isa
63:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012.md); [Psa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md), looks backwards. May God then
lift His feet up high (פּעמים poetical for רגלים, cf. [Psa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#011.md) with [Psa
68:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#024).md), i.e., with long hurried steps,
without stopping, move towards His dwelling - lace that now lies in
ruins, that by virtue of His interposition it may rise again. Hath the
enemy made merciless havoc - he hath ill-treated (הרע, as in [Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003).md) everything (כּל, as in [Psa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#007.md), [Zep
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#002), for חכּל or את־כּל.md) in the
sanctuary - how is it possible that this sacrilegious vandalism should
remain unpunished!

[Psalms 74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 74:4</span></span>

The poet now more minutely describes how the enemy has gone on. Since
קדשׁ in [Psa 74:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#003.md) is the Temple,
מועדיך in [Psa 74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004.md) ought likewise to
mean the Temple with reference to the several courts; but the plural
would here (cf. [Psa 74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008).md) be
misleading, and is, too, only a various reading. Baer has rightly
decided in favour of מועדך;

(Note: The reading מעודיך is received, e.g., by Elias Hutter and Nissel;
the Targum translates it, Kimchi follows it in his interpretation, and
Abraham of Zante follows it in his paraphrase; it is tolerably widely
known, but, according to the lxx and Syriac versions and MSS, it is to
be rejected.)

מועד, as in [Lam 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md)., is the
instituted ([Num 17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001) :19 \[4\].md)
place of God's intercourse with His congregation (cf. Arab. mı̂‛âd, a
rendezvous). What Jeremiah says in [Lam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md) (cf. שׁאג, [Jer
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#015).md) is here more briefly expressed.
By אותתם ([Psa 74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004).md) we must not
understand military insignia; the scene of the Temple and the
supplanting of the Israelitish national insignia to be found there, by
the substitution of other insignia, requires that the word should have
the religious reference in which it is used of circumcision and of the
Sabbath ([Exo 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013).md); such heathen
אתות, which were thrust upon the Temple and the congregation of Jahve as
henceforth the lawful ones, were those which are set forth in 1 Macc.
1:45-49, and more particularly the so-called abomination of desolation
mentioned in v. 54 of the same chapter. With יוּדע ([Psa
74:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005).md) the terrible scene which was at
that time taking place before their eyes ([Psa
79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010).md) is introduced. כּמביא is the
subject; it became visible, tangible, noticeable, i.e., it looked, and
one experienced it, as if a man caused the axe to enter into the thicket
of the wood, i.e., struck into or at it right and left. The plural
קדּמּות forces itself into the simile because it is the many heathen
warriors who are, as in [Jer 46:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#022.md).,
likened to these hewers of wood. Norzi calls the Kametz of בסבך־עץ
Kametz chatuph; the combining form would then be a contraction of סבך
(Ewald, Olshausen), for the long ā of סבך does not admit of any
contraction. According to another view it is to be read bi-sbāch-etz, as
in [Est 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#008.md) kethāb-hadāth with
counter-tone Metheg beside the long vowel, as e.g., עץ־הגּן, [Gen
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#016).md). The poet follows the work of
destruction up to the destroying stroke, which is introduced by the ועת
(perhaps ועת, Ker ועתּה), which arrests one's attention. In [Psa
74:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005.md) the usual, unbroken quiet is
depicted, as is the heavy Cyclopean labour in the Virgilian illi inter
sese, etc.; in jahalomûn, [Psa 74:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#006.md)
(now and then pointed jahlomûn), we hear the stroke of the uplifted
axes, which break in pieces the costly carved work of the Temple. The
suffix of פּתּוּחיה (the carved works thereof) refers, according to the
sense, to מועדך. The lxx, favouring the Maccabaean interpretation,
renders: ἐξέκοψαν τάς θύρας αὐτῆς (פּתחיה). This shattering of the
panelling is followed in [Psa 74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md) by
the burning, first of all, as we may suppose, of this panelling itself
so far as it consists of wood. The guaranteed reading here is מקדשׁך,
not מקדשׁיך. שׁלּח בּאשׁ signifies to set on fire, immittere igni,
differing from שׁלּח אשׁ בּ, to set fire to, immittere ignem. On לארץ
חלּלוּ, cf. [Lam 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002.md); [Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md). Hitzig, following the lxx,
Targum, and Jerome, derives the exclamation of the enemies נינם from
נין: their whole generation (viz., we will root out)! But נין is
posterity, descendants; why therefore only the young and not the aged?
And why is it an expression of the object and not rather of the action,
the object of which would be self-evident? נינם is fut. Kal of ינה, here
= Hiph. הונה, to force, oppress, tyrannize over, and like אנס, to compel
by violence, in later Hebrew. נינם (from יינה, like ייפה) is changed in
pause into נינם; cf. the future forms in [Num
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030.md); [Exo
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#019.md), and also in [Psa
118:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md). Now, after mention has been
made of the burning of the Temple framework, מועדי־אל cannot denote the
place of the divine manifestation after its divisions (Hengstenberg),
still less the festive assemblies (Bttcher), which the enemy could only
have burnt up by setting fire to the Temple over their heads, and כל
does not at all suit this. The expression apparently has reference to
synagogues (and this ought not to be disputed), as Aquila and Symmachus
render the word. For there is no room for thinking of the separate
services conducted by the prophets in the northern kingdom ([Kg2
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023).md), because this kingdom no longer
existed at the time this Psalm was written; nor of the בּמות, the
burning down of which no pious Israelite would have bewailed; nor of the
sacred places memorable from the early history of Israel, which are
nowhere called מועדים, and after the founding of the central sanctuary
appear only as the seats of false religious rites. The expression points
(like בּית ועד, Sota ix. 15) to places of assembly for religious
purposes, to houses for prayer and teaching, that is to say, to
synagogues - a weighty instance in favour of the Maccabaean origin of
the Psalm.

[Psalms 74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 74:9</span></span>

The worst thing the poet has to complain of is that God has not
acknowledged His people during this time of suffering as at other times.
"Our signs" is the direct antithesis to "their sings" ([Psa
74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004).md), hence they are not to be
understood, after [Psa 86:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#017.md), as signs
which God works. The suffix demands, besides, something of a perpetual
character; they are the instituted ordinances of divine worship by means
of which God is pleased to stand in fellowship with His people, and
which are now no longer to be seen because the enemies have set them
aside. The complaint "there is not prophet any more" would seem strange
in the period immediately after the destruction of Jerusalem, for
Jeremiah's term of active service lasted beyond this. Moreover, a year
before (in the tenth year of Zedekiah's reign) he had predicted that the
Babylonian domination, and relatively the Exile, would last seventy
years; besides, six years before the destruction Ezekiel appeared, who
was in communication with those who remained behind in the land. The
reference to [Lam 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009.md) (cf. [Eze
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026).md) does not satisfy one; for there
it is assumed that there were prophets, a fact which is here denied.
Only perhaps as a voice coming out of the Exile, the middle of which
(cf. [Hos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md); [Ch2
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003.md), and besides Canticum trium
puerorum, [Psa 74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md) : καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν
ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ ἄρχων καὶ προφήτης καὶ ἡγούμενος) was truly thus
devoid of signs or miracles, and devoid of the prophetic word of
consolation, can [Psa 74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md) be
comprehended. The seventy years of Jeremiah were then still a riddle
without any generally known solution (Dan. 9). If, however, synagogues
are meant in [Psa 74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008.md), [Psa
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md) now too accords with the
like-sounding lament in the calamitous times of Antiochus (1 Macc. 4:46;
9:27; 14:41). In [Psa 74:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#010.md) the poet
turns to God Himself with the question "How long?" how long is this
(apparently) endless blaspheming of the enemy to last? Why dost Thou
draw back (viz., ממּנוּ, from us, not עלינוּ, [Psa
81:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#015).md) Thy hand and Thy right hand?
The conjunction of synonyms "Thy hand and Thy right hand" is, as in [Psa
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md), Sirach 33:7, a fuller expression
for God's omnipotent energy. This is now at rest; [Psa
74:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#011.md) calls upon it to give help by an
act of judgment. "Out of the midst of Thy bosom, destroy," is a pregnant
expression for, "drawing forth out of Thy bosom the hand that rests
inactive there, do Thou destroy." The Chethb חוקך has perhaps the same
meaning; for חוק, Arab. ḥawq, signifies, like חיק, Arab. ḥayq, the act
of encompassing, then that which encompasses. Instead of מחיקך ([Exo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#007).md) the expression is מקּרב חיקך,
because there, within the realm of the bosom, the punitive justice of
God for a time as it were slumbers. On the כלּה, which outwardly is
without any object, cf. [Psa 59:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014.md).

[Psalms 74:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 74:12</span></span>

With this prayer for the destruction of the enemies by God's
interposition closes the first half of the Psalm, which has for its
subject-matter the crying contradiction between the present state of
things and God's relationship to Israel. The poet now draws comfort by
looking back into the time when God as Israel's King unfolded the rich
fulness of His salvation everywhere upon the earth, where Israel's
existence was imperilled. בּקרב הארץ, not only within the circumference
of the Holy Land, but, e.g., also within that of Egypt ([Exo
8:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018).md). The poet has Egypt directly
in his mind, for there now follows first of all a glance at the
historical ([Psa 74:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013).md), and then
at the natural displays of God's power ([Psa
74:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#016.md), [Psa
74:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#017).md). Hengstenberg is of opinion
that [Psa 74:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013.md) also are to be
understood in the latter sense, and appeals to [Job
26:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#011.md). But just as Isaiah ([Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md), cf. [Psa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001).md) transfers these emblems of the
omnipotence of God in the natural world to His proofs of power in
connection with the history of redemption which were exhibited in the
case of a worldly power, so does the poet here also in [Psa
74:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013.md). The תּנּיּן (the extended
saurian) is in Isaiah, as in Ezekiel (התּנּים, [Psa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md); [Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002).md), an emblem of Pharaoh and of his
kingdom; in like manner here the leviathan is the proper natural wonder
of Egypt. As a water-snake or a crocodile, when it comes up with its
head above the water, is killed by a powerful stroke, did God break the
heads of the Egyptians, so that the sea cast up their dead bodies ([Exo
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030).md). The ציּים, the dwellers in the
steppe, to whom these became food, are not the Aethiopians (lxx,
Jerome), or rather the Ichthyophagi (Bocahrt, Hengstenberg), who
according to Agatharcides fed ἐκ τῶν ἐκριπτομένων εἰς τὴν χέρσον κητῶν,
but were no cannibals, but the wild beasts of the desert, which are
called עם, as in [Pro 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#025.md). the ants
and the rock-badgers. לציים is a permutative of the notion לעם, which
was not completed: to a (singular) people, viz., to the wild animals of
the steppe. [Psa 74:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015.md) also still
refers not to miracles of creation, but to miracles wrought in the
course of the history of redemption; [Psa
74:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015.md) refers to the giving of water
out of the rock ([Psa 78:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#015).md), and [Psa
74:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015.md) to the passage through the
Jordan, which was miraculously dried up (הובשׁתּ, as in [Jos
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#010.md); [Jos
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#023.md); [Jos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001).md). The object מעין ונחל is intended
as referring to the result: so that the water flowed out of the cleft
after the manner of a fountain and a brook. נהרות are the several
streams of the one Jordan; the attributive genitive איתן describe them
as streams having an abundance that does not dry up, streams of
perennial fulness. The God of Israel who has thus marvellously made
Himself known in history is, however, the Creator and Lord of all
created things. Day and night and the stars alike are His creatures. In
close connection with the night, which is mentioned second, the moon,
the מאור of the night, precedes the sun; cf. [Psa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004.md), where כּונן is the same as הכין
in this passage. It is an error to render thus: bodies of light, and
more particularly the sun; which would have made one expect מאורות
before the specializing Waw. גּבוּלות are not merely the bounds of the
land towards the sea, [Jer 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022.md), but,
according to [Deu 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md); [Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026.md), even the boundaries of the land
in themselves, that is to say, the natural boundaries of the inland
country. קיץ וחרף are the two halves of the year: summer including
spring (אביב), which begins in Nisan, the spring-month, about the time
of the vernal equinox, and autumn including winter (צתו), after the
termination of which the strictly spring vegetation begins ([Sol
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011).md). The seasons are personified,
and are called God's formations or works, as it were the angels of
summer and of winter.

[Psalms 74:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 74:18</span></span>

The poet, after he has thus consoled himself by the contemplation of the
power of God which He has displayed for His people's good as their
Redeemer, and for the good of the whole of mankind as the Creator, rises
anew to prayer, but all the more cheerfully and boldly. Since ever
present facts of creation have been referred to just now, and the
historical mighty deeds of God only further back, זאת refers rather
forwards to the blaspheming of the enemies which He suffers now to go on
unpunished, as though He took no cognizance of it. חרף has Pasek after
it in order to separate the word, which signifies reviling, from the
most holy Name. The epithet עם־נבל reminds one of [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md). In [Psa
74:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019.md) according to the accents חיּת is
the absolute state (the primary form of חיּה, vid., on [Psa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001).md): give not over, abandon not to
the wild beast (beasts), the soul of Thy turtle-dove. This is probably
correct, since לחיּת נפשׁ, "to the eager wild beast," this inversion of
the well-known expression נפשׁ חיּה, which on the contrary yields the
sense of vita animae, is an improbable and exampleless expression. If
נפשׁ were intended to be thus understood, the poet might have written
אל־תתן לנפשׁ חיּה תורך, "give not Thy turtle-dove over to the desire of
the wild beast." Hupfeld thinks that the "old, stupid reading" may be
set right at one stroke, inasmuch as he reads אל תתן לנפש חית תורך, and
renders it "give not to rage the life Thy turtle-dove;" but where is any
support to be found for this לנפשׁ, "to rage," or rather (Psychology, S.
202; tr. p. 239) "to eager desire?" The word cannot signify this in such
an isolated position. Israel, which is also compared to a dove in [Psa
68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014), is called a turtle-dove (תּור.md).
In [Psa 74:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019.md) חיּת has the same
signification as in [Psa 74:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019.md), and
the same sense as [Psa 68:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011.md) (cf. Ps
69:37): the creatures of Thy miserable ones, i.e., Thy poor, miserable
creatures - a figurative designation of the ecclesia pressa. The church,
which it is the custom of the Asaphic Psalms to designate with
emblematical names taken from the animal world, finds itself now like
sheep among wolves, and seems to itself as if it were forgotten by God.
The cry of prayer הבּט לבּרית comes forth out of circumstances such as
were those of the Maccabaean age. בּרית is the covenant of circumcision
(Gen. 17); the persecution of the age of the Seleucidae put faith to the
severe test, that circumcision, this sign which was the pledge to Israel
of God's gracious protection, became just the sign by which the Syrians
knew their victims. In the Book of Daniel, [Dan
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028.md), [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md), cf. Ps. 22:32, ברית is used
directly of the religion of Israel and its band of confessors. The
confirmatory clause [Psa 74:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#020.md) also
corresponds to the Maccabaean age, when the persecuted confessors hid
themselves far away in the mountains (1 Macc. 2:26ff., 2 Macc. 6:11),
but were tracked by the enemy and slain, - at that time the
hiding-places (κρύφοι, 1 Macc. 1:53) of the land were in reality full of
the habitations of violence. The combination נאות חמס is like נאות
השׁלום, [Jer 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#037.md), cf. [Gen
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011.md). From this point the Psalm draws
to a close in more familiar Psalm - strains. אל־ישׁב, [Psa
74:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#021.md), viz., from drawing near to Thee
with their supplications. "The reproach of the foolish all the day" is
that which incessantly goes forth from them. עלה תּמיד, "going up ([Sa1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#012.md), not: increasing, [Kg1
22:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#035).md) perpetually," although without
the article, is not a predicate, but attributive (vid., on [Psa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003).md). The tone of the prayer is
throughout temperate; this the ground upon which it bases itself is
therefore all the more forcible.
