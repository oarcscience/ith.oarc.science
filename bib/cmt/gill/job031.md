INTRODUCTION TO JOB 31

In this chapter Job gives an account of himself in private life, of the
integrity and uprightness of his life, and his holy walk and
conversation, with this view, that it might be thought that the
afflictions which were upon him were not on account of a vicious course
of life he had indulged unto, as was suggested; and he clears himself
from various crimes which it might be insinuated he was guilty of, as
from unchastity; and he observes the method he took to prevent his
falling into it, and the reasons that dissuaded him from it, [Job
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#001.md); from injustice in his dealings
with men, [Job 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#005.md); from the sin of
adultery, [Job 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#009.md); from ill usage of
his servants, [Job 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013.md); from
unkindness to the poor, which he enlarges upon, and gives many instances
of his charity to them, [Job 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#016.md);
from covetousness, and a vain confidence in wealth, [Job
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024.md); from idolatry, the worship of
the sun and moon, [Job 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md); from a
revengeful spirit, [Job 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#029.md); and
from inhospitality to strangers, [Job
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#032.md); from covering his sin, [Job
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#033.md); and fear of men, [Job
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#034.md); and then wishes his cause might
be heard before God, [Job 31:35](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#035.md); and
the chapter is closed with an imprecation on his head if guilty of any
injustice, [Job 31:38](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#038.md).

[Job 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 31:1</span></span>

I made a covenant with mine eyes,.... Not to look upon a woman, and
wantonly gaze at her beauty, lest his heart should be drawn thereby to
lust after her; for the eyes are inlets to many sins, and particularly
to uncleanness, of which there have been instances, both in bad men and
good men, [Gen 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002); so the poet (t.md)
represents the eye as the way through which the beauty of a woman passes
swifter than an arrow into the hearts of men, and makes impressions
there; see [Pe2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md); hence Zaleucus
ordered adulterers to be punished, by plucking out the eyes of the
adulterer (u); wherefore Job, to prevent this, entered into a solemn
engagement with himself, laid himself under a strong obligation, as if
he had bound himself by a covenant, made a resolution in the strength of
divine grace, not to employ his eyes in looking on objects that might
ensnare his heart, and lead him to the commission of sin; he made use of
all ways and means, and took every precaution to guard against it; and
particularly this, to shut or turn his eyes from beholding what might be
alluring and enticing to him: it is said (x) of Democritus, that he put
out his eyes because he could not look upon a woman without lusting
after her:

why then should I think upon a maid; of corrupting and defiling her,
since he had made a covenant with his eyes, and this would be a breach
of that covenant: and therefore, besides the sin of lusting after her,
or of corrupting her, he would be a covenant breaker, and so his sin
would be an aggravated one: or he made a covenant with his eyes, to
prevent any impure thoughts, desires, and inclinations in him; for the
eye affects the heart, and stirs up lust in it, and excites unclean
thoughts and unchaste desires: this shows that the thought of sin is
sin; that fornication was reckoned a sin before the law of Moses; and
that Job better understood the spirituality of the law than the
Pharisees did in the time of Christ, and had the same notion of lust in
the heart being fornication and adultery as he had; and that good men
are not without temptation to sin, both from within and from without;
and therefore should carefully shun all appearances of evil, and
whatsoever leads unto it, and take every necessary precaution to guard
against it.

[Job 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 31:2</span></span>

For what portion of God is there from above?.... What good portion, as
the Targum paraphrases it, can impure persons expect from God? such who
indulge themselves, and live in the sin of uncleanness, cannot hope to
have any part in God, or a portion of good things from him; he is above,
and in the highest heavens, and every good thing comes from thence, and
from him there; and particularly the spiritual blessings, wherewith he
blesses his people, are in heavenly places in Christ, and from thence
come to them; and here a special respect may be had to God himself, who
is the portion of his people, both in life and at death, and to all
eternity; but men that live a vicious course of life cannot conclude
they have any part in God and Christ, nor in the grace of God, and the
blessings of it, nor enjoy communion with him:

and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? heaven is an
inheritance which belongs to the children of God, and he, as their
heavenly Father, has bequeathed it unto then; this is from the almighty
God, God all sufficient; he has chosen this inheritance for them, and
appointed them unto it; this is laid up by him and reserved in heaven
for them; and he gives both a right unto it, and a meetness for it, and
will put them into the possession of it: but then impure persons, as
fornicators and adulterers, have no inheritance in the kingdom of God
and of Christ, [Eph 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md); and this was
a reason with Job, and what had an influence on him, to be careful to
avoid the sin of uncleanness. Some understand the words as a question
concerning what would be the portion and heritage of a wicked man, a
corrupter of virgins; the answer to which is given in the next verse,
destruction and a strange punishment; this is their portion from God,
and the heritage appointed to them by him; see [Job
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029.md).

[Job 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 31:3</span></span>

Is not destruction to the wicked?.... It is even to such wicked men, who
live in the sin of fornication, and make it their business to ensnare
and corrupt virgins; and which is another reason why Job was careful to
avoid that sin; wickedness of every sort is the cause of destruction,
destruction and misery are in the ways of wicked men, and their wicked
ways lead unto it, and issue in it, even destruction of soul and body in
hell, which is swift and sudden, and will be everlasting: this is laid
up for wicked men among the treasures of God's wrath, and they are
reserved that, and there is no way of deliverance from it but by Christ:

and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity; the iniquity of
fornication and whoredom, [Pro 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#020.md);
who make it their business to commit it, and live in a continued course
of uncleanness and other sins; a punishment, something strange, unusual,
and uncommon, as the filthy venereal disease in this world, and
everlasting burnings in another; or "alienation" (y), a state of
estrangement and banishment from the presence of God and Christ, and
from the society of the saints, to all eternity; see [Mat
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046.md).

[Job 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 31:4</span></span>

Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? That is, God, who is
above, and the Almighty that dwells on high; he looks down from heaven,
and beholds all the ways and works, the steps and motions, of the
children of men; there is no darkness where the workers of iniquity can
hide themselves; the fornicator and adulterer choose the night season
for the commission of their sin, fancying no eye sees them; but they
cannot escape the eye of God, who is omniscient; he observes the ways
they walk in, the methods they take to compass their designs; he marks
and counts every step taken by them, as he does indeed take notice of
and reckons up every action of men, good and bad; and the consideration
of this was another argument with Job to avoid the sin of uncleanness;
for however privately he might commit it, so as not to be seen by men,
it could not be hidden from the all seeing eye of God. Some take these
words to be an obtestation, or appeal to God for the truth of what he
had said; that he made a covenant with his eyes, and took every
precaution to prevent his failing into the sin of uncleanness; and he
whose eyes were upon his ways, knew how holily and unblamably he had
walked; or else, as if the sense was, that had he given in to such an
impure course of life, he might expect the omniscient God, that is
above, and dwells on high, would bring upon him destruction, and a
strange punishment, since he is the avenger of all such; others connect
the words with the following, doth he not see my ways and steps, whether
I have walked with vanity, &c. or not?

[Job 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 31:5</span></span>

If I have walked with vanity,.... Or with vain men, as Bar Tzemach
interprets it, keeping company and having fellowship with them in their
vain and sinful practices; or in the vanity of his mind, indulging
himself in impurity of heart and life; or rather using deceitful methods
to cheat and defraud others; for this seems to be another vice Job
clears himself of, acting unjustly in his dealings with men, or dealing
falsely with them:

or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; to cheat men in buying and selling,
being ready and swift to do it, and in haste to become rich, which puts
men oftentimes on evil ways and methods to attain it; see [Pro
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#020.md).

[Job 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 31:6</span></span>

Let me be weighed in an even balance,.... Or "in balances of
righteousness" (z), even in the balance or strict justice, the justice
of God; he was so conscious to himself that he had done no injustice to
any man in his dealings with them, that, if weight of righteousness,
which was to be, and was the rule of his conduct between man and man,
was put into one scale, and his actions into another, the balance would
be even, there would be nothing wanting, or, however, that would require
any severe censure:

that God may know mine integrity; God did knew his integrity, and bore a
testimony to it, and to his retaining it, [Job
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#003.md); but his meaning is, that should
God strictly inquire into his life and conduct with respect to his
dealings with men, as it would appear that he had lived in all good
conscience to that day, so he doubted not but he would find his
integrity such, that he would own and acknowledge it, approve of it, and
commend it, and make it known to his friends and others, whereby he
would be cleared of all those calumnies that were cast upon him. Some
connect these words with the following, reading them affirmatively, "God
knows mine integrity"; he knows that my step has not turned out of the
way of truth and righteousness; that my heart has not walked after mine
eye, in lustful thoughts and desires; and that there is no spoil, nor
rapine, nor violence in my hand, that I should deserve such a punishment
as to sow, and another eat: thus Sephorno.

[Job 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 31:7</span></span>

If my step hath turned out of the way,.... The way of God, the way of
his commandments, the good and right way, the way of truth and
righteousness, so far as Job had knowledge of it: for, besides the law
and light of nature the Gentiles had in common, good men had some
revelation, and notions of the mind and will of God unto them, both
before and after the flood, previous to the Mosaic dispensation; which
in some measure directed them what way to walk in, with respect to
worship and duty; and from this way Job swerved not; not that he walked
so perfectly in it as to be free from sin, and never commit any; or that
he never took a step out of the way, or stepped awry; but he did not
knowingly, wittingly, and purposely turn out of the way; and when,
through infirmity of the flesh, the temptations of Satan, and snares of
the world, he was drawn aside, he did not obstinately and finally
persist therein; though this may have respect not to sin in general, but
to the particular sin he is clearing himself from, namely, dealing
falsely and deceitfully with men, in whatsoever he had to do with them,
in matters of "meum" and "tuum"; or with regard to the rules of justice
and equity between man and man, he was not conscious to himself he had
departed from them; a like expression to those in [Psa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003.md), where some particular sin is
referred unto:

and mine heart walked after mine eyes; meaning not in the lust of
uncleanness, of which he had spoken before, as such do whose eyes are
full of adultery; but in the sin of covetousness, so Achan's heart
walked after his eyes, [Jos 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#020.md); and
this is one of the three things the world is full of, and the men of it
indulge themselves in, the lust of the eyes, [Jo1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016.md); the sense is, that when he saw
the riches and wealth of others, he did not covet them, nor take any
illicit methods to get them out of their hands; or, when he saw the
goods they were possessed of, and had with them to dispose of, he did
not take the advantage of their ignorance, or use any evil ways and
means to cheat and beguile them of them: it is pleasing to the flesh for
the heart to walk after the eye, or to indulge to that which it is taken
with; but it is very vain and foolish, as well as very dangerous so to
do, [Ecc 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010.md); a good man chooses a
better guide than his eyes; even to be a follower of God, to tread in
the steps of his living Redeemer, to walk not after the flesh, but after
the Spirit, and according to the law and will of God:

and if any blot cleaved to my hands; any spot, stain, or blemish, as all
sin is of a defiling nature, particularly the hands may be blotted by
shedding innocent blood, by taking bribes to pervert judgment; which the
Septuagint version directs to here; and by getting, holding, and
retaining mammon of unrighteousness, or ill gotten goods; which is what
is chiefly if not solely intended here; for it may be rendered, "if any
thing hath cleaved", &c. so Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom; for the word
signifies both a "blot" and "anything": and the Targum takes in both
senses: the meaning seems to be, that there was not anything of another
man's in his hands, which he had taken from him by force and violence,
or find obtained by any deceitful methods, and which he held fast, and
it stuck with him as pitch to the hands, and he did not care to part
with it, or restore it, whereby his hands were defiled; otherwise Job
had no such opinion of the cleanness of his hands and actions, as if he
thought there was no spot of sin in them, or only such as he could wash
out himself; he clearly speaks the contrary, [Job
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030.md); which is the sense of every good
man, who, conscious of his spots and blemishes, washes his hands, his
actions, his conversation garments, and makes them white in the blood of
the Lamb; and such, and such only, have clean hands.

[Job 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 31:8</span></span>

Then let me sow, and another eat,.... If what he had before said was not
true; but he had turned out of the way of righteousness, and walked
after the sight of his eyes, and the mammon of unrighteousness cleaved
to his hands; then he wishes might sow his fields, and another enjoy the
increase of them, which is one of God's judgments threatened unto the
wicked and disobedient, [Lev 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md);

let my offspring be rooted out; but Job had no offspring or children at
this time to be rooted out or destroyed; they were all destroyed
already; some think therefore that this imprecation was made by him in
the time of his prosperity, though here repeated as it was then, he made
a covenant with his eyes; but then this might have been improved against
him and retorted on him, that so it was according to his wish; and
therefore he must have been guilty of the sin he would have purged
himself from; others suppose that he refers to the future, and to the
offspring he hoped to have hereafter; and when he should have them,
wishes they may be rooted out, if he had done what he denies he had; but
it does not appear that Job had any hope at all of being restored to his
former state of prosperity, and of being possessed of a family and
substance again, but the reverse. Gussetius (a) will have it, that he
means his grandchildren; those indeed are sometimes called a man's
children, and may propriety be said to be his offspring, they springing
frown him; and it is possible, that, as his sons were settled from him,
they were married and had children; but this is not certain, or, if they
had any, that these were not destroyed with them; wherefore it is best
to take the word (b) in its first and literal sense, for what springs
out of the earth, herbs, plants, and trees, as in [Isa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005.md); so Ben Gersom and Bar Tzemach,
and which best agrees with the phrase of being "rooted out", and with
what goes before; that as he had wished that which was sown in his
fields might be eaten up by another, so what was planted and grew up in
his gardens, orchards, vineyards, and olive yards, and the like, might
be quite rooted out and destroyed; if he was not the man he declared
himself to be, or had wronged any of their goods and property, then this
would have been a just retaliation of him.

[Job 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 31:9</span></span>

If mine heart have been deceived by a woman,.... By another man's wife,
by wantonly looking at her beauty, and so lusting after her; and so, not
through any blame or fault of hers, or by any artful methods made use of
by her, to allure and ensnare; such as were practised by the harlot,
[Pro 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001.md); but by neither was the heart
of Job deceived, and drawn into the sin of uncleanness; for he had made
a covenant with his eyes, as not to look at a virgin, so much less at
another man's wife, to prevent his lusting after her; and whatever
temptations and solicitations he might have been attended with, through
the grace of God, as Joseph was, he was enabled to withstand them;
though as wise a man, and the wisest of men, had his heart deceived and
drawn aside thereby, [Ecc 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md);

or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door: to meet with his wife
there, and carry on an intrigue with her; or to take the opportunity of
going in when opened, in order to solicit her to his embraces, knowing
her husband to be away from home; see [Pro
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#008.md).

[Job 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 31:10</span></span>

Then let my wife grind unto another,.... Which some understand
literally, of her being put to the worst of drudgery and slavery, to
work at a mill, and grind corn for the service of a stranger, and be
exposed to the company of the meanest of persons, and to their insults
and abuses; as we find such as were taken captives and made prisoners by
an enemy were put unto, as Samson, [Jdg
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021.md); and it may be observed, that to
grind in a mill was also the work of women, [Exo
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005.md); as it was in early times; Homer
(c) speaks of it as in times before him; but others take the words in a
figurative sense, as if he imprecated that she lie with another man, and
be defiled by him, as the Targum, Aben Ezra, and others (d); see [Isa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md); and in like manner the following
clause:

and let others bow down upon her; both which phrases are euphemisms, or
clean and decent expressions, signifying what otherwise is not to be
named; the Scriptures hereby directing, as to avoid unchaste thoughts,
inclinations, and desires, and impure actions, so obscene words and
filthy talking, as becometh saints: but there is some difficulty in
Job's imprecating or wishing such a thing might befall his wife; it
could not be lawful, if he had sinned, to wish his wife might sin also;
or, if he was an adulterer, that she should be an adulteress; the sense
is not, that Job really wished such a thing; but he uses such a way of
speaking, to show how remote he was from the sin of uncleanness, there
being nothing more disagreeable to a man than for his wife to defile his
bed; it is the last thing he would wish for: and moreover Job suggests
hereby, that had he been guilty of this sin, he must own and acknowledge
that he would be righteously served, and it would be a just retaliation
upon him, should his wife use him, or she be used, in such a manner;
likewise, though a man may not wish nor commit a sin for the punishment
of another; yet God sometimes punishes sin with sin, and even with the
same kind of sin, and with this; so David's sin with Bathsheba was
punished with Absalom lying with his wives and concubines before the
sun, [Sa2 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011.md); see [Deu
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030.md).

For this is an heinous crime,.... Adultery; it is contrary to the light
of nature, and is condemned by it as a great sin, [Gen
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#009.md); as well as contrary to the
express will and law of God, [Exo
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#014.md); and, though all sin is a
transgression of the law of God, and deserving of death; yet there are
some sins greater and more heinous than others, being attended with
aggravating circumstances; and such is this sin, it is a breach of the
marriage contract and covenant between man and wife; it is doing injury
to a man's property, and to that which is the nearest and dearest to
him, and is what introduces confusion into families, kingdoms, and
states; and therefore it follows:

yea, it is an iniquity to he punished by the judges; who might take
cognizance of it, examine into it, and pass sentence for it, and execute
it; and, if they neglect do their duty, God, the Judge of all the earth,
will punish for it in the world to come, unless repented of: "for
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge", [Heb
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md); the punishment of adultery was
death by the law of God, and that by stoning, as appears from [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md); and it is remarkable, that the
Heathens, who were ignorant of this law, enjoined the same punishment
for it; so Homer (e) introduces Hector reproving Paris for this sin, and
suggests to him, that if he had his deserved punishment, he would have
been clothed with a "stone coat", as he beautifully expresses it; which
Suidas (f) explains, by being overwhelmed with stones, or stoned; as
Eustathius (g).

For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction,.... Referring either to
the nature of the sin of uncleanness; it is inflammatory, a burning
lust, a fire burning in the breast; see [Co1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md); or to the effect of it, either
the rage of jealousy in the injured person, which is exceeding fierce,
furious, and cruel, like devouring fire, not to be appeased or
mitigated, [Pro 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#034.md); or else it may
respect the punishment of this sin in the times of Job, and which we
find was practised among the Gentiles, as the Canaanites, Job's
neighbours, burning such delinquents with fire; see [Gen
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024.md); or rather the wrath of God for
it, which is poured forth as fire, and burns to the lowest hell, and
into which lake of fire all such impure persons will be cast, unless the
grace of God prevents; and which will be a fire that will consume and
destroy both soul and body, and so be an utter and everlasting
destruction, [Rev 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008.md);

and would root out all my increase; even in this world; adultery is a
sin that not only ruins a man's character, fixes an indelible blot upon
him, a reproach that shall not be wiped off, and consumes a man's body,
and destroys the health of it, but his substance also, the increase of
his fields, and of his fruits, and by means of it a man is brought to a
piece of bread, to beg it, and to be glad of it, [Pro
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#026.md).

If I did despise the cause of my manservant, or of my maidservant,....
Whether it was a cause that related to any controversy or quarrel among
themselves when it was brought before him, he did not reject it, because
of the meanness of the contending parties, and the state of servitude
they were in; but he received it and searched into it, heard patiently
what each had to say, examined them thoroughly, entered into the merits
of the cause, and either reconciled them, or passed a righteous
sentence, punished the delinquent, and protected the innocent; or, if it
was a cause relating to himself, any complaint of their work, or wages,
or food, or clothing, as it seems to be from what follows:

when they contended with me; had anything to complain of, or to object
to him on the above account, or any other, where there was any show or
colour of foundation for it; otherwise it cannot be thought he would
indulge a saucy, impudent, and contradicting behaviour in them towards
him: masters in those times and countries had an unlimited, and
exercised a despotic power over their servants, and used them with great
rigour, and refused to do them justice upon complaints; but Job behaved
as if he had had the rules of the apostle before him to act by in his
conduct towards his servants, [Eph
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009.md); and even condescended to submit
the cause between him and his servants to other judges or arbitrators,
or rather took cognizance of it himself, heard patiently and carefully
what they had to allege, and did them justice.

[Job 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 31:14</span></span>

What then shall I do when God riseth up?.... That is, if he had despised
and rejected the cause of his servants, or had neglected, or refused to
do them justice; he signifies he should be at the utmost loss to know
what to do, what excuse to make, or what to say in his own defence, when
God should rise up to defend the cause of the injured; either in a way
of Providence in this life, or at the great day of judgment in the world
to come, when everything will be brought to account, and masters and
servants must stand alike before the judgment seat of God, to receive
for the things they have done, whether good or evil:

and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? when he makes a
visitation among men, either in this world, even in a fatherly way,
visits transgressions, and reproves and corrects for them; had he been
guilty of ill usage of his servants, he must have silently submitted to
such visitations and chastisements, having nothing to say for himself
why he should not be thus dealt with; or in the world to come, in the
great day of visitation, when God shall make inquisition for sin, and
seek it out, and call to an account for it; and should this be produced
against him, even contempt of the cause of his servants, he was sensible
he could not answer him for it, nor for anyone sin of a thousand, as no
man will be able to do; but must be speechless, unless he has a better
righteousness than his own to answer for him in that time to come. This
is Job's first reason which deterred him from using his servants ill;
another follows.

[Job 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 31:15</span></span>

Did not he that made me in the womb make him?.... And her also, both his
manservant and maidservant: these were made, by the Lord as Job was, and
in a like place and manner as he himself; though parents are the
instruments of begetting children, and of bringing them into the world,
God is the Maker of men, as at the beginning, and all are alike made by
him, in whatsoever rank, condition, and circumstance of life, whether
masters or servants; and they are all fabricated in the same shop of
nature, the womb of a woman:

and did not one fashion us in the womb? that is, he who is the one God,
according to [Mal 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010.md); God is one in
nature and essence, though there are three Persons in the unity of the
Godhead; and this one God, Father, Son, and Spirit, is the Creator of
all men and things; hence we read of "Creators", [Ecc
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md); and, though one God makes the
bodies and creates the souls of men now as at the first, and all are
formed and fashioned by him, high, low, rich and poor, bond and free;
and they have all the same rational powers and faculties of soul, [Psa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#015.md); as well as the same curious art
and skill are employed in forming and fashioning their bodies and the
members of them, in the lower parts of the earth, in their mother's
womb; yea, they are fashioned "in one womb" (h), as the words will
better bear to be rendered according to the position of them in the
original and the accents; not indeed in the same identical womb, but in
a like one: there are two words in the original here, both translated
"womb"; the one signifies the "ovarium", in which the conception is
made; the other designs the "secundine", in which the fetus is wrapped
or covered; for so it may be rendered, "did he not cover us?" &c. (i);
though Jarchi, Aben Ezra, Ben Gersom, and others, interpret it of the
one God as we do: Job's reasoning is, that seeing he and his servants
were equally the workmanship of God, and both made in the womb by him,
and curiously fashioned alike, and possessed of the same rational
powers, it would be unreasonable in him to use them ill, who were his
fellow creatures; and should he, he might expect the Maker of them both
would highly resent it. Macrobius (k), an Heathen writer, gives a
remarkable instance of the care heaven, as he expresses it, has of
servants, and how much the contempt of it is resented thereby; and
reasons much in the same manner concerning them as Job does here, that
they are men, though servants; are of the same original, breathe in the
same air, live and die as other men.

If I have withheld the poor from their desire,.... Their reasonable
desires, and which it was in his power to grant; as when they desired a
piece of bread, being hungry, or clothes to cover them, being naked; but
not unreasonable desires, seeking and asking great things for
themselves, or unlimited and unbounded ones, such as the two sons of
Zebedee desired of Christ, [Mar 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035.md);

or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; through long waiting for,
and expecting help and succour from him, and at last disappointed. Job
did not use the widow in such a manner as to give her reason to hope for
relief or counsel from him she came for, and make her wait long, and
then send her away empty, as he was charged, [Job
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#009.md); but he soon dispatched her, by
granting her what she sued to him for.

Or have eaten my morsel myself alone,.... Though he had kept no doubt a
plentiful table in the time of his prosperity suitable to his
circumstances, yet had been no luxurious person, and therefore calls
provisions a "morsel"; however, be it what it would, more or less, he
did not eat it alone; what he had for himself the poor had a share of it
with him, and the same he ate himself he gave to them:

and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof: meaning the poor fatherless:
for as to the rich fatherless, it was no charity to feed them: this
verse contradicts the charge exhibited against him, [Job
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#007.md).

[Job 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 31:18</span></span>

For from my youth he was brought up with me as with a father,.... That
is, the poor or the fatherless, one or both; as soon as he was at years
of discretion, and was capable of observing the distressed circumstances
of others, he had a tender and compassionate regard to the poor and
fatherless, and acted the part of a father to them; was as
affectionately concerned for them as if he had been their father, and
took such care of them as if they were his children; see [Job
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#016.md);

and I have guided her from my mother's womb; the widow, by his counsel
and advice; an hyperbolical expression, signifying how early he was a
succourer of such persons, by giving his friendly advice, or needful
assistance; the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "from my youth mercy
grew up with me", &c. a merciful disposition, a compassionate regard to
the poor and fatherless; this was as it were connatural to him; for
though there is no good disposition really in man, without the grace of
God, of which Job might early partake, yet there is a show of it in some
persons, in comparison of others; some have a natural tender disposition
to the poor, when others are naturally cruel and hardhearted to them;
and so Mr. Broughton renders the words to this sense,

"for from my youth this grew with me as a father, and from my mother did
I tender it:''

but the first sense seems best.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 31:19</span></span>

If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,.... A man may be in such
poor circumstances as to want proper clothing to cover his naked body
with, and preserve it from the inclemencies of the weather, and for want
of it be ready to perish or die with cold. Job denies he had seen any
such; not that he had never seen persons in such perishing
circumstances; but he had not seen them as to "despise" them, as the
Vulgate Latin version, as to have them in contempt, or look at them with
disdain because of their poverty and rags, or sordid apparel; or so as
to "overlook" them, as the Septuagint version, to neglect them, and to
take no notice of them, and make no provision for their clothing, a warm
and comfortable garment, as in [Job
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#020.md),

or any poor without covering; without clothing sufficient to cover
himself with, and keep him warm; Job had seen such objects, but he did
not leave them in such a condition; he saw them, and had compassion on
them, and clothed them.

[Job 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 31:20</span></span>

If his loins have not blessed me,.... Which were girded and covered with
garments he gave him; which, as often as he put on and girded his loins
with, put him in mind of his generous benefactor, and this put him upon
sending up an ejaculatory wish to heaven, that all happiness and
blessedness might attend him, who had so comfortably clothed him; see
[Job 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#013.md);

and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; not with a fleece
of wool as taken off the back of the sheep, or with a sheep's skin,
having the wool on it, but with it, as made up into cloth; with a
woollen garment, which was a kind of clothing that very early obtained,
and is what is warm and comfortable, see [Deu
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#011.md). Job clothed the naked, not with
gay apparel, which was not necessary, but with decent and useful
raiment, and not with the fleece of other men's sheep, but with the
fleece of his own sheep, or with cloth made of the wool of his own
flock, giving what was his own and not others; which always should be
observed in acts of charity; see [Sa2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#004.md). Thus Christ, the antitype of
Job, feeds the poor and the fatherless whom he finds, though he does not
leave them so; it is at his own table, and with his own bread, with
provisions of his own making; and clothes them with the robe of his
righteousness, and garments of salvation, which is a clothing and a
covering to them, and secures them from perishing, and causes joy and
gladness in them, [Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md).

If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,.... Either in a
menacing way, threatening what he would do to them; which, from a man of
wealth and authority, a civil magistrate, a judge, is very terrible to
the poor and fatherless; or in order to strike him, which would be to
smite with the fist of wickedness; or give a signal to others, by
lifting up the hand to smite, as Ananias gave orders to smite the
Apostle Paul; or thereby to give his vote against the fatherless
wrongly, suffrages being sometimes made by lifting up the hands; or
hereby Job signifies, that he was so far from doing the fatherless any
real injury, that he had not so much as lifted up his hand, and even a
finger against him:

when I saw my help in the gate; in the court of judicature held in the
gate of the city, as was usual; though he knew he had the bench of
judges for him, or they would give sentence in his behalf, and against
the fatherless, if he did but hold up his hand, or lift up a finger to
them, so ready would they be take his part and be on his side; yet he
never made use of his power and interest to their detriment, or took
such an advantage against them.

Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade,.... With which the upper
part of it is connected; let it be disjointed from it, or rot and drop
off from it; a dreadful calamity this, to lose an arm and the use of it,
to have it full off immediately, as a judgment from God, and in just
retaliation for lifting up an hand or arm against the fatherless; as
Jeroboam's arm withered when he put it forth from the altar, and ordered
hands to be laid upon the prophet for crying against the altar, [Kg1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#004.md); and mine arm be broken from the
bone; from the channel bone, as the margin of our Bibles, or rather from
the elbow, the lower part of the arm and so may be rendered, "or mine
arm", &c. Eliphaz had brought a charge against Job, that the arms of the
fatherless had been broken, and suggests that they had been broken by
him, or by his orders, [Job 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#009.md); and
Job here wishes, that if that was the case, that his own arm was broken:
such imprecations are not to be made in common, or frequently, and only
when a man's innocence cannot be vindicated but by an appeal to the
omniscient God; an instance somewhat like this, see in [Psa
137:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#005.md).

For destruction from God was a terror to me,.... Though he feared not
men, they being at his beck and command, ready to do any thing for him
he should order, yet he feared God; and the dread of his resentment, and
of destruction from him the lawgiver, who is able to save and to
destroy, had such an influence on him as to deter and keep him from all
unkindness to the poor, and in justice to the fatherless; he dreaded the
destruction of himself, his family, and substance in this world, and
everlasting destruction of soul and body in the world to come; which of
all things is to be feared, [Mat
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028.md); and Old Testament saints were
much under a spirit of bondage to fear, and were actuated thereby; and,
though Job might not be under any dread of eternal damnation, knowing
his interest in the living Redeemer; yet he might fear temporal
destruction, as it is certain he did; which thing he feared came upon
him, though not for any crime or crimes he was guilty of, see [Job
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#025.md); he might fear, as a good man
may, the chastisements and corrections of his heavenly Father:

and by reason of his highness I could not endure; God is higher than the
highest angels, or men; he is above all gods, so called; he is God over
all, blessed for ever; and such is his height, his glory, and his
majesty, that it is terrible, and the dread of them makes men afraid;
nor can any sinner stand before him, nor withstand him, nor hope to
prevail against him, nor flee from his presence, nor escape out of his
hand, nor bear his wrath and indignation, and the coming down of his
arm; for what hands can be strong, or heart endure, when the almighty
God deals with them? or Job's sense may be, that such an awe of the
divine Being was always upon him, that he could not do any unkind thing
to the poor, or unjust one to the fatherless.

[Job 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 31:24</span></span>

If I have made gold my hope,.... Job here purges himself from idolatry
in a figurative sense, as he afterwards does from it, taken in a literal
sense; for covetousness is idolatry, and a covetous man is an idolater;
he worships his gold and silver, placing his affections on them, and
putting his trust and confidence in them, [Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md); for to make gold the object or
ground of hope is to place it in the room of God, who is the Hope of
Israel, and in whom every good man should trust, and whom he should make
his hope, [Jer 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#008.md); not gold on
earth, but glory in heaven, is what the good man is hoping for; and not
riches, but Christ and his righteousness, are the foundation of such an
hope; to make gold our hope, is to have hope in this life, and to make a
thing present the object of it; whereas true hope is of things not seen
and future, and if only in this life good men have hope, they are of all
most miserable; but they have in heavens better and a more enduring
substance, and a better ground for hope of that substance, than worldly
wealth and riches can give:

or have said to the fine gold, thou art my confidence; as bad men do,
and good men are prone unto, and therefore to be cautioned against it,
[Psa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md); for this is not only to
trust in uncertain riches, and in unsatisfying ones, but to put them in
the stead of God, who is or ought to be the confidence of the ends of
the earth: not gold, but the living God, who gives all things richly to
enjoy, is to be trusted in; when men covet riches, and trust in them as
their security from evil, and that they may live independent of the
providence of God, it is virtually to deny it, and carries in it secret
atheism; as well as such a confidence is destruction of the worship of
God, and such a temper makes a man an unprofitable hearer, plunges him
into errors and hurtful lusts, and endangers his everlasting happiness,
[Hab 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md); in later times the Romans
worshipped the goddess "Pecunia", or money, as Austin (z) relates.

If I rejoiced because my wealth was great,.... As it was, see [Job
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#002.md); yet he did not set his heart upon
it, please himself with it, indulge to a carnal joy on account of it,
nor suffer it to engross his affections, or alienate them from God his
chief joy; not but that a man may lawfully rejoice in the goodness of
God unto him, in increasing his wealth, and praise him for it, who has
placed him in such easy circumstances, and so comfortably provided for
him and his family, and put him into a capacity to do good to others;
and he may rejoice in what God has given him, and cheerfully partake of
it, [Ch1 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#013.md);

and because my hand had gotten much; though he had much wealth, he did
not ascribe it to his own industry, and applaud his own wisdom and
diligence, as men are apt to do, for all comes of God, and is owing to
his blessing; he did not please himself when become rich, as if his own
hand had found him much substance, as Ephraim did, [Hos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 31:26</span></span>

If I beheld the sun when it shined,.... Some take this to be a reason
why Job did not make gold his hope and confidence, because all sublunary
and earthly enjoyments must be uncertain, fading, and perish, since the
sun and moon are not without their deficiencies and changes, to which
sense the Septuagint version inclines; others, as Nachmanides, that they
are a denial that Job ascribed his wealth and substance to the influence
of the heavenly bodies; and many interpreters are of opinion that they
are a continuation of the same subject as before; Job hereby declaring
that neither his eye nor his heart were set upon his outward prosperity,
comparable to the light of the sun, and the brightness of the moon; that
he did not secretly please himself with it, nor congratulate himself
upon it nor applaud his own wisdom and industry; and of late Schultens
and others interpret it of flattering great personages, complimenting:
them, and courting their favour, which we call worshipping the rising
sun; but I rather think it is to be understood, as it more generally is,
of worshipping the sun and moon in a literal sense; which was the first
kind of idolatry men went into; those very ancient idolaters, the Zabii,
worshipped the sun as their greater god, as Maimonides (a) observes, to
whom he says they offered seven bats, seven mice, and seven other
creeping things, with some other things also; in later times horses were
offered to it, see [Kg2 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md). So the
ancient Egyptians worshipped the sun and moon, calling the one Osiris,
and the other Isis (b). The word for sun is "light", and it is so called
because it is a luminous body, and the fountain of light to others; it
is called the greater light, [Gen
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016.md); and from this Hebrew word "or",
with the Egyptians, Apollo, who is the sun, is called Horus, as
Macrobius (c) relates; it is said to "shine", as it always does, even
when below our horizon, or in an eclipse, or under a cloud, though not
seen by us. Job has here respect to its shining clearly and visibly, and
perhaps at noon day, when it is in its full strength; unless regard is
had to its bright and shining appearance at its rising, when the
Heathens used to pay their homage and adoration to it (d): now when Job
denies that he beheld it shining, it cannot be understood of the bare
sight of it, which he continually had; nor of beholding it with delight
and pleasure, which might be very lawfully done, [Ecc
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md); nor of considering it as the
work of God, being a very glorious and useful creature, in which his
glory is displayed, and for which he is to be praised, because of its
beneficial influence on the earth; see [Psa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003.md); but of his beholding it with
admiration, as if it was more than a creature, ascribing deity to it,
and worshipping it as God; and the same must be understood of the moon
in the next clause:

or the moon walking in brightness; as at first rising, or rather when in
the full, in the middle of the month, as Aben Ezra; when it walks all
night, in its brightness, illuminated by the sun: these two luminaries,
the one called the king, the other the queen of heaven, were very early
worshipped, if not the first instances of idolatry. Diodorus Siculus (e)
says, that the first men of old, born in Egypt, beholding and admiring
the beauty of the world, thought there were two gods in the nature of
the universe, and that they were eternal; namely, the sun and moon, the
one they called Osiris, and the other Isis; hence the Israelites, having
dwelt long in Egypt, were in danger of being drawn into this idolatry,
against which they are cautioned, [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md); and where was a city called
Heliopolis, or the city of the sun, as in the Greek version of [Isa
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md); where was a temple dedicated to
the worship of it; and so the Arabians, the neighbours of Job, according
to Herodotus (f), worshipped the sun and moon; for he says the Persians
were taught by them and the Assyrians to sacrifice to the sun and moon;
and so did the old Canaanites and the Phoenicians; hence one of their
cities is called Bethshemesh, the house or temple of the sun, [Jos
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#022), yea, we are told (g.md), that to
this day there are some traces of this ancient idolatry in Arabia, the
neighbourhood of Job; as in a large city in Arabia, upon the Euphrates,
called Anna, where they worship the sun only; this being common in those
parts in Job's time, he purges himself from it.

And mine heart hath been secretly enticed,.... Drawn away by beholding
the magnitude of these bodies, the swiftness of their motion, their
glorious appearance, and great usefulness to mankind, to entertain a
thought of their being deities; and privately to worship them, in secret
acts of devotion, as by an honourable esteem of them as such, reverence
and affection for them, trust and confidence in them; for, as there is a
secret worshipping of the true God, so there is a secret idolatry,
idolatry in the heart, and setting up of idols there, as well as
worshipping them in dark places, in chambers of imagery, as the Jews
did, [Eze 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012.md);

or my mouth hath kissed my hand; idols used to be kissed by their
votaries, in token of their veneration of them, and as expressive of
their worship of them; so Baal and Jeroboam's calves were kissed by the
worshippers of them, [Kg1 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018.md).
Kissing is used to signify the religious veneration, homage, and worship
of a divine Person, the Son of God, [Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md); and such deities especially that
were out of the reach of their worshippers, as the sun, moon, and stars
were, they used to put their hands to their mouths, and kiss them, in
token of their worship; just as persons now, at a distance from each
other, pay their civil respects to one another: instances of religious
adoration of idols performed in this manner; see Gill on [Hos
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md). Job denies that he had been
guilty of such idolatry, either secretly or openly.

This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge,.... As well as
adultery, [Job 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#011.md); by the civil
magistrates and judges of the earth, who are God's vicegerents, and
therefore it behooves them to take cognizance of such an iniquity, and
to punish for it, which affects in so peculiar a manner the honour and
worship of the true God; this by the law of Moses was punished by
stoning to death, [Deu 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009.md); however
this will be taken notice of and punished by God the Judge of all, whose
law is broken hereby, and who will visit this iniquity more especially
on those who commit it, and their posterity after them. Idolaters of
every sort shall have their part and portion in the lake which burns
with fire and brimstone, [Exo 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003.md);
the consideration of its being such a heinous sin, and so deserving of
punishment, deterred Job from it; the Targum paraphrases it, a most
amazing iniquity, it being, as follows, a denial of the true God:

for I should have denied the God that is above; that is, had he
worshipped the sun and moon secretly or openly; for, as the atheist
denies him in words, the idolater denies him in facts, worshipping the
creature besides the Creator, and giving his glory to another, and his
praise to idols; which is a virtual denial of him, even of him who is
above the sun and moon in place, being higher than the heavens; and in
nature, excellency, and glory, being the Creator of them, and they his
creatures; and in power and authority, who commands the sun, and it
rises not, and has appointed the moon for seasons, [Job
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#007.md).

If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,.... Job, though a
good man, had his enemies, as all good men have, and that because of
their goodness, and who hated him with an implacable hatred, without a
cause, there being a rooted bitter enmity in the seed of the serpent
against the godly in all generations; on whom sooner or later, at one
time or another, destruction comes, one calamity or another on their
families, diseases on their bodies, loss of substance, death of
themselves or relatives; now it is a common thing with wicked men to
rejoice in the adversity of their enemies, but good men should not do
so; yet it is a difficult thing, and requires a large measure of grace,
and that in exercise, not to feel any pleasing emotion, a secret joy and
inward pleasure, at the hearing of anything of this sort befalling an
enemy; which is a new crime Job purges himself from:

or lifted up myself when evil found him; either the evil of sin, which
sooner or later finds out the sinner, charges him with guilt, and
requires punishment, or the evil of punishment for sin; which, though it
may seem to move slowly, pursues the sinner, and will overtake him, and
light upon him. Mr. Broughton renders the words, "and bestirred me when
he found loss": loss in his family, in his cattle, and in his substance;
now, when this was the case, Job did not raise up himself in a haughty
manner, and insult and triumph over him, or stir up himself to joy and
rejoicing, or to make joyful motions, as Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom
interpret it; and by his gestures show that he was elated with the evil
that had befallen his enemy; indeed so far as the fall and destruction
of the wicked make for the public good, for the interest of religion,
for the glory of God, and the honour of his justice, it is lawful for
good men to rejoice thereat; but not from a private affection, or from a
private spirit of revenge, see [Psa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md).

[Job 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 31:30</span></span>

Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin,.... Which, as it is the
instrument of speech, is often the means of much sin; particularly of
cursing men, and expressing much bitterness against enemies; but Job
laid an embargo upon it, kept it as with a bridle, restrained it from
uttering any evil, or wishing any to his worst adversaries; which is
difficult to do, when provocations are given, as follows:

by wishing a curse to his soul; not to his soul as distinct from his
body, being the superior excellency and immortal part; that it be
everlastingly damned, as wicked men wish to their own souls, and the
souls of others, but to his person, wishing some calamity might befall
him, some disease seize upon him, or that God would take him away by
death: Job would never suffer himself to wish anything of this kind unto
his enemy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 31:31</span></span>

If the men of my tabernacle,.... Either his friends, that came to visit
him, and take a meal with him, and would sometimes tarry awhile with him
in his house, being very free and familiar with him; and who were, as it
were, at home in his tabernacle; or rather his domestic servants, that
were under his roof, and dwelt in his house, see [Job
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#015.md); if these

said not, oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied; of the
flesh of Job's enemy; and the sense is that his servants used to say,
are cannot bear to see our master so ill used and insulted by his enemy;
we wish he would only allow us to avenge him on him, we would eat him up
alive; we would devour him, and destroy him at once; nor can we be
satisfied unless we have leave to do it: and so this is a further proof
of Job's patience with his enemies, that though he had fetters on in his
family, his servants solicited him to revenge, yet he abstained from it;
which may be exemplified in the cases of David and of Christ, [Sa1
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008.md), though some think these words
express Job's patience towards his servants, who were so angry with him
for the strict discipline he observed in his house, that they wished
they had his flesh to eat, and could not be satisfied without it; and
yet, so far was he from taking pleasure in the calamities of his
enemies, and wishing ill to them, that he did not resent the ill natured
speeches of his servants, and avenge himself on them for their wicked
insults upon him: but it can hardly be thought that Job would keep such
wicked servants in his house; but perhaps Job here enters upon a new
crime, which he clears himself of, and is opened more fully in [Job
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#032.md), namely, inhospitality to
strangers; since the particle "if" commonly begins a new article in this
chapter, and being taken in this sense, various interpretations are
given; some, as if Job's servants were displeased with him for his
hospitality, that his house was always so full of guests, that they were
continually employed in dressing food for them, that they had not time,
or that there was not enough left for them to eat of his flesh, his
food, and be satisfied with it; or else, as pleased with the plentiful
table he kept, and therefore desired to continue always in his service,
and eat of his food; nor could they be satisfied with the food of
others, or live elsewhere; though perhaps it is best of all to render
the words, as by some, who will give, or show the man "that is not
satisfied of his flesh?" (h) point out the man in all the neighbourhood
that has not been liberally entertained at Job's table to his full
satisfaction and content; and his liberality did not extend only to his
neighbours, but to strangers also; as follows.

The stranger did not lodge in the street,.... By a stranger is not meant
an unconverted man, that is a stranger to God and godliness, to Christ,
and the way of salvation by him, to the Spirit of God and spiritual
things, nor a good man, who is a stranger and pilgrim on earth; but one
that is out of his nation and country, and at a distance from it,
whether a good man or a bad man; these Job would not suffer to lie in
the streets in the night season, exposed to the air and the inclemencies
of it; see [Jdg 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#015.md);

but I opened my doors to the traveller; even all the doors of his house,
to denote his great liberality, that as many as would might enter it;
and this was done by himself, or, however, by his order; and some think
that it signifies that he was at his door, waiting and watching for
travellers to invite them in, as Abraham and Lot, [Gen
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001.md); or his doors were opened "to the
way" (i): as it may be rendered, to the roadside; his house was built by
the wayside; or, however, the doors which lay towards that side were
thrown open for travellers to come in at as they pleased, and when they
would; so very hospitable and kind to strangers and travellers was Job,
and so welcome were they to his house and the entertainment of it, see
[Heb 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002.md).

If I covered my transgressions as Adam,.... Job could not be understood,
by this account he had given of the holiness of his life, that he
thought himself quite free from sin; he had owned himself to be a sinner
in several places before, and disclaimed perfection; and here he
acknowledges he was guilty of transgressing the law of God, and that in
many instances; for he speaks of his "transgressions" in the plural
number; but then he did not seek to cover them from the of God or men,
but frankly and ingenuously confessed them to both; he did not cover
them, palliate, excuse, and extenuate them, as Adam did his, by laying
the blame to his wife; and as she by charging it on the serpent; and
those excuses they made are the inventions they found out, [Ecc
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md); or the meaning is, Job did not
do "as men" (k) in common do; who, when they have sinned, either through
fear or shame, endeavour to conceal it, and keep it out of the sight of
others, unless they are very hardened and audacious sinners, such as the
men of Sodom were, see [Hos 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#007.md);

by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom; meaning perhaps some particular
iniquity which his nature was most inclined to; this he did not attempt
to hide in secret, as what is put into the bosom is; or that he did not
spare it and cherish it, and, from an affection to it, keep it as
persons and things beloved are, laid in the bosom; and so Mr. Broughton
reads the words, "hiding my sin of a self-love"; either having a
self-love to it, or hiding it of self-love, that is, from a principle of
self-love, to preserve his honour, credit, and reputation among men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 31:34</span></span>

Did I fear a great multitude?.... No, they did not deter him from
confessing his sin in the most public manner, when sensible or convicted
of it, and when such a public acknowledgment was necessary:

or did the contempt of families terrify me? no, the contempt he might
suppose he should be had in by some families that knew him, and he was
well acquainted with, did not terrify him from making a free and
ingenuous confession of his sins:

that I kept silence; or "did I keep silence",

and went not out of the door? so as not to open his mouth by confession
in public, but kept within doors through fear and shame; or else the
sense is, that he was not intimidated from doing his duty as a civil
magistrate, administering justice to the poor and oppressed; neither the
dread of a clamorous mob, nor the contempt of families of note, or great
personages, could deter him from the execution of his office with
uprightness, so as to cause him to be silent, and keep at home; but
without any regard to the fear of the one, or the contempt of the other,
he went out from his house through the street to the court of
judicature, took his place on the bench, and gave judgment in favour of
those that were oppressed, though the multitude was against them, and
even persons and families of note: or thus, though I could have put a
great multitude to fear, yet the most contemptible persons in any
family, so Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom interpret that phrase, the meanest
person, or but a beggar, if his cause was just, terrified him; or such
was the fear of God upon him, that he durst do no other than to do him
justice; so that he could not open his mouth against him, or stir out of
doors to do him the tease; injury; though perhaps it may be best of all,
with Schultens, to consider these words as an imprecation, that if what
he had said before from [Job 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024.md) was
not true; if he was not clear from idolatry figurative, and literal,
from a malicious and revengeful spirit, from inhospitality and
unkindness to strangers, from palliating, excusing, and extenuating his
sins; then as if he should say, may I be frightened with a tumult, or a
multitude of people, and terrified with the public contempt of families;
may I be as silent as a mope in my own house, and never dare to stir out
of doors, or show my thee, or see face of any man any more: and then,
before he had quite finished his account of himself, breaks out in the
following manner.

Oh, that one would hear me!.... Or, "who will give me a hearer?" (l) Oh,
that I had one! not a nearer of him as a teacher and instructor of many,
as he had been, [Job 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#003.md); or only to
hear what he had delivered in this chapter; but to hear his cause, and
hear him plead his own cause in a judiciary way; he does not mean an
ordinary hearer, one that, comes out of curiosity into courts of
judicature to hear causes tried, what is said on both sides, and how
they will issue; but, as Bar Tzemach paraphrases it,

"who shall give me a judge that shall hear me,''

that would hear his cause patiently, examine it thoroughly, and judge
impartially, which is the business of judges to do, [Deu
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#016.md); he did not care who it was, if
he had but such an one; though he seems to have respect to God himself,
from what he says in the next clause, and wishes that he would but hear,
try, and judge his cause:

behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me: answer to what
he had said, or had further to say in his own defence; this is a request
he had made before, and now repeats it, see [Job
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#022.md); some render it, "behold my
mark", or "scope" (m); so Mr. Broughton, "behold my scope in this"; this
is what I aim at, what I design and mean by wishing for an hearer, that
the Almighty himself would take the cause in hand, and give me an
answer: or, "behold my sign" (n); the sign of my innocence, appealing to
God, leaving my cause to be heard, tried, and judged by him, who is my
witness, and will answer for me; see [Job
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#019.md); as well as desiring mine
adversary to put down in writing what he has against me; or, "behold my
signature" (o); the plea I have given is signed by my own hand: now "let
the Almighty answer me"; a bold expression indeed, and a making too free
with the Almighty, and was one of those speeches Job was to be blamed
for, and for which he was after humbled and repented of:

and that mine adversary had written a book; or "the man of my
contention" (p): either that contended for him, as Aben Ezra, that
pleaded for him, was his advocate in court, whom he would have take a
brief of him, and so distinctly plead his cause; or rather that
contended against him, a court adversary, by whom he means either his
three friends, or some one of them, whom he more especially took for his
enemy; see [Job 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009.md); and who he
wishes had brought a bill of indictment, and put down in a book, on a
paper in writing, the charge he had against him; that so it might be
clearly known what could be alleged against him; and that it might be
particularly and distinctly examined; when he doubted not but he should
be able to give a full answer to every article in it; and that the very
bill itself would carry in it a justification of him: or it may be,
rather he means God himself, who carried it towards him as an adversary,
at least in a providential way; he had before requested that be would
show him wherefore he contended with him, [Job
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#002.md); and now he desires he would give
in writing his charge against him, being fully confident, that if he had
but the opportunity of answering to it before him, he should be able
sufficiently to vindicate himself; and that he should come off with
honour, as follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">job 31:36</span></span>

Surely I would take it upon my shoulder,.... The bill of indictment, the
charge in writing; this he would take up and carry on his shoulder as a
very light thing, having nothing weighty in it, no charge of sin and
guilt to bear him down; nothing but what he could easily stand up under,
only some trifling matter, which could not be interpreted sin; for
anything of that kind would have been a burden too heavy for him to have
borne: or else his sense is, that should he be convicted of any sin, he
would openly confess the charge, acknowledge the sin in the most public
manner, that being visible which is borne upon the shoulder; and would
also patiently bear the afflictions and chastisements that were laid
upon him for it: though rather the meaning is, that he should take up
and carry such a bill, not as a burden, but as an honour, as one bears a
sword of state, or carries a sceptre as an ensign of royalty on his
shoulder; to which the allusion may be in [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); not at all doubting but it would
turn out to his glory; which is confirmed by what follows;

and bind it as a crown to me, or "crowns" (q), having various circles of
gold hung with jewels; signifying that he would not only take his bill
or charge, and carry it on his shoulder, but put it on his head, and
wear it there, as a king does his crown; which is an ornament and honour
to him, as he should reckon this bill, seeing it would give him an
opportunity of clearing himself effectually.

I would declare to him the number of my steps,.... To his judge, or to
him that contended with him, and drew up the bill against him; he would
forward it, assist in it, furnish materials for it, give an account of
all the transactions of his life that he could remember; this he says
not as though he thought that God stood in need of any such declaration,
since he better knows the actions of men than they themselves, compasses
their paths, and is acquainted with all their ways; but to show how
confident he was of his innocence, and how little he feared the
strictest and closest examination of his ways and works, knowing that he
had lived with all good conscience unto that day:

and as a prince would I go near unto him; either he should consider such
an hearer and judge of his cause he desired as a prince, and reverence
and respect him as such; he should be as dear unto him, though his
adversary that contended with him, as a prince; and he should be as
ambitious of an acquaintance with him as with a prince: or rather he
means that he himself as a prince, in a princely manner, and with a
princely spirit, should draw nigh to his judge, to answer to the bill in
writing against him; that he should not come up to the bar like a
malefactor, that shows guilt in his countenance, and by his trembling
limbs, and shrinking back, not caring to come nigh, but choosing rather
to stand at a distance, or get off and escape if he could; but on the
other hand, Job would go up to his judge, and to the judgment seat, with
all the stateliness of a prince, with an heroic, intrepid, and undaunted
spirit; like a "bold prince", as Mr. Broughton renders the word; see

If my land cry against me,.... Some think that this verse and [Job

should rather follow after [Job 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#034.md);

and others after [Job 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#008.md); but this
is the order of them in all copies and versions, as they stand in our
Bibles; and here, after Job had expressed his desire to have a hearer
and judge of his cause, and his charge exhibited in writing, and his
confidence of the issue of it, should it be granted, returns to his
former subject, to clear himself from any notorious vice he was
suspected of or charged with; and as he had gone through what might
respect him in private life, here he gives another instance in public
life, with which he concludes; namely, purging himself from tyranny and
oppression, with which his friends had charged him without any proof;
and he denies that the land he lived on was possessed of, and of which
he was the proprietor, cried against him as being unjustly gotten,
either by fraud or by force, from others; or as being ill used by him
either as being too much cultivated, having never any rest, or lying
fallow; and so much weakened and drained of its strength, or neglected
and overrun with weeds, thorns, and thistles; or on account of the
dressers and tillers of it being badly dealt with, either overworked, or
not having sufficiency of food, or their wages, detained from them; all
which are crying sins, and by reason of which the land by a figure may
be said to cry out as the stone out of the wall, and the beam out of the
timber, because of the sins of spoil, violence, oppression, and
covetousness, [Hab 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011.md);

or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; or "weep" (a), on account
of the like ill usage. Jarchi, and so the Midrash, interpret this of not
allowing the forgotten sheaf and corner of the field to the poor, and
detaining the tithes; and of ploughing and making furrows with an ox and
an ass together; but the laws respecting these things were not yet in
being; and if they had been, were only binding on Israelites, and not on
Job, and the men of his country.

If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,.... Or, "the strength
thereof without silver" (b); see [Gen
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#012.md), silver being the money chiefly
in use in those times. Job's meaning is, that he ate not anything of the
fruits and increase of his own land, without having paid for the same,
which he would have done, if he had got his land out of the hands of the
rightful owners of it, by deceit or violence; or if he had not paid his
workmen for ploughing, sowing, reaping, &c. or if he had demanded the
fruits of the earth of his tenants, to whom he had let out his farms,
without giving them a proper price for them:

or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life; as Jezebel caused
Naboth to lose his, who was the original proprietor, that Ahab might
possess it, [Kg1 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#007.md); or it may
signify tenants, to whom Job rented out fields, but did not starve them
by renting them under hard leases, or lands on hard terms, so that they
could not live upon them; or it may design the tillers of the land, as
Jarchi and Bar Tzemach; those that wrought in it, the servants that were
employed in ploughing, &c. to whom wages were due, and who had not too
hard labour imposed upon them, to the endangering of their lives; or he
did not "afflict and grieve" (c) them, as some versions; or make their
lives bitter, through hard bondage and service, as the Israelites in
Egypt.

Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley,....
This is an imprecation of Job's, in which he wishes that if what he had
said was not true, or if he was guilty of the crimes he denied, that
when and where he sowed wheat, thorns or thistles might come up instead
of it, or tares, as some Jewish writers (d) interpret it; and that when
and where he should sow barley, cockle, or darnel, or any "stinking" or
"harmful" weed (e), as the word signifies, might spring up in room of
it; respect seems to be had to the original curse upon the earth, and by
the judgment of God is sometimes the case, that a fruitful land is
turned into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell in it, [Gen
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018.md);

the words of Job are ended; which is either said by himself, at the
close of his speech; thus far says Job, and no farther, having said
enough in his own defence, and for the confutation of his antagonists,
and so closes in a way of triumph: or else this was added by Moses,
supposed to have written this book; or by some other hand, as Ezra, upon
the revision of it, and other books of the Old Testament, when put in
order by him: and these were the last words of Job to his friends, and
in vindication of himself; for though there is somewhat more said
afterwards by him, and but little, yet to God, and by way of
humiliation, acknowledging his sin, and repentance for it with shame and
abhorrence; see [Job 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#003.md). Jarchi, and
so the Midrash, understand this concluding clause as all imprecation of
Job's; that if he had done otherwise than he had declared, he wishes
that these might be his last words, and he become dumb, and never open
his mouth more; but, as Bar Tzemach observes, the simple sense is, that
his words were now completed and finished, just as the prayers of David,
