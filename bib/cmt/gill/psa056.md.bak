INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 56

To the chief Musician upon Jonathelemrechokim, Michtam of David when the
Philistines took him in Gath. The words "jonathelemrechokim" are by our
translators left untranslated. Aben Ezra takes them to be the beginning
of a song; and others think they are the name of a musical instrument:
but they seem rather to design the subject matter of the psalm, and may
be rendered, "concerning the mute dove among them that are afar off"
(m), or "in far places" (n); and refer to David, who, when he wrote this
psalm, was among the Philistines, who were aliens from the commonwealth
of Israel, afar off from God and his law, and from righteousness; and
when David was there, he was at a distance from his native country, his
father's house, the king's court, and, what gave him most concern, from
the house and worship of God; and here he was as a mute dove. He may be
compared to a dove for his innocence in the case of Saul; and to a silly
dove, for his acting the part of a fool or madman before Achish king of
Gath; and was mute to what the servants of Achish said, and was dumb
before the Lord, who had suffered him to fall into their hands, and into
this distress he was now in. They are also applicable to Christ, who is
comparable to a dove for his harmlessness, innocence, meekness and
humility; and was as a mute one before Pontius Pilate the Roman
governor, when his enemies accused him, and he answered not a word; and
when among the Roman soldiers, who mocked at him and reviled him, and he
reviled not again; and when he was led to be crucified, he opened not
his mouth either against God or man. They may be also applied to the
church of God, which is often called a dove in [Sol
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md); and is in the wilderness, and
among wicked men, that are afar off from God, and is silent under all
afflictions and persecutions; see [Sol
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md). The Targum paraphrases the words
thus;

"concerning the congregation of Israel, which is like to a silent dove,
at the time they are removed afar off from their cities.''

Moreover, the words may be applied to any truly gracious soul, that is
sensible of sin, and mourns as a dove for it; has fled to Christ, as
doves to their windows; and is harmless and humble; and living among
men, aliens from God, is vexed and afflicted by them, yet patiently
bears all that is said and done unto it. The fact which occasioned the
writing of this psalm is related in [Sa1
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md). Of the word "michtam", See Gill
on [Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001), title; and Gussetius (o.md)
is of opinion, that every psalm that has this title belongs to Christ.

[Psalms 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 56:1</span></span>

Be merciful unto me, O God,.... For David could expect no mercy at the
hands of men, among whom he was, whose tender mercies were cruel; he
being at Gath, the city of Goliath, whom he had slain, and whose sword
he had now with him; and among his brethren and friends, who he might
justly fear would revenge his death upon him: wherefore he betakes
himself to God, and pleads not any merit or righteousness of his own,
but implores the grace and mercy of God; and he might expect to find
grace and mercy in this his time of need, since there is mercy with the
Lord; he is plenteous in it, distributes it freely, delights in so
doing, and does it constantly; his mercy endures for ever, it is from
everlasting to everlasting on them that fear him;

for man would swallow me up; the Targum renders it "isbi", a wicked man:
it may be understood of some one man, some great man, as Achish king of
Gath; or rather Saul king of Israel, who breathed and panted after his
ruin and destruction, as the word (p), signifies; who sought to eat up
his flesh, to take away his life, and utterly ruin him: or collectively
of many, since it appears, by the following verse, that he had many
enemies who were desirous to swallow him up. This he mentions as an
aggravation of his distress, and as a reason why he hoped the Lord would
be merciful to him; and that he, being God, would not suffer than to
prevail; see [Ch2 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#012.md);

he fighting daily oppresseth me; this shows that Saul is more especially
intended, who was continually with his army pursuing him, and sometimes
surrounded him and his men, and reduced him to great distress. This may
be applied to the old man, the corruptions of nature, and the lusts of
the flesh, which are continually warring against the soul, oppress it,
bring it into captivity, and threaten to swallow it up.

[Psalms 56:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 56:2</span></span>

Mine enemies would daily swallow me up,.... For not one man only, but
many, were his enemies; who observed and watched him, and were eagerly
desirous of his ruin. The believer has many enemies, sin, Satan, and the
world, seeking to devour and destroy him, though they cannot;

for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High; he appeals to
God, who dwells on high, and sees all things, for the truth of this,
that he had many enemies both at Gath and in Israel; as well as applies
to him for help, he being higher than they. Some render the words, "for
they be many that fight against me from on high" (q), or "highly" (r),
proudly and haughtily. Aben Ezra gives a very different sense,

"I have many angels on high that fight for me.''

But "marom", is an epithet of God, as in [Psa
92:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008.md); and so it is interpreted by
Jarchi and Kimchi; and also by the Targum, which renders it, O God most
High; and adds,

"whose throne is on high;''

which is approved by Gussetius (s).

vers. and Michaelis. (r) "Elato animo", Musculus; so some in Vatablus;

[Psalms 56:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 56:3</span></span>

What time I am afraid,.... It was a time of fear with him now; he was
afraid of Achish king of Gath, [Sa1
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#012.md); so believers have their times
of fear; about their interest in the love, and grace, and covenant of
God; about their sins and corruptions, and the prevalence of them,
fearing they shall perish by them; and about their enemies, who are
many, lively, and strong;

I will trust in thee; trust and confidence in the Lord is the best
antidote against fears; who is unchangeable in his love, in whom is
everlasting strength, and who is faithful and true to every word of
promise; and therefore there is great reason to trust in him, and not be
afraid.

[Psalms 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 56:4</span></span>

In God I will praise his word,.... Or praise him for his words for the
whole Scripture that was then in being; for those testimonies which were
David's counsellors in times of difficulty and distress; and
particularly for some word of promise made unto him, he was persuaded
would be fulfilled, and in which he gloried and made his boast of, and
on which his faith and hope were built; and this he did, and determined
to do, in the strength of the Lord, and by the assistance of his grace;

in God I have put my trust; either in times past, and was not ashamed or
confounded; or now, as he determined he would in [Psa
56:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#003.md);

I will not fear what flesh can do unto me: or continue to fear any or
all of my enemies; though I have been afraid of them, I will shake off
these fears, trusting in the Lord, and depending on his word. Or, "what
can flesh do unto me?" (t) which is as grass, and the goodliness thereof
as the flower of the field. Poor, frail, mortal man! what can he do
against me, if God be for me? And therefore why should I fear? Men may
contrive schemes, form weapons, and attempt many things against the
saints, but can execute nothing, except permitted by the Lord; and the
utmost they can do, when suffered, is to kill the body.

\(t\) So Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Gejerus, Michaelis.

[Psalms 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 56:5</span></span>

Every day they wrest my words,.... Form, fashion, and shape them at
their pleasure; construe them, and put what sense upon them they think
fit. The word (u) is used of the formation of the human body, in [Job
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008.md); They put his words upon the
rack, and made them speak what he never intended; as some men wrest the
Scriptures to their own destruction, [Pe2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016.md); and as the Jews wrested the
words of Christ, [Joh 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md). The word
has also the sense of causing vexation and grief, [Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010.md); and so it may be rendered here,
"my words cause grief" (w); to his enemies; because he had said, in the
preceding verses, that he would trust in the Lord, and praise his word,
and not be afraid of men; just as the Sadducees were grieved at the
apostles preaching, through Jesus, the resurrection of the dead, [Act
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md). Or they caused grief to himself;
for because of these his enemies reproached him, cursed him, and
distressed him. The Septuagint and Vulgate Latin render it, "they cursed
my words"; or despised them, as the Ethiopic and Arabic versions:

all their thoughts are against me for evil; their counsels, schemes, and
contrivances, were all formed to do him all the hurt and mischief they
could.

\(u\) "fingunt mea verba", Cocceius, Gusset. p. 628. "They painfully
form and frame my words", Ainsworth. (w) "Dolore afficient", Montanus,
Gejerus, Vatablus.

[Psalms 56:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 56:6</span></span>

They gather themselves together,.... And meet in some one place, to
contrive ways and means to do hurt, and then assemble together again to
put them in execution; as did the Jews with respect to Christ, [Mat
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#003.md). Aben Ezra supposes a various
reading without any reason; and that, instead of which Jarchi renders
"they lodge", and the Septuagint, and the versions following that, "they
sojourn", it should be read "they assemble in troops": because they were
many: but the sense is, "they stay" (x), or continue in some certain
place:

they hide themselves; the Targum adds, "in ambush": they lay in wait,
and caused others to lie in wait for him, in order to take him; as did
Saul and his men, and the servants of the king of Gath;

they mark my steps; they observed where he went, that they might seize
him; or they observed his heels, as the old serpent did the Messiah's,
that he might bruise them; or they watched for his halting, as
Jeremiah's familiars did for his;

when they wait for my soul; to take away his life, to destroy him; see
[Psa 119:95](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#095.md); they wanted not a will to
do it, they only waited for an opportunity. The Targum is,

"as they waited, they did to my soul:''

or rather, "after they had hoped for my soul" (y): when they had
entertained hopes of taking him, this animated them to do the above
things.

[Psalms 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 56:7</span></span>

Shall they escape by iniquity?.... Shall such iniquity as this, or
persons guilty of it, go unpunished, or escape righteous judgment, and
the vengeance of God? No; and much less shall they escape by means of
their iniquity; by their wicked subtlety, or by any evil arts and
methods made use of, by making a covenant with death, and an agreement
with hell; or escape because of their iniquity; or be delivered because
of the abominations done by them, as they flatter themselves, [Jer
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010.md). Some understand these words, not
as referring to the escape of David's enemies, but of himself; and
render them, either by way of petition, "because of iniquity", the
iniquity of his enemies before described, "deliver me from them"; or
"deliver them" (z), meaning his heels they marked, and his soul they
waited for: or by way of assertion or interrogation, "because of
iniquity" there shall be; or shall there be "a deliverance to them?" (a)
his heels and his soul; or from them, his enemies. Though others choose
to render the words thus; "because of their iniquity", there shall be "a
casting of them away" (b) by the Lord, and from his presence, with
loathing and contempt, as sons of Belial; reprobate silver, rejected of
the Lord; which agrees with what follows:

in thine anger, cast down the people, O God; Saul's courtiers, or the
servants of Achish king of Gath, or both, who were in high places, but
slippery ones; and such are sometimes brought down to destruction in a
moment, by that God from whom promotion comes; who putteth down one, and
sets up another, and which he does in wrath and anger.

[Psalms 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 56:8</span></span>

Thou tellest my wanderings,.... Not his sins; though these are
aberrations or wanderings from the ways of God's commandments; yet these
are not told by the Lord: he takes no account of them; the number of
them is not kept by him; they are blotted out, cast behind his back, and
into the depths of the sea; though sometimes his people think they are
told and numbered by him, [Job 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#016.md);
but David's moves and flights from place to place are meant, through
Saul's pursuit of him, as a partridge on the mountains. Some writers
reckon twelve of these moves. The Targum renders it,

"thou numberest the days of my wandering;''

that is, the days of his pilgrimage and sojourning in this world: the
number of our days, and months and years, in which we wander about in
this uncertain state of things, is with the Lord, [Job
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#005.md);

put thou my tears into thy bottle; the allusion is to "lachrymatories",
or tear bottles, in which surviving relatives dropped their tears for
their deceased friends, and buried them with their ashes, or in their
urns; some of which tear bottles are still to be seen in the cabinets of
the curious. A description of which is given by Gejerus (c), from Olaus
Wormius; and who also from Cotovicus relates, that the grave of M.
Tullius Cicero was dug up in the island of Zacynthus, A. D. 1544, in
which were found two glass urns; the larger had ashes in it, the lesser
water: the one was supposed to contain his ashes, the other the tears of
his friends: and as this was a custom with the Romans, something like
this might obtain among the Jews; and it is a saying with them (d),

"whoever sheds tears for a good man (deceased) the holy blessed God
numbers them, and puts them into his treasures, according to [Psa
56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008.md);''

which shows, that they thought that reference is here had to funeral
tears. The meaning of the text is, that God would take notice of David's
afflictions and troubles, which had caused so many tears, and remember
them, and deliver him out of them: these being desired to be put into a
bottle was, that they might be kept and reserved; not to make atonement
for sin; for as a thousand rivers of oil cannot expiate one sin, could
they be come at; so neither as many rivers of brinish tears, could they
possibly be shed: nor to obtain heaven and happiness; for there is no
comparison nor proportion between the sufferings of the saints and the
glory that shall be revealed in them; though there is a connection of
grace through the promise of God between them: but rather, that they
might be brought forth another day and shown, to the aggravation of the
condemnation of wicked men, who by their hard speeches, and ungodly
actions, have caused them;

are they not in thy book? verily they are; that is, the tears and
afflictions of his people. They are in his book of purposes; they are
all appointed by him, their kind and nature, their measure and duration,
their quality and quantity; what they shall be, and how long they shall
last; and their end and use: and they are in his book of providence, and
are all overruled and caused to work for their good; and they are in the
book of his remembrance; they are taken notice of and numbered by him,
and shall be finished; they shall not exceed their bounds. These tears
will be turned into joy, and God will wipe them all away from the eyes
of his people.

[Psalms 56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 56:9</span></span>

When I cry unto thee,.... In prayer;

then shall mine enemies turn back; great is the strength of prayer; the
effectual fervent prayer of the righteous avails much against their
enemies: when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel prevailed: the cases of
Asa, Jehoshaphat, and Hezekiah, prove it; this David was assured of, and
knew it to be true by experience, his prayer being often the prayer of
faith in this respect;

this I know: for God is for me; he knew that when he prayed his enemies
would flee; because God was on his side, who is greater than they; or by
this he knew that God was for him, and was his God, by hearing his
prayers, and causing his enemies to turn back: or, however, let things
go how they will, this he was assured of, that he had a covenant
interest in God, and who would be his God and guide even unto death.

[Psalms 56:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 56:10</span></span>

In God will I praise his word,.... These words are repeated from [Psa
56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md); and for the greater certainty of
the thing, and to show his fixed resolution to do it, and his strong
affection for the Lord and his word, they are doubled;

in the Lord will I praise his word: in the former clause the word
"Elohim" is made use of, which, the Jews say, denotes the property of
justice, and in the latter Jehovah, which with them is the property of
mercy; and accordingly the Targum paraphrases the words,

"in the attribute of the justice of God will I praise his word; in the
attribute of the mercies of Jehovah will I praise his word;''

and to the same sense Jarchi: that is, whether I am in adversity or
prosperity, receive evil or good things from the hand of the Lord; yet
will I praise him: I will sing of mercy and of judgment, [Psa
101:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001.md); or rather the one may denote
the grace and goodness of a covenant God in making promises, and the
other his truth and faithfulness in keeping them; on account of both
which he is worthy of praise. The word "his" is not in either clause in
the original text, and they may be rendered, "in God will I praise the
word; in the Lord will I praise the word": in and by the help,
assistance, and grace of Jehovah the Father, will I praise the eternal
and essential Word, his Son. The Targum renders it his "Memra"; a word
often used in it for a divine Person, the eternal Logos; the loveliness
of his person, the love of his heart to his people, the fulness of grace
that is in him, the offices he sustains on their account, and the virtue
of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, render him praiseworthy in
their esteem.

[Psalms 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 56:11</span></span>

In God have I put my trust,.... See Gill on [Psa
56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md);

I will not be afraid what man can do unto me; the same with flesh in
[Psa 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md), and is opposed to God, in
whom he trusted; and it suggests that he was not, and would not, be
afraid of the greatest of men, as well as of the meanest; See Gill on
[Psa 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md); Arama distinguishes between
"flesh" and "man"; the former, he says, means the Philistines, and the
latter Saul and his army.

[Psalms 56:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 56:12</span></span>

Thy vows are upon me, O God,.... Which he had made to him in the time of
his distress and trouble, and which he looked upon himself under
obligation to perform; they were debts upon him he ought to pay off;
they were with him; they were fresh in his mind and memory; he had not
forgot them, which is often the case when trouble is over; and he found
his heart inclined to make them good;

I will render praises unto thee; which explains what he meant by his
vows; namely, sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving to the Lord: when he
was in distress, he had vowed and promised, that, if the Lord would
deliver him, he would praise his name, and give him all the glory; and
now he resolves to fulfil what he had promised.

[Psalms 56:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 56:13</span></span>

For thou hast delivered my soul from death,.... From imminent danger of
death, when in the hands of the Philistines; not that the soul can die;
that is immortal; but he means his person, on which account he
determines to render praise to God: moreover, this may include the
deliverance of his soul from a moral or spiritual death, in which he was
by nature, being conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity; from which he
was delivered by regenerating grace, when he was quickened, who before
was dead in trespasses and sins; and so delivered, as that this death
should no more come upon him; the grace of God in him being a well of
living water, springing up unto eternal life: and it may also be
understood of deliverance from eternal death, by Christ, who has
redeemed his people from the curse of the law, and delivered them from
wrath to come; so that they shall never be hurt of the second death;
that shall have no power over them; but they shall have eternal life;
all which is matter of praise and thanksgiving;

wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling? that is, "thou wilt deliver"
them; for this way of speaking strongly affirms; or "hast thou not
delivered them?" (e) thou hast; and wilt still deliver, or keep from
falling. The people of God are subject to falling; God is the only
keeper of them; and they have reason to believe that he will keep them
from a final and total filling away; because of the great love which he
has for them, the gracious promises of preservation he has made unto
them, and his power, which is engaged in keeping of them; and because
they are put into the hands of Christ, who is able to keep them, and who
has an interest in them, and an affection for them; and because of the
glory of all, the three divine Persons concerned in the saints'
preservation; and this is another reason for rendering praises unto the
Lord; the end of which follows;

that I may walk before God in the light of the living; to "walk before
God" is to walk as in his sight, who sees and knows all hearts,
thoughts, words, and actions; with great circumspection, and caution,
and watchfulness; to walk according to the word and will of God, in all
his ways, commands, and ordinances; and so the Arabic version, "that I
may do the will of the Lord"; and so as to please him, as Enoch did, who
walked with him, and whose walking with him is interpreted by pleasing
him, [Heb 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005.md); agreeably to which the
Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, render the
words, "that I may please before the Lord"; or do what is acceptable in
his sight. Moreover, to walk before the Lord is to walk in the light of
his countenance, to have his presence, enjoy his favour, and be blessed
with communion with him. "In the light of the living?" that is, to walk
as an enlightened and quickened person, as the children of the light;
and to walk in the light of the Gospel, and as becomes that; and to walk
in Christ the light, and by faith on him; and such shall have "the light
of life", [Joh 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md); a phrase the same
with this here; and designs the light of the heavenly glory, and of the
New Jerusalem church state, in which the nations of them that are saved
shall walk, [Rev 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023.md). Some Jewish
(f) writers interpret this of paradise.
