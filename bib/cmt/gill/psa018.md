INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 18

To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David. This is the same with that in
[Sa2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#001.md), with some variations,
omissions, and alterations:

the servant of the Lord; not only by creation, nor merely by
regeneration, but by office, as king of Israel, being put into it by the
Lord, and acting in it in submission and obedience to him; just as the
apostles under the New Testament, on account of their office, so style
themselves in their epistles:

who spake unto the Lord the words of this song; that is, who delivered
and sung this song in so many express words, in public, before all the
congregation of Israel, to the honour and glory of God:

in the day \[that\] the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his
enemies, and from the hand of Saul, Not that this psalm was composed and
sung the selfsame day that David was delivered from Saul, and set upon
the throne; for it seems to have been written in his old age, at the
close of his days; for immediately after it, in the second book of
Samuel, it follows, "now these be the last words of David", [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md), but the sense is, that whereas
David had many enemies, and particularly Saul, who was his greatest
enemy, the Lord delivered him from them all, and especially from him,
from him first, and then from all the rest; which when he reflected upon
in his last days, he sat down and wrote this psalm, and then sung it in
public, having delivered it into the hands of the chief musician for
that purpose. There are two passages cited out of it in the New
Testament, and applied to Christ; [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md), in [Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md), and [Psa
18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049.md) in [Rom
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md); and there are many things in it
that very well agree with him; he is eminently the "servant" of the Lord
as Mediator; he was encompassed with the snares and sorrows of death and
hell, and with the floods of ungodly men, when in the garden and on the
cross God was his helper and deliverer, as man; and he was victorious
over all enemies, sin, Satan, the world, death and hell; as the subject
of this psalm is all along represented: and to Christ it does most
properly belong to be the head of the Heathen, whose voluntary subjects
the Gentiles are said to be, [Psa
18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043.md); and which is expressed in much
the same language as the like things are in [Isa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md); which is a clear and undoubted
prophecy of the Messiah; to which may be added, that the Lord's
Anointed, the King Messiah, and who is also called David, is expressly
mentioned in [Psa 18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050.md); and which is
applied to the Messiah by the Jews (q) as [Psa
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032.md) is paraphrased of him by the
Targum on it;

and he said; the following words:

\(q\) Echa Rabbati, fol. 50. 2. & Midrash Tillim in Tzeror Hammor, fol.
47. 3.

[Psalms 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 18:1</span></span>

I will love thee, O Lord, my strength. These words are not in twenty
second chapter of Second Samuel: the psalm there begins with [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md). The psalmist here expresses his
love to the Lord, and his continuance in it; that Jehovah the Father
was, is, and ever will be the object of Christ's love, is certain; and
which has appeared by his readiness in the council and covenant of grace
to do his will; by his coming down from heaven to earth for that
purpose; by his delight in it, it being his meat and drink to do it; and
by his sufferings and death, which were in compliance with, and
obedience to it, [Joh 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#031.md); and as in
David, so in all regenerate ones, there is love to God; Jehovah is loved
by them in all his persons; Jehovah the Father is loved, and to be
loved, for the perfections of his nature, because of the works of his
hands, of creation and providence; and particularly because of his works
of special grace and goodness, and especially because of his love
wherewith he has loved his people, [Jo1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019.md). Jehovah the Son is loved, and to
be loved, above all creatures and things whatever, sincerely and
heartily, fervently and constantly; because of the loveliness of his
person, the love of his heart, and his works of grace and redemption;
all of him is lovely; and he is to be loved, and is loved, in his
person, offices, relations, people, word, and ordinances: Jehovah the
Spirit is loved, and to be loved, because of his person and perfections,
and operations of grace; as a sanctifier, comforter, the spirit of
adoption, the earnest and pledge of eternal glory. The word here used
signifies the most intimate, tender, and affectionate love; it often
designs mercy and bowels of mercy; so Aben Ezra interprets it of seeking
mercy of God: the reasons are as follow in this verse and [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md), because "the Lord is my
strength"; so he was to Christ as man, who as such was the man of his
right hand, the Son of Man, whom he made strong for himself, to do his
work, and for his glory, [Psa 80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md);
he promised to strengthen him, and he did, [Psa
89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021.md); and so he is the strength of
all his saints, even Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit; he is the
strength of their hearts both in life and at death; he is the strength
of their graces, who strengthens that which he has wrought for them, and
in them; he strengthens them to do their duty, to bear the cross, and
every affliction, and against every enemy of their souls; and this
renders him very lovely and amiable to them.

[Psalms 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 18:2</span></span>

The Lord is my rock,.... To whom the saints have recourse for shelter
and safety, for supply, support, and divine refreshment; and in whom
they are secure, and on whom they build their hopes of eternal life and
happiness, and so are safe from all enemies, and from all danger. Christ
is called a Rock on all these accounts, [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md);

and my fortress; or garrison; so the saints are kept in and by the power
of God as in a garrison, [Pe1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md);

and my deliverer: out of all afflictions, and from all temptations, and
out of the hands of all enemies; from a body of sin and death at last,
and from wrath to come;

my God; the strong and mighty One, who is able to save, and who is the
covenant God and Father of his people;

my strength, in whom I will trust; as Christ did, and to whom these
words are applied in [Heb 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md); and as
his people are enabled to do even under very distressing and
discouraging circumstances, [Job
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015.md);

my buckler; or shield; who protects and defends them from their enemies,
and preserves them from the fiery darts of Satan;

and the horn of my salvation; who pushes, scatters, and destroys their
enemies, and saves them; a metaphor taken from horned beasts; so Christ,
the mighty and able Saviour, is called, [Luk
1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069.md);

and my high tower; such is the name of the Lord, whither the righteous
run and are safe, [Pro 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md); and
where they are above and out of the reach of every enemy; see [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016.md); in [Sa2
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#003.md), it is added, "and my refuge, my
Saviour, thou savest me from violence". These various epithets show the
fulness of safety in Jehovah, the various ways he has to deliver his
people from their enemies, and secure them from danger; and the psalmist
beholding and claiming his interest in him under all these characters,
rendered him exceeding lovely and delightful to him; and each of them
contain a reason why he loved him, and why, in the strength of grace, he
determined to love him. God may be regarded in all these characters by
Christ as man.

[Psalms 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 18:3</span></span>

I will call upon the Lord,.... In prayer, for fresh mercies, and further
appearances of himself, and discoveries of his grace and favour;

who is worthy to be praised; for the perfections of his nature, the
works of his hands, his providential goodness, and more especially for
his covenant grace and blessings in Christ. The Targum is,

"in praise, or with an hymn, I pray before the Lord;''

agreeably to the rule the apostle gives, [Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md); and this prayer was a prayer of
faith, as follows;

so shall I be saved from mine enemies: which was founded upon past
experience of God's goodness to him in distress, when he called upon
him, as the next words show.

[Psalms 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 18:4</span></span>

The sorrows of death compassed me,.... These words and the following, in
this verse and [Psa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md), as they
respect David, show the snares that were laid for his life, the danger
of death he was in, and the anxiety of mind he was possessed of on
account of it; and as they refer to Christ, include all the sorrows of
his life to the time of his death, who was a man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief personally, and bore and carried the sorrows and
griefs of all his people; and may chiefly intend his sorrows in the
garden, arising from a view of the sins of his people, which he was
about to bear upon the cross; and from an apprehension of the wrath of
God, and curse of the law, which he was going to sustain for them, when
his soul was encompassed about with sorrow, even unto death, [Mat
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038.md); when his sorrow was so great,
and lay so heavy upon him, that it almost pressed him down to death, he
could scarce live under it; and may also take in the very pains and
agonies of death; he dying the death of the cross, which was a very
painful and excruciating one; see [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md); The Hebrew word for "sorrows"
signifies the pains and birth throes of a woman in travail; and is here
fitly used of the sufferings and death of Christ; through which he
brought forth much fruit, or many sons to glory. The Targum is,

"distress has encompassed me, as a woman that sits upon the stool, and
has no strength to bring forth, and is in danger of dying.''

In [Sa2 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#005.md), it is "the waves" or
"breakers of death compassed me"; and the word there used is rendered in
[Hos 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md); "the breaking forth of
children"; moreover the same word signifies "cords" (r), as well as
pains and sorrows; and the allusion may be to malefactors being bound
with cords when led to execution, and put to death; and may here signify
the power of death, under which the Messiah was held for a while, but
was loosed from it at his resurrection; to which sense of the word, and
to the words here, the Apostle Peter manifestly refers, [Act
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024.md);

and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; meaning either the
multitude of them, as Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Roman soldiers, and
people of the Jews, who all gathered together against him; so the Targum
renders it, "a company of wicked men"; or the variety of sufferings he
endured by them; as spitting upon, buffering, scourging, &c. The word
rendered "ungodly men is Belial"; and signifies vain, worthless, and
unprofitable men; men of no figure or account; or lawless ones, such as
have cast off the yoke of the law, are not subject to it; persons very
wicked and profligate. The word in the New Testament seems to be used
for Satan, [Co2 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015.md); where it is so
rendered in the Syriac version, and he may be designed here; and by the
floods of Belial may be meant, not so much the temptations of Satan in
the wilderness, as his violent and impetuous attacks upon Christ in the
garden, when being in an agony or conflict with him, his sweat was, as
it were, great drops of blood, [Luk
22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044.md). The Septuagint render the word,
"the torrents of iniquity troubled me"; which was true of Christ, when
all the sins of his people came flowing in upon him, like mighty
torrents, from all quarters; when God laid on him the iniquity of them
all, and he was made sin for them; and in a view of all this "he began
to be sore amazed", [Mar 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#033.md);
compare with this [Psa 69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md). Arama
interprets Belial of the evil imagination in David, who had a war in
himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 18:5</span></span>

The sorrows of hell compassed me about,.... Or "the cords of the grave"
(s), under the power of which he was detained for awhile; the allusion
may be to the manner of burying among the Jews, who wound up their dead
bodies in linen clothes; so that they were as persons bound hand and
foot; and thus were they laid in the grave; see [Joh
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#044.md); and so was Christ, till he was
raised from the dead, when he showed himself to have the keys of hell
and death, and to be no more under their power, or be held by them;

the snares of death prevented me; or "met" or "got before me" (t) the
sense is, he was taken in them: this phrase designs the insidious ways
and methods which the enemies of Christ took to ensnare him, and take
away his life, and in which they succeeded; see [Mat
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 18:6</span></span>

In my distress I called upon the Lord,.... The great Jehovah, the
everlasting I AM, who is the most High in all the earth, and who is able
to save, [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md);

and cried unto my God; as Jesus did, [Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md); so the members of Christ, when
in distress, as they often are, through sin and Satan, through the
hidings of God's face, a variety of afflictions, and the persecutions of
men, betake themselves to the Lord, and call upon their God: a time of
distress is a time for prayer; and sometimes the end God has in
suffering them to be in distress is to bring them to the throne of his
grace; and a great privilege it is they have that they have such a
throne to come to for grace and mercy to help them in time of need, and
such a God to sympathize with them, and help them; and their
encouragement to call upon him, and cry unto him, is, that he is
Jehovah, omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent; who knows their wants,
is able to help them, and is a God at hand to do it;

He heard my voice out of his temple; that is, out of heaven his dwelling
place; for the temple at Jerusalem was not built in David's time; and it
may be observed, that the prayer of the psalmist, or whom he represents,
was a vocal one, and not merely mental; and hearing it intends a
gracious regard unto it, an acceptance of it, and an agreeable answer:
for it follows,

and my cry came before him, even into his ears; God did not cover
himself with a cloud, that his prayer could not pass through; but it was
admitted and received; it came up before him with acceptance; it reached
his ears, and even entered into them, and was delightful music to them:
see [Joh 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#041.md).

[Psalms 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 18:7</span></span>

Then the earth shook and trembled,.... As it did quickly after Christ
called upon the Lord, and cried to his God upon the cross, [Mat
27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050.md); and so some time after, when
his people were praying together, the place where they were assembled
was shaken, [Act 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031.md); as a token of
God's presence being with them: and the shaking and trembling of the
earth is often used as a symbol of the presence of God, and of the
greatness of his majesty; as when he brought the children of Israel
through the Red sea, went before them in the wilderness, and descended
on Mount Sinai, which mountain then moved and quaked exceedingly; see
[Psa 104:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032.md); and it is easy to
observe, that in this, and other parts of this majestic account of the
appearance of God on the behalf of the person the subject of this psalm,
and against his enemies, there are manifest allusions to the giving of
the law on Mount Sinai; though it may be this shaking of the earth, and
what follows, are to be understood in a figurative sense;

the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken; and design the
shaking of the earth and heavens, prophesied of in [Hag
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md); and which is explained in [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md); of the removing the ordinances
of the ceremonial law, that Gospel ordinances might remain unshaken; for
in [Sa2 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#008.md); the words are, "the
foundations of heaven moved and shook"; and the shaking and moving of
the earth and mountains may denote the abolition and destruction of
kingdoms and nations; and first of the civil polity of the Jews, and of
their ecclesiastical state, which quickly ensued upon the death of
Christ; and next of the ruin of Rome Pagan, and then of Rome Papal;
which are both signified by an earthquake, and by the removal of
mountains, [Rev 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012.md);

because he was wroth; with the people of the Jews, for disbelieving and
rejecting the Messiah; for setting themselves, and taking counsel
together against him, and putting him to death; for these things God was
angry with them, and wrath came upon them to the uttermost, and their
nation, city, and temple were destroyed, [Psa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md); and with the Pagan empire and
antichristian powers, [Rev 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 18:8</span></span>

There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,.... This, with what follows,
describes a storm of thunder; the "smoke" designs thick black clouds,
gathered together; "fire" intends lightning; and "coals of fire", hot
thunderbolts; and the whole is borrowed from, and is an allusion to what
was at the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, [Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md); The majesty of God is here set
forth in much such language as is the leviathan in [Job
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#019.md); the "smoke of his nostrils"
seems to intend the indignation of God against the enemies of David, of
Christ, and of his people, and the punishment be will inflict upon them,
[Isa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#005.md). The Targum interprets it of
the pride and insolence of Pharaoh;

and fire out of his mouth devoured; God is a wall of fire round about
his people, and a consuming one to his and their enemies. This expresses
the wrath of God upon the Jewish nation, and his sending the Roman
armies to burn their city, [Mat 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007.md);

coals were kindled by it; the Jews being as dry trees, were fit fuel for
the fire of divine wrath, and so presently became as coals of fire; so
the antichristian party, upon the pouring out of the fourth vial, will
be scorched with heat, and blaspheme the name of God, [Rev
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 18:9</span></span>

He bowed the heavens also, and came down,.... To execute wrath and
vengeance on wicked men; which is always the sense of these phrases when
they go together; see [Psa 144:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#006.md); The
Targum is, "he bowed the heavens, and his glory appeared"; that is, the
glory of his power, and of his mighty hand of vengeance; for not his
grace and mercy, but his indignation and wrath, showed themselves; for
it follows,

and darkness was under his feet; the Targum is, "a dark cloud",
expressive of the awfulness of the dispensation to wicked men; who are
not allowed to see the face of God, are debarred his presence, and
denied, communion with him, and to whom everything appears awful and
terrible, [Psa 97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 18:10</span></span>

And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly,.... The Targum renders it in the
plural number, "cherubim"; and so the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic
versions; and by whom may be meant, either the angels, who are as horses
and chariots, on whom Jehovah rides, and who art he makes use of as
executioners of his wrath and vengeance, [Zac
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005.md); and to whom wings are assigned as
a token of swiftness, [Isa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md); or
rather the ministers of the Gospel, who are the living creatures in [Rev
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#007.md); and answer to the "cherubim" in
Ezekiel's visions; and whom God made use of, especially after the death
of Christ, and when the Gospel was rejected by the Jews, to carry it
into the Gentile world, which was done by them with great speed and
swiftness; and Maimonides (u) gives a caution, not to understand the
phrase, "he did fly", as of God, but of the cherub;

yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind; which may design the speedy
help and assistance God gave to his Son, and gives to his people; and
the swift destruction of their enemies; see [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md); the words in [Sa2
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#011.md), with only the variation of a
letter in one word, are, "and he was seen upon the wings of the wind";
which were both true; nor need a various reading be supposed, the
psalmist using both words at different times, suitable to his purpose,
and which both express his sense. Wings are ascribed to the winds by the
Heathen poets, and they are represented as winged on ancient monuments
(w).

\(u\) Moreh Nevochim. par. 1. c. 49. (w) Vide Cuperi Apotheos. Homeri,
p. 178. Wings are given to the south wind by Ovid, Metamorph. l. 1. Fab.
7. and by Juvenal, Satyr. 5. v. 10. and by Virgil, Aeneid. 8. v. 430.
and who also speaks of wings of lightning, Aeneid. 5. v. 319.

[Psalms 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 18:11</span></span>

He made darkness his secret place,.... Which, and the dark waters in the
next clause, are the same with the thick clouds in the last, in which
Jehovah is represented as wrapping himself, and in which he lies hid as
in a secret place; not so as that he cannot see others, as wicked men
imagine, [Job 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#013.md); but as that he
cannot be beheld by others; the Targum interprets it,

"he caused his Shechinah to dwell in darkness;''

his pavilion round about him were dark waters, and thick clouds of the
skies; these were as a tent or tabernacle, in which he dwelt unseen by
men; see [Job 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029.md); all this may
design the dark dispensation of the Jews, after their rejection and
crucifixion of Christ; when God departed from them, left their house
desolate, and them without his presence and protection; when the light
of the Gospel was taken away from them, and blindness happened unto
them, and they had eyes that they should not see, and were given up to a
judicial darkness of mind and hardness of heart; which were some of the
dark, deep, and mysterious methods of divine Providence, with respect to
which God may be said to be surrounded with darkness, dark waters, and
thick clouds; see [Rom 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 18:12</span></span>

At the brightness that was before him, The lightning that came out of
the thick clouds; which may denote, either the coming of Christ to take
vengeance on the Jewish nation, which was swift and sudden, clear and
manifest; or the spreading of the Gospel in the Gentile world, in which
Christ, the brightness of his Father's glory, appeared to the
illumination of many; see [Mat 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027.md);
and both may be intended, as the effects following show;

his thick clouds passed; that is, passed away; the gross darkness, which
had for so many years covered the Gentile world, was removed when God
sent forth his light and truth; and multitudes, who were darkness
itself, were made light in the Lord;

hail stones and coals of fire; the same Gospel that was enlightening to
the Gentiles, and the savour of life unto life unto them, was grievous,
like hail stones, and tormenting, scorching, irritating, and provoking,
like coals of fire, and the savour of death unto death, to the Jews;
when God provoked them, by sending the Gospel among the Gentiles, and
calling them: or these may design the heavy, awful, and consuming
judgments of God upon them, which are sometimes signified by hail
storms; see [Rev 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#007.md). In [Sa2
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#013.md), it is only, "through the
brightness before him were coals of fire kindled".

[Psalms 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 18:13</span></span>

The Lord also thundered in the heavens,.... By his apostles and
ministers, some of which were Boanergeses, sons of thunder, whose
ministry was useful to shake the consciences of men, and bring them to a
sense of themselves, [Mar 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md);

and the Highest gave his voice; the same with thunder; for thunder is
often called the voice of the Lord, [Job
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#005.md); compare with this [Psa
68:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011.md); the Targum interprets it, "he
lifted up his word"; the same effects as before follow,

hail stones and coals of fire; See Gill on [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 18:14</span></span>

Yea, he sent out his arrows,.... By which thunderbolts, cracks of
thunder, and flashes of lightning, seem to be meant; see [Psa
77:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#017.md); comparable to arrows shot, and
sent out of a bow; and may denote, either the doctrines of the Gospel,
which were sharp in the hearts of Christ's enemies, and are either the
means of subduing them to him, or of destroying them, being the savour
of death unto death; or however, like arrows, give great pain and
uneasiness where they stick, and grievously distress and torment; as
does the fire which comes out of the mouth of the two witnesses, [Rev
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#005.md). The Targum is,

"he sent his word as arrows;''

or else the judgments of God are meant, as famine, pestilence, and the
sword, which God sent unto, and spent upon the Jewish nation, [Deu
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#023.md);

and scattered them; among the nations of the world, where they have been
dispersed ever since;

and he shot out lightnings; or "many lightnings", so the Targum:

and discomfited them; troubled, terrified, and distressed them.

[Psalms 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 18:15</span></span>

Then the channels of water were seen,.... Or, "of the sea"; as in [Sa2
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#016.md). There seems to be an allusion
to the drying up of the sea when the Israelites passed through it. Aben
Ezra interprets this of the discovery of the secrets of enemies, and of
their deep schemes and counsels, which they seek to hide, but are made
known by him who sees all things in the dark; and so the following
clause;

and the foundations of the world were discovered; but it rather seems to
intend the utter extirpation and ruin of the Jewish nation, both in
their civil and ecclesiastic state, the foundation of which was rooted
up and laid bare; unless with Jerom we understand this of the ministers
of the word, in whom the doctrines of grace were channelled, and who
were as fountains of water; and of the foundation of the apostles and
prophets made known in the Gospel: but the former sense is best; since
it follows,

at thy rebuke, O Lord; at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils; for
the destruction of the Jews was the effect of divine wrath and
vengeance: so ends the account of the wonderful appearance of God in
favour of the person the subject of this psalm, and against his enemies;
the deliverance wrought for him is next described.

[Psalms 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 18:16</span></span>

He sent from above,.... Either his hand, as in [Psa
144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md); he exerted and displayed his
mighty power in raising Christ from the dead; or he sent help from his
sanctuary; as in [Psa 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002.md); and helped
and strengthened him in a day of salvation; or when he wrought out the
salvation of his people; or "he sent his word", as in [Psa
107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md); his word of command, to take
up his life again, as he had given it to lay it down, [Joh
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018.md). The Targum is, he sent his
prophets; but it may be much better supplied, he sent his angels, or an
angel; as he did at his resurrection, who rolled away the stone from the
sepulchre, as a token of his justification and discharge: so Jarchi
interprets it, he sent his angels; and Aben Ezra supplies it thus,

"he sent his word or his angel:''

unless the sense should be, as Cocceius suggests, he sent a cloud from
above, which was done at Christ's ascension, and which received him out
of the sight of the apostles, [Act
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009.md). Since it follows,

he took me; that is, up to heaven; thither Christ was carried in a
cloud, one of God's chariots, he sent for him; and where he is received,
and will be retained until his second coming; though rather the sense
is, he took me by the hand:

he drew me out of many waters. This is said either in allusion to Moses,
who had his name from his being drawn out of the water, [Exo
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#010.md); and who was an eminent type of
Christ; and this is the only place where the Hebrew word is made use of
from whence he had his name; or else to a man plunged in water ready to
be drowned; see [Psa 69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md). By these
"many waters" may be meant the many afflictions, sorrows, and sufferings
from which Christ was freed, when raised from the dead, and highly
exalted and crowned with glory and honour; and the torrent of sins which
flowed in upon him at the time he was made sin for his people, from
which he was justified when risen; and so will appear a second time
without sin unto salvation; and the wrath of God, the waves and billows
of which went over him, and compassed him about as water, at the time of
his sufferings; from which he was delivered when he was shown the path
of life, and entered into the presence of God, and sat at his right
hand, where are joys and pleasures for evermore; and also his grand
enemy Satan, with his principalities and powers, who came in like a
flood upon him; but he destroyed him and spoiled them; and particularly
the floods of ungodly men, spoken of in [Psa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md); seem to be here designed;
compare with this [Psa 144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md); "so many
waters" signify many people and nations, [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md); and accordingly the Targum is,

"he delivered me from many people.''

This was true of Christ when risen and ascended; he was then separate
from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; and this sense is
confirmed by the following words, where what is expressed figuratively
here is there literally explained.

[Psalms 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 18:17</span></span>

He delivered me from my strong enemy,.... Which, as it may respect
David, may be understood of Goliath the Philistine champion, who was a
man of war from his youth; or Saul, king of Israel; and, as it may
respect David's antitype, may design either the chief priests, Scribes,
and Pharisees, who were men of power and influence; or more especially
Satan, the strong man armed, with all his principalities and powers; or,
likewise death, the last enemy, from whose pains and cords he was loosed
when raised from the dead, and when he was delivered from every other
strong enemy;

and from them which hated me; from the old serpent the devil, between
whom and him there has been a lasting enmity; and from the world, the
people of the Jews, particularly the Pharisees, who bore an implacable
hatred to Christ;

for they were too strong for me; as Goliath and Saul were too strong for
David of himself, so Christ's enemies were too strong for him; not as
God, for he is the mighty God, the Almighty, and stronger than the
strong man armed, but as man; for in his human nature he had a sinless
weakness, which showed itself in his agonies in the garden; or a natural
weakness, through which he was crucified; and this weak nature of Christ
Satan attacked, and got an advantage over, and brought it to the dust of
death, which is meant by his bruising his heel, though by it he got a
broken head. But though Christ's enemies were too strong for him,
considered merely as man, they not being, at least many of them, flesh
and blood, but principalities and powers; yet being helped by his
Father, and supported by his divine nature, he overcame them, and was
delivered from them.

[Psalms 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 18:18</span></span>

They prevented me in the day of my calamity,.... Referring to the times
of his distress in the garden and upon the cross; the time of his
sufferings and death, which was a dark and cloudy day, as the word (x)
used suggests, both in a literal and in a spiritual sense; and when the
day and hour was come, fixed and determined by the will of God, then his
enemies, though not before, met him, laid hold on him, were too mighty
for him, condemned, crucified, and insulted him;

but the Lord was my stay; or staff, on whom he leaned, relied, and
depended, believing he would help him; and by whom he was supported and
upheld, [Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md). The Targum is,

"the Word of the Lord was my stay.''

[Psalms 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 18:19</span></span>

He brought me forth also into a large place,.... Into heaven, a place of
the glorious liberty of Christ, after his captivity to death and the
grave, whither he ascended leading captivity captive, and of the
children of God; and a spacious place, where there is room enough for
Christ and all his people; here he now is, and will remain till his
second coming, and from hence we expect him; see [Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md). Compare with this [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md);

he delivered me, because he delighted in me; God delivered David from
all his enemies, because he was a man after his own heart, in whom he
delighted; not for any merit and worthiness in him, but of his good will
and pleasure: he delivered Christ because he was his elect, in whom his
soul delighted; and who was daily his delight, rejoicing in his presence
before the world was: and he delivers his church and people, because
they are his Hephzibah, in whom is his delight, [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md); the Father delighted in them,
and therefore chose them to salvation; the Son delighted in them, and
gave himself for them, and ransomed them out of the hands of him that is
stronger than they; the Holy Spirit delighted in them, and therefore
regenerates, renews, and sanctifies them, and seals them up unto the day
of redemption.

[Psalms 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 18:20</span></span>

The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness,.... Which, if
applied to David, cannot be understood of his own personal
righteousness, or of works of righteousness done by him, for these merit
nothing at the hand of God; no reward, in strict justice, is due to
them, or given to them: a man's own righteousness is imperfect, and by
the law of God is not accounted a righteousness; and it is unprofitable
to God, is no gain to him, and so not rewardable by him; and were it
perfect, it is but man's duty, and what God has a prior right to, and so
is not recompensed by him; though it is so far from being pure and
perfect, that it is attended with much sin, and is no other than rags,
and filthy ones, which can never recommend a person to God; it is what
will not bear the sight of God, and can never be called cleanness in his
eyesight: by it no man is justified before him; and though God does,
indeed, reward the works of his people, which are fruits of his grace,
yet the reward is not of debt, but of grace. This, therefore, must be
understood of the righteousness of David's cause, and of his innocence
with respect to the things he was charged with by his enemies; of his
righteousness towards Saul; and of "the cleanness of his hands", in not
defiling them with his blood, when it was in his power to take away his
life; therefore God rewarded him by delivering him out of his hands, and
setting him upon the throne, and causing his kingdom to flourish and
prosper; for this respects temporal blessings, and not eternal glory and
happiness; and is something that had been and was then enjoyed, and not
anything future, or in another world: though it is best of all to apply
it to Christ, and understand it of his righteousness, which he, as
Mediator, has wrought out for his people; this is perfect, pure, and
spotless, and entirely agreeable to the law of God; what will bear the
sight of God, is satisfying to his justice, is well pleasing to him, and
is what he accepts of, and imputes to them that believe in Christ, and
by which they are justified from all things. Now, according to this
righteousness, Christ in strict justice has been rewarded in his own
person; as he had the work of man's redemption assigned him, and he
agreed to do it, he had a reward promised him, and which he claimed,
when he had glorified his Father and finished his work; and which he
received when he was set down at the right hand of God, crowned with
glory and honour, in consequence of his obedience, sufferings, and
death; see [Phi 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md); and he is
rewarded in his members according to his righteousness, they being
justified by it, and made heirs of eternal life on account of it, and
are or will be glorified with him for evermore;

according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me; which
signifies the same thing.

[Psalms 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 18:21</span></span>

For I have kept the ways of the Lord,.... Not those which the Lord
himself walks in, his ways of providence, or of grace; though these are
and should be taken notice of and observed by good men, as the word (y)
used will bear to be rendered; but the ways which he has prescribed and
directed men to walk in, the ways of his commandments, in which they
should go; these were, in some measure, kept by David, who often, in the
hundred nineteenth psalm speaks of his keeping the testimonies and
statutes, and commandments of the Lord; as they are by good men, with
some degree of pleasure, they take delight to walk in them; and with
some degree of constancy, they keep walking in them, without turning to
the right hand or the left, though solicited to it; but yet not
perfectly, for they have many a slip and fall in them; wherefore this
cannot be a reason of their being rewarded according to their
righteousness: in strict justice, the words better agree with Christ,
who kept the law of God perfectly, did his will completely; he came from
heaven to do it; it was his meat and drink to accomplish it; and he
always did the things which pleased his father, wherefore he rewarded
him;

and have not wickedly departed from my God; which was, in some sense,
true of David; not as by disbelieving the power and providence, the
promises, truth, and faithfulness of God, and his covenant interest in
him; which to do would have been a wicked departure from God; see [Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012.md); nor by forsaking the house and
worship of God; though he was driven from thence by wicked men, yet sore
against his will, and which during his exile he frequently laments and
complains of; nor by sinning wilfully and presumptuously, only through
error, inadvertency, infirmity, and temptation: but when it is observed,
how much unbelief, which is a partial departing from the living God, and
how many there are that neglect private and public worship, and what a
proneness there is to sin and wickedness, and how much there is of the
will in sinful actions, in the best of men; it is right and best to
understand this of Christ, who never was guilty of sin, nor committed
any wickedness in departing from God in the least: as man, God was his
God, and he always believed his interest in him, and claimed it even
when he forsook him on the cross; nor did he quit his service, desert
his cause, nor depart from the work and business he enjoined him, till
it was finished.

[Psalms 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 18:22</span></span>

For all his judgments were before me,.... That is, the precepts of the
law of God, which David had a respect unto, loved, took delight and
pleasure in, and so had them all in his sight, and made them the rule of
his actions; and the law of God is delighted in by regenerate persons,
after the inward man; and though it is abolished as a covenant of works,
it is a rule of walk and conversation to the saints; and as such they
keep it in view, and regard it impartially, not only some of its
precepts, but all. This in the highest and fullest sense was done by
Christ, who was made under the law, in whose heart it was, and who came
to fulfil it, and has completely fulfilled it;

and I did not put away his statutes from me; in [Sa2
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#023.md); it is read, "and as for his
statutes, I did not depart from them"; the sense is the same; this may
have respect to the ceremonial law, and the ordinances of it, which
David abode by, very strictly observed, renewed, and put in order; and
which Christ, his antitype, never departed from, but conformed unto
throughout the whole of his life; witness his circumcision, keeping of
the passover, attendance on the synagogue and temple worship; nor did he
put them away until they had their full accomplishment in him; when
there was a disannulling of them because of their weakness and
unprofitableness.

[Psalms 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 18:23</span></span>

I was also upright before him,.... In heart and conversation, being
sincere and faithful; so David was in the sight of God; but this is much
more true of Christ, in whom there was no unrighteousness nor guile,
neither in his heart, nor in his lips; he was of perfect integrity, and
faithful in all things to him that appointed him;

and I kept myself from mine iniquity; which some interpret of original
sin, in which David was born, which dwelt in him, and prompted him to
sin; but rather it refers to the taking away of Saul's life, which he
might be tempted to do, as being his enemy that sought his life; and
which he was put upon and urged to by some about him, and yet did it
not. But it is best here also to apply these words to Christ; for though
he had no iniquity of his own, yet he had the iniquities of his people
on him, as their surety, and which he calls "mine", [Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md). But though he bore them, he did
not commit any of them; though he was made sin, he knew none; and though
he was tempted by Satan to the most enormous iniquities, as destroying
himself and worshipping the devil, he kept himself from the evil one,
that he could not touch him: the sense is, that he kept himself from
committing any sin, which cannot be said of any mere man; and so far as
good men are kept from sin, they are kept by the power of God, and not
by themselves. All these things show, that the righteousness of Christ
was a perfect, sinless one, entirely agreeable to the laws, statutes,
and judgments of God; was pure in the sight of God, and rewardable in
strict justice. Hence it is repeated as follows:

[Psalms 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 18:24</span></span>

Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my
righteousness,.... Having proved and supported this proposition by the
above reasons, it is repeated, for confirmation's sake;

according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight; this phrase, "in
his eyesight", is here added, to show that the righteousness of Christ
was clean, pure, and spotless in the sight of God; in the eye of divine
justice: hence those that are clothed with it are holy and unblamable,
and irreprovable in his sight, [Col
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md).

[Psalms 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 18:25</span></span>

With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful,.... The merciful man
is the good, gracious, holy, and godly man, as the word (z) here used
signifies, and is sometimes rendered; one that has received grace and
mercy from the Lord, and has principles of grace and goodness wrought in
him, and is kind and merciful to others, both to their souls and bodies;
and to such men God shows himself merciful: not that they are first
merciful to others, and then he is so to them, for it is just the
reverse; nor is their mercifulness the cause or condition of his, for he
has mercy on whom he will have mercy; but to such he shows fresh mercy,
and bestows more grace upon them; they find grace and mercy with him
now, and will do hereafter; see [Mat
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007.md). This may be applied to Christ,
all whose ways are mercy and truth; he saw the estate his people would
come into; he pitied their case, and became their surety in eternity; he
betrothed them to himself in loving kindness and tender mercies; and
undertook to feed the flock of slaughter, even the poor of the flock;
having, through his merciful lovingkindness, assumed human nature, he
went about doing good to the souls and bodies of men; he healed the
diseased and fed the hungry, and had compassion on the ignorant, and
them that were out of the way; and, as a merciful high priest, he bore
the sins and sorrows of his people; and in his love and pity redeemed
them, and continues to sympathize with them in all their afflictions and
temptations; and though no mercy was shown him while he was suffering
for them, for God spared him not, but awoke the sword of justice against
him, and used him with the utmost rigour and severity; yet satisfaction
being made, he did not leave him in the grave, nor suffer his holy,
good, and merciful One to see corruption; but raised him from the dead,
prevented him with the blessings of his goodness, and set upon his head
a crown of honour and glory;

with an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright; an upright man, as
the word (a) used signifies, is a perfect man, not absolutely, but
comparatively; not in himself, but in Christ; perfect with a perfection
of parts, but not of degrees; he is one that is upright in heart,
sincere and without hypocrisy; an Israelite indeed, whose faith, hope,
and love, are undisguised; he is a man of integrity, a faithful man,
faithful to God, his cause and interest, his word and ordinances, and is
faithful with the saints; he walks, uprightly according to the rule of
God's word, and by faith in Christ; and to such upright men God shows
himself upright, or faithful, by keeping his covenant with them,
fulfilling his promises to them, and not suffering one good thing to
fail he has given them reason to expect from him. This may also be
interpreted of Christ, who is in the highest and fullest sense perfect,
upright, and sincere, and faithful to him that appointed him; and as he
has been faithful in all his covenant engagements with his Father, so
his Father has been faithful to him in making good all he promised him;
both with respect to his own glory, and the happiness of his people; see
[Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 18:26</span></span>

With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure,.... None of Adam's posterity
are pure by nature; they are all defiled with sin; and though some are
pure in their own eyes, they are far from being cleansed from their
filthiness; such only are pure who are sanctified by the Spirit of God,
have clean hearts created in them, and whose hearts are purified by
faith in the blood of Christ; who are justified by Christ's
righteousness, and are washed from their sins in his blood; and who, in
consequence of such grace, love, pureness of heart, speak a pure
language, hold the mystery of faith in a pure conscience, and with a
pure conversation, and live soberly, righteously, and godly: and whereas
God is a pure and holy Being, his perfections, works, and word, are
pure; he shows himself to be so to such persons, by providing for the
honour of his purity and holiness in their redemption, sanctification,
and salvation; by making all things to be pure to them; by granting them
his presence, and blessing them with the vision of himself here and
hereafter; see [Mat 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008.md); this may
likewise be understood of Christ, who, in his human nature, is pure from
all sin, both original and actual: he indeed took upon him the sins of
his people, and bore them, and made satisfaction for them, and brought
in everlasting righteousness; which being done, God has showed himself
pure to him, by justifying, acquitting, and discharging him from all
such sins; by accepting his righteousness, and imputing it to those for
whom he wrought it;

and with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward; or "thou wrestlest"
(b), or wilt contend with them until they are destroyed: the same word
is here used which Naphtali has his name from, [Gen
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#008.md). The froward are such as are of
perverse dispositions, and of stubborn and obstinate tempers, and whose
ways are crooked and distorted; and such were the people of the Jews in
the times of Moses, and of Christ, [Deu
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md); and who seem here to be
designed; even the Jews in Christ's time, who were just the reverse of
the above characters, were cruel and unmerciful, faithless and
hypocritical, filthy and pure, disbelieved the Messiah, rejected and
crucified him, were contrary to God, and to all men; and therefore God
walked contrary to them, as he threatened, [Lev
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#027.md); the same as showing himself
froward to them; for God is not froward and perverse in himself, nor in
his ways, which are all equal, just, and pure: and though there is one
and the same word used in our version, yet there are two different words
in the Hebrew text; the same word that is used of the froward is not
used of God; that which is used of God, as before observed, signifies
wrestling, and designs God's contending with the people of the Jews, in
a way of wrath and fury, which came upon them to the uttermost, and
issued in their entire ruin as a people and nation; the words here had
their fulfilment in the destruction of Jerusalem.

[Psalms 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 18:27</span></span>

For thou wilt save the afflicted people,.... As the people of God
commonly are; they are afflicted with sin, and the corruption of their
own hearts, and with Satan and his temptations, and with the world, its
reproaches, and persecutions; but God in his own time saves them out of
them, if not here, yet hereafter. This is particularly and eminently
true of the Christians who lived between the crucifixion of Christ and
the destruction of Jerusalem; who were greatly afflicted and persecuted
by the Jews, but were in a remarkable manner saved a little before the
destruction of Jerusalem, by being directed to go out of it to a place
called Pella (c); so that not one Christian suffered in it;

but wilt bring down high looks; or proud men, whom God humbles; these he
abhors, resists, sets himself against, scatters and destroys. The Jews
were a very proud people, and behaved in an insolent and insulting
manner towards Christ and his followers; but the high looks of the chief
priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, were brought down to a purpose, when
their city, temple, and nation, were destroyed; see [Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md).

For thou wilt light my candle,.... Or lamp (d): in [Sa2
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#029.md), it is, "Thou art my lamp, O
Lord"; which may either design outward prosperity, and the flourishing
condition of David's kingdom; or internal spiritual light, and an
increase of it, by giving fresh supplies of the oil of grace, to cause
the lamp to burn more clearly; or rather the prosperous estate of
Christ's kingdom; and may be the same with the lamp ordained for the
Messiah, [Psa 132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md);

the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness; or "cause light to shine in
my darkness" (e); that is, bring me out of darkness into light; either
out of adversity to prosperity, or from walking in darkness to the
enjoyment of the light of his countenance; and is true of Christ, not
only of the prosperity of his kingdom and interest, but of him
personally; who though, when on the cross, was in darkness of soul,
being forsaken by his God; yet, when raised from the dead, he was
received up to heaven, and set down at the right hand of God, and was
made full of joy with his countenance, [Act

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 18:29</span></span>

For by thee I have run through a troop,.... Or, "I have run to a troop":
to meet one (f) with courage and intrepidity, as some interpret it (g);
or, as others (h), "I have run after a troop": that is, pursued after
one, as David pursued after the troops of the Amalekites who burnt
Ziklag, [Sa1 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#008.md); to which Jarchi
refers this passage; or rather, "I have broke a troop", or "through one"
(i); for the word, as some Jewish writers (k) observe, comes from a root
which signifies to "break" in pieces, and is fitly used for the
destroying or cutting in pieces a troop of the enemy; and is true of
Christ, when he engaged with the troops of hell, and broke the squadrons
of the infernal fiends, and spoiled or disarmed principalities and
powers, and triumphed over them on the cross, and made a show of them
openly, when he dragged them at his chariot wheels, and led captivity
captive;

and by my God have I leaped over a wall; which refers to the scaling of
walls, and taking of fortified places; and so the Targum, "By the word
of my God I will subdue fortified towns"; so Apollinarius has it, passed
over a tower, or took it; which was literally true of David, in many
instances. Jarchi applies this to his taking the fortress of Zion from
the Jebusites: a learned writer (l) thinks this refers to his leaping
over the city wall, and slipping through the city watch, when Michal let
him down through a window: it may be applied to Christ, who broke down
the middle wail of partition, the ceremonial law, which stood between
Jew and Gentile; or rather it may design the many difficulties which
were in the way of the salvation of his people, which he surmounted and
got over with great strength and swiftness; such as fulfilling the law,
satisfying justice, bearing sin, and making atonement for it, undergoing
a shameful and an accursed death, and grappling with numerous enemies,
whom he conquered; and he is said to do all this by his God; because, as
man and Mediator, he was strengthened and assisted by him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 18:30</span></span>

As for God, his way is perfect,.... Or "without spot" (m), as the
Septuagint render the word; without any just charge of inequality, or
unrighteousness; such is God's way of providence, though sometimes his
methods of providence are cavilled at by wicked men, and murmured at by
his own people: they are at a loss, at times, to reconcile promises and
providences together, and to account for the justice and equity of them;
these ways of his are unsearchable, and not to be traced out by them;
but when his judgments will be made manifest, the wisdom, goodness, and
righteousness of them will be clearly discerned, and they will be
admired; for they are all of a piece, and perfectly consistent with the
attributes of God: and such also is his way of grace, and method of
salvation; it is agreeable to all his perfections, and according to his
purposes, counsel, and covenant; this being resolved on in his breast,
contrived by his wisdom, and concluded on in the covenant, has been
effected and finished by his son; and his inward way of working upon the
heart, though at present imperfect, will be completed; he is a rock, and
his work is perfect, and all his ways are judgment: whatever way or
method he contrives and enters upon, whether in providence or grace, he
pursues and brings to an issue; for he is an omnipotent, omniscient, and
unchangeable Being, and neither frustrates, nor is he frustrated; nor is
there any insincerity, unrighteousness, and unfaithfulness in him; nor
can he act contrary to himself, and the perfections of his nature: the
way also which he prescribes to others is perfect and plain, whether the
path of doctrine or of duty; the path of truth is plain to the
enlightened understanding, and the way of holiness is such, in which
men, though fools, shall not err; see [Pro
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#008.md);

the word of the Lord is tried; as silver in a furnace, and is clear of
all dross, of error, and falsehood; is free from human mixtures, and
without any impurity and unholiness; nor is God's word of promise
chargeable with unfaithfulness; all his promises being yea and amen in
Christ, and have been tried and proved by the saints in all ages; and
have been found true, faithful, constant, and invariable;

he is a buckler to all those that trust in him; not in man, nor in
themselves; in their own righteousness, or in any creature or creature
enjoyment or performance; but in the providence and power of God, in his
grace and mercy, in his word, and especially in his Son; in his person,
blood, and righteousness; to such he is a buckler or shield: his power
is all around them, his favour encompasses them, and his truth, or
faithfulness in his word, is their shield and buckler: and so is his
Son, who is both a sun and shield to them; and such are his precious
blood, his spotless righteousness, and stoning sacrifice; which, being
held up by faith, repel the fiery darts of Satan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 18:31</span></span>

For who is God save the Lord?.... Or Jehovah: there is but one God, and
Jehovah is he; there is none besides him, nor any like him: there are
many that are called gods, nominal deities, who are not by nature gods;
fictitious ones, the idols of the Gentiles, made of gold, silver, brass,
wood, and stone; but there is but one true God: there are gods, in an
improper sense, as civil magistrates; but there is none really and truly
so but the Lord; which is to be understood, not of Jehovah the Father,
to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit; for the Son is Jehovah, and the
Spirit is Jehovah; both are so called, as well as the Father, and all
three one God;

or who is a rock save our God? to have recourse to for shelter and
protection; or to trust to, and build upon, for eternal life and
salvation. False gods are rocks; but not like ours, our enemies
themselves being judges, [Deu 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031.md);
so Apollo at Delphos is called the Delphian rock (n): the words seem to

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 18:32</span></span>

It is God that girdeth me with strength,.... For battle, as in [Psa
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039.md); with strength of body and
fortitude of mind; both which are from the Lord, and were in David; and
were acknowledged by him as bestowed on him by the Lord; and which
confirms what he had before said of him: or with spiritual strength,
with strength in his soul, against sin, Satan, and the world; and to do
the will and work of God: saints are girt by the Lord with the whole
armour of God, and among the rest with the girdle of truth; and are
prepared and ready to every good work; see [Sa1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#004.md). Hannah's song is again referred
to: in [Sa2 22:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#033.md), the words are, "God
is my strength and power"; they are true of Christ, the man of God's
right hand, whom he promised to strengthen, and whom he has made strong
for himself, [Psa 80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md);

and maketh my way perfect; or safe, or prosperous. God removed every
impediment and obstacle out of his way, and made it plain and easy, as
Jarchi observes; and succeeded him, and gave him victory over his
enemies; this has been verified in Christ, who has conquered sin, Satan,
the world, death, and the grave: for this is not to be understood of the
way and course of David's life and conversation, which was not perfect
and unspotted, but had many blemishes and imperfections in it, which he
often owns, confesses, and bewails.

[Psalms 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 18:33</span></span>

He maketh my feet like hind's feet,.... As light and swift as theirs, as
the Targum; that is, either to flee, when there was a necessity for it,
as Kimchi observes; or rather to pursue after the enemy, to run through
a troop, and leap over a wall, as before; see [Ch1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md); the same phrase is used in [Hab
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019.md); and may be understood in a
spiritual sense of that readiness and cheerfulness with which the saints
run the ways of God's commandments, when their hearts are enlarged with
his love and grace; and may very well be applied to Christ, who is often
compared to a roe, or a young hart, for swiftness; who readily and at
once engaged to come and do the will of God, and whose coming in the
flesh, at the appointed time, was swift; and who made haste to do the
work of God, in which he took the utmost pleasure; and who is a speedy
and present help to his people in time of trouble; see [Sol
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md);

and setteth me upon my high places; the towers and fortresses, and
strong and fortified places, where he was safe from his enemies; and: in
a spiritual sense, may design the everlasting love of God, the covenant
of grace, its blessings and promises; and Christ himself, with the
fulness of grace in him, on which believers may be said to be set, when
their faith is directed to them, and they live and dwell upon them; see
[Hab 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019.md); and, the words were
fulfilled in Christ, when God highly exalted him at his right hand, and
set him above all principalities and powers, and made him higher than
the heavens.

[Psalms 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 18:34</span></span>

He teacheth my hands to war,.... From whence it appears, that war, in
some cases, is lawful; and that all the skilfulness and art in training
men for war, in the use of armour, in marshalling of armies, in forming
sieges, &c. is all from God; see [Psa
144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md); and so is all that spiritual
skill, in making use of the whole armour of God against every enemy,
sin, Satan, and the world; and even the wisdom and skill, counsel and
instruction, which Christ as man and Mediator had, when it was the hour
and power of darkness; when he was engaged with principalities and
powers, and got the victory over them, were from the Lord: see [Psa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md);

so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms; that is, the bow of an
enemy falling into his hands, which might be literally true of David. It
is in the Hebrew text, "a bow of brass"; and so Apollinarius renders it;
which Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret strong iron, that is, steel; and
so the Targum; see [Job 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md); Satan
is an archer; his temptations are darts, and fiery ones; and his strong
bow may be said to be broken by the arms of faith, when his temptations,
under the influence of divine grace, are repelled and rendered
ineffectual; and especially his bow was broken by Christ, not only in
the wilderness, when he was vanquished by him; but in the garden, and on
the cross, when Satan could find nothing in him, and get no other
advantage over him, but to bruise his heel; when he himself had his head
broke, his works ruined, and he himself destroyed. Some render the
words, "mine arms have bent a bow of steel": that is, such skill and
strength were given him that he was able to bend, draw, and shoot a bow
or steel: the Targum is, "and hath strengthened mine arm as a bow of
brass", or "steel"; and so the Syriac and Arabic versions; and to the
same purpose the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions; or it
may be rendered, "my arms have bent", or "made to descend (o), a bow of
brass"; for when a bow is bent, the horns or corners of it are made to
descend towards a man.

[Psalms 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 18:35</span></span>

Thou hast given me the shield of thy salvation,.... Meaning either
temporal salvation, which was a shield to him when he had no outward
one, as when he fought with Goliath; and was what preserved him in all
his battles at other times: or spiritual salvation, which is of the
Lord, of his contriving, effecting:, and applying, and in which his
glory is concerned; interest in which is a free gift of his, as are the
knowledge, application, and possession of it; and this is as a shield,
which saves from sin, from all sin, and the damning power of it; keeps
off the curses of the law, secures from wrath to come, and repels
Satan's temptations; the words may be applied to Christ, who, though he
was not saved from dying, yet was preserved in the day of salvation, and
was not suffered to see corruption in the grave, and was quickly
delivered from the power and dominion of it;

and thy right hand hath holden me up; Christ may be said to be the right
hand of God, being as dear to him as his right hand; and being exalted
at it; and because by him he communicates all good things to his people,
and with him upholds and sustains them; or else it designs the mighty
power of God, which is often signified by it, [Psa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md); and may be understood of the
sustentation of David, both in a providential way, with respect to his
being, the preservation of it, the supplies of life, and support in
times of trouble and distress; and in a spiritual sense, maintaining the
principle of grace in him, furnishing him with fresh supplies of grace,
and bearing him up under and through every temptation and exercise; so
upholding him that he stood firm in the true grace of God, in the
exercise of it implanted, and in the doctrine of grace, so as to go
forward in the ways of God, and follow hard after him, and so as not to
fall and utterly perish; and which is true of all the saints; see [Psa
63:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#008.md). The words may be interpreted of
Christ, who, as man and Mediator, as God's righteous servant, was upheld
by him, so that he failed not, nor was he discouraged; the hand of the
Lord was established with him, and his arm also strengthened him, [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); this clause is not in [Sa2
22:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#036.md);

and thy gentleness hath made me great; David was very mean and low by
his birth and occupation, and while persecuted by Saul; but God of his
grace and goodness, of his sovereign good will and pleasure, raised him
to an high estate, set him on the throne of Israel, and gave him honour
among and above the kings of the earth; so Kimchi interprets the word
for "gentleness" by "goodness" or "merciful" kindness; R. Jonah by
"providence"; and R. Isaac explains it "thy help and good will"; and all
shows that his greatness was not owing to his merits, but to the
providential goodness of God; and his special grace and mercy in Christ
Jesus made him still greater, even a child of God, an heir of God, a
joint heir with Christ, a King and a Priest unto God; gave him a right
unto and a meetness for a crown of glory, an everlasting kingdom, an
eternal inheritance, as it does all the saints. The words may be
rendered, "thy humility hath made me great" (p); which may be understood
either of God's humbling himself to look upon him in his low estate, and
to raise him to such honour and dignity as he did, both in a temporal
and spiritual sense; see [Psa 113:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006.md);
or of the humility which he had in himself from God, as Aben Ezra
interprets it; of which grace God is the author; it is a fruit of the
Spirit; which he takes great notice of, gives more grace to them that
have it, and exalts them, as he did David, who was mean and low in his
own eyes. The Septuagint, and those versions which follow that, render
it "thy discipline" or "correction": and so may design the gentleness
and lenity of God in chastising his people, which is always in measure
and in judgment, and for their good; whereby he increases grace in them,
and trains them up for, and brings them to his kingdom and glory. The
Chaldee paraphrase is, "by thy word thou hast increased me"; it may not
be improperly interpreted of Christ, who was very low in his estate of
humiliation on earth, but is now highly exalted, and crowned with glory
and honour; who first endured great sufferings, and then entered into
his glory.

Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,.... Which is opposed to those
straitened circumstances in which the psalmist was, [Psa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md); and is expressive of deliverance
from his enemies, by whom he was surrounded, besieged, and shut up; see
[Psa 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md); and of freedom of walking
at large, without being straitened for room, or interrupted by others,
[Pro 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#012.md); and of safety in standing;
all which is true in a spiritual sense of believers in Christ, who being
delivered by him out of the hands of their enemies, serve the Lord
without fear in righteousness and holiness; walk at liberty by faith in
Christ, and up and down in the name of the Lord their God; and have
their feet established upon the Rock of ages, that sure and large
foundation, Christ, from which there is no danger of slipping and
falling; as follows;

that my feet did not slip; so as to fall and perish; for sometimes the
steps of the saints are well nigh slipped; yea, in some sense they
stumble; slip, and fall, but not so as to be utterly cast down and
perish eternally; the bottom on which they are is so broad, and the
foundation so sure, that it is not possible they should. The words will
bear to be applied to Christ, who was in very pressed and straitened
circumstances, when beset with the bulls of Bashan, encompassed with
dogs, and enclosed with the assembly of the wicked; and was in slippery
places, when he sunk in deep mire where there is no standing, [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md); but now being delivered from
all this, he is brought, as in [Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md), into a large place, into
heaven, and made higher than the heavens, and is set down at the right
hand of God, from whence he can never be moved.

David's pursuing the Amalekites, who overtook them and recovered all
they had carried away, [Sa1 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#008.md); so
Kimchi explains it;

neither did I turn again till they were consumed; for not a man escaped,
save four hundred young men that rode on camels and fled, [Psa

[Psalms 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 18:38</span></span>

I have wounded them, that they were not able to rise,.... Which was not
only true of the Amalekites, but of all with whom David engaged in war;

they are fallen under my feet; either dead, or become subject and
tributaries to him; as the Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, and Edomites;
see [Sa2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md). This, with [Psa
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#037.md), may very well be accommodated
to David's antitype, and be expressive of the entire victory he has
obtained over all his and his people's enemies; he wounded the heads
over many countries, [Psa 110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006.md). Satan
and his principalities and powers, whose head is broke, whose works are
destroyed; yea, he himself, which had the power of death, so as not to
be able to rise more against Christ, who has led captivity captive: he
has also finished and made an end of sin, and overcome the world; nor
did he turn back from this work he engaged in until he had made a
complete conquest; and moreover he has likewise made his people more
than conquerors, through him, over these same enemies; so that the words
are also applicable to them.

[Psalms 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039.md)

and valour, which David had, were from the Lord; and so is the Spirit of
power, love, and of a sound mind, which believers have; and likewise
that strength which Christ, as man, had and used in his combat with the
powers of darkness; see [Psa 80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md);

thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me; as the
psalmist ascribes his strength, so he attributes his success to the
Lord; who likewise subdues the sins of his people, and all other enemies
of theirs, and who also makes the enemies of his Son his footstool, [Psa

Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies,.... Either to slay
them, or to trample or put a yoke upon them; or rather the sense is,
thou hast made them to fly before me, to turn their necks or backs unto
me, as the word is used in [Jos 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#008.md);
and it is expressive of an utter rout and vanquishing of them;

that I might destroy them that hate me; they not being able to face him
and stand against him.

[Psalms 18:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">psa 18:41</span></span>

They cried, but there was none to save them,.... It is in [Sa2
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#042.md); "they looked"; that is, they
looked round about, here and there, to see if there were any near at
hand to help and deliver them; they cried in their distress, and because
of the anguish of their spirits, and for help and assistance, but in
vain; they cried, as Jarchi thinks, to their idols, as Jonah's mariners
cried everyone to their god; and, if so, it is no wonder there was none
to save; for such are gods that cannot save: but it follows,

even unto the Lord, but he answered them not; as Saul, for instance,
[Sa1 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006.md); so God deals with wicked
men, often by way of righteous retaliation; see [Pro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028.md).

[Psalms 18:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">psa 18:42</span></span>

Then did I beat them small, as the dust before the wind,.... They being
given up by God, and he not answering to their cries; the phrase denotes
the utter ruin and destruction of them, and represents their case as
desperate and irrecoverable; being, as it were, pounded to dust, and
that driven away with the wind: just as the destruction of the four
monarchies is signified by the iron, clay, brass, silver, and gold,
being broken to pieces, and made like the chaff of the summer threshing
floor, and carried away with the wind, so that no place is found for
them any more, [Dan 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035.md);

I did cast them out as the dirt of the streets; expressing indignation
and contempt: in [Sa2 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#043.md); it is, "I
did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did, spread them abroad";
which also denotes the low and miserable condition to which they were
reduced, and the entire conquest made of them, and triumph over them;
see [Isa 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md); compare with this [Sa2
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md).

[Psalms 18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">psa 18:43</span></span>

Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people,.... In [Sa2
22:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#044.md), it is read "my people", meaning
the people of Israel; either Saul and his men, who contended with David,
and sought his life; or rather the tribes of Israel, who, after Saul's
death, refused to acknowledge David as their king, but afterwards came
and anointed him in Hebron. The words may very well be interpreted of
the contentions of the Scribes and Pharisees with Christ, and of the
opposition from sinners, which he for a while endured, but is now
delivered from them all;

and thou hast made me the head of the Heathen; which, if understood of
David, refers to the Philistines, Syrians, Moabites, and Edomites, being
subdued by him, and becoming tributaries to him, [Sa2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md). But it best agrees with Christ,
who is the head of his chosen ones among the Gentiles; the political
head, King, and Governor of them, the Heathen being given him for his
inheritance and possession; and which appeared in the first ages of
Christianity, when the Gospel was first preached to the Gentiles by the
apostles; and still continues, and will be more clearly seen in the
latter day, when the Lord shall be King over all the earth. Christ was
made the head of the Heathen, by the appointment and designation of his
Father; and, in fact, was so when multitudes from among the Gentiles
were converted and brought to the obedience of him. In [Sa2
22:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#044.md) it is, "thou hast kept me to be
head of the Heathen"; which does not seem so much to intend the
designation and constitution of him as such, but the continuation of
him; and denotes the stability of his government in the Gentile world,
of which there will be no end;

a people whom I have not known shall serve me; by whom are meant the
Gentiles, who were not the people of God, were without Christ and
without God, and without hope in the world: not that there are any
people that can be unknown to Christ, as he is the omniscient God; nor
were these unknown to him, in such sense as reprobates, nominal
professors, and foolish virgins, are said not to be known by him, [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023.md). For these people among the
Heathen, who are or shall be brought to serve the Lord, are such who
were the objects of his love and delight from everlasting; were in his
Father's choice and in his own, and in the gift of his Father to him,
and in the covenant of his grace; and therefore must be known by him;
moreover, they are the purchase of his blood; and the sheep he knows,
for whom he has laid down his life, and of whom he has such an exact and
particular knowledge, that he can and does call them by name. But the
sense is, these seemed not to be taken notice of and cared for by
Christ; they were not owned and acknowledged by him as his people; the
Jews were distinguished from all others; they only had the law, the word
of God, and his ordinances; the Gentiles were suffered to walk in their
own ways; they were neglected, and the times of their ignorance were
overlooked and disregarded; so that they were treated as a people that
were not known for many hundreds of years: but here it is predicted,
that when the Gospel should come among them, and they be called by it,
they should "serve" the Lord in righteousness and true holiness, with
reverence and godly fear, from a principle of love, in his name and
strength, and to his glory; see [Isa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 18:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">psa 18:44</span></span>

As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me,.... That is, as soon as
they should hear of Christ, through the preaching of the word, by which
faith would come, they should readily and at once receive, embrace, and
profess the Gospel, and yield a cheerful submission to the ordinances of
it; and which has had its accomplishment among the Gentiles, [Act
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#028.md);

the strangers shall submit themselves unto me; meaning either the same
persons as before; the Gentiles, who were aliens from the commonwealth
of Israel, and strangers to the covenant of promise, who should submit
to Christ, to his Gospel, to his righteousness, and to the sceptre of
his kingdom; though some interpret it of the degenerate Jews, "the sons
of the stranger", as the words may be rendered; who, though called the
children of God, and the children of the kingdom, yet were, as our Lord
says, of their father the devil; and these, some of them, in a
flattering and dissembling way, feigned themselves to be the followers
and disciples of Christ: and, indeed, it looks as if hypocrites were
intended, whether among Jews or Gentiles, or both, since the word here
used, and rendered "submit", signifies to "lie"; and so it is in the
metaphrase of Apollinarius; or, as in the margin of some Bibles, to
"yield a feigned obedience"; see [Psa
66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003.md). There seems to be an allusion to
the conquest of nations, some of the inhabitants of which readily and
heartily submit, but others only feignedly, and through fear, and the
force of superior power they cannot withstand.

[Psalms 18:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">psa 18:45</span></span>

The strangers shall fade away,.... Like the leaves of trees in autumn,
when they fall and perish; to which hypocrites and nominal professors
are compared, [Jde 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012.md);

and be afraid out of their close places; their towers and fortified
places, or the rocks and mountains to which they betake themselves for
shelter; but, as not thinking themselves safe enough, through fear and
dread, come out of them; see [Mic
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#017). Some Jewish writers (q.md)
interpret the words, they shall halt or be lame; that is, because of the
chains put upon their feet: and so they are expressive of the conquest
made of them. The word in the Arabic language signifies to "come out";
and may be so rendered here, and "come out": in [Sa2
22:46](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#046.md); it is, "they shall gird
themselves", or "come out girt".

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">psa 18:46</span></span>

The Lord liveth, and blessed be my Rock,.... This, with what follows, is
the concluding part of the psalm, which ends with a celebration of the
Divine Being, and with thankfulness for mercies received from him. The
psalmist praises him on account of what he is in himself, what he was to
him, and had done for him: in himself he is the living God, "the Lord
liveth": he has life in himself, essentially, originally, and
independently; and is the fountain and author of life to all others,
even to all creatures that have life, whether rational or irrational: he
is the giver of natural life to all men, and the supporter of it; and of
spiritual and eternal life to his chosen people; and he continues to
live, and ever will; wherefore the saints may conclude that their life
in every sense is safe and secure. Some render the phrase, by way of
wish, "may the Lord live" (r); but then it must be understood only that
he would show himself more abundantly to be the living God, and that he
might be acknowledged so by others. The next clauses are by way of
petition; "and blessed be my Rock"; on which he was built and
established, to which he betook himself in times of distress, which was
his place of defence, and from whence he had a supply; wherefore he
desires he might be blessed, not by invoking or conferring a blessing on
him, neither of which can be; there being none greater than he to call
upon, and he being "Elshaddai", God all sufficient, and in no need of
any; but by declaring his blessedness, by celebrating his greatness and
goodness, and by ascribing blessing and honour and glory to him;

and let the God of my salvation be exalted; God was the God of his
salvation in a temporal sense, saving him daily from his many enemies;
and in a spiritual sense, being the contriver, author, and applier of it
to him; on which account he would have him be exalted both by himself,
and in the high praises of his people; ascribing the whole of salvation
to him, and giving him all the glory of it. Some render the words, "the
God of my salvation is high" (s); he is the most high God, the high and
lofty One that inhabits eternity, and is above all others. In [Sa2
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#047.md) the words are read, "and exalted
be the God of the Rock of my salvation".

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">psa 18:47</span></span>

It is God that avengeth me,.... Or "gives vengeance unto me", or "for
me" (t): vengeance only belongs to God, and he repays it for and in
behalf of his people. Private revenge is not to be exercised by any;
public vengeance on delinquents may be exercised by the civil
magistrate, to whom God gives power and authority to exercise it, [Rom
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004.md); as he did to David, as king of
Israel; though the phrase rather seems to design the victories which he
obtained over his enemies, which were punishments to them, vengeances
inflicted on them; and owing to God; so the acceptable year of the
Messiah's coming, and the time of his people redeemed by him, is called
the day of vengeance of our God, both on his and their enemies, [Isa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md);

and subdueth the people under me; the Edomites, Moabites, and others, as
in [Sa2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md), or the Gentiles under
Christ; See Gill on [Psa 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039.md);

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">psa 18:48</span></span>

He delivereth me from mine enemies,.... From Saul and his men, from
Ishbosheth and Abner, from Absalom, and the conspirators with him; so
all believers are delivered out of the hands of their enemies by Christ,
as that they can serve the Lord without fear; and so Christ himself is
delivered from all his enemies, being raised from the dead, and set at
the right hand of God, where he must reign till all enemies are put
under his feet;

yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me; David was
lifted up from a low and mean estate, and placed on the throne of
Israel, above all those that rose up against him, and sought to destroy
him; and the saints are set upon their high places in Christ, where they
are out of the reach of their enemies to do them any harm; and Christ,
he is highly exalted at the right hand of God, above all principality
and power, might and dominion, and every name that is named in this
world;

thou hast delivered me from the violent man; either from Saul, from whom
David was delivered; or from Satan the enemy, the son of wickedness, who
shall no more exact upon and afflict the Messiah, [Psa
89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021.md). The Chaldee paraphrase says,
from Gog; as the saints will be delivered from antichrist, the man of
sin, and son of perdition, who will be destroyed with the breath of
Christ's mouth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">psa 18:49</span></span>

Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Heathen,....
These words are cited by the apostle, in [Rom
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md); and applied to the conversion of
the Gentiles, which is manifestly prophesied of in some preceding verses
of this psalm: there it is rendered, "I will confess to thee among the
Gentiles"; and designs not confession of sin, nor profession of the
truth, but an acknowledgment of unworthiness, joined with thankfulness
for mercies received; done in the most public manner, not only in the
congregation of the righteous, but before the Heathen conquered by him;
owning before them all, that the victories he had obtained over them
were not to be ascribed to his arm and sword, but to the power of the
Lord;

and sing praises unto thy name; which is comely for the saints to do,
and which Jesus Christ himself did, in the great congregation of his
disciples, and among the Gentiles, by his apostles, and others, on the
account of the conversion of them.

[Psalms 18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">psa 18:50</span></span>

Great deliverance giveth he to his king,.... Not that is king over him;
for he is King of kings and Lord of lords; but that is made king by him,
as David was; who did not usurp the throne, but was anointed king by the
appointment of God, and was placed by him upon the throne; to whom he
gave great deliverance from his enemies, or "magnified salvations" to
him; which were great in kind, and many in number; and as Christ is,
whom God has set as his King on his holy hill of Sion, against whom the
Heathen raged, and kings and princes set themselves; but he is delivered
from them all, and saved from the power of death and the grave, and ever
lives to reign over, protect, and defend his people; in [Sa2
22:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#051.md), it is, he is "the tower of
salvation for his king", with which compare [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md);

and showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for
evermore; which may be understood either of David literally, who was the
Lord's anointed, and to whom God showed mercy in various instances; and
then by his seed is meant the Messiah, who was of his seed according to
the flesh; or of the Messiah, whose name signifies Anointed; and who is
often called David, [Eze 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md), [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md); and so some of the Jewish doctors
(u) from this verse prove that the name of the Messiah is David: and by
his seed are meant his spiritual seed; all the elect of God, who are
given him as his children, to whom he stands in the relation of the
everlasting Father: and as mercy is kept with him for evermore, [Psa
89:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028.md); so it is shown to them in
regeneration, in the forgiveness of their sins, and in their everlasting
salvation.
