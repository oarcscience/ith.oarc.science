### [Matthew Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 3:1</span></span>

In those days came John the Baptist,.... The Evangelist having given an
account of the genealogy and birth of Christ; of the coming of the wise
men from the east to him; of his preservation from Herod's bloody design
against him, when all the infants at Bethlehem were slain; of the flight
of Joseph with Mary and Jesus into Egypt, and of their return from
thence, and settlement in Nazareth, where Christ continued till near the
time of his baptism, and entrance on his public ministry; proceeds to
give a brief relation of John, the harbinger and forerunner of Christ,
and the administrator of baptism to him: and he describes him by his
name John, in Hebrew "Jochanan", which signifies "gracious", or "the
grace of the Lord", or "the Lord has given grace"; which agrees with
him, both as a good man, on whom the Lord had bestowed much grace, and
as a preacher, whose business it was to publish the grace of God in
Christ, [Luk 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016.md). This name was
given him by an angel before his conception, and by his parents at his
birth, contrary to the mind of their relations and neighbours, [Luk
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md). He is called by some of the
Jewish writers (m), John the "high priest"; his father Zacharias was a
priest of the course of Abia, and he might succeed him therein, and be
the head of that course, and for that reason be called a "high" or
"chief priest"; as we find such were called, who were the principal
among the priests, as were those who were chosen into the sanhedrim, or
were the heads of these courses; and therefore we read of many chief
priests, [Mat 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004.md). From his being the
first administrator of the ordinance of baptism, he is called John the
Baptist; and this was a well known title and character of him. Josephus
(n) calls him "John", who is surnamed , "the Baptist"; and Ben Gorion
having spoken of him, says (o), this is that John who , "made",
instituted, or practised "baptism"; and which, by the way, shows that
this was not in use among the Jews before, but that John was the first
practiser this way. He is described by his work and office as a
preacher, he "came" or "was preaching" the doctrines of repentance and
baptism; he published and declared that the kingdom of the Messiah was
at hand, that he would quickly be revealed; and exhorted the people to
believe on him, which should come after him. The place where he preached
is mentioned,

in the wilderness of Judea; not that he preached to trees and to the
wild beasts of the desert; for the wilderness of Judea was an habitable
place, and had in it many cities, towns, and villages, in which we must
suppose John came preaching, at least to persons which came out from
thence. There were in Joshua's time six cities in this wilderness,
namely Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah, and Nibshan, and the city of
Salt, and Engedi, [Jos 15:61](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#061.md). Mention
is made in the Talmud (p) of this wilderness of Judea, as distinct from
the land of Israel, when the doctors say, that

"they do not bring up small cattle in the land of Israel, but they bring
them up , "in the wilderness which is in Judea".''

The Jews have an observation (q) of many things coming from the
wilderness;

"the law, they say, came from the wilderness; the tabernacle from the
wilderness; the sanhedrim from the wilderness; the priesthood from the
wilderness; the office of the Levites from the wilderness; the kingdom
from the wilderness; and all the good gifts which God gave to Israel
were from the wilderness.''

So John came preaching here, and Christ was tempted here. The time of
his appearance and preaching was in those days: not when Christ was
newly born; or when the wise men paid their adoration to him; or when
Herod slew the infants; or when he was just dead, and Archelaus reigned
in his room; or when Christ first went to Nazareth; though it was whilst
he dwelt there as a private person; but when John was about thirty years
of age, and Christ was near unto it, [Luk
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023.md) an age in which ecclesiastical
persons entered into service, [Num
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md). It was indeed, as Luke says, [Luk
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md) in the "fifteenth" year of the
reign of Tiberius Caesar; Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea; and
Herod being tetrarch of Galilee; and his brother Philip tetrarch of
Iturea; and of the region of Trachonitis; and Lysanias, the tetrarch of
Abilene; Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests.

[Matthew 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 3:2</span></span>

And saying, repent ye,.... The doctrine which John preached was the
doctrine of repentance; which may be understood either of amendment of
life and manners; for the state of the Jews was then very corrupt, all
sorts of men were grown very wicked; and though there was a generation
among them, who were righteous in their own eyes, and needed no
repentance; yet John calls upon them all, without any distinction, to
repent; and hereby tacitly strikes at the doctrine of justification by
works, which they had embraced, to which the doctrine of repentance is
directly opposite: or rather, this is meant, as the word here used
signifies, of a change of mind, and principles. The Jews had imbibed
many bad notions. The Pharisees held the traditions of the elders, and
the doctrine of justification by the works of the law; and the Sadducees
denied the resurrection of the dead; and it was a prevailing opinion
among them all, and seems to be what is particularly struck at by John,
that the Messiah would be a temporal king, and set up an earthly kingdom
in this world. Wherefore he exhorts them to change their minds, to
relinquish this notion; assuring them, that though he would be a king,
and would have a kingdom, which was near at hand, yet it would be a
heavenly, and not an earthly one. Hence the manner in which John
enforces his doctrine, or the reason and argument he uses to prevail
upon them to regard it, is by saying,

for the kingdom of heaven is at hand: by which is meant not the kingdom
of glory to be expected in another world; or the kingdom of grace, that
is internal grace, which only believers are partakers of in this; but
the kingdom of the Messiah, which was "at hand", just ready to appear,
when he would be made manifest in Israel and enter upon his work and
office: it is the Gospel dispensation which was about to take place, and
is so called; because of the wise and orderly management of it under
Christ, the king and head of his church by the ministration of the word,
and administration of ordinances; whereby, as means, spiritual and
internal grace would be communicated to many, in whose hearts it would
reign and make them meet for the kingdom of glory; and because the whole
economy of the Gospel, the doctrines and ordinances of it are from
heaven. This phrase, "the kingdom of heaven" is often to be met with in
Jewish writings; and sometimes it stands opposed to the "kingdom of the
earth" (r); by it is often meant the worship, service, fear, and love of
God, and faith in him: thus in one of their books (s) having mentioned
those words, "serve the Lord with fear": it is asked, what means this
phrase, "with fear?" It is answered, the same as it is written, "the
fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"; and this is "the kingdom
of heaven". And elsewhere they (t) ask, "what is the kingdom of heaven?"
To which is answered, "the Lord our God is one Lord". Yea, the Lord God
himself is so called (u), and sometimes the sanctuary; and sometimes
they intend by it the times of the Messiah, as the Baptist here does;
for so they paraphrase (w) those words,

"the time of the singing of birds, or of pruning, is come; the time for
Israel to be redeemed is come; the time for the uncircumcision to be cut
off is come; the time that the kingdom of the Cuthites (Samaritans or
Heathens) shall be consumed is come; and the time that "the kingdom of
heaven shall be revealed" is come, as it is written, "and the Lord shall
be king over all, the earth."''

Very pertinently does John make use of this argument to engage to
repentance; since there cannot be a greater motive to it, whether it
regard sorrow for sin, and confession of it, or a change of principles
and practice, than the grace of God through Christ, which is exhibited
in the Gospel dispensation: and very appropriately does he urge
repentance previous to the kingdom of heaven; because without that there
can be no true and cordial embracing or entering into the Gospel
dispensation, or kingdom of heaven; that is, no real and hearty
receiving the doctrines, and submitting to the ordinances of it. Nor
ought the Jews above all people to object to John's method of preaching;
since they make repentance absolutely necessary to the revelation of the
Messiah and his kingdom, and redemption by him; for they say (x) in so
many words, that

"if Israel do not repent, they will never be redeemed; but as soon as
they repent, they will be redeemed; yea, if they repent but one day,
immediately the son of David will come.''

[Matthew 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 3:3</span></span>

For this is he that was spoken of,.... These are not the words of the
Baptist himself, as in [Joh 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023.md) but
of the Evangelist, who cites and applies to John a passage in the
Prophet Isaiah, [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md) and that
very pertinently, since that "chapter" is a prophecy of the Messiah. The
consolations spoken of in [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md),
were to be in the days of the king Messiah, as a writer of note (y)
among the Jews observes. The Messiah is more expressly prophesied of in
[Isa 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009.md) as one that should appear to
the joy of his people, and "come with a strong hand", vigorously
prosecute his designs, faithfully perform his work, and then receive his
reward; he is spoken of under the "character" of a "shepherd", who would
tenderly discharge the several parts of his office as such, which
character is frequently given to the Messiah in the Old Testament: now
the person spoken of in [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md) was
to be his harbinger to go before him, proclaim and make ready for his
coming; and what is said of him agrees entirely with John the Baptist,
as the character given of him,

the voice of one crying, lowing like an ox; which expresses the
austerity of the man, the roughness of his voice, the severity of his
language; that he called aloud and spoke out, openly, publicly, and
freely; and that he delivered himself in preaching with a great deal of
zeal and fervency. The place where he preached was "in the wilderness",
that is, of Judea, where he is said before, in [Mat
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md) to come preaching. The doctrine he
preached was,

prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight, which is best
explained by what is said before, in [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md)

repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The Lord whom ye have
sought, the Messiah whom you have expected, is just coming, he will
quickly appear; prepare to meet him by repentance, and receive him by
faith, relinquish your former notions and principles, correct your
errors, and amend your lives, remove all out of the way which may be
offensive to him. The allusion is to a great personage being about to
make his public appearance or entrance; when a harbinger goes before
him, orders the way to be cleared, all impediments to be removed, and
everything got ready for the reception of him.

[Matthew 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 3:4</span></span>

The same John had his raiment,.... The Evangelist goes on to describe
this excellent person, the forerunner of our Lord, by his raiment;

the same John of whom Isaiah prophesied, and who came preaching the
doctrine in the place and manner before expressed,

had his raiment of camel's hair; not of camel's hair softened and
dressed, which the Talmudists (z) call "camel's wool"; of which wool of
camels and of hares, the Jews say (a) the coats were made, with which
God clothed Adam and Eve; and which being spun to a thread, and wove,
and made a garment of, they call (b) and we "camlet"; for this would
have been too fine and soft for John to wear, which is denied of him,
[Mat 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#008.md) but either of a camel's skin
with the hair on it, such was the "rough garment", or "garment of hair",
the prophets used to wear, [Zac 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004.md)
or of camels hair not softened but undressed; and so was very coarse and
rough, and which was suitable to the austerity of his life, and the
roughness of his ministry. And it is to be observed he appeared in the
same dress as Elijah or Elias did, [Kg2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008.md) in whose spirit and power he came,
and whose name he bore, [Luk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md).

And a leathern girdle about his loins; and such an one also Elijah was
girt with, [Kg2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008.md) and which added to
the roughness of his garment, though it shows he was prepared and in a
readiness to do the work he was sent about.

And his meat was locusts and wild honey; by the "locusts" some have
thought are meant a sort of fish called "crabs", which John found upon
the banks of Jordan, and lived upon; others, that a sort of wild fruit,
or the tops of trees and plants he found in the wilderness and fed on,
are designed; but the truth is, these were a sort of creatures "called
locusts", and which by the ceremonial law were lawful to be eaten, see
[Lev 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#022). The Misnic doctors (c.md)
describe such as are fit to be eaten after this manner;

"all that have four feet and four wings, and whose thighs and wings
cover the greatest part of their body, and whose name is "a locust."''

For it seems they must not only have these marks and signs, but must be
so called, or by a word in any other language which answers to it, as
the commentators (d) on this passage observe; and very frequently do
these writers speak (e) of locusts that are clean, and may be eaten.
Maimonides (f) reckons up "eight" sorts of them, which might be eaten
according to the law. Besides, these were eaten by people of other
nations, particularly the Ethiopians (g), Parthians (h), and Lybians
(i).

And wild honey: this was honey of bees, which were not kept at home, but
such as were in the woods and fields; of this sort was that which
Jonathan found, and eat of, [Sa1 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#025.md)
now the honey of bees might be eaten, according to the Jewish laws (k),
though bees themselves might not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 3:5</span></span>

Then went out to him Jerusalem,.... The uncommon appearance of this
person, the oddness of his dress, the austerity of his life, together
with the awfulness and importance of his doctrine, and the novelty of
the ordinance of baptism he administered, and the Jews having had no
prophet for some hundreds of years, and imagining he might be the
Messiah, quickly drew large numbers of people to him. Some copies read
"all Jerusalem": that is, the inhabitants of that city, a very large
number of them; and "all Judea", a great number of people from all parts
of that country. "All" is here put for "many". And

all the region round about Jordan; multitudes from thence, which seems
to be the same country with that which is called "beyond Jordan", [Mat
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#025.md) and is distinguished from Judea
as here. The Septuagint in [Ch2 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#017.md)
use the same phrase the Evangelist does here, and likewise in [Gen
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md).

[Matthew 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 3:6</span></span>

And were baptized of him,.... The place where they were baptized of him
was, "in Jordan"; some copies read, "in the river Jordan", as in [Mar
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005.md). As to the name of this river, and
the etymology of it, the Jews say (l) it was so called, "because it
descended" from Dan, i.e. Leshem Dan, or Pamias, which they say is a
cave at the head of it. It was in John's time and long after a
considerable river, a river to swim in; we (m) read that "Resh Lakish
was swimming in Jordan." And elsewhere (n), that one day "R. Jochanan
was swimming in Jordan." Also it was a river for boats and ships to pass
in, so that it was a navigable river; hence we read (o) of "the boat of
Jordan", and of ships in it, and of such and such things being forbidden
to be carried over Jordan in a ship (p); particularly,

"a man might not take the water of the sin offering, and the ashes of
the sin offering, and carry them over Jordan in a ship.''

Pliny (q), Pausanias (r), Solinus (s), and others, speak of it as a very
considerable and delightful river; see [Jos
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015.md). The Christians of Christ's time
are called by the Jews, in a way of contempt, apostates, that received
the doctrine of baptism, and were "dipped in Jordan" (t). The manner in
which they were baptized by him was by immersion or plunging them in the
water: this may be concluded from the signification of the word where
used, which in the primary sense of it signifies to dip or plunge; from
the place in which they were baptized, "the river Jordan"; and from
John's constant manner of baptizing elsewhere, who chose places for this
purpose, where and because there was there much water; see [Joh
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#028.md). The character of the persons
baptized by him is this, they were such as were

confessing their sins. They were called to repentance by John's
ministry, and had the grace of it bestowed upon them; being thoroughly
convinced of sin, and truly sorry for it, they were ready to acknowledge
and confess it to God and men; and such an abiding sense they had of it
upon their minds, that they continued doing it: they were not only
confessing their sins before baptism, which engaged John to administer
it to them; since we find afterwards he refused to admit others, because
of their want of repentance and fruits meet for it; but also whilst they
were going into the water, and when they came up out of it, so full were
they of a sense of sin, and so ready to own it. Even in baptism itself
there is a tacit confession and acknowledgment of sin, for it represents
the sufferings and death of Christ which were for sin, into which
persons are baptized, and profess to be dead to sin thereby; and also
the resurrection of Christ for justification from sin, which obliges the
baptized person to walk in newness of life, see [Rom
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003.md) besides, in this ordinance
believers are led to the blood of Christ, both for the cleansing and
remission of their sins, which suppose filth and guilt, [Act
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016.md) and [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md). Now this is the character given
of the very first persons that were baptized by John, and ought surely
to be attended to, by us; and as much care as possible should be taken,
that none but such as have a true sense of sin, and are brought to an
humble and hearty acknowledgment of it, be admitted to this ordinance.

[Matthew 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 3:7</span></span>

But when he saw many of the Pharisees,.... This being the first place in
which mention is made of the Pharisees and Sadducees, it may not be
amiss to give some account of them once for all, and to begin with the
Pharisees, and first with their name. Some derive this word from pharatz
to "divide", to "make a breach", from whence Phares had his name [Gen
38:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#029) so Jerom (u.md), who observes, that

"the Pharisees, who separated themselves from the people as righteous
persons, were called "divisi, the divided."''

And in (w) another place,

"because the Pharisees were "divided" from the Jews on account of some
superfluous observations, they also took their name from their
disagreement.''

Origen (x) seems to refer to this etymology of the word, when he says,

"the Pharisees, according to their name, were , certain divided and
seditious persons.''

And true it is, that this sect often meddled with the affairs of the
government, and were very ambitious of being concerned therein. Josephus
(y) observes of queen Alexandra, that she governed others, and the
Pharisees governed her; hence, though they were in great esteem with the
people, they were rather dreaded than loved by the government. Others
derive this name from "Pharas" to "expand", or "stretch out"; either
because they made broad their phylacteries, and enlarged the borders of
their garments; or because they exposed themselves to public notice, did
all they could to be seen of men, prayed in the corners of the streets,
had a trumpet blown before them when they gave alms, chose the uppermost
rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, greetings in the
markets, and to be called of men "Rabbi": all which to be sure are their
just characters. Others derive it from the same word, as signifying to
"explain" or "expound"; because it was one part of their work, and in
which they excelled, to expound the law; but this cannot be the reason
of their general name, because there were women Pharisees as well as
men, who cannot be thought to be employed in that work. The more
generally received opinion is, that this name is taken from the above
word, as signifying to "separate"; because they separated themselves
from the men and manners of the world, to the study of the law, and to a
greater degree of holiness, at least in pretence, than other persons.
They were strict observers of the traditions of the elders; are said, to
hold both fate and free will; they owned the resurrection of the dead,
and that there were angels and spirits, in which they differed from the
Sadducees. Or rather they have their name from which signifies "a
reward"; they being stiff defenders of the doctrine of rewards and
punishments in a future state, which the Sadducees denied. The Talmudic
writers (z) say, there were "seven" sorts of them, and if it would not
be too tedious to the reader, I would give the names of them; and the
rather, because some of them seem to tally with the complexion and
conduct of the Pharisees mentioned in the scriptures. There were then,

1\. the "Shechemite Pharisee", who does as Shechem did; is circumcised,
not on God's account, or for his glory, or because circumcision is a
command of his, but for his own profit and advantage, and that he may
get honour from men.

2\. "the dashing Pharisee"; who walks gently, the heel of one foot
touching the great toe of the other; and scarce lifts up his feet from
the earth, so that he dashes them against the stones, and would be
thought hereby to be in deep meditation.

3\. the "Pharisee letting blood"; who makes as if he shut his eyes, that
he may not look upon women, and so runs and dashes his head against the
wall, till the blood gushes out, as though a vein was opened.

4\. the "depressed Pharisee"; who went double, or bowed down, or as
others render the phrase, "the mortar Pharisee"; either because he wore
a garment like a mortar, with the mouth turned downwards; or a hat
resembling such a vessel; so that he could not look upward, nor on
either side, only downward, or right forward.

5\. the Pharisee, that said, what is my duty and I will do it? the gloss
upon it is, teach me what is my duty, and I will do it: Lo! this is his
excellency, if he is not expert in the prohibitions and niceties of the
commands, and comes to learn; or thus, what is more to be done and I
have not done it? so that he shows himself, or would appear as if he had
performed all.

6\. "the Pharisee of fear"; who does what he does from fear of
punishment.

7\. "the Pharisee of love"; who does what he does from love; which the
gloss explains thus: for the love of the reward of the commandment, and
not for the love of the commandment of his Creator; though they say of
all these there is none to be beloved, but the Pharisee of love.

When this sect first began, and who was the first author of it, is not
easy to say; it is certain there were great numbers of them in the times
of John the Baptist, and of Christ, and for some time after. The Jews
say (a), that when the temple was destroyed the second time, the
Pharisees increased in Israel.

Next let us consider the Sadducees, who they were, and from whence they
sprung. These have their name not from "Saddik righteous" (b), or "Sedek
righteousness", being self justitiaries; for though they were, yet this
would not have distinguished them from the Pharisees, who were likewise
such; but from Sadok or Saduk, a disciple of Antigonus, a man of Socho
(c). The occasion of this new sect was this; Antigonus, among the
instructions he gave to his scholars, had this saying;

"be not as servants who serve their master for the sake of reward; but
be ye as servants that serve their master not for the sake of reward,
and let the fear of God be upon you.''

Which, when Sadok and a fellow scholar, whose name was Baithos, or
Baithus, heard, not rightly understanding him, concluded that there was
no future state of rewards and punishments; which notion they broached
and had their followers, who from the one were called Sadducees, and
sometimes from the other Baithuseans: these men held the Scriptures
only, rejecting the traditions of the elders; they denied fate, and
ascribed all to free will; they affirmed that there is no resurrection
of the dead; that the soul dies with the body; that there is no future
state after this life, and that there are neither angels nor spirits.
Now when "John saw" or observed "many" of both these sects "come to his
baptism"; not merely to see it administered, led thither by the novelty
of the thing; but to submit to it, to which they might be induced by
that very great character of a very holy good man, which John had got
among the people; and they were desirous of being thought so too, and
therefore desired to be baptized by him; but he knowing the men and
their manners,

said unto them; addressed them in a very severe style, quite contrary to
their expectation, and the opinion the people had of them,

O generation of vipers! It seems their parents before them were vipers,
and they their offspring were like them, in hypocrisy and malice. The
viper appears very beautiful outwardly, but is full of poison; it looks
harmless and innocent, as if it neither could nor would do any hurt, its
teeth being hid, but is a most deadly and hurtful creature: so these
men, though they made specious pretences to religion and holiness, yet
were full of the deadly poison of hypocrisy, malice, and error. A very
disagreeable salutation this must be to men, who were desirous of being
reckoned very religious, and who boasted of, and trusted in, their being
the seed of Abraham; when they were the children of the devil, the seed
of the old serpent, and the offspring of the worst of men, and in whom
was verified the proverb, like father like son. John proceeds and asks,
saying, "who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" who has
suggested this to you? from whom have ye received this hint? who has
pointed out the way to you to escape divine vengeance, or the ruin which
will quickly come upon you? for by

wrath to come is not meant hell fire, everlasting destruction, from
which baptism could not save them; but temporal calamity and
destruction, the wrath which in a little time came upon that nation to
the uttermost, for rejecting the Messiah, and the Gospel dispensation;
from which they might have been saved, had they given credit to Jesus as
the Messiah, though only with a bare assent; and had they entered into
the kingdom of heaven, or Messiah, the Gospel dispensation, by receiving
its doctrines, and submitting to its ordinances, though only externally.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 3:8</span></span>

Bring forth therefore fruits,.... That is, if you are truly penitent, if
you have a proper sense of sin, and true repentance for it, do such
works as are suitable to it, and will show the genuineness of it; for

fruits meet for repentance are the same as "works meet for repentance",
[Act 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#020.md) and as a tree is known by
its fruit, so repentance is known by good works; these are the fruits
and effects of repentance, and which are proofs with men of the
sincerity of it. Those which follow upon evangelical repentance are such
as are mentioned in [Co2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md). Now let
it be observed, that John insisted upon repentance, and a good
conversation, attesting the truth of it as necessary prerequisites to
the ordinance of baptism; and so Peter first urged repentance; and then
proposed baptism, [Act 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md) from
whence one should think it may be rationally and strongly concluded,
that none but truly repenting sinners, and such who have given proofs
that they are so, are to be admitted to this ordinance.

[Matthew 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 3:9</span></span>

And think not to say within yourselves,.... John knew the sentiments of
their minds, and the prevailing opinion they had given into, against
which he cautions them; as, that because they were Abraham's seed, they
were in a state of salvation, in the favour of God, and had a right to
all privileges and ordinances: this they trusted in, and boasted of, and
would often think of it within themselves, pleasing themselves with the
thoughts of it, and speak of it to others;

we have Abraham for our father. The Baptist was aware how ready they
would be to object this to him; and therefore prevents their plea from
hence in favour of their admission to baptism, by assuring them, that
this would have no weight with him, nor give them any right to the
ordinance he administered: hence it appears that it is not a person's
being born of believing parents that can entitle him to water baptism;
or be a reason why it ought to be administered to him: if nothing more
than this can be said in his favour, it is a plain case from hence, he
ought to be debarred from it. The reason John gives why such a plea as
this would be insufficient is,

for I say unto you; I assure you of it; you may depend on it as a
certain truth,

that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. To
"raise up children" is an Hebrew way of speaking, and the same with or
to "raise up seed", or a "name" to another, [Gen
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#008.md) and signifies to beget children
for another, who are to be called by his name. Some by "the stones"
understand the Gentiles, comparable to stones, both for the hardness of
their hearts, and their idolatry in worshipping stocks and stones; of
and among whom God was able to raise, and has raised up, a spiritual
seed to Abraham; who are of the same faith with him, who walk in his
steps, and whose father he is: but then it must be supposed, according
to this sense, that there were some Gentiles present, since John calls
them "these" stones, pointing to some persons or things, that were
before him; wherefore I rather think that this phrase is to be taken
literally, and that John pointed to some certain stones that were near
him, within sight, and which lay upon the banks of Jordan, where he was
baptizing; for what is it that the omnipotent God cannot do? He could as
easily of stones make men, as make Adam out of the dust of the earth,
and then make these men, in a spiritual sense, children of Abraham; that
is, believers in Christ, and partakers of his "grace; for if ye be
Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
promise", [Gal 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029.md). So that God stood
in no need of these persons, nor had they any reason to boast of their
natural descent from Abraham; since this in spiritual matters, and in
things relating to the Gospel dispensation, would stand them in no
stead, or be of any advantage to them.

[Matthew 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 3:10</span></span>

And now also the axe is laid,.... These words may be rendered, "for now
also", and contain in them a reason why they might expect future wrath;
why they should bring forth good fruit; and why they should not trust to
nor plead their descent from Abraham, because "the axe is now laid": by
which is meant, not the Gospel which now began to be preached by John;
though this was like an axe laid to the root of, and which cut down,
their pride and vanity, their self-confidence and glorying in their
righteousness, holiness, carnal wisdom, and fleshly privileges: but
rather; the axe of God's judgment and vengeance is here designed, which,
because of the certainty and near approach of it, is said to be "now
laid"; and that not to some of the branches only, to lop them off, to
take away from the Jews some particular privileges, but "to the root" of
all their privileges, civil and ecclesiastical; even the covenant which
God had made with that people as a nation, who was now about to write
"Lo Ammi" upon them; so that henceforward they would have nothing to
expect from their being the seed of Abraham, Israelites, or circumcised
persons. The time was just at hand, when the Lord would take his "staff
Beauty and cut it asunder, that he might break the covenant he had made
with all the people", [Zac 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#010.md) in a
short time their civil polity and church state would be both at an end.
The Romans, who were already among them and over them, would very
quickly come upon them, and cut them off root and branch; and utterly
destroy their temple, city, and nation: and this ruin and destruction
was levelled not at a single tree, a single person, or family only, as
Jesse's, or any others, but at the root

of the trees: of all the trees of the whole body of the people; for the
covenant which was made with them all being broke, and which was their
hedge and fence, they were all exposed to the wild boar of the forest.

Therefore every tree, every individual person, though one of Abraham's
children, and made never such a fair show in the

flesh, which bringeth not forth good fruit; does not perform good works
from a right principle, to a right end, such as are meet for repentance;
particularly, does not believe in the Messiah now ready to be revealed,
which is the main and principal work; and does not continue so doing,
and thus believing,

is hewn down and cast into the fire. Temporal ruin and destruction shall
come upon him; he shall not escape divine vengeance here, and shall be
cast into everlasting burnings hereafter; which is quite contrary to a
notion of theirs, that "by the merits of Abraham", the Israelites shall
be delivered from the fire of hell (d).

[Matthew 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 3:11</span></span>

I indeed baptize you with water,.... These words, at first view, look as
if they were a continuation of John's discourse with the Pharisees and
Sadducees, and as though he had baptized them; whereas by comparing them
with what the other Evangelists relate, see [Mar
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005.md) they are spoken to the people,
who, confessing their sins, had been baptized by him; to whom he gives
an account of the ordinance of water baptism, of which he was the
administrator, in what manner, and on what account he performed it:

I indeed baptize you; or, as Mark says, "I have baptized you"; I have
authority from God so to do; my commission reaches thus far, and no
farther; I can administer, and have administered the outward ordinance
to you; but the inward grace and increase of it, together with the
ordinary and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, I cannot confer. I can,
and do baptize, upon a profession of repentance, and I can threaten
impenitent sinners with divine vengeance; but I cannot bestow the grace
of repentance on any, nor punish for impenitence, either here or
hereafter; these things are out of my power, and belong to another
person hereafter named: all that I do, and pretend to do, is to baptize

with water, or rather in water, as should be rendered. Our version seems
to be calculated in favour of pouring, or sprinkling water upon, or
application of it to the person baptized, in opposition to immersion in
it; whereas the "preposition" is not instrumental, but local, and
denotes the place, the river Jordan, and the element of water there, in
which John was baptizing: and this he did

unto repentance, or "at", or upon "repentance": for so may be rendered,
as it is in [Mat 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041.md) for the meaning
is not that John baptized them, in order to bring them to repentance;
since he required repentance and fruits meet for it, previous to
baptism; but that he had baptized them upon the foot of their
repentance; and so the learned Grotius observes, that the phrase may be
very aptly explained thus: "I baptize you upon the \`profession' of
repentance which ye make." John gives a hint of the person whose
forerunner he was, and of his superior excellency to him: he indeed
first speaks of him as one behind him, not in nature or dignity, but in
order of time as man;

but he that comes after me. John was born before Jesus, and began his
ministry before he did; he was his harbinger; Jesus was now coming after
him to Jordan from Galilee, to be baptized by him, and then enter on his
public ministry: but though he came after him in this sense, he was not
beneath, but above him in character; which he freely declares, saying,

is mightier than I; not only as he is the mighty God, and so infinitely
mightier than he; but in his office and ministry, which was exercised
with greater power and authority, and attended with mighty works and
miracles, and was followed with the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit.
Not to mention the mighty work of redemption performed by him; the
resurrection of his own body from the dead; and his exaltation in human
nature, above all power, might, and dominion. The Baptist was so
sensible of the inequality between them, and of his unworthiness to be
mentioned with him, that he seems at a loss almost to express his
distance from him; and therefore signifies it by his being unfit to
perform one of the most servile offices to him,

whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; or as the other Evangelists relate
it, "whose shoelatchet I am not worthy to unloose"; which amounts to the
same sense, since shoes are unloosed in order to be taken from, or
carried before, or after a person; which to do was the work of servants
among the Jews. In the Talmud (e) it is asked,

"What is the manner of possessing of servants? or what is their service?
He buckles his (master's) shoes; he "unlooses his shoes", and "carries
them before him to the bath."''

Or, as is elsewhere (f) said,

"he unlooses his shoes, or carries after him his vessels (whatever he
wants) to the bath; he unclothes him, he washes him, he anoints him, he
rubs him, he clothes him, he buckles his shoes, and lifts him up.''

This was such a servile work, that it was thought too mean for a scholar
or a disciple to do; for it is (g) said,

"all services which a servant does for his master, a disciple does for
his master, , "except unloosing his shoes".''

The gloss on it says, "he that sees it, will say, he is a "Canaanitish
servant":''

for only a Canaanitish, not an Hebrew servant (h), might be employed in,
or obliged to such work; for it was reckoned not only, mean and servile,
but even base and reproachful. It is one of their (i) canons;

"if thy brother is become poor, and is sold unto thee, thou shalt not
make him do the work of a servant; that is, , any reproachful work; such
as to buckle his shoes, or unloose them, or carry his instruments (or
necessaries) after him to the bath.''

Now John thought himself unworthy; it was too great an honour for him to
do that for Christ, which was thought too mean for a disciple to do for
a wise man, and too scandalous for an Hebrew servant to do for his
master, to whom he was sold; which shows the great humility of John, and
the high opinion he had of Christ. It has been controverted whether
Christ wore shoes or not; Jerom affirmed that he did not: but it seems
from hence that he did; nor were the Jews used to walk barefoot, but on
certain occasions. The Baptist points at the peculiar work of this great
person, in which he greatly exceeds anything done by him;

he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire; referring,
either to the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, to be bestowed on the
disciples on the day of Pentecost, of which the cloven tongues, like as
of fire, which appeared unto them, and sat upon them, were the symbols;
which was an instance of the great power and grace of Christ, and of his
exaltation at the Father's right hand. Or rather, this phrase is
expressive of the awful judgments which should be inflicted by him on
the Jewish nation; when he by his Spirit should "reprove" them for the
sin of rejecting him; and when he should appear as a "refiner's fire",
and as "fuller's soap"; when "the day of the Lord" should "burn as an
oven"; when he should "purge the blood of Jerusalem", his own blood, and
the blood of the Apostles and Prophets shed in it, "from the midst
thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning"; the
same with "the Holy Ghost and fire" here, or the fire of the Holy Ghost,
or the holy Spirit of fire; and is the same with "the wrath to come",
and with what is threatened in the context: the unfruitful trees shall
be cut down, and cast into the fire", and the "chaff" shall be burnt
with unquenchable fire". And as this sense best agrees with the context,
it may the rather be thought to be genuine; since John is speaking not
to the disciples of Christ, who were not yet called, and who only on the
day of Pentecost were baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire, in the
other sense of this phrase; but to the people of the Jews, some of whom
had been baptized by him; and others were asking him questions, others
gazing upon him, and wondering what manner of person he was; and
multitudes of them continued obdurate and impenitent under his ministry,
whom he threatens severely in the context. Add to all this, that the
phrase of dipping or baptizing in fire seems to be used in this sense by
the Jewish writers. In the Talmud (k) one puts the question, In what
does he (God,) dip? You will say in water, as it is written, "who hath
measured the waters in the hollow of his hand?" Another replies, , "he
dips in fire"; as it is written, "for behold the Lord will come with
fire". What is the meaning of , "baptism in fire?" He answers, according
to the mind of Rabbah, the root of "dipping in the fire", is what is
written; "all that abideth not the fire, ye shall make go" through the
water. Dipping in the fire of the law, is a phrase used by the Jews (l).
The phrases of "dipping, and washing in fire", are also used by Greek
(m) authors.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 3:12</span></span>

Whose fan is in his hand,.... The Jews had their hand fans, and which
were like a man's hand; their names were ; which, as Maimonides says
(n), were three sorts of instruments used in the floor, in form of a
man's hand; with which they cleansed the wheat and barley from the
straw; and their names differ according to their form: some have many
teeth, and with them they cleanse the wheat at the end of the work; and
there are others that have few teeth, no more than three, and with these
they purge the wheat at first, from the thick straw. By the "fan", here
is meant, either the Gospel which Christ was just ready to publish; by
which he would effectually call his chosen people among the Jews, and so
distinguish and separate them from others, as well as purify and cleanse
them, or rather the awful judgment of God, which Christ was ready to
execute, and in a short time would execute on the unbelieving and
impenitent Jews: hence it is said to be "in his hand"; being put there
by his Father, who "hath committed all judgment to the Son". That this
is the meaning of the "Baptist", seems evident, since "fanning" is
always, when figuratively taken, used for judgments, [Isa
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#016.md). By "his floor", is meant the
land of Israel, where he was born, brought up, and lived; of which the
Lord says, "O my threshing, and the corn of my floor!" [Isa
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md). This, he says, "he will
thoroughly purge" of all his refuse and chaff, that is, by fanning: so
fanning and cleansing, or purging, are joined together, [Jer
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md) so is used for purging by
fanning, in the Misnic writings (o). By "his wheat", are meant his elect
among the Jews, the chosen of God and precious; so called because of
their excellency, purity, usefulness, solidity, and constancy: these he
"will gather into his garner"; meaning either some place of protection,
where he would direct his people to for safety from that wrath, ruin,
and destruction; which should fall upon the Jewish nation; or else the
kingdom of heaven, into which he would bring them, by taking them out of
the world from the evil to come. By "the chaff", are meant wicked and
ungodly persons, such as are destitute of the grace of God, whether
professors, or profane; being empty, barren, and unfruitful; and so good
for nothing but the fire, which therefore "he will burn with
unquenchable fire", of divine wrath and vengeance: an allusion to a
custom among the Jews, who, when they purified the increase of their
unclean fields, gathered it together in an "area" or floor, in the midst
of them, and then sifted it with sieves; one sort with two sieves,
another with three, that they might thoroughly purge it, and burnt the
chaff and stalks (p); see [Isa 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md).

Then cometh Jesus,.... That is, when John had been some time preaching
the doctrine of repentance, and administering the ordinance of baptism;
for which, time must be allowed, since he went into all the country
about Jordan, and preached unto them, and baptized such large numbers:
very probably it might be six months from his first entrance on his
ministry; since there was this difference in their age, and so might be
in their baptism and preaching. Now when John had given notice of the
Messiah's coming, and so had prepared his way; had declared the
excellency of his person, the nature of his work, and office, and had
raised in the people an expectation of him,

then cometh Jesus from Galilee; from Nazareth of Galilee, [Mar
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#009.md) where he had lived for many years,
as the Jews (q) themselves own; in great obscurity, in all obedience to
God, in subjection to his parents, exercising a conscience void of
offence towards God and man, and employing his time in devotion and
business: from hence he came to Jordan to John, who was baptizing there;
which shows the great humility of Christ, who comes to John, and does
not send for him, though John was his servant, and he was his Lord and
Master; and also his cheerful and voluntary subjection to the ordinance
of baptism, since of himself, of his own accord, he took this long and
fatiguing journey; for Nazareth, according to David de Pomis (r), was
three days journey from Jerusalem, though somewhat nearer Jordan; the
end and design of his coming was

to be baptized of him. It may reasonably be inquired what should be
Christ's view in desiring to be baptized; it could not be to take away
original or actual sin, since he had neither; nor has baptism any such
efficacy to do this, in those who have either or both: but, it was to
show his approbation of John's baptism, and to bear a testimony of it,
that it was from heaven; and also that he himself might receive a
testimony both from heaven, and from John, that he was the Son of God
and true Messiah, before he entered upon his public ministry, into which
he was in some measure initiated and installed hereby; and moreover, to
set an example to his followers, and thereby engage their attention and
subjection to this ordinance; and, in a word, as he himself says, to
fulfil all righteousness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 3:14</span></span>

But John forbad him, saying,.... It appears from hence, that John knew
Christ before he baptized him, and before he saw the Spirit descending
and abiding on him, [Joh 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033.md)
wherefore that was not a signal, whereby he should first know him but
whereby his knowledge of him should be confirmed; which knowledge of him
he had, not through his kindred to him, or by any conversation he had
with him before, but by immediate, divine revelation: upon which account
he "forbad him"; refused to administer the ordinance to him; earnestly
entreated that he would not insist upon it; desired to be excused being
concerned herein: and this he did, partly lest the people should think
Christ was not so great a person as he had represented him to be; yea,
that he was one of the penitent sinners John had admitted to his
baptism; and chiefly because of the majesty and dignity of Christ's
person, who he knew stood in no need of such an outward ordinance; and
because of his own unworthiness to administer it to him, as is evident
from what follows,

I have need to be baptized of thee; not with water baptism, which Christ
never administered, but with the baptism of the Spirit, which was his
peculiar office. Hence we learn, that though John was so holy a man, was
filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb, had such large
measures of grace, and lived such an exemplary life and conversation;
yet was far from thinking, that he was perfect and righteous in himself,
but stood in need of Christ, and of more grace from him. He seems
surprised that Christ should come to him, and make such a motion to him;
when it was his duty and privilege to come to him daily for fresh
supplies of grace, and always to trust in him for life and salvation;

and comest thou to me? who am of the earth, earthly, when thou art the
Lord from heaven; "to me", a poor sinful creature, when thou art the
Holy One of God; "to me", who am thy servant, when thou art Lord of all;
"to me", who always stand in need of thy grace, when thou art God all
sufficient.

And Jesus answering, said unto him,.... This is an Hebrew way of
speaking, often used in the Old Testament, and answers to see [Job
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001.md). He replied to John, who had made
use of very forbidding words, after this manner,

suffer it to be so now; let me have my request; do not go on to object,
but comply with my desire; let it be done now, immediately, directly, at
this present time; do not put me off with any excuse; it is a proper
season for it, even "now", since the time is not yet come that I am to
baptize with the Holy Ghost; and besides, thus it becometh us to fulfil
all righteousness. It became John to administer the ordinance of baptism
to Christ, as he was his forerunner, and the only administrator of it,
and that he might fulfil the ministry which he had received; and as it
became Christ to fulfil all righteousness, moral and ceremonial, and
baptism being a part of his Father's will, which he came to do, it
became him to fulfil this also. And since it became Christ, it cannot be
unbecoming us to submit to this ordinance; and since he looked upon it
as a part of righteousness to be fulfilled by him, it ought to be
attended to by all those who would be accounted followers of him. Christ
having strongly urged the conveniency and equity of the administration
of baptism to him, which showed his eager desire after it, and the
lowliness of his mind; and John being convinced, and overcome by the
force of his reasoning, agrees to his baptism;

then he suffered him, i.e. to be baptized in water by him, as he had
requested, and accordingly did administer it to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 3:16</span></span>

And Jesus, when he was baptized,.... Christ, when he was baptized by
John in the river Jordan, the place where he was baptizing,

went up straightway out of the water. One would be at a loss at first
sight for a reason why the Evangelist should relate this circumstance;
for after the ordinance was administered, why should he stay in the
water? what should he do there? Everyone would naturally and reasonably
conclude, without the mention of such a circumstance, that as soon as
his baptism was over, he would immediately come up out of the water.
However, we learn this from it, that since it is said, that he came up
out of the water, he must first have gone down into it; must have been
in it, and was baptized in it; a circumstance strongly in favour of
baptism by immersion: for that Christ should go down into the river,
more or less deep, to the ankles, or up to the knees, in order that John
should sprinkle water on his face, or pour it on his head, as is
ridiculously represented in the prints, can hardly obtain any credit
with persons of thought and sense. But the chief view of the Evangelist
in relating this circumstance, is with respect to what follows; and to
show, that as soon as Christ was baptized, and before he had well got
out of the water,

lo the heavens were opened: and some indeed read the word "straightway",
in connection with this phrase, and not with the words "went up": but
there is no need of supposing such a trajection, for the whole may be
rendered thus;

and Jesus, when he was baptized, was scarcely come up out of the water,
but lo, immediately, directly, as soon as he was out, or rather before,

the heavens were opened to him; the airy heaven was materially and
really opened, parted, rent, or cloven asunder, as in [Mar
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010.md) which made way for the visible
descent of the Holy Ghost in a bodily shape. A difficulty arises here,
whether the words, "to him", are to be referred to Christ, or to John;
no doubt but the opening of the heavens was seen by them both: but to me
it seems that John is particularly designed, since this vision was upon
his account, and for his sake, and to him the following words belong;
"and he", that is,

John, saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon
him: for this is what was promised to John, as a sign, which should
confirm his faith in Jesus, as the true Messiah, and which he himself
says he saw, and upon which he based the record and testimony he bore to
Christ, as the Son of God; see [Joh
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032.md) not but that the descent of the
Holy Ghost in this manner might be seen by Christ, as well as John,
according to [Mar 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010.md). The Spirit of
God, here said to descend and light on Christ, is the same, which in the
first creation moved upon the face of the waters; and now comes down on
Christ, just as he was coming up out of the waters of Jordan, where he
had been baptized; and which the Jews (r) so often call , "the Spirit of
the king Messiah, and the spirit of the Messiah". The descent of him was
in a "bodily shape", as Luke says in [Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022.md) either in the shape of a dove,
which is a very fit emblem of the Spirit of God who descended, and the
fruits thereof, such as simplicity, meekness, love, &c. and also of the
dove-like innocence, humility, and affection of Christ, on whom he
lighted; or it was in some other visible form, not expressed, which
pretty much resembled the hovering and lighting of a dove upon anything:
for it does not necessarily follow from any of the accounts the
Evangelists give of this matter, that the holy Spirit assumed, or
appeared in, the form of a dove; only that his visible descent and
lighting on Christ was , as a dove descends, hovers and lights; which
does not necessarily design the form of the creature, but the manner of
its motion. However, who can read this account without thinking of
Noah's dove, which brought in its mouth the olive leaf, a token of peace
and reconciliation, when the waters were abated from off the earth? Give
me leave to transcribe a passage I have met with in the book of Zohar
(s);

"a door shall be opened, and out of it shall come forth the dove which
Noah sent out in the days of the flood, as it is written, "and he sent
forth the dove", that famous dove; but the ancients speak not of it, for
they knew not what it was, only from whence it came, and did its
message; as it is written, "it returned not again unto him any more": no
man knows whither it went, but it returned to its place, and was hid
within this door; and it shall take a crown in its mouth, and put it
upon the head of the king Messiah.''

And a little after, the dove is said to abide upon his head, and he to
receive glory from it. Whether this is the remains of some ancient
tradition, these men studiously conceal, concerning the opening of the
heavens, and the descent of the Spirit of God, as a dove, upon the
Messiah; or whether it is hammered out of the evangelic history, let the
reader judge.

[Matthew 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 3:17</span></span>

And lo, a voice from heaven, saying,.... At the same time the heavens
were opened, and the Spirit of God descended as a dove, and lighted on
Christ, and whilst it abode upon him, an extraordinary voice was heard;
hence the note of attention and admiration, "lo", is prefixed unto it,
as before, to the opening of the heavens; being what was unusual and
surprising; and as denoting something to be expressed of great moment
and importance. The Jews, in order to render this circumstance less
considerable, and to have it believed, that these voices from heaven
heard in the time of Jesus, and in relation to him were common things,
have invented a great many stories concerning , "the voice", or "the
daughter of the voice from heaven"; which they pretend came in the room
of prophecy: their (t) words are,

"after the death of the latter prophets, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi,
the holy Spirit departed from Israel, and thenceforwards they used "Bath
Kol", the "voice". One time they were sitting in the chamber of the
house of Guria in Jericho, and there came to them , "the voice from
heaven", (saying;) there is one here, who is fit to have the Shekinah
(or divine majesty) abide on him, as Moses our master; but because his
generation was not worthy, therefore the wise men set their eyes on
Hillell, the elder; and when he died, they said concerning him, this was
a holy man, a meek man, a disciple of Ezra. Again, another time they
were sitting in a chamber in Jabneh, and there came to them "the voice
from heaven", (saying;) there is one here, who is fit to have the
Shekinah dwell on him; but because his generation was not worthy,
therefore the wise men set their eyes on Samuel the little.''

I have cited this passage at large, partly because, according to them,
it fixes the date and use of "the voice"; and partly, because it affords
instances of it, wherefore more need not be mentioned; for, it would be
endless to repeat the several things spoken by it; such as encouraging
Herod to rebel, and seize his master's kingdom (u); forbidding Ben
Uzziel to go on with his paraphrase on the Hagiographa, or holy books,
when he had finished his Targum on the prophets (w); declaring the words
of Hillell and Shammai to be the words of the living God (x); signifying
the conception, birth, and death of (y) persons, and the like; all which
seem to be mere fiction and imagination, diabolical delusions, or
satanical imitations of this voice, that was now heard, in order to
lessen the credit of it. But, to proceed; this extraordinary voice from
heaven, which was formed in articulate sounds for the sake of John; and,
according to the other Evangelists, was directed to Christ, [Mar
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#011.md) expressed the following words,
"this is my beloved Son". "This" person, who had been baptized in water,
on whom the holy Spirit now rested, is no other than the Son of God in
human nature; which he assumed, in order to be obedient to this, and the
whole of his Father's will: he is his own proper "son", not by creation,
as angels, and men; nor by adoption, as saints; nor by office, as
magistrates; but in such a way of filiation as no other is: he is the
natural, essential, and only begotten Son of God; his beloved Son, whom
the Father loved from everlasting, as his own Son; the image of himself,
of the same nature with him, and possessed of the same perfections; whom
he loved, and continued to love in time, though clothed with human
nature, and the infirmities of it; appearing in the likeness of sinful
flesh; being in his state of humiliation, he loved him through it, and
all sorrows and sufferings that attended it. Christ always was, and ever
will be considered, both in his person as the Son of God, and in his
office as mediator, the object of his love and delight; wherefore he
adds,

in whom I am well pleased. Jehovah the Father took infinite delight and
pleasure in him as his own Son, who lay in his bosom before all worlds;
and was well pleased with him in his office relation, and capacity: he
was both well pleased in him as his Son, and delighted in him as his
servant, [Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md) he was pleased with
his assumption of human nature; with his whole obedience to the law; and
with his bearing the penalty and curse of it, in the room and stead of
his people: he was well pleased with and for his righteousness,
sacrifice and atonement; whereby his law was fulfilled, and his justice
satisfied. God is not only well pleased in, and with his Son, but with
all his people, as considered in him; in him he loves them, takes
delight in them, is pacified towards them, and graciously accepts of
them. It would be almost unpardonable, not to take notice of the
testimony here given to the doctrine of the Trinity; since a voice was
heard from the "father" in heaven, bearing witness to "the Son" in human
nature on earth, on whom "the Spirit" had descended and now abode. The
ancients looked upon this as so clear and full a proof of this truth,
that they were wont to say; Go to Jordan, and there learn the doctrine
of the Trinity. Add to all this, that since this declaration was
immediately upon the baptism of Christ, it shows that his Father highly
approved of, and was well pleased with his submission to that ordinance;
and which should be an encouraging motive to all believers to follow him
in it.
