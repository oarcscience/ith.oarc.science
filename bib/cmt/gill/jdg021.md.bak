INTRODUCTION TO JUDGES 21

This chapter relates how that when the Israelites calmed down, and
seriously to reflect on what had passed, they were sore grieved, and
much lamented the case of Benjamin, and were particularly concerned what
they should do for wives for those few men that remained, that the tribe
might be built up again, [Jdg 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md) and
for these they provided wives, partly out of Jabeshgilead, the
inhabitants of which came not up to the convention at Mizpeh, and
therefore they smote them, men, women, and children, only reserved four
hundred virgins, whom they gave to the men of Benjamin, [Jdg
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#008.md), and partly from among the
daughters of Shiloh, taken at a yearly feast there, the taking of whom
was connived at, the other number not being sufficient, [Jdg
21:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#016.md).

[Judges 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 21:1</span></span>

Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh,.... Where they were there
convened, before the war began; after they had heard the account the
Levite gave of the affair, which brought them thither; and after they
had sent messengers to Benjamin to deliver up the men of Gibeah, that
had committed the wickedness; and after they perceived that Benjamin did
not hearken to their demand, but prepared to make war with them; then,
as they resolved on the destruction of Gibeah, and of all the cities
that sent out men against them, even all the inhabitants of them, men,
women, and children, entered into an oath, that they would use those men
that remained as Heathens, and not intermarry with them, as follows:

saying, there shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to
wife; seeing those that used the wife of the Levite in such a base
manner, and those that protected and defended them, deserved to have no
wives.

[Judges 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 21:2</span></span>

And the people came to the house of God,.... Not to the city Bethel, as
the Targum, Septuagint, and other versions, but to Shiloh, where were
the tabernacle and ark; and this is to be understood of the army after
they had utterly destroyed the Benjaminites: hence we read of the camp
in Shiloh, [Jdg 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#012.md), here they came
not so much to rejoice, and be glad, and to return thanks for the
victory they had at last obtained, as to lament the unhappy case of the
tribe of Benjamin, and to have counsel and advice, and consider of ways
and means to repair their loss:

and abode there till even before God; fasting and praying, instead of
feasting and rejoicing:

and lifted up their voices, and wept sore; not so much, or at least not
only for the 40,000 Israelites that were slain, but for the tribe of
Benjamin, in danger of being lost, as follows.

[Judges 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 21:3</span></span>

And said, O Lord God of Israel,.... Jehovah, the only living and true
God, the Being of beings, eternal, immutable, omnipotent and
omnipresent, the God of all Israel, of the twelve tribes of Israel,
their covenant God and Father; who had shown favour to them in such a
peculiar and gracious manner, as he had not to other nations, and
therefore hoped he would still have a kind regard unto them, and suffer
them to expostulate with him in the following manner:

why is this come to pass in Israel; expressing, as Abarbinel thinks, a
concern for the 40,000 men of Israel which fell in the two first
battles; but it manifestly refers to the case in the next words:

that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel; meaning the
tribe of Benjamin, which was all destroyed, excepting six hundred men,
and these had no wives to propagate the tribe; and therefore, unless
some provision could be made for that, it must in a short time be
totally extinct; for which they express great concern, it not being
their intention when they made the above oath to extirpate them; but
such were now the circumstances of things in Providence, that it must
perish unless some way could be found to relieve it, and which their
oath seemed to preclude; and this threw them into great perplexity.

[Judges 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 21:4</span></span>

And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early,.... The
day after their fasting and prayer, and a sense of their present case
and circumstances being deeply impressed upon their minds, they rose
early in the morning to acts of devotion, and exercises of religion,
hoping that being in the way of their duty, the difficulties with which
they were perplexed would be removed:

and built there an altar; if this place was Bethel, as Kimchi reasons,
there Jacob had built an altar; but that in such a course of years might
have been demolished: and if it was Shiloh, there was the tabernacle,
and so the altar of the Lord there; wherefore this either signifies the
repairing of that, being in ruins, which is not likely, since it was but
lately used, [Jdg 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md) or the
building of a new one, which to do in the tabernacle was not unlawful,
especially when the number of sacrifices required it, which it is highly
probable was the case now, as it was at the dedication of the temple,
[Kg1 8:64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#064.md) though the above mentioned
writer thinks, that building an altar signifies, as in many places, only
seeking the Lord; but the use for which it was built is expressed:

and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings; both to atone for the
sins they had been guilty of in the prosecution of the war, and to
return thanks for victory given, and to implore fresh favours to be
bestowed upon them.

[Judges 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 21:5</span></span>

And the children of Israel said,.... One to another, after they had
offered their sacrifices, and while they were together in Shiloh:

who is there among all the tribes of Israel, that came not up with the
congregation unto the Lord? when they were summoned to come to Mizpeh,
to consult together about the affair of the Levite's concubine, as
appears by what follows:

for they had made a great oath; in a very awful and solemn manner, with
a curse annexed to it, as that about not giving a wife to Benjamin, [Jdg
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#018.md).

concerning him that came not up to the Lord to Mizpeh: not about him who
did not go out to battle against Benjamin, nor about every individual
that did not come to consult about it; but every city that did not send
their proper representatives or quota to assist in that affair:

he shall surely be put to death; this was sent along with the summons,
in order to quicken their attention to them.

[Judges 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 21:6</span></span>

And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother,....
Not that they went to war with them, as if their cause was not good; but
for the severity they had exercised towards them, especially in
destroying their women and children, and for the fatal consequences like
to follow here after, particularly the dissolution of the whole tribe:

and said, there is one tribe cut off from Israel this day; that is,
there is a likelihood or great danger of it.

[Judges 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 21:7</span></span>

How shall we do for wives for them that remain,.... By which it seems,
as well as by what is after related, that they knew of the six hundred
men hid in the rock Rimmon:

seeing we have sworn by the Lord; by the Word of the Lord, as the
Targum; and such an oath with them was a sacred thing, and to be kept
inviolable, even to their own hurt:

that we will not give them of our daughters to wives; as in [Jdg
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md) and therefore they must either
marry among the Heathens, which was forbidden, or they must make void
their oath, or the tribe in a little time would be extinct; these were
difficulties they knew not how to surmount, and this was the object of
their inquiry.

[Judges 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 21:8</span></span>

And they said, what one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not
up to Mizpeh to the Lord?.... This is asked not only to bring them to
justice, and put them to death, according to their oath, who should be
found guilty, [Jdg 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005.md) but as an
expedient to find wives for the surviving Benjaminites; since these, as
they came not to Mizpeh, so consequently swore not that they would not
give their daughters to Benjaminites; wherefore from among them wives
might be given to them, without the violation of an oath:

and, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the
assembly; this was observed by some upon the question put, which caused
an inquiry to be made as after related. This city was in the land of
Gilead, from whence it had its name, on the other side Jordan, and is
placed by Adrichomius (a) in the half tribe of Manasseh; and Jerom (b)
says it was a village in his time six miles from the city Pella, upon a
mountain, as you go to Gerasa.

[Judges 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 21:9</span></span>

For the people were numbered,.... To know who did come up, and who did
not, and particularly to know whether the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead
did or not, against whom an information was brought:

and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there;
for as yet none that came had returned home; all came to Shiloh first,
to pay their devotion to the Lord; and as none were found among the
living, it did not appear they were among the slain; and very probably
the muster roll was taken before they went to battle, and they were not
on that.

[Judges 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 21:10</span></span>

And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
valiantest,.... That were in their army; in the Vulgate Latin version it
is only 10,000; but the Targum, Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions,
and Josephus (c), agree with the Hebrew text. This place, according to
Bunting, to which this army was sent, was fifty two miles from Shiloh
(d):

and commanded them, saying; these were the orders they gave them, when
they marched out:

go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword,
with the women and the children; which it seems was according to the
oath they had made, [Jdg 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005.md).

[Judges 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 21:11</span></span>

And this is the thing that ye shall do,.... Which they gave them in
charge to execute:

ye shall utterly destroy every male; without any reserve, young or old,
married or unmarried:

and every woman that hath lain by man; whether lawfully or unlawfully,
in a married or unmarried state.

[Judges 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 21:12</span></span>

And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young
virgins,.... Or damsel virgins (e); damsels that were virgins: that had
known no man by lying with any male: which was judged of by their age,
and by their unmarried state, and by common report, unless it can be
thought they were examined by matrons; but how it was that they were not
obliged, or did not think themselves obliged by their oath to put these
to death, as well as others, is not easy to say; whether they thought
the necessity of the case would excuse it, or they had a dispensation
from the Lord for it, on consulting him; however, so it was:

and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of
Canaan; this is observed because that Jabeshgilead was not in the land
of Canaan, from whence they were brought, but in the land of Og king of
Bashan; only what was on this side Jordan was the land of Canaan, and in
that Shiloh was, to which they were brought; and this shows that not the
city Bethel, but Shiloh, was the place whither the people or army of
Israel came to offer sacrifice after the war was ended.

[Judges 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 21:13</span></span>

And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of
Benjamin,.... Sent some messengers to them, to call them, and desire
them to come to them:

that were in the rock Rimmon; the six hundred men who had hid themselves
in a cave in it, of which the people of Israel were informed:

and to call peaceably unto them; to proclaim peace to them, and assure
them of it, and to let them know that they had no ill design against
them, that they might come safely to them, and would be kindly received
and protected by them.

[Judges 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 21:14</span></span>

And Benjamin came again at that time,.... The six hundred Benjaminites
returned with the messengers at the same time to the people of Israel,
putting confidence in the assurances they had given them of peace and
safety:

and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of
Jabeshgilead; in doing which they supposed they had not violated their
oath, since though they had sworn that they would not give their own
daughters, they had not sworn they would not give the daughters of
others; and besides, as the men of Jabeshgilead were not at Mizpeh when
the oaths were made, they had taken none, and so their daughters might
be given in marriage to the Benjaminites, notwithstanding that oath:

and yet so they sufficed them not; there were not wives enough for them
all; for they were six hundred men, whereas the daughters of the
inhabitants of Jabeshgilead were but four hundred, so that there were
two hundred more wanting. Abarbinel interprets the word we render "so"
in a different manner, by "right", as in [Num
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#007.md) and gives the sense thus, that it
was not a point of justice and judgment to do this to the daughters of
Jabeshgilead, namely, to save and give them in marriage; but they did
this because the people repented for Benjamin, as follows.

[Judges 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 21:15</span></span>

And the people repented them for Benjamin,.... That they had destroyed
all their women, and that they had saved no more of the daughters of
Jabeshgilead, not a sufficient number to be wives to the Benjaminites:

because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel; by almost
destroying one of them; for though this was done by the Israelites, yet
by the permission and according to the will of God, and through his
overruling providence.

[Judges 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 21:16</span></span>

Then the elders of the congregation said.... This being the case, that
there were not wives enough for them, they were obliged to consult
again, and consider of another expedient to provide for them; and this
motion came from the elders of the people, not only in years, but in
office:

how shall we do for wives for them that remain: the other two hundred,
who had none:

seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin? and so no wives to be
had there; and as for the Israelites which came to Mizpeh, who were of
all the tribes of Israel, they had solemnly sworn that they would not
give any of their daughters to them, and therefore it was a very
difficult thing to provide wives for them.

[Judges 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 21:17</span></span>

And they said, there must be an inheritance for them that be escaped
Benjamin,.... The escaped are the six hundred men in the rock Rimmon;
four hundred of them were supplied with wives, the other two wanted; and
as there was an inheritance divided by lot to the tribe of Benjamin, to
that tribe and to that only it belonged, and they must have it and no
other; it now of right devolved on these six hundred men, and them only,
and therefore provision must be made to increase their number, that they
may occupy the inheritance they have a right to, rebuild their cities,
till their land, cultivate their vineyards and oliveyards, and enjoy all
the advantages of their possessions:

that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel; but the full number of the
tribes be preserved, and their inheritances belonging to them, according
to the predictions of Jacob and Moses, and the assignment of them by lot
unto them by Joshua.

[Judges 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 21:18</span></span>

Howbeit, we may not give them wives of our daughters,.... Though their
case was so very necessitous and desperate:

for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, cursed be he that giveth
a wife to Benjamin, [Jdg 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md) and
therefore without the violation of their oath could not give any of
their daughters in marriage to them: wherefore some other way must be
devised to help them.

[Judges 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 21:19</span></span>

Then they said,.... Some of the elders that sat in council debating this
matter, and considering of ways and means to assist their brethren the
Benjaminites, and preserve their tribe from being lost:

behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly; where the
tabernacle then was, and before which the males of Israel were obliged
to appear three times of the year; and this was one of them, as is clear
by its being called a feast of the Lord; and therefore cannot design any
civil festival or fair kept for trade and commerce. Some have thought of
the feast of the passover, but it is most likely to be the feast of
tabernacles, as Abarbinel takes it to be; which in Jewish writings is
emphatically called "the feast"; and the time of year when that was kept
was a time of great rejoicing, on account of the fruits of the earth
being gathered in, and the reading of the law and especially at the
tithe of drawing of water at this feast; insomuch that it is said (e)
that he who never saw the rejoicing at drawing of water never saw
rejoicing in his life, which was attended with piping, and dancing, and
singing. It is pretty strange what Kimchi notes, that this may be either
one of the above feasts, or the day of atonement, at which, he says, the
daughters of Israel used to go and dance in the vineyards, according to
the words of the Rabbins; when though that is reckoned among the feasts,
[Lev 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001.md) it was properly a fast, as
it is called, [Act 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#009.md) and all tokens
of festivity and joy were forbidden on it; and where these words of
their Rabbins are to be met with, he says not: in a place

which is on the north side of Bethel; we rightly supply "in a place":
for the intention is not to describe the situation of Shiloh, which was
well known, but a place not far from it, where at this festival the
daughters of Shiloh used to dance:

on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem;
this place lay to the east of a public road, that led from Bethel to
Shechem:

and on the south of Lebonah; which Mr. Maundrell (f) takes to be a place
now called Kane Leban, which stands on the east side of a delightful
vale, having a village of the same name standing opposite to it on the
other side of the vale; one of these places, either that Kane or the
village, is supposed to be the Lebonah mentioned [Jdg
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019.md) to which both the name and
situation seem to agree.

[Judges 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 21:20</span></span>

Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin,.... The two hundred
men of the tribe that wanted wives; they ordered them as follows, and
which they spake with authority, being the elders of the congregation,
[Jdg 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#016.md).

saying, go and lie in wait in the vineyards; which might belong to
Shiloh, or it may be to Lebonah, which perhaps is the same with
Bethlaban, famous for its wine with the Misnic writers; who say (g) the
second places for wine are Bethrimah and Bethlaban; and I suspect that
Bethrimah is the same with Bethrimmon, near which was the rock Rimmon
these men were in; now this being the time of year when the vintage was
just over, the vines were full of branches and leaves, under which the
men might the better hide themselves; and the grapes being gathered,
there were no men in the vineyards, and so might lie in wait safely, and
under cover.

[Judges 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 21:21</span></span>

And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in
dances,.... As they used to do at this festival, not along with men, but
by themselves; and so might the more easily be taken and carried off;
and though only males were obliged to appear from all parts at this
feast, yet females might come if they would; and, no doubt, from
neighbouring places, at least many did; however, the daughters of
Shiloh, who dwelt where the tabernacle was, these always attended the
feast with demonstrations of joy, and among the rest with dancing, and
that as expressive of spiritual and religious joy, as in the case of
Miriam, and the Israelitish women, [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md) and as in latter times the most
religious men used to express their joy at this feast; now the two
hundred men in the vineyards, which lay near the field where these
virgins used to dance at this time, were to watch and observe when they
came out of the city thither, and were engaged in such an exercise:

then come ye out of the yards, and catch you every man his wife of the
daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin; they are directed
to rush out at once upon them, as they were dancing, secure, as they
thought, from molestation and danger; and they were to take everyone
one, not more, and go off directly with them to their own tribe.

[Judges 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 21:22</span></span>

And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to
complain,.... Of this rape of their daughters or sisters, or to bring an
action against them, and desire they might be summoned before them, the
elders of the people, and be tried and judged according to law for what
they had done; or to put them upon going to war with them again for such
treatment of them:

that we will say unto them, be favourable unto them for our sakes; for
the sake of the elders, who advised them to do what they did; or for the
sake of us Israelites, your sake and ours, who were too severe upon
them, and prosecuted the war with too much vigour, which made what they
have done necessary, or otherwise a tribe must have been lost in Israel:

because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war; either in the
war with Benjamin, which they carried on with such wrath and fury as to
destroy all the women, so that there were no wives left for the men that
remained, which they now repented of; or in the war with Jabeshgilead,
they did not reserve enough of the women taken, only four hundred
virgins, whereas there were six hundred men: but the first seems best:

for ye did not give unto them at this time, that you should be guilty;
the meaning is, that if they had any uneasiness upon their minds about
the oath which they had taken, not to give any of their daughters in
marriage to Benjamin, they need not be disturbed at that, since they did
not "give" them to them, but these "took" them by force; which was the
scheme these elders contrived to secure from the violation of the oath.
This they proposed to say to quiet them, and make them easy, to which
other things might have been added as that these were their brethren,
and not strangers they were married to, and not to mean men, but to men
of large estates, having the whole inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin
devolved upon them; and their daughters would be the original mothers of
the posterity of that tribe in succeeding ages.

[Judges 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 21:23</span></span>

And the children of Benjamin did so,.... Went and laid wait in the
vineyards, and when the daughters of Shiloh came out to dance, they
rushed upon them:

and took them wives according to their number; two hundred of them, each
man a wife, and no more; for though polygamy was in use in those times,
and if at any time necessary, and could be excused, it might seem now;
yet it was not indulged to, neither by the elders, nor by the children
of Benjamin:

of them that danced whom they caught; the rape of the Sabine virgins by
Romulus, at the arena plays and shows, mentioned by various authors (h),
and the carrying off of fifteen Spartan virgins from the dances by
Aristomenes the Messenian (i), are sometimes observed as parallel cases
to this, and justified by it, particularly that of Romulus (k):

and they went and returned unto their inheritance; the six hundred
Benjaminites, with their wives, returned to their own tribe, which was
their inheritance by lot; and these, being the only survivors, had a
right to the whole:

and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them: in process of time they
rebuilt the cities the Israelites had burnt in the late war, and
repeopled them as their posterity increased. And the Jewish writers say,
that in later times they were allowed to marry with other tribes as
before, since the oath only bound those present at Mizpeh; for they
observe, that it ran only:

there shall not any of us, &c. not any of our sons; they might give

[Judges 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 21:24</span></span>

And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to
his tribe and to his family,.... The war being ended, and things settled
as well as circumstances would admit of, for the preservation of the
tribe of Benjamin, who were the cause of it, and had suffered so much in
it; the Israelites that had met at Mizpeh, and who had not fallen in the
war, returned to their respective countries, to their wives and
children, and the business of their callings:

and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance; divided by
lot to them, to their estates and possessions, which each had a right
unto.

[Judges 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 21:25</span></span>

In those days there was no king in Israel,.... No supreme magistrate,
Joshua being dead, and as yet no judge in Israel had risen up; for all
related in the five last chapters of this book were done between the
death of Joshua and the time of the judges:

every man did that which was right in his own eyes; there being none to
restrain him from it, or punish him for it; and this accounts for the
many evil things related, as the idolatry of Micah and the Danites, the
base usage of the Levite's concubine, the extreme rigour and severity
with which the Israelites treated their brethren the Benjaminites, the
slaughter of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead, and the rape of the
daughters of Shiloh.
