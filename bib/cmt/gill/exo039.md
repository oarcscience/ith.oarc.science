INTRODUCTION TO EXODUS 39

In this chapter is continued the account of making the several things
belonging to the sanctuary, particularly the clothes for the service of
the tabernacle, and the garments of the priests, as the ephod and its
curious girdle, [Exo 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md) the
breastplate and the putting of the stones in it, and the fastening of it
to the ephod, [Exo 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#008.md) the robe of
the ephod, with the bells and pomegranates to it, [Exo
39:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#021.md) and the coats, mitre, bonnets,
breeches, and girdle of fine linen, for Aaron and his sons, [Exo
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#027.md) and the golden plate, [Exo
39:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#030.md) and all being finished, the
tabernacle and everything belonging to it were brought to Moses, and
viewed by him; who seeing that all was done exactly according to the
commandment of the Lord, blessed the people, and particularly the
artificers, [Exo 39:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#038.md).

[Exodus 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 39:1</span></span>

And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
service,.... Jarchi observes that there is no mention made of linen,
because these were not the priestly garments in which there was linen;
but these were they with which they covered the vessels of the sanctuary
when they journeyed; and so says Aben Ezra; and those were covered with
cloths of blue, purple, and scarlet, [Num
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005.md) though some think these were
clothes wore by the priests:

to do service in the holy place: and which they only wore when in it,
and employed in the service of it; and therefore what follows must be by
way of explanation:

and made the holy garments for Aaron, as the Lord commanded Moses; the
particulars of which are given in the following verses.

[Exodus 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 39:2</span></span>

And he made the ephod of gold,.... From hence to the end of verse thirty
one we have a very particular account of the making of the priest's
garments exactly according to the directions given to Moses; see Gill on
[Exo 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001.md) &c. to end of chapter twenty
eight; only it may be observed, that here in [Exo
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#003.md) an account is given of the manner
in which they made the gold fit to be worked along with the blue,
purple, and scarlet yarn; they beat the gold into thin plates, and then
cut them into wires, and then twisted them together with the yarn: the
gold that was used in the weaving of the ephod and the breastplate,
spoken of in the law, was wrought after this manner; the workman took
one thread of pure gold, and put it with six threads of blue, and
twisted the seven threads as one, and so he wrought a thread of gold
with six of purple, and another thread with six of scarlet, and another
with six of linen or flax, so that there were four threads of gold, and
all the threads were twenty eight, as it is said; "they did beat" or
spread out "the gold", &c. "to work in the midst of blue", &c. from
whence is learnt that the thread of gold was twisted in the midst of
them (y): and it may be further observed, that after the enumeration of
the stones in the breastplate, [Exo
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#010.md) no mention is made of the Urim
and Thummim, which seems to confirm the opinion of many, and which is my
own, that they are the same with the stones: moreover, in [Exo
39:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#028.md), it may be observed, that what
the coats for the common priests were made of is expressed, which is not
before, which was linen; expressive of their purity and holiness, and in
which they ought always to appear before God and man, and in which
apparel they have been imitated among the Heathens: the priests of
Hercules are said to be clothed with linen (z), and the Egyptian priests
wore only a linen garment (a); hence the priests of Isis, with whom she
is represented as surrounded by Juvenal (b), are called by him "grex
liniger", and by Martial, "linigeri" (c).

[Exodus 39:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 39:32</span></span>

Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation
finished,.... Both the tabernacle, consisting of the court, the holy
place, and the most holy place, and the tent or covering that was over
it, with all things appertaining to the service of it, as before
described:

and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded
Moses, so did they: both the people in general, and the artificers in
particular; the people brought gold, silver, and brass, &c. as was
proposed to them; and the artificers wrought these and all other things,
according to the directions and instructions they received.

[Exodus 39:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">exo 39:33</span></span>

And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses,.... That is, the several
parts of it before it was put together, with all its furniture, and
everything appertaining to it; which are examined in the order in which
they were directed to be made, from hence to the end of [Exo
39:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#042.md) and this was done, that Moses
might inspect the whole, and see whether it was done according to the
pattern shown him, and the instructions he had given to the workmen.

[Exodus 39:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">exo 39:43</span></span>

And Moses did look upon all the work,.... Made a survey of it, and with
great care and accuracy examined every particular thing, and the manner
in which it was finished:

and, behold, they had done it as the Lord had commanded, even so had
they done it; both as to matter and manner in every point, on all
accounts, just as they were ordered and directed; they being throughout
the whole filled by the Spirit of God with wisdom and understanding, to
do everything just as it was the will and pleasure of God it should be
done:

and Moses blessed them; commended them for what they had done, and
implored the divine blessing upon them; and which may be understood both
of the people who had so liberally and plentifully contributed to this
good work, and of the artificers who had so carefully and punctually
performed it. The form of blessing, as the Targum of Jonathan gives it,
is,"may the Shechinah (or the divine Majesty) of the Lord dwell in the
works of your hands;''or as Jarchi expresses it,"may it be the pleasure
(of God) that the Shechinah may dwell in the works of your hands, and
the beauty of the Lord our God may be upon us, &c.''which last words
were part of the prayer of Moses, [Psa
90:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#017.md).
