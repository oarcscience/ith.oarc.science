### [Psalms Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 13:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 13

To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David. According to Theodoret this
psalm was written by David, not when he fled from Saul, but from
Absalom; and gives this reason for it, what happened to him from Saul
was before his sin, and therefore he could speak with great boldness;
but what befell him from Absalom was after it, and therefore mourning
and groans were mixed with his words.

[Psalms 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 13:1</span></span>

How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever?.... When God does not
immediately deliver his people from their enemies, or help them out of
an affliction; when he does not discover his love, communicate his
grace, apply the blessings and promises of his covenant as usual; and
when he does not visit them in his usual manner, and so frequently as he
has formerly done, they are ready to conclude he has forgotten them; and
sometimes this continues long, and then they fear they are forgotten for
ever; and this they cannot bear, and therefore expostulate with God in a
querulous manner, as the psalmist does here; but this is to be
understood not in reality, but in their own apprehension, and in the
opinion of their enemies; God never does nor can forget his people;
oblivion does not fall upon him with respect to common persons and
things; and much less with respect to his own dear children, for whom a
special book of remembrance is written; See Gill on [Psa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md);

how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? his love, and the
manifestation of it, from his person; his gracious presence, the light
of his smiling countenance, which sometimes God hides or withdraws from
his people by way of resentment of their unbecoming carriage to him; and
which is very distressing to them, for they are apt to imagine it is in
wrath and hot displeasure, when he still loves them, and will with
everlasting kindness have mercy on them; see [Isa
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md). The Targum renders it, "the
glory of thy face".

[Psalms 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 13:2</span></span>

How long shall I take counsel in my soul,.... Or "put it" (s); to take
counsel of good men and faithful friends, in matters of moment and
difficulty, is safe and right; and it is best of all to take counsel of
God, who is wonderful in it, and guides his people with it; but nothing
is worse than for a man to take counsel of his own heart, or only to
consult himself; for such counsel often casts a man down, and he is
ashamed of it sooner or later: but this seems not to be the sense here;
the phrase denotes the distressing circumstances and anxiety of mind the
psalmist was in; he was at his wits' end, and cast about in his mind,
and had various devises and counsels formed there; and yet knew not what
way to take, what course to steer;

having sorrow in my heart daily; by reason of God's hiding his face from
him; on account of sin that dwelt in him, or was committed by him;
because of his distance from the house of God, and the worship and
ordinances of it; and by reason of his many enemies that surrounded him
on every side: this sorrow was an heart sorrow, and what continually
attended him day by day; or was in the daytime, when men are generally
amused with business or diversions, as well as in the night, as Kimchi
observes;

how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? even the vilest of men,
[Psa 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#008.md); this may be understood
either of temporal enemies, and was true of David when he was obliged
not only to leave his own house and family, but the land of Judea, and
flee to the Philistines; and when he fled from Absalom his son, lest he
should be taken and slain by him; or of spiritual enemies, and is true
of saints when sin prevails and leads captive, and when the temptations
of Satan succeed; as when he prevailed upon David to number the people,
Peter to deny his master, &c. The Jewish writers (t) observe that here
are four "how longs", answerable to the four monarchies, Babylonian,
Persian, Grecian, and Roman, and their captivities under them.

[Psalms 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 13:3</span></span>

Consider and hear me, O Lord my God,.... The psalmist amidst all his
distresses rightly applies to God by prayer, claims his interest in him
as his covenant God, which still continued notwithstanding all his
darkness, desertions, and afflictions; and entreats him to "consider"
his affliction and trouble, and deliver him out of it; to consider his
enemies, how many and mighty they were; and his own weakness his frame,
that he was but dust, and unable to stand against them: or to "look" (u)
upon his affliction, and upon him under it, with an eye of pity and
compassion; to have respect to him and to his prayers, and to turn unto
him, and lift up the light of his countenance upon him: and so this
petition is opposed to the complaint in [Psa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md); and he further requests that he
would "hear" him; that is, so as to answer him, and that immediately,
and thereby show that he had not forgotten him, but was mindful of him,
of his love to him, and covenant with him;

lighten mine eyes: meaning either the eyes of his body, which might be
dim and dull through a failure of the animal spirits, by reason of
inward grief, outward afflictions, or for want of bodily food; which
when obtained refreshes nature, cheers the animal spirits, enlightens or
gives a briskness to the eyes; see [Sa1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027.md); or else the eyes of his
understanding, [Eph 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md); that he
might behold wondrous things in the law of God, know the things which
were freely given to him of God, see more clearly his interest in him,
and in the covenant of his grace, and have his soul refreshed and
comforted with the light of God's countenance; and he be better able to
discern his enemies, and guard against them; and be directed to take the
best method to be delivered and secured from them. The people of God are
sometimes in the dark, and see no light; especially when benighted, and
in sleepy frames; and it is God's work to enlighten and quicken them;

lest I sleep the sleep of death; a natural death (w), which is
comparable to sleep, and often expressed by it; and which sense agrees
with lightening the eyes of his body, as before explained; or rather the
sense is, lift up the light of thy countenance, revive thy work in the
midst of the years; let me see thy goodness in the land of the living,
that I may not faint and sink and die away. Or it may be an eternal
death is designed; for though true believers shall never die this death,
yet they may be in such circumstances, as through unbelief to fear they
shall. The Targum paraphrases the word thus;

"enlighten mine eyes in thy law, lest I sin, and sleep with those who
are guilty of death.''

[Psalms 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 13:4</span></span>

Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him,.... Which is an
argument God takes notice of; and for which reason he does not give up
his people into the hands of their enemies; see [Deu
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027.md). The Chaldee paraphrase
interprets this of the evil imagination or corruption of nature, and
represents it as a person, as the Apostle Paul does in [Rom
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015.md); and which may be said to
prevail, when it pushes on to sin, and hinders doing good, and carries
captive; and it may be applied to Satan, the great enemy of God's
people, who triumphs over them, when he succeeds in his temptations;

and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved; meaning from his
house and family, from his country and kingdom, from a prosperous state
and condition to a distressed one; at which the troublers of David's
peace would rejoice. They that trouble the saints are sin, Satan, and
the world; and the two last rejoice when they are in an uncomfortable
and afflicted condition; and especially Satan rejoices when he gains his
point, if it is but to move them from any degree of steadfastness, of
faith and hope, or from the ways of God in any respect: the Targum adds,
"from thy ways"; for to be moved so as to perish eternally they cannot,
being built upon the Rock of ages, and surrounded by the power and grace
of God.

[Psalms 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 13:5</span></span>

But I have trusted in thy mercy,.... The faith, hope, and comfort of the
psalmist grew and increased by prayer; from complaining he goes to
praying, from praying to believing; he trusted not in himself, not in
his own heart, nor in his own righteousness and merits, but in the mercy
of God; and not in the bare absolute mercy of God, but in the grace and
goodness of God, as the word (x) here used signifies, as it is displayed
in the plenteous redemption which is by Christ; which is a sufficient
ground of faith and hope; see [Psa
130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007.md);

my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation; which God is the contriver,
author, and giver of, and in which the glory of his perfections is so
greatly displayed: and a true believer rejoices more on account that God
is glorified by it than because of his own interest in it; and this joy
is an inward one, it is joy in the heart, and is real and unfeigned, and
is what continues, and will be felt and expressed both here and
hereafter.

[Psalms 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 13:6</span></span>

I will sing unto the Lord,.... In prayer faith is encouraged, through
believing the heart is filled with joy; and this joy is expressed by the
lips, in songs of praise to the Lord, ascribing the glory of salvation
to him, and giving him thanks for every mercy and blessing of life;

because he hath dealt bountifully with me; both in a way of providence
and grace, granting life and preserving it, and supporting with the
comforts of it; blessing with spiritual blessings, and crowning with
loving kindness and tender mercies; all which is generous and bountiful
dealing, and affords a just occasion of praise and thanksgiving; see
[Psa 116:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007.md).
