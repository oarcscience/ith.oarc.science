INTRODUCTION TO JONAH

This book, in the Hebrew copies, is called "Sepher Jonah", the Book of
Jonah; by the Vulgate Latin version "the Prophecy of Jonah": and in the
Syriac version "the Prophecy of the Prophet Jonah". His name signifies a
dove, derived from a root which signifies to oppress; because it is a
creature liable to oppression, and to become the prey of others.
Hillerus (a) derives the word from a root which signifies to be "fair"
and "beautiful", as this creature is This name is very suitable to a
prophet and minister of the Lord, who ought to be wise as serpents, and
harmless as doves; and who mourn over their own sins, and the sins of
others. Jonah did not always in, his conduct answer to his name,
particularly when he was so angry at the Lord's sparing the Ninevites,
and so impatient for the loss of his gourd. His father's name was
Amittai, as in [Jon 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md) and in [Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md); from whence it also appears
that he was of Gathhepher, a town in the tribe of Zebulun, [Jos
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013.md); and was a part of Galilee, [Isa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md); and so R. Jochanan, in Abendana,
affirms, that he was of the tribe of Zebulun, and of Gathhepher, which
was in that tribe; which confutes that notion of the Pharisees in the
times of Christ, that no prophet came out of Galilee, [Joh
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052). The Jews (b.md) have a tradition
that his mother was the widow of Sarepta, whose son Elijah raised from
the dead, which was this prophet; and who is said to be the son of
Amittai, that is, "truth": because his mother thereby knew and believed
that the word of the Lord in the mouth of Elijah was truth, [Kg1
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#023.md); but his being a Hebrew
contradicts him, [Jon 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009.md); for Sarepta
was a city of Sidon, and he must have been a Sidonian if born of her,
and not a Hebrew: but, be this as it will, it is certain he was a
prophet of the Lord; and this book, which bears his name, and very
probably was written by him, its divine authority is confirmed by the
testimony Christ, of whom Jonah was a type; see [Mat
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039.md); and indeed the principal design
of this book is to set forth in himself the type of the death and
resurrection of Christ, by his being three days in the whale's belly,
and then delivered from it; and to declare the grace and mercy of God to
repenting sinners, and to signify the calling of the Gentiles after the
death and resurrection of Christ; and is a very profitable book to
instruct us about the power and goodness of God; the nature of
repentance, and the effects of it; the imperfection and infirmities of
the best of men in this life; and the call and mission of the ministers
of the word, and the necessity of their conformity and attendance to it.
Cyprian the martyr was converted from idolatry by hearing this prophecy
read and explained by Caecilius. If this prophet was the son of the
widow of Sarepta, or the person Elisha sent to anoint Jehu, according to
the tradition of the Jews (c), he was born in the times of Ahab, and
lived in the reigns of Joram and Jehu; and, according to Bishop Lloyd
(d), he prophesied in the latter end, of Jehu's reign; where Mr. Whiston
(e) also places him, about 860 B.C.; or in the beginning of the reign of
Jehoahaz, when Israel was greatly oppressed by Hazael king of Syria,
[Kg2 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022.md); at which time he might
prophesy of the victories and success of Jeroboam the second, and
grandson of Jehoahaz, [Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md); and,
if so, he is more ancient than Isaiah, Hosea, Amos, Joel, and Micah,
whose contemporary he is generally thought to be Pseudo-Epiphanius (f),
as he gives a wrong account of the place of the birth of this prophet,
so of the place of his burial; which he makes to be in the land of Saar,
and in the cave of Kenan, the father of Caleb and Othniel; but it is
more likely that he died and was buried at Geth, where he was born; and
where Jerom (g) says his grave was, shown in his time, about two miles
from Zippore, in the way to Tiberias; with which account Isidore (h)
agrees; and so Benjamin Tudelensis (i) says, his sepulchre was on a hill
near Zippore. Monsieur Thevenot (k) says, not far from Nazareth the tomb
of Jonah is now to be seen, to which the Turks bear a great respect.
