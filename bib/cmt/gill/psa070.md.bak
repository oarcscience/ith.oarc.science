INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 70

To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. This
psalm, according to Kimchi, was composed by David when he fled from
Saul, or from Absalom; so Theodoret; but if at either of those times, it
is most likely to be the latter, since the following psalm, it is
certain, was penned when he was an old man, [Psa
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md); the word translated "to bring to
remembrance" is thought, by Aben Ezra, to be the first word of some
pleasant song; see [Psa 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md). The
Targum paraphrases it, to remember the use of the frankincense; alluding
to [Lev 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002.md); Jarchi says it signifies
prayer, and refers to [Psa 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md), as
instances of the use of the word in such a sense; and so this psalm is
composed by the psalmist in a petitionary way, to put the Lord in
remembrance of his afflictions, and of his promises of help and
deliverance, which he prays for; see [Psa
132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md); and that he would avenge him on
his enemies, and show respect to his friends; or it was written to
refresh his own memory with his present state, and to put him in mind
from whence he might expect help and salvation. The title of the psalm
in the Arabic version is, and so in the Vulgate Latin, following the
Septuagint,

"a remembrance that the Lord had saved him:''

and in the Syriac version,

"a psalm of David as to the letter, when he sent Joab to take Shemuah
(Sheba), who rebelled; also a supplication of the righteous, and even of
Christ himself.''

And seeing this follows upon the preceding, and may be reckoned an
appendix to it, and there are some things in it which manifestly refer
to the latter part of that, and the whole is detached from the fortieth
psalm, with which it agrees, a few words only excepted, which manifestly
belongs to the Messiah; it is right to understand this of him; [Psa
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 70:1</span></span>

Make haste, O God, to deliver me,.... The phrase, "make haste", is
supplied from the following clause in [Psa
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013.md); it is, "be pleased, O Lord", or
"Jehovah". The Targum renders it, "to deliver us"; very wrongly;

make haste to help me, O Lord; See Gill on [Psa
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019.md).

[Psalms 70:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 70:2</span></span>

Let them be ashamed and confounded,.... In [Psa
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md) it is added, "together"; See
Gill on [Psa 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md);

that seek after my soul; or "life"; in [Psa
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md) it is added, "to destroy it";
for that was the end of their seeking after it;

let them be turned backward, &c. See Gill on [Psa
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md).

[Psalms 70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 70:3</span></span>

Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame,.... In [Psa
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015.md) it is, "let them be desolate";
which seems to respect their land and houses, here their persons; See
Gill on [Psa 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015.md);

that say; in [Psa 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015.md) it is added,
"to me"; not to his people, but himself,

aha, aha: rejoicing at his calamity and distress. The Targum is,

"we are glad, we are glad;''

See Gill on [Psa 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015.md), and compare
with this [Eze 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 70:4</span></span>

Let all those that seek thee,.... The Targum is,

"that seek doctrine (or instruction) from thee.''

rejoice and be glad in thee; the Targum paraphrases it,

"rejoice and be glad in thy word.''

and let such as love thy salvation say continually, let God be
magnified; the Targum is,

"let the glory of the Lord be increased;''

and in [Psa 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md), instead of "God",
it is "the Lord", or "Jehovah": See Gill on [Psa
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 70:5</span></span>

But I am poor and needy,.... In [Psa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md) it follows, yet "the Lord
thinketh on me"; instead of which it is here; see Gill on [Psa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md);

make haste unto me, O God; which repeats for sense the same petition as
in [Psa 71:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#001.md);

thou art my help and my deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying; in [Psa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md) it is, "O my God".
