INTRODUCTION TO JUDGES 10

This chapter gives an account of two judges of Israel, in whose days
they enjoyed peace, [Jdg 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md), after
which they sinning against God, came into trouble, and were oppressed by
their enemies eighteen years, and were also invaded by an army of the
Ammonites, [Jdg 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md), when they cried
unto the Lord for deliverance, confessing their sin; but he had first
refused to grant them any, though upon their importunity and reformation
he had compassion on them, [Jdg 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010.md)
and the chapter is concluded with the preparation made by both armies
for a battle, [Jdg 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md).

[Judges 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 10:1</span></span>

And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel,.... To save, deliver,
and protect Israel; which does not necessarily imply that Abimelech did;
for he was no judge of God's raising up, or the people's choosing, but
usurped a kingly power over them; and was so far from saving and
defending them, that he involved them in trouble and distress, and ruled
over them in a tyrannical manner, and left them in the practice of
idolatry: it only signifies that after his death arose a person next
described to which this may well be attributed, that he was raised up as
a judge by the Lord; and though we read of no enemies particularly, that
he delivered the people from in his days, yet it is not impossible nor
unlikely that there might be such, though not made mention of; besides,
he might be said to save them, as the word signifies, in that he was an
happy instrument of composing those differences and dissensions, which
Abimelech had occasioned, and of recovering them from the idolatry they
had fallen into in his times, and of protecting them in their liberties,
civil and religious: and this was

Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; he was of the
tribe of Issachar, and bore the same name as the eldest son of Issachar
did, as his father Puah had the name of the second son of Issachar, [Ch1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md) and as for Dodo his grandfather,
this is elsewhere mentioned as the name of a man, as it doubtless is
here, [Sa2 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#009.md) though some copies of
the Targum, the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, render it, the
son of his uncle, or father's brother; meaning that his father Puah was
the son of Abimelech's uncle, or father's brother, and so was one of the
family which was raised up to be a judge after his death; but it is not
likely that Gideon, the father of Abimelech, and Puah, the father of
this man, should be brethren, when the one was of the tribe of Manasseh,
and the other of the tribe of Issachar:

and he dwelt in Shamir in Mount Ephraim: that is, when he became judge
in Israel he removed to this place, as being in the midst of the tribes,
and near the tabernacle of Shiloh, and so fit for a judge to reside in,
to whom the people might apply from all parts to have justice and
judgment administered to them. It is called Shamir in Mount Ephraim, to
distinguish it from another of the same name in the mountain of Judah,
[Jos 15:48](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048.md) it seems to have its name
from the thorns which grew about it.

[Judges 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 10:2</span></span>

And he judged Israel twenty three years, and died,.... He did not take
upon him to be king, as Abimelech did, but acted as a judge, in which
office he continued twenty three years, and faithfully discharged it,
and died in honour:

and was buried in Shamir; the place where he executed his office. It is
said (t), that in the first year of Tola, the son of Puah, Priamus
reigned in Troy.

\(t\) Juchasin, fol. 136. 1.

[Judges 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 10:3</span></span>

And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite,.... Who was of the half tribe of
Manasseh, on the other side Jordan, which inhabited the land of Gilead,
and who is the first of the judges that was on that side Jordan; it
pleased God, before the government was settled in a particular tribe, to
remove it from one to another, and to honour them all, and to show that
though the two tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
were separated from their brethren by the river Jordan, they were not
neglected by the Lord; and generally speaking judges were raised up in
all those parts which were most oppressed, and liable to be oppressed by
their enemies, as Gilead by the Ammonites; wherefore this, and the next
judge that followed him, Jephthah, were of Gilead:

and judged Israel twenty two years; protected them from their enemies,
administered justice to them, and preserved them in the true religion.

[Judges 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 10:4</span></span>

And he had thirty sons that rode upon thirty ass colts,.... Which to
ride on in those times was reckoned honourable, and on which judges rode
in their circuit, [Jdg 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#010.md) and such
might be these sons of Jair, who were appointed under him to ride about,
and do justice in the several parts of the country, as Samuel's sons
were judges under him, [Sa1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001.md),

and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day,
which are in the land of Gilead; or the villages of Jair. There were
some of this name that belonged to Jair, a son of Manasseh, in the times
of Moses, [Num 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md) and these may be
the same, at least some of them; for they were but twenty three he had,
whereas these were thirty, [Ch1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#022.md)
and these coming by inheritance to this Jair, a descendant of the
former, and he being of the same name, and these cities perhaps repaired
and enlarged by him, the name of them was continued and established, for
it is not reasonable to suppose, as some have done, that this is the
same Jair that lived in the times of Moses, who, if so, must have lived
more than three hundred years, an age men did not live to in those
times.

[Judges 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 10:5</span></span>

And Jair died, and was buried in Camon. A city of Gilead, as Josephus
(u) calls it; Jerom (w), under this word Camon, makes mention of a
village in his times, called Cimana, in the large plain six miles from
Legion to the north, as you go to Ptolemais; but, as Reland (x)
observes, this seems not to be the same place, but rather this is the
Camon Polybius (y) speaks of among other cities of Peraea, taken by
Antiochus.

[Judges 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 10:6</span></span>

And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord,....
After the death of the above judges they fell into idolatry again, as
the following instances show:

and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth; as they had before; see Gill on [Jdg
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md), [Jdg
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013.md) and, besides these:

also the gods of Syria; their gods and goddesses, Belus and Saturn,
Astarte and the Dea Syria, Lucian writes of:

and the gods of Zidon; the goddess of the Zidonians was Ashtaroth, [Kg1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md) and it seems they had other
deities:

and the gods of Moab; the chief of which were Baalpeor and Chemosh, [Num
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003.md).

and the gods of the children of Ammon, as Milcom or Molech, [Kg1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md).

and the gods of the Philistines; as Dagon the god of Ashdod, Beelzebub
the god of Ekron, Marnas the god of Gaza, and Derceto the goddess of
Ashkalon:

and forsook the Lord, and served not him; not even in conjunction with
the above deities, as Jarchi and others observe; at other times, when
they worshipped other gods, they pretended to worship the Lord also,
they served the creature besides the Creator; but now they were so
dreadfully sunk into idolatry, that they had wholly forsaken the Lord
and his worship at the tabernacle, and made no pretensions to it, but
entirely neglected it.

[Judges 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 10:7</span></span>

And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel,.... His anger burned
like fire, he was exceedingly incensed against them, nothing being more
provoking to him than idolatry, as after mentioned:

and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands
of the children of Ammon; that is, delivered them into their hands, and
they became subject and were in bondage to them, as such are that are
sold for "slaves"; part of them, that lay to the west of the land of
Israel, fell into the hands of the Philistines; and another part, which
lay to the east, were oppressed by the children of Ammon, particularly
those that were on the other side Jordan came into the hands of the
latter.

[Judges 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 10:8</span></span>

And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel,.... The
Philistines on one side, and the children of Ammon on the other; meaning
either that year in which Jair died, as Jarchi; or the first year they
began to bring them into bondage, as R. Isaiah: "and from that year", as
Kimchi and Ben Melech, that they vexed and distressed them, they
continued to vex and distress them

eighteen years; or, as Abarbinel interprets it, "with that year", they
vexed and oppressed them eighteen years, that is, so many more, or
reckoning that into the number of them; and these eighteen years of
their oppression are not to be reckoned into the years of Jair's
government, and as commencing from the fourth of it, as Bishop Usher,
Lightfoot, and others; for it does not appear that there was any
oppression in his days, but from the time of his death to the raising up
of Jephthah a new judge: and the people oppressed by the children of
Ammon during that time

were all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan, in
the land of the Ammonites, which is in Gilead; even the tribes of Reuben
and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

[Judges 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 10:9</span></span>

Moreover, the children of Ammon passed over Jordan,.... Not content with
the oppression of the tribes on the other side Jordan, which had
continued eighteen years, they came over Jordan into the land of Canaan
to ravage that, and bring other of the tribes into subjection to them,
particularly the three next mentioned, which lay readiest for them, when
they were come over Jordan:

to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house
of Ephraim who lay to the south and the southeast of the land of Canaan,
and were the first the Ammonites had to fight with and subdue, when they
had crossed Jordan to the east of it:

so that Israel was sore distressed; by the Ammonites in the east,
threatening those three tribes, mentioned, and the Philistines on the
west, who gave disturbance to the tribes that lay nearest them, as
Asher, Zebulun, Naphtali, Issachar, and Dan; and this distress was begun
the same year in different parts, by different enemies.

[Judges 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 10:10</span></span>

And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord,.... In this their
distress, seeing nothing but ruin and destruction before their eyes,
their land being invaded by such powerful enemies in different quarters;
this opened their eyes to a sense of their sins, the cause of it, and
brought them to a confession of them:

saying, we have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our
God, and also served Baalim; had been guilty not only of sins of
omission, neglecting the pure of God, but also of sins of commission,
even gross idolatry, in serving Baalim, and other gods, before
mentioned.

[Judges 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 10:11</span></span>

And the Lord said unto the children of Israel,.... By a prophet he sent
unto them, as Kimchi and Abarbinel, see [Jdg
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008.md), whom Ben Gersom takes to be
Phinehas, but he could not be living at this time; or by an angel, a
created one, sent on this occasion; or the uncreated one, the Son and
Word of God, who might appear in an human form, and to whom all that is
here said is applicable:

did not I deliver you from the Egyptians; by bringing them out of
subjection and bondage to them, and by delivering them out of their
hands at the Red sea:

and from the Amorites; the kings of Sihon and Og, whose countries were
taken from them, and put into their hands, when they attempted to stop
them in their march to the land of Canaan:

from the children of Ammon; when they joined with the Moabites against
them, [Jdg 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md).

and from the Philistines? in the times of Shamgar, [Jdg
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md).

[Judges 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 10:12</span></span>

The Zidonians also,.... Who were left in the land to distress them,
though there is no particular mention of them, and of the distress they
gave them, and of their deliverance from it, which yet is not at all to
be questioned:

and the Amalekites; both quickly after they came out of Egypt, [Exo
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#013.md) and when they were come into the
land of Canaan, joining the Moabites and the Midianites against them,
[Jdg 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md).

and the Maonites did oppress you; meaning either the old inhabitants of
Maon, a city in the mountains of Judah, near to which was a wilderness
of this name, [Jos 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055.md) or rather a
people of Arabia, called by Strabo (z), and Diodorus Siculus (a),
Minaeans, the same with Mehunim, mentioned with the Arabians, [Ch2
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007.md) and who perhaps came along with
the Midianites, when they oppressed Israel; though some have thought of
the old inhabitants of Bethmeon and Baalmeon, [Num
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038.md).

and ye cried unto me, and I delivered you out of their hands; all those
mercies and deliverances are mentioned to aggravate their sins, that
notwithstanding the Lord hath so often and eminently appeared for them,
yet they deserted him and his worship, and fell into idolatry. Jarchi
observes, that here are seven salvations or deliverances mentioned in
opposition to the seven sorts of false gods or idols they had served,
[Jdg 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md).

\(z\) Geograph. l. 16. p. 528. (a) Bibliothec. l. 3. p. 176.

[Judges 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 10:13</span></span>

Ye have forsaken me, and served other gods,.... Since they had been so
remarkably saved, time after time, and delivered from so many powerful
enemies, which was dreadful ingratitude:

wherefore I will deliver you no more; which is not to be understood
absolutely, since after this he did deliver them, but conditionally,
unless they repented of their idolatries, and forsook them. This is said
to bring them to a sense of their sin and danger.

[Judges 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 10:14</span></span>

Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen,.... For they were their
choice, and not what they were obliged to serve through persecution, and
by compulsion of others, and whom they needed not, having the Lord
Jehovah to be their God; and they are bid not seriously, but in an
ironical or sarcastic way, to call upon them for help in this their time
of distress, in whose power it was not to relieve them:

let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation; if they can, whom
you have served in your prosperity.

[Judges 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 10:15</span></span>

And the children of Israel said unto the Lord, we have sinned,.... By
serving other gods particularly; and they seemed to have a true sense of
their sin, and their confessions of it to be ingenuous, by what follows:

do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; inflict what
punishment he would upon them, as famine or pestilence, they could not
but own it would be just and righteous, and what their sins deserved:

deliver us only, we pray thee, this day; out of the hands of men; they
chose rather to fall into the hands of God; and however he thought fit
to deal with them, they entreated that this once he would save them out
of the hands of their enemies.

[Judges 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 10:16</span></span>

And they put away the strange gods from among them,.... Which was an
evidence of the truth of their repentance, and showed their confessions
and humiliations to be genuine:

and served the Lord; and him only, both in private and public; in the
observance of duties, both moral and ceremonial; in an attendance on the
service of the sanctuary, and by offering sacrifices to God there,
according to his will:

and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel; which is to be
understood after the manner of men; for grief properly does not belong
to God, there being no passion in him; but it denotes a carriage or
behaviour of his, which shows what looks like sympathy in men; a love
and affection for Israel, notwithstanding their ill behaviour to him,
and a change of his dispensations Providence towards them, according to
his unchangeable will; so Maimonides (b) understands it of the good will
and pleasure of God, to cease from afflicting the people of Israel; but
Abarbinel is of opinion that this refers to the soul of Israel, which
was shortened and contracted, as the word signifies, because of the
labour of servitude, the affliction and distress they were in.

\(b\) Moreh Nevochim, par. 1. c. 41.

[Judges 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 10:17</span></span>

Then the children of Ammon were gathered together,.... By a crier, as
Jarchi; they had passed over Jordan, as in [Jdg
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#009.md) and had been distressing three of
the tribes of Israel on that side; but now being informed, by an herald
at arms, that the children of Israel, on the other side Jordan, were
risen up in defence of their country, rights, and liberties, the
children of Ammon came back and crossed over Jordan again:

and encamped in Gilead; in the land of Gilead, part of which belonged to
the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the other part to the half tribe of
Manasseh:

and the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped
at Mizpeh: of which name there were several cities in the land of
Israel, on both sides Jordan; this must design a place on the other side
Jordan, either in the tribe of Gad or Manasseh, for it seems there was
of this name in each, see [Gen 31:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#049.md).

[Judges 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 10:18</span></span>

And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another,.... Being thus
assembled and encamped:

what man is he that will begin to fight with the children of Ammon? for
though the forces were assembled together for battle, yet it seems they
had no general to command them, and lead them on to it:

he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead, this they ordered
to be proclaimed, to encourage some person to take the command of them,
and go before them to battle, promising him that he should be judge or
governor over all the tribes on that side Jordan.
