INTRODUCTION TO NUMBERS

This book has its name from the account it gives of the "numbers" of the
children of Israel, twice taken particularly; which name it has with
this Greeks and Latins, and so with the Syriac and Arabic versions; but
with the Jews it is called sometimes "Vajedabber", from the first word
of it, "and the Lord spake"; and sometimes "Bemidbar", from the fifth
word of the first verse, "in the wilderness", and sometimes "Sepher
Pikkudim"; or, as with Origen (a), "Ammesphâ€škodim", the book of
musters or surveys. That it was written by Moses is not to be doubted;
and is indeed suggested by our Lord himself, [Joh
5:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046.md) compared with [Num
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014.md), and the references to it, in the
New Testament, fully ascertain to us Christians the authenticity of it,
as that of our Lord hinted at, and those of the apostle in [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md). It contains an history of the
affairs of the Israelites, and of their travel in the wilderness for the
space of thirty eight years; though the principal facts it relates were
done in the second year of their coming out of Egypt, and in the last of
their being in the wilderness; and it is not merely historical, but
gives a particular account of several laws, ceremonial and judicial, to
be observed by the people of Israel, as well as has many things in it
very instructive, both of a moral and evangelical nature.
