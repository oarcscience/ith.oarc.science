### [Joshua Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 9:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO JOSHUA 9

This chapter gives an account of the combination of the several kings of
Canaan against Israel, [Jos 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md); and
of the craftiness of the Gibeonites, pretending they were ambassadors
from a far country, and desired to enter into a league with Israel,
which they obtained, [Jos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003.md); but
when it was discovered who they were, it occasioned a murmuring among
the people, [Jos 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#016.md); which the
princes quelled by proposing to make them hewers of wood, and drawers of
water, [Jos 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#019.md); in order to which
Joshua summoned them before him, and chided them for beguiling them; and
after they had made their excuse, he ordered them to the service the
princes proposed, and so peace in the congregation of Israel was
preserved, [Jos 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021.md).

[Joshua 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 9:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side
Jordan,.... On the side Israel now were, and was that in which the land
of Canaan lay, and was now governed by many kings, and all that were now
remaining, even all but the kings of Jericho and Ai, who were slain:
both those

in the hills, and in the valleys; that dwelt in the mountainous part of
the country, and in the plains of it:

and in all the coasts of the great sea, over against Lebanon; who
inhabited and governed in that part of the country which lay on the
coast of the Mediterranean sea, the country of Phoenicia, in which were
Tyre, Sidon, and other cities, and were over against Mount Lebanon,
which was on the northern part of the country; according to the Latin
version, they dwelt near Lebanon; and according to the Septuagint, near
Antilibanus. It seems best, with Noldius (g), to render the words, "even
unto Lebanon", for it designs all the sea coasts reaching to it; for all
the maritime coasts did not lie over against it:

the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite,
and the Jebusite, heard thereof; what they heard is not said, but to be
understood; particularly they heard what had been done by Joshua, and
the people of Israel, to Jericho and Ai: and their kings, [Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003.md). Some think, as Abarbinel, that
they had heard of the altar Joshua had made, and of the stones he had
set up, and of his reading the law to the people, by which they were to
be governed; all which they understood as taking possession of the
country, and looking upon it as conquered, and obliging his people to
swear fealty to him. All the nations of Canaan are mentioned but the
Gergasites; which, according to the Jewish writers, are omitted, because
they were but few; the Septuagint version has them in some copies.

[Joshua 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 9:2</span></span>

That they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua,

and with Israel,.... Not at this time, but they met together to consult
what was proper to be done in order to secure themselves, and their
people, and put a stop to the successes of the arms of Israel; and for
this purpose entered into alliances with each other to assist one
another, or at a convenient time and place to join their forces
together, and attack Israel, as afterwards they did, [Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md); and this they did

with one accord; were unanimous in their councils and resolutions; they
all confederated together, and agreed as one man to make a common cause
of it, and oppose Israel with their united forces.

[Joshua 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 9:3</span></span>

And when the inhabitants of Gibeon,.... A large and royal city, a
metropolitan one, which had three others belonging to it, and under it,
mentioned [Jos 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017.md); see [Jos
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#002.md); no mention is made of any king
over them, perhaps they were governed by elders, [Jos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#011). Though an Arabic writer (h.md)
says, the king of Gibeon wrote to Joshua, and desired security, and sent
him large gifts, whom having preserved in safety, Joshua placed on his
throne: when these

heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai; had taken the one in a
miraculous way, and the other by a stratagem, and had burnt them both,
destroyed the inhabitants, plundered their substance, and slew both
their kings, all which struck them with terror.

[Joshua 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 9:4</span></span>

And they did work wilily,.... Acted craftily, dealt in much cunning and
subtlety; our version leaves out a very emphatic word, "also"; they
also, as well as other nations, acted a cunning part, but in a different
way; they did not enter into consultations and alliances with others,
how to defend themselves, but made use of a stratagem to make peace, and
enter into a league with Israel; or also as the Israelites had done,
either as Simeon and Levi had dealt craftily with the Shechemites, who
were Hivites, [Gen 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002.md); so now the
Gibeonites, who also were Hivites, [Jos
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#007.md); wrought in a wily and crafty
manner with them, so Jarchi; or as the Israelites had lately done in the
affair of Ai:

and went and made as if they had been ambassadors: from some states in a
foreign country, sent on an embassy to the people of Israel, to
compliment them on their successes, and to enter into alliance with
them, which they thought would be pleasing and acceptable to them; the
Targum is,"they prepared food,''which they took with them for their
journey; and so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic
versions:

and took old sacks upon their asses: in which they put, their
provisions:

and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up: not made of glass, as
ours usually are, but of the skins of beasts, as the bottles in the
eastern countries commonly were; which in time grew old, and were rent
and burst, and they were obliged to mend them, and bind them up, that
they might hold together, and retain the liquor put into them, see [Mat
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#017.md).

[Joshua 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 9:5</span></span>

And old shoes and clouted upon their feet,.... Which being worn out,
were patched with various pieces of leather:

and old garments upon them; full of holes and rents, ragged and patched:

and the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy; having been kept a
long time, and unfit for use; or like cakes over baked and burnt, as the
Targum and Jarchi: the word for "mouldy" signifies pricked, pointed,
spotted, as mouldy bread has in it spots of different colours, as white,
red, green, and black, as Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it; or it
signifies bread so dry, as Ben Gersom notes, that it crumbles into
pieces easily, with which the Vulgate Latin version agrees; or rather
through being long kept, it was become dry and hard like crusts, so
Noldius (i); or very hard, like bread twice baked, as Castell (k).

[Joshua 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 9:6</span></span>

And they went to Joshua, unto the camp at Gilgal,.... From whence it
appears, that after Jericho and Ai were destroyed, the army of Israel
returned to their encampment at Gilgal, [Jos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#010.md); and here they were when the
Gibeonites applied to them:

and said unto him, and to the men of Israel; not to the whole body of
the people, but either to the seventy elders, the great council, who
were with Joshua, or the princes of the congregation, after mentioned,
who are said to swear to them; and so some render the words, "to the
chief men of Israel" (l); the word "Ish" here used sometimes denotes an
eminent person or persons, see [Isa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md),

we be come from a far country; this lie they told, that they might not
be thought to be inhabitants of Canaan, and be destroyed as those of
Jericho and Ai were; and as the rest of the inhabitants would be, of
which they had intelligence, as the design of the Israelites, and what
their orders were; according to Jerom (m), Gibeon was but four miles
from Bethel, unless he means Gibeah; however, it could not be at a much
greater distance; and as Gilgal was a mile and a quarter from Jericho,
where the Gibeonites now were, and Ai but three miles from Jericho, and
Bethel a mile from thence, and Gibeon four miles from Bethel, they were
come but little more than nine miles. Bunting (n) makes it twelve miles
from Gilgal to Gibeon:

now therefore make yea league with us; offensive and defensive, to help
and assist each other against a common enemy.

[Joshua 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 9:7</span></span>

And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites,.... Though they did not
know them to be such, but as they afterwards appeared to be the Hivites,
as the Gibeonites were, they are here so called, see [Jos
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#019.md). The name signifies "serpents";
according to a Derash, or mystical exposition, mentioned by Kimchi, the
Gibeonites are so called, because they did the work of the serpent; that
is to say, they deceived the Israelites, as the serpent deceived Eve:

peradventure ye dwell among us; of which they had some suspicion:

and how shall we make a league with you? which they were forbid to do
with any of the seven nations, [Deu
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002.md).

[Joshua 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 9:8</span></span>

And they said unto Joshua, we are thy servants,.... Not that they meant
to be subjects of his, and tributaries to him; but this they said in
great humility and lowliness of mind, being willing to be or do anything
he should enjoin them. Abarbinel observes, that this they proposed to
Joshua singly, not to be servants to all the people, but to him only,
and to have him for their head and governor:

and Joshua, said, who are ye? and from whence come ye? by what name are
ye called? and from what country do ye come? suspecting, as it should
seem, that they were the inhabitants of Canaan; or however he was
cautious and upon his guard, lest they should be such, and yet was not
enough upon his guard to prevent imposition.

[Joshua 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 9:9</span></span>

And they said unto him, from a very far country thy servants are
come,.... Which they magnified and expressed in stronger terms than
before, but were careful not to mention any country, lest such questions
should be asked about it, their answers to which would betray them, but
put it off by saying they were come:

because of the name of the Lord thy God; because of what they had heard
of his name, his power and goodness; or "unto the name of the Lord thy
God" (o); that is, they were come to profess it, and to embrace the
religion of the Israelites, and be proselytes to it; which they knew
would be very agreeable to them, and engage them to show them favour;
and so the Samaritan Chronicle (p) represents them as promising to do
this, saying,"we will believe in thy Lord, nor will we contradict him in
what ye shall mark out for us, be it small or great;''which seems to be,
confirmed by what follows, unless it be considered as an explanation of
the preceding clause:

for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt; the
miracles wrought there, the plagues he inflicted on the Egyptians, and
the wonderful deliverance of the children of Israel from their slavery.

[Joshua 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 9:10</span></span>

And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond
Jordan,.... On the other side of Jordan from Gilgal:

to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan in Ashtaroth; the
history of which see in [Num 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021.md);
they wisely took no notice of the miracle of dividing the waters of
Jordan, to make a passage for the Israelites; nor of the destruction of
Jericho and Ai, which were recent things, and could not be thought as
yet to have reached a far country they pretended to come from; and
which, if they mentioned, might have created a stronger suspicion still
of their being Canaanites.

[Joshua 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 9:11</span></span>

Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our country,

spake unto us,.... They suggest, that their senate, or the states of
their country, their principal men were convened, and that it was the
unanimous voice of them, and of the people, that they should go on this
embassy:

saying, take victuals with you for the journey; sufficient for so long a
journey; for, in those times and countries, inns on the road were not
frequent as now:

and go to meet them; to prevent their coming in an hostile manner unto
them, and make peace, and enter into an alliance with them:

and say unto them, we are your servants; ready to come into any terms
with them, just and reasonable:

therefore now make ye a league with us; that we may live in friendship,
and mutually assist each other, as occasion should require.

[Joshua 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 9:12</span></span>

This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses,....
These are not the words of the elders to the messengers they sent,
continued, but of the ambassadors to the Israelites, pointing to the
bread they brought with them, which they pretended was newly baked and
took hot out of the oven:

on the day we came forth to go unto you, but now, behold, it is dry,

and it is mouldy: See Gill on [Jos
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#005.md); which they gave as a
demonstration and proof that they were come from a far country, as they
had asserted.

[Joshua 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 9:13</span></span>

And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new,.... That is, on
the day they came out on their journey:

and, behold, they be rent; which were owing to the long use that had
been made of them, as they pretended:

and these our garments, and our shoes, are become old by reason of the
very long journey: quite worn out through length of time and tedious
travels. Isidore of Pelusium (q) thinks these Gibeonites were
Cappadocians, of whom he gives a shocking character, and particularly
that they were prone to lying and deceit; but his reason for it, that
they were of the Philistines, will not hold good.

\(q\) L. 1. Ep. 281.

[Joshua 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 9:14</span></span>

And the men took of their victuals,.... That is, the princes of Israel
took thereof; not to eat of them, for it cannot be thought that such
personages would eat of such dry and mouldy bread, and especially as
they were now in a plentiful country, and possessed of the fruits of it;
but to see whether it was in such a plight and condition as they said,
whereby they might judge of the truth of what they said; and they
learned and knew, as R. Jonah observes, from the dryness of their food,
that it was truth they said; and so the Targum, the men hearkened to
their words; and so Jarchi, they believed what they said on sight of
their provisions; but, according to Kimchi and Ben Melech, they ate with
them, to confirm the covenant they made with them; but had this been the
case, as it sometimes was a custom to eat together at making covenants,
see [Gen 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#030.md); the princes would
doubtless have provided a better entertainment for such a purpose: the
"margin" of our Bibles leads to the other sense,"they received the men
by reason of their victuals:"

and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord; as they might and should
have done, by desiring the high priest to inquire of the Lord by Urim
and Thummim; but this they neglected, which, had they attended to, the
fraud would have been discovered; or however, they would have had the
mind of God about making peace with the Gibeonites, which in all
likelihood he would not have disapproved of, they becoming proselytes,
and giving up their possessions to Israel; but this did not excuse their
neglect.

[Joshua 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 9:15</span></span>

And Joshua made peace with them,.... Upon the report the princes made of
having examined what they had said, and which they found to be true,
particularly concerning their victuals:

and made a league with them, to let them live; and not destroy them as
he did the Canaanites, and was ordered to do; they being supposed not to
belong to them by the representation of things they had made:

and the princes of the congregation sware unto them; that they would
keep the league and covenant they had made with them inviolable; they
ratified it by an oath, which was a sacred solemn thing.

[Joshua 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 9:16</span></span>

And it came to pass at the end of three days, after they had made a
league with them,.... The league seems to have been made the same day
they came; the Gibeonites were no doubt in haste to have it concluded,
lest they should be discovered; and Joshua, and the princes of Israel,
took no pains, and gave themselves no great trouble to inquire about
them, but made peace with them at once; and it was but three days after,
or within three days of its being made:

that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt
among them; that is, in their neighbourhood, as the Arabic version; and
so Noldius (r) renders the words, "and that they dwelt near them"; for
the Gibeonites did not dwell among the Israelites, or in the midst of
them, but near the place where they were; and this they understood
either by some deserters that came to the camp of Israel, or by some of
the Israelites who were sent to reconnoitre several parts of the
country, especially such as lay nearest, or for the sake of getting
provisions for their camp.

[Joshua 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 9:17</span></span>

And the children of Israel journeyed,.... Not the whole camp, for that
still remained at Gilgal, and continued there until the Gibeonites in
distress sent to them for assistance in virtue of the league, as appears
from the following chapter; but a party of them, who were sent along
with some of the princes, to know the truth whether the Gibeonites were
their neighbours or not, as had been reported to them:

and came unto their cities on the third day; not on the third day from
their setting out on their journey, for it was but one night's march
from Gilgal to them, [Jos 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#009.md); but on
the third day from the making of the league; it is very probable it was
early on the third day they heard of their being their neighbours, upon
which a party was sent out at once to know the truth of it, who arrived
thither the same day:

now their cities were Gibeon and Chephirah, and Beeroth and
Kirjathjearim; Gibeon was the metropolis, and the other three were
subject to it; the three first fell to the lot of Benjamin, and the last
to the tribe of Judah; we shall meet with them again in the lots of the
several tribes, in [Jos 15:60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#060.md).

[Joshua 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 9:18</span></span>

And the children of Israel smote them not,.... The inhabitants of the
four cities, when they came to them, though they found it to be a true
report that was brought them of their being neighbours, and that they
were imposed upon by them:

because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord
God of Israel; by the Word of the Lord God of Israel, as the Targum, and
therefore they restrained the people from smiting and plundering them;
for it was not the oath of the princes the people so much regarded, or
had such an influence on them as to abstain from seizing on them, but
the princes, by reason of their oath, would not suffer them to touch
them:

and all the congregation murmured against the princes; not only for
taking such an oath, but chiefly because they restrained them from
smiting the Gibeonites, and taking their substance for a prey; their
eager desire of revenge, and of seizing their goods, and inhabiting
their cities, raised a murmur in them against the princes. This is to be
understood not of the whole body of the people at Gilgal, but of all
that party that was sent to Gibeon, and of the princes that went with
them.

[Joshua 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 9:19</span></span>

But all the princes said to all the congregation,.... That is, all the
princes that went to Gibeon addressed all the Israelites that were
there:

we have sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel; by the Word of the
Lord God, as the Targum; an oath is a solemn sacred thing, and not to be
broken, and a good man will make conscience of it, and keep it, though
he has sworn to his own hurt: and

now therefore we may not touch them; neither take away their lives nor
their substance.

[Joshua 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 9:20</span></span>

This we will do to them,.... Either this favour we will show them,
preserving their lives, next mentioned, or this punishment we will
inflict on them, making them hewers of wood, and drawers of water; which
though not mentioned directly, was what was upon their minds, and in
their design to propose, only they were extremely desirous of sparing
their lives, which they repeat:

we will even let them live; this by all means must be done, their lives
must not be taken away as the rest of the Canaanites:

lest wrath come upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them;
that is, lest the wrath of God come upon us princes, and upon the whole
community, for perjury, a breach of the third command, [Exo
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007.md), a sin highly displeasing to God;
since an oath is made not only in his presence, and before him as a
witness, who is appealed unto, but in his name, and is often severely
threatened, and sorely punished; and as even the breach of this oath was
several hundreds of years after, in the times of David, [Sa2
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001.md). The Vulgate Latin version
therefore reads the words, "lest the wrath of the Lord come upon us":
but Abarbinel observes, that it may be understood of the wrath of
Israel; for the words may be rendered, "and there shall not be wrath
upon us, because of the oath": there need be none, there is no occasion
for it, since this was agreed upon on all hands, that the Gibeonites
should be let to live; and since it was an act of kindness and goodness,
and especially they would have no reason to be angry and wrathful with
them, when they heard them out, what they had further to propose to
them, to make them their servants, though they spared their lives.

[Joshua 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 9:21</span></span>

And the princes said to them, let them live,.... They were very pressing
upon them, and importunate with them, to save their lives, because of
the oath they had taken:

(but let them be hewers of wood, and drawers of water, unto all the
congregation): which was a very low and mean employment, [Deu
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#011.md); as well as wearisome; and this
being a yoke of servitude on the Gibeonites, and a punishment of them
for their fraud, and of service, profit, and advantage to the people of
Israel, the princess proposed it in hopes of pacifying them, and that
they would yield to spare the lives of the Gibeonites; what they
proposed was, not that they should hew wood and draw water for all the
Israelites for their private use, but what was necessary for the service
of the sanctuary, which the congregation was obliged to furnish them
with; and now these men should do that work for them, which before was
incumbent on them; for Joshua afterwards imposed this upon them, to be
hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of God, [Jos
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023.md); though Kimchi thinks that while
the people of Israel were in camp, and before the land was divided, they
were hewers of wood and drawers of water to the congregation; but after
the land was divided, and they were settled in their cities and
inheritances, then they only hewed wood and drew water for the sanctuary
at Gilgal, Shiloh, Nob, Gibeon, and the temple; the Jewish writers say
(s), the Nethinim and the Gibeonites were the same, who became
proselytes in the times of Joshua, see [Ch1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md),

as the princes promised them; which is to be connected, not with their
being hewers of wood and drawers of water, this the princes had said
nothing of before, and which is rightly included in a parenthesis, but
with their being let to live; this they had promised and sworn to, even
all the princes, not only all that were now at Gibeon, and were
persuading the people to let the Gibeonites live, but all the princes,

And Joshua called for them,.... The Gibeonites, who came as ambassadors
for their people, who were detained at Gilgal until the children of
Israel returned from Gibeon; and upon their return, and having made
their report to Joshua that they found it to be true that they were near
neighbours, Joshua ordered them to be brought before him:

and he spake unto them, saying, wherefore have ye beguiled us? what is
your reason and motive for so doing? what has induced you to act such a
deceitful part, to tell such lies and falsehoods, and impose upon us
after this manner?

saying, we are very far from you, when ye dwell among us: pretending to
come from a very far country, when they were inhabitants of the land
Israel were come to possess.

Now therefore ye are cursed,.... Appear to be the posterity of cursed
Canaan, and, notwithstanding the artifice used, should not be exempted
from the curse denounced on Canaan: "a servant of servants shall he be
unto his brethren", [Gen 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025.md); as
these Gibeonites were; they became the servants of the Levites, who were
servants to the priests; and they seemed to be spared in Providence,
that that part of the curse on Canaan might be fulfilled: "and Canaan
shall be his servant"; the servant of Shem, from whom the Israelites
sprang, [Gen 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025.md); though the curse
was turned into a blessing to the Gibeonites, since though their post
and office was mean, yet they had a place in the sanctuary of the Lord,
and opportunity of learning the law of God, and understanding the true
religion, worship, and knowledge of God, and were an emblem and pledge
of the reception of the Gentiles into the church of God:

and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen; which the oath
taken did not oblige Joshua, and the princes, to exempt them from, only
to let them live, [Jos 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#015.md),

and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God; which
explains what is meant by the "congregation", and who might purposely
choose that phrase, to make the people more easy; but their work, as
assigned them by Joshua, was not to hew wood and draw water for every
one's private use, only for the service of the sanctuary, which in some
sense was the service of the congregation; and a great deal of work
there was to be done of this kind, much wood to hew for keeping the fire
of the altar continually burning, and for boiling the flesh of the peace
offerings, and the like, and much water to draw for various uses, for
the washing of the priests and the sacrifices, and various other things.

And they answered Joshua, and said, because it was certainly told thy
servants,.... Or "it was told", told (t); not only certainly, told, but
frequently told them, they had often heard of it by one means or
another:

how that the Lord thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all
the land; all the land of Canaan, no part excepted; they had heard much
of the Lord God of Israel, and of Moses, what character he bore, and of
the commands of the Lord to him; they seem to have knowledge of God, and
faith in him as to his promises and threatenings, believing they would
be fulfilled:

and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; as the
gift of the land of Canaan to Israel was often spoken of by the Lord to
Moses, and frequently mentioned by him; so there were instructions given
him from the Lord, and which lie delivered to Israel, utterly to destroy
the inhabitants of Canaan, so, that these people had accurate
intelligence and information of this matter; see [Deu
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md),

therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done
this thing; they answer to Joshua's question, "wherefore have ye
beguiled us?" [Jos 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#022.md), that it was
fear of losing their lives, than which nothing is dearer to a man, and
the principle of self-preservation that put them upon framing and using
this device.

And now, behold, we are in thine hand,.... In thy power, and at thy
disposal, and are ready to submit to whatsoever may be enjoined us:

as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do; do what is
consistent with the laws of kindness, and with the rules of justice, and
particularly with the league made, and oath taken; all which they left
with him to consider of, and to do as in his wisdom and goodness he
should see fit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 9:26</span></span>

And so did he unto them,.... What was good and right, he showed them
favour, and did them justice:

and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they
slew them not; who were so incensed against them for imposing on them in
the manner they did, that they were ready many of them to draw their
swords and slay them; and would have done it, had it not been for the
interposition of Joshua, and the orders he gave to the contrary.

And Joshua made them that day,.... Constituted and appointed them,
ordered and settled them, in the post and office after mentioned; or
"gave" them (u); hence some think they had the name Nethinim, persons
given to the Levites for the service of the sanctuary: namely, to be

hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the
altar of the Lord; some think they were employed both for the service of
the congregation, when they wanted wood and water, and for the altar,
and what belonged to it, that needed both. Abarbinel supposes that they
served the congregation while they were engaged in war, and subduing the
land, but after the division of the land they only served the sanctuary;
See Gill on [Jos 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021.md),

even unto this day in the place which he should choose; to have the
tabernacle pitched, and the altar set up therein, as it was in various
places, before the temple built by Solomon at Jerusalem, which was the
place the Lord chose; and this shows that the writer of this book lived
before the building of the temple, or otherwise it, is highly probable
he would have expressly mentioned it; whereas he uses only the phrase
that Moses frequently expressed it by in his time; see [Deu
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md).
