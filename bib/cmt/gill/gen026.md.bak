INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 26

This chapter treats of Isaac's removal to Gerar, occasioned by a famine,
[Gen 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md); of the Lord's appearance to
him there, advising him to sojourn in that place, and not go down to
Egypt; renewing the covenant he had made with Abraham, concerning giving
that country to him and his seed, [Gen
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#002.md); of what happened unto him at
Gerar on account of his wife, [Gen
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#007.md); of Isaac's great prosperity and
success, which drew the envy of the Philistines upon him, [Gen
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012.md); of his departure from hence to
the valley of Gerar, at the instance of Abimelech; and of the
contentions between his herdsmen, and those of Gerar, about wells of
water, which caused him to remove to Beersheba, [Gen
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#016.md); of the Lord's appearance to him
there, renewing the above promise to him, where he built an altar,
pitched his tent, and his servants dug a well, [Gen
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#024.md); of Abimelech's coming to him
thither, and making a covenant with him, [Gen
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#026.md); which place had its name from
the oath then made, and the well there dug, [Gen
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#032.md); and lastly, of the marriage of
Esau, which was a great grief to Isaac and Rebekah, [Gen
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034.md).

[Genesis 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 26:1</span></span>

And there was a famine in the land,.... In the land of Canaan, as the
Targum of Jonathan expresses it:

besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham; of which see
[Gen 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md); which was an hundred years
before this:

and Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar; where
his father Abraham had sojourned before he was born; and therefore the
present king of this place can scarce be thought to be the same
Abimelech that was king of it in Abraham's time; but it is highly
probable that this Abimelech was the son of the former king, and that
this was a common name to the kings of Gerar or the Philistines, as
Pharaoh was to the kings of Egypt. Isaac came to this place from
Lahairoi, where he had dwelt many years, see [Gen
24:62](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#062.md); which was at or near Beersheba,
and was about eight miles from Gerar (a).

\(a\) Bunting's Travels, p. 70.

[Genesis 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 26:2</span></span>

And the Lord appeared unto him,.... In a vision or dream, when he was at
Gerar:

and said, go not down into Egypt; as his father had done in the like
case, and where Isaac thought to have gone, and the rather, as that was
a fruitful country; and so the Targum of Jonathan,"and it was in the
heart of Isaac to go down into Egypt, and the Lord appeared unto him,
&c.''and charged him not to go thither; partly to try his faith in him,
and dependence on his providence for support in this time of famine, and
partly lest he should think of continuing there, and be unmindful of the
promise of the land of Canaan to Abraham's seed:

dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of; even the land of Canaan,
which he was now about to give him on account of the promise of it to
Abraham and his seed, and to renew it to him and to his seed.

[Genesis 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 26:3</span></span>

Sojourn in this land,.... The land of Canaan, where he now was; either
in Gerar, which though in the land of the Philistines was a part of
Canaan, the place of his present residence; or in any other part of it
he should be directed to: however, by this it appears it was the
pleasure of God that he should not go out of that land, and which
Abraham his father was careful of, that he should not while he lived;
see [Gen 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#006.md),

and I will be with thee, and I will bless thee; with his presence; with
protection from all enemies; with a supply of all the necessaries of
life; and with all spiritual blessings, and with eternal life and
happiness:

for unto thee, and to thy seed, will I give these countries; inhabited
at that time by the Philistines, Canaanites, and the several tribes of
them:

and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
concerning the promise of the Messiah from him and his seed, the gift of
the land of Canaan to them, and the multiplication of them, [Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md).

[Genesis 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 26:4</span></span>

And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,.... Meaning
in the line of Jacob especially, if not only; from whom sprung twelve
patriarchs, the heads of so many tribes, which in process of time became
very numerous, even as the stars of heaven:

and I will give unto thy seed all these countries; which is repeated
from [Gen 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#003.md) for the greater
confirmation of it:

and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; meaning
in the Messiah that should spring from him, see [Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md).

[Genesis 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 26:5</span></span>

Because that Abraham obeyed my voice,.... In all things, and
particularly in offering up his son at his command:

and kept my charge; whatever was given him in charge to observe; this,
as Aben Ezra thinks, is the general, of which the particulars follow:

my commandments, my statutes, and my laws; whether moral, ceremonial, or
civil and judicial; all and everyone which God enjoined him, he was
careful to observe. Here seems to be something wanting, for the words
are not to be joined with the preceding, as if Abraham's obedience was
the cause of the above promises made to Isaac, or to himself: but this
is mentioned rather as an example to Isaac, and to stir him up to do the
like, as if it was said, because or seeing that Abraham thy father did
so and so, do thou likewise.

[Genesis 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 26:6</span></span>

And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. Continued there; in this he was obedient to
the command and will of God.

[Genesis 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 26:7</span></span>

And the men of the place asked him of his wife,.... The inhabitants of
Gerar inquired of Isaac who she was, whether she was his wife or not, or
in what relation she stood in to him; this was not a mere civil inquiry,
but what arose from the prevalence of lust in them towards her; and yet
it was under some restraint, they being not so abandoned to their lusts
as to exercise them upon any; not upon a man's wife, the sin of adultery
being detestable to them, though that of fornication was made no account
of by them:

and he said, she is my sister; herein imitating his father Abraham in
his infirmity and unbelief, who in the same place had made such an
answer to a like question concerning Sarah, [Gen
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001.md); and which if Isaac knew of, as
probably he did, one would wonder that he should fall into the same
evil, and especially when he had not so much to say to support his
assertion as Abraham had; for Rebekah was not so near akin to him as
Sarah was to Abraham; and though cousins might be called sisters, yet
this was mere dissimulation to call his wife sister, and was done with
an intention to deceive, and therefore not justifiable:

for he feared to say, she is my wife; which was the real truth; but the
fear of men, which brings a snare, led him to this, and from which good
men are not always free:

lest, said he, that is, within himself, in his own mind; and so the
Targum of Jonathan, he thought in his heart:

the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; that they might marry
her, one or other of them; for, it seems, they had not so great a sense
of the sin of murder, as of adultery:

because she was fair to look upon; which he feared would be a temptation
to them, and stir up their impure desires after her, in order to gratify
which he was afraid they would kill him; Rebekah retaining her beauty
still, though she had been married in all probability forty years or
more, see [Gen 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#016.md).

[Genesis 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 26:8</span></span>

And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time,.... Perhaps
some years: for though it is in the original, "when days were prolonged
to him there" (b); yet days are sometimes put for years:

that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window; in his
own palace, near to which, in all likelihood, were the apartments that
Isaac and Rebekah dwelt in; and this he did accidentally, and not out of
curiosity, or with any intention to observe or pry into the behaviour
and conduct of these two persons one towards the other:

and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife; laughing
and joking with her, which by his motions and gestures, and the airs and
freedoms he took, Abimelech could perceive were such as were not usual
between brothers and sisters, though honest and lawful between man and
wife; such as embracing her in his arms, and frequently kissing her, and
the like.

\(b\) "cum prolongati essent ei ibi dies", Pagninus, Montanus, Schmidt.

[Genesis 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 26:9</span></span>

And Abimelech called Isaac,.... Sent a messenger to desire him to come
to him:

and said, behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and then perhaps told him
of what he had observed that passed between them; which was a clear
proof that they must be man and wife, or he would never have took such
liberties with her:

and how saidst thou, she is my sister? what reason hadst thou for it?
what could induce thee to say so?

and Isaac said unto him; not alleging, as Abraham did, any relation that
was between them before marriage:

because I said; that is, within himself, for, he did not speak it out to
others:

lest I die for her; for her sake, that another might have and enjoy her;
it was fear of losing his life that led him to take such a step, and
give out that she was his sister.

[Genesis 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 26:10</span></span>

And Abimelech said, what is this thou hast done unto us?.... By
entertaining suspicions and jealousies of us as bad men, and by exposing
us to the temptation of committing iniquity; why hast thou dealt thus
with us, and what have we done, or is in our character, that thou
shouldest act after this manner?

one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife; it is much one
or other had not before this time, not looking upon it criminal to have
to do with a single woman, when they would not have meddled with another
man's wife, Jarchi interprets this of Abimelech himself; and so the
Targum of Jonathan, who perhaps had been thinking of taking her to his
bed; and was "within a little" (c), as the word for "lightly" may be
rendered, of accomplishing his design:

and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us: been the occasion of
their committing the sin of adultery, which was heinous in the eyes of
Heathens, and of bringing on them the punishment due thereunto.

\(c\) "parum abfuit", Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Schmidt.

[Genesis 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 26:11</span></span>

And Abimelech charged all his people,.... All his subjects throughout
his kingdom, and particularly the inhabitants of Gerar, and more
especially his courtiers and servants about him:

saying, he that toucheth this man or his wife; that does any injury to
one either by words or deeds, or behaves immodestly to the other, or
attempts to ravish her; this being sometimes used as a modest expression
carnal knowledge of a woman; or that does either of them any harm or
hurt in any respect whatever:

shall surely be put to death; this severe edict he published, in order
to deter his subjects from using them ill, to which they might be
provoked by Isaac's dissimulation, and by his evil suspicions of them.

[Genesis 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 26:12</span></span>

Then, Isaac sowed in that land,.... In the land of Gerar; after matters
were settled between him and Abimelech, and he had ordered his servants
to do him no hurt, he sowed wheat or barley, or some such grain:

and received in the same year an hundred fold; in which he sowed it, and
which many take to be a year of famine; and so it was the more
extraordinary, that there should be such a plentiful crop produced on
Isaac's ground, when there was such barrenness elsewhere: but it does
not seem likely that it should be the same year of famine in which Isaac
came to Gerar, since he is said to have been them a "long time", [Gen
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#008.md); before this sowing and plenty
upon it were. This increase is far from being incredible; for Pliny (d),
besides instances he gives of an hundred fold, says, that in a field at
Byzacium in Africa one bushel produced one hundred and fifty bushels;
and from the same place, the deputy of Augustus there sent him from one
grain very few less than four hundred, and to Nero three hundred stalks
from, one grain. Herodotus (e) speaks of a country, near to the place
where the Euphrates runs into the Tigris, on which the city Ninus was,
which nowhere failed of producing two hundred fold, and the better sort
of it even three hundred; see [Mat
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#023.md),

and the Lord blessed him; and prospered and succeeded all his
endeavours; and this was the true reason of the fertility of the land he
manured and sowed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 26:13</span></span>

And the man waxed great,.... In substance, as well as in honour and
glory, among men:

and went forward; in the world, and in the increase of worldly things:

and grew until he became very great: as he must needs be, since Abraham
his father left him all that he had, who was very rich in cattle, in
gold and silver, and had been increasing ever since; and especially
since he came to Gerar, where he was gradually increasing, until he
became to be exceeding great indeed, even the greatest man in all the
country, yea, greater than King Abimelech himself, as it seems, from
[Gen 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#016.md).

[Genesis 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 26:14</span></span>

For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds,.... Many
flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, of oxen, asses and camels, in
which the riches of men in those times and countries chiefly lay:

and great store of servants; to look after his flocks and herds, and
fields; or "much husbandry" (f); Jarchi interprets it much tillage; as,
much land, many farms, fields, and vineyards, and the like; to cultivate
which required many servants:

and the Philistines envied him; for his prosperity and success, that his
land should bring forth so plentifully, and that he should have such an
increase of flocks, and herds, and servants, which made him so very
significant great, and honourable.

[Genesis 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 26:15</span></span>

For all the wells which his father's servants had digged, in the days of
Abraham his father,.... For the watering of his flocks and herds, see
[Gen 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#025.md),

the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth; that they
might be of no use; and this they did through envy to him, and is
mentioned as a proof of it.

[Genesis 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 26:16</span></span>

And Abimelech said unto Isaac, go from us,.... Which was either said by
way of advice, consulting Isaac's good, and the peace of his own
kingdom; or else by way of command, enjoining him to depart, having a
secret envy to him himself, or at least was jealous of his growing power
and wealth:

for thou art much mightier than we; in riches or goods, as the Targum of
Jonathan adds; or in number; his family being greatly increased, his
servants numerous, many being born of them in his house; Abraham had
three hundred and eighteen trained servants in his house, [Gen
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014.md); how many Isaac had is not
certain; they must be a large number for Abimelech to fear anything from
them. Some choose to interpret the words, thou hast increased, or thou
hast got much from us, and by us; and therefore it is high time for thee
to be gone from us.

[Genesis 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 26:17</span></span>

And Isaac departed thence,.... At once, peaceably and quietly, though to
his loss and disadvantage, without taking himself either to argument or
arms, in favour of himself; he departed immediately, as soon as he
perceived his abode was disagreeable to the king and his people; which
gives us a very agree, able idea of the calm and peaceable disposition
of Isaac:

and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there; at some
distance from the city of Gerar, as Jarchi observes. Josephus (g) says
it was not far from it; but how far is not certain; very probably it was
not out of the country, though on the borders of it. Some render it,
"the brook of Gerar" (h), and interpret it, that he pitched his tent,
and dwelt by it; and the word used does signify a brook as well as a
valley; and there was a brook of Gerar, which Sozomen (i) makes mention
of.

[Genesis 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 26:18</span></span>

And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the
days of Abraham his father,.... This seems to refer to the same wells
made mention of in [Gen 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#015.md), since
it follows:

for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham; these
were what Abraham's servants had dug, when he lived at Gerar, and which
the Philistines durst not stop during his life; but when he was dead and
particularly out of envy to Isaac his son, whom they observed to prosper
much, they stopped them up, that he might have no benefit by them; for
otherwise they would scarcely have stopped them, if he had not been upon
the spot, but would have made use of them themselves. The opening of
them again by Isaac seems to be done, as Jarchi observes, before he
removed from Gerar to the valley, though it is here related; unless it
can be thought that Abraham dwelt in the valley also, and had dug wells
there, which the Philistines stopped up after his death, and Isaac
opened when he came there; and if so one would think he should have had
no occasion to have dug other new wells, as we find he afterwards did;
besides, this seems to be out of the jurisdiction of the Philistines,
and not in their power to have stopped them here; it seems therefore
most probable that these were Abraham's wells at Gerar, and not in the
valley. Origen (k) makes mention of wonderful wells being dug in the
land of the Philistines by righteous men, meaning Abraham and Isaac; and
particularly in Askelon which, according to some, is the same with
Gerar; See Gill on [Gen 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001.md),

and he called their names after the names by which his father had called
them; which he did out of respect to his father, to preserve the memory
of his name, as well as to make his title and claim to them the more
dear and certain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 26:19</span></span>

And Isaac's servants digged in the valley,.... In the valley of Gerar,
as the Septuagint version expresses it:

and found there a well of springing water; or "living water" (l), which
continually flows, as Aben Ezra rightly interprets it: hence this phrase
is used of the perpetual and ever living graces of the Spirit of God,
[Joh 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 26:20</span></span>

And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,.... About the
well which was dug in the valley; and this shows it was near Gerar or at
least was upon the border of the country, and so it was a disputable
point to whom it belonged:

saying, the water is ours; though the well was dug by Isaac's servants,
yet they laid claim to the water, pretending it was their ground, being
on their borders:

and he called the name of the well Esek: which signifies "contention":
the reason of the name follows:

because they strove with him; wrangled, contended, and disputed with him
about whose right it was.

[Genesis 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 26:21</span></span>

And they digged another well,.... That is, Isaac's servants:

and strove for that also; the herdsmen of Gerar disputed their right to
that also, and strove to get it from them:

and he called the name of it Sitnah; which signifies "hatred", it being
out of hatred and malice to him that they gave him so much trouble; from
this word Satan has his name, and these men were of a diabolical spirit,
envious, spiteful, and malicious.

[Genesis 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 26:22</span></span>

And he removed from thence,.... A little further from their border, to
cut off all pretence, and put a stop to all dispute and controversy for
the future:

and digged another well; in the place he removed to:

and for that they strove not; it being at such a distance from their
border, they could not have the face to claim any right to it:

and he called the name of it Rehoboth; which signifies broad and
spacious, places, enlargements:

for now hath the Lord made room for us; for himself, his family, his
herds, and flocks, and freed them, from those difficulties under which
they laboured, and the straits into which they were brought through the
contention of the herdsmen of Gerar:

and we shall be fruitful in the land; his flocks and his herds increase,
having good pasturage and watering for them, and so he and his family be
in prosperous circumstances.

[Genesis 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 26:23</span></span>

And he went up from thence to Beersheba. From the place he last, removed
unto Beersheba; the famine being over, he returns to the place where he
and his rather formerly lived, [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md).

[Genesis 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 26:24</span></span>

And the Lord appeared to him in the same night,.... The first night he
came to Beersheba, in a dream or vision, in which the Lord was
represented as speaking to him:

and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father; though he was dead, he
remembered the covenant he made with him, and the promises he made unto
him: and besides, though Abraham was dead as to his body, yet alive in
his soul; for God is not the God of the dead, but of the living, [Mat
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032.md),

fear not; any future famine, nor want of any good things, nor any
enemies, the Philistines his neighbours, who had driven him from their
country, and had harassed him from place to place:

for I am with thee, and will bless thee; and if God is with his people,
they have nothing to fear from men; and if he blesses them, they are
blessed, and no curse can light upon them:

and multiply thy seed, for my servant Abraham's sake; who was a
faithful, diligent, servant of his; whose service was, not forgotten by
him, but would be rewarded in a way of grace, though not of debt.

[Genesis 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 26:25</span></span>

And he builded an altar there,.... At Beersheba, where his father
Abraham had planted a grove before, and very probably had built an altar
also, though it might not be now standing, [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md),

and called upon the name of the Lord; and gave him thanks for all his
mercies to him; for the care he had taken of him, and provision he had
made for him and his during the time of famine; and for the protection
and preservation of him in Gerar; and for his deliverance of him out of
the hands of envious, malicious, and unreasonable men; as well as prayed
unto him for present and future mercies, for providential care of him
and his; and for communications of special grace, and for meetness for
eternal glory; all which every good man daily prays to God for:

and pitched his tent there: intending to take up his abode and settle
there:

and there Isaac's servants digged a well; in order to find water for the
family, and for the flocks and herds; and which was necessary to be
done, as they perceived their master designed to fix his habitation
here; wells of water being of great moment and consequence in those hot
and desert countries, as the above contentions about them abundantly
show.

[Genesis 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 26:26</span></span>

Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar,.... After Isaac was settled at
Beersheba, and was still increasing in his family and substance, of
which Abimelech very probably was informed; and fearing lest he should
resent his being sent out of his country by him, and the ill treatment
he met with afterwards from the herdmen of Gerar in the valley about the
wells, and should employ his riches and power against him, and fall upon
him, and take his kingdom from him, he took a journey from Gerar to
Beersheba, to pay Isaac a visit, and make a covenant with him: and

Ahuzzath one of his friends; Jarchi and Jonathan take Ahuzzath for an
appellative, and interpret it of a collection or company of his friends,
which the king took along with him to attend him in his journey: but it
seems rather to be the proper name of a man, who was very intimate and
familiar with the king, and always kept him company, and so went along
with him to Beersheba:

and Phichol the chief captain of his army; his general, as the other was
his principal counsellor or prime minister. There was one of this name,
and in the same office, in the days of Abraham, and who attended the
then present king, who also was called Abimelech on a like account as
here, [Gen 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022.md); but as the one
affair was at the distance of an hundred years or more from the other,
it is probable, that as this Abimelech might be the son of that
Abimelech that lived in the times of Abraham, so this Phichol might be
the son of him that lived then, and who succeeded his father in his
office; though some think that Phichol is the name of an office, and
signifies "the mouth of all", by whom the addresses of the people were
made to the king; but this is not likely, since he is described by his
office as general of the army; which is very different from the master
of the ceremonies, or anything of that kind, and plainly shows it to be
the name of a man.

[Genesis 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 26:27</span></span>

And Isaac said unto them, wherefore come ye to me,.... What is the
meaning of this visit? what has brought you hither? it cannot be from
affection and friendship to me:

seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? the latter he
mentions as a proof of the former; they envied his prosperity, and hated
him on that account, and therefore expelled him their country, or at
least would not suffer him to dwell among them; and still more glaring
proofs were given of the hatred of the men of Gerar to him, not only by
stopping up his father's wells, but by striving and contending with him
about those he dug in the valley after he was gone from them; one of
which he called "Sitnah", from their hatred of him.

[Genesis 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 26:28</span></span>

And they said, we saw certainly that the Lord was with thee,.... Not
only while he was among them, by the fruitfulness of the land he sowed,
by the increase of his family, his flocks and herds, but also since he
was gone from them, in the valley of Gerar, and now in Beersheba:

and we said; one to another, assembled in privy council, in which this
affair was talked over and debated:

let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee: what was
between us and thy father, or between thine ancestors and ours, let it
be renewed and confirmed before us; so Onkelos and Jarchi; see [Gen
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#023.md),

and let us make a covenant with thee; the articles of which follow.

[Genesis 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 26:29</span></span>

That thou wilt do us no hurt,.... Neither to our persons nor properties,
to our kingdom and subjects, by invading our land, and seizing on our
kingdom, all which was feared from Isaac's growing wealth and power:

as we have not touched thee; not done the least injury to him, to his
person, family, and substance, but suffered him to go away with all he
had untouched:

and as we have done unto thee, nothing but good; by royal authority, or
by the command and direction of the king and his nobles; for as for the
stopping up the wells his father's servants had dug, and the controversy
that was about those in the vale, and the trouble Isaac had on that
account, these things were not by the order of the king and council, and
perhaps without their knowledge:

and have sent thee away in peace; no one being suffered to do any injury
to him, or molest him in carrying off everything that belonged unto him:

thou art now blessed of the Lord; so it appeared by the prosperity he
was attended with, and by the Lord's protection of him, and the constant
and continual favours he was bestowing on him; and this induced
Abimelech and his nobles to seek to cultivate friendship, and be on good
terms with him. De Dieu gives a different sense of these words, and
considers them in the form of an oath or imprecation,"if thou shouldest
do us any hurt, seeing we have not touched thee, &c. be thou now
accursed of the Lord,''taking the word used in a contrary sense, as in
[Job 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005.md) [Kg1
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#010.md).

[Genesis 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 26:30</span></span>

And he made them a feast,.... Made a feast like a king, for the king and
his grandees; he treated them in a generous way, according to their
dignity, and agreeable to his own disposition and substance:

and they did eat and drink; freely, cheerfully, and in a friendly
manner; for both having spoken their minds, they agreed to bury all
former things oblivion, and live in peace and friendship; though this
feast was not on account of the covenant made between them, as is
observed by some interpreters, but as an hospitable act, and a token of
good will; for the covenant and the oath confirming it seem to be made
next morning, as follows:

[Genesis 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 26:31</span></span>

And they rose up betimes in the morning,.... Abimelech and his friends,
in order to return home, and Isaac to take his leave of them, and both
to make the covenant between them in form, and confirm it by an oath,
for which the morning was the fitter time; when the mind is quite free
and composed, and attentive to what is done, as so solemn a transaction
should be performed with the utmost attention and seriousness:

and swore one to another; to live in amity and friendship, and not
distress and disturb each other:

and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace; he took
his leave of them in a friendly manner, and they departed well pleased
with the reception they had met with, and the success they had had,
having agreed on and settled articles of peace to mutual satisfaction.

[Genesis 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 26:32</span></span>

And it came to pass the same day,.... That the above things were
transacted:

that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they
had digged; they had dug it before Abimelech came to Isaac, but they had
not had an opportunity of acquainting him with it until he was gone, and
then they came to give him an account of it, what sort of a well it was,
and how it answered their expectations and wishes; and which in those
countries was a very great blessing, and served very much to recommend a
place to dwell in:

and said unto him, we have found water; not only had dug a well, but
they had found plenty of water, and that which was good; or otherwise it
would not have been worth while to have troubled Isaac with the account
of it.

[Genesis 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 26:33</span></span>

And he called it Sheba,.... Which, according to Jerom, signifies
"fulness", as if it had its name from the abundance of water in it; but
rather it signifies an "oath", and was so called from the oath, which he
and Abimelech had just took to one another; and these circumstances
meeting together, the taking of the oath, and the account of the well:

therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day; that is, the
well of the oath: it had been so called by Abraham an hundred years ago
or more; but now upon this occasion it was renewed and confirmed, and so
continued until the times of Moses, and many ages after.

[Genesis 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 26:34</span></span>

And Esau was forty years old,.... The same age his father was of when he
married, [Gen 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020.md),

when he took to wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite; Josephus
(m) makes her to be the same with Aholibamah; but her father's name was
Zibeon, and an Hivite, and must therefore be another person, not only
the name being different, but the tribe, [Gen
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002.md),

and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite; whom Aben Ezra takes to
be the same with Adah, and so does Josephus; and in this they may be
right, since the name of her father, and his nation or tribe, agree,
[Gen 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002.md). The fathers of these two
women are represented by Josephus as men of great power and authority
among the Canaanites, as very probably they were. Esau had another wife
of the same name with this last, but she was daughter of Ishmael, and
sister of Nebajoth, [Gen 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#003.md); for he
had more wives than those; these were his two first, who very probably
were not taken together, but one after another, though it may be but at
a short distance from each other.

\(m\) Antiqu. l. 1. c. 18. sect. 4.

[Genesis 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">gen 26:35</span></span>

Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac, and to Rebekah. The marriage of
them itself was a trouble to them, it being contrary to their will that
any of their children should marry with the Canaanites, and those the
worst sort of them, the Hittites; it having been the care of Abraham,
the father of Isaac, that his son should not marry with them, and laid a
strict injunction on his servant not to take a wife for his son from
among them; and which was an example to be followed in later times, and
which Esau very likely was not ignorant of: and besides this, the women
themselves he took for wives were very disagreeable on all accounts,
partly because of their religion, being idolaters, and partly by reason
of their temper and behaviour, being proud, haughty, and disobedient; as
all the three Targums intimate.
