INTRODUCTION TO HOSEA 13

This chapter begins with observing the different state and condition of
Ephraim before and after his idolatry, [Hos
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md); his increase in it, [Hos
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md); and therefore his prosperity was
very short lived, which is signified by various metaphors, [Hos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003.md); and his sins are aggravated by
the former goodness of God unto him his great ingratitude unto God, and
forgetfulness him, [Hos 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004.md); hence he
is threatened with his wrath and vengeance in a very severe manner, [Hos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007.md); for which he had none to blame
but himself; yea, such was the grace and goodness of God to him, that
though he had destroyed himself, yet there were help and salvation for
him in him, [Hos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md); though not in
his king he had desired, and was given, and was took away in wrath, [Hos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010.md); but his sin being bound up and
hid, and he foolish and unwise, sharp corrections would be given him,
[Hos 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#012.md); and yet a gracious promise
is made of redemption from death and the grave by the Messiah, [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md); but, notwithstanding this, and
all his present prosperity, he would be blasted in his wealth and
riches; and Samaria the metropolis of his country would he desolate; and
the inhabitants of it be used in the most cruel manner, because of their
rebellion against God, [Hos 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015.md).

[Hosea 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 13:1</span></span>

When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel,.... Or, with
trembling, as Jarchi: so Jeroboam, who was of the tribe of Ephraim,
spake before Solomon, a great king, as he observes. R. Moses the priest
interprets it of Jeroboam; but it may be understood of the tribe in
general, and especially of the heads of it, at anytime before it fell
into idolatry; when they spake with submission and humility, they were
attended to by the other tribes in all consultations and debates, and
great deference was paid unto them; and they were find in great esteem,
and highly honoured, agreeably to that common saving of our Lord, "he
that humbleth himself shall be exalted", [Luk
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011.md); or, "when he spake there was
trembling" (q); either the neighbouring nations, when he threatened them
with war: or among the other tribes of Israel, when he spake in counsel,
and with authority, they rose up and heard him with great reverence and
respect; see [Job 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008.md). So the Targum,

"when anyone of the house of Ephraim spake, trembling laid hold on the
people; they became princes in Israel.''

Some refer this to the times of Joshua, who was of that tribe, and whom
the Israelites feared as they had feared Moses, [Jos
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#014.md); others to the times of Gideon
and Jephthah, with whom the tribe of Ephraim expostulated, [Jdg
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md); but others interpret it of
Jeroboam's idolatry, of his setting up the worship of the calves, which
he did upon his exalting himself, and setting himself up as king of the
ten tribes; and, in some agreement with this, Schmidt understands, by
"trembling", a terrible and horrible thing, idolatry, which he commanded
and appointed; and which he "bore" or "carried", as the word (r) is
interpreted by him, and may be; that is, his sin, and the punishment of
it, which Jeroboam and his posterity did bear; and so it agrees with
what follows:

but, or "and",

when he offended in Baal, he died; or when he sinned, and became guilty
of more idolatry still, by worshipping Baal, as well as the calves,
which was done in the times of Ahab, [Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031.md); when Ephraim or the kingdom or
Israel fell into distresses and calamities, sunk in their grandeur and
authority, declined in their wealth and riches, and were insulted by
their enemies, particularly by Benhadad king of Syria, who sent to Ahab,
and challenged his silver and gold, his wives and children, as his own,
[Kg1 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#003.md); and so they gradually
decreased in credit and reputation, in power and authority, in wealth
and substance, and at last were delivered to the sword of the enemy, and
to captivity, which was their civil death.

[Hosea 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 13:2</span></span>

And now they sin more and more,.... Since the times of Jeroboam, and
also of Ahab, adding other deities to the calves, and to Baal, as
follows; increasing the number of their idols, and their idolatrous
sacrifices, rites, and ceremonies: this they did in the times the
prophet, who prophesied after the times of as it is common with evil men
and seducers to wax worse and worse, and to proceed to more ungodliness,
and from evil to evil; such is the way of idolaters, they stop not, but
run into greater absurdities and grosser idolatries:

and have made them molten images of their silver: which is to be
understood, not of the calves, or of Baal, made of gold, which they
purchased with their silver; but of other images they had in their
houses, or carried about with them, made of their silver, of their
plate, which they melted and cast images of it, of whatsoever shape or
form they pleased:

and idols according to their own understanding; which were entirely of
man's device, and had nothing divine in them, either as to matter or
form, but wholly the invention of the human brain; or, "according to
their own likeness", as the Targum, and so other Jewish interpreters;
after the form of a man, and yet were so weak and stupid as to account
them gods:

all of it the work of the craftsmen; of silversmiths and founders, and
such like artificers; the same, or of the same sort, with the craftsmen
that made shrines for Diana, [Act
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024.md); and therefore such a work,
wrought by such hands, could never be a deity, or have anything divine
in it; they must be as stupid and senseless as the work itself to
imagine there should: and yet

they say of them; the false prophets, or the idolatrous priests, say of
such idols:

let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves: let those that bring their
sacrifices, or those that offer them, pay religious worship and
adoration to the calves; which they signified by kissing the idols they
sacrificed to, either their mouths, or their hands; or, if out of their
reach, they kissed their own hands in token of honour to them; which
rites were commonly used among the Heathens. Cicero (s) says at
Agrigentum, where was a temple or Hercules, where the people not only
used to show a veneration to his image by prayers and thanksgivings, but
they used to kiss it. So Apuleius (t) speaks of a beautiful virgin, the
report of whose beauty brought together a vast number of citizens and
strangers; who, amazed at the sight of her, put their right hand to then
mouths, the first finger resting upon the thumb erect, and gave her
reverence with religious adoration, as if she had been the goddess Venus
herself; and Minutius Felix (u) says of Caecilius, that, observing the
image of Serapis (probably much like one of these calves), putting his
hand to his mouth, according to the superstitious custom of the common
people, with his lips smacked a kiss; and so Pliny (w) observes, in
worshipping, the right hand is used for a kiss, turning about the whole
body, which to do to the left was reckoned the more religious; hence it
is observed (x) of Aemilius, a derider of and scoffer at things divine,
that he would never make supplication to any god, nor frequent any
temple; and if he passed by any place of worship, he reckoned it a crime
to put his hand to his lips by way of adoration, or on account of that;
and it seems to have obtained as early as the times of Job among
idolatrous people, that, upon the sight of the sun or moon, they
immediately with their mouth kissed their hands; see [Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026); hence Lucian (y.md), speaking of
the Indians, says, rising early in the morning, they worship the sun,
not as we, who think the prayers are finished when the hand is kissed;
and Tertullian (z), addressing the Heathens in his time, thus bespeaks
them, most of you, out of an affectation of worshipping the celestial
bodies at the rising of the sun, move and quaver your lips; hence
kissing is used for the worship of the Son of God, [Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md). Some read the words, "let those
that sacrifice a man (a) kiss the calves"; as if it respected the
abominable practice of sacrificing men to Mo; or intimated that men were
sacrificed to the calves at Bethel.

[Hosea 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 13:3</span></span>

Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud,.... Which, however
promising it is, soon disappears when the sun is risen; signifying that
the idolatrous Israelites, king, priests, and people, should be no more;
their kingdom would cease, all their riches and wealth would depart from
them, and they and their children be carried captive into a strange
land:

and as the early dew it passeth away; as soon as the heat of the sun is
felt, when the earth is left dry; so these people, though they seemed to
be in great prosperity, and to be very fruitful in children, and in
substance, and promised themselves much more; yet in a little time their
land would become desolate, and they stripped of all that was dear and
valuable to them these metaphors are used in [Hos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md);

as the chaff that is driven with a whirlwind out of the floor;
signifying that these idolatrous people were like chaff, fight and
empty, useless and unprofitable, fit for nothing but burning; and that
they would be driven out of their own land through the Assyrian, that
should come like a whirlwind with great three and power, as easily and
as quickly as chaff is drove out of a threshing floor of corn with a
strong blast of wind; see [Psa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md);

and as the smoke out of the chimney; which rises up in a pillar, and is
so on dissipated by the wind, or dissolved into air; and is no sooner
seen but it disappears; see [Psa 68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002.md).
All these similes show how easily, suddenly, and quickly, the
destruction of this idolatrous nation would be brought about.

[Hosea 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 13:4</span></span>

Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt,.... Which brought thee
out from thence, as the Targum; and ever since, from that time to this,
had shown a regard unto them, as the Lord their God, both in the
wilderness, as later mentioned, and in the land of Canaan, where they
had been continued, and followed with instances of goodness to that day,
and yet find sinned in so gross a manner; which argued great ingratitude
in them, and forgetfulness of the Lord, and his mercies:

and thou shalt know no God but me; they ought to have known,
acknowledged, and worshipped no other god, as was enjoined them in the
law: or, "thou knowest not" (b); they did not know any other, which they
in their own consciences were obliged to confess, if appealed to;
however, they should know no other; by sad experience they would find
that there was no other that could be of any service to them; their
images and idols being unable to help them:

for there is no saviour besides me; that could save them out of their
troubles, and deliver them out of their distresses; no other that is, or
can be, the author, either of temporal or of spiritual and eternal
salvation.

[Hosea 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 13:5</span></span>

I did know thee in the wilderness,.... Where there were no food nor
drink, where were scorpions, serpents, and beasts of prey; there the
Lord knew them, owned them, and showed a fatherly affection for them,
and care of them; and fed them with manna and quails, and guided and
directed them in the way, and protected and preserved them from their
enemies, and from all hurt and danger. So the Targum explains it,

"I sufficiently supplied their necessities in the wilderness:''

in the land of great drought; or, "of droughts" (c); the word is only
used in this place; and is by Aben Ezra interpreted a dry and thirsty
land; and so he says it signifies in the Arabic language and the same is
observed by the father of Kimchi, and by R. Jonah (d); but is by some
rendered "torrid" (e), or "inflamed", as if it had the signification of
a Hebrew word which signifies a flame: and the Targum takes it to be
akin to another, which signifies to "desire", rendering it,

"in a land in which thou desirest everything;''

that is, wants everything. The first seems best, and is a fit a
description of the wilderness, which was a place of drought, wherein was
no water, [Deu 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md).

[Hosea 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 13:6</span></span>

According to their pasture, so were they filled,.... When they came into
the land of Canaan, which was a land flowing with milk and honey, they
were like a flock of sheep brought from short commons to a good pasture;
and there they tilled themselves to the fail, and indulged to luxury and
excess, pampered themselves, and made provision for the flesh to fulfil
its lusts, and became carnal and sensual:

they were filled, and their hearts were exalted: they were elated with
their plenty, and grew proud and haughty, and attributed their fulness
not to the goodness of God, but to their own excellency and merit; and
put their trust and confidence in their affluence, and not in the Lord;
and thought themselves safe and secure, and out of all danger, and
concluded it would never be otherwise with them:

therefore have they forgotten me; the Author of their beings, the Father
of their mercies, and God of all their comforts; they forgot to give him
praise and glory for their abundance; to place their trust and have
their dependence on him, and to serve and worship him; this was the
consequence of their luxury and pride. The Targum is,

"therefore they left my worship;''

they waxed fat, and kicked, and lightly esteemed and forsook the God and
Rock of their salvation, [Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md).

[Hosea 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 13:7</span></span>

Therefore I will be unto them as a lion, Because of their idolatry,
ingratitude, luxury, and especially their forgetfulness of God, which is
last mentioned, and with which the words are connected. By this and the
following metaphors are set forth the severity of God's judgments upon
them for their sins, and their utter destruction by them. Some observe
the word (f) here used signifies an old lion, which, though slower in
the pursuit of its prey, is more cruel when it has got it; see [Hos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014.md);

as a leopard by the way will I observe them; which is a quick sighted,
vigilant, crafty, and insidious creature, which lurks in trees, and
watches for men and beasts that pass by the way, and seizes on them. The
lion makes his onset more openly, this more secretly; and both express
the various ways God would take in his providence to chastise these
people for their sins, and that he would watch over them to do them
hurt, as he had to do them good, and take the proper opportunity of
doing it, and execute his purpose with great wrath and fury, to their
utter ruin; see [Jer 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md). The
Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, render it, "as a
leopard by the way of Assyria" (g), or "the Assyrians"; and so some
interpreters take the sense to be, that God would watch them in their
way to Assyria for help, and blast their designs, disappoint them of
their expected assistance, and surprise them with his judgments; see
[Hos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md); and there was a mountain in
Syria, called the mountain of the leopards, where they used to haunt,
and from whence they came out to take their prey, to which there is a
reference in [Sol 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008.md); which was two
miles from Tripoli (a city of Syria) northward, three from the city
Arces southward, and one from Mount Lebanon (h); and such is the
vigilance and agility of leopards, that they will sometimes, as Pliny
(i) says, mount thick trees, and hide themselves in the branches, and
leap at once, and unawares, upon those that pass by, whether men or
beasts, as before observed; wherefore, with great propriety, is this
simile used. The Targum is, "my word shall be", &c.

[Hosea 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 13:8</span></span>

I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps,.... Which is
a fierce cruel creature at any time, but especially when this is its
case, being very fond of its whelps; and having taken a great deal of
pains to lick them into form, as Kimchi and Ben Melech observe, it is
the more enraged at the loss of them, and therefore falls upon man or
beast it meets with the utmost fury: the phrase is expressive of the
fiercest rage; see [Pro 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#012.md);

and will rend the caul of their hearts: the pericardium, which is a
membrane or skin that encloses the heart, and which when pierced is
immediate death: perhaps some respect is had to the closing of their
hearts to God, the hardness of them against him and his ways, and their
inattention to his word; and now he will open them, not in a way of
grace and mercy, but of wrath and fury; as a bear, when it seizes a man,
sticks his claws in his breast, tears it open, and makes his way at once
to the heart, fetches it out, and sucks his blood:

and there will I devour them like a lion; either in their cities and
houses, when taken by the enemy; or in the way, in which they would be
observed; or in their captivity: or there may be put for then, and so
denotes the time when he would be all this to them before mentioned, and
then he would utterly destroy them:

the wild beast shall tear them: which literally is one of God's sore
judgments, but here figuratively designs the Assyrian, and who is meant
as the instrument of God's vengeance in all the other expressions; and
is sometimes compared to a lion, and that as concerned with Israel; see
[Jer 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md); which is much better than
by these four sorts of creatures to understand the four monarchies which
Israel suffered by. The Targum is,

"my word shall meet them as a bear bereaved, and I will break the
wickedness of their hearts, &c.''

[Hosea 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 13:9</span></span>

O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself,.... Though the Lord was a lion, a
leopard, and a bear to them, yet their destruction was not owing to him,
but to themselves; he was not chargeable with it, but they only; the
fault and blame was theirs; their own sins brought it on them, and
provoked him to such righteous wrath and vengeance before expressed:
this is said to clear the Lord from any imputation of this kind, and to
lay it where it should be It may be rendered, "it hath destroyed thee"
(k); either the calf, as Kimchi, and the worshipping of that, their
idolatry; or their king, as others, taking it from the following verse
by way of anticipation; or rather it may refer to all their sins before
observed, their idolatry, luxury, and ingratitude. Gussetius (l) thinks
the word has the signification of "burning", as in [Isa
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md); and renders it, "burning in me
hath destroyed thee, even in him who is thy help"; that is, by their
sins they had made God their enemy, who is a consuming fire, and whose
burning wrath destroyed them, in whom otherwise they would have had
help. Now though this may primarily regard the destruction of the civil
state and kingdom of Israel for their sins, yet it may be applied to the
spiritual and eternal state of men. Man is a lost, ruined, and undone
creature; he is depraved and corrupted in his whole nature, soul and
body; the image of God in him is marred and spoiled; there is no
holiness in him, nor any righteousness upon him; no will nor power to
that which is good; though he has not lost the natural liberty of his
will, he has lost the moral liberty of it, and is a slave to his lusts,
and a vassal to Satan; he has no true knowledge of that which is good,
no inclination to it, nor strength to perform it he is dead in sin, and
dead in law; he is under the curse of it, and in the open way to
everlasting ruin and destruction; and is in himself both helpless and
lifeless; and he is a self-destroyed creature; his destruction is not
owing to Satan only, though he was an instrument of the ruin of mankind;
nor to the first parents of human nature only, in whom all men naturally
and federally were, in whom they sinned, and with whom they fell; but to
their own actual sins and transgressions. However, their destruction is
not to be charged upon God, or ascribed to any decree of his, which is
no cause of man's damnation, but sin only; nor to any sentence of
condemnation passed by him, or the execution of it, which both belong to
him as a righteous Judge; but to themselves and their sins, as is owned
both by good men, who under true and saving convictions acknowledge
their damnation would be just, if God should execute it on them; and by
bad men, even the damned in hell; this will be the never dying worm, the
remorse of a guilty conscience, that they have brought all this ruin on
themselves;

but in me is thine help; not in themselves, not in any creature, but in
the Lord alone; the Word of the Lord, as the Targum; the essential Word,
the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, on whom his divine Father has
laid the help of his people; and who has helped them, and saved them
from their sins, the cause of their destruction, and from wrath, which
they deserved by reason of them; and has brought them out of a wretched
state, a pit wherein is no water, into a comfortable, glorious, and
happy one, and delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies; and
helps them to what they want, to holiness, righteousness, and strength;
to all supplies of grace here, and glory hereafter. Some render the
particle as causal, "for in me", &c. (m) and so make it to be a reason
either proving that God could not be the cause of their destruction,
because in him was their help, and in him only; or that their
destruction was owing to themselves; "for in" or "against me, against
thine help"; thou hast transgressed and rebelled; so Jarchi.

[Hosea 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 13:10</span></span>

I will be thy King, where is any other that may save thee in all thy
cities?.... Governor, Protector, and Defender; and so confirming what is
before said, that their help was in him: or, as the Targum, Abarbinel,
and others (n), "where is thy king now, that he may serve thee in all
thy cities?" whom they had asked, rejecting the Lord, and in whom they
had put their trust and confidence for help; and now either having no
king, he being taken away from them by death, or by the enemy; or if
they had, he being unable to help them in their distress; they are
ironically asked where he was, that he might exert himself and save
them, if he could, in all the cities of the land, where the enemy were
come, a, a had besieged and took them:

and thy judges, of whom thou saidst give me a king and princes? that is;
where are thy king and his nobles, his courtiers and his counsellors,
and all judges, magistrates, and governors subordinate to him? let them
arise for thy help, if they can, by their policy or power, by their
counsel, or by their arms; for judges and princes design such as were of
the king's court and council, or acted in government under his direction
and influence; for though these are not expressly mentioned, when they
asked for a king, yet are implied; since there is no king without a
court and nobles to attend him, to advise with, and to act under him.
This refers to the story in [Sa1 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#006.md),
&c. and seems to be the leading step to Israel's ruin and destruction as
a state.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 13:11</span></span>

I gave thee a king in mine anger,.... Not the king of Assyria, sent to
waste and destroy them, and carry them captive, as some, for of him the
next clause cannot be said; nor Jeroboam, the first king of the ten
tribes, as others, who was not given in anger to Israel, but to Solomon;
rather Saul, as Kimchi and Aben Ezra, the first king of all Israel; and
who was given at the request of the people, though in anger and
resentment, they rejecting God their King; or it may design the kingly
office and power in general, in a succession of kings from him the first
of them:

and took him away in my wrath; not Jeroboam, who does not appear to be
taken away by death in wrath; rather Saul, who died in battle with the
Philistines, and fell on the mountains of Gilboa: but it may be rendered
better, "I will take him away" (o); and refers not to Zedekiah the last
king of Judith, as some in Kimchi; but to Hoshea, the last king of the
ten tribes; for it is of there more especially the words, both in the
text and context, are spoken; and so it respects the entire removal of
kingly power from them, which ceased in Hoshea; see [Hos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md).

[Hosea 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 13:12</span></span>

The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid. Which Kimchi
restrains to the sin of the calves, and worshipping them; and others to
the request of a king, the context speaks of: but it seems best to
understand it in a more general sense of these, with all other sins,
which were bound up, and not loosed, or were not remitted and forgiven,
they being impenitent, and persisting in their sins; and which were
bound up as in a bag or purse, in order to be opened and brought forth
in proper time in open court, and be took cognizance of in a judiciary
way; with which agrees an expression in [Job
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017.md); or which were laid up among the
treasures of divine omniscience, in the mind of God, and not forgotten
by him, as they might be thought to be, and would in due time be brought
to light, and vengeance took on them. So the Targum,

"the sins of the house of Ephraim are treasured up; they are reserved to
punish all their offences;''

see [Deu 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034.md).

[Hosea 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 13:13</span></span>

The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him,.... Upon Ephraim,
or the ten tribes; that is, afflictions, distresses, and calamities,
which are often in Scripture compared to the pains and sorrows of a
woman in childbirth; and may denote the suddenness and inevitableness of
them; see [Isa 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008.md). So the Targum,

"distress and trouble shall come upon them, as pains on a woman with
child;''

which may respect the invasion of their land, the siege of Samaria, and
their captivity;

he is an unwise son; taking no warning by his ancestors, by their sins,
and what befell them on account of them, but persisting in his sins, and
in impenitence and hardness of heart: so the Targum,

"he is not wise to know my fear:''

for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of
children: that is, in the womb, as Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it;
though the Targum and Jarchi understand it of the stool or seat of women
in travail. The sense is, either that he is foolish and unwise, that he
does not endeavour to extricate himself from these troubles; or rather
to prevent them by repentance, by leaving his idols, and returning to
the Lord; or that, should he do so, be would soon be delivered from all
his sorrows, and not stay a moment longer in them. Though the words may
be better rendered, "for he stays not", or "would not stay, the time for
the breaking forth of children" (p); now this time is the time of the
Gospel dispensation, the time of the Messiah's birth, the fulness of
time appointed for his coming, and the time of the church's ringing
forth many children in a spiritual sense; see [Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md); for which Ephraim or the ten
tribes should have waited, but did not, which was their folly and their
ruin; they did not "stand", or continue, in the belief and expectation
of the Messiah, and in the true worship of God, but left that, and
served idols; and so continued not to the times of the Messiah, when the
blessings mentioned in the following verse would be obtained and
enjoyed; so Schmidt.

[Hosea 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 13:14</span></span>

I will ransom them from the power of the grave,.... That is, "when" or
"at which time" before spoken of, and here understood, as the above
interpreter rightly connects the words, "I will" do this and what
follows:

I will redeem them from death; these are the words, not of Jehovah the
Father, as in [Hos 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007.md); but of the
Son, who redeemed Israel out of Egypt, which was a typical redemption,
[Hos 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004.md); in whom is the help of his
people laid and found, [Hos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md); the
Word of the Lord, as the Targum; who is the true God, the mighty God,
and so equal to this work of redemption and who is also the near kinsman
of the redeemed as one of the words here used implies, and so to him
belonged the right of redemption: the persons redeemed are not Israel
after the flesh, but spiritual Israel, whether Jews or Gentiles; a
special and peculiar people, chosen of God, and precious, out of every
kindred, tongue, people, and nation; and who, in their nature state, are
under sin, in bondage to it, and liable to the curse of the law, the
wrath of God, hell and damnation; which are meant by the "grave" and
"death", and so needed a Redeemer to ransom them: for the word for
"grace" should be rendered "hell" (q), as it often is; and "death"
intends not corporeal one only, but eternal death, or the second death;
and both signify the wrath of God due to sin, and which God's elect are
deserving of, and Christ has bore, and delivered them from; and the
curse of the law, which he has redeemed them from, being made a curse
for them; and eternal death, the equivalent to which he has suffered,
and so has saved them from it, and all this by redeeming them from their
sins, the cause of it; and which he has done by giving a redemption or
ransom price, which is his blood, his life, yea, himself, and which the
first of the words here used imports. It is indeed true, that, in
consequence of all this, there will be a redemption by him from a
corporeal death, and from the grave; not as yet, for the ransomed of the
Lord die as others, and are laid in the grave, the house appointed for
all living; but in the resurrection morn there will be a redemption, a
deliverance of the bodies of the saints from the grave, from mortality
and corruption; yea, of them from the moral corruption of sin, and all
the defilements of it, as well as from all afflictions and diseases, and
from death itself, which shall have no more dominion over them; to which
purpose the words are applied by the apostle; See Gill on [Co1
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055); and so by some ancient Jews (r.md)
to the Messiah, and his times;

O death, I will be thy plagues; O grace, I will be thy destruction; that
is, the utter destruction of them for the plague or pestilence is a
wasting destruction, [Psa 91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md); it is
the same which in New Testament language is the abolishing of death,
[Ti2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md); which is true of eternal
death with respect to the redeemed, which Christ's death is the death
of, he having by his death reconciled them to God, and opened the way to
eternal life for them, which he has in his hands to give unto them; and
of corporeal death and the grave, which Christ has utterly destroyed
with respect to himself having loosed the builds of death, and set
himself free, and on whom that shall have no more dominion; and, with
respect to his pie, he has destroyed him that had the power of it, which
is the devil; he has put away and abolished sin, the cause of it; he has
took away that which is its sting; so that it may be truly said, as the
apostle quotes these words, "O death, where is thy sting?" he has
removed the curse from it, and made it a blessing; he has abolished it
as a penal evil, so theft it is not inflicted as a punishment on his
people; and in the last day will entirely deliver them from the power of
that, and of the grave; and then that which has slain its millions and
millions, a number not to be numbered, will never slay one more: and
that grave, which devoured as many, will never be opened more, or one
more put into it; and then it may be said, "O grave, where is thy
victory?" thou shall conquer no more, but be at an end; see [Co1
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055.md);

repentance shall be hid from mine eyes; that is, the Lord will never
repent of his decree of redemption from hell, death, and the grave; nor
of the work of it by Christ; nor of the entire destruction of these
things; which being once done, will never be repented of nor recalled,
but remain so for ever.

[Hosea 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 13:15</span></span>

Though he be fruitful among his brethren,.... This is not spoken of
Christ, as some think, who take the words to be a continuation of the
prophecy concerning the Redeemer, who should increase his brethren, and
bring many to him; and be as noxious to hell and death as the east wind
is to persons and things, and dry up the fountains and springs of hell
and death; the sins of men he should abolish, and be victorious over all
his enemies, and divide their spoils: but they are rather the words of
Christ himself concerning Ephraim, in connection with [Hos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md); expressing his character and
state, and explaining the sorrows and calamities that should come upon
him for his folly, in not staying the time of the breaking forth
children; and to be understood either of his spiritual fruitfulness in
the last days; when Israel shall return to the Lord by repentance, and
believe in the true Messiah, and bring forth the fruit of good works, as
an evidence of it, along with their brethren, those of the tribes of
Judah and Benjamin, and so all Israel should be saved; which yet should
not hinder the distresses and destruction that should come upon the ten
tribes by the Assyrians, afterwards declared: or rather of his political
fruitfulness, in allusion to his name; increasing in numbers, abounding
in power and authority, in wealth and riches; either before the sin of
the calves, as Kimchi, before he fell into idolatry; or afterwards,
particularly in the times of Jeroboam the second, who enlarged the
border of Israel; and in later times, when the kings of Israel entered
into alliance with the Assyrians, and enjoyed peace and prosperity, and
thought themselves secure of the continuance of it. Some render it,
"because he is fierce" (s); or "like a wild ass's colt"; not only
foolish and unwise, but fierce and unruly among his brethren, and would
not stay the time of the breaking forth of children: therefore

an east wind shall come: which is very vehement, cold, blasting, and
exceeding noxious and pernicious to fruit; meaning Shalmaneser king of
Assyria, who came from the east; his kingdom, the land of Assyria,
lying, as Kimchi observes, eastward to the land of Israel. So the
Targum,

"now will I bring against him a king strong as a burning wind;''

so the king of Babylon and his army are compared to a strong and violent
wind, [Jer 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md);

the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness; the same is
called the "wind of the Lord", partly to denote the strength and
vehemency of it, as mountains of the Lord, and cedars of the Lord,
signify great and mighty ones; and partly to show that this enemy would
come at the call of the Lord, by his direction and appointment. So the
Targum,

"by the word of the Lord, through the way of the wilderness shall he
come up;''

this circumstance, "from the wilderness", is mentioned, not only because
winds from thence usually blow more strongly and violently, but because
the way from Assyria to the land of Israel lay through a wilderness;

and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up; his
land wasted and destroyed; his fields, vineyards, and oliveyards,
trodden down and ruined, which yielded a large increase; trade and
commerce stopped, and so all the springs and fountains of wealth and
riches dried up; as well as their wives and children destroyed, as often
mentioned, which were the source and spring of their continuance as a
people in ages to come;

he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels; not Christ, nor
Ephraim, but the Assyrian; who, entering into their cities, would
plunder them of all their "vessels of desire" (t), or desirable ones;
their vessels of gold and silver; all their rich household goods and
furniture of value; all their wealth and riches treasured up by them,
their gold, silver, precious stones, rich garments, &c. So the Targum,

"he shall destroy the house of his treasures, and shall lay waste the
city of his kingdom; he shall spoil the treasuries, all vessels of
desire.''

[Hosea 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 13:16</span></span>

Samaria shall become desolate,.... With this verse the fourteenth
chapter begins in the Hebrew copies, and in the Targum, and in many
versions; but seems better to conclude the present chapter; since it is
in close connection with [Hos 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015.md),
and explains the figurative expressions there used. Samaria was the head
of Ephraim, [Isa 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009.md); or the
metropolis of the ten tribes of Israel; whose desolation is here
prophesied of, and was accomplished by Shalmaneser king of Assyria,
signified by the east wind; by whom it was not only besieged and taken,
but very probably its houses were demolished, its walls broken down, and
razed to the very foundation; see [Kg2
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005.md); and, as this was the head city,
it may be put for all the rest, and even for the whole land, which was
at the same time laid waste. The Targum is,

"Samaria shall be guilty;''

that is, shall be found guilty of many sins; her transgression shall be
revealed, as Jarchi, become manifest by the just punishment inflicted on
her;

for she hath rebelled against her God; and bitterly provoked him to
wrath and anger, as the word (u) signifies; by relinquishing him and his
worship, and by serving idols, the calves at Dan and Bethel, Baal and
other idols; when the Lord was their God, not only by creation, as of
all men, but by the choice he made of them, and the covenant he made
with them; by a national adoption of them, attended with various
blessings and privileges, and by their profession of him; all which were
an aggravation of their rebellion against him;

they shall fall by the sword: the inhabitants of Samaria, and of the
land, particularly the men thereof; and especially their armed men,
their men of war, that fought for them, and defended them; these should
fall by the sword of the Assyrian;

their children shall be dashed to pieces; against stones, walls, and
pavements; who should have perpetuated their name to future ages, and
inherited their possessions:

and their women with child shall be ripped up; things which are often
done by cruel enemies, when cities are sacked and plundered; and which
Shalmaneser might be provoked unto by the perfidy of the king of Israel,
and by the city of Samaria holding out a three years' siege. This,
though we have no account of as done at that time, yet no doubt was;
even as the same things are predicted of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, and
which were to be done to them, in retaliation for them, though there is
no narrative of them; see [Psa 137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008.md).
