INTRODUCTION TO SONG OF SOLOMON 2

Here begins a new colloquy between Christ and his church; in which they
alternately set forth the excellencies of each other; and express their
mutual affection for, and delight and pleasure they take in, each
other's company. Christ seems to begin, in an account of himself and his
own excellencies, and of the church in her present state, [Sol
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md); then she, in her turn, praises
him, and commends him above all others relates some choice proofs she
had had of his love to her, and of communion with him in his house and
ordinances, to such a degree as to overcome her, [Sol
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md); and then either he or she gives a
charge to the daughters of Jerusalem, not to disturb either the one or
the other in their sweet repose, [Sol
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007.md). Next the church relates how she
heard the voice of Christ, and had a sight of him on the hills and
mountains, at some distance; then more nearly, behind her wall, and
through the lattices, [Sol 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md); and
expresses the very words in which he spake to her, and gave her a call
to come away with him; making use of arguments from the season of the
year, the signs of which are beautifully described, [Sol
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010.md); and requests that she would come
out of her solitude, that he might enjoy her company, whose countenance
and voice are so delightful to him; and gives a charge to her and her
friends, to seize on such as were harmful and prejudicial to their
mutual property, [Sol 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md). And she
closes the chapter with expressing her faith of interest in Christ; and
with a petition for his speedy approach to her, and continued presence
with her, [Sol 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 2:1</span></span>

I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. Whether Christ, or
the church, is here speaking, is not certain: most of the Jewish writers
(t), and some Christian interpreters (u), take them to be the words of
the church, expressing the excellency of her grace, loveliness, and
beauty, she had from Christ; and intimating also her being in the open
fields, exposed to many dangers and enemies, and so needed his
protection. The church may be compared to a "rose", for its beautiful
colour and sweet odour (w), and for its delight in sunny places, where
it thrives best, and is most fragrant. This figure is exceeding just;
not only the beauty of women is expressed by the colour of the rose (x),
as is common in poems of this kind; to give instances of it would be
endless (y); some have had the name of Rhoda from hence; see [Act
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#013.md). No rose can be more beautiful
in colour, and delightful to the eye, than the church is in the eyes of
Christ, as clothed with his righteousness, and adorned with the graces
of his Spirit: nor is any rose of a more sweet and fragrant smell than
the persons of believers are to God and Christ, being considered in him;
and even their graces, when in exercise, yea, their duties and services,
when performed in faith; and, as the rose, they grow and thrive under
the warming, comforting, and refreshing beams of the sun of
righteousness, where they delight to be. The church may also be compared
to a "lily of the valleys", as she is, in the next verse, to one among
thorns. This is a very beautiful flower; Pliny (z) says it is next in
nobleness to the rose; its whiteness is singularly excellent; no plant
more fruitful, and no flower exceeds it in height; in some countries, it
rises up three cubits high; has a weak neck or body, insufficient to
bear the weight of its head. The church may be compared to a lily, for
her beauty and fragrance, as to a rose; and the redness of the rose, and
the whiteness of the lily, meeting in her, make her somewhat like her
beloved, white and ruddy; like the lily, being arrayed in fine linen,
clean and white, the righteousness of the saints; and like it for
fruitfulness, as it is in good works, under the influence of divine
grace, and grows up on high into her head, Christ Jesus; and though weak
in herself, yet strong in him, who supports her, and not she him: and
the church may be compared to a "lily of the valleys"; which may not
describe any particular lily, and what we now call so; but only
expresses the place where it grows, in low places, where plants are in
danger of being plucked and trodden upon; though they may have more
moisture and verdure than those in higher places; so the church of
Christ is sometimes in a low estate, exposed to enemies, and liable to
be trampled and trodden under foot by them, and to be carried away with
the flood of persecution, were it not guarded by divine power; and,
being watered with the dews of grace, it becomes flourishing and
fruitful. But the more commonly received opinion is, that these are the
words of Christ concerning himself; and which indeed best become him,
and are more agreeable to his style and language, [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md); and suit best with the words in
the [Sol 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002), as one observes (a.md); nor
is it unfitly taken by the bridegroom to himself, since it is sometimes
given by lovers to men (b). Christ may be compared to a rose for its
colour and smell; to the rose for its red colour: and which may be
expressive of the truth of his humanity, and of his bloody sufferings in
it; and this, with the whiteness of the lily, finishes the description
of him for his beauty, [Sol 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010.md); and
for its sweet smell; which denotes the same things for which he is
before compared to spikenard, myrrh, and camphire. The rose, as Pliny
says (c), delights not in fat soils and rich clays, but in rubbish, and
roses that grow there are of the sweetest smell; and such was the earth
about Sharon (d); and to a rose there Christ is compared, to show the
excellency and preferableness of him to all others. The word is only
used here and in [Isa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md). Where it
is in many versions rendered a "lily": it seems to be compounded of two
words; one which signifies to "cover" and hide, and another which
signifies a "shadow"; and so may be rendered, "the covering shadow": but
for what reason a rose should be so called is not easy to say; unless it
can be thought to have the figure of an umbrella; or that the rose tree
in those parts was so large, as to be remarkable for its shadow; like
that Montfaucon (e) saw, in a garden at Ravenna, under the shadow of the
branches of which more than forty men could stand: Christ is sometimes
compared to trees for their shadow, which is pleasant and reviving, as
in [Sol 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md). Some render it, "the
flower of the field" (f); which may be expressive of the meanness of
Christ in the eyes of men; of his not being of human production; of his
being accessible; and of his being liable to be trampled upon, as he has
been. And as he is compared to a rose, so to a "lily", for its colour,
height, and fruitfulness; expressive of his purity in himself, of his
superiority to angels and men, and of his being filled with the fruits
and blessings of grace; and to a lily of the valleys, denoting his
wonderful condescension in his low estate of humiliation, and his
delight in dwelling with the humble and lowly: some render the words, "I
am the rose of Sharon, with the lily of the valleys" (g); by the former
epithet meaning himself; and by the latter his church, his companion, in
strict union and communion with him; of whom the following words are
spoken.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 2:2</span></span>

As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. These are
manifestly the words of Christ concerning his church, whom he calls "my
love"; see Gill on [Sol 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md); and was
his love still, though in such company, and in such an uncomfortable
condition. In what sense she is comparable to a lily has been shown in
[Sol 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md); but here she is compared to
one among "thorns": by which may be meant wicked men, comparable to
thorns for their unfruitfulness and unprofitableness; for their being
hurtful and pernicious to good men; and for their end, which is to be
burned; especially persecutors of religion, who are very distressing to
the saints who dwell among them; see [Sa2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006.md); and her being among such serves
for a foil, to set off her excellency the more: and the simile is
designed, not so much to observe that Christ's lily grows among thorns,
as to show that the church is as preferable to such persons as a lily is
to thorns; which is justly remarked by Carolus Maria de Veil; and which
sense the comparison requires, as appears by the reddition, so is "my
love among the daughters": the nations and men of the world, and even
carnal professors, members of the visible church, whom she as much
exceeds in beauty, grace, and fruitfulness, as the lily exceeds thorns.
Ainsworth thinks the "woodbind" or "honeysuckle" is meant, which grows
in thorn hedges, and is sometimes called "lilium inter spinas", as
Mercer observes; this is indeed of a sweet smell, yet very weak, and
cannot support itself; and therefore twists and wraps itself about other
trees, their twigs and branches, "convolvens se adminiculis
quibuscunque", as Pliny (h) says; hence we call it "woodbind", and for
the same reason its name in Greek is "periclymenon"; so saints are of a
sweet fragrance to Christ, and, weak in themselves, cannot support
themselves; yet they twine about Christ, lean on him, and are upheld by
him, and depend on him for all good things. But it is the same word as
in [Sol 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md), and may be rendered
"lily" here as there; and not a "rose", as it is in the Targum, from
which it is there distinguished. The lily is often mentioned in this
love song; it is said to be the delight of Verus (i). Some call it
"ambrosia".

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 2:3</span></span>

As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among
the sons,.... As the apple tree, in a garden or orchard, excels and is
preferable to the wild barren trees of a forest (k), especially it
appears so when laden with choice fruit; so the church, who here returns
the commendation to Christ, asserts, that he as much excels all the
"sons", the creatures of God, angels or men: angels, as the Targum, who,
though sons of God by creation, Christ is the Son of God, in a higher
sense; he is their Creator, and the object of their worship; they are
confirmed by him in the estate they are, and are ministering spirits to
him; and he is exalted above them in human nature: men also, the
greatest princes and monarchs of the earth, are sometimes compared to
large and lofty trees; but Christ is higher than they, and is possessed
of far greater power, riches, glory, and majesty. All the sons of Adam
in general may be meant; wicked men, who are like forest trees, wild,
barren, and unfruitful; yea, even good men, Christ has the pre-eminence
of them, the sons of God by adopting grace; for he is so in such a sense
they are not; he is their Creator, Lord, Head, Husband, and Saviour, and
they have all their fruit from him; and so ministers of the word have
their gifts and grace from him, and therefore Christ excels all that
come under this appellation of sons. Christ may be compared to an apple
tree, which is very fruitful; and, when full of fruit, very beautiful;
and whose fruit is very cooling, comforting, and refreshing. Christ is
full of the fruits and blessings of grace, which are to be reached by
the hand of faith, and enjoyed; and as he is full of grace and truth, he
looks very beautiful and glorious in the eye of faith; and which
blessings of grace from him, being applied to a poor sensible sinner,
inflamed by the fiery law, and filled with wrath and terror, sweetly
cool, refresh, and comfort him. The apple tree has been accounted an
hieroglyphic of love, under which lovers used to meet, and sit under its
delightful shade, and entertain each other with its fruit; to which the
allusion may be; see [Sol 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md); the
apple was sacred to love (l). The Targum renders it, the pome citron, or
citron apple tree; which is a tree very large and beautiful; its fruit
is of a bitter taste, but of a good smell; always fruit on it; is an
excellent remedy against poison, and good for the breath, as naturalists
(m) observe; and so is a fit emblem of Christ, in the greatness of his
person, in the fulness, of his grace, in the virtue of his blood, and
righteousness and grace, which are a sovereign antidote against the
poison of sin; and whose presence, and communion with him, cure panting
souls, out of breath in seeking him; and whose mediation perfumes their
breath, their prayers, whereby they become grateful to God, which
otherwise would be strange and disagreeable;

I sat down under his shadow with great delight: under the shadow of the
apple tree, to which Christ is compared; whose person, blood, and
righteousness, cast a shadow, which is a protecting one, from the heat
of divine wrath, from the curses of a fiery law, from the fiery darts of
Satan, and from the fury of persecutors, [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md); and is a cooling, comforting,
and refreshing one, like the shadow of a great rock to a weary
traveller, [Isa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md); and though the
shadow of some trees, as Pliny (n) observes, is harmful to plants that
grow under them, others are fructifying; and such is Christ; "they that
dwell under his shadow shall revive and grow", &c. [Hos
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007.md). "Sitting" here supposes it was
her choice; that she preferred Christ to any other shadow, looking upon
him to be a suitable one in her circumstances, [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md); it intimates that peace,
quietness, satisfaction, and security, she enjoyed under him; it denotes
her continuance, and desire of abiding there, [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md); for the words may be rendered,
"I desired, and I sat down" (o); she desired to sit under the shade of
this tree, and she did; she had what she wished for; and she sat "with
great delight": having the presence of Christ, and fellowship with him
in his word and ordinances, where Christ is a delightful shade to his
people;

and his fruit was sweet to my taste; the fruit of the apple tree, to
which the allusion is. Solon (p) advised the bride to eat a quince apple
before she went into the bridegroom, as leaving an agreeable savour; and
intimating how graceful the words of her mouth should be. By "his fruit"
here are meant the blessings of grace, which are Christ's in a covenant
way, come through his sufferings and death, and are at his dispose; such
as peace, pardon, justification, &c. and fresh discoveries and
manifestations of his love, of which the apple is an emblem: and these
are sweet, pleasant, and delightful, to those that have tasted that the
Lord is gracious; whose vitiated taste is changed by the grace of God,
and they savour the things of the Spirit of God.

He brought me to the banqueting house,.... Or "into" it (q). The "house
of wine" (r), as it is literally in the original; either the "wine
cellar" (s), as some, where stores of it were kept; or, the "place of
fasting" (t), as others, and, as we render it, a "banqueting house";
where it was distributed and drank; a banquet of wine being put for a
feast, and here the nuptial feast; and may design the Gospel feast in
the house of God, where there is plenty of the wine of Gospel truths,
and provisions of rich food, with which believers are sweetly refreshed
and delightfully regaled: and to be brought hither, under the drawings
and influences of divine grace, is a special privilege, a distinguishing
layout; and show a great condescension in Christ, the King of kings, and
Lord of lords, to take his people by the hand, as it were, and introduce
them into his house, so well furnished, and to a table so well spread:
and so the church relates it as an instance of divine favour, and as a
fresh token of Christ's love to her; which further appears by what
follows: the covenant of grace and the Scriptures of truth may be
thought of as a banqueting house, well stored with blessings, and
promises, and rich provisions; which, to be led and let into, is a
singular kindness;

and his banner over me was love; signifying, that she was brought into
the banqueting house in a grand, stately, and majestic manner, with
flying colours; the motto on which inscribed was "love"; the allusion
may be to the names of generals being inscribed on the banners of their
armies; so Vespasian's name was inscribed on the banners throughout his
armies (u). Christ's name, inscribed on his, was "love", his church's
love; and by which his company or band was distinguished from all
others, even by electing, redeeming, calling love. It may signify the
security and protection of the saints, while in the house of God, and
enjoying communion with him, being under the banner of love, with which
they are encompassed as a shield; and it may denote the very manifest
and visible displays of it, which the church now experienced.

Stay me with flagons,.... Of wine, which is a supporter of the animal
spirits (w). The church was now in a house of wine, where was plenty of
it; even of the love of Christ, compared to wine, and preferred unto it,
[Sol 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md); the church though she had
had large discoveries of it, desired more; and such that have once
tasted of this love are eagerly desirous of it, and cannot be satisfied
until they have their fill of it in heaven: the flagons, being vessels
in which wine is put, and from thence poured out, may signify the word
and ordinances, in which the love of Christ is displayed and manifested;
the church desires she might be stayed and supported hereby, while she
was attending on Christ in them;

comfort me with apples; with exceeding great and precious promises;
which, when fitly spoken and applied, are "like apples of gold in
pictures of silver", [Pro 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011.md); and
are very comforting: or rather, with fresh and greater manifestations of
his love still; for the apple is an emblem of love, as before observed;
for one to send or throw an apple to another indicated love (x). It may
be rendered, "strew me with apples" (y); in great quantities, about me,
before me, and under me, and all around me, that I may lie down among
them, and be sweetly refreshed and strengthened: the words, both in this
and the former clause, are in the plural number; and so may be an
address to the other two divine Persons, along with Christ, to grant
further manifestations of love unto her, giving the following reason for
it:

for I am sick of love; not as loathing it, but as wanting, and eagerly
desirous of more of it; being, as the Septuagint version is, "wounded"
(z) with it; love's dart stuck in her, and she was inflamed therewith:
and "languished" (a); as the Vulgate Latin version is; with earnest
desires after it; nor could she be easy without it, as is the case of
lovers.

His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. The
church, having desired to be stayed, supported, strengthened, and
comforted, presently found her beloved with her, who with both hands
sustained her; which shows his tender love to her, care of her, and
regard for her; and is expressive of the near and intimate communion she
had with him, as the effect of union to him, often enjoyed in his house
and ordinances; likewise of blessings of every kind she received from
him; temporal, mercies, or left hand blessings, which are necessary to
support and carry through this wilderness; and spiritual, or right hand
blessings, as justification, pardon, adoption, &c. and, moreover, may
denote the safety and security of the church, being encircled in the
arms of her beloved, sustained by Christ's left hand, and embraced by
his right hand, out of whose hands none can pluck. Some read the words
prayer wise, "let his left hand be", &c. (b); still desiring further
tokens of his love to her, and more and nearer communion with him:
others read it in the future, "his left hand will be", &c. (c); "his
right hand shall embrace", &c. expressing the strength of her faith that
she should for the future enjoy his gracious presence; and that he would
support her, that she should not sink and faint.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 2:7</span></span>

I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,.... Of whom, see [Sol
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md). There is some difficulty in these
words, whether they are spoken by the church, or by Christ: according to
our version, they are the words of the church, and bids fair to be the
sense; since they are spoken to the virgins, her companions, that waited
on her; and the manner of speech is not by way of command, as by way of
adjuration; and the matter, style, and language of it, Christ being the
church's love; and the phrase, "till he please", best agrees with his
sovereignty and authority, who is at liberty to stay with, and remove
from, his people at pleasure; and the context and scope of the place
seem to confirm it; the church, enjoying communion with Christ, chooses
not that he should be disturbed, and by any means be caused to depart
from her. Others think they are the words of Christ, and not without
reason; since it was the church that was in Christ's arms, and fallen
asleep in them; and the phrase, "my love", is used by Christ concerning
his church, [Sol 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006.md); and not this,
but another, is used by her concerning him; and besides, both the word
for "my love", and that which is rendered "he please", are feminine, and
best agree with her, "that ye stir not up, the" or "this love, until she
please"; so Michaelis (d) interprets and renders the word for "love by
this lovely one"; the word is very emphatic, the love, the famous love,
the well known love (e): add to which, the following words seem to
confirm this sense, "the voice of my beloved", which she had heard,
adjuring the daughters of Jerusalem. This charge is made,

by the roes, and by the hinds of the field; not that either Christ or
his church swore by them; but the words may be descriptive of the
persons addressed by the creatures, among whom they were feeding their
flocks, or whom they delighted to hunt (f); or were loving and lovely
creatures, as they: and the charge is, that they would continue among
them, and mind their business, and give no disturbance to Christ or the
church; or these creatures are called as witnesses to this charge,
which, if not observed, would be brought against them: or the charge is
made by all that is dear, these being pleasant and lovely creatures,
that they would not interrupt the mutual communion of Christ and his
church; or it may be a severe threatening, that, should they disregard
the charge, they should become food as common as roes and hinds; and
that they should be as cautious of stirring up and awaking the person
meant as they would be of starting those timorous creatures. The charge
is,

that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please; or, "till she
please"; if it is the charge of the church, it may lead to observe, that
Christ is the object of the church's love; and that she is his resting
place; that he may not be disturbed and raised up from it by an
unfriendly behavior toward him, or by animosities among themselves; that
saints should be very careful that they do not provoke Christ to depart
from them; and that communion with him is entirely at his pleasure, when
and how long it shall continue; it depends as much upon his sovereign
will as the first acts of his grace towards them. But if this is the
charge of Christ, not to disturb his church, then it may be observed,
that the church is the object of Christ's love, and always continues so;
that the church sleeps and takes her rest in Christ's arms; which is not
to be understood of a criminal drowsiness and sleep, but of comfortable
repose and rest, Christ gives his beloved ones, in communion with
himself; that he loves and delights in the company of his people, and
would not have them disturbed in their fellowship with him; and though,
while grace is in exercise, saints are desirous of enjoying Christ's
presence always; yet, when it is otherwise, they become indifferent to
it, which provokes Christ to depart from them; and therefore it is said,
"till she please": and as this charge is given to the "daughters of
Jerusalem", young converts, or weak believers; it suggests, that they
are apt to disturb both Christ and his church; to disturb Christ by
their impatience and frowardness, like children; hence the church acts
the part of a mother charging her children to be quiet, and not disturb
her loving husband, while she enjoyed his company; and to disturb the
church, through their weakness, not being able to bear the sublime
doctrines of the Gospel, and through their ignorance of Gospel order.

The voice of my beloved!.... So says the church, who well knew Christ
her beloved's voice; which is known by all believers in him, and is
distinguished by them from the voice of others; by the majesty and
authority of it; by the power and efficacy of it; by its directing them
to himself, and by the pleasure it gives them: and she speaks of it as
being very delightful to her; it being the voice of him whom she loved,
and a voice of love, grace, and mercy, of peace, pardon, righteousness,
and salvation; and, being observed before, what follows shows that
Christ is heard before he is seen; he is first heard of in the Gospel,
before he is seen, by an eye of faith: and such would have others
observe the voice of Christ as well as they, for here the church speaks
to the daughters of Jerusalem; and it seems by this, that, by some means
or another, Christ had been disturbed, and had departed from the church
for a while, and was now upon the return to her, which made his voice
the more joyful to her;

behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills;
this may be, understood, either of Christ's first coming in the flesh,
much prophesied of, long expected, and was very welcome: this was
attended with many difficulties, comparable to mountains and hills; that
he the Son of God should become man; that he should obey, suffer, and
die for men, fulfil the law, satisfy justice, atone for sin, and save
from all enemies; but those which seemed insuperable were easily
surmounted by Christ: or of his spiritual coming; sometimes he withdraws
himself, and then returns again, and faith, spying him at a distance,
rejoices at his nearer approach; for impediments in his way, occasioned
by the unbelief, carnality, lukewarmness, backslidings, and ingratitude
of his people, are removed and got over by him, nothing being able to
separate from his love; and his coming, either way, is with all
readiness, swiftness, speed, and haste. And a "behold" is prefixed to
this, as a note of admiration and attention; and is so, whether applied
to the one or other. Christ's incarnation was matter of wonder, "behold,
a virgin", &c. [Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md); and so his
manifestation of himself to his people, and not to others, is
marvellous, "Lord, how is it", &c. [Joh
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022.md); and both comings are visible,
glorious, and delightful. Ambrose (g) has these remarkable words, by way
of paraphrase, on this passage,

"Let us see him leaping; he leaped out of heaven into the virgin, out of
the womb into the manger, out of the manger into Jordan, out of Jordan
to the cross, from the cross into the tomb, out of the grave into
heaven.''

The allusion is to the leaping of a roe, or a young hart, as in [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md), which is remarkable for its
leaping, even one just yeaned (h); so a young hart is described, by the
poet (i), as leaping to its dam the leap of one of these creatures is
very extraordinary (k).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 2:9</span></span>

My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart,.... The church, upon the
swift and speedy approach of Christ unto her, compares him to these
creatures; which are well known for their swiftness (l) in running, and
agility in leaping, as before observed: and, besides these things,
Christ may be compared to them on other accounts; they are pleasant and
lovely, choice and valuable; bear an antipathy to serpents, which they
easily overcome; are very good for food, and very agreeable, and are
long lived creatures (m); Christ is lovely and amiable in his person,
and high in the esteem of his divine Father, angels and men; is choice
and excellent in his nature, offices, and grace; bears an antipathy to
the old serpent, the devil, whose works and powers he came to destroy,
and has got an entire victory over them; and is very agreeable food to
faith; his flesh is meat indeed, and the more so through his sufferings
and death; as the flesh of those creatures is said to be the more tender
and agreeable, by being hunted; and Christ, though dead, is alive, and
lives for evermore;

behold, he standeth behind our wall; not the middle wall of the
ceremonial law, behind which, Christ, under the Old Testament
dispensation, stood, showing himself to believers; nor the wall of our
humanity he partook of, when he came in the flesh, and under which his
glorious deity was in some measure covered and hid; but rather the wall
of our hearts, [Jer 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md); the
hardness, infidelity, and carnal reasonings of it, which are so many
walls of separation between Christ and his people; behind which he
stands, showing his resentment of them, and in order to demolish them,
and get admittance: he is represented here, as nearer than when she
first saw him, even at her very home;

he looketh forth at the windows; this is coming nearer still; for, by
the manner of the expression, it seems that he was within doors, since
he is said, not to look through the windows, but to look forth at them,
meaning the ordinances; which are that to the church as windows to a
house, the means of letting in light into the souls of men; and where
Christ shows himself, in his glory and beauty, as kings and great
personages look out at windows to show themselves to their people:
though Christ may also be said to look in at, those windows, to observe
the behaviour of his people in his house and ordinances, with what
attention, affection, faith, and reverence, they wait upon him in them;

showing himself through the lattice; by which may be meant the same
things, only a larger and clearer discovery of Christ in them, of which
ordinances are the means; and yet, unless Christ shows himself through
them, he cannot be seen in them: and a "behold" being prefixed to these
gradual discoveries of himself, show them to be wonderful! a glance of
him behind the wall is surprising; his looking in at the windows still
more so; but his showing himself, in all his glories and excellencies,
through the lattice, is enough to throw into the greatest rapture, to
fill with joy unspeakable and full of glory! Some render the word
"flourishing" (n), like a rose or lily, or like a vine, or jessamine;
which grow up by a window or lattice, and, seen through them, took very
pleasant and delightful. But the allusion is rather to the quick sighted
roe, or young hart; which, as it is remarkable for its swiftness,
referred to, [Sol 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md), so for the
sharpness of its sight; Pliny (o) says it is never dim sighted; it has
its name "dorcas", in Greek, from its sight.

My beloved spake, and said unto me,.... Christ, the church's beloved,
being so near her, she could distinctly hear and understand what he
spoke, and relate the very words: or, "he answered to me" (p); to a
secret petition, put up to him for a more full enjoyment of him; for
there is mental as well as vocal prayer, which Christ, as God
omniscient, knows full well, and gives answer to: of this may be an
answer to her petitions in [Sol 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005.md);
and as some in [Sol 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006.md); however,
Christ said something after related, that she well knew he spake, and
not another, and to her in particular. What he said follows:

Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away; the affectionate and
endearing titles of "love" and "fair one", have been met with and
explained, on [Sol 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md); and are
repeated to show his ardent love to her, notwithstanding the frame she
was in, which was very probably a slothful one, by the exhortations
given; and to remove her discouragements, arising from her present
state; and to prevail upon her to get up from her bed of carnal sloth
and security, at least to shake off her indolence; and to quit her seat
and company, and go along with him, or where he should direct, since it
would be to her own advantage: for the words may be rendered, "rise up
for thyself, and come away for thyself" (q); it will turn to thy
account, and to do otherwise will be detrimental to thee. The arguments
follow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 2:11</span></span>

For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. A season of the
year which keeps persons within doors, makes going abroad unsafe,
unpleasant, and uncomfortable; very unfit for travelling, roads bad,
rivers impassable, and journeying very difficult; but now this season
being over, and the spring come, the weather fair, and every thing gay
and pleasant, it is inviting to be abroad; winter is by some writers (r)
used not for the season of the year, but for a storm or tempest. Thus
the winter and rain may be descriptive of the state and condition of
Jews and Gentiles before the coming of Christ (s), and which then
ceased; it having been a stormy dispensation with the one, and a time of
darkness and ignorance with the other, [Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md); or rather it may in general
represent the state of God's people both before and after conversion;
before conversion it is a time of darkness, coldness, barrenness, and
unfruitfulness; and which are removed by the powerful and efficacious
grace of Christ: and after conversion it is often a winter season with
them, through the blustering winds of Satan's temptations; the storms of
impending wrath for sin, as they imagine; the nipping blasts of
persecution, and sharp and severe afflictions they are at times exposed
unto: moreover, they are often in great darkness of soul, clouds
interpose between Christ and them; a great deal of coldness attends
them, their hearts are frozen up and hard, and no impression made on
them by the preaching of the word, or by the providences of God; there
is a coolness in their love to God and Christ, his people, ordinances,
cause, and interest; great barrenness and unfruitfulness in them, they
look like trees in winter, and no appearance of fruit on them; their
hands are sealed up from working, and they become indolent and inactive;
and by all these fellowship with Christ is greatly interrupted: but,
when the spring returns again, light breaks in upon them, and their
hearts are melted with a sense of love; they become lively in their
frames, and in the exercise of grace, and are fruitful in good works;
and enjoy much calmness and serenity, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost:
sometimes they think the winter is not over when it is, and fear more
storms are behind, even of divine wrath and vengeance, though without
reason; since Christ has bore all wrath for them, and has satisfied law
and justice, and has delivered them from wrath to come; and he that has
done this says, "the winter is past", &c.

The flowers appear on the earth,.... One of the first signs of the
spring being come (t); and make the season delightful and pleasant; the
sun returning with its warming influences, herbs and plants are
quickened and spring up; fields and meadows, as well as gardens, are
covered with a variety of beautiful flowers, which make walking abroad
very delightful. By these "flowers" may be meant either the graces of
the spirit in the saints, which, when a wintertime with them, seem to be
dead, at least are hid; but, upon a return of the sun of righteousness,
revive and are seen again: or the saints themselves, when in a
flourishing condition, and in the exercise of grace; who may be compared
to the flowers of the field for the production of them in the spring,
which is a kind of re-creation of them, [Psa
104:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030.md); and fitly expresses the
renovation of the Holy Ghost, to which the revival of them is owing; and
for the fragrancy of them, their persons and services being of a sweet
savour through the grace and righteousness of Christ; and for their
beauty and ornament to the fields in which they grow, as saints are
through Christ in themselves, and to the churches and interest of
Christ; and for the gaiety and cheerfulness in which the flowers appear
in the spring season, and so a proper emblem of the joy and consolation
of the saints; where grace revives, Christ returns, and they are
favoured with communion with him. It may not be improper to observe,
that this may represent the large conversions of souls to Christ, and
the numerous appearance of so many beautiful flowers in the church of
Christ in the first ages of Christianity, after a long winter of Jewish
and Gentile darkness;

the time of the singing of birds is come; another sign of spring, and
suits the Gospel dispensation, in which the churches of Christ, and the
members of them, sing the praises of the Lord in psalms, hymns, and
spiritual songs; and particularly young converts, those little birds
that sing in warbling notes and tuneful lays the songs of electing,
redeeming, calling, justifying, pardoning, and adopting grace, to the
glory of God, and to their mutual comfort and edification. Some render
it, "the time of the branch" (u), of the vine putting forth its
branches; or "the time of cutting" (w), of pruning vines, of lopping
trees, and cutting off unfruitful branches; as in the Gospel
dispensation, when the Jewish branches were broken off, and the Gentiles
were ingrafted in, and being pruned brought forth more fruit; and this
agrees with the season of the year, the spring being the time of cutting
and pruning vines (x); though this is by some objected to as
unseasonable;

and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; so one part of rural
pleasures is described by the poet (y), not only by the singing of birds
of various kinds, but particularly by the note of the turtle; which is a
kind of dove that lies hid in the wintertime, or is gone, being a bird
of passage, and appears and returns at the spring, when its voice is
heard again (z); see [Jer 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007.md); for its
voice is never heard in winter, unless on a fine day (a); by which may
be meant, not the voice of the law, as the Jewish writers (b), rather of
the Gospel, the joyful sound, which for a while was heard only in the
land of Judea, called by way of specialty "our land": but either of the
voice of the Messiah himself (c), preaching the everlasting Gospel in
the land of Israel when here on earth; or of John the Baptist his
forerunner; and so Alshech interprets it of Elijah, who was to come
before the Messiah, and refers to [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md). It may design the voice of all
the apostles of Christ, and first ministers of the Gospel (d); or of the
Holy Ghost, as the Targum, who appeared as a dove at Christ's baptism;
and whose voice in the hearts of his people, speaking peace and pardon,
and witnessing their adoption, causes joy and gladness; or of the church
itself, compared to a turtledove for its harmlessness, meekness,
chastity, &c. whose voice in prayer and praise is heard, and is
acceptable to Christ, [Sol 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md).

The fig tree putteth forth her green figs,.... Another sign of spring
being come, nay, of its being pretty much advanced, since Christ makes
this a token of summer being at hand, [Mat
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032). Theopompus (e.md) speaks of figs
in the middle of the spring. This tree puts forth its fruit at once, and
does not flower or blossom (f), wherefore [Hab
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017.md) is wrongly translated; See Gill
on [Hab 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017), though Arianus (g.md)
speaks of its flowering: Aben Ezra thinks the word signifies the
sweetening of the figs, and so points at the time when they are sweet
and eatable. By the "fig tree" may be meant the saints putting forth
their grace in exercise on Christ, who may be compared to fig trees for
their leaves and fruit, and for the putting forth the latter before the
former (h); for the fig tree is a tree full of large leaves, which may
be an emblem of a profession of religion, and of a conversation
agreeably to it, which yet are no covering, only the righteousness of
Christ is that, yet ought to be and are ornamental; and for the fruit of
it, which is wholesome, pleasant, and delightful, as are the fruits of
the Spirit, the fruits of grace and righteousness, fruits meet for
repentance, which ought to appear before a profession of religion is
made. If the Egyptian fig tree is meant, that is a very fruitful tree;
it is said to bear fruit seven times a year, but ripens no other way
than by scratching it with iron hooks (i); and its wood cut down and
cast into water, being dry, sinks, but when thoroughly wet will swim.
Saints should bear fruit always, and ever continue to do so, even to old
age; nor do any ever become fruitful until their hearts have been
pricked and cut by the word of God; and they never grow better, or are
more fruitful, than when attended with afflictions and tribulations;
when they first enter into the waters of affliction, like Peter, they
sink, but, when more used to them, they lift up their heads above them,
and bear up with great courage and resolution. By the "green figs" may
be meant the beginnings of grace in the soul, some stirrings of
affection to Christ, desires of knowledge of him, pantings and
breathings after his ordinances, love to his people; all which appear
soon, are very imperfect, and, like unripe figs, liable to be shaken
off; and it is a miracle of grace that the first impressions of it are
not destroyed by the force of corruption and temptation; and it may be
observed, that grace in its first appearance, though but small, is not
despised, but taken notice of by Christ: yea, he makes use of it as
exercised by young converts to stir up old professors, as here the
church, to be more active and vigorous in it;

and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell; or "being in
flower give a good smell" (k), as the word is used in the Targum in [Isa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005.md); and that vines do flower appears
from the same place, and from [Gen
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#010.md); as well as is observed by
naturalists and others (l); and these flowers, and not the tender
grapes, emit a sweet smell; and, as some say (m), not in the vineyards
only, but in the country round about; and these are fitly mentioned next
to figs, since the black fig is by some called the sister of the vine
(n). By the vines may be intended distinct congregated churches of
Christ, or particular believers; vines are very weak; and cannot bear up
of themselves, must be fixed to some place, and be supported by
something else; and being supported, will run up a great height, and
bring forth much fruit. So saints are weak in themselves, and cannot
support themselves; their strength is in Christ, and they are upheld by
him, and have their dependence on him; and being supported by him they
grow up to the stature of the fulness of Christ; and through their
grafting into him, and abiding in him the true vine, bring forth much
fruit to the glory of God, and such as is not to be found in others. The
wood of the vine is of very little worth or use, [Eze
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002.md); and yet is very lasting. Pliny
(o) ascribes a sort of an eternity to it. Believers in Christ, however
weak and worthless they are in themselves, as are their best works and
services, yet being in Christ they shall abide in him for ever, and
never perish, but have everlasting life. And by the "tender grapes", or
"flowers", may be designed either the graces of the spirit, as before;
or rather young converts, the fruit of Christ's vines, the churches,
who, though weak and tender, yet are dear to Christ; and when there is a
large appearance of them, it is a great encouragement to churches, and
promises a glorious vintage. And the "smell" of these vines, with their
grapes and flowers, may intend the fragrancy, of believers through the
righteousness of Christ on them, and the odour of their graces, as
exercised on him; and the sweet savour of their godly conversation,
observed by all about them.

Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away; repeated from [Sol
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010.md); which shows sluggishness on the
part of the church, that she needed one exhortation after another; and
great love on the part of Christ, that notwithstanding this he persists
in calling her; and even importunity in him, that he will have no denial
(p): and it may be observed, that what is entertaining to most of the
senses is mentioned to engage the church to arise and go along with her
beloved; the flowery fields would be pleasing to her eye, the chirping
birds to her ear, the sweet and ripening figs to her taste, and the
refreshing odour of the vines to her smell.

O my dove,.... An epithet sometimes used by lovers (q), and is a new
title Christ gives to his church, to express his affection for her and
interest in her; and to draw her out of her retirement, to go along with
him. The dove is a creature innocent and harmless, beautiful, cleanly,
and chaste; sociable and fruitful, weak and timorous, of a mournful
voice, and swift in flying; all which is suitable to the church and
people of God: they are harmless and inoffensive in their lives and
conversations; they are beautiful through the righteousness of Christ on
them, and the grace of the Spirit in them; they are clean through the
word Christ has spoken, and having their hearts purified by faith; they
are as chaste virgins espoused to Christ, and their love to him is
single and unfeigned; they cleave to him, are fruitful in grace and good
works; and the church being espoused to Christ brings forth many souls
unto him in regeneration; saints carry on a social worship and delight
in each other's company; they are weak and timorous, being persecuted
and oppressed by the men of the world; and mourn for their own sins and
others, and often for the loss of Christ's presence; and are swift in
flying to him for safety and protection. Under this character the church
is said to be

in the clefts of the rock, the usual place where the dove makes its
nest, [Jer 48:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#028.md); or retires to it for
safety (r). Adrichomius says (s), there was a stone tower near
Jerusalem, to the south of the mount of Olives, called "petra
columbarum", "the rock of the doves", where often five thousand were
kept at once, to which there may be an allusion here; or else it may
have respect to the place where doves are forced to fly when pursued by
the hawk, even into a hollow rock, as described by Homer (t); and may be
expressive of the state of the church under persecution, when obliged to
flee into holes and corners, and caves of the earth; when the Lord is a
hiding place to her, in his love, and grace, and power; and particularly
Christ is the Rock of his people, so called for height, strength, and
duration, and they are the inhabitants of this Rock; and who was
typified by the rock in the wilderness, and particularly by that into
the clefts of which Moses was put, when the glory of the Lord passed
before him: moreover, the clefts of this rock may design the wounds of
Christ, which are opened for the salvation of men; and where saints
dwell by faith, and are secure from every enemy (u). The Ethiopic
version is, "in the shadow of the rock", to which Christ is compared,
[Isa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md); and so the Septuagint
version, "in the covering of the rock", which is no other than the shade
of it. Likewise the church is said to be

in the secret places of the stairs; Christ is the stairs or steps by
which saints ascend up to God, have access to and communion with him;
and the secret places may have respect to the justifying righteousness
of Christ, and atonement by him, hidden to other men, but revealed to
them; and whither in distress they betake themselves, and are sheltered
from sin, law, hell, and death, and dwell in safety. Though as such
places are dark and dusty, and whither the dove, or any other creature,
may in danger betake itself, so upon the whole both this and the
preceding clause may design the dark, uncomfortable, and solitary
condition the church was in through fear of enemies; in which situation
Christ addresses her, saying,

let me see thy countenance, or "face"; and encourages her to appear more
publicly in, his house and courts for worship, and present herself
before him, and look him full in the face, and with open face behold his
glory, and not be shamefaced and fearful; not to be afraid of any thing,
but come out of her lurking holes, and be seen abroad by himself and
others, since the stormy weather was over, and everything was pleasant
and agreeable;

let me hear thy voice; in prayer to him and praise of him, commending
the glories and: excellencies of his person, and giving thanks to him
for the blessings of his grace;

for sweet is thy voice; pleasant, harmonious, melodious, having a
mixture of notes in it, as the word signifies; and so exceeds the voice
of a natural dove, which is not very harmonious: Herodotus (w) makes
mention of a dove that spoke with a human voice; and such a voice
Christ's dove speaks with, and it is sweet; that is, pleasant and
delightful to him, who loves to hear his people relate the gracious
experiences of his goodness, and speak well of his truths and
ordinances; prayer is sweet music to him, and praise pleases him better
than all burnt offerings;

and thy countenance is comely; fair and beautiful, and therefore need
not cover her face, or hang down her head, as if ashamed to be seen,
since she was in the eye of Christ a perfection of beauty.

Take us the foxes,.... Of which there were great numbers in Judea; see
[Jdg 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#004.md); these words are directed
not to angels, nor to civil magistrates, but to ministers of the word;
but whether the words of Christ, or the church, is not easy to
determine; some think they are the words of the church, who had hitherto
been relating what Christ said to her, and who, having neglected her
vineyard, [Sol 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md); and now stirred up
by Christ to a greater care of it, expresses her concern for its
flourishing; and therefore calls upon her attendants and companions, to
assist in taking and destroying those which were harmful to it: but
rather they seem to be the words of Christ continued; since they not
only show the care of his vines, the churches; but express power and
authority over those they are spoken to: and perhaps they may be the
words of them both jointly; since the church, with Christ, and under
him, has a right to stir up her officers to do their work, and fulfil
their ministry, they have received of Christ for her service. By foxes
may be meant false teachers, to whom the false prophets of old were
compared, [Eze 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#003.md); foxes are crafty
and subtle creatures, malignant and mischievous, hungry and voracious,
full of deceit and dissimulation, are of an ill smell, and abominably
filthy; so false teachers walk in craftiness, use good words and fair
speeches, and thereby deceive the hearts of the simple; their doctrines
are pernicious, their heresies damnable, and they bring destruction on
themselves and others; they are hungry after worldly substance, are
greedy of it, and can never have enough; devour widows' houses, and make
merchandise of men, to enrich themselves; they put on sheep's clothing,
transform themselves into angels of light, mimic the voice of Gospel
ministers, use their phrases and expressions, that they may not be
easily discovered; and are abominable in their principles and practices,
and to be shunned by all good men. Now ministers of the Gospel are
ordered to take these, to detect them, and refute their errors, and
reprove them sharply for them; and, after proper steps taken, to reject
them, to cast them out of the vineyards, the churches, and keep them
out. Even

the little foxes; heresies and heretics are to be nipped in the bud,
before they increase to more ungodliness; otherwise errors, which may
seem small at first, soon grow larger and spread themselves, and become
fatal to the churches:

that spoil the vines; as foxes do, by gnawing the branches, biting the
bark, making bare the roots, devouring the ripe grapes, and infecting
all with their noxious teeth and vicious breath (x): so false teachers
make divisions and schisms in churches; disturb their peace; unsettle
some, and subvert others; sap the foundation of religion, and corrupt
the word of God; and therefore by all means to be taken, and the sooner
the better;

for our vines have tender grapes: or "flowers"; See Gill on [Sol
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013.md). The "vines" are the churches;
the "tender grapes", or "flowers", young converts, which Christ has a
particular regard unto, [Isa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md);
and these, having but a small degree of knowledge, are more easily
imposed upon and seduced by false teachers; and therefore, for their
sakes, should be carefully watched, and vigorously opposed, since
otherwise a promising vintage is in danger of being spoiled. Christ, in
this address, intimates, that not only he and the church, but, he
ministers also, had an interest in the vines and tender grapes, as they
have; see [Sol 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011.md); and therefore
should be the more concerned for their welfare; hence he calls them
"ours"; interest carries a powerful argument in it.

\(x\) Vid. Theocrit. Idyll. 1. v. 48, 49. & Idyll. 5. v. 112, 113. So
soldiers are compared to foxes, because they eat the grapes in the
countries they come into, Aristoph. Equites, Act 3. Sc. 1. p. 350.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 2:16</span></span>

My beloved is mine, and I am his,.... These are the words of the church;
who, having had such evidences of Christ's love to her, and care of her,
expresses her faith of interest in him, and suggests the obligations she
lay under to observe his commands. The words are expressive of the
mutual interest had property Christ and his church have in each other:
Christ is the church's, by the Father's gift of him to her, to be her
Head, Husband, and Saviour; and by the gift of himself unto her, to be
her Redeemer and ransom price; and by marriage, having espoused her to
himself, in righteousness and lovingkindness; and by possession, he
living and dwelling in her, by his Spirit and grace: the church also
acknowledges herself to be his, as she was, by the Father's gift of her
to Christ, as his spouse and bride, his portion and inheritance; and by
purchase, he having bought her with his precious blood; and by the
conquest of her, by his grace in effectual calling; and by a voluntary
surrender of herself unto him, under the influence of his grace: hence
all he is, and has, are hers, his person, fulness, blood, and
righteousness; and therefore can want no good thing. Moreover, these
words suggest the near union there is between Christ and his church;
they are one in a conjugal relation, as husband and wife are one; which
union is personal, of the whole person of Christ to the whole persons of
his people; it is a spiritual one, they having the same Spirit, the one
without measure, the other in measure; it is a vital one, as is between
the vine and its branches; and it is a mysterious one, next to that of
the union of the three Persons in the Godhead, and of the two natures in
Christ; it is an indissoluble one, the everlasting love of Christ being
the bond of it, which call never be dissolved; and from this union flow
a communication of the names of Christ to his church, conformity to him,
communion with him, and an interest in all he has. Likewise these
phrases express the mutual affliction, complacency, and delight, Christ
and his church have in each other; he is beloved by his church, and she
by him; she seems to have a full assurance of interest in him, and to
make her boast of him; excluding all other beloveds, as unworthy to be
mentioned with him: of whom she further says,

he feedeth among the lilies; which is either an apostrophe to him, "O
thou that feedest", &c. thou only art my beloved; or is descriptive of
him to others, inquiring who he was, and where to be seen: the answer
is, he is the person that is yonder, feeding among the lilies; either
recreating and delighting himself in his gardens, the churches, where
his saints are, comparable to lilies; See Gill on [Sol
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md), and See Gill on [Sol
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002.md); or feeding his sheep in fields
where lilies grow: and it may be observed, it is not said, he feedeth
on, or feeds his flock with lilies, but among them; for it is remarked
(y), that sheep will not eat them: or the sense may be, Christ feeds
himself, and feeds his people, and feeds among them, as if he was
crowned with lilies, and anointed with the oil of them; as was the
custom of the ancients at festivals (z), thought to be here alluded to
by some who read the words, "that feeds"; that is, sups in or with
lilies, being anointed and crowned with them. The lily is a summer
flower (a); the winter was now past, [Sol
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sol 2:17</span></span>

Until the day break, and the shadows flee away,.... Which may be
connected with [Sol 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md); either with
the former part, "my beloved is mine", &c. [Sol
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md); and then the sense is, as long
as night and day continue, and God's covenant with both stands sure; so
long union to Christ, and covenant interest in him, will abide: or with
the latter part, "he feedeth among the lilies until", &c. even until his
second coming: or with the next clause in this verse,

turn, my beloved; and so is a prayer for Christ's speedy coming to her,
and continued presence with her, until the day should break: which may
be understood either of the Gospel day made by the rising of Christ, the
sun of righteousness, at his first coming in the flesh; when the shadows
of the ceremonial law disappeared, Christ, the body and substance of
them, being come, and the darkness of the Gentile world was scattered,
through the light of the Gospel being sent into it: the words may be
rendered, "until the day breathe", or "blow" (b); and naturalists
observe (c), that, upon the sun's rising, an air or wind has been
excited, and which ceases before the middle of the day, and never lasts
so long as that; and on Christ's, the sun of righteousness, arising with
healing in his wings, some cool, gentle, and refreshing breezes of
divine grace and consolation were raised, which were very desirable and
grateful: or this may be understood of Christ's second coming; which
will make the great day of the Lord, so often spoken of in Scripture:
and which suits as well with the Hebrew text, and the philosophy of it,
as the former; for, as the same naturalists (d) observe, the wind often
blows fresh, and fine breezes of air spring up at the setting as well as
at the rising of the sun; see [Gen
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#008.md); and may very well be applied to
Christ's second coming, at the evening of the world; which will be a
time of refreshing to the saints, and very desirable by them; and though
it will be an evening to the world, which will then come to an end, with
them there will be no more night of darkness, desertion, affliction, and
persecution; the shadows of ignorance, infidelity, doubts, and fears,
will be dispersed, and there will be one pure, clear, unbeclouded, and
everlasting day; and till then the church prays, as follows:

turn, my beloved; that is, to her; who seemed to be ready to depart from
her, or was gone; and therefore she desires he would turn again, and
continue with her, until the time was come before mentioned: or, "turn
about" (e); surround me with thy favour and lovingkindness, and secure
me from all enemies, until the glorious and wished for day comes, when I
shall be out of fear and danger; or, "embrace me" (f); as in [Sol
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006.md); during the present dispensation,
which was as a night in comparison of the everlasting day;

and be thou like a roe, or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether;
the same with Bethel, according to Adrichomius (g); where were
mountains, woody, set with trees, full of grass and aromatic plants; and
so may be the same with the mountains of spices, [Sol
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014.md); where the Ethiopic version has
Bethel; and so that and the Septuagint version, in an addition to [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md); here; see [Kg2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023.md); unless Bithron is meant, [Sa2
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#029.md); a place in Gilead, beyond
Jordan, so called, because it was parted from Judea by the river Jordan:
and the words are by some rendered, "the mountains of division or
separation" (h); which, if referred to Christ's first coming, may regard
the ceremonial law, the wall of partition between Jew and Gentile, broke
down by Christ, and the two people divided by it, which were reconciled
by him; if to his spiritual coming, the same things may be intended by
them as on [Sol 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md); but if to his
second coming, the spacious heavens may be meant, in which Christ will
appear, and which now interpose and separate from his bodily presence;
and therefore the church importunately desires his coming with speed and
swiftness, like a roe or a young hart, and be seen in them; see [Rev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010.md).
