INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 61

To the chief Musician upon Neginah, A Psalm of David. "Neginah" is
either the beginning of a song, as Aben Ezra; or the musical note or
tune of one: or rather the name of a musical instrument, which was
touched by the hand, or with a quill or bow. It is the singular of
"neginoth", See Gill on [Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md). This
psalm was written by David, when at the end of the earth, or land of
Judea, as appears from [Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md);
either when he was fighting with the Syrians, as R. Obadiah, and so was
composed about the same time with the former; or when he was in the land
of the Philistines, being obliged to fly there from Saul, as Kimchi and
others: or rather after he himself was king, since mention is made of
the king in it; and when he fled from his son Absalom, and passed over
to the other side of Jordan, and came to Mahanaim, [Sa2
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#022.md); where very probably he wrote
this psalm. In it respect is had to the Messiah, as in [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md); though Arama thinks it was
composed after the prophecy came to Nathan that David should not build
the temple; see [Psa 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 61:1</span></span>

Hear my cry, O God,.... Being in distress; and which was vocally
expressed with great fervency and importunity;

attend unto my prayer; which psalm was made by him, and not for him;
inwrought in his heart by the Spirit of God, and put up by him with a
true heart and full assurance of faith, and related to his own case in
particular. Aben Ezra thinks that the former word designs public prayer,
vocally and openly expressed; and that this intends prayer in the heart,
or mental prayer; both the Lord hears and attends unto, and is here
requested; which is marvellous grace and condescension in him.

[Psalms 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 61:2</span></span>

From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee,.... Where he now was, as
is observed on the title; see Gill on [Psa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md), though he was distant from his
own house, and from the house of God, he did not restrain prayer before
him, but continued to cry unto him, and determined to do so; and as the
people of God are sometimes forced to flee to distant parts, they have a
God still to go to, who is a God afar off, as well as at hand. It may be
the psalmist may represent the church in Gospel times, throughout the
whole world, even at the further parts of it, in the isles afar off,
where men may and do lift up holy hands to God without wrath and
doubting:

when my heart is overwhelmed; or "covered" (x); with grief and sorrow
for any trouble, outward or inward, and ready to sink, and fail and die.
Sometimes the saints are overwhelmed with a sense of sin, are pressed
down with the weight and burden of its guilt; their faces are covered
with shame and confusion; and their hearts are swallowed up and
overwhelmed with overmuch sorrow, both at the number of their sins, and
at the aggravated circumstances of them; and especially when they are
without a view of pardoning grace and mercy, [Psa
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004.md), [Lam
3:42](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#042.md); and sometimes they are
overwhelmed with afflictive providences; the Lord causes all his waves
and billows to go over them, and they are just ready to sink; and did he
not stay his hand, and stop contending with them, the spirit would fail
before him, and the souls that he has made, [Psa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md); and sometimes with divine
desertions, which cause a "deliquium" of soul, and throw them into
fainting fits, [Sol 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#006.md); and sometimes
through unbelieving frames; and did not the Lord appear to them, and
strengthen their faith, and remove their unbelief, they would sink and
die away, [Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002.md). And at all such
times it is right to cry unto the Lord, and make the following request
to him:

lead me to the rock that is higher than I; not the land of Israel, as
Kimchi thinks, the psalmist being now in the low lands of the
Philistines; nor Jerusalem, and the fort and hill of Zion; he being now
at the extreme and lower parts of the land: this sense is too low. Some
think that some great difficulty is meant; which seemed insuperable, and
like a rock inaccessible, which he could not get up to, and upon, and
get over; and therefore desires the Lord would lead him up it, and over
it, before whom every rock, mountain, and hill, becomes a plain, [Zac
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007.md); but rather Christ is meant, the
Rock of Israel, the Rock of our salvation, and our refuge. He is higher
than David, and all the kings of the earth; higher than the angels in
heaven, and than the heavens themselves, [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md); and who by his height is able to
protect and defend his people from all their enemies; and by the shade
he casts to refresh and comfort them; and by the sufficiency in him to
supply all their wants; for he is as a rock impregnable, and well
stored, [Isa 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016.md). And here gracious
souls desire to be led by the Spirit of God always, and especially when
in distressing circumstances; and he does lead them to his blood for
pardon and cleansing, and to his righteousness for justification and
acceptance with God, and to his fulness for fresh supplies.

[Psalms 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 61:3</span></span>

For thou hast been a shelter for me,.... Or "refuge" (y), from avenging
justice; a hiding place and covert from the storms and tempests of
divine wrath; a shadow and a screen from the heat of Satan's fiery
darts, and the blast of his terrible temptations, [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md);

and a strong tower from the enemy: from Satan the devouring lion, from
furious persecutors, and every other enemy; see [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md); and this experience the
psalmist had of protection from the Rock in former times made him
desirous of being led to it now.

[Psalms 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 61:4</span></span>

I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever,.... Under the protection of the
Lord, as in a shepherd's tent, or as in one belonging to a general of an
army, where are fulness and safety; See Gill on [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md); or else the tabernacle of the
congregation is meant; the house of God, the place of divine and public
worship, where he desired and determined always to continue, [Psa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006.md); or else the tabernacle which was
prefigured by that below, where he knew he should dwell to all eternity.
Kimchi, by "for ever", understands a long time; and Jarchi explains it
both of this world and of the world to come; which is true,
understanding the tabernacle of the church below, and the church above;

I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Or, "in" or "into the secret of
thy wings" (z); this he determined to make his refuge for the present
time, and while in this world; See Gill on [Psa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 61:5</span></span>

For thou, O God, hast heard my vows,.... Or "my prayers", as the
Septuagint and other versions. Vows are so called, because it was usual
to make vows in trouble, when prayer was made to the Lord for help and
deliverance, [Psa 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013.md). This is a
reason why the psalmist was encouraged to put his trust in the Lord,
because his prayers were heard by him; or he was sure they would be, as
he had entreated, [Psa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md). The past
is put for the future, as Kimchi and Ben Melech observe; and it may be
because of the certainty of his prayers being heard; and which may be
concluded from the Lord's declaring himself a God hearing prayer, from
the prevalent mediation of Christ, from the assistance and intercession
of the Spirit, and from the exercise of faith in prayer, and the divine
promises; or while he was crying to God an answer was returned, and he
was delivered out of his troubles, [Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024.md). Another reason follows:

thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name: not the
land of Israel, as Aben Ezra and Jarchi; which was given for an
inheritance to the posterity of Abraham, [Psa
105:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011.md); and which was never more fully
in their possession than in the times of David: nor the tabernacle or
sanctuary of the Lord, as Kimchi; where he desired to dwell, [Psa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md); and now had his request granted:
but the heavenly glory, the incorruptible inheritance, the inheritance
of the saints in light, prefigured by them both; which is the gift of
God their Father to them his children; comes to them through the death
of Christ the testator; is not of the law, and the works of it; is not
acquired nor purchased; but is owing to the free grace of God; to
predestinating grace, as the source of it; to justifying grace, through
the righteousness of Christ, as the right unto it; and to regenerating
and sanctifying grace, as the meetness for it. Wherefore it manifestly
belongs to those that "fear the name of the Lord", himself, his
perfections, particularly his goodness; who adore and admire, serve and
worship him, internally and externally; not with a slavish fear, but
with a filial godly fear. The Targum renders it,

"thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear thy name;''

that in the King's Bible is,

"an inheritance in the world to come;''

so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and the Oriental versions; and which
sense is given by Aben Ezra. It may be understood of them that fear the
Lord, being the inheritance itself; as they are of Christ, David's son
and antitype, and who is designed in [Psa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#006.md), see [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009.md), [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 61:6</span></span>

Thou wilt prolong the King's life,.... Or "add days to the days of the
King" (a). Meaning either himself, who, though his life was in danger by
fighting with the Syrians and Edomites, or rather through the conspiracy
of his son; yet was assured that he should yet live many years more, and
especially in his posterity; and that his kingdom would be established
for ever, as was promised him, [Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md). Or rather the King Messiah, so
the Targum: and Kimchi observes, that if this psalm respects the
captivity, the King is the King Messiah: it may be understood of his
life as man; who, though he died, rose again, and lives for evermore;
and that, as to the glory of God the Father, so to the good of his
people, for whom he makes intercession; and of the continuance of his
spiritual seed, in whom he may be said to live, and his days be
prolonged, [Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md); and of the
duration of his kingdom, of which there will be no end. For it is an
everlasting one, as follows:

and his years as many generations; he living, and his posterity and
kingdom continuing, age after age. The Targum is,

"his years as the generations of this world, and the generations of the
world to, come.''

[Psalms 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 61:7</span></span>

He shall abide before God for ever,.... Or "sit" (b); or "may he sit".
Being raised from the dead he was received up to heaven into the
presence of God, and sat down at his right hand; where he abides for
ever, a Priest upon his throne, having an unchangeable priesthood, [Heb
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#024.md);

and prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him; which, if literally
understood of David, is a prayer that the Lord would show him favour and
kindness, and perform his promises to him, whereby his life would be
preserved from the plots and, conspiracies of his enemies, and his
kingdom be established; or that he might be exalted to exercise mercy
towards his subjects, and administer justice, or execute the judgment of
truth among them; which would make for the preservation of his person,
and the support of his throne and government, [Pro
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#028.md). But as the words may be applied
to the Messiah, they are to be understood, not of the preservation of
his corporeal life while here on earth; but either of the preservation
of his people, in whom he lives, through the mercy and truth of God,
expressed in the exertion of his power, by which they are preserved unto
the heavenly kingdom and glory; or of the security of his kingdom, which
not being of this world, is not supported by worldly power and policy,
but in a spiritual manner, and by spiritual means; such as mercy, or
"grace and truth"; that is, the doctrines of grace and truth, which came
by Christ, and are preached by his ministers, and are the means of
continuing, promoting, and preserving his kingdom and interest in the
world, Or the words may be rendered, "may mercy and the truth of manna
keep thee"; the true manna, Christ; see [Joh
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md); or "mercy and truth, as the
manna, keep thee" (c); as that was kept in the golden pot, [Exo
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#033.md); or rather as that kept and
sustained the Israelites in the wilderness.

[Psalms 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 61:8</span></span>

So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever,.... Or constantly; and not
only in this world, but in that to come, for the favours before
mentioned; for hearing his prayers; giving him a goodly heritage;
prolonging the King's life; and preparing mercy and truth to preserve
him;

that I may daily perform vows; which is done by praising the Lord,
giving him the glory of all mercies, as vowed and promised; see [Psa
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014.md). The Targum adds,

"in the day of the redemption of Israel, and in the day that the King
Messiah shall be anointed, that he may reign.''
