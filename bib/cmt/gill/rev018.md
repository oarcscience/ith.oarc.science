INTRODUCTION TO REVELATION 18

This chapter gives an account of the fall of Babylon, and of the
lamentation of many, and of the joy of others, by reason of it; which
account is published by several angels: the first that declares her fall
is described by his original, descending from heaven; by the great power
he had; by his resplendent glory, and by his mighty cry in publishing
her destruction; which is illustrated by the desolate condition she will
be in upon her fall; the reasons of which are given, became the nations
and kings of the earth had committed fornication with her, and the
merchants of the earth were enriched by her luxury, [Rev
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001.md). Another voice is heard from
heaven, calling upon the people of God, first to come out of her, lest
partaking of her sins they should share in her plagues, seeing her
iniquities had reached to heaven, and were remembered before God; and
next to take full vengeance on her, because she had glorified herself,
lived deliciously, and in great security, [Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md). And then follows a continuation
of the account of her destruction, what her plagues would be, death,
mourning, famine, and fire; and which would be sudden, in one hour, and
certain, from the power and justice of God, [Rev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008.md). Next follow the lamentations of
the kings, merchants, and masters of ships, because of her greatness,
riches, and merchandise, which are all come to nothing, [Rev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009.md). And then the church; the saints,
apostles, and prophets, are called upon to rejoice at the vengeance
taken on her, [Rev 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020.md) upon which a
mighty angel appears, who by an action signifies the manner of her
destruction, and the irrecoverableness of her state and condition, [Rev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md) and declares her utter ruin, by
affirming that nothing that was either delightful or profitable, or
necessary or comfortable, should any more be found in her; giving the
reasons of it, because of her luxury, idolatry, and bloodshed, [Rev
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#022.md).

[Revelation 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 18:1</span></span>

And after these things,.... The vision of the woman on the scarlet
coloured beast, and the interpretation of both by the angel:

I saw another angel; not the Lord Jesus Christ, though the several
things said of this angel agree with him; nor one of the ministering
spirits, though the characters of him will also suit with one of them,
but rather a minister of the Gospel, or a set of Gospel ministers, who
will arise a little before the downfall of Babylon, in the spiritual
reign of Christ; though not the same with the angel of fire, [Rev
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018.md) as some have thought, because of
his illustrious appearance, and the loudness of his voice; but the same
with the angel, or third thundering voice in [Rev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md) for not only the times of both
agree, but the selfsame words are expressed by one as by the other; and
this angel is distinct from him that showed John the preceding vision,
and gave him the interpretation of it, and from all the seven angels
that had the vials, and is described as follows: and first by the place
from whence he came, John saw him

come down from heaven; denoting the suddenness of his appearance and
cry; he came down at once, and cried out immediately; the subject of his
cry, the destruction of Babylon, being what will be at an unawares; and
also the commission and authority of the ministers signified by him, who
will have their warrant from heaven to say what they will deliver; so
that this likewise expresses the truth of their message, since both that
and they come from heaven:

having great power; to do great work, to declare the fall of Babylon the
great: or "having great authority"; being sent from the King of kings,
in his name, as his ambassador, to proclaim what shortly will come to
pass; an event of the greatest importance to the glory of God, the
interest of Christ, and the comfort of his people:

and the earth was lightened with his glory; see [Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002.md) by which is meant the glorious
Gospel of Christ, the light of which will at this then be very great:
these ministers will run to and fro the earth, and knowledge will be
increased, and the earth will be filled with it: the Arabic version
reads, "with the splendour of his countenance"; and the Ethiopic
version, "with the splendour of his countenance, and his glory"; see
[Isa 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md).

[Revelation 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 18:2</span></span>

And he cried mightily with a strong voice,.... Which shows not only the
vehemence and affection of the ministers of the word, who will publish
what follows, but the greatness and importance of it; and this loud
voice may be, as for the sake of the whole church in general, that all
may bear, so for the sake of those of the Lord's people in particular,
that will be in Babylon at this time; and it may have regard to that
deep sleep and spirit of slumber that Babylon itself will be in, which,
notwithstanding this loud cry, will remain insensible of its ruin till
it comes upon her, as was the case of old Babylon, [Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md),

saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen: the whole world is not
designed by Babylon, for it is distinguished from all nations in the
following verse; nor Babylon in Chaldea, which was fallen long before
John saw this vision, but Rome Papal; See Gill on [Rev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md) so the woman is called in [Rev
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md) who sits on seven mountains, and
is that great city, the city of Rome, that reigns over the kings of the
earth, [Rev 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009.md) this is said to be
fallen, because, in a very little time after this declaration, it will
fall; for as yet it was not destroyed, since after this the Lord's
people are called upon to come out of her, and are bid to reward her
double; and it is declared, that her plagues, should come in one day,
and she should be burnt with fire; and an angel after this throws a
millstone into the sea, saying, that so should Babylon be thrown down,
[Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md) and it is repeated to denote
the certainty and utter destruction of her: and which is more fully
expressed by what follows,

and is become the habitation of devils; as old Babylon was of satyrs,
[Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021.md) demons, which appeared in a
hairy form, like goats, and the word is rendered devils in [Lev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007.md) and the inhabitants of Rome now
are no other; the pope and his cardinals, the priests, Jesuits, monks,
and friars, are the spirits of devils, and their doctrines the doctrines
of devils; see [Rev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014.md)

and the hold of every foul spirit: devils are frequently called unclean
spirits, and these appear in desert and desolate places, [Mat
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043.md) where they are either of choice,
or rather are obliged to it; and so the word translated "hold" signifies
a prison, or place of confinement; and such as are comparable to unclean
spirits now haunt and abound in Rome, and its territories; see [Rev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013.md)

and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird; such, as vultures, kites,
owls, &c. which generally reside in desolate and uninhabited places; the
Alexandrian copy, the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, add, "and the hold",
or "seat of every unclean and hateful beast"; and so the desolation of
old Babylon is described by wild beasts and doleful creatures dwelling
in it, [Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021.md). Some consider all
this as a reason of the destruction of Babylon or Rome, because it now
is the residence of persons comparable to devils, foul spirits, hateful
birds, and beasts of prey; but this account rather describes its state
and case in which it will be after its ruin, being never more to be
inhabited by men, in allusion to old Babylon, [Isa
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md).

[Revelation 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 18:3</span></span>

For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication,.... That is, all the nations of the Roman empire, the
European nations, otherwise the Pagan and Mahometan nations have not;
but these have, being made to drink by her, and made drunk therewith,
that is, with her idolatries; See Gill on [Rev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md).

And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her; joined
with her in her idolatrous worship and practices, and encouraged the
same, and obliged their subjects to them in their dominions; See Gill on
[Rev 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#002.md).

And the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of
her delicacies; or "luxury"; which is not to be understood in a literal
sense; though it is true that many merchants, in all ages, have enriched
themselves by sending their commodities to Rome, where, through the vast
consumption and luxuriousness of the place, they have bore a good price;
but this is to be interpreted of spiritual merchants; these are such who
do not merchandise by sea, but are land merchants, the merchants of the
earth, and are said to be the great men of the earth, [Rev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023.md) such as are equal to princes,
lords, and nobles; such are the cardinals, archbishops, and bishops;
though the inferior clergy of the Romish church, who are under these,
may be included: to which may be added, that one part of their wares is
said to be the souls of men, [Rev
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#013.md) which plainly shows what sort of
merchants these are; they are such who make merchandise of men, and
pretend to sell them heaven, and the salvation of their souls; these are
they that deal in pardons and indulgences, which they sell to ignorant
people, and for a sum of money say Mass to fetch souls out of purgatory:
all things have been saleable at Rome, crucifixes, priests, altars,
temples, prayers, heaven, Christ, yea, God himself, as the poet Mantuan
expresses it; and because of these idolatries, and wicked practices,
Rome will be at last destroyed.

[Revelation 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 18:4</span></span>

And I heard another voice from heaven,.... Either of another, or of the
same angel, or rather of God, or Christ himself, since the persons
addressed are called his people:

saying, come out of her, my people; meaning either his elect ones, till
now uncalled, being such whom God had chosen for his people, and were so
by virtue of the covenant of grace, were given to Christ as his people,
and were redeemed by him, though, till this call, in an unconverted
state; or else such who had been secretly called by the grace of God,
but had not made a public profession of the Gospel, nor bore an open
testimony against the Romish idolatry; for as the Lord had a righteous
Lot in Sodom, and saints where Satan's seat was, Rome Pagan, so he will
have a people in Rome Papal, at the time when its destruction draws
near; and these wilt be called out, not only in a spiritual sense, to
quit the communion of the church, to forsake its idolatries, and not
touch the unclean thing, separate themselves from her, and bear a
testimony against her doctrines and worship, but in a literal sense,
locally; they shall be bid to come out of her, as Lot was ordered to go
out of Sodom before its burning, and the people of the Jews out of
Babylon before the taking of it, [Jer
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008.md) to which reference is here had:
and as the Christians were called out of Jerusalem before the
destruction of it: this shows the particular knowledge the Lord has of
his people, be they where they will, and the gracious care he takes of
them, that they perish not with others; and that it is his will they
should be a separate people from the rest of the world; and this call of
his sufficiently justifies the Protestants in their separation from the
church of Rome, and every separation from any apostate church;

that ye be not partakers of her sins: by conniving at them, or
committing the same; and all such are partakers of them, and have
fellowship with these unfruitful works of darkness, that are in the
communion of that church; and those that dwell at Rome are in great
danger of being so, and cannot well avoid it: yea, even those that only
go to see it, and stay but for a time in it, and that not only through
the strength and influence of example, but through the force of power
and authority:

and that ye receive not of her plagues; or punishments; the seven last
plagues, which belong to her, the vials of which will be poured out upon
one or other of the antichristian states, and the fifth particularly
will fall upon Rome, the seat of the beast, and is what is here referred
to.

[Revelation 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 18:5</span></span>

For her sins have reached unto heaven,.... Or "have followed unto
heaven"; one after another, in one age after another, until they have
been as it were heaped up together, and have reached the heavens; the
phrase denotes the multitude of them, God's knowledge and notice of
them, and the cry of them to him; see [Gen
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#020.md) the Alexandrian copy and
Complutensian edition read, "have cleaved", or "glued", and so the
Syriac and Arabic versions seem to have read; her sins were as it were
soldered together, and stuck fast to her, and being joined and linked
together, made a long chain, and reached to heaven, and cleaved to that,
and cried for vengeance:

and God hath remembered her iniquities; and is about to punish her for
them; for as forgiveness of sin is signified by a non-remembrance of it,
so punishment of sin by a remembrance of it, and of the persons that
commit it; see [Rev 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019.md).

[Revelation 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 18:6</span></span>

Reward her even as she rewarded you,.... This is spoken to the people of
God, who are before called out of Babylon; and the chief of them are the
seven angels with the seven last plagues of the wrath of God, and the
same with the ten kings that will burn the whore with fire; these are
called upon to take vengeance, by way of retaliation, for what she had
done to them, in allusion to what is said of old Babylon, [Jer
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015.md) and must be understood not of
what she will have done to them personally, but to their predecessors in
the faith of Christ in former ages; that as she had hated them, and made
war with them, so now they should hate her, and make war with her; and
as she had stripped them naked of their clothes, and spoiled them of
their worldly goods and substance, so now they should strip her naked of
her harlot's attire, of her gold, silver, and precious stones, and make
her and her territories desolate; and as she has burnt many of the
precious saints in the flames, as here in England, and elsewhere, so now
they shall utterly burn her with fire; and as she has shed the blood of
the righteous, and drank it, and been drunk with it, they shall give her
blood to drink; and as she hath killed multitudes with the sword, so now
shall they kill her and her children; see [Rev
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#012.md) nor is this contrary to the
doctrine of Christ and his apostles, and the spirit of Christianity,
which will not admit of revenge, [Mat
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038.md) [Rom
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017.md) since this will not be private,
but public revenge, inflicted by Christian princes and magistrates, who
are ministers of God, and revengers to execute wrath on them that do
evil:

and double unto her double according to her works: the meaning is not to
inflict upon her a punishment doubly greater than her sins, for this
would be contrary to the justice of God; nor does ever God punish men in
this life more, but less, than their iniquities deserve; nor can any
temporal punishment be doubly greater than sin, which deserves eternal
death; and with this she will be punished hereafter, and therefore will
not have her full punishment now, and much less a greater than her sins
required; to which may be added, that this will be according to her
works, her wicked works, and therefore will not exceed the demerit of
her sins: but the sense is, that if it was possible to be done, they
should use her with double severity to that she had used them with;
seeing her sins deserved a severer treatment than even they had had from
her; the phrase signifies an abundant and utter destruction, a
punishment which was suitable and sufficient; see [Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002.md) and it suggests that they should
not spare her, nor pity her, but use her with the greatest severity
imaginable, it being not possible to exceed her due deserts, or what her
works required:

in the cup which he hath filled, fill to her double: not in the cup of
her abominations, her errors, idolatries, and wickedness; but in the cup
of afflictions and trouble, which she wrung out to the people of God, in
that give her double portion: the sense is the same as before.

[Revelation 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 18:7</span></span>

How much she hath glorified herself,.... And acted the proud and haughty
part in exalting herself above all emperors, kings, and princes, above
all kingdoms and states, and also above all churches, assuming arrogant
titles, and even blasphemous names; see [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md)

and lived deliciously: in a very luxuriant manner, as the popes,
cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, monks, and friars have done;
some being clothed in purple and scarlet, and in gold and silver, and
all living upon the fat of the land, and in rioting and drunkenness, in
chambering and wantonness:

so much torment and sorrow give her: by pulling down her pride, which
goes before a fall, than which nothing could more torment and afflict
her; by stripping her of her fine clothes and rich apparel; and by
taking away her fat benefices from her, which will cut her to the heart;
and by burning her with fire, which will be very excruciating:

for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen; a lady of kingdoms, as in
[Isa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005.md) to which the reference is;
having a temporal power and authority over the kings of the earth, and a
spiritual jurisdiction over all churches, apostate ones, being the
mother of harlots; and her "sitting" as such, as it well agrees with the
whore on many waters, and the woman on the scarlet coloured beast and
seven mountains, who are all the same, and is very suitable to
antichrist, who pretends to sit in Peter's chair, and does sit in the
temple of God, as if he was God; so it is expressive of her empire and
government over nations and churches, and of the continuance of it, as
she imagines, see [Isa 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007.md) and so the
Ethiopic version renders it, "I shall reign always": to which she adds,

and am no widow; nor never shall be, as she flatters herself, see [Isa
47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008.md). Were she the true spouse of
Christ, as she boasts herself, she indeed would be no widow, for Christ
is an everlasting and never dying husband; but she is the whore of the
kings of the earth, and though she fancies she shall be no widow, that
is, bereft of people and power, see [Lam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md) because she now sits on many
waters, people, multitudes, and nations and tongues; yet ere long, like
old Babylon, she will have no men in her, but will be inhabited by
devils, foul spirits, and hateful birds:

and shall see no sorrow; through loss of children, power, and authority;
see [Isa 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008.md) but in this also she
will be mistaken; her children will be killed with death, as is
threatened to Jezebel, [Rev 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023.md) and
her plagues shall come upon her at once: now these words may be
considered either as spoken by her when in the height of her power and
glory, as she was about three or four hundred years ago; or just before
her destruction, which seems to be the case, and looks as if she would
regain her power, and be in her former state before her utter ruin; See
Gill on [Rev 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md).

[Revelation 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 18:8</span></span>

Therefore shall her plagues come in one day,.... The seven last plagues,
which will be in a very little time executed upon her, very speedily and
very quickly, one after another, if not all together; and particularly
the fifth vial may be respected, as well as the plagues that follow; see
[Isa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009.md)

death; not the second death, which will not be till after the decisive
battle at Armageddon, when the beast will be taken, and cast alive into
the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death;
but either the pestilence, which is called so, [Rev
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008.md) or rather death by the sword, war,
which will be brought upon her, and in which she and her children will
be slain with the sword:

mourning; for the loss of her children, the destruction of the city of
Rome itself, the seat of the beast, and for the darkness of his kingdom,
the inhabitants of which shall be in such pain, as to gnaw their tongues
for it:

famine; which generally attends war, at least sieges; and it looks as if
Rome would be besieged awhile before it is destroyed, which will produce
a grievous famine in it; this is opposed to her living deliciously, as
well as the two former are to her notion of sitting a queen for ever,
and knowing no sorrow:

and she shall be utterly burnt with fire; the burning of Rome has been
attempted several times, by different persons, and has been burnt in
part, but not wholly; see Gill on [Rev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016.md) but now it will be entirely
destroyed by fire; either by fire from heaven, as Sodom and Gomorrah
were; or by fire breaking out of the earth, it being very manifest that
there are volcanos, burning mountains, and subterraneous fires in those
parts, which seem to be so many preparations in nature for the burning
of that city; or rather by the ten kings, who will set fire to it; and
it may be by all these ways. The Jews have a notion, that, at the coming
of the Messiah, Rome will be burnt (a), as Sodom has been; you will
find, say they (b), that of Sodom and of that kingdom (Rome, of which
they are speaking, and which they afterwards call the fourth kingdom),
it is decreed concerning them both, that they "should be burnt with
fire"; of Sodom, [Gen 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md) and of the
fourth kingdom (Rome), [Isa 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009.md).

for strong is the Lord God that judgeth her; the Alexandrian copy reads,
"that has judged": and so the Syriac and Arabic versions; that is, has
purposed and determined her destruction, and therefore it is
unavoidable; he that has resolved upon it, and foretold it, and has
condemned her to it, is the Lord God Almighty; and he is able to execute
the sentence determined and pronounced, and it is impossible she should
escape: it may be understood of Christ the mighty God, the Judge of
quick and dead; see [Jer 50:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#034.md).

\(a\) Zohar in Gen. fol. 74. 3. & in Numb. fol. 86. 1. (b) Yalkut

[Revelation 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 18:9</span></span>

And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication,....
Idolatry, [Rev 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#002.md)

and lived deliciously with her; [Rev
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md) joining with her in her sensual,
as well as in her idolatrous practices:

shall bewail her, and lament for her: shall mourn inwardly, and by
various gestures outwardly express their sorrow at her desolation; see
[Eze 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030.md) these will not be the ten
kings who will burn the whore with fire, and then repent of what they
have done, and weep over her, as Titus did at the destruction of
Jerusalem, as some Popish writers have fancied, for they will hate the
whore, and eat her flesh; but earthly and idolatrous kings, who will be
in the communion of the church of Rome:

when they shall see the smoke of her burning: as Abraham saw the smoke
of Sodom and Gomorrah go up like the smoke of a furnace; by which they
will perceive that her judgment is come, and her ruin begun.

[Revelation 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 18:10</span></span>

Standing afar off for the fear of her torment,.... Lest they themselves
should share in it, who have partook of her sins; either they will not
be in a capacity to help her, or they will be dispirited, and will be in
awe and dread of God's righteous judgments:

saying, alas! alas! that great city Babylon! that mighty city! it will
aggravate their sorrow, when they reflect upon the former grandeur,
magnificence, power, and authority, of the city and see of Rome, so
often called in this book the great city; and so it is by other writers;
the Jews call it so: they say (c), when the Messiah comes,

"the kings of the world shall be gathered to , "the great city" of Rome;
and the holy blessed God will cast upon them fire and hail, and great
hail stones, (with which compare [Rev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021).md), and they shall perish from the
world, except those kings that do not come there.''

It is common with the Jewish writers to call the Roman empire Edom; and
Magdiel, one of the dukes of Edom, [Gen
36:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#043.md) who has his name from
"greatness", is interpreted by one of their commentators (d) of Rome;
the reason of which, another of them says (e), is because Rome is become
great above all kingdoms: the mount of Esau in [Oba

city" of Esau, which is Rome (f), and the same epithet it has in the
Talmud (g); and Porphyry calls it , "that great city", without making
mention of its name, as here; so among the Latins (h), "Magnoe spes
altera" Romae:

for in one hour is thy judgment come: the Ethiopic version reads, "the
hour of her judgment"; the time of her punishment fixed by God; but the
sense is, that her vengeance was suddenly come upon her; this is the
judgment of the great whore, which the angel proposed to show to John,

And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over over her,....
Who these are; see Gill on [Rev 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md)
and, what their lamentation, [Rev
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#016.md) the reason of their weeping and
mourning follows: for no man buyeth their merchandise any more; what
their merchandise is, is expressed in the two next verses; and this
shows that it is not to be understood merely in a literal sense; for
such commodities in general as are there mentioned, if they do not sell
at one place, they will at another; and the decline of trade in one city
does not put a stop to business all the world over; and often so it is,
that the ruin of commerce in one place is the rise of it in another; and
all the things hereafter spoken of, excepting the last article, are what
will be merchandised in one place or another to the end of the world;
unless the sense should be, that no man at Rome, and the parts adjacent,
will buy of this merchandise any more; but though they should not, this
could not be cause of such lamentation as is afterwards expressed, since
their goods might be sold elsewhere; but it looks as if this must be
understood of such kind of wares as will be disused and despised all the
world over, and they will meet with no customers any where to deal with
them in them.

The merchandise of gold and silver, and precious stones, and of
pearls,.... Things for treasure and ornament, and with which the great
whore is said to be decked, [Rev 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md)
and, literally understood, may denote the vast riches which these
spiritual merchants, or factors for Rome, cardinals, archbishops,
bishops, priests, monks, and friars, bring into their own coffers and
the pope's, by the trade they drive in her wares with the souls of men;
and may have also a regard to what their images, chalices, crowns,
mitres, &c. are made of, and what some of them are adorned with; and as
Tyre, to whom the reference is in the several particulars of this
account, had her merchants for these things, [Eze
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#012.md) so Mr. Brightman thinks that in
these, and in some following ones, Spain is Rome's merchant, which
fetches them from the Indies for her: but these things, mystically
taken, sometimes design the doctrines of the Gospel, [Co1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012.md) and which are to be preferred to,
and more to be esteemed than thousands of gold and silver; and these
Rome's merchants pretended to deliver out; but instead of them, they put
off wood, hay, and stubble, yea, doctrines of devils, and lies in
hypocrisy; and sometimes the grace of God is meant, [Rev
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md) which is more precious than gold
that perisheth; and this they pretend to convey to men "ex opere
operato", in the ordinances, as baptism, &c. and to communicate the
Spirit, with his gifts and graces, for money, which is direct simony;
yea, they pretend to sell eternal life, nay, Christ, and God himself:

and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet: things which belong
to apparel and dress; and, literally taken, the "fine linen" is for
their copes, wore by bishops and by chanters, and sub-chanters, and for
surplices wore by their priests, in imitation of the Jewish priests, and
for Mass clothes, &c. the "purple, silk", and "scarlet", were for the
popes, cardinals, archbishops, and bishops; so the woman on the scarlet
coloured beast is said to be arrayed in purple and scarlet, [Rev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md), Tyre had its merchants for
these, [Eze 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#007.md) the fine linen and
silk may mystically denote the holy lives, good works, and merits of the
saints, those of them called works of supererogation, which become the
church's stock, and they sell out for others that want; which is a
monstrous kind of ware, and a dreadful imposition upon men, since men
cannot be saved and justified by works; and the best of men are so far
from having a redundancy of works, that in everything they sin and
offend, and are greatly deficient: and they are so far from helping
others, that they are unprofitable servants themselves: the purple and
scarlet may signify the blood of Christ, which they pretend to sell in
the Mass; nay, they have pretended to have had the very liquid blood of
Christ, which they have carried in a crystal glass, thick on one side,
and transparent on the other; and so could not be seen by persons in a
mortal sin, until they had given a good deal of money, and then the
clear side was by sleight of hand turned to them; and which was no other
than the blood of a duck, renewed weekly by the priest; which trick for
a long time brought in vast sums of money, and was detected at Hales in
Gloucestershire, in Henry the Eighth's time; or these may intend the
sufferings of the saints, which likewise come into the treasure of the
church, and are at its dispose for money, the virtue of which being very
great for the salvation of men's souls:

and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner
vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble:
things for utensils and furniture, not so much for their houses, as for
their churches; Tyre had its merchants for these, [Eze
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#005). "Thyine wood", Pliny says (i.md),
was very durable, and of it the rafters of ancient temples were made;
and may design such like lasting and odoriferous wood as cypress, cedar,
&c. used in the Popish churches, for the embellishing of them, and for
images in them; it may be the same with the wood of the Almug, or Algum
trees, since these are rendered thyine wood in the Vulgate Latin version
in [Kg1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011.md) vessels of ivory may be
boxes made thereof, in which the host is put, and the relics of saints
are preserved: and "vessels of most precious wood", or "stone", as the
Alexandrian copy, Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions read,

and of brass, iron, and marble, may intend various vessels used in their
churches; as vessels for holy water, fonts of marble, and other valuable
stones, for baptism, censers of iron and brass to burn incense in.
Cocceius thinks that by these vessels of different materials are meant
good men; who are like sweet smelling wood for the fragrancy of their
doctrines and lives; and like iron, brass, and marble, for their
courage, constancy, and patience; and who have been canonized for
saints, which has brought in much money into the pope's coffers: this is
a practice in imitation of the Heathens, who deified men, and set them
over particular days and affairs; and the privileges of such
canonization among the Papists are, that such a saint has his name set
in the calendar in red letters, may have churches and altars dedicated
to him, and his image set up in them, and a holiday be kept for him, and
may be prayed to, and worshipped; a practice dreadfully derogatory to
the glory of Christ's person and office, but is that in which these
merchants have found their account; for through references, commissions,
and reports, for proof of the saint's character and miracles, his
friends are at very great expense before the affair is issued,
especially if rich; our King Henry the Seventh was very desirous of
having his kinsman Henry the Sixth canonized, and solicited the pope for
it, but he would not do it under fifteen hundred ducats of gold, which
the king thought was too much, and so declined it.

And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense,.... Things
for delight and pleasure, for the gratifying of the senses; cinnamon,
and odours were used for perfuming, [Pro
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017.md) anointing with oil was used at
feasts, [Psa 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md) and "frankincense",
or censings, at banquets, and for the regaling of persons after food
(k): these customs obtained among the eastern people. Tyre had its
merchants for these things, [Eze 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#019.md)
and Mr. Brightman thinks Italy is Rome's merchant in these, which it
fetches from Greece, Arabia, and Egypt; it may be these rather respect
the ecclesiastical use of them; "cinnamon, odours", and "frankincense",
may signify the perfumings and censings used in churches, or the burning
incense in imitation of the sweet incense under the law; and "ointments"
may denote their chrism, or anointing with oil at baptism, imagining
that Christ was anointed with material oil at his baptism, whereas it
was with the Holy Ghost: moreover, these things may be mystically
understood, "cinnamon" being used by harlots in perfuming their bed,
[Pro 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017.md) may intend the stews and
brothel houses erected at Rome, and licensed by authority, each whore
paying so much per week; the revenues of which would sometimes yearly
amount to twenty thousand ducats: "ointments" may be understood of
chrism in baptism, and extreme unction at death: "odours" and
"frankincense" may mean their prayers and pater nosters, their prayers
for the dead, which were never made without the pence; hence that
proverbial expression, no pence, no pater noster.

And wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep:
things for civil use; these are things which belong to food, to eating
and drinking, and are the most material and necessary things of life,
[Psa 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007.md). Tyre had her merchants for
these, [Eze 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#017.md) and Mr. Brightman
will have Italy to be Rome's merchant for wine and oil; Sardinia and
Sicily her merchants for fine flour and wheat; Germany for beasts, and
England for sheep: and with respect to the ecclesiastical use of these
things, wine is for the chalice, used in daily Masses, and drank only by
the priests; "oil" for chrism at baptism, and for the extreme unction:
"fine flour" for the Mass, or to make their breaden god of; and "wheat,
beasts, and sheep" for tithes for the clergy:

and horses, and chariots, and slaves; things for splendour, equipage,
and attendance; horses and chariots for the popes, cardinals,
archbishops, and bishops, to ride in state and grandeur, and slaves to
wait upon them. Tyre had her merchants for these [Eze
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#014.md) and Mr. Brightman's opinion is,
that the French are Rome's merchants for horses and chariots, and the
Swiss for slaves, or "bodies", as the word may be rendered, who live by
exercising their bodies, and hiring them out in war; and who are many of
them the guards of the person of the pope of Rome: and last of all it is
added,

and souls of men; still in allusion to the merchandise of Tyre, some of
whose merchants are said to trade in the persons of men, [Eze
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#013.md) which the Targum and Septuagint
render, in the souls of men; the popes have some of them sold their own
souls to the devil, to get into the chair, and, when in, have been the
means of destroying of thousands of others; they assume a power over the
souls of men, of binding and loosing the consciences of men, imposing
new laws upon them, and freeing them from obligation to the laws of God
and men, to the ruin of their souls; and it has been said by their
sycophants, that if the pope should send thousands of men to hell, no
one should say to him, what dost thou? The Romish priests pretend to
redeem souls out of purgatory for such a sum of money, and sell pardons
and indulgences, say Mass, and promise heaven itself for money; and this
they get at the expense of men's souls, by their false doctrine and
superstitious worship, and so make merchandise of them, as is said of
the false teachers, [Pe2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003.md) moreover,
as by "slaves", or bodies, in the preceding clause, are meant such who
serve with their bodies, either by way of attendance, or in unnatural
lust; so by "souls" of men may be meant men of soul, of great natural
wit and understanding, of great parts, abilities, and learning, with
which they serve the man of sin, and his interest, such as Bellarmine,
and others.

And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee,.... Or
"the autumn of the desire of thy soul"; the desirable fruits which are
then in season; the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions render it
"apples", which are ripe in autumn; and may design all such fruit as
Italy abounds with, which will now be destroyed; and seems to point at
the time of year when Babylon's destruction will be: but, in the
mystical sense, these fruits may intend universal dominion over nations
and churches, the obedience of kings and princes, riches, honours, and
pleasures of all sorts; things greatly affected by the Papacy, and of
which a large harvest was expected, but now all will be at an end:

and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee; all
that were palatable to the taste, and pleasant to the sight, that were
excellent and desirable; as the triple crown, cardinalships,
archbishoprics, bishoprics, deanaries, fat benefices, and good livings:

and thou shalt find them no more at all; for this will be an utter
destruction; at the Reformation these desirable things were taken from
her in several nations, and in some places she has recovered them again,
as in Germany and other places; and the outward court, or the reformed
church, sinking into an outward show and form, will be wholly given to
the Gentiles, the Papists, and they will have these things in their
hands again before Rome's utter destruction, but after that they will no
more be regained.

themselves of their being partners in her crimes, and so might justly
fear they should share in her punishment; and it may be, they will

destruction, the quick dispatch and expedition that will be made in it,
by the instruments of it, as in [Rev
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#010.md). Rome was always famous for its
great wealth and riches; the Jews have a saying (l), that if ten kabs of
riches descend into the world, the ancient Romans take nine of them, and
the other the whole world:

and every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as
many as trade by sea, stood afar off; the lamentation of the kings and
merchants of the earth being ended, masters of ships, sailors, and
seafaring men begin theirs: by "ships" are meant dioceses, abbeys,
priories, and monasteries; and by the masters, or governors of them,
bishops, abbots, priors, the heads of monasteries, and of the several
orders of the Franciscans, Dominicans, &c. and by "all the company in
ships", or "every shipmate", the fellows that belong to every religious
house and order; and by "sailors" and "traders at sea", all such who
compass sea and land to make proselytes to the Romish religion, like the
Pharisees of old, and who, as they, make them two fold more the children
of hell than themselves; and, in general, these traders abroad may
design the pope's legates, sent by him into various parts, to collect
his revenues, and the Jesuits, who are everywhere sent abroad to sow
sedition and false doctrine, and the priests that travel about to sell
pardons and indulgences: these

stood afar off; as the kings and merchants before, for fear of sharing
in the condemnation and punishment of Babylon; knowing full well that
they deserved it, having been associates with her in her crimes.

was any city like it for power and authority, for pride and luxury, for
idolatry and superstition, blasphemy and impenitence; the like the

circumstances, denoting disorder, confusion, and debasement; see [Jos

bishops, but the governors of religious houses; these accumulated great
wealth to themselves, and got the best of lands into their possession
for the use and support of their abbeys and monasteries:

by reason of her costliness; or costly things; pardons, indulgences,
absolution, saying Mass, and praying souls out of purgatory, all which
are costly, and hereby these traders have been enriched; and now the
remembrance of these things, of which they will be deprived, will affect

heaven, [Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md) which having called
upon the saints to come out of Babylon, and to take vengeance on her,
now calls upon all good men to rejoice at her ruin, while others were
weeping and wailing; not at that, simply considered, but as the justice
of God is displayed therein: heaven may be literally understood, which
sometimes is addressed when anything of very considerable note and
moment is done or spoken of, whether it be something exceeding bad, as
in [Isa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md) or something exceeding
great and good, as in [Psa 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md) or
else the inhabitants of heaven, either the angels, who as they rejoice
at the good and happiness of the saints, so at the confusion and
destruction of their enemies; and the Syriac version reads, "heavens and
angels"; or else the souls of men departed, particularly the souls under
the altar, that have been long crying for vengeance on account of the
shedding of their blood, [Rev 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md) who
may be made acquainted with Rome's destruction; or rather the true
church of Christ upon earth, which in this book often goes by the name
of heaven, in opposition to the apostate church, called the earth,
because its members, doctrines, and ordinances, are from heaven, and its
happiness lies there:

and ye holy apostles and prophets; the Alexandrian copy and
Complutensian edition read, "and the saints, and the apostles, and
prophets"; making three distinct sorts of persons, of which heaven, or
the church, consists: by "saints" may be meant private members of
churches, who are sanctified by the Spirit of God, and live holy lives
and conversations; and by "apostles", not the twelve apostles, or
persons in such an office as they were, but ordinary ministers of the
word, who are sent forth to preach the Gospel, and will be upon the spot
at the destruction of Babylon, and will be such as shall have preached
and defended the pure apostolic doctrine; and by "prophets" are intended
not the prophets of the Old Testament, nor such under the New who had
the gift of foretelling things to come, but such who have a gift of
interpreting the Scriptures and preaching the Gospel; the same with the
two witnesses, who till this time will have prophesied in sackcloth, but
shall now put it off, and put on the garments of praise and joy:

for God hath avenged you on her; or "judged your judgment on her"; that
is, has executed righteous judgment on her, for all the evils done by
her to the saints in ages past, the predecessors of the persons here
mentioned, as well as to themselves: vengeance belongs to the Lord, and
he will avenge his elect sooner or later.

saying, thus with violence shall that great city be thrown down, and

shall be heard no more at all in thee: the words seem to be taken from

loss of every thing that was delightful and pleasant to the ear in
private houses, at festivals, and nuptials, and the like, but the
ceasing of church music; there will be no more bells, nor organs, or any
other instruments of music; no more chanters, and sub-chanters,
choristers, singing men and boys:

and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be shall be, found any more in
thee; which are very useful and necessary in cities and societies; it is
threatened to Judah, that the cunning artificer should be taken from
her, [Isa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003.md) and it is reckoned as a
considerable part of the distress of the captivity that the carpenters
and smiths were away from Jerusalem, [Jer
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md) and this judgment may fall on
Rome for her worshipping idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood,
the works of men's hands, artificers and craftsmen, and who are employed
in making other trinkets and wares for antichrist:

and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; to
grind corn with, see [Jer 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md) there
will be a famine at the time that Rome is besieged, [Rev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008.md) and after it is destroyed, there
will be no corn to grind, nor inhabitants to eat it, and so no use of
the millstone; this is said in opposition to her luxurious and delicious
living, [Rev 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md) and this may also
refer to feasts and rich entertainments, for which spices were ground
and prepared by an hand mill (m) in the house; and so may signify here
that there would be no more of such entertainments and rich living; with
which sense agrees what follows. This clause is wanting in the Syriac

comfortable in life; see [Jer 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md)

the night; and where candles have been lighted up for the dead, there
will not be one for the use of the living:

and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more
at all in thee: there will be no marrying, nor giving in marriage; no
procreation of children, or propagation of posterity, in this place;
which denotes the utter extirpation of the inhabitants of it; the
phrases are taken from [Jer 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034.md) [Jer
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md) and this will be in righteous
retaliation for the prohibition of marriage; which God has instituted,
and is honourable, [Ti1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002.md) the
reasons of Babylon's destruction follow:

for thy merchants were the great men of the earth: in allusion to the
merchants of Tyre, said to be princes, [Isa
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md) for by trading and dealing in the
wares and merchandise of Rome, persons of mean extract, and of very low
circumstances of life, have grown exceeding rich, and have equalled the
princes of the earth; as for instance, Cardinal Wolsey here in England,
a butcher's son at Ipswich; and on the other hand, the princes and great
men of the earth have become Rome's merchants, and have thought it an
high honour to get a cardinal's hat, as the Cardinals Albertus duke of
Austria, Bourbon, Pool, and others, mentioned by Brightman:

for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived; meaning her false
doctrines, traditions, idolatry, superstition, and will worship, with
which, as another Jezebel, she has bewitched, allured, and deceived the
nations of the empire, and the kings thereof, [Rev
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md).

[Revelation 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rev 18:24</span></span>

And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,.... Such as
before mentioned, in [Rev 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020.md) this
is another reason of her destruction, besides her luxury and idolatry,
namely, her shedding the blood of the saints, with which she is said to
be drunk, and therefore blood is now given her to drink, [Rev
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#006.md) for she will now be found guilty
of slaying the witnesses, who are meant by the prophets and saints, that
have been from the beginning of the apostasy:

and of all that were slain upon the earth: not only of those that have
been slain in the city of Rome, but of all those that have been slain
throughout the empire; they being slain by her order, or with her
consent, and she conniving at it, encouraging it, and therefore will be
justly chargeable with it all; see [Mat
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031.md) the Ethiopic version adds, "for
the name of Christ".
