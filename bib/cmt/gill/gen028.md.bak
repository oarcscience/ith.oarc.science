INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 28

In this chapter an account is given of the charge Isaac gave to Jacob
not to marry a Canaanitess, but to go to Padanaram, and take a wife from
his mother's family, and of his blessing him before he sent him away,
[Gen 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001.md); of the notice that Esau
took of this blessing and charge, which led him to take a wife of the
family of Ishmael, [Gen 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#006.md); of the
dream of the ladder, which Jacob had in his way to Haran, [Gen
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#010.md); of the blessing which God
conferred upon him there, [Gen 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013.md);
of the awfulness of the place upon his awaking, and of his erecting a
pillar in it, and giving a name to it, [Gen
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016.md); and of the vow he made to God,
should he be supplied with the necessaries of life, and be kept in
safety by him, [Gen 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020.md).

[Genesis 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 28:1</span></span>

And Isaac called Jacob,.... Or therefore (d), because of what Rebekah
had said to him, related in the latter part of the preceding chapter, he
sent for Jacob to come to him from his tent or apartment where he was,
or from the field where he was keeping the flocks; thus paying a great
regard to what his wife Rebekah had suggested to him, and which appeared
to him very right and reasonable:

and blessed him; he did not send for him to chide and reprove him for
his fraudulent dealings with him to get the blessing from his brother,
much less to revoke it, but to confirm it; which was necessary to
prevent doubts that might arise in the mind of Jacob about it, and to
strengthen him against the temptations of Satan; since he was about to
be sent away from his father's house solitary and destitute, to go into
another country, where he was to be for awhile in a state of servitude;
all which might seem to contradict the blessing and promises he had
received, and would be a trial of his faith in them, as well as a
chastisement on him for the fraudulent manner in which he obtained them:

and charged him, and said unto him, thou shall not take a wife of the
daughters of Canaan; it was time that he was married; for he was now, as
the Jewish writers (e) say, seventy seven, years of age, which exactly
agrees with what Polyhistor (f), an Heathen writer, relates from
Demetrius, that Jacob was seventy seven years of age when he came to
Haran, and also his father Isaac was then one hundred and thirty seven
years old; and so it is calculated by the best chronologers, and as he
must be, since he was born when his father was sixty years of age; see
Gill on [Gen 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001.md); and being now
declared the heir of the promised land, it was proper he should marry,
but not with any of the Canaanites, who were to be dispossessed of the
land of Canaan, and therefore their seed, and Abraham's, to whom it was
given, must not be mixed. Isaac takes the same care, and gives the same
charge concerning the marriage of his son Jacob, on whom the entail of
the land was settled, as his father Abraham did concerning his, [Gen
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#003.md).

[Genesis 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 28:2</span></span>

Arise, go to Padanaram,.... Of this place; see Gill on [Gen
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020.md); either he is bid to go
directly, in haste and alone; perhaps by this time Rebekah had given
Isaac some hint of the ill design of Esau against him, which made Isaac
the more urgent upon him to be gone, as well as it was high time he had
took to himself a wife:

to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; who though now dead in all
probability, yet the house and family went by his name:

and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's
brother: who had daughters unmarried, of which no doubt Isaac and
Rebekah had knowledge, a correspondence being kept up between the two
families, though at a great distance.

[Genesis 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 28:3</span></span>

And God Almighty bless thee,.... This is not a new blessing, distinct
from that in [Gen 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001.md), but the same;
there it is expressed in general, here the particulars of it are given;
and by which it appears, that Isaac's blessing Jacob was a prayer,
wishing a blessing from God upon him, and was the prayer of faith,
delivered out under the spirit of prophecy; and they are blessed indeed
that are blessed of God, and they must needs be blessed who are blessed
by the Almighty; for what is it he cannot do or give? The Targum of
Jonathan adds,"with much riches;''but no doubt all kind of blessings are
included, both temporal and spiritual:

and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee; with a numerous offspring:

that thou mayest be a multitude of people; or an "assembly" or
"congregation" (g) of them; which may all unite in one body and make one
nation, as the twelve tribes descending from Jacob did.

[Genesis 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 28:4</span></span>

And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with
thee,.... Which was promised to Abraham, and was entailed upon Isaac and
his seed, and now upon Jacob and his seed, which follows:

that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God
gave to Abraham; the land of Canaan, which was given to Abraham by
promise, but not in possession; he was a sojourner and stranger in it,
and so Isaac had been all his days, and now Jacob, who through the
blessing was become heir of it; but as yet neither he nor his posterity
must enjoy it, but be strangers and sojourners in it, for the exercise
of faith, and for the leading of their minds off of all earthly
enjoyments, to the better and heavenly country God has provided for his
people; see [Heb 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009.md).

[Genesis 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 28:5</span></span>

And Isaac sent away Jacob,.... From Beersheba; not in anger, or in a
dishonourable way, but took his leave of him no doubt in an affectionate
manner; as it is clear he went with his blessing, and had his good
wishes for a prosperous journey:

and he went to Padanaram; which from Beersheba, according to some (h),
was four hundred and eighty miles:

unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian; some versions make Laban to be
the Syrian, others Bethuel; it is a matter of no great moment which is
here so called, since they were both called Syrians, see [Gen
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020.md),

the brother of Rebekah; this refers to Laban, for Bethuel was her
father:

Jacob's and Esau's mother; Jacob is set first, not only as being most
beloved by his mother, but as now having the birthright and the
blessing.

\(h\) Bunting's Travels, p. 72.

[Genesis 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 28:6</span></span>

And when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob,.... Had conferred the
blessing before given, or had wished him a good journey; which perhaps
may be all that Esau understood by it, and so was not so much offended
with it:

and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; which
likewise might not be displeasing to him, partly as he understood it to
be only on account of taking a wife, and not on account of his ill
design upon him, which he might imagine his parents knew nothing of; and
partly as he would now be out of the way, and he might find means the
easier to ingratiate himself into his father's favour, and get him to
revoke the blessing, and settle the inheritance upon him:

and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, thou shalt not
take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; or of the Canaanites, of any of
the tribes or nations that belonged to that people, whether Hittites or
others.

[Genesis 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 28:7</span></span>

And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother,.... As it became him,
and as it becomes all children to be obedient to their parents in all
things lawful they command them; and it would have been well if Esau had
been obedient to them also in a like case, the case of his marriage:

and was gone to Padanaram; as they had enjoined him, to take a wife from
thence.

[Genesis 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 28:8</span></span>

And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his
father. Who he perceived was displeased with the daughters of Canaan, or
that they were "evil in his eyes" (i), offensive to him, and disapproved
of by him, because of their ill manners: Rebekah is not mentioned, whose
displeasure he cared not for.

\(i\) "malae in oculis", Montanus, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator,

[Genesis 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 28:9</span></span>

Then went Esau unto Ishmael,.... Not to Ishmael in person, for he was
now dead, [Gen 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#017.md), and had been
dead as is reckoned about fourteen years before this, but to the house
of Ishmael:

and took unto the wives which he had; the daughters of Heth, and who
seem by this to be both alive at this time:

Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son; the same with
Bashemath, [Gen 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#003.md); as the Targum of
Jonathan expresses it, this person having two names, and is further
described:

the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife; who was the eldest son of
Ishmael, and, his father being dead, was the principal in the family;
and this woman Esau took to wife was his sister by his mother's side, as
the above Targum expresses, as well as by his father's; whereas he might
have other sisters only by his father's side, he having had more wives
than one. This Esau seems to have done in order to curry favour with his
father, who was displeased with his other wives, and therefore takes one
of his father's brother's daughters; but in this he acted an unwise
part, on more accounts than one; partly as it was taking to wife the
daughter of one that was cast out of his grandfather's house, and had
been a persecutor of his father, and therefore not likely to be
agreeable to him; and partly as being a daughter of the bondmaid's son:
children born of her could not inherit the land promised to Abraham and
Isaac.

[Genesis 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 28:10</span></span>

And Jacob went out from Beersheba,.... Where Isaac and Rebekah now
lived: from hence he went alone, without any servants to attend him,
though perhaps not without letters of recommendation from his parents,
testifying their affection to him, and that he came with their knowledge
and consent, and was their heir, as Isaac had been to Abraham; nor
without provisions, at least not without money to purchase them by the
way, as appears by the oil he had, [Gen
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018.md),

and went toward Haran: for thither he could not get in one day, being
many days' journey; See Gill on [Gen
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#005.md).

[Genesis 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 28:11</span></span>

And he lighted upon a certain place,.... Without any design to take up
there, but as it were casually to him, though very providentially, after
he had travelled forty eight miles; for so far it seems it was from
Beersheba to Luz or Bethel (k), as this place was called:

and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; which hindered his
pursuing his journey any further that day, and therefore took a night's
lodging here: and he took of the stones of that place; one of the stones
that lay there, as Aben Ezra and Ben Melech rightly interpret it, as
appears from [Gen 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013.md); though the
Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem will have it, that these were four
stones that he took, and that by a miracle they became one, and is one
of the five miracles they say were done for Jacob on that day:

and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place and slept;
being weary with his journey though he had no other bed than the earth,
and for his pillow a stone, and for his canopy or curtain the open
heaven; a different lodging this from what he had been used to in his
father's house, and under the indulgence of his mother; and one would
wonder how he could sleep in such circumstances, and that he did not
take cold, after such a journey: but it must be considered that it was
in a warm climate, and in an age when they did not use themselves to
such soft beds as now, and especially that he was under the particular
care of divine Providence.

\(k\) Bunting's Travels, p. 72.

[Genesis 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 28:12</span></span>

And he dreamed,.... As he slept; not a common dream, but under divine
direction and influence:

and, behold, a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to
heaven: denoting either the providence of God, and the various steps of
it, bringing about his own glory and the good of his people; and which
is steady, firm, and sure, and reaches to all things here on earth; and
in an especial manner is concerned about the people of God, their
protection and safety; and is directed and governed according to the
will, counsels, and purposes of God in heaven; a view of which must be
very encouraging to Jacob in his present circumstances: or else the
incarnation and mediation of Christ, who in his human nature was to be
in the fulness of time on earth, there to live a while, obey, suffer,
and die, and so was the ladder set on earth; and his divine nature was
the top of it, which reached heaven; here he was in that nature before
his incarnation, and from hence he came; and indeed here he was in that
when on earth; and as man, he ascended on high when he had done his
work, and is now higher than the heavens; he may be fitly represented
hereby as the Mediator, who has reconciled things in heaven and things
on earth, and has as it were joined and united heaven and earth
together: and the various rungs in this ladder, so considered, are
Christ's interposition as a surety front eternity; his incarnation in
time; his being under the law, and his obedience to it; his sufferings,
the shedding of his blood, and the death of the cross; his resurrection
from the dead, ascension to heaven, session at the right hand of God,
and intercession there. Moreover this may point out to us Christ as the
way to his Father, of access unto him, and acceptance with him, by which
he communicates the blessings of his grace to men, and by which they
ascend to God with their prayers and praises to him: as also as being
the way to heaven and eternal happiness; the various steps to which are
election in him, redemption by him, regeneration by his Spirit and
grace, the several graces of his Spirit, faith, hope, and love,
justification by his righteousness, pardon by his blood, adoption
through him, and the resurrection of the dead:

and, behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it: which may
be expressive of the employment of angels in the affairs of Providence,
who receive their commission from heaven, and execute it on earth, in
which they are diligent, faithful, and constant; and of the ministry of
them, both to Christ personal, and to his church and people, even to
every particular believer; see [Joh
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051.md).

[Genesis 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 28:13</span></span>

And behold, the Lord stood above it,.... Ordering, directing, and
overruling all things in Providence, for the glory of his name and the
good of his people; and may signify, as the ladder may be a figure of
Christ, that Jehovah the Father, is above him, as man and Mediator, and
makes himself known in and by him, and delivers out all his blessings
and promises through him, both temporal and spiritual, and such as
follow:

and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac:
their covenant God and Father in Christ, who had made promises unto
them, and bestowed blessings upon them; and the same was and would
continue to be the God of Jacob, which is strongly intimated:

the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;
meaning not that small pittance of land only on which his body then lay,
and which it covered, but all the land of which it was a part, even the
whole land of Canaan; hereby entailing it on him and his seed, and so
explaining and confirming the blessing of his father Isaac; and by which
it appears, that all that had been done was under a divine direction,
and according to the will of God.

[Genesis 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 28:14</span></span>

And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth,.... Innumerable, see
[Gen 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016.md),

and thou shalt spread abroad to the west; or "the sea", the
Mediterranean sea, which was west of the land of Canaan:

and to the east, and to the north, and to the south; not of the whole
world, but of the land of Canaan: the meaning is, that his posterity
should be numerous, and break out and spread themselves like a flood of
water, and reach to the utmost bounds of the land on all sides:

and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be
blessed; that is, in that eminent and principal seed that should spring
from him, the Messiah, in whom some of all nations should, as they have
been, be blessed with all spiritual blessings, as redemption, peace,
pardon, justification, adoption, and eternal life; the same promise had
been made to Abraham, was renewed to Isaac, and now confirmed to Jacob,
see [Gen 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md).

[Genesis 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 28:15</span></span>

And, behold, I am with thee,.... Though alone, at a distance from his
father's house, no friend to keep him company, or servant to attend him;
but the presence of God here promised is abundantly more than an
equivalent for all this:

and will keep thee in all places, whither thou goest; from beasts of
prey, in lonesome places through which he might travel; from thieves and
robbers, to whom he might be exposed; from his brother Esau, and all his
ill designs against him; and from being always under the bondage of
Laban, into which he would be brought:

and will bring thee again into this land: the land of Canaan, which was
entailed on him and his seed for an inheritance; but, as he would now
soon be out of it, and continue in another land for many years, as he
did, which would make it look very unpromising that he and his seed
should inherit it, this is said unto him:

for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to
thee of; made good all his promises to him: and the sense is, not that
he would then leave him when he had done so, but as not before, so never
after; for God never does, nor never will, utterly forsake his people.

[Genesis 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 28:16</span></span>

And Jacob awaked out of his sleep,.... Which had been sweet unto him,
and out of his dream, it being now over; and it having left such a
weight upon his mind, and such an awe upon his spirits, it might tend
the sooner to awaken him; what time it was is not said, perhaps it was
in the middle of the night or towards morning, since after this it is
said that he rose early in the morning:

and he said, surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not; God is
everywhere, in a general way, upholding all things by his power, as he
is immense and omnipresent; but here he was in a special sense, by some
signal token of his presence; by a stream of light and glory darting
from the heavens, hence Onkelos and Jonathan paraphrase it,"the glory of
the Lord, and the glory of the majesty of the Lord;''and by the
appearance of angels, and by the communications of his mind and will,
and grace to Jacob, and that communion he had with him in his dream, of
which he was very sensible: for, when he says, "I knew it not", the
meaning is, he did not think or expect to meet with God in such a place;
he did not know that God ever appeared anywhere but in the houses of his
people, such as his father's house; and in the congregation of the
faithful, or where the saints met for public worship, or where an altar
was erected for God: though sometimes God is present with his people,
and they are not sensible of it; as the church in [Isa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md); and as Mary, when Christ was at
her elbow, and she knew him not, [Joh
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#013.md).

[Genesis 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 28:17</span></span>

And he was afraid,.... Not with a servile but filial fear; not with a
fear of the wrath and displeasure of God, but with a fear of his grace
and goodness; not with a fear of distrust of it, of which he had just
had such a comfortable assurance; but with an awe of the greatness and
glory of God, being conscious of his own unworthiness to receive such
favours from him:

and said, how dreadful is this place! not terrible and horrible, being
not like Mount Sinai, but like Sion; not as the suburbs of hell, but as
the gate of heaven majestic and venerable, because of the glory of God
that appeared in it, whose name is holy and reverend and because of the
holy angels here present: and so the church, of which this was an
emblem, is a solemn assembly, awful and venerable; a city of
solemnities, because of the worship of God in it, and his presence
there; who is to be feared in the assembly of his saints, and to be had
in reverence of all that are about him; and where persons should behave
in a serious and solemn manner. The Targum of Jonathan is,"how
tremendous and praiseworthy is this place! this is not a common place:"

this is none other but the house of God; wherefore he afterwards called
it Bethel, which signifies the house of God; and so the church of God is
often called, [Psa 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006.md); which is of
God's building, where he dwells, and his family is, of which he is the
master and governor; which he beautifies and adorns, fills, repairs, and
defends:

and this is the gate of heaven: Mr. Mede renders it "the court of
heaven", because of the angels; since in gates justice was administered
by kings, attended with their retinue; but royal courts were not kept
there, only courts of judicature: this place seems to be so called,
because the heavens were opened and the glory of God was seen, attended
by his angels, who were passing and repassing, as people through the
streets of a city; and was an emblem of the church of Christ, who is
figured by the ladder set on earth, whose top reached to heaven, the
door, the gate, the way of ascent to it; here he is preached in the word
as the way of salvation, the way to heaven and eternal happiness; here
he is held forth in the ordinances; here he grants his presence to his
people, and indulges them with communion with him, which makes it like
and next to heaven unto them: and, generally speaking, though not
always, God brings his people to heaven this way, through a Gospel
church state, and by means of the word and ordinances; and here angels
also attend, [Co1 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010.md).

[Genesis 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 28:18</span></span>

And Jacob rose up early in the morning,.... In order to proceed on his
journey, being comfortably refreshed both in body and mind: but first he

took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a
pillar; not for a statue or an idol to be worshipped, but for a memorial
of the mercy and goodness of God unto him, see [Jos
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#003.md); indeed, among the Heathens,
stones, even rude and unpolished ones, were worshipped as gods; and this
was the ancient custom among the Greeks, and which, as Pausanias (l)
says, universally obtained among them:

and poured oil upon the top of it; which he had brought with him for
necessary uses in his journey, or fetched from the neighbouring city;
the former is most likely: and this he did, that he might know it again
when he returned, as Aben Ezra remarks, and not for the consecration of
it for religious use; though it is thought, by some learned men (m),
that the Phoenicians worshipped this stone which Jacob anointed; and
that from this anointed stone at Bethel came the Boetylia, which were
anointed stones consecrated to Saturn and Jupiter, and others, and were
worshipped as gods; the original of which Sanchoniatho (n) ascribes to
Uranus, who, he says, devised the Boetylia, forming animated stones,
which Bochart renders anointed stones; and so Apuleius (o), Minutius
Felix (p), Arnobius (q), and others, speak of anointed stones,
worshipped as deities; and hence it may be through the early and ancient
abuse of such pillars it was, that they were forbidden by the law of
Moses, and such as the Heathens had erected were to be pulled down, [Lev
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md).

And he called the name of that place Bethel,.... The house of God, which
he took this place to be:

but the name of that city was called Luz at the first; which signifies
an almond or hazel nut, [Gen 30:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#037.md);
perhaps from the number of this sort of trees that grew there, under
which Jacob might lay himself down, which was probably in the field of
Luz; and being at night, he might not know there was a city so near,
until the morning. Though Josephus (r) says he did it purposely, out of
hatred to the Canaanites, and chose rather to lie under the open air.
This was about twelve miles from Jerusalem, as Jerom (s) says.

And Jacob vowed a vow,.... Which is the first vow we read of in
Scripture:

saying, if God will be with me; the word if is not a sign of doubting,
but is either an adverb of time, and may be rendered, "when God shall be
with me" (t); or as a supposition, expressive of an inference or
conclusion drawn, "seeing God will be with me" (u); which he had the
utmost reason to believe he would, since he had not only promised it,
but had so lately granted him his presence in a very singular and
remarkable manner, referring to the promise of God, [Gen
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015.md),

and will keep me in this way that I go; as he had said he would, and as
hitherto he had, and for the future he had reason to believe he still
would:

and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on; which is included
in that clause, "I will not leave thee", &c. [Gen
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015.md), even not without food and
raiment; which is all men can desire or use, and therefore with them
should be content.

So that I come again to my father's house in peace,.... In safety from
Esau, and all other enemies, as God promised him he should:

then the Lord shall be my God; not as if he should not be his God if he
did not do all this for him; which would savour not only of a mercenary
spirit, but of great impiety; neither of which were to be found in
Jacob: but the meaning is, that he should not only continue to own him
as his God, and to worship him, but having fresh obligations upon him,
should be stirred up more eagerly and devoutly to serve him in a very
singular way and manner, and particularly by doing what is expressed in
[Gen 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022.md). Some think he has respect
to the Messiah, owning him to be the true God with the Father and the
blessed Spirit, who had appeared to Abraham, and was the fear of Isaac,
and whom Jacob now owned as his God: this receives some confirmation
from the Targum of Jonathan, which begins the paragraph thus,"if the
Word of the Lord will be my help, &c. then the Lord shall be my God.''

And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house,....
Building an altar of it with some others, and sacrificing to God on it;
and wherever God is worshipped, that place is his house, be it what or
where it will; and Jacob did as he promised to do, see [Gen
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#003.md),

and of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth unto
thee; for the support of his worship; for the maintenance of such that
were employed in it; for the provision of sacrifice, and for the relief
of the poor, or for any use or service in which God might be glorified:
this was imitated by the Heathens in later times, who gave the tenth of
their substance to their gods, Jupiter, Hercules, and others (w).
