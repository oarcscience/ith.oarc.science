INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 21

Excepting the three last verses, is contained in [Sa2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001) with some few variations, which
are there observed; see the notes there.

[1 Chronicles 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 21:28</span></span>

At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the
threshing floor Of Ornan the Jebusite,.... The same with Araunah, [Sa2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016), with some small variation of
the letters, and are of the same signification; both signifying the
"ornus", as Hillerus (m) observes, the pine tree or ash; see [Isa
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#014), in whose threshingfloor David
now was, and where he had been praying and sacrificing; and God had
accepted his prayer, as the Targum, and had answered him, by causing
fire to come down on the sacrifice and consume it, and by ordering the
angel to put up his sword in its sheath:

then he sacrificed there; again by the priests, and continued to do so,
for he had sacrificed there before, [Ch1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026) and finding his sacrifices in
that place were acceptable, he repeated them, and did not go to Gibeon,
as follows.

\(m\) Onomastic. Sacr. p. 529, 530.

[1 Chronicles 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 21:29</span></span>

For the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made,.... Or ordered to be
made by the command of God, and according to his direction:

and the altar of burnt offerings, were at that season in the high place
at Gibeon; which was four or five miles from Jerusalem, and too far for
David to go in that time of extremity; though he must have gone thither
to sacrifice, had not the Lord bid him build an altar on the
threshingfloor; for there was the altar of burnt offering, on which
only, according to the law of Moses, sacrifices were to be offered: this
high place is, in the Targum, called the sanctuary, it including, as
Kimchi observes, the whole house, the tabernacle, and the altar in it;
which had been here, and at Nob, fifty seven years, as the Jewish
writers say (n).

\(n\) Maimon. & Bartenora in Misn. Zebachim, c. 14. sect. 7.

[1 Chronicles 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 21:30</span></span>

But David could not go before it to inquire of God,.... Which yet was
the proper place to seek the Lord in: the reason follows:

for he was afraid, because of the sword of the angel of the Lord; which
had so terrified him, that he was so weak that he could not go; and he
feared that, should he attempt to go, while he was going thither, at
such a distance, the angel would make a terrible slaughter in Jerusalem,
and therefore he durst not go and leave it; and besides, as the Lord had
commanded him to build an altar there, he might fear it would displease
him, should he depart from it; and the rather, as hereby he pointed out
to him the place where the temple should be built, and sacrifices
offered, as appears from what he says in the beginning of the next
chapter.
