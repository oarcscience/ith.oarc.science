[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 11:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 2 CHRONICLES 11

In this chapter are related the preparations Rehoboam made to regain the
ten tribes that revolted from him, but was forbid making the attempt by
a prophet of the Lord, which he paid a regard unto, [Ch2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001.md), the fortification of several
cities in Judah and Benjamin for his defence, [Ch2
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#005.md), the resort of several priests
and Levites to him from Jeroboam, which served to strengthen his
kingdom, [Ch2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013.md), and an account of
his wives, and of his children, and of his disposal of them, [Ch2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#018.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 11:1</span></span>

And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem,.... After he had been at
Shechem, and had given his answer to the request of the men of Israel,
upon which they revolted from him: this and the three following verses
are the same with [Kg1 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021.md). See Gill
on [Kg1 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 11:5</span></span>

And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem,.... The metropolis of Judah, and the
capital city of his kingdom:

and built cities for defence in Judah; that is, rebuilt, enlarged, and
fortified them; for otherwise they were built before, though neglected
before the revolt of the ten tribes; but now it became necessary to make
them more capacious and strong, to protect his people, and defend
himself against Israel; for though he was forbid to act offensively, and
therefore contented himself to abide in Jerusalem, and not go forth to
war; yet he might lawfully put himself into a condition of defence.

[2 Chronicles 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 11:6</span></span>

He built even Bethlehem,.... The place of our Lord's birth, about six
miles from Jerusalem:

and Etam; another city in the tribe of Judah; see [Ch1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#032.md), there was a rock of this name,
[Jdg 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#008.md) and a fountain from whence
waters were conveyed into the pool at Jerusalem, spoken of in Jewish
writings (b):

and Tekoah; of which place Amos the prophet was, and which was about
twelve miles from Jerusalem. Rauwolff (c) speaks of it as a fortified
place now; he says it has a strong and mighty castle, built on a great
and high hill.

\(b\) Cippi Heb. p. 10. (c) Travels, par. 3. c. 22. p. 321. Ed. Ray.

[2 Chronicles 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 11:7</span></span>

And Bethzur, and Shocho, and Adullam. All in the tribe of Judah, of
which see [Jos 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 11:8</span></span>

And Gath,.... Which cannot be that Gath which was one of the
principalities of the Philistines, but a city in the tribe of Judah;
though of it we nowhere else read; unless this is the same with
Moreshethgath, [Mic 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014.md), which is
probable, since it follows:

and Mareshah; the birth place of Micah the prophet, [Mic
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md),

and Ziph; there were two cities of this name in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 11:9</span></span>

And Adoraim,.... Called by Josephus (d) Adora, which he mentions along
with Mareshah, or Marissa:

and Lachish: a royal city in the time of the Canaanites, and which fell
to the lot of Judah, [Jos 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#011.md),

and Azekah; a city situated in the plain of Judah, [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md).

\(d\) Antiqu. l. 13. c. 9. sect. 1.

[2 Chronicles 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 11:10</span></span>

And Zorah,.... The same with Zoreah, [Jos
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033.md),

and Aijalon; there was a city of the tribe of Dan of this name, in the
valley of which the moon stood still in the times of Joshua, [Jos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md), but whether the same with this,
and now belonging to Judah, or another of the same name, is not certain:

and Hebron; a city in the mountainous part of Judah, and a city of
refuge, about twenty miles from Jerusalem, [Jos
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#054.md),

which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities; as they were now made
by Rehoboam.

[2 Chronicles 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 11:11</span></span>

And he fortified the strong holds,.... Of these and other cities:

and put captains in them; garrisons of soldiers, with captains over them
to defend them:

and store of victual, and of oil and wine; that they might be able to
hold out a siege, should they be attacked.

[2 Chronicles 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 11:12</span></span>

And in every several city he put shields and spears,.... Furnished them
with these and perhaps other pieces of armour, these being put for all,
to defend themselves with against an enemy, and to annoy them:

and made them exceeding strong; so that they could not be easily taken:

having Judah and Benjamin on his side: which tribes cleaved to one
another, and to Rehoboam, and to the kings of the house of David, in
later times, as well as to the true religion.

[2 Chronicles 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 11:13</span></span>

And the priests and the Levites, that were in all Israel,.... In the ten
tribes, in the cities assigned to them therein:

resorted to him out of all their coasts; as to their rightful sovereign,
and chiefly for the sake of the service of the sanctuary at Jerusalem.

[2 Chronicles 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 11:14</span></span>

For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession,.... The cities
and the fields adjacent to them, which were given them in the several
tribes, and were in all forty eight; see [Jos
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001.md) and came to Judah and Jerusalem;
to the cities of Judah, which belonged to the Levites; and to Jerusalem,
where they exercised their functions:

for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from exercising the priest's
office unto the Lord; neither suffering them to go to Jerusalem in their
courses, as they used to do by turns, nor to perform their office in
their own dwellings, according to the law of God, in teaching and
instructing the people.

[2 Chronicles 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 11:15</span></span>

And he ordained him priests for the high places,.... Of such who were
not of the tribe of Levi, and family of Aaron; see [Kg1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031.md).

and for the devils; demons in the shape of goats, as this word
signifies, in which form many of the Heathen deities were worshipped;
idols of whatsoever kind are so called; for whosoever worships them
worships not God, but devils, [Co1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021.md) the images which Jeroboam set up
may be meant, and the next clause may be rendered as explanative of
them:

even for the calves which he had made; one of which he set up at Dan,
and the other at Bethel, [Kg1 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 11:16</span></span>

And after them out of all the tribes of Israel,.... Besides the priests
and Levites, and after their example, many of the common people, out of
all the ten tribes:

such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel; to seek his
face and favour, where he was to be found; to worship him according to
his revealed will, and to receive doctrine or instruction from him, as
the Targum:

came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the Lord God of their fathers; to
sacrifice where only sacrifices were to be offered up, and by the
priests of the Lord, who were gone thither, and to their fathers' God,
whom the ten tribes had revolted from.

[2 Chronicles 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 11:17</span></span>

So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah,.... Made it more numerous,
and in a better condition to defend itself:

and made Rehoboam son of Solomon strong three years; established him on
the throne, strengthened the government in his hands, and were the means
of preserving him in the pure worship of God for the space of time
mentioned, the reason of which follows:

for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon; in their
good ways, which were according to the rule of the divine word; and
which, as they refer to the whole of David's life and reign, some
particular actions excepted, so to the former part of Solomon's reign,
before he fell into idolatry, and to the latter part of it after his
repentance; for that he did repent is by some concluded from hence, and
may be more strongly from the book of Ecclesiastes, written by him in
his old age. This is to be understood both of Rehoboam and his people,
who after three years forsook the law of the Lord, [Ch2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 11:18</span></span>

And Rehoboam took him Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, the son of
David, to wife,.... Of which son of David we nowhere else read; perhaps
he might be the son of one of his concubines, or he might have two
names:

and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse; who was David's
eldest brother. [Sa1 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#013.md). She must
be a granddaughter or great-granddaughter of his.

[2 Chronicles 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 11:19</span></span>

Which bare him children,.... Or, "and she bore him" (d); for it is said
only of one of them, the other perhaps died without children; this may
refer to the last mentioned, Abihail, whose children were

Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham; who perhaps all died in their father's
lifetime, since the firstborn of a later wife succeeded him.

[2 Chronicles 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 11:20</span></span>

And after he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom,.... Thought by some to
be Absalom the son of David, his father's brother, and his uncle, and so
married his cousin; but Absalom seems to have had but one daughter,
whose name was Tamar, [Sa2 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#027.md), and
the name of this man is different from his; he is called Abishalom, [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002.md).

and Uriel of Gibeah; [Ch2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002.md), of the
tribe of Benjamin, whereas Absalom was of the tribe of Judah:

which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith: Abijah the
firstborn, and who was successor in the kingdom, is the same with
Abijam, [Kg1 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#031.md) of the rest we
nowhere else read.

[2 Chronicles 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 11:21</span></span>

And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives
and his concubines, &c. Who is called Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel,
[Ch2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002.md),

for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines; led thereunto by the
example of his father Solomon, contrary to the command of God, [Deu
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017.md).

and begat twenty eight sons and sixty daughters; to have many children
was reckoned a great blessing, but it was not honourable to have them in
such a way.

[2 Chronicles 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 11:22</span></span>

And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maacah the chief,.... The chief of
all his sons, head over them, being the son of his most beloved wife,
and her firstborn however, and perhaps might be of a greater capacity
than the rest of his children:

to be ruler among his brethren; or over them; gave him greater
authority, and intrusted him with more power, set him above them, and
treated him as heir apparent to the crown: for he thought

to make him king; either to take him into partnership in the throne with
him in his lifetime, or to appoint and declare him to be his successor.

[2 Chronicles 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 11:23</span></span>

And he dealt wisely,.... Acted a prudent part, in order to execute his
scheme, and particularly by disposing of his other sons in different
parts of his kingdom, as follows: or "he made him his son Abijah to
understand" (e); he taught and instructed him in the art of government,
took a particular care of his education, that he might be fitted for it;
and he might instruct him how to behave towards his brethren, for the
present and hereafter, as well as towards all the people in general: or
"he (Abijah) understood" (f); had more understanding and wisdom than all
the children of Rehoboam; though it seems best to interpret it of
Rehoboam himself, since it follows:

and disposed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah
and Benjamin, unto every fenced city; to be governors thereof, in whose
hands he could better trust them than in any other; or else, by thus
separating them, they would not be able to enter into combination
against Abijah; but then he must at the same time appoint some persons
to watch and observe them; or otherwise, having such, strong places in
their possession, they might rebel against him; the Targum is,"he built
and repaired the cities, and appointed of all his children throughout
all the countries of the house of Judah, to all the fortified
cities;''that is, to have the command of them:

and he gave them victual in abundance; that they might have no reason to
complain, and might be able to hold out a siege against an enemy, should
they be attacked:

and he desired many wives; either for himself, or rather for his son,
since he himself had many; or "Abijah desired, or asked (g) many wives"
of their parents, or of those who had the dispose of them, in imitation
of his father.
