INTRODUCTION TO FIRST SAMUEL 26

This chapter relates that Saul, upon the information of the Ziphites,
went out again with an armed force to seek David, [Sa1
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md); of which David having
intelligence, and of the place where he pitched, came with one of his
men and reconnoitred his camp, and finding Saul and his men asleep, took
away his spear, and the cruse of water at his head, and departed,
without taking away his life, though solicited to it by his servant,
[Sa1 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#004.md); which spear and cruse of
water he produced to the reproach of Abner, Saul's general, and as a
testimony of his sincere regard to Saul, and that he had no design upon
his life, [Sa1 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#013.md); of which Saul
being convinced, blessed David, and returned home again, [Sa1
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 26:1</span></span>

And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah,.... Of Benjamin, called
sometimes Gibeah of Saul, because it was the place of his birth and
residence; hither Saul had returned after his last interview with David;
whether, notwithstanding what had passed between him and David, he had
privately encouraged the Ziphites to watch David, and give him
information of him where he was, and when it was a proper opportunity to
seize him; or whether the Ziphites were so officious as of themselves to
acquaint him with it, is not certain; the latter is probable, since
having attempted to betray David, they might fear, that should he come
to the throne, he would remember it, and therefore they might be
desirous of having him cut off by the hand of Saul:

saying, doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is
before Jeshimon? the same place where he was when the Ziphites before
gave information of him, [Sa1 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#010.md);
here he might choose to be, supposing that the Ziphites now would not
meditate anything against him, since Saul had declared he would be king
after him, and had made him swear that he would not cut off his
posterity; and as he thought it his wisdom to provide against the worst,
knowing the inconstancy of Saul, he might judge this the most proper
place of safety, and from whence he could, on occasion, easily retreat
into the wilderness; and it may be also, because it was near to
Abigail's estate and possessions, which were now a good resource for
him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 26:2</span></span>

Then Saul arose,.... Immediately, glad of an opportunity to seize on
David, having the same disposition towards him as ever; and perhaps had
repented he had not laid hold on him when he followed him out of the
cave:

and went down to the wilderness of Ziph: or towards it:

having three thousand chosen men of Israel; young men, so called,
because usually chosen for business, and for war particularly, rather
than old men; the same number he took with him when he sought him at
Engedi, [Sa1 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#002.md),

to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph; where or whereabouts he was
informed by the Ziphites he was.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 26:3</span></span>

And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by
the way,.... To the wilderness; the very same place where the Ziphites
suggested David was:

but David abode in the wilderness; not in the hill of Hachilah, but in
the wilderness of Ziph itself:

and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness; he understood,
by some information he had, that Saul had set out from Gibeah, and was
coming to seek for him in the wilderness of Ziph; perhaps Jonathan had
given him intelligence; however, he was not quite certain, as appears by
what follows.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 26:4</span></span>

David therefore sent out spies,.... To observe if he was coming or come,
and where he was, that he might not be surprised by him; for though
David knew the Lord was and would be his protection, he thought proper
to be upon his guard, and to make use of means for his safety:

and understood that Saul was come in very deed; that he was most
certainly come, and come to some certain place; which he himself went to
reconnoitre, as in [Sa1 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#005.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 26:5</span></span>

And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched,.... Came
near it, within sight of it; so that he could take a view of it with his
naked eye, and observe where and in what manner he was encamped:

and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,

the captain of his host; where he and his general had their quarters in
the camp:

and Saul lay in the trench; or circuit; not in the foss or ditch thrown
up, in which an army sometimes lies entrenched; but this is to be
understood either of the camp itself, so called, as Ben Gersom,
Abarbinel, and Ben Melech think, because it lay in a circular form, that
all comers to it on every side might be seen; or else a sort of fortress
all around the camp, made of carriages joined together; and as the word
signifies a carriage, cart or chariot, it may design the chariot in
which Saul slept, as kings have been used to do when not in their
houses; and to this the Septuagint agrees, which uses a word that
Procopius Gazaeus says signifies one kind of a chariot, and is used of a
chariot drawn by mules, in the Greek version of [Isa
66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md); Grotius observes, kings used to
sleep in chariots where there were no houses; See Gill on [Sa1
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#020.md); though he rather seems to have
slept, "sub die", in the open air:

and the people pitched round about him; both for the sake of honour, and
for his greater security; this shows it could not be the loss he laid
in, for then they could not pitch around him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 26:6</span></span>

Then answered David,.... Or addressed himself to the two following
persons:

and said to Ahimelech the Hittite; who was either an Hittite by birth,
but was become a proselyte, or he was an Israelite that had dwelt among
the Hittites, and so had this name given him; the former seems most
probable; some say (k) this was Uriah the Hittite:

and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab; Zeruiah was the
sister of David, [Ch1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#015.md); and these
were two sons of hers, who very probably joined David at the cave of
Adullam, [Sa1 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md),

saying, who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? that is, which of
you two?

and Abishai said, I will go down with thee; the other being timorous, or
Abishai being most forward spoke first.

\(k\) Hieron. Trad. Heb. in lib. Reg. fol. 76. M.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 26:7</span></span>

So David and Abishai came to the people by night,.... Josephus (l)
wrongly says, that he took with him both Abishai and Ahimelech; he chose
to have but one, for the greater secrecy. This was a bold enterprise,
for two men to go into a camp of three thousand men, though it was in
the night; when though they might suppose the greater part of them were
asleep, yet they could not well suppose this of all, and especially of
the guards or sentinels; but no doubt David was moved to this, not
merely by the dint of his natural courage, but by the Spirit of God, by
whom he might be assured of protection, and that Saul and the people
were cast into a deep sleep by the Lord, as they were, [Sa1
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#012.md); and this the Lord moved him to,
that he might have an opportunity a second time to convince Saul of his
innocence, and that he had no design upon his life:

and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench; See Gill on [Sa1
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#005.md),

and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster; ready to take up and
defend himself, should he be surprised; or this was his sceptre, which
he always carried about with him, as an ensign of royalty, and by which
very probably David knew which was Saul's tent or couch, where he slept:

but Abner and the people lay round about him; as in [Sa1
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#005.md).

\(l\) Antiqu. l. 6. c. 13. sect. 9.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 26:8</span></span>

Then said Abishai to David,.... Seeing Saul fast asleep, and a spear so
near him:

God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: or at this
time, properly it was night:

now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear; with Saul's
own spear, which was stuck in the ground at his bolster. He remembered
that David would not put forth his hand to stay him before, when he had
an opportunity; and since now another offered, he did not move it to him
to do it, but begged leave to do it himself; which he might think would
be granted, since there was such a remarkable hand of Providence in it,
which seemed to direct to such a step:

even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time;
signifying, that he would give such a home blow or thrust, that the
spear should pierce through him, and fasten him to the ground, that
there would be no need to repeat it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 26:9</span></span>

And David said to Abishai, destroy him not,.... He laid his commands
upon him not to hurt him:

for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed, and be
guiltless? since Saul was king, and appointed to that office by the
Lord, and was anointed by his order for it, and invested with it by him,
his person was sacred, and not to be touched; nor could his life be
taken away by any without being guilty of a very great crime indeed,
which it might be justly expected the Lord would resent and punish.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 26:10</span></span>

And David said furthermore,.... In order to make Abishai easy, and
prevent his doing what he proposed:

as the Lord liveth; which was the form of an oath, made to assure
Abishai of the truth of what follows, and therefore he need not be hasty
to put Saul to death, since it would not be long before he should die,
in one or other of the three following ways: either

the Lord shall smite him; suddenly, which the Jews call cutting off, or
death by the hand of heaven, by the immediate hand of God:

or his day shall come to die; the time appointed for him to die a
natural death, of some disease common to men:

or he shall descend into battle, and perish; which was commonly reckoned
death, casual or accidental, and in which last way Saul did die, [Sa1
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#003.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 26:11</span></span>

The Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord's
anointed,.... Or suffer any about him to do it; he speaks of it with the
utmost detestation and abhorrence:

but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster; not to
smite him with, as he desired, but to carry off, and was no other than
his sceptre; See Gill on [Sa1 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#033.md),

and the cruse of water; which stood in the same place, as appears by
[Sa1 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#012.md). Some take this to be a pot
to make water in; others an hourglass, to know the time of night, in
which not sand, but water, flowed for that purpose: but rather this was
for his refreshment should he be hot and thirsty in the night, or to
purify him from any nocturnal pollution that might happen; for,
according to Clemens of Alexandria (m), it was a custom of the Jews
often to purify themselves in bed: though Fortunatus Scacchus (n) thinks
Saul had this pot or cup for a religious use; which he had with him, and
with it gave thanks to God, the author of all good, whenever he sat down
to a meal; such as the golden cup Philip king of Macedon always had
under his pillow when he slept (o):

and let us go; and do nothing more; which would be sufficient to
convince they had been there, and to show what was in their power to do,
had they been so inclined.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 26:12</span></span>

So David took the spear, and the cruse of water, from Saul's
bolster,.... Abishai either refusing to take them, since he might not
take away his life; or it may be rather David thought better of it, and
took them himself, lest Abishai should be tempted, when so near to Saul,
and his spear in his hand, and should thrust him with it; though David
may be said to take them by the hands of Abishai:

and they gat them away; with the above things along with them:

and no man saw it, nor knew it; saw them in the camp, or knew what they
did:

neither awaked; at their talking together, at the motion of their feet,
and taking away the spear and cruse:

for they were all asleep; which was very extraordinary, that among three
thousand men none should be awake, not even the sentinels; which might
seem impossible in a natural way, but it is accounted for by what
follows:

because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them; or "a sleep of
the Lord" (p); a very great one, an uncommon one; so great trees,
mountains, &c. are called trees and mountains of God; or, according to
our supplement, it was from the Lord, he was the cause and author of it;
he cast them into this sleep, or caused it to fall upon them, and locked
them up in it, that they might not hear David and his servant when they
came among them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 26:13</span></span>

Then David went over to the other side,.... To a hill on the other side,
opposite to Hachilah, where Saul lay encamped; or "passed over the
passage" (q), the valley that lay between the two hills, and perhaps
passed over a brook that ran in the valley, which is not unusual; so
Josephus (r) says, that he went over a brook and came to the top of a
mountain:

and stood on the top of an hill afar off; he chose the top of an hill,
that his voice might be heard at a distance, as it might in a clear air,
and still night; and to be afar off, that he might the better make his
escape, should an attempt be made to pursue him:

a great space being between them; a large valley lying between the two
hills.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 26:14</span></span>

And David cried unto the people,.... To the army of Saul with a loud
voice, that he might be heard:

and to Abner the son of Ner; particularly to him, because he was general
of the army:

saying, answerest thou not, Abner? it seems he had called to him more
than once, and he had returned no answer; perhaps not being thoroughly
awake, or not knowing whose voice it was, and from whence it came:

then Abner answered and said, who art thou that criest to the king? but
it does not appear that David called to the king, only to the people,
and to Abner their general, and therefore may be better rendered, "by
the king" (s); that is, near him, or "before him" (t), in his presence.
Kimchi and Ben Melech explain it, upon the king, or over him; and the
Targum is, at the head of the king; the meaning is, how he could act
such a part as to call so loud within the king's hearing, as to disturb
the king's rest, and awake him out of his sleep.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 26:15</span></span>

And David said to Abner, art not thou a valiant man?.... Or a man (u), a
man of great fame for courage and valour, a man of great authority, who
had the next post in the army under Saul, but had not behaved like a
man, worthy of his character and office:

and who is like to thee in Israel? none that bare so great a name, or
was in so high an office, who therefore should have been careful to have
acted according to both:

wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? took care to have
set a guard about his person while he slept; which perhaps was neglected
through a contempt of David and his men, as being in no fear of them:

for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord; that
is, there had been one in the camp that night, who had entered there
with that view to have destroyed him, had he an opportunity, and which
did offer; this was true of Abishai, who no doubt went down with David
into the camp with that intent, though David did not, and therefore he
says, "one of the people", not more; for though two went in, only one
with that view: David observes to them the danger the king was in, his
carefulness of him to preserve his life, to whom only it was owing, and
the negligence of Abner, and those under his command.

\(u\) "vir", V. L. Pagninus, Montanus, Tigurine version, Piscator.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 26:16</span></span>

This thing is not good that thou hast done,.... Yea, it was very bad, a
great fault, and very blameworthy, if he had neglected to set a watch
over the king, whose business it was as a general; the words are
expressed in a figure called "meiosis", in which less is said than was
intended:

as the Lord liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your
master, the Lord's anointed; if a watch was set, and these had fallen
asleep, and neglected their duty, or had deserted their post; which to
do was a capital crime, and deserving of death; wherefore he does not
say this of Abner, but of the watch:

and now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was
at his bolster; which he then held up as proofs and evidences of the
truth of what be said, that one had been in the camp and had carried off
these, and who could as easily have destroyed the king as to have taken
these away; and as he came hither with an intent to destroy him, would
have done it, had he not been prevented by David; all which likewise
plainly proved the negligence of Abner, in not setting a watch about his
master, or the negligence of the watch that was set.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 26:17</span></span>

And Saul knew David's voice,.... Though Abner at first did not, as
appears by his words, but Saul did, by being this time thoroughly awake
through the discourse that passed between David and Abner:

and said, is this thy voice, my son David? the same question he put
before, when he followed him out of the cave; see Gill on [Sa1
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016.md),

and David said, it is my voice, my lord, O king; he not only owns him to
be king, whom he sought not to depose, but his own liege lord and
sovereign, whose commands he was ready to obey.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 26:18</span></span>

And he said, wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?....
Suggesting that it was both below him to do it, and against his
interest; for David was his servant, and he would gladly have continued
in his service, and done his business, but he drove him from it, and
pursued him as a traitor, when he had not been guilty of any offence to
his knowledge: and therefore puts the following questions:

for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand? what crime had he
committed, that he was pursued after this manner, and his life sought
for? what had he done worthy of death? having a clear conscience, he
could boldly ask these questions.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 26:19</span></span>

Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his
servant,.... Whether David waited for an answer to his question is not
certain; probably he did, and observing none returned, desired audience
of what he had further to say:

if the Lord have stirred thee up against me; if he had put it into his
heart to persecute him after this manner, for some sin he had committed
against him, though not against Saul: did that appear to be the case:

let him accept an offering; my offering, as the Targum; or my prayer, as
Jarchi; I would offer a sin offering according to the law, to make
atonement for my offence, and might hope it would be accepted; or I
would make my supplication to God, and entreat him to forgive mine
iniquity, and so an issue be put to these troubles; or should it be a
capital crime deserving of death he was guilty of, he was content to
die, and satisfy for his fault in that way; or if both of them had
sinned, in any respect, he proposed to join in an acceptable sacrifice
to God, and so reconciliation be made, and matters adjusted in such a
religious way; if it was the evil spirit from the Lord that had entered
into Saul, or God had suffered a melancholy disorder to seize him, which
had put him upon those measures, let an offering agreeable to the will
of God be offered, or supplication made for the removal of it:

but if they be the children of men; that incited him to such violent
methods, as Abner his general, or Doeg the Edomite, and others:

cursed be they before the Lord; an imprecation of the vengeance of God
upon them:

for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of
the Lord; meaning not from his own house and fatally, nor from the
palace of Saul, but from the land of Canaan the Lord had given to his
people Israel for an inheritance, and from the worship of God in it,
which made it dear and precious to him; he knew if Saul went on pursuing
him in this manner, he mast be obliged to quit the land, and go into a
foreign country, as he quickly did; so the Targum renders it the
inheritance of the people of the Lord: by being driven out of the land
which was their inheritance, he should be deprived of their company and
conversation, and of all social worship; the consideration of which was
cutting to him, and caused the above imprecation from him on those who
were concerned in it, and who in effect by their actions were

saying, go, serve other gods; for by being forced to go into an
idolatrous country, he would be in the way of temptation, and be liable
to be corrupted by ill examples, and to be persuaded and enticed into
idolatrous practices; and if he was kept from them it would be no thanks
to them, they did all they could to lead him into them; and if he was
preserved, it would be owing to the power and grace of God; the Targum
is,"go David among the people that worship idols;''the Jews have a
saying, that he that dwells without the land of Israel, it is as if he
had no God and as if he served an idol (q).

\(q\) T. Bab. Cetubot, fol. 110. 2.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 26:20</span></span>

Now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the
Lord,.... For should it be spilled, God, who is omniscient, will see it,
and take notice of it; and being righteous, and to whom vengeance
belongs, he will avenge it: some render it, "my blood shall not fall to
the earth before the face of the Lord" (r); I am continually under his
eye and care, and he will protect and defend me; and in vain is it for
thee to pursue after me; I shall never fall into thine hands, though I
may be obliged to quit my country, and go into an idolatrous nation,
against my will:

for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea; which leaps from
place to place and is not easily taken: or this may denote what a mean,
poor, weak, insignificant person David was; and how much it was below
Saul to come out with an army of chosen men in pursuit of him; so the
Targum,"the king of Israel is come out to seek one that is weak or
feeble:"

as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains; as kings for their
delight used to do, as Abarbinel observes; but this being a business of
pleasure, and this a bird of worth, some other is thought to be here
intended. Indeed the is represented as worth no more than an "obolus",
or five farthings, though fifty drachmas or drachms were ordered to be
paid for one (s); the Septuagint renders the word an "owl": the word is
"kore", and from the etymology of it one would think it was the raven or
crow. Jarchi on [Jer 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011.md) takes it to
be the cuckoo, though here the partridge as others; Bochart (t) will
have it to be the woodcock, snipe, or snite (u). Some choose to read the
words,"as the kore or partridge on the mountains hunts;''which, it is
said, hunts and seeks after the nests of other birds, and sits on their
eggs (v): see [Jer 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011.md); so Saul
hunted after David, though he could not take him; several naturalists
(w) observe, that the partridge is very difficult to be taken by the
hunter.

Then said Saul, I have sinned,.... Which is more than he acknowledged
before, and yet, it is to be feared he had no true sense of his sin, and
real repentance for it; but, like Pharaoh, his guilty conscience for the
present forced this confession from him; see [Exo
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027.md),

return, my son David: meaning to his own house, or rather to his palace,
since he had disposed of his wife to another man:

for I will no more do thee harm: or seek to do it by pursuing him from
place to place, as he had done, which had given him a great deal of
trouble and fatigue:

because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day; and therefore
spared, when he could have taken it away; which showed that his life was
dear to him, of great worth and value in his account; and therefore he
would neither take it away himself, nor suffer another to do it:

behold, I have played the fool, and erred exceedingly: in seeking after
his life, and pursuing him again, when he had such a convincing proof of
his sincerity and faithfulness, and of his cordial affection for him,
when he only cut off the skirts of his garment in the cave, and spared
his life.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 26:22</span></span>

And David answered and said, behold the king's spear!.... And which
perhaps was his sceptre, and which David therefore would not keep, lest
it should be thought or said that he had deprived him of an ensign of
his royalty, and be interpreted as a token of his design to seize his
crown and throne:

and let one of the young men come over and fetch it; for notwithstanding
the acknowledgment Saul had made of his sin and folly, David did not
choose to carry the spear to him; not caring to trust him, and put
himself into his hands, lest the evil spirit should return and come upon
him suddenly, and alter his disposition and carriage; nor would he send
any of his men with it, whose lives were dear to him, lest they should
be seized as traitors, but desires one of Saul's men might be sent for
it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 26:23</span></span>

The Lord render to every man his righteousness, and his
faithfulness,.... Or recompense every man that deals justly and
faithfully with others, as he had done with Saul; or the Lord, who is
just and faithful to his promises, reward the men that act the good and
upright part; and this was a prayer of faith; for David doubted not
that, though Saul might fail, yet God could not:

for the Lord delivered thee into my hand this day; or, "into an hand"
(x) into the hand of Abishai, who had it in his power to slay him, when
he went and took the spear that was at his bolster, and would have done
it, but David suffered him not:

but I would not stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed; nor
suffer another to stretch forth his hand against him; so careful and
tender was he of his life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 26:24</span></span>

And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,.... Or
"magnified" (y); and made great account of, as being the life of the
king of Israel, and the Lord's anointed, and so spared:

so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord; he does not say
in the eyes of Saul, as it should have been by way of retaliation, and
as it might have been expected he would have said; but he had no
dependence on Saul, nor expected justice to be done him by him; but he
prays that his life might be precious in the sight of Lord, and taken
care of, and protected by him, as he believed it would:

and let him deliver me out of all tribulation; for as yet he did not
think himself quite out of it, notwithstanding all that Saul had said,
but believed the Lord would deliver him in due time; from him alone he
looked for it, and on him he depended.

\(y\) "magnificata est", V. L. Pagninus, Montanus.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 26:25</span></span>

Then Saul said to David, blessed be thou, my son David,.... He desired
God to bless him, and pronounced him blessed himself, believing he would
be a happy and prosperous man:

thou shall both do great things; he had done great things already, in
slaying Goliath, obtaining victories over the Philistines, and escaping
the hands of Saul, and keeping out of them with so small a force; and he
should do greater things yet:

and also shalt still prevail; against Saul and all his enemies; the
Targum is,"even in reigning thou shalt reign, and even in prospering
thou shalt prosper;''he believed he would be king, so he had said
before, [Sa1 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#020.md),

so David went on his way: to the wilderness again very probably, putting
no trust and confidence in Saul, knowing how fickle and unstable he was:

and Saul returned to his place; to Gibeah, where his palace was.
