INTRODUCTION TO 2 KINGS 19

This chapter relates that King Hezekiah, on a report made to him of
Rabshakeh's speech, sent a message to the prophet Isaiah to pray for
him, who returned him a comfortable and encouraging answer, [Kg2
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001.md) and that upon Rabshakeh's return
to the king of Assyria, he sent to Hezekiah a terrifying letter, [Kg2
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008.md), which Hezekiah spread before the
Lord, and prayed unto him to save him and his people out of the hands of
the king of Assyria, [Kg2 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#014.md), to
which he had a gracious answer sent him by the prophet Isaiah, promising
him deliverance from the Assyrian army, [Kg2
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020.md), which accordingly was destroyed
by an angel in one night, and Sennacherib fleeing to Nineveh, was slain
by his two sons, [Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 19:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it,.... The report of
Rabshakeh's speech, recorded in the preceding chapter:

that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth; rent his
clothes because of the blasphemy in the speech; and he put on sackcloth,
in token of mourning, for the calamities he feared were coming on him
and his people: and he went into the house of the Lord; the temple, to
pray unto him. The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the
threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it,
and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the
destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the
same "verbatim" as in [Isa 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001.md)
throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the
exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that
still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein
they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close
by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against
old Bethel.
