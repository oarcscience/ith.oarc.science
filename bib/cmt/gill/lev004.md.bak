### [Leviticus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO LEVITICUS 4

This chapter contains the law of the sin offering, which was offered for
sins committed through ignorance, error, and mistake, [Lev
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001.md) and gives an account of the matter
of them, and the rites belonging thereunto, which were different
according to the persons for whom it was made, as for the anointed
priest, [Lev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md) for the whole
congregation, [Lev 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md) and for the
ruler, [Lev 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md) and for any of the
common people, [Lev 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027.md).

[Leviticus 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 4:1</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying. Continued to speak to him, or,
after some pause made, proceeded to speak to him, and give things in
commandment concerning the sin offering, what it should be, and for
whom, as follows.

[Leviticus 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 4:2</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel, saying,.... For this law concerning
the sin offering, as the rest, only belonged to them, and such as were
proselyted to them:

if a soul should sin through ignorance; sin is from the soul, though
committed by the body; it is the soul that sins, [Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004.md) it includes, as Aben Ezra
observes, both Israelites and proselytes; who sinned through ignorance
either of the law, that such things were forbidden, or of having
committed them, they being done unobserved, and through inadvertency; or
were forgotten that they were done, or were done through error and
mistake; these sins are what the apostle calls the errors of the people,
their strayings out of the way through ignorance and inadvertency, [Heb
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002.md) such sins as a man is overtaken
with unawares, and is drawn into at once through temptation and the
prevalence of corruption; these are the errors and secret faults which
David distinguishes from presumptuous sins, [Psa
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012.md),

against any of the commandments of the Lord (concerning things which
ought not to be done.) The Jewish writers (m) distinguish the
commandments of the Lord into affirmative and negative, and make their
number to be six hundred and thirteen; two hundred and forty eight are
affirmative, according to the number of bones in a man's body, and three
hundred sixty five are negative ones, according to the number of the
days of the year; and they observe (n), it is only the transgression of
negative precepts that is here meant, and for which a sin offering was
to be brought:

and shall do against any of them; it must be something done, and not
merely said: hence the Jews (o) say, that as the neglect of
circumcision, and of the passover, does not come under this law, because
they are affirmative precepts; so neither blasphemy, because there is
nothing done, only something said: of these sins of ignorance, they give
instances as follows; if any man eats the fat that is about the kidneys,
thinking it is the fat that is about the heart; or that lies with a
woman forbidden by the law, thinking her to be his wife; or that commits
idolatry, by bowing to the idol, thinking that the law forbids
sacrifice, incense, and libation, but not bowing; or that profanes the
sabbath, thinking it is a common day (p).

[Leviticus 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 4:3</span></span>

If the priest that is anointed do sin,.... That is, the high priest, as
the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, and the Septuagint version, render
it; who in after times was only anointed, though at first Aaron's sons
were anointed with him; so an high priest is described in [Lev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010.md) and such an one was liable to
sin, and often did; which shows not only that the greatest and best of
men are not without sin, but proves what the apostle observes, that the
law made men high priests which had infirmity, even sinful infirmities,
who needed to offer for themselves as well as for the people; by which
it appeared that perfection could not be had by the Levitical
priesthood, and that it was proper it should cease, and another
priesthood take place, [Heb 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md),

according to the sin of the people; committing the like sins of error
and ignorance as the common people, to which he was liable as they; or
"to make the people guilty"; as the margin reads; to which agrees the
Septuagint version, "so that the people sin"; and the Vulgate Latin
version, "making the people to sin"; either by his doctrine or example,
and both through ignorance, heedlessness, and inadvertency: the Targum
of Jonathan is,"when he offers the offering of sin for the people, not
according to its manner''or rite; as if his sin lay in erring while he
was offering; but be it in which way it may, whether by any unadvised
inadvertent action of his own, or ignorant instruction of the people, so
causing them to err, or any ignorance or mistake in offering the
sacrifices of the people:

then let him bring for the sin which he has sinned; in either way:

a young bullock; not an ox which was three years old, nor a calf which
was but of one year, but a bullock which was of two years; so Maimonides
(q) observes, that wherever it is said a calf, that is a young one of
the first year, but a bullock it is a young one of the second year: as
are men's characters, so are the aggravations of their sins, and
sacrifices were proportioned thereunto; the high priest was obliged to
bring the same offering as the whole congregation did in a like case;
see [Lev 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md).

without blemish; a type of the sacrifice of Christ offered up without
spot to God, as it follows:

unto the Lord; against whom sin is committed, and therefore sacrifice
both in the type and antitype must be brought and offered up to him, by
whom it is accepted, and to whom it is of a sweetsmelling savour,
namely, the unblemished sacrifice of Christ:

for a sin offering; or "for sin": the sin offering is called sin itself,
and so is Christ the antitype of it, [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md) Christ is most holy in himself,
had no sin in him, nor knew any, nor were any committed by him; yet he
appeared in the likeness of sinful flesh, took the place of sinners, and
was their substitute, had all their sins laid upon him, and was by
imputation made sin itself, and became an offering for it, and so fully
answered the type of the sin offering.

\(q\) Maaseh Hakorbanot, c. 1. sect. 14.

[Leviticus 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 4:4</span></span>

And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation before the Lord,.... As the bullock of the burnt offering;
See Gill on [Lev 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003.md),

and shall lay his hand on the bullock's head; the Targum of Jonathan
says his right hand; See Gill on [Lev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004.md),

and kill the bullock before the Lord; at the door of the tabernacle,
that is, in the court, as Gersom observes; according to the above
Targum, the butcher killed it, and not the priest: See Gill on [Lev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005.md) all this is typical of the
imputation of sin to Christ, and of his death.

[Leviticus 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 4:5</span></span>

And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,....
Let out and received into a basin; this he did himself, and not another,
for he offered for himself, and the blood was to make atonement for him:

and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation; out of the court
where the bullock was slain, into the holy place, where were the vail
that divided between the holy of holies, and the altar of sweet incense,
after mentioned.

[Leviticus 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 4:6</span></span>

And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood,.... The finger of his
right hand, as Gersom observes, and so Maimonides (r); for blood was
always taken and sprinkled with the right hand, if done with the left it
was wrong, according to the Jewish canons (s) and though it is only said
the priest, and not that is anointed, as before, yet it seems to mean
him and not another; though if a private priest did this, Gersom says,
it would be right, and so Maimonides (t):

and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord; a figure of the
blood of Christ, called, in allusion to this rite, the blood of
sprinkling; which being presented before the Lord, calls for pardon from
him, and sprinkled on the conscience, speaks peace there, and perfectly
cleanses from all sin, which the seven times sprinkling is a symbol of:

before the vail of the sanctuary: the words may be literally rendered,
"the face of the vail of the sanctuary": as if the blood was sprinkled
on the outside of the vail. Jarchi's note is,"over against the place of
its holiness, he directed (it) over against between the staves; the
blood shall not touch the vail, but if it touches, it touches it;''that
is, it is no matter. And according to Maimonides (u) the blood of
bullocks and goats burnt was sprinkled seven times upon the vail, which
divided between the and the holy of holies. This typified the vail of
flesh, whose blood gives boldness to enter into the holiest of all, [Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md).

[Leviticus 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 4:7</span></span>

And the priest shall put some of the blood,.... With his finger, which
he dipped into it:

upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is
in the tabernacle of the congregation; this was the golden altar on
which incense was offered: it was placed before the vail, on the outside
of it, in the holy place, see [Exo
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md) and the priest, when he put the
blood on the horns of it, began at the northeast horn, so to the
northwest, then to the southwest, and last to the southeast (w); and the
priest dipped his finger at every horn, and when he had finished at one
horn, he wiped his finger at the edge of the basin, and after that
dipped a second time; for what remained of the blood on his finger was
not fit to put upon another horn (x). This rite shows, that the
intercession of Christ, signified by the altar of sweet incense,
proceeds upon the foot of his blood and sacrifice, [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md) [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md),

and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar
of burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation; this altar stood without the holy place, and the altar of
incense within; and after the priest had sprinkled of the blood of the
bullock, upon the horns of the altar of incense, what remained he poured
at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering; for though it is said
"all" the blood, it can mean no more than what was left; wherefore the
Vulgate Latin version renders it, "all the remaining blood": and
Jarchi's explanatory note is, the rest of the blood. The place where
this was poured, according to Maimonides (y), was the west bottom of the
altar; and Gersom on the place observes the same. This denotes the
efficacy of Christ's blood to make atonement for sin, and the reverent
esteem it ought to be had in, being precious blood.

[Leviticus 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 4:8</span></span>

And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin
offering,.... When the priest had killed the bullock, and sprinkled and
poured the blood, as before commanded; he then cut up the bullock, and
took out its inwards, and put them in a vessel, and salted them, and
strowed them on the fires (z), and burnt them, and the fat of them, as
he did with the sacrifice of the peace offerings; so that what is here
said, and in the two next verses [Lev
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#009.md), is the same with what is ordered
concerning them in [Lev 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003.md); see Gill
on [Lev 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003.md), [Lev
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#004.md), [Lev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#005.md). Jarchi and Gersom both observe
that they agree, that as one brings peace into the world, so does the
other.

[Leviticus 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 4:11</span></span>

And the skin of the bullock,.... Not taken off; for the sin offerings
that were burnt were not flayed at all, but were cut in pieces with
their skins on them (a); in other burnt offerings the skin was taken
off, and was a perquisite of the priest, [Lev
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008.md) but this being an offering for the
priest, the skin was burnt with the rest:

and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards,
and his dung; the burning of these denoted the sufferings of Christ, and
these several parts the extent of them, they reaching to all parts of
his body as stretched upon the cross; and the dung particularly the
reproach of them, he dying the death of the cross, and was made sin and
a curse for his people.

\(a\) Ib. (Maasch Hakoranot) c. 5. sect. 18. & 7. 2.

[Leviticus 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 4:12</span></span>

Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp,.... The
Jewish writers interpret it without the three camps (b), the camp of the
tabernacle, the camp of the Levites, and the camp of the Israelites;
when the temple was built, such sacrifices were carried and burnt
without the city of Jerusalem; there were three places for burning; one
was in the midst of the court, where they burnt such sacrifices as were
unfit and rejected; the other was in the mountain of the house called
Birah, where they burnt such as any accident befell them, after the
carrying of them out of the court; and the third place was without
Jerusalem, called the place of ashes (c): this was typical of Christ
being had out of the city of Jerusalem, and suffering without the gates
of it, [Heb 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011.md),

unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out; the ashes of the
burnt offerings. This, according to Ainsworth, answered to the place
where Christ was crucified, being a place of skulls, or dead men's
ashes, [Joh 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017.md),

and burn him on the wood with fire; any wood might be used for the
burning of it, even straw or stubble, which in the Hebrew language are
called wood, as Gersom on the place observes, and so Maimonides (d); and
it is added, "with fire", as the last writer says (e), to exclude lime
and cinder coals:

where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt; openly without; and
seeing it is not said, that the priest shall carry forth the bullock,
and shall burn it, it is concluded by Gersom on the place, that both may
be done lawfully by a stranger, and so Maimonides (f).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 4:13</span></span>

And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,.... That
is, all Israel, or the greatest part of them, as Gersom interprets it,
through the ignorant teaching of the judges, who by their instruction
cause the people to err, and commit sins of ignorance, as Baal Hatturim
on the place observes, and Maimonides elsewhere (g); wherefore Jarchi,
and some others, by the congregation of Israel understand the sanhedrim,
or the bench of judges, consisting of seventy one. Ainsworth remarks on
the words, that the church may err:

and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly; congregation or
church, so that they do not know that it is a sin which they have
committed:

and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord,
concerning things which should not be done; transgressed negative
precepts:

and are guilty; of sin, though as yet they know it not.

\(g\) Hilchot Shegagot, c. 12. sect. 1.

[Leviticus 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 4:14</span></span>

When the sin which they have sinned against it,.... Any of the
commandments of the Lord forbidding such a thing to be done:

is known; is made known to them by the priest, or any other, so that
they are convinced that what has been done is wrong, though done through
ignorance:

then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring
him before the tabernacle of the congregation; the same offering with
that of the anointed priest, he being, as Aben Ezra on the place
observes, equal to all Israel.

[Leviticus 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 4:15</span></span>

And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head
of the bullock before the Lord,.... These must be two at least, some say
three, and some say five (h); the more generally received notion is,
that they were three of the sanhedrim (i); though the Targum of Jonathan
makes them to be the twelve rulers of the twelve tribes:

and the bullock shall be killed before the Lord; in the court near the
altar of burnt offering, either by a priest, or Levite, or by a butcher,
as the above Targum expresses it.

[Leviticus 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 4:16</span></span>

And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood,....
That is, the chief priest, as the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan
explain it:

to the tabernacle of the congregation; as he brought the blood of his
own bullock, [Lev 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#005.md) from hence to
the [Lev 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#016.md) an account is given of
the same rites to be observed in the sin offering, for the congregation,
as for the anointed priest; See Gill on [Lev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006.md), [Lev
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007.md), [Lev
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012.md).

[Leviticus 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 4:22</span></span>

When a ruler hath sinned,.... Or "prince", the "nasi", one that is
lifted up above others in honour, power, and authority, or that bears
the weight of government: the word comes from one which signifies to
lift up, or to bear; it may be understood of a governor of a family, or
of a tribe, as Aben Ezra observes; and so in the Talmud (k) it is said,
it means the prince of a tribe, such as Nachson the son of Amminadab,
prince of the tribe of Judah. Maimonides (l) says a king is designed,
over whom none has power; and so Gersom on the place, who observes, that
David the king is called a prince, [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md).

and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of
the Lord his God; the phrase, "his God", is here added, and is not used
neither of the anointed priest, nor of the congregation, nor of one of
the common people; only of the prince, to show, that though he is above
others, God is above him, and he is accountable to him; he is his God,
of whom he is, and by whom he rules; wherefore if he breaks any of his
commandments, though ignorantly, he must bring a sacrifice for it:

concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty; of
transgressing negative precepts, which are as binding on him as others.

\(k\) T. Bab. Horayot, fol. 11. 1. (l) Hilchot Shegagot, c. 15. sect. 6.

[Leviticus 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 4:23</span></span>

Or if his sin wherein he hath sinned come to his knowledge,.... Or
rather, "and if his sin", &c. (m) either by means of others informing
him of it, or of himself calling to mind what he has done, and
considering it to be a transgression of the law:

he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish;
his offering was to be a "kid of the goats", a fat and a large one;
because, as Baal Hatturim observes, he ate fat things every day; and to
distinguish it from the offering of one of the common people; and
"without blemish"; as all sacrifices were, that they might be typical of
the offering of Christ without spot.

\(m\) Sept. "et postea", V. L. & Noldius, p. 3. No. 23.

[Leviticus 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 4:24</span></span>

And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat,.... His right hand,
as the Targum of Jonathan; See Gill on [Lev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004.md).

and kill it; not the prince, but the priest after mentioned, or the
butcher, as the same Targum:

in the place where they hill the burnt offering before the Lord; in the
court on the north side of the altar, see [Lev
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#011.md),

it is a sin offering: an offering for his sin of ignorance, or "sin"; so
Christ our offering is said to be, [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md).

[Leviticus 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 4:25</span></span>

And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his
finger,.... With the finger of his right hand, as the Talmudists (n)
observe, and Gersom on the place; the priest first received the blood
into a basin or ministering vessel, and then dipped the finger of his
right hand into it, that next the thumb:

and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering; the four horns
of it; in this there was a difference between the sacrifice of the
anointed priest and of the congregation, and this of the ruler; the
blood of the former was put upon the horns of the altar of incense, this
upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering:

and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt
offering; the South bottom of it; the order of the priest's proceeding
in putting the blood was different from that used in putting it on the
horns of the altar of incense; here he first put the blood upon the
southeast horn, then upon the northeast, next upon the northwest, and
then upon the southwest; and upon the bottom of that horn where he
finished, he poured the remainder of the blood, which was the southern
bottom (o).

[Leviticus 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 4:26</span></span>

And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, Of burnt offering, that
is, the priest shall do it:

as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings; see [Lev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003.md).

and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin; in
a typical way, directing to the great sacrifice of Christ, which is the
only real atonement and propitiation for sin: the Vulgate Latin, Syriac,
and Arabic versions, render, "the priest shall pray for him": for the
pardon of his sin:

and it shall be forgiven him; not for the prayers of the priest, nor for
the sacrifice offered up, but for the sake of Christ, the antitype of
such sacrifices, and when faith was exercised on him; or the meaning is,
he shall not be punished for it.

[Leviticus 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 4:27</span></span>

And if anyone of the common people sin through ignorance,.... Or, "if
one soul of the people of the earth": that is, a single person, and so
is distinguished from the congregation, one of the common sort of
people; however is neither an high priest, nor a prince, or king, but
either a common priest, or Levite, or Israelite; no man is free from
sin; all sorts of persons, of all ranks and degrees, high and low, rich
and poor, men in office, civil or ecclesiastical, or in whatsoever state
of life, are liable to sin, and do sin continually, either ignorantly or
willingly; and Christ is a sacrifice for all sins and for all sorts of
sinners:

whilst he doeth somewhat; &c. See Gill on [Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md), [Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md), [Lev
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md).

[Leviticus 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 4:28</span></span>

Or if his sin which he hath sinned come to his knowledge,.... So that he
is convinced that he has sinned:

then he shall bring his offering; to the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, to the priest there:

a kid of the goats: a young goat:

a female without blemish; and so inferior to the offering of the ruler
or prince; for the characters of men are aggravations of their sins, and
sacrifices were to be in some measure answerable to them, and suitable
to their circumstances:

for the sin which he hath sinned; to atone for it in a typical way.

[Leviticus 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 4:29</span></span>

And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,.... His
right hand, as the Targum of Jonathan; not the priest that shall offer
it, but the man that has sinned, that brings it, thereby confessing his
sin, and transferring it to the sacrifice:

and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering; that is,
on the north side of the altar.

[Leviticus 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 4:30</span></span>

And the priest shall take of the blood,.... So that all the preceding
actions, the bringing the offering, the putting the hand upon the head
of it, and slaying it, were done by the man that sinned; of this and
what follows here and in the next verse [Lev
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#031.md); see Gill on [Lev
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#025.md), [Lev
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026.md).

[Leviticus 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 4:32</span></span>

And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering,.... As he might if he would;
the Jews observe, that in all places a lamb is put before a goat, as
being more excellent in its kind; but here it is mentioned after, which
shows, they say, that they are equally alike (p):

he shall bring it a female without blemish; typical of Christ the Lamb
of God, without spot and without blemish, [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md).

\(p\) T. Bab. Pesachim, fol. 57. 2. & Ceritot, fol. 28. 2.

[Leviticus 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 4:33</span></span>

He shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,.... On the head
of the lamb, as on the head of the goat, even his right hand, as the
above Targum, as before:

and slay it for a sin offering, in the place where they kill the burnt
offering: for if it was not slain for a sin offering, but for something
else, or on any other account, as for a burnt offering, it was not right
(q).

\(q\) T. Bab. Zebachim, fol. 7. 1. & Menachot, fol. 4. 1.

[Leviticus 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 4:34</span></span>

And the priest shall take of the blood,.... See Gill on [Lev
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#025.md), [Lev
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026.md).
