INTRODUCTION TO NUMBERS 13

In this chapter an order is given by the Lord, to send twelve men into
the land of Canaan, to search and spy it, and which was accordingly
executed, [Num 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md); and the names of
the twelve persons are given, [Num
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004.md); the instructions they received
from Moses, what part of the land they should enter into first, and what
observations they should make on it, [Num
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md); which they attended to, and on
their return brought some of the fruit of the land with them, [Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md); and gave an account of it, that
it was a very fruitful land, but the inhabitants mighty, and their
cities walled, [Num 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027.md); which threw
the people into confusion, but that they were stilled by Caleb, one of
the spies, who encouraged them, [Num
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030.md); but all the rest, excepting
Joshua, brought an ill report of it, as not to be subdued and conquered
by them, [Num 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#031.md).

[Numbers 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 13:1</span></span>

And the Lord Spake unto Moses,.... When in the wilderness of Paran,
either at Rithmah or Kadesh; this was on the twenty ninth day of the
month Sivan, on which day, the Jews say (o), the spies were sent to
search the land, which was a scheme of the Israelites' own devising, and
which they first proposed to Moses, who approved of it as prudential and
political, at least he gave his assent unto it to please the people, and
carried the affair to the Lord, and consulted him about it; who, rather
permitting than approving, gave the following order; for the motion
carried in it a good deal of unbelief, calling in question whether the
land was so good as had been represented unto them, fearing it was not
accessible, and that it would be difficult to get into it, and were
desirous of knowing the best way of getting into it before they
proceeded any further; all which were unnecessary, if they would have
fully trusted in the Lord, in his word, promise, power, providence, and
guidance; who had told them it was a land flowing with milk and honey;
that he would show them the way to it, by going before them in a pillar
of cloud and fire; that he would assuredly bring them into it, having
espied it for them, and promised it unto them; so that there was no need
on any account for them to send spies before them; however, to gratify
them in this point, he assented to it:

saying; as follows.

[Numbers 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 13:2</span></span>

Send thou men,.... Which is rather a permission than a command; so
Jarchi interprets it,"send men according to thy mind, I do not command
thee, but if thou pleasest send;''this he observed was agreeable to
Moses, and to the Israelites, and therefore granted it, or allowed them
to take their own way, and which issued badly, as it always does, when
men are left to their own counsel:

that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children
of Israel; called the land of Canaan, though it consisted of seven
nations, from the principal of them; this God had given in promise to
the children of Israel, and had now brought them to the borders of it;
nay, had given them orders to go up and possess it; but they were for
searching it first, to know what sort of a land it was, and which was
the best way of entering into it, which is here permitted them, see [Deu
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#021.md),

of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man; excepting the tribe
of Levi; the reason of which was because they were to have no
inheritance in the land, [Deu 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009.md);
but then, to make up the number twelve, the two sons of Joseph, Ephraim
and Manasseh, are reckoned as two tribes:

everyone a ruler among them; a prince in his tribe; so were men of
honour and credit, of power and authority, of prudence and probity, and
who might be trusted with such an affair, and their report believed:
they were not indeed princes of the highest rank, not the same that
assisted in taking the numbers of the people, who were captains over
their several tribes, as in [Num 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#004.md),
&c. but were inferior princes and rulers, perhaps rulers of thousands.

[Numbers 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 13:3</span></span>

And Moses, by the commandment of the Lord,.... By his power, permission,
and leave, as Jarchi, that there might be no delay through his means:

sent them from the wilderness of Paran; from Rithmah or Kadeshbarnea,
which seem to be one and the same place in that wilderness: this, as
before observed, was on the twenty ninth day of Sivan: See Gill on [Num
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md),

all those were heads of the children of Israel; were not mean and vulgar
men, but persons of rule, who bore some office of magistracy ant
government among the people in their respective tribes.

[Numbers 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 13:4</span></span>

And these were their names, of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of
Zaccur. From [Num 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004.md), there is
nothing but the names of the said persons, whose sons they were, and of
what tribe; and the several tribes are mentioned, not according to the
order of the birth of the patriarchs, nor according to the dignity of
their mothers that bore them, but, very likely, according to the order
in which they were sent, two by two, to search the land; for had they
gone all twelve in a body, they would have been liable to suspicion: the
signification of their names is of no importance to know, and will give
us no light into their characters or the reason of their choice, nor are
their parents elsewhere taken notice of, nor any of them but Joshua and
Caleb, of whom we shall hear more hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 13:16</span></span>

These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land,....
Which is observed after the catalogue is given of them, [Num
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004.md); and this is repeated that their
names may be taken notice of, which stand on record to the disgrace of
the greater number of them, and to the honour of two only, Joshua and
Caleb; and on the former the following remark is made:

and Moses called Oshea the son of Nun, Jehoshua; whether it was at this
time that Moses gave him this name is not certain; if it was, then he is
called so before by anticipation, for he is several times called so
before this, and even the first time we hear of him, [Exo
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009.md); wherefore Chaskuni reads it,
Moses had called; but Jarchi thinks it was now given him, and that Moses
prayed for him , "Jah" or "Jehovah" save thee from the counsel of the
spies: the name is the same with Jesus, as appears from [Heb
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008.md); and a type he was of Christ the
Saviour, whose name is so called, because he saves his people from their
sins, [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md); and brings them to
heaven, as Joshua was the instrument of saving the Israelites and
bringing them into the land of Canaan.

[Numbers 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 13:17</span></span>

And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan,.... He sent them from
Kadeshbarnea, as Caleb affirms, [Jos
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#007.md),

and said unto them, go ye up this way southward; pointing as it were
with his finger which way they should go, even up such a hill southward;
and which, as Aben Ezra observes, was not the south of the camp, but the
south of the land of Canaan; and who further observes, that it is well
known that Egypt, from whence the Israelites now came, was to the south
of the land of Israel, of which this is a demonstration; the latitude of
Egypt is less than thirty degrees, and the latitude of Jerusalem is
thirty three, and the wilderness of Paran was in the south of the land
of Egypt: it should be rendered by "the south", as in [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022); or from the "south" (p.md), since
the Israelites must go northward, as a learned man (q) observes, to
enter into the land of Canaan: now this south part of Canaan afterwards
belonged to the tribe of Judah, and lying southward, and mountainous,
was dry and barren, [Jos 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md); and
was, as Jarchi says, the dregs of the land of Israel; and here, as he
observes, the same method was taken as merchants do, who, when they show
their goods, show the worst first, and then the best:

and go up into the mountain; which was inhabited by the Amorites, [Deu
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md); and was afterwards called the
mountainous or hill country of Judea, [Luk
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#039.md).

[Numbers 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 13:18</span></span>

And see the land what it is, and the people that dwelleth therein,....
The situation and condition of the country, and the nature, temper,
disposition, and constitution of the inhabitants, by which it might be
judged whether it was a desirable thing to possess it, and whether it
was practicable to subdue and take it:

whether they be strong or weak, few or many; whether able-bodied men fit
for war, and of spirit, strength, and courage, or feeble and
pusillanimous, weak and timorous; and whether their number was small or
great, by which they would be capable of judging whether they were in a
state and condition to defend themselves or not, and whether a conquest
of them was easy or not; the last of the two things in the preceding
clause is first particularly explained and enlarged upon, as is usual in
the Hebrew language.

[Numbers 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 13:19</span></span>

And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad,....
Whether the air is good, the climate temperate, and the earth well
watered, and has good convenience of springs, fountains, and rivers, and
so wholesome or healthful; or otherwise, which is the first thing they
were directed to observe, though here put in the second place:

and what cities they be they dwell in, whether in tents or strong holds;
whether in tents, as the Israelites now lived, and as the Kedarenes, as
Aben Ezra notes, and other Arabians, who encamped in tents, or who dwelt
in villages, and unwalled towns, unfortified cities, according to the
Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan; or whether in fortified cities, towns,
and garrisons; by which it would appear whether it would be easy to come
at them, and fall upon them, or difficult to subdue and conquer them;
for if their cities were fortified, it would not be so easy to take
them, and would require time. Jarchi thinks, that by this it might be
known whether they were men of strength and courage, or whether weak and
fearful persons; seeing if they dwelt in villages they were strong men,
and depended on their own strength, but if they dwelt in fortified
cities, they were weak.

[Numbers 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 13:20</span></span>

And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean,.... That is, what the
soil of it is, whether it be rich and fertile, or whether it be poor and
barren, which would be seen by the fruits it produced, this being now
the fruitful season of the year; and so the Targum of Jonathan,"and what
is the praise of the land, whether its fruits are fat or lean;''plump
and full, rich and juicy, or otherwise, as their grapes, olives, &c.
whether it was a land flowing with milk and honey, [Exo
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#003.md), abounding with all good things,
and those of the best sort, or not:

whether there be wood thereon or not; timber for building, and other
manual operations, or wood for fuel, which are great conveniences in a
country; though the Targum of Jonathan interprets it of fruit-bearing
trees, which bear fruits fit for eating, or not, as apples, pears, figs,
pomegranates, &c.

and be ye of good courage; and not be afraid of being taken up for
spies, suggesting, that the power and providence of God would protect
and preserve them, in which they should put their trust, and be of good
heart:

and bring of the fruit of the land; as a sample and specimen of what it
brought forth, which would serve to encourage and animate the people in
general, to go up and possess it:

now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes; when they and the
other summer fruits were coming to their perfection; and which was a
proper season to see them in, and bring a sample of them; though
Chaskuni suggests, that it was a more dangerous time to bring off fruit,
because the keepers of the vineyards were then there; and hence they
needed strengthening, and are bid to be of good courage; the Targum of
Jonathan is,"the day on which they went was the twenty ninth of the
month Sivan, the time of the first ripe grapes;''and as this month
answers to part of our May and part of June, and it being at the latter
end of that month, it must be about the middle of June; by which we may
observe the forwardness of grapes in the land of Canaan, the time of
vintage now drawing nigh.

[Numbers 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 13:21</span></span>

So they went up and searched the land,.... Went up the mountains as they
were directed, and passed through the whole land; diligently inquired
into everything material belonging to it, according to their
instructions, and made their observations on it, and on the inhabitants,
and their habitations:

from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath; this
wilderness, from whence they went, seems to be the same with the
wilderness of Paran, called Zin; perhaps from the multitude of thorns in
it; but different from the wilderness of Sin, [Exo
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001.md), which was nearer Egypt; but this
was on the south quarter of the land of Canaan, along by the coast of
Edom, [Num 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003.md); Rehob, they are said
to come to first from thence, was in the tribe of Asher in later times,
[Jos 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md); and lay to the north or
northwest of the land of Canaan. Jerom says (r), that in his times there
was a village called Rooba, four miles from Scythopolis. Hamath was the
northern boundary of the land of Israel, and was in the tribe of
Naphtali, when it came into the hands of the Israelites, and lay to the
northeast, as the former place to the northwest, [Num
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#007.md); so that their direction, as they
went, was south and north, and west and east: their journey is described
by Jarchi thus; they went on the borders of it, length and breadth, in
the form of the capital of the letter "gamma"; they went on the south
border from the east corner to the west corner, as Moses commanded them:
"get you up this way southward", [Num
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md); the way of the southeast border
unto the sea, which is the western border; and from thence they
returned, and went on all the western border by the sea shore, until
they came to Hamath, which is by Mount Hor, at the northwest corner; but
Hamath was on the northeast; nor did they go thither, it was too far off
for them, but they went as far as Rehob, which was "as men go to
Hamath", as it should be rendered, that is, it lay in the way to Hamath.

[Numbers 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 13:22</span></span>

And they ascended by the south,.... When they returned, after they had
searched the land, then they came into the south country again, which
was in their way to Kadesh, where the camp of Israel remained; they are
said to ascend, because of the hill country they again came to; for
their coming to Hebron, and carrying a cluster of grapes from that
place, not far from thence, was upon their return:

and came unto Hebron; which was in the hill country of Judea, in the
tribe of Judah afterwards, which before was called Kirjatharba; in the
original text it is, "he came" (s), Caleb, and he only, according to
Jarchi and the Rabbins in Abendana; and certain it is that he was there,
and he had this place on which his feet trod given him for an
inheritance, [Jos 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#009.md); and it is very
probable that the spies did not go together, but perhaps singly, and at
most but two together, which seems to be the case here by what follows:

where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were; where
Anak, and these his three sons, dwelt, who were giants; and perhaps from
thence Hebron before this was called Kirjatharbah, "the city of the
four"; or from Arba, the father of Anak:

now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt; or Tanais, as the
Targum of Jonathan, whence one of the nomes of Egypt was called the
Tanitic nome: it was the metropolis of that country, and may be
observed, to abate the pride and vanity of that kingdom, which boasted
of its antiquity. Josephus says (t), that the inhabitants of Hebron not
only reckoned it more ancient than any of the cities of the land, but
than Memphis in Egypt, accounting it (then in his time) 2300 years old;
but who it was built by is not certain; Jarchi thinks it is possible
that Ham built Hebron for Canaan his younger son, before he built Zoan
for Mizraim his eldest son; which does not seem likely.

[Numbers 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 13:23</span></span>

And they came unto the brook of Eshcol,.... Or "valley of Eshcol" (u),
which is here so called by anticipation from the following circumstance;
and perhaps had not this name given it, until the children of Israel
were possessed of the land, and then they called it so, in memory of
what was done here at this time; it was not far from Hebron, as may be
concluded from thence; and so Jerom, relating the travels of Paula in
those parts, says (w), she came from Betzur to Eshcol, where having seen
the little cells of Sarah, the cradle of Isaac, and the traces of the
oak of Abraham, under which he saw the day of Christ, and was glad,
rising up from thence, she went up to Hebron; which shows this Eshcol to
be near Hebron, and to lie low, and was a valley; see [Deu
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#024.md),

and cut down from thence a branch, with one cluster of grapes; in this
valley was a vineyard, or at least a vine tree, on which they observed
one cluster, which perhaps was of an uncommon size, as it seems by what
follows, and they cut down the branch, and that with it:

and they bare it between two upon a staff; it was so big; and which was
not done only for the ease of carrying it, but that it might not have
any of its grapes squeezed, bruised, and broken off, but that they might
carry it entire and whole for the Israelites to behold: these two men
were probably Caleb and Joshua; though Jarchi says they carried nothing,
which is more than he could say with certainty. Some historians report
very surprising things of the size of vines, and the largeness of their
clusters, which, when observed, this account will not at all seem
incredible. Strabo says (x), it is reported, that in Hyrcania, a vine
produced a firkin of wine, and, the trunk of a vine was so large, that
it was as much as two men could grasp with both arms, and bore clusters
of two cubits long (y); the same he says (z) of the size of vines in
Mauritania, and of their clusters being a cubit long; and of others in
Carmania being two cubits long, as before (a): it is reported of the
Indian fig tree, that it sometimes has an hundred figs more or less on a
branch, and all in a cluster like grapes; and some of the clusters are
sometimes so large as to be carried by two men on a staff (b), as here;
and some have thought, that it is the fruit here meant; but this is
expressly called a cluster of grapes. About half a mile from Eshcol, as
Adrichomius (c) says, was the brook or valley of Sorek, which was famous
for vines; and it is affirmed by many writers and travellers, that to
this day there are vines in that place, which produce clusters of twenty
five pounds weight and more; and that in Lebanon, and other parts of
Syria, the kernels of grapes are as big as a man's thumb (d). Leo
Africanus speaks (e) of grapes in some parts of Africa somewhat red,
which, from their size, are called hens' eggs: and the Talmudists (f)
are extravagant, and beyond all belief, in the account they give of the
vines in the land of Canaan, and of the clusters of them, and the
quantity of wine they had from them; and of this cluster they suppose
(g), that the "two" spoken of are not to be understood of men, but of
bars or staves; and that this cluster was carried by eight, four at the
four ends of the two staves, and that there were, besides, two staves or
bars that went across, at the ends of which were four more men, who
carried the cluster hanging in the middle; a figure of which Wagenseil
(h) has given us: but Philo the Jew (i) has given a better account of
it, and more agreeable to the Scripture, as that it was put upon a
staff, and hung at the middle of it, the ends of which were laid on the
shoulders of two young men, who carried it; though he adds, that such
was the weight of it, that these were relieved by others in succession:

and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs; that is, others
of them did; which seems to favour the notion that they were in a body,
and that there were more than two together at this place; but even these
two might be able to bring some of this sort of fruit along with them,
as well as bear the cluster of grapes; besides, the text does not oblige
us to understand it of the same persons in the same place.

The place was called the brook of Eshcol,.... That is, in later times:

because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down
from thence; the word "Eschol" signifying a "cluster"; and this cluster
was typical of Christ, who may be compared to this, as he is to a
cluster of camphire, [Sol 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014.md); there
being in him a "cluster" of all perfections, of all the perfections of
deity, the whole fulness of the Godhead dwelling bodily in him; and of
all human perfections, he being in all things like unto his people,
excepting sin; and there being also a cluster of all the graces and
gifts of the Spirit without measure in him, as man; and of all the
blessings of grace for his people, as Mediator; and of all the exceeding
great and precious promises of the covenant of grace. The "staff", on
which this was carried, may denote the ministration of the Gospel, which
may seem mean and despicable in itself, but is the means of carrying the
name of Christ, and the things of Christ, about in the world; see [Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md); and the "two" men which bore it,
may signify the prophets of the Old Testament, and the ministers of the
New, who both agree and join together in setting forth the person,
offices, and grace of Christ. Moreover, this cluster may be an emblem of
the Spirit of God, and his grace, and of the rich experience the people
of God have of it in this present lift, while travellers in the
wilderness, as a taste and earnest of the future glory and happiness in
the heavenly Canaan.

And they returned from searching the land after forty days. The Targum
of Jonathan adds, on the eighth day of the month Ab, which answers to
part of July and part of August; so that this must be towards the latter
end of July: some Jewish writers (k) say it was the ninth of Ab; hence
the tradition, that it was decreed on the ninth of Ab concerning their
fathers, that they should not enter into the land (l).

And they went, and came to Moses, and to Aaron,.... They proceeded on
their journey from Eshcol, till they came to the camp of Israel; and as
soon as they came there, went directly to Moses and to Aaron, before
they went into their own tents, as Aben Ezra observes:

and to all the congregation of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,

to Kadesh; that is, Kadeshbarnea, as appears from [Jos
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#007.md); called for brevity's sake
Kadesh; but is by some thought to be different from the Kadesh in [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md); to which the Israelites came not
until thirty eight years after this time: this Kadesh was in the
wilderness of Paran, and the same with Rithmah, or was near it, where
the Israelites were now encamped, and had remained all the time the
spies were gone: the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan call this place
Rekem, as they do in [Gen 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#014.md),

and brought back word unto them, and to all the congregation: to Moses
and Aaron, and the principal heads of the body of the people assembled
together: to these they related an account of their tour through the
land of Canaan, what they had met with, and what observations they had
made, agreeably to the instructions that had been given them when they
set out:

and showed them the fruit of the land; which they had brought with them,
the bunch of grapes, pomegranates, and figs.

[Numbers 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 13:27</span></span>

And they told him,.... Moses, who was the chief ruler whom they
addressed, and to whom they directed their speech:

and said, we came unto the land whither thou sentest us; the land of
Canaan, which they were sent by Moses to spy; this was said by ten of
them or by one of them as their mouth; for Caleb and Joshua did not join
with them in the following account, as appears from [Num
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030.md),

and surely it floweth with milk and honey; they own that the land
answered to the description which the Lord had given of it when it was
promised them by him, [Exo 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md),

and this is the fruit of it; pointing to the bunch of grapes, the
pomegranates and figs; not that these were a proof of its flowing with
milk and honey, at least in a literal sense, but of the goodness and
fruitfulness of the land: though the luxury of Bacchus, the god of wine,
is by the poet (m) described, not only by a fountain of wine, but by
rivers of milk and flows of honey.

Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land,.... Though so
plentiful and fruitful and desirable to enjoy, yet this objection lay
against all hopes and even attempts to possess it, as they thought; the
strength of the people, its present inhabitants, both in body and mind,
being persons of a large, and some of a prodigious stature, and to all
appearance men of valour and courage:

and the cities are walled and very great; and so inaccessible, and able
to hold out a long siege, and repel what force may be brought against
them; so that to attack them would be to little purpose:

and moreover we saw the children of Anak there: whom they had heard of
before, and so had the congregation of Israel, and many terrible and
frightful stories were told of them, and these they now saw with their
eyes, and very formidable they appeared to them; this seems to prove
that others beside Caleb and Joshua were at Hebron, where the sons of
Anak lived, [Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md); and so they
might, and yet not be together with them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 13:29</span></span>

The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south,.... On the southern side
of the land of Canaan: not in it, for they were not Canaanites, but
neighbours to them, and lay nearest to the camp of Israel, and at the
entrance into the land of Canaan; and as they were enemies of Israel, as
appears from an attack upon them quickly after they came from the Red
sea, in Rephidim, [Exo 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md); and
friends to the Canaanites, they would no doubt oppose their passage into
their land, as they did, [Num 14:43](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#043.md);
this is one difficulty in the way of possessing the land hinted at,
others follow:

and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the
mountains; and guard the passes there; so that should they escape the
Amalekites, or get the better of them, they would not be able to pass
the mountains, being so well inhabited and defended; the Hittites seem
to dwell about Mount Lebanon, [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004.md); the Jebusites inhabited the
mountains about Jerusalem, and that itself, which was called by them
Jebus, and from which they were not dispossessed until the times of
David, [Ch1 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#004.md); and the Amorites
were possessed of the mountain which was on the borders of the land,
next to the place where Israel now were, [Deu
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#020.md),

and the Canaanites dwell by the sea; these dwelt both on the east and on
the west of the land, [Jos 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003.md); so
that the western Canaanites dwelt on the shore of the Mediterranean sea,
which is often put for the west in Scripture; and the eastern Canaanites
dwelt by the Dead sea, or by the sea of Tiberias, called sometimes the
lake of Gennesaret, and seems the rather to be meant here by what
follows:

and by the coast of Jordan; so that this river was not passable by them;
for by all this they would suggest that all avenues and passes were
stopped up, so that it was a vain thing to attempt entrance into the
land, or to expect ever to possess it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 13:30</span></span>

And Caleb stilled the people before Moses,.... In his presence, they
standing before him; or "unto Moses" (n), as they were coming to him
with open mouth against him; for upon the above report of the spies they
began to murmur and mutiny, and to speak against Moses for bringing them
out of Egypt into a wilderness, feeding them with vain hopes of a
country which they were never likely to enjoy; and in their wrath they
might be making up to him, threatening to pull him to pieces, but were
restrained by Caleb, who signified he had something to say to them, to
which they attended, he being one of the spies, and for their principal
tribe, the tribe of Judah, that went foremost; the Targum of Jonathan
is,"Caleb silenced the people, and they attended to Moses;''or hearkened
to him, to what he said, which though not here related, is in [Deu
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#029.md); which yet they did not give
credit to, though they heard what he had to say:

and said, let us go up at once and possess it; without any delay, there
is nothing more to be done than to enter and take possession; this he
said, trusting to the promise of God, who is faithful, and to his power
who is able to perform:

for we are well able to overcome it; especially having God on their
side, who had promised to bring them into it, and put them in the
possession of it; and indeed, humanly speaking, they seemed quite
sufficient for such an undertaking, being upwards of six hundred
thousand men fit for war, [Num 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#046.md),
marshalled under their proper standards, with captains over each tribe,
and having such brave, wise, and courageous commanders and generals,
Moses and Joshua, who had given signal instances of their prudence and
bravery already. What is it such an army, under proper directions, might
not undertake? One would think, in all human probability, they were able
to conquer a much greater country than the land of Canaan.

But the men that went up with him,.... With Caleb, all but Joshua: the
other ten

said, we be not able to go up against the people; this they had not said
before, though they plainly suggested it, and, to make the people
believe this, had represented the inhabitants of the land of Canaan in
the light they did; but now, in direct opposition to Caleb, fully
expressed it, giving this reason for it:

for they are stronger than we; being both of a larger size and more
numerous.

And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched
unto the children of Israel,.... Before, they gave a good report of the
land itself, as a very fruitful one, answering to their expectations and
wishes; but now they change their language, and give a different account
of it; which shows their want of integrity, and to what length an
opposition carried them, to say things contrary to their real
sentiments, and to what they themselves had said before:

saying, the land through which we have gone to search it, is a land that
eateth up the inhabitants thereof; the meaning seems to be, that it was
so barren and unfruitful that it did not produce food sufficient for the
inhabitants of it, who were ready to starve, and many did starve through
want, and so was the reverse of what they had before said; for which
reason, Gussetius (o) thinks the sense is, that the land was the food
and nourishment of its inhabitants, and that there was such plenty in it
that it wanted not any foreign assistance in any respect whatever. Some
think that it was continually embroiled in civil wars, in which they
destroyed one another; but then this was no argument against, but for
their going up against them, since through the divisions among
themselves they might reasonably hope the better to succeed; or it ate
them up with diseases, as the Targum of Jonathan adds, and so they would
represent it, though a fruitful land, yet a very unhealthful one, in
which the natives could not live, and much less strangers; and so Aben
Ezra and Ben Gersom interpret it of the badness of the air of the
country, as being very unwholesome and pernicious. Jarchi represents
them as saying, that wherever they came they saw them burying their
dead, as if there was a plague among them; and be it so that there was,
which is not unlikely, since the Lord promised to send hornets before
them, which some interpret of diseases sent, [Exo
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#028.md); and which was in their favour,
since hereby the number of their enemies would be lessened, and they
would be weakened, and in a bad condition to oppose them:

and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature; or men
of measures (p), of a large measure, above the common measure of men;
but it may be justly questioned whether they spoke truth; for though
they might see some that exceeded in height men in common, yet it is not
credible that all they saw were of such a size; since they were not only
at Hebron and saw the giants there who were such, but they went through
the land, as in the preceding clause, and all they met with cannot be
supposed to be of such a measure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 13:33</span></span>

And there we saw the giants,.... Not throughout the land, and yet it is
so expressed, and in such connection with what goes before, that it
might be so understood, and as they might choose it should; that as
there were men everywhere of an uncommon size, and were generally so,
there were some larger than they in all places, of a prodigious size, of
a gigantic stature; and yet this was only in Hebron where they saw them:

the sons of Anak; whose names are given, [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md); and there were but three of
them:

which came of the giants; they, were of the race of giants; for not only
Anak their father, but Arba their grandfather was one; [Jos
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015.md),

and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers; little diminutive
creatures in comparison of them; an hyperbolical exaggeration of the
greatness of the giants, and of their own littleness:

and so we were in their sight; but this they could not be so certain of,
and could only make conjectures by their neglect or supercilious
treatment of them. Jarchi makes them to speak of them more diminutively
still, as that they heard those giants saying one to another,"there are
ants in the vineyards like men.''
