### [1 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 4:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 4

In this chapter is a further account of the tribe of Judah, and of some
principal families in it, [Ch1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md) and
of the tribe of Simeon, their families, cities, and villages, [Ch1
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#024.md) and of the enlargement of their
borders, and conquest of the Amalekites, [Ch1
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#039.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 4:1</span></span>

The sons of Judah: Pharez,.... The posterity of Judah in the line of
Pharez, for he only is mentioned:

Hezron, and Carmi, and Hur, and Shobal. Hezron was the son of Pharez,
and Carmi is supposed to be Chelubai, or Caleb, the son of Hezron; and
Hur the son of Caleb; and Shobal was the son of the second Caleb the son
of Hur; see [Ch1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#005.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 4:2</span></span>

And Reaiah the son of Shobal begat Jahath,.... Reaiah is the same with
Haroeh, [Ch1 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052.md) the names are of the
same signification:

and Jahath begat Ahumai, and Lahad. These are the families of the
Zorathites; who inhabited Zoreah, as the Targum, at least part of it;
see [Ch1 2:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#053.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 4:3</span></span>

And these were of the father of Etam,.... Or of the prince of Etam: or,
as the Targum, these are princes that dwelt in Etam, a place not far
from Zorah, [Jdg 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#008.md) and is mentioned
with Bethlehem and Tekoa in the tribe of Judah, [Ch2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006.md), namely, which follow:

Jezreel, and Ishma, and Idbash; these were the sons of the governor of
Etam:

and the name of their sister was Hazelelponi; who, perhaps, was a person
of great note in those days, though now unknown; indeed, a Jewish
chronologer (w) tells us, that the mother of Samson was Hazalelponith,
of the tribe of Judah.

\(w\) Juchasin, fol. 10. 2.

[1 Chronicles 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 4:4</span></span>

And Penuel the father of Gedor,.... The prince of that place, according
to some, and the same with Hareph, [Ch1
2:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#051.md),

and Ezer the father of Hushah: thought to be the same with Shuah, [Ch1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#011.md),

these are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah: Caleb's wife, [Ch1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019.md) the Targum adds, the same with
Miriam; and so other Jewish writers (x) say, Miriam had two names, and
one was Ephratah; though Josephus makes (y) Hur to be her husband, and
not her son, as here:

who was the father of Bethlehem; of the inhabitants of that city, at
least part of them, or prince of that place, as his grandson Salma also
was, [Ch1 2:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#051.md).

\(x\) Shemot Rabba, sect. 1. fol. 90. 4. Yalkut in 1 Chron. ii. 19. (y)
Antiqu. l. 3. c. 2.

[1 Chronicles 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 4:5</span></span>

And Ashur the father of Tekoa,.... A son of Hezron by Abiah, [Ch1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024.md).

had two wives, Helah and Naarah; as Lamech had, polygamy not being
reckoned unlawful in those times.

[1 Chronicles 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 4:6</span></span>

And Naarah bare him Ahuzam, and Hepher, and Temeni, and Haahashtari,....
Of whom we have no account elsewhere:

these were the sons of Naarah; the second wife of Ashur.

[1 Chronicles 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 4:7</span></span>

And the sons of Helah,.... The other wife:

were Zereth, and Zoar, and Ethnan: nowhere else mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 4:8</span></span>

And Coz,.... Another son of Helah, and brother of the before mentioned:

begat Anub, and Zobebah; of whom we nowhere else read:

and the families of Aharhel, the son of Harum; these were of the
posterity of Coz; the Targum is,

"and the family of Aharhel, this is Hur, the firstborn of Miriam;''which
is not at all probable.

[1 Chronicles 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 4:9</span></span>

And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren,.... The Targum
adds,"and wiser in the law than his brethren;''or he might be a man of
great wealth and riches, or of great strength and courage, all which
make a man honourable; or he may be so called, because a praying man, as
follows, a man of devotion and religion, a man of God, see [Sa1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006.md), but who he was is not easy to
say, probably a son or brother of Harum, or however that belonged to one
of the families of Aharhel, mentioned in the preceding verse; for that
he was Othniel, as say the Targumist and other Jewish writers (z), is
not probable, and besides is after spoken of distinct from him, [Ch1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md).

and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, because I bare him with
sorrow; either with sorrow for her husband, being dead, or by reason of
very sharp pains she endured at the birth of him; he was another Benoni.

\(z\) T. Bab. Temurah, fol. 16. 1.

[1 Chronicles 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 4:10</span></span>

And Jabez called on the God of Israel,.... Or prayed to him, as the
Targum; though some understand it as a vow, promising what he would do
if God would do thus and thus for him; the Syriac and Arabic versions
read in the third person, taking it to be what others, his parents and
friends, wished for him:

let him bless thee,.... but they are doubtless his own words, and a
supplication of his to the Lord:

saying, oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed; the Targum adds, with
children; but he no doubt prayed for greater blessings than any outward
or temporal ones are, even spiritual blessings, covenant blessings, the
sure mercies of David, which are solid, substantial, durable, and
irreversible:

and enlarge my coast; the Targum is,"multiply my borders with
disciples.''It may be understood of an enlargement of the borders of his
country, by expelling the Canaanites that might dwell in it, and of an
increase of his worldly substance for good ends and purposes; or rather
of a spiritual enlargement by deliverance from spiritual enemies, and of
grace as to exercise; and particularly of spiritual light and knowledge,
and of the affections and desires of the soul after divine things, see
[Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md).

and that thine hand might be with me; the Targum adds, in business,
prospering and succeeding him; the sense may be, that his hand of
providence might be with him to protect him, of grace and love to
comfort and help him in every time of need, of wisdom to direct him, and
of power to keep him:

and that thou wouldest keep me from evil; from the evil of affliction,
and especially from the evil of sin, and from the evil one, Satan, and
from all evil men and evil company; the Targum is,"and make me
companions such as I am:''that it may not grieve me; alluding to his
name Jabez, which he had from the sorrow and grief of his mother; and
nothing is more grieving to a good man than the evil of sin, so contrary
to the nature and will of God, being committed against a God of infinite
love, grace, and mercy, whereby the name, ways, and truths of Christ are
dishonoured, and the Spirit of God grieved, and saints are bereaved of
much comfort; and therefore desire to be kept from it, knowing they
cannot keep themselves, but the Lord can and will, at least from the
tyranny of it, and destruction by it: the Targum is,"lest the evil
figment (or corruption of nature) should move or provoke me:"

and God granted him that which he requested; as he does whatever is
asked in faith, according to his will, and will make for his glory, and
the good of his people; see [Jo1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 4:11</span></span>

And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir,.... If Shuah is the same
with Hushah, [Ch1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004.md), then Chelub was
the son of Ezer:

which was the father of Eshton; not the prince of a place called Eshton,
as Vatablus; for it is the name of a man, the son of Mehir, and who in
the next verse is said to beget sons.

[1 Chronicles 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 4:12</span></span>

And Eshton begat Bethrapha,.... Or the family of Rapha:

and Paseah, and Tehinnah the father of Irnahash; or the city of Nahash;
Tehinnah seems to have been the prince or governor of a city, so called:

these are the men of Rechah; these sons of Eshton dwelt in a place
called Rechah; the Targum, without any reason, says, these are the men
of the great sanhedrim.

[1 Chronicles 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 4:13</span></span>

And the sons of Kenaz,.... Who was either the son of Chelub, or of
Eshton:

Othniel, and Seraiah; the first of these is he who is mentioned, [Jos
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#017.md) and was the first judge in
Israel:

and the son of Othniel, Hathath; and the next mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 4:14</span></span>

And Meonothai,.... Another son of Othniel:

begat Ophrah; and Seraiah, the brother of Othniel, begat Joab; not
David's general, but another of the same name, who lived long before
him, see [Ch1 2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054.md).

the father of the valley of Charashim: of the inhabitants of the valley,
or the prince of them, called the valley of craftsmen, [Neh
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#035.md) the reason of which is here
given:

for they were craftsmen; that dwelt in it, carpenters and smiths, both
which the word signifies, men that wrought in stone, wood, and iron.

[1 Chronicles 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 4:15</span></span>

And the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh,.... Jephunneh is not the
same with Hezron, as the Targum, but another son of Kenaz, hence called
the Kenezite, [Jos 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md) and brother of
Othniel; and Caleb his son is the same that was sent one of the spies of
the land of Canaan by Moses, see [Num
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#006.md).

his sons were Iru, Elah, and Naam; of whom we nowhere else read:

and the sons of Elah, even Kenaz; another Kenaz, or rather it should be
read Uknaz; so Jarchi and Kimchi.

[1 Chronicles 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 4:16</span></span>

And the sons of Jehaleleel,.... Who probably was the son of Uknaz:

Ziph, and Ziphah, Tiria, and Asareel; there were two cities in the tribe
of Judah of the name of Ziph, [Jos
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024.md), which might be called from
these men, or from Ziph in [Ch1 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 4:17</span></span>

And the sons of Ezra,.... Who was perhaps the son of Asareel, last
mentioned:

Jether, and Mered, and Epher, and Jalon; only one of them, Mered, is
after mentioned:

and she bare Miriam; which is not the name of a woman, but of a man, as
Kimchi observes; and, according to him, his mother was the wife of
Mered, which he gathers from the next verse; though she seems to be the
wife of Ezra, who bare him other sons:

and Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa; a prince of a city in
the tribe of Judah, so called, [Jos
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#050.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 4:18</span></span>

And his wife Jehudijah,.... Another wife of Ezra; or, according to
Kimchi, of Mered; a Jewess, as the word is by some rendered, to
distinguish her from another wife, an Egyptian, in the latter part of
the verse:

bare Jered the father of Gedor, and Heber the father of Socho, and
Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah; who were princes, as Jarchi seems
rightly to observe; of several cities of these names in the tribe of
Judah, as of Gedor, see [Jos 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058.md), of
Socoh, [Jos 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035.md), of Zanoah, [Jos
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034.md), the Targum interprets the names
of all these men of Moses, whom Pharaoh's daughter brought up; and so
other Jewish writers (a), into which mistake they were led by what
follows:

and these are the sons of Bithiah, the daughter of Pharaoh, which Mered
took; that is, to wife; this Mered was one of the sons of Ezra, [Ch1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017.md) the Targum, and other Jewish
writers (b), say this was Caleb, called Mered, because he rebelled
against the counsel of the spies; but this contradicts their other
notion of Jehudijah, or Bithiah, Pharaoh's daughter, whom he married,
the one who brought up Moses, since Moses was elder than Caleb; but
Bithiah, whom Mered married, was not a daughter of Pharaoh king of
Egypt, but of an Israelite of this name; her sons are supposed to be
those in the latter part of [Ch1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 4:19</span></span>

And the sons of his wife Hodiah,.... Another wife of Mered. Hillerus (c)
takes her to be the same with Jehudijah, [Ch1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#018), though some (d.md) take Hodiah to
be the name of a man, and read the words, "and the sons of the wife of
Hodiah"; which wife of Hodiah was

the sister of Naham; or rather Achotnaham, we render the sister of
Naham, is the name of the first son of Hodiah, as some think (e):

the father of Keilah the Garmite; prince of the city of Keilah, in the
tribe of Judah, [Jos 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044.md) who sprung
from the family of Garmi:

and Eshtemoa the Maachathite; the father or prince of the inhabitants of
Eshtemoa, another city in the same tribe, see [Ch1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017.md) who sprung from Maachah, see [Ch1
2:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#048.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 4:20</span></span>

And the sons of Shimon,.... Perhaps another son of Mered by his last
wife, or the same with Shammai, [Ch1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017.md) were

Amnon, and Rinnah, Benhanan, and Tilon; nowhere else mentioned:

and the sons of Ishi: who it may be was the brother of Shimon or Tilon:
were

Zoheth, and Benzoheth; of whom we know no more than their names.

[1 Chronicles 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 4:21</span></span>

The sons of Shelah, the son of Judah, were,.... The genealogy of the
posterity of Judah, in the lines of Pharez and Zerah, being given, and
very largely in that of the former, because of the honour of David, and
his kingdom, which sprang from thence, as Jarchi observes, and also the
King Messiah, the writer returns to give an account of his posterity by
Shelah, a son he had by the daughter of Shuah, [Gen
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#002.md) and the only one that had
children: which were as follow:

Er the father of Lecah: prince of a city of this name in the tribe of
Judah; Shelah gave him the name of Er, in memory of his brother, [Gen
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#003.md),

and Laadah the father of Mareshah; prince of a city of this name in the
same tribe, [Jos 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044.md).

and the families of the house of them that wrought fine linen, of the
house of Ashbea; which last clause explains what house these families
were of, which sprang from Shelah, and were employed in making fine
linen; the Targum adds, for the garments of kings and priests, or for
the curtains of the tabernacle, as Jarchi; for not with the Egyptians
and Greeks only fine linen was made, but among the Hebrews, as Pausanias
(f) testifies.

\(f\) Eliac. 1. sive, l. 5. p. 294.

[1 Chronicles 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 4:22</span></span>

And Jokim,.... The Vulgate Latin version is:

and he that made the sun to stand: as if Joshua was meant; and in the
Talmud it is (g) said Jokim, this is Joshua, who confirmed the oath to
the Gibeonites; and the Targum here is,

"and the prophets of the scribes that sprang from the posterity of
Joshua;''but Joshua was of the tribe of Ephraim, and not of Judah;
though some interpret it of Elimelech, as Lyra observes (h), of whom the
fable is, that the sun stood still at his prayers, as it did in Joshua's
time, to convert the men of Bethlehem; but Jokim is no doubt the proper
name of some famous man or family that descended from Shelah:

and the men of Chozeba: which signifies a lie; and the Targum interprets
it of the Gibeonites, who lied to Joshua; but those were Canaanites, and
not of the posterity of Shelah, and tribe of Judah; Chezib, or Achzib, a
city in the tribe of Judah, very probably is meant, as Kimchi, the very
place where Shelah was born, [Gen 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#005.md)
and where dwelt some of his posterity:

and Joash and Saraph, who had the dominion in Moab; some render the
word, "which married in Moab"; and so the Targum interprets it of Mahlon
and Chilion, who took wives of the daughters of Moab; but rather it is
to be understood of some who were governors in Moab in the times of
David, when Moab was subdued by him, [Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md) or however were such, who, at one
time or another, made war with Moab, and overcame them:

and Jashubilehem: which the Targumist understands of Boaz, prince of the
wise men of the school of Bethlehem, and the Talmudists (i) of Ruth,
that dwelt in Bethlehem; and may be interpreted of some of the
inhabitants of that place which sprang from Shelah; or rather is the
name of a single man, famous in his time, though not now known:

and these are ancient things; an account of persons that lived in
ancient times, and which the writer of this book gives not on his own
knowledge, but by tradition, or rather by inspiration.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 4:23</span></span>

These were the potters,.... Or are the potters; the posterity of those
men, who were so famous in their day, are now of mean employments: some
of them made earthen pots; and some of them

dwelt among plants and hedges; or were employed in planting gardens and
orchards, and making fences for them; or, as others think, "dwelt in
Netaim and Gadara", cities in the tribe of Judah:

there they dwelt with the king for his work; to make pots, plant
gardens, and set hedges for him; either for the king of Judah, or it may
be for the king of Babylon, where they were carried captive, and now
chose to remain, doing those servile works for the king, without the
city, in the fields.

[1 Chronicles 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 4:24</span></span>

The sons of Simeon,.... The account of whom, next to the tribe of Judah,
is given before Reuben, because its inheritance lay in the tribe of
Judah, [Jos 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md) his sons were Nemuel,
the same with Jemuel, [Gen 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#010.md).

and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul; who, in the place referred to, is
said to be the son of a Canaanitish woman; and Jarib and Zerah are the
same with Jachin and Zohar there: and Obed is here omitted, it may be
because he died without issue; see [Num
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 4:25</span></span>

Shallum his son,.... The son of Shaul, and Mibsam was the son of
Shallum, and Mishma the son of Mibsam.

[1 Chronicles 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 4:26</span></span>

And the sons of Mishma,.... These were Hamuel, Zacchur, and Shimei.

[1 Chronicles 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 4:27</span></span>

And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters,.... None of which are
mentioned by name:

but his brethren had not many children: Hamuel and Zacchur:

neither did all their family multiply like to the children of Judah: to
show the fruitfulness and great increase of which tribe, the
genealogical account of it, in this and the two preceding chapters, is
given.

[1 Chronicles 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 4:28</span></span>

And they dwelt at Beersheba,.... posterity of Simeon; and this and the
other places of their habitation are mentioned in the same order, and
with very little variation of names to the end of [Ch1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031.md), as in [Jos
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002.md) and here, at [Ch1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031.md) it is added:

these were their cities unto the reign of David; when, according to

restored them to the tribe of Judah.

And their villages were Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and Ashan,
five cities. There are but four mentioned in [Jos
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007.md) one might be added since, or new
built, namely, Tochen; these, according to Kimchi, were all that
remained for them to dwell in, in the times of David; and therefore they
were obliged to seek out for new settlements for themselves and flocks,
as in [Ch1 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#039.md), &c.

And all their villages that were round about the same cities, unto
Baal,.... The same with Baalathbeer, [Jos
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#008.md).

these were their habitations, and their genealogy; as before described,
until the times of David.

And Meshobab, and Jamlech,.... These, with those that follow to the end
of [Ch1 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#037.md) were famous men in the
tribe of Simeon, of rank and dignity, and eminent for courage and
valour, as the latter part of the chapter testifies, though they are
nowhere else taken notice of. Jamlech, as Fabritius (k) observes, is not
very different from Jamblichus, the name of a famous Platonic
philosopher.

These mentioned by their names were princes in their families,.... The
principal men of them, heads of their fathers' houses:

and the house of their fathers increased greatly; by them, so that they
were obliged to seek out for new habitations, as follows.

And they went to the entrance of Gedor,.... There was a city of this
name in the tribe of Judah, [Ch1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#018.md)
but this seems to be further off, and perhaps is the same with Gedaris,
mentioned by Strabo (l) along with Azotus and Askelon, cities that
belonged to the Philistines; since it was inhabited by the posterity of
Ham, of whom the Philistines were, as in the following verse:

even unto the east side of the valley; which was near to Gedor, and a
suitable place:

to seek pasture for their flocks; their sheep and goats.

And they found fat pasture and good,.... In or near the valley of Gedor:

and the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; there was room enough
for them and their flocks, and they had no enemies on either side to
disturb them:

for they of Ham had dwelt there of old; either the Canaanites who
descended from Canaan the son of Ham, and had never been expelled from
thence; or the Philistines, who were a colony of the Egyptians, the
posterity of Ham; and these inhabitants being of this cursed race, the
Simeonites scrupled not to dispossess them.

And these written by name,.... Before in [Ch1
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#034.md),

came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; as Dr. Lightfoot (m) thinks,
not within the first fourteen years of his reign, when the Syrian army
was abroad, and none dost peep out, but in his last fifteen years, when
the army was destroyed and gone:

and smote their tents; the tents of those who dwelt there for the sake
of feeding their flocks, and whose pasturage the Simeonites wanted:

and the habitations that were found there; or the Meunaim or Maonites,
which the Septuagint Version here calls Mineans, a people sometimes
mentioned along with the Philistines, and others: see [Jdg
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011.md).

and destroyed them utterly unto this day: to the writing of this book;
they had not then recovered their possessions:

and dwelt in their room, because there was pasture there for their
flocks; which was the thing they were in search of.

And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men went to
Mount Seir,.... In the land of Edom:

having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and
Uzziel, the sons of Ishi; these four captains are said, by the ancient
Rabbins, to be of the tribe of Manasseh, as Kimchi observes; see [Ch1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#024.md) but as the five hundred they were
at the head of were of the sons of Simeon, the captains, no doubt, were
of the same race.

And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped,.... That
escaped the sword of Saul; though, according to the Jews (n), 100,000 of
them were slain by him in one day; and of the sword of David, though he
is said not to leave man or woman alive, [Sa1
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md).

and dwelt there unto this day; in the cities of the Amalekites, even of
the posterity of the above; who were some of the remnant of Israel, that
were not carried away by the king of Assyria, and who dwelt here after
the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, even in the times
of Ezra, the writer of this book; see [Ch2
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#009.md).
