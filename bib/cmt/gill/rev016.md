INTRODUCTION TO REVELATION 16

This chapter gives an account of the pouring out of the seven vials by
the angels; their orders for it are in [Rev
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md). The first angel pours out his
vial on the earth, the effect of which is a noisome and grievous sore
upon the followers of antichrist, and the worshippers of his image, [Rev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md). The second pours out his upon
the sea; the events of it are, the sea became blood, and every living
creature in it died, [Rev 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#003.md). The
third pours out his upon the rivers and fountains of water, which
thereby became blood; upon which the angel of the waters applauds the
justice of God, declaring the righteousness of his judgments, and giving
a reason for it; and which is confirmed by another angel from the altar,
[Rev 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#004.md). The fourth angel pours out
his vial on the sun, the effects of which are, scorching men with heat,
their blasphemy against God, and impenitence, [Rev
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#008.md). The fifth pours out his on the
seat of the beast, the consequences of which are darkness in his
kingdom, men gnawing their tongues because of their pains, their
blasphemy of the name of God because of them, and their impenitence,
[Rev 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#010.md). The sixth angel pours out
his on the river Euphrates, and what followed upon it are, the drying up
of that river to make way for the kings of the east; there unclean
spirits are seen, described by their original, coming out of the mouths
of the dragon, beast, and false prophet; by their form, like frogs; by
their internal nature, spirits of devils; by their works, doing
miracles; by the errand they are sent, and go upon, to gather the kings
of the earth to the battle of God Almighty, which they succeed in; but
before this is done, a declaration is made of the suddenness of Christ's
coming, exciting the saints to watchfulness, and to keep their garments,
that they might not be naked, and exposed to shame, [Rev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md) Then the seventh angel pours out
his vial into the air, the consequences of which are, a voice from
heaven declaring it is done: other voices, thunderings, lightnings, and
an earthquake; a rupture of the great city into three parts; the fall of
other cities; the remembrance of Babylon before God; the flight of every
island and mountain, and a great hail storm, which causes men to
blaspheme God, [Rev 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017.md).

[Revelation 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 16:1</span></span>

And I heard a great voice out of the temple,.... The church, which in
the preceding chapter is said to be opened; this was either the voice of
God, whose temple the church is, and where he dwells, and who, has power
over these plagues, [Rev 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#009.md) and who,
when he is about to bring judgments on the earth, is said to roar out of
Zion, [Rev 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#016.md) or of Christ, who is
always in the midst of his church and people, and whose voice is as the
voice of many waters; see [Rev 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015.md)
or it may be of one of the four living creatures, the ministers of the
word, in and by whom Christ often speaks; and the rather, since one of
these gave the seven angels the golden vials of the wrath of God, they
are now bid to pour out.

Saying to the seven angels, go your ways and pour out the vials of the
wrath of God upon the earth; for though these angels had the seven last
plagues to inflict, and the seven vials of God's wrath to pour out, and
were in a readiness to do it, yet they did not move without an order,
which is here given them; and they are bid to go their ways, from the
temple, the church, where they were, and of which they were members, to
the several parts of the antichristian empire; and there pour out all
the wrath and vengeance of God upon his enemies, and theirs, and leave
nothing behind, but give them the dregs of every cup of his fury: the
earth here is to be taken in a larger sense than in the following verse,
and includes the land and sea, the fountains and rivers, and even the
ambient air, and also the sun in the firmament, as the pouring out of
these vials upon them show; and designs the whole apostate church,
consisting of earthly men, all the inhabitants of the earth, that
worship the beast. The Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and
Arabic versions, and the Complutensian edition, read, "the seven vials
of the wrath of God"; these seven vials are not contemporary, much less
the same with the seven trumpets; there is indeed a likeness between
them in some things, especially in the first four; for as the first four
trumpets affect the earth, the sea, the fountains, and rivers of water,
and the sun, so the first four vials are poured out on the same, and
that in the same order; first on the earth, and then on the sea, &c. and
which will give some light, and be a direction to observe the several
parts of the antichristian empire, which will suffer by these vials, and
the in which their ruin will proceed; and as the trumpets were so many
gradual steps to the ruin of the Roman empire, eastern and western, when
become Christian, so these vials are so many gradual steps to, and which
issue in the ruin of, both the eastern and western antichrist; though
they do not respect the same things, nor the same times: the trumpets
respect the Roman empire as Christian, under the government of emperors,
after the downfall of Paganism in it; and the vials respect the
antichristian powers in their several branches, under the pope and Turk.
Antichrist did not appear until the fifth trumpet sounded, whereas the
first vial is poured out upon his followers and worshippers, [Rev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md) from whence it is a clear point,
that the first trumpet and the first vial cannot be contemporary; and
the same judgment may be made of the rest: and it may be further
observed, that these vials are only poured out on the enemies of God and
of Christ, and of his church and people; for no wrath can be poured out
upon the saints, not the least drop of it can fall upon them; this would
not be consistent with God's everlasting love to them, with the
satisfaction of Christ made for them, nor with the blessings of
justification, pardon, adoption, &c. bestowed on them; not but that they
may meet with trouble in the of these vials, through the wars that will
be in the world, and through the struggles of the beast of Rome,
especially its last, which will be the hour of temptation, and that time
of trouble than which never was the like; yet all will work for, and
issue in their good, and they will rejoice in God's righteous judgments;
the blow will be upon antichrist, the vengeance of God will fall upon
those that have the mark of the beast, and the worshippers of his image,
upon the seat of the beast, even upon Babylon, and the whole Romish
jurisdiction, as appears from [Rev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md) and also upon the Turkish empire,
and all the nations engaged in the interest of both pope and Turk, [Rev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md) and it is easy to observe, that
there is in many of these vials an allusion to the plagues of Egypt; in
the first, [Rev 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md) to the plague of
boils, [Exo 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#008.md) in the second and
third, [Rev 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#003.md) to that of turning
the waters of Egypt into blood, [Exo
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019.md) in the fourth, [Rev
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#010.md) to the darkness that was over
all the land of Egypt, [Exo 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021.md) and
in the fifth there is a manifest reference to the frogs that distressed
the Egyptians, [Exo 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#005.md) and in the
seventh, to the plague of hail, [Exo
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#023.md) and they have much the same
effect, even the hardening of those on whom they fall, being far from
being brought to repentance by them, [Rev
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#009.md) and this confirms the application
of the vials to the destruction of Rome, which is spiritually called
Egypt, [Rev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md) and may assure that
they will issue in the ruin of antichrist, and in the salvation of God's
people, as the plagues of Egypt did in the destruction of Pharaoh, and
in the deliverance of the children of Israel; and may also lead us to
conclude, that there will be a like quick execution of the one as of the
other; for as the plagues of Egypt came very quick one after another, so
it seems as if the pouring out of these vials would be in like manner;
the angels receive them together, and have their orders at the same
time; and they go forth immediately, one after another, if not together,
to the respective parts where they are to pour them forth, and which
they do directly; see [Rev 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#008.md).
Moreover, these vials will affect antichrist both with respect to his
civil and ecclesiastic capacity, or both in temporals and spirituals,
and, both antichrists, eastern and western: whether they are begun to be
poured out or not, is a question. I am ready to think they are not,
because they seem to me to refer to the seventh trumpet, which as yet
has not sounded, and are the same with the wrath of God, and the time of
the judging the dead, or avenging the blood of the saints, which will be
come when that sounds, [Rev 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md).
Besides, the outer court is not entirely given to the Gentiles, nor the
witnesses slain, which must be before this time of wrath upon
antichrist; not but that there has been some manifest marks of the
divine displeasure upon the whore of Rome, and she has been sinking ever
since the Reformation, at which time some begin these vials, or before;
and she is reduced to a low estate; yet I think not to such a degree as
these vials express.

[Revelation 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 16:2</span></span>

And the first went,.... The Arabic and Ethiopic versions read, "the
first angel", and who undoubtedly is meant, who readily and cheerfully
obeyed the orders given him, as did the rest; by this angel cannot be
meant Pope Adrian, as Lyra, a Popish interpreter, imagines; for a pope
would never hurt the worshippers of the beast, as this angel does;
rather some Christian Protestant prince or magistrate is designed, and
Brightman applies it to Queen Elizabeth; though a set of kings and
princes yet to come seem to be intended:

and poured out his vial upon the earth; not upon the whole earth, and
the inhabitants of it; not upon the temple or church of God, and the
worshippers in it, which are measured, hid, and protected; nor upon the
Roman Pagan empire, which was destroyed under the sixth seal, and which
never had any worshippers of the beast and his image in it, for then he
was not risen; nor upon the whole apostate church, only a part of it:
some think the meaner and vulgar sort of Papists are meant, who were
reformed by the Waldenses, Wycliff, Huss, and others before Luther; but
rather the antichristian powers on the continent are designed, and
particularly Germany; for as the first trumpet affected the earth, [Rev
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#007.md) and brought the Goths into
Germany, and other inland countries on the continent; so this first vial
affects the earth, and brings distress upon the Popish party in the same
place: and this respects not the Reformation by Luther, as some have
thought, nor the wars of the Turks here in the last age; though were it
not for some things unfulfilled, which are to precede these vials, one
would be tempted to think that this vial was now pouring out upon the
empire; but I rather think this refers to a time of distress yet to come
on those parts, and which will issue in a reformation from Popery again;
for it should be observed, and it may be observed once for all, that
though these vials are so many plagues upon antichrist, they are each of
them so many steps to the advancement of Christ's kingdom and glory:

and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the
mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image; that is,
who were professors of the Popish religion, and adherents of the pope of
Rome in those parts; see [Rev 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015.md)
who will only feel the effects of this vial, and that by a noisome and
grievous sore falling on them, in allusion to the plague of boils in
Egypt, [Exo 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#008.md) by which may be meant,
either literally something external, but not the plague in Dioclesian's
time, for then the beast was not risen; and there were none that could
have his mark or worship his image: some have thought the French disease
is intended, which first appeared in the world in 1490, among the
Papists, as a just judgment upon them for the horrible and unnatural
lusts and uncleanness of the Romish clergy; and others understand it of
a very great heat, which will be before the burning of the world, and
will raise blisters and boils upon men: or rather this may design
something internal, either the remorse of their consciences, reflections
on their past practices, and black despair and horror of mind; and their
madness, wrath, and fury, their malice and envy at the success of the
preachers of the Gospel, and of Protestant states and princes against
them; see [Deu 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md). Moreover, their
secret and wicked practices, both in political and ecclesiastical
affairs, will be discovered, and they will appear with boils and
blotches upon them all over, which will render them odious to the
people, and be the means of a general reformation. Mr. Daubuz thinks the
curse of wickedness in the ninth and tenth centuries, after the
invocation of saints and angels, and the worship of images were settled,
is meant.

[Revelation 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 16:3</span></span>

And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea,.... Not
literally; and so does not design the stagnation of it, which it is
thought will be before the general conflagration; see [Amo
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#004.md) nor is it to be understood of the
sea of this world, and the men of it, who are like a troubled sea; but
rather of Popish doctrines and councils, which are a sea of errors, and
will now be confuted and put an end to. Brightman applies it to the
council of Trent, and makes this angel to be Chemnitius, a German
divine, who wrote a confutation of it; but as the sea is a collection of
many waters, and many waters in this book signify the people and nations
under the Romish yoke, sea here may design the whole jurisdiction of
Rome, or mystical Babylon; see [Jer
51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036.md) and particularly its maritime
powers, Spain and Portugal: and as the second trumpet affected the sea,
[Rev 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#008.md) and brought the Vandals into
Spain and Portugal, so this second vial affects the sea, and brings
great wars, slaughter, and bloodshed into these parts, when they also
will be reformed from Popery:

and it became as the blood of a dead man; thick, clotted together, and
putrid, and so never to be returned to their former state:

and every living soul died in the sea: those, that are not reformed will
either die by the sword, or fly into other parts; for there will be no
comfortable living for the Popish party in those countries where now
they live in power, ease, and affluence. This, and the following vial,
are referred by Mr. Daubuz, the one to the first crusades, or holy wars,
for the regaining of the holy land, and the other to the latter of them.

[Revelation 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 16:4</span></span>

And the third angel poured his vial upon the rivers and fountains of
waters,.... Which also is not to be literally understood of a stagnation
of them, before the burning of the world; nor of the destruction of
Popish fleets and navies, such as the Spanish armada in 1588, and others
since; but rather of Popish writings, of the most learned and subtle men
among them, who like rivers and fountains, which supply and fill the
sea, support and keep up the Romish jurisdiction and hierarchy; and of
the confutation of them by Protestant writers; and of the utter
destruction of their principal orders, and chief men among them, as
cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, Jesuits, &c. though it seems
chiefly to design the places near to Rome, such as Italy and Savoy; for
as the third trumpet affects the rivers and fountains, [Rev
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#010.md) and brings in the Huns into
Italy, and issued in the destruction of the empire; so the third vial
affects the same, and brings terrible wars, and great effusion of blood,
where so much of the blood of the saints have been shed: hence it
follows, and they became blood; these countries will be covered with
blood, and a reformation will ensue upon it; the allusion is to [Exo
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019.md).

[Revelation 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 16:5</span></span>

And I heard the angel of the waters say,.... So we read in Jewish
writings (t) of an angel that was , "the prince of the sea", and of
angels that were over the waters, and others over fire (u); though here
is designed not one of the "angels of the water", that presided ove the
waters, as another over fire; See Gill on [Rev
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018.md), but the third angel that poured
out his vial upon the waters; when he had so done, he said as follows.
Dr. Lightfoot thinks, and that not without reason, that since these
angels appeared in the garb of priests, [Rev
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006.md) and since there was a priest
appointed to take care of the wells, and fountains, and ditches about
Jerusalem, that the people might have water at the feasts (w), there is
an allusion to him; and certain it is that there was such an officer;
there was one Nechoniah, who was over the fountains and ditches (x); and
in the same office was Nicodemon ben Gorion (y), thought to be the
Nicodemus mentioned in the New Testament.

Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shall be: which may
be understood either of God the Father, who had power over these
plagues, [Rev 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#009.md) and sent them; or
of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all, and is righteous in all
his ways and works, in all his judgments on antichrist, and is the
eternal "I AM", which is, and was, and shall be; see [Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008.md). The Alexandrian copy, and most
others, and the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions, read "holy", instead
of "shalt be"; for the purity and holiness of Christ will be seen in the
judgments which he will exercise, as follows:

because thou hast judged thus; or "these things"; or "them", as the
Ethiopic version reads; that is, has brought these judgments upon the
men signified by rivers and fountains, and made great havoc and
slaughter of them, expressed by their becoming blood; the justice of
which appears from the following reason.

\(t\) T. Bab. Gittin, fol. 68. 3. (u) Yalkut Simeoni, par. 2. fol. 58.
4. par. 2. fol. 167. 4. (w) Maimon, Cele Hamikdash, c. 7. sect. 15. (x)
Misn. Shekalim, c. 5. sect. 1. (y) Abot R. Nathan, c. 5. fol. 3. 2.

[Revelation 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 16:6</span></span>

For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets,.... Which shows
that rivers and fountains cannot be literally understood, but men are
designed, wicked and bloody men; and it is notorious to all, how much of
the blood of the saints, of the preachers of the Gospel, of the prophets
and witnesses, have been shed in Italy, Savoy, and other places near
Rome, as well as in Rome itself; see [Rev
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#006.md).

And thou hast given them blood to drink; sent the sword among them,
making great slaughter and devastation; see [Isa
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026.md)

for they are worthy; or deserving, to have their blood shed by the law
of retaliation.

[Revelation 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 16:7</span></span>

And I heard another out of the altar say,.... That is, another angel
that came out of the altar; see [Rev
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018.md) and who represents the souls
under the altar, whose blood had been shed by the above persons; compare
with this [Rev 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md) though, there, such
whose blood had been shed by Rome Pagan are described; the Ethiopic
version calls this angel as before, "the angel of the fountains of
water"; and the Alexandrian copy, and Syriac and Arabic versions, read,
"I heard the altar saying": as follows,

even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments; the
same as in [Rev 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md). This angel joins
the other, and approves and confirms what he says; applauding the
judgements of Christ upon the worshippers of the beast, from the verity
of them, being what were threatened, and from the justice of them, being
what they deserved.

[Revelation 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 16:8</span></span>

And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun,.... Not
literally; and so designs not a violent heat, which shall go before, and
be a preparation for the burning of the world; nor any sore famine
arising from it, which would be common to all, good and bad; but
mystically: some understand this of Christ, the sun of righteousness,
not of any wrath that shall be poured forth on him again, being now
justified in the Spirit; but either of that clear shining of Christ in
the ministry of the word, in those times this vial refers to; when
Zion's light will be come, and the light of the sun will be seven fold,
and Christ alone will be exalted; which clear ministration of Christ,
though it will not savingly enlighten, yet will convict and confound the
antichristian party; they will be scorched with the beams of heat and
light, which will dart from hence; these will torture them, and fill
them with envy, rage, and malice, because they will not be able to
obscure this light, or stop the progress of it; they themselves will be
so enlightened by it, as to see and know the truth of Christ's person,
and offices, and grace, and yet will sin against it, and so be guilty of
blasphemy against the Spirit of God, a sin which will greatly prevail
among them; and they will, like the clay, be the more hardened by this
light and heat, and will not repent of their sins and errors, nor
confess them, nor own the light and conviction they have received: or
else of the wrath of Christ, which he will be moved by this angel to
stir up against the antichristian party, and which they will be sensible
of, and be fearfully looking for. Others, and which comes much to the
same sense, understand this of the Scriptures, the fountain of spiritual
light, and of the clear interpretation of them in those times; when the
watchmen shall see eye to eye, and when the day shall declare and make
manifest every man's work, and the fire reveal and try it; and the same
effects upon the antichristian party shall follow as before: but I
rather think this refers to some part of the antichristian state, as in
the other vials, or to something belonging to it; some have thought that
the house of Austria, the chief family in the empire, or the king of
Spain, or the emperor, who were both formerly of that house, or Germany
itself, is meant; but the empire, as we have seen, seems to be designed
by the earth in the first vial; wherefore, rather as the smiting of the
third part of the sun, moon, and stars, under the fourth trumpet,
signifies the utter extirpation of the Roman emperor, and all other
Roman magistrates, who were the sun, moon, and stars in that empire; so
this vial upon the sun refers to the pope, and his creatures, the
cardinals, &c. who is the sun in the antichristian kingdom; and this
angel may design the kings of the earth, who will be stirred up against
him, by whom he and his dependents will suffer sorely, if not destroyed.

And power was given unto him to scorch men with fire; which may either
respect the burning of Rome, and the adjacent parts; or rather the
filling of the antichristian party with rage and malice, at the
destruction of the pope, and his creatures; for these men are the same
with those in [Rev 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md).

[Revelation 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 16:9</span></span>

And men were scorched with great heat,.... Burned with rage against the
followers of Christ; were filled with envy at the success of his Gospel,
and with fury and madness at the ruinous condition of the antichristian
state, being deprived of its head, and chief officers:

and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues;
plagues or judgments are from God, when and wherever they come; they are
sent and inflicted by him, and he can lessen or increase them, continue
or remove them, as he pleases; and these, unless sanctified, will not
reform men, but harden them, and set them a blaspheming the author of
them. And this blasphemy may either respect the nature and perfections
of God, charging him with inequality in his ways, and with injustice and
unfaithfulness; or the Gospel, and the truths of it, which declare his
glory, and his greatness; and which will now have a general spread, to
the great mortification and confusion of the followers of antichrist:

and they repented not to give him glory; that is, they did not repent of
their wicked deeds, their idolatries, murders, sorceries, fornications,
and thefts, as in [Rev 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020.md) so as to
own and confess them, which is, the meaning of giving glory to God in
repentance; see [Jos 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#019.md). This shows
that repentance is not in man's power, but in the gift of God's grace;
for though he may give space, yet if he does not give grace to repent,
no man will repent; nor will any means of themselves produce it; as not
the most powerful and awakening ministry, as the ministry of John the
Baptist, and of Christ, and of the Gospel preachers that will be in
those times, this vial refers to, nor the greatest mercies and favours,
so not the severest judgments; see [Amo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006.md). The event of this vial, or the
plague of it, is applied, by Mr. Daubuz, to the wars between the
emperors and the popes, and between the Guelphs and Gibelines.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 16:10</span></span>

And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast,....
The beast is the same with that in [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md) and which again shows that to be
one and the same: the seat or throne of the beast is Rome, which, when
the empire was Pagan, was the seat of Satan, or the dragon, [Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md) and when the beast or antichrist
was risen, the dragon gave this seat, as well as his authority to him,
[Rev 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002.md) and is that city which is so
often called, in this book, the great city, and is manifestly pointed
out by its seven mountains, on which the city of Rome stood, [Rev
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#009.md) and the pouring out of this vial
upon it denotes the destruction of it, when it will be burnt down, and
become desolate, an habitation of devils, of every foul spirit, and
hateful bird, [Rev 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002.md) and this
corresponds with the fifth trumpet; for as that brings in the rise of
antichrist, both eastern and western, who rose much about the same time,
so this vial affects him particularly; the western antichrist, his seat
and kingdom. Mr. Daubuz refers this plague to the expulsion of the
western and eastern emperors from their capital cities, Rome and
Constantinople, and to the mischiefs caused by the antipopes in the
west, and to the quarrels and schism in the Greek churches in the
fourteenth century.

And his kingdom was full of darkness; not only of the darkness of false
doctrine and superstition, for so it was always, being filled with the
smoke of the bottomless pit; nor only of judicial blindness and
darkness, which the subjects of the antichristian state are given up
unto; but rather of a discovery of all this, with all their hidden works
of darkness, which will now be brought to light; though it seems chiefly
to design the great affliction and distress the antichristian state will
be in at this time, which darkness sometimes signifies; see [Isa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md) it having lost its sun, the pope,
under the preceding vial, and its seat, the city of Rome, under this:
the sense is, that it will be greatly obscured in its glory and
magnificence, in its traffic and riches, [Rev
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#011.md) its power and authority will be
greatly diminished, and it will be had in contempt by the princes of the
earth; though it will not as yet be utterly destroyed, for its utter
destruction is reserved for the seventh and last vial. The allusion is
to the plague of darkness in Egypt, [Exo
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021.md). And they gnawed their tongues
for pain; these are the men of the antichristian party, the subjects of
the antichristian kingdom, now become full of darkness, the worshippers
of the beast, and his image; these will gnaw their tongues, which
expresses their inward anguish and distress, their anger, wrath, and
fury, their being filled with revenge, and yet in an incapacity to
execute it, and will even be afraid to express it; and therefore will
bite their tongues in madness; and this for pain, for the pain of their
mind, at the sad and low estate of the antichristian kingdom.

And blasphemed the God of heaven,.... Who made it, and dwells in it, and
from whence wrath is revealed, and comes upon the seat of the beast,
upon the kingdom of antichrist, and the subjects of that kingdom; they
will curse him who is of right their King, and their God, and look
upwards to heaven, where he is, [Isa
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#021.md) and this,

because of their pains and their sores: see [Rev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md) the inward frettings and
distresses of their minds, the gallings and gnawings of their
consciences, the horror and terror of their souls, and their fearful
looking for of judgment, which the present face of things upon
antichrist will bring upon them; just as the Egyptians, in the time of
their darkness, were distressed with internal guilt, and black horror of
mind, and with evil spirits, which were sent among them, and haunted
them during that season; see [Psa
78:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#049.md) and repented not of their deeds;
their antichristian works of darkness; see [Rev

And the sixth angel poured his vial on the great river Euphrates,....
Which is not to be understood literally of the river Euphrates, which
ran through Mesopotamia and Chaldea, and by the walls of Babylon; and of
the drying of it up to make way for the Jews in the eastern parts of the
world, to pass into their own land, and possess it; when a like miracle
will be wrought for them as was when they came out of Egypt, by dividing
the Red sea for them; and as when they entered into Canaan's land, by
laying the waters of Jordan on heaps, so that they passed over as on dry
land; in favour of which sense the passage in [Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md) is thought to be, which the
Targum interprets of God's smiting the river Euphrates; though the river
Nile in Egypt seems rather to be meant: but it does not appear that
there is any number of Jews beyond the river Euphrates; the far greater
number of them is in the western and northern parts of the world; so
that there will be no need for the drying up of this river for their
passage into their own land; nor, if there were any in those parts, can
any reason be given why they should be called the kings of the east,
who, wherever they are, are a poor contemptible people, and have never
had any ensigns of royalty among them for many hundreds of years; nor
can that river be thought much to hinder, were all other impediments out
of the way, nor the drying of it up much facilitate their passage to
Judea, and much less affect their conversion: besides, this vial, as the
rest, is a plague on antichrist, in some branch or other, or on some
part or other, of the antichristian state; which, if not designed here,
is nowhere in the account of this vial, and therefore this must be
understood mystically; there is no doubt an allusion to the draining of
this river at the taking of Babylon by Cyrus, according as was predicted
in prophecy, [Isa 44:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#027.md) who, making
sluices and drains, turned the river another way, and marched through it
with his army, and surprised and took the city at once, while Belshazzar
and his nobles were indulging themselves in rioting and drunkenness, as
Daniel relates, [Dan 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001.md). Now some,
because that Babylon was situated upon the river Euphrates, and Rome, or
the Romish antichrist, is mystical Babylon, think that is here designed,
and is the object of this vial; and that the drying up of this river
designs the withdrawing of nations and kingdoms, signified by waters,
[Rev 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md) from its jurisdiction and
power, which will bring on its ruin; and also the stoppage of dues and
tithes, annates, Peter's pence, and of all its traffic in indulgences,
pardons, &c. whereby it will be greatly impoverished, and brought to
nothing: but it should be observed, that the fifth vial affects Rome,
the seat of the beast; and as for the beast himself, he will not be
destroyed till the battle of Armageddon; and mystical Babylon, or the
antichristian state, in the whole compass of it, will not be destroyed
until the pouring out of the seventh vial; wherefore rather the eastern
antichrist, the Turks are meant, in whose dominions this river is; for
as the Assyrian monarch is signified by the waters of this river, when
he was in his glory, and had his seat at Babylon, by which this river
ran, [Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md) so may the Turks, who
inhabit by this river, be intended by it; and the rather, as this sense
exactly corresponds with the sixth trumpet; for as the sounding of that
trumpet looses the four angels bound in the great river Euphrates, which
founded the Turkish empire, as we have seen; so the pouring out of this
sixth vial affects the same empire, and brings it to ruin. Mr. Daubuz is
of opinion that this plague refers to the depopulation and destruction
of the Grecian empire, and the bringing of the Turks into Europe, who
have greatly distressed and tormented the corrupted Christians or
Papists.

And the water thereof was dried up; the Ottoman empire will be extinct,
just as the destruction of the Babylonish monarchy is expressed by the
drying up of its sea, [Jer 51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036.md) so
the destruction of the Turkish empire is signified by the drying up of
the water of this river, which is in the heart of it: and this is the
passing away of the second woe, [Rev
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#014.md)

that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared; which some
understand of Christians in general, who are made kings and priests unto
God, and of Christian kings in particular, whose way will be prepared,
by the declining state of antichrist, to express their hatred to the
whore of Rome, and burn her flesh with fire; but the Romish antichrist
is not here intended: others think, as before observed, that the Jews
are designed; that the Jews will be converted in the last days seems
manifest from [Hos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md) and other
places; and that they will return to their own land is suggested in
abundance of prophecies, particularly in [Eze
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021.md) [Amo
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014.md) and it must be allowed that the
eastern, as well as the western antichrist, is a stumbling to them; and
especially the advantage which the Turks have gained over the powers
that go under the Christian name, and their possession of their land is
an hinderance to their return to it; so that the destruction of the
Turkish empire will undoubtedly make way for their conversion, and
restoration to their own land; but then this will be equally
advantageous to the Jews in the west as to those in the east, if there
be any numbers of them there, which does not appear, and therefore there
seems no reason why they should be pointed at, and be called the kings
of the east: rather therefore to me it seems, that, through the fall of
the Ottoman empire, way will be made for the kings and princes of the
east, literally understood, to have and embrace the Gospel of Christ;
for, the Turks being destroyed, the Mahometan religion will decline, the
Gospel will be carried into the eastern parts of the world, into those
vast kingdoms and countries which lie in those parts, when they will
become the kingdoms of our Lord, and the kings and princes of them will
come to the brightness of Zion's rising; so that the ruin of this
monarchy will pave the way for the spread of Christ's kingdom from sea
to sea, and front the river, the river Euphrates, to the ends of the
earth; and this also will prepare the way, and lead on for all the
saints, who are kings, and shall reign with Christ a thousand years, who
is said to come from the east, [Rev
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002.md) or from the rising of the sun, as
these are said to do, as the words may be rendered, to possess the
kingdom under the whole heaven: Philo the Jew (z) has some expressions
illustrating the literal sense of this, where he speaks of a Roman army
on the banks of Euphrates, which kept the passage of "the eastern
kings".

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 16:13</span></span>

And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs,.... Rome, the seat of
antichrist, being destroyed, and the kingdom of the beast darkened, and
brought into great contempt, Mahometanism greatly declining, the Gospel
succeeding everywhere, the Jews being converted, and resettled in their
own land, the devil bestirs himself more than ordinary; and dispatches
his, and the emissaries of antichrist, to the kings of the whole earth,
that can any ways be engaged on their side, and against the saints; and
these are no other than the creatures of antichrist, such as cardinals,
priests, and particularly Jesuits, as their original from the dragon,
the beast, and the false prophet, show. Mr. Daubuz thinks these "three"
are the "monks", the "religious knights", and "secular clergy": and
these are called "spirits"; not because they are what are called
familiar spirits, or devils themselves, for they are the spirits of
devils, as in the next verse; but either because they pretend to be
spiritual men, ecclesiastics, men in spiritual offices, and indeed are
spiritual wickednesses in high places; or because of their agility,
swiftness, and expeditiousness in going to and fro, Satan like, to do
mischief: and they are said to be "unclean"; as the evil spirits and
devils are, being so by nature, and delighting in uncleanness, and
giving themselves up to work it with greediness: and they are "like
frogs"; the allusion is to the plague of frogs in Egypt, [Exo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#005.md) and these antichristian emissaries
are fitly compared to them, for their impurity, and pleasure they take
in it, as frogs do in dirt and filth; and for their being talkative,
impudent, and troublesome, like the noisy croaking frogs; so
"rhetoricians" are by Cicero (a) compared to frogs; and as the frogs of
Egypt got into the king's bedchamber, [Exo
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#003.md) so these get into the private
retirements of princes, into their cabinet councils, and stir them up to
war and bloodshed: and as for the number, "three", this is only used to
express a sufficient number of them, or to make the account square with
the dragon, beast, and false prophet, from whom they proceed; and
besides, this is omitted in the king's manuscript. Now John saw these,
in a visionary way,

come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast,
and out of the mouth of the false prophet; by the dragon is meant the
devil, [Rev 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009.md) not as acting in Rome
Pagan, which has been long ago destroyed, rather as in the Pagan parts
of the world, and as in the Turkish empire, now ruined; who, seeing his
cause declining everywhere, bestirs himself to support and revive it,
though this issues in the binding of him for a thousand years, [Rev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002.md). By the beast is meant the first
beast, in [Rev 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md) and so the
Ethiopic version renders it; the antichristian civil state, now sadly
shattered and weakened, by the pouring out of the fifth vial: and by
"the false prophet" is meant, not Mahomet, or the supporters of his
religion, but the second beast in [Rev
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011.md) or the antichristian
ecclesiastic state, as appears from the description of this prophet in
[Rev 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md) compared with that: so then
these spirits manifestly appear to be the emissaries of antichrist,
under a diabolical influence; his creatures, that are made, and sent
forth by him, have their commissions and orders from him, to act for him
in every shape, to support his interest, civil and religious, by lies,
murders, and false doctrine; a further account is given of them in the
next verse.

For they are the spirits of devils,.... They are of their father the
devil; they are acted and influenced by him, he works effectually in
them, and leads them captive at his will; they do his lusts, and are
murderers and liars, and false teachers, like him:

working miracles; lying ones, to deceive men; this clearly points out
who are meant, namely, the followers of antichrist, who, as they spread
the doctrines of devils, endeavour to confirm them by signs and lying
wonders:

which go forth unto the kings of the earth: those who have committed
fornication with the Romish antichrist, such of them as will remain:

and of the whole world; as many Pagan princes as they can come at, and
engage by any ways and means in their interest; they will go forth to
them like the lying spirit to Ahab's prophets, [Kg1
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022.md)

to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty; that is,
they will persuade them to gather together, to fight against the saints,
the Gentile Christians in the several parts of the world, and the Jewish
Christians, now settled in their own land; and this will be the battle
of the Lord, who is God Almighty, and it will be fighting against him;
and therefore the attempt must be vain and fruitless, and issue in the
ruin of those who are gathered to it, who will be deceived and drawn
into it by these diabolical spirits: and this is called "the battle of
that great day of God"; not of the day of judgment, for it will be
before that time; but of that day of vengeance upon all the remains of
his and his church's enemies, both Pagan, Papal, and Mahometan, who will
for this purpose be gathered together; "which", as the Ethiopic version
renders it, "God has appointed".

Behold I come as a thief,.... These are the words of Christ, inserted in
a parenthesis in this account, before it is concluded, to acquaint his
people with his near and sudden approach, and to give them a word of
caution and exhortation in these times of difficulty; for he is the Lord
God Almighty, who sent forth these angels to pour out their vials, and
whose judgments are applauded as righteous, [Rev
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md) and who so often in [Rev
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#007.md) says "I come quickly"; and which
is to be understood not of his spiritual coming, which will be already
at this time, but of his personal coming: and which will be "as a
thief": as it is often expressed, [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md) not in the bad sense, to steal and
kill, and to destroy, though Christ's coming will issue in the
everlasting destruction of the wicked; but the phrase is designed to
express the suddenness of his coming, and the surprise of it:

blessed is he that watcheth; against sin, the lusts of the flesh, and
the cares of this life, lest they bring a sleepiness upon him, and so
the day of the Lord come upon him at an unawares; and against Satan and
his temptations, who goes about seeking whom he may devour; and against
his emissaries and false teachers, who lie in wait to deceive; and
blessed is he also who is wishing and waiting for the coming of Christ,
and so, being ready, will enter with him into the marriage chamber, and
partake of the supper of the Lamb:

and keepeth his garments: either his conversation garments, unspotted
from the world, and whenever defiled washes them, and makes them white
in the blood of the Lamb; and keeps them from being stripped of them, by
those who would lead them into sinful ways; or that keeps and holds fast
the robe of Christ's righteousness, and garments of his salvation, which
are the righteousness of the saints, that fine linen clean and white,
that white raiment which only can cover their nakedness, that the shame
thereof does not appear, [Rev 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008.md)

lest he walk naked; (b), "naked of the commandments", or good works,
according to the Jewish phrase; having lost, or dropped his conversation
garments:

and they see his shame; or lest, being naked, he be exposed to shame and
confusion, yea, to everlasting ruin and destruction; see [Mat
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012.md) the allusion is to the burning
of the garments of those priests who were found asleep when upon their
watch in the temple: the account that is given is this (c);

"the man of the mountain of the house (the governor of the temple) goes
round all the wards (every night) with burning torches before him; and
in every ward where the person does not stand upon his feet, the man of
the mountain of the house says to him, peace be to thee; if he finds he
is asleep, he strikes him with his staff, and he has power to burn his
clothes; and they say (in Jerusalem) what voice is that in the court?
(it is answered) the voice of a Levite beaten, and his clothes burnt,
because he slept in the time of his watch; R. Eliezer ben Jacob says,
once they found my mother's brother asleep, and they burnt his
clothes:''

now imagine with what shame the poor Levite so served must appear the
next morning among his brethren, with his clothes burnt, and he naked;
and with greater shame and confusions must he appear at the last day
that is destitute of the righteousness of Christ.

And he gathered them together,.... Or rather "they gathered them
together", as the Syriac version renders it; for though the verb is
singular, a noun plural goes before it, as in [Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014.md) and the same spirits that are
there said to go forth, to gather the kings gether, these will gather
them together; will persuade the Papal, Pagan, and Mahometan powers, the
remains of them in the several parts of the world, to join together, and
make one effort for the reviving of their declining, and almost ruined
interests: for which purpose they will be brought together,

into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon; which may be the
same with Har-megiddo, the mountain of Megiddo; for the Hebrew word is
read "Ar" by the Greeks; so the city Argarize is interpreted the
mountain of the most High (d): and this refers either to the slaying of
Josiah in the valley of Megiddo, which occasioned such mourning, that it
became proverbial for any great sorrow; see [Ch2
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#022.md) where it is called the valley of
Megiddon; or rather to the slaughter of Sisera's army at the waters of
Megiddo, by Barak, [Jdg 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md)
suggesting that the same would be the fate of these united powers. Some
derive the word from and which signify "the destruction of their
troops", or "armies"; and so designs not any place, that has been or is,
but which will be so called from the issue of this battle; and since it
is an Hebrew name that will be given it, it may lead us to conclude it
will be somewhere in Judea, and very likely no other than the valley of
Jehoshaphat, where all nations will be gathered; and which is called the
valley of decision, where will be the day of the Lord, and multitudes
will be slain, [Joe 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md) though the
name will suit any place where there will be a defeat of these enemies;
but this vial only brings them together; the utter destruction of them
is reserved for the next.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 16:17</span></span>

And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air,.... Or "upon the
air", as the Alexandrian copy, Syriac and Arabic versions, read; by
which is meant the kingdom of Satan, he being the prince of the power of
the air, [Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md) not that he has
power over the air, to raise or lay winds and storms in it at pleasure;
but he is so called because he is the prince of that posse of devils,
the principalities and powers of darkness, that have their dwelling in
the air; hence the air, encompassing the whole earth, stands for the
kingdom of Satan all the world over: and this vial differs from all the
rest; that whereas the rest only affect some part or branch of the
antichristian state, this will affect all the remains of the Pagan,
Papal, and Mahometan powers, gathered and united together at Armageddon;
and the pouring out of this vial is the execution of divine wrath and
vengeance upon them all at once; and the effects of this vial will not
only reach to the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, and their
armies, or the united forces of the remains of Pagans, Papists, and
Mahometans, who will be slain, and their flesh given to the fowls of the
air; and not only to the beast and false prophet, who will be taken in
this battle, and cast alive into the lake of fire, which is expressive
both of their temporal and eternal punishment, [Rev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md) but to the binding of Satan upon
the second coming of Christ, of which notice is before given, [Rev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015.md) and even to the destruction of
Gog and Magog at the end of the thousand years' reign; yea, to the
casting of the devil into everlasting fire, since this vial is the last
plague, in which the wrath of God is filled up, and so brings to the end
of all things, [Rev 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001.md). The first
accomplishment of this vial will be the decisive battle at Armageddon,
when the remains of all Christ's and his church's enemies will have a
total defeat; and this will be the third and last woe, which will
utterly destroy those that have destroyed the earth, Pagans, Papists,
and Mahometans, even all the open enemies of Christ, so that nothing
will lie in the way of his kingdom; now will the spiritual reign of
Christ, which has been gradually advancing by the pouring out of each
vial, be in its full glory: but though antichrist will be no more, and
Satan will have no more in form an open kingdom upon earth; yet, towards
the close of this reign, great lukewarmness and coldness will seize
professors of religion, and immorality and profaneness will abound
again; which will bring on the times of the coming of the son of man;
who, upon his personal descent from the third heaven into the air, will
drive Satan and his posse of devils from their territories, and quickly
will the general conflagration begin, when the heavens shall pass away
with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; and
which is no inconsiderable part of the pouring out of this vial into the
air.

And there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the
throne; this voice is said to come "out of the temple of heaven", that
is, out of the temple which is in heaven, which will now be opened, as
under the sounding of the seventh trumpet, with which this vial
corresponds, and indeed is contemporary; and which designs the church,
enjoying the pure worship of God, the word and ordinances, and the free
exercise of religion; and this shows that when this voice will be
uttered, as yet the Jerusalem church state will not be begun, since
there will be no temple in that; see [Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md) the words, "of heaven", are left
out in the Alexandrian copy, and in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and
Ethiopic versions, which read, "out of the temple from the throne"; the
seat of government in the church, described in [Rev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002.md) the voice came with power,
authority, and majesty; not from any of the four and twenty elders, or
four living creatures, or angels about the throne; but either from God
the Father that sits upon it; or from Christ the Lamb in the midst of
it, and rather from the latter, since a like phrase was used by him on
the cross, [Joh 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#030.md) and the same is
expressed by him who is the Alpha and Omega, [Rev
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006.md) and this voice is called a great
one, being the voice of a great person, the King of kings, and coming
with great power, and was spoken aloud:

saying, it is done; what the angel swore should be in the days of the
seventh angel, namely, that time, antichristian time, should be no more,
and the mystery of God in his purposes and providences should be
finished, and all the glorious things spoken of his church and people be
accomplished; See Gill on [Rev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006.md),
[Rev 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007.md) the word may be rendered "it
has been", or "it was", and the sense is, but now is not; and the
meaning may be, Babylon was, but is not, it is now fallen; the beast and
false prophet were, but now are not; the Turk, or Mahomet, was, but is
no more; all the antichristian powers are destroyed; Christ's body, the
church, will be completed, the Jews will be converted, and the fulness
of the Gentiles brought in, all the elect called, and the new Jerusalem
prepared as a bride for her husband; and when the utmost effects of this
vial will take place, the end of all things will be; by the same "fiat"
that made the heavens and the earth, they will disappear, and new
heavens and earth succeed in their room.

[Revelation 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 16:18</span></span>

And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings,.... As at the
giving of the law, [Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md) and at
the sounding of the seventh trumpet; see Gill on [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md) and may intend either the pure
ministry of the Gospel in the spiritual reign, the voices of Christ's
ministers, and the effects of them, who will be "Boanergeses", sons of
thunder, and will be the means of enlightening the minds of many, as
well as of shaking the consciences of men, signified by the earthquake
following; or rather, the tremendous and awful judgments of God upon the
remains of the antichristian party, as the very great commotions and
changes that will be made in the world are expressed in the next clause:

and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon
the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great: for as the changes
made in the Jewish state, civil and ecclesiastical, are signified by the
shaking of the heavens and the earth, and as the fall of Paganism is
expressed by an earthquake, and the fall of the tenth part of the city
is the effect of another; so the destruction of all the antichristian
powers, and the mutations made in the earth thereby, are designed by
this; see [Heb 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md) [Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016.md). Mr. Daubuz applies the whole of
this vial to the, Reformation, when such a revolution was made in a
short time, as has not been known since the world was, or men became
worshippers of the beast; at which time Christendom was divided into
three parts, the eastern or Greek church, the western or Latin church,
and the reformed churches.

[Revelation 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 16:19</span></span>

And the great city was divided into three parts,.... By which is meant
not Christendom, distinguished into Protestants, Papists, and neutrals,
which has been long the case; nor the city of Jerusalem, as inhabited by
Christians, Jews, and Turks; nor the city of Rome itself, the seat of
the beast, which will have suffered under the fifth vial; but the whole
Romish jurisdiction, which is the great city, that reigns over the kings
of the earth, as it will now be; though some think the Turkish empire is
meant, which they suppose was only afflicted under the preceding vial,
but will now be divided into three parts, and afterwards into six, [Eze
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001.md) and so come to ruin; and others
are of opinion that it is included in this great city at least; and
doubtless the remains of it are to be taken into this account, and
probably are considered in the following clause; wherefore it is better
to understand this of the Romish jurisdiction, so often called the great
city in this book, [Rev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md) and its
division into three parts is either in reference to the three heads of
it, the dragon, beast, and false prophet, or to the three unclean
spirits that come out of them, which will lead on to this ruin; though
the allusion seems rather to be to the destruction of Jerusalem, [Eze
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md) and denotes the utter ruin of the
Romish antichrist, in all its branches and remains; a tenth part of this
city will fall towards the close of the sixth trumpet, [Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013.md) and now all the other nine parts
will fall, a threefold division will be made of the city, each division
containing three parts: the Jews (e) have a prophecy, that upon an
appearance of a star at Rome, which they suppose will be when the
Messiah comes, the three upper walls of that city will fall, and the
great temple, or church (St. Peter's), will fall, and the governor of
that city (the pope) will die:

and the cities of the nations fell; of the Pagans and Mahometaus; or as
there will be an utter extirpation of the Papacy, so of Paganism and
Mahometanism, in the several nations where they have obtained, and where
there will be now any remains of them;

and great Babylon came in remembrance before God; not Constantinople, as
Brightman thinks, because that Rome, the seat of the beast, is affected
under the fifth vial, and the great city under this; but since no other
is called Babylon in this book but the Romish antichristian state, it
must be meant here; see [Rev 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md) for
many hundreds of years Babylon seemed to be forgotten by God, no notice
being taken of her sins and iniquities in a judicial way; but now God
will remember her sins, [Rev 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#005.md) and
inflict deserved punishment upon her:

to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath; as
a just retaliation for the wine of her fornication, with which she has
intoxicated the kings and inhabitants of the earth; the wrath of God is
sometimes signified in the Old Testament by a cup, a wine cup, a wine
cup of fury, see [Psa 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md) and here
the exceeding greatness of his wrath is expressed by the phrases used,
and intends the pouring out of all his vengeance, to the utter ruin of
the Romish antichrist.

[Revelation 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 16:20</span></span>

And every island fled away,.... This may be understood either of the
dissolution of the world, the present heavens and earth, when there will
be no more sea, [Rev 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md) and so
consequently no islands:

and the mountains were not found; for the earth and the heaven will be
fled away at the appearance of Christ the Judge, and there will be no
place found for them, [Rev 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011.md) and
new heavens, and a new earth, without sea or mountains, will succeed: or
rather this may signify the utter extirpation of all the antichristian
powers in every shape, whether on islands or on the continent; for this
day of the Lord will be upon every high mountain and hill, to bring them
low, and the Lord alone shall be exalted, [Isa
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#014.md) and may particularly respect the
dissolution of monasteries, and the plundering them of their riches and
revenues.

[Revelation 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 16:21</span></span>

And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven,.... Which must be
understood not as after the fall of the cities, and the flight of the
islands and mountains, but at the same time; and it looks as if such men
that shall escape at the battle of Armageddon, that hail stones from
heaven will fall upon them and destroy them; just as the kings of the
Amorites and their men were killed by hail stones, cast down by the Lord
from heaven, as they fled before Joshua, when more were killed by the
stones than were slain by the sword, [Jos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md) the allusion seems to be to the
plague of hail in [Exo 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#023.md)

every stone about the weight of a talent; which is threescore pound
weight, a prodigious weight indeed for a single hailstone! such hail
stones were never known to fall; the largest I have read of is what
Caspar Wesserus assured Mr. Broughton (f) of, at Zurich, which being
brought from a field afar off, to the consul, and so must melt in
carriage, yet weighed a pound. It may be said of this hail storm, as of
the earthquake in a preceding verse, that it will be such as never was
since men were upon earth; and denotes the sore, heavy, and even
intolerable judgments of God upon the antichristian party: God's
judgments are sometimes signified by hail storms, [Isa
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md) and particularly the judgments
upon Gog and Magog, [Eze 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022.md) which
may respect the same as here: the Jews (g) now expect a great hail in
the times of Gog and Magog:

and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; the plague of
hail brought down the hard heart of Pharaoh, and humbled him, so that he
acknowledged his wickedness, and the sin of his people, and owned the
justice of God; but this more terrible storm will have no effect upon
these men, to convince and reform them, but, on the contrary, they will
break out into blasphemy against God, who caused it to fall on them; it
will have the same effect as the fourth and fifth vials:

for the plague thereof was exceeding great; it must beat down all before
it, and be intolerable: whether this hail storm may not also have some
regard to coldness and lukewarmness, as Naplet suggests, and so may
point at the close of the spiritual reign of Christ, or the Laodicean
state, which will bring on the second coming of Christ, and so this
effect of the seventh vial will end where the seven churches and seven
trumpets do, may be considered; See Gill on [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md).
