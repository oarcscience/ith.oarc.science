### [Isaiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 10:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO ISAIAH 10

This chapter contains denunciations of punishment, first on the
governors of the Jewish nation, and then upon the Assyrians; a woe is
denounced on the makers and imposers of bad laws, whereby the poor and
the needy, the widows and the fatherless, were deprived of their right,
[Isa 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md) which woe or punishment is
explained to be a desolation of their country by the Assyrians, that
should come afar off, and which they could not escape; under whom they
should bow and fall; and yet there should not be an end of their
punishment, [Isa 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003.md) next follows a
prophecy of the destruction of the Assyrians themselves, for the comfort
of God's people; in which is observed, that the Assyrian monarch was an
instrument in the hand of the Lord to chastise his people, and therefore
is called the rod and staff of his wrath and indignation, [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md) the people are described against
whom he was sent, and the end for which is mentioned, [Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md) though this was not his
intention, nor did he design to stop here, but to destroy and cut off
many other nations, [Isa 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md) which he
hoped to do from the magnificence of his princes, who were as kings, and
from the conquests he had made of kingdoms, and their chief cities, [Isa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008.md) wherefore, when the Lord had done
what he designed to do by him among his people the Jews, he was
determined to punish him, because of the pride of his heart, and the
haughtiness of his looks, and his boasting of his strength and wisdom,
and of his robberies and plunders, without opposition; which boasting
was as foolish as if an axe, a saw, a rod, and a staff, should boast,
magnify, move, and lift up themselves against the person that made use
of them, [Isa 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md) which punishment
is said to come from the Lord, and is expressed by leanness, and by a
consuming and devouring fire; for which reason his army is compared to
thorns and briers, to a forest, and a fruitful field, which should be
destroyed at once; so that what of the trees remained should be so few
as to be numbered by a child, [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md) and, for the further consolation
of the people of God, it is observed, that in the times following the
destruction of the Assyrian monarchy, a remnant of the people of Israel
should be converted, and no more lean upon an arm of flesh, but upon the
Lord Christ, the Holy One of Israel; even a remnant only; for though
that people were very numerous, yet a remnant, according to the election
of grace, should be saved, when it was the determinate counsel of God,
and according to his righteous judgment, to destroy the far greater part
of them, for their perverseness and obstinacy, [Isa
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020.md) wherefore the people of God are
exhorted not to be afraid of the Assyrian, though chastised by him;
since in a little time the anger of the Lord would cease in his
destruction, which should be after the manner of the Egyptians at the
Red sea, and as the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; whereby
they would be free from his burden and yoke, because of the anointed
King that should reign, or the King Messiah, [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md) and then follows a description
of the expedition of the king of Assyria into Judea, by making mention
of the several places through which he should pass with terror to the
inhabitants, until he should come to Jerusalem, against which he should
shake his hand, [Isa 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md) and then,
under the similes of lopping a bough, and cutting down the thickets of a
forest, and the trees of Lebanon, is predicted the destruction of his
army and its generals by an angel, [Isa
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033.md).

[Isaiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 10:1</span></span>

Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees,.... Or, "O ye that
decree", &c. being a sign of the vocative case, and an interjection of
calling, as Aben Ezra observes; though the Targum and other versions
understand it of a threatening denounced; and is to be understood as
lying against lawgivers and judges, political rulers and governors of
the people, that made unrighteous laws; laws which were not agreeable to
the law of God, nor right reason; and were injurious to the persons and
properties of men; and which were calculated for the oppression of good
men, especially the poor, and for the protection of wicked men, who made
no conscience of spoiling them:

and that write grievousness which they have prescribed; laws grievous
and intolerable being made by them, they wrote them, or ordered them to
be written, to be engrossed and promulgated, published them, and obliged
the people to be subject to them. This some understand of the scribes of
judges, who sat in court, and wrote out the decrees and sentences made
by them; but it rather intends the same persons as before; and not
ecclesiastical but political governors are meant, and such as lived
before the Babylonish captivity; or otherwise the whole is applicable to
the Scribes and Pharisees, to the Misnic doctors, the authors of the
oral law, the fathers of tradition, whose decisions and decrees were
unrighteous and injurious, and contrary to the commands of God; heavy
burdens, and grievous to be borne, and very oppressive of the poor, the
fatherless, and the widow; for which they are reproved by Christ, [Mat
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#003) Jarchi says it is an Arabic (g.md)
word, which signifies scribes.

\(g\) So and Scriba, Golius, col. 1999; so the word is used in the
Chaldee and Syriac languages. See Castel. col. 1828, 1829.

[Isaiah 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 10:2</span></span>

To turn aside the needy from judgment,.... Such laws being made as
discouraged them from any application for justice; and, when they did,
were harassed with such long, vexatious, and expensive suits, as obliged
them to desist, and the cause being generally given against them, and
for the rich:

and to take away the right from the poor of my people; for not to do
justice to the poor is the same as to rob and plunder them, and take
away by force what of right belongs to them; wherefore it follows:

that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless; who
have none to protect and defend them, and whose protectors judges ought
to be, in imitation of God, whom civil magistrates represent, who is the
Judge of the widows and the fatherless; and therefore this is observed
as an aggravation of their sin, which was very great indeed: it is very
wicked in a judge to pervert the judgment of the poor and needy, the
widow and the fatherless, contrary to laws that are made by God and men;
but to make and prescribe wicked and unrighteous laws, that wickedness
may be framed, and mischief committed by a law, that the poor and the
needy, the widows and fatherless, may be injured under colour and
pretence of law and justice, is the height of injustice. See [Psa
94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020.md).

[Isaiah 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 10:3</span></span>

And what will ye do in the day of visitation,.... Not in a way of grace
and mercy, but of wrath and anger, as the following clause explains it,
when God should come and punish them for their sins; and so the Targum,

"what will ye do in the day that your sins shall be visited upon you?''

it designs the Babylonish captivity, as the next words show; the same
phrase is used of the destruction of the Jews by the Romans, [Luk
19:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#044.md),

and in the desolation which shall come from far? from Assyria, which was
distant from the land of Judea: the word (h) for "desolation" signifies
a storm, tumult, noise, and confusion; referring to what would be made
by the Assyrian army, when it came upon them:

to whom will ye flee for help? Rezin king of Syria, their confederate,
being destroyed; and Syria, with whom they were in alliance, now become
their enemy, see [Isa 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#011.md),

and where will ye leave your glory? either their high titles, and
ensigns of honour, as princes, judges, and civil magistrates, which they
should be stripped of; or rather their mammon, as Aben Ezra interprets
it, their unrighteous mammon, which they got by perverting the judgment
of the poor and needy, the widow and the fatherless, of which they
gloried; and which now would be taken away from them, when they should
go into captivity.

\(h\) "sub procella, quae a longinquo veniet", Cocceius; so the Targum
renders it, "in tumult of tribulation".

[Isaiah 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 10:4</span></span>

Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall
under the slain,.... That is, either, being forsaken by me, and
destitute of my help, they shall bow down; or, "because they are without
me", are not my people, and do not hearken to me, therefore they shall
bow down, so David Kimchi; or, were it not for me, they would, as
others; or that they might not bow down and fall; and so the words may
be connected with the preceding verse [Isa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003.md), others render the word,
translated "without me, besides"; and the sense is either, as Moses
Kimchi, besides their bowing in their own land, when subdued by the
Gentiles, a greater affliction shall befall them, captivity; when they
should be either carried captive or slain; or besides him that shall bow
down under the prisoners, they shall fall under the slain; besides those
that are taken, others shall be killed; or none shall escape, but, or
"except", him that bows, and hides himself under the prisoners, or in
the place of the slain, that he might not be thought to be alive: or the
sense is, the desolation shall be so general, that none shall escape,
either they shall be taken prisoners, or they shall be slain; agreeably
to which Noldius (i) renders the words, "without me", everyone "shall
bow down among the prisoners, or shall fall among the slain"; which
gives the best sense of them; that, being left of God for their sins,
they would either be bound and carried captive, or else slain with the
sword, and one or the other would be the lot of everyone of them:

for all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out
still; the final and utter destruction of the nation of the Jews being
then not yet come, when carried captive to Babylon, there remained a
greater calamity for them, to come by the hands of the Romans. These
first four verses [Isa 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md) seem more
properly to belong to the preceding chapter [Isa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md), and this should begin with the
next verse [Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md).

\(i\) Ebr. Concord. Part. p. 201, 771.

[Isaiah 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 10:5</span></span>

O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger,..... Either as calling him to come
against the land of Israel to spoil it, so Kimchi; or as grieving that
he was obliged to make use of him in such a manner against his people;
or as threatening him with ruin. So the Targum, Septuagint, and all the
Oriental versions render it, "woe to the Assyrian"; wherefore this, and
what follows, serve to comfort the people of God; that though they
should be carried captive by the Assyrians, yet they should be utterly
destroyed, and a remnant of the Jews should be saved. The Assyrian
monarch is called the "rod of God's anger", because he was made use of
by him as an instrument to chastise and correct Israel for their sins:

and the staff in their hand is mine indignation; that is, the staff
which was in the hand of the king of Assyria, and his army, with which
they smote the people of Israel, was no other than the wrath and
indignation of God against that people, and the execution of it, which
he committed to them as instruments. Kimchi interprets "their hand" of
the land of Israel, into which this staff was sent, the Assyrian, to
smite and chastise them. The Targum is,

"woe to the Assyrian, the government of my fury; and an angel sent from
before me against them for a curse.''

[Isaiah 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 10:6</span></span>

I will send him against a hypocritical nation,.... The people of Israel,
who might well be called so, since everyone of them was a hypocrite,
[Isa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017.md) pretending to love, fear,
and serve the Lord, when it was only outwardly, and by profession, and
not in deed, and in truth; their character contains the reason of the
Lord's calling and sending the Assyrian to correct and chastise them:

and against the people of my wrath: who provoked him to wrath, were
deserving of it, and upon whom he was about to bring it; it was their
hypocrisy that stirred up his wrath against them; nothing is more
hateful to God than that:

will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey: that
is, the Assyrian monarch, to make a spoil and a prey of the people of
the Jews, not by any legal commission, or express command, but by the
secret power of his providence, guiding and directing him into the land
of Judea, to ravage and spoil it:

and to tread them down like the mire of the streets: which denotes the
great subjection of the inhabitants of it to him; the very low and mean
estate into which they should be brought; the great contempt they should
be had in; the little account that should be had of them; and their
inability to help and recover themselves.

[Isaiah 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 10:7</span></span>

Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so,.... His
purposes, intentions, and thoughts, were not as the Lord's; he did not
imagine that he was only the rod of his anger, and the staff of his
indignation, a minister of his wrath, and the executioner of his
vengeance; he thought he was his own lord and master, and acted by his
own power, and according to his own will, and was not under the
direction and restraints of another; his intention was not to chastise
and correct the people of the Jews, but utterly to destroy them, and not
them only, but many other nations; as follows:

but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations, not a few; not
the nation of the Jews only, but many others, and so establish an
universal monarchy; and what flushed him with hope and expectation of
success were the magnificence of his princes, and the conquests he had
already made.

[Isaiah 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 10:8</span></span>

For he saith, are not my princes altogether kings? Meaning either the
kings which he had conquered, which were become his princes and
subjects; or rather, such were the greatness and glory of his nobles,
that they were equal in their riches and dominions to kings, and so were
able to furnish him with men and money for such an expedition he had in
his heart to undertake, even to conquer and subdue all the nations of
the earth: and this he said either to his people, boasting of his
grandeur; or in his heart, as Kimchi observes, to encourage himself; or
rather more openly before others, in order to discourage and inject
terror into the nations he meant to destroy, and particularly the
inhabitants of Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 10:9</span></span>

Is not Calno as Carchemish?.... Jarchi's note is,

"as the children of Carchemish are princes and rulers, so are the
children of Calno;''

as if this was giving an instance of the grandeur of his subjects; but
much better is the Targum,

"as Carchemish is subdued before me, shall not Calno be so?''

as I or my ancestors have conquered the one, it is as easy for me to
conquer the other; or as sure as the one is subject to me, so sure shall
the other be; for Carchemish was a city belonging to the Assyrians,
situated upon the river Euphrates, [Ch2
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020) called by Ammianus (k.md)
Circusium; the Syriac version calls it Barchemosh; and Calno is the same
with Calneh in the land of Shinar, a city built by Nimrod, [Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010.md) in the Septuagint version it is
called Chalane, and it is added,

"where the tower was built;''

from whence the country, called by Pliny (l) Chalonitis, had its name,
the chief city of which was Ctesiphon, thought to be the same with
Calneh.

Is not Hamath as Arphad? Hamath and Arphad were both cities conquered by
the Assyrians; see [Kg2 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#034.md) and are
both mentioned along with Damascus, [Jer
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023.md).

Is not Samaria as Damascus? Damascus was the metropolis of Syria, and
was taken by the Assyrians; and Samaria was the metropolis of Ephraim,
or the ten tribes; see [Isa 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md) and
was as easy to be taken as Damascus was. The Targum is,

"as Arphad is delivered into my hands, shall not Hamath be so? As I have
done to Damascus, so will I do to Samaria.''

[Isaiah 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 10:10</span></span>

As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols,.... Which worship
idols, as the Targum paraphrases it. He speaks of them as being very
easily taken by him; he had no trouble in subduing them; no sooner did
he come up to them, and looked on them, and saw where they were, but
they fell into his hands; they gave up themselves to him at once, and he
took possession of them.

And whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
being made of better metal, or more richly ornamented, or worshipped in
a more pompous manner; or were "more" than they of Jerusalem and
Samaria, exceeded them in number; or were "stronger" and mightier than
they, as Kimchi supplies it, and yet could not protect them; or were
"from Jerusalem, and from Samaria"; the wicked men of Israel, Jarchi
says, supplied all the nations with images, they all sprung from them;
and if the idols which came from hence could not secure the nations of
the earth from falling into the hands of the Assyrian monarch, neither
could they preserve Jerusalem and Samaria from being taken by him.

[Isaiah 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 10:11</span></span>

Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria, and her idols,.... Kimchi
observes, that what is said in the preceding verses was said before
Samaria was taken, but this after it was taken:

so do to Jerusalem, and her idols; he had taken Samaria, and carried the
ten tribes captive, and now his eye was upon Judah and Jerusalem; and
such was his insolence, impiety, and blasphemy, that he reckons the true
God, whom the Jews worshipped, among the idols of the Gentiles, and upon
a level with them, if not inferior to them, especially to his own idol,
and thought himself superior to him.

[Isaiah 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 10:12</span></span>

Wherefore it shall come to pass,.... It shall surely be; what God has
purposed in his heart, and published in his word, shall certainly be
fulfilled:

that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon Mount Zion, and on
Jerusalem; in correcting, chastising, and humbling the inhabitants
thereof, by suffering them to be besieged by the Assyrian army. God
sometimes makes use of wicked men to chastise his people; this is his
work, and not theirs; and when he begins, he goes on, and finishes it;
and when he has done, punishes the instruments he uses; after he has
scourged his children, he takes the rod, and breaks it to pieces.

I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and
the glory of his high looks; that is, he would punish him for his wicked
actions, which were the fruit of the haughtiness of his heart, and the
pride of his eyes; or for that pride which filled his heart, and showed
itself in his lofty looks. Kimchi joins this to the preceding clause,
and makes the sense to be, that God would punish the Assyrian for his
pride, in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; for there his army died, or near
it, being smitten by the angel. The Targum is,

"and it shall be, when the Lord hath finished to do all that he hath
said in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem.''

[Isaiah 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 10:13</span></span>

For he saith, by the strength of my hand I have done it,.... Meaning
either that by the power of his army, which was under his command, or by
his own personal valour, he had subdued kings, taken their kingdoms and
chief cities, and ascribes nothing to the power aud providence of God;
and if such arrogance and haughtiness, in things of a civil nature, is
an instance of vanity, and is resented by the Lord, then much more such
conduct in things of a religious nature, when men ascribe regeneration,
conversion, and salvation, to the power of their free will, and to the
works of their hands, and not to the power and grace of God:

and by my wisdom, for I am prudent; attributing his conquests partly to
his power, and partly to his skill and prudence in marshalling his army,
making use of stratagems to decoy the enemy, and get an advantage of
him; whereas strength and power, and so wisdom and prudence, are from
the Lord; as he gives safety, victory, and salvation to kings, so he
teaches their hands to war, and their fingers to fight; which they ought
to acknowledge, and will, unless vain and proud:

and I have removed the bounds of the people; by subduing kingdoms, and
adding them to his own, so that they were no more distinct governments;
and by transplanting the inhabitants of them to other places, and making
new colonies and settlements; and so the Targum,

"and I have removed the people from province to province:''

taking that to himself which belongs to God, who has determined the
times before appointed, and the bounds of men's habitations:

and have robbed their treasures: laid up in palaces, temples,
sepulchres, and private houses, for time to come, which are usually
plundered when cities and towns are taken; the Targum renders it,

"their laudable cities:''

and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man; from their
greatness, from their seats of honour and dignity; or I have put down
many inhabitants, as Jarchi, and reduced great numbers to a low and mean
estate. The Targum is,

"I have brought down with strength they that dwell in fortified
places;''

and so Aben Ezra and Kimchi explain it, they that dwell in a strong
place or palace.

[Isaiah 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 10:14</span></span>

And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people,.... With that
ease as a man finds a nest of birds, and takes them:

and as one gathereth eggs that are left; by the bird, who not sitting
upon them, there is none to protect them; whereas, when they are sat
upon by the bird, she will flutter with her wings, and strike with her
bill, and preserve them as well as she can:

have I gathered all the earth; the kingdoms and inhabitants of it, there
being none to resist, or that dared to do it, as follows:

and there was none that moved the wing; as a bird will do, when its
young or eggs are taken away from it:

or opened the mouth, or peeped; chattered, clucked, or expressed any
grief, uneasiness, or resentment; the Targum is,

"that opened his mouth, and spoke a word.''

[Isaiah 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 10:15</span></span>

Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?....
Hitherto are the words of the Assyrian monarch; and here begin the words
of the prophet, rebuking him for his pride, and deriding his vain
boasting, in attributing that to himself, to his wisdom and power, who
was but an instrument, which belonged to God, the sole Governor and wise
orderer of all things; which was all one as if an axe should ascribe the
cutting down of trees to itself, and insist on it that the man that cut
with it had no share in the action, nor was it to be ascribed to him;
than which nothing is more absurd. The sense is, that the king of
Assyria, in taking cities, and conquering kingdoms, and adding them to
his own, was only an instrument in the hand of God, like an axe in the
hand of one that hews down trees; and therefore it was vain and
ridiculous to take that to himself which belonged to the Lord, on whom
he depended as an instrument, as to motion, operation, and effect; from
whom he had all power to act, all fitness for it, and efficacy in it, as
the axe has from the person that makes and uses it, or any other
instrument, as follows:

or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? or draws it
to and fro; which is the sense of the Targum, Septuagint, and Vulgate
Latin versions, and others; and which further exposes the vanity and
arrogance of the Assyrian monarch, who had no more concern in the
spoiling of nations, and destruction of kingdoms, than the saw has in
cutting of timber that is hewn; which has its form, its sharp teeth, not
of itself, but from the maker; and when thus made, and fit for use,
cannot draw itself to and fro, and cut trees in pieces, which are felled
by the axe, but must be moved by another; and to insult the mover of it,
as if it was not his act, but its own, is not more absurd than what this
haughty prince was guilty of, in boasting of his power, wisdom, and
prudence, in the above mentioned things:

as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up (m); for
such was the king of Assyria, he was no other than the rod of the Lord's
anger, [Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md) and which he lifted
up, and with it chastised his people; wherefore for him to behave
haughtily against the Lord, and arrogate that to himself which was the
Lord's doing, was as if a rod should shake itself against him that lifts
it up; or, "as if a rod should shake those that lift it up": as if there
were more power in the rod than in them that take it up and strike with
it; yea, that even the rod moves them, and not they the rod, which is
wretchedly absurd:

or, as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood (n);
but something more than wood, an animate creature, a rational agent,
whereas it is nothing else but wood; or "as if a staff should lift up"
itself against that which is "not wood", like itself, but is a man, that
can move himself and that too; or "as if a staff should lift up" that
which is "not wood"; attempt to bear, carry, move, and direct that which
is not material like itself, but is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, even
the almighty God. De Dieu thinks that is not a verb, but a noun of the
plural number, of "a mountain": and renders it, "as if a rod should
shake those that lift it up: and as if a staff were mountains, and not
wood". The Targum is,

"when a rod is lifted up to smite, it is not the rod that smites, but he
that smites with it.''

The sense is, that the Assyrian monarch was only a rod and staff in the
hand of the Lord, and only moved and acted as used by him; whereas,
according to his vain boast, he was the sole agent, and all was done by
his own power and prudence; and was so far from being moved and directed
by the power and providence of God, that he was the director of him;
which is infinitely more absurd than the things instanced in.

\(m\) Ben Melech observes, that this is to be understood of the blessed
God; and the word being in the plural number, it is the same way, of
speaking as in Josh. xxiv. 19. "the Holy Gods is he".

\(n\) Gussetius thinks this clause contains an ironical answer to the
above questions, "shall the axe boast itself?" &c.; "shall the saw
magnify itself?" &c.; they should, "as the rod should shake itself" &c.;
just in like manner as that does, and so by lifting up itself, ceases to
be wood; and which being sarcastically spoken, carries in it a strong
negative, that the axe and saw should not glory, or magnify themselves,
and no more should the king of Assyria. Vid. Comment. Ebr. p. 360.

[Isaiah 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 10:16</span></span>

Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts,.... Because of the pride,
and arrogance, and vain boasting of the Assyrian monarch, which was
resented by the Lord, he is threatened with what follows; and in order
to humble him, and to show that God is above him, these titles are used;
"the Lord", the Lord of the whole earth, and the King of kings, and Lord
of lords; "the Lord of hosts", of armies above and below, of more and
greater armies than what the king of Assyria was lord of; and therefore
he might be assured that what is hereafter threatened would be
fulfilled, namely,

send among his fat ones leanness; the Targum is, among his princes, who
abounded in riches and honour; or his army, and the chiefs in it, the
mighty and strong; and by "leanness" is meant destruction and death,
which came upon his army, and the great men of it, immediately from the
hand of God; see [Psa 106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015.md) compared
with [Num 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#033.md),

and under his glory he shall kindle a burning, like the burning of a
fire; that is, under his army, which was great and glorious, very
numerous, and well accoutred with clothes and arms, and made a very
splendid and glittering show, and of which the Assyrian monarch gloried;
this army the Jews say was destroyed by fire, and that the bodies of the
men were burnt, and their clothes untouched; but Jarchi interprets this
glory of their garments, which give a man glory, and says these were
burnt; the Targum calls them their vessels of glory; perhaps meaning
their glittering arms, which were burnt along with them.

[Isaiah 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 10:17</span></span>

And the light of Israel shall be for a fire,.... That is, the Lord, who
is the light of his people; who enlightens them by his word and Spirit,
and by his grace effectually calls them out of darkness into marvellous
light, to the light of grace here, and to the light of glory hereafter;
and who comforts and refreshes them with his gracious presence, and with
the light of his countenance when in affliction and distress, which is
sometimes signified by darkness; and the same Lord, who is as light to
his people, and gives light and comfort to them, is as a consuming fire
to others:

and his Holy One for a flame; that is, the Holy One of Israel, the God
of Israel, who is holy in himself, and the sanctifier of others; the
Syriac version reads, "his Holy Ones": so Jarchi observes it as the
sense of some, that the righteous of that generation are meant; the
Targum is,

"and there shall be the Lord, the light of Israel, and his Holy One; and
his word strong as fire, and his word as a flame;''

see [Jer 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md) so Jarchi interprets it
of the law Hezekiah studied:

and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day; the
Targum interprets it, his rulers and governors; and so Jarchi, his
princes and mighty men; the chief in the Assyrian army, called briers
and thorns, because mischievous and hurtful, and caused grief; but
rather the multitude of the common soldiers is designed, who were all
destroyed in one night, [Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md) by
an angel; who, according to Aben Ezra, is the light and Holy One of
Israel here spoken of.

[Isaiah 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 10:18</span></span>

And shall consume the glory of his forest,.... The Assyrian army is
compared to a "forest", for the number of men in it; and for the mighty
men in it, comparable to large and tall trees, such as oaks and cedars;
and like a wood or forest a numerous army looks, when in rank and file,
in proper order, and with banners, and having on their armour, their
shields, spears, bows and arrows; and the "glory" of it intends either
the princes and nobles that were in it, the principal officers,
generals, and captains; or the riches of it, the plunder of the
Egyptians and Ethiopians, as Kimchi observes, which were all destroyed
at once:

both soul and body, or "from the soul even to the flesh" (o); which
denotes the total consumption of them, nothing of them remaining; the
Targum is,

"the glory of the multitude of his army, and their souls with their
bodies, it shall consume;''

and so some understand this of the eternal destruction of soul and body
in hell: the Rabbins are divided about the manner of the consumption of
the Assyrian army; some say their bodies and souls were both burnt,
which these words seem to favour; and others, that their souls were
burnt, and not their bodies, their lives were taken away, and their
bodies unhurt; which they think is favoured by [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md) where it is said, "under his
glory", and not "his glory" (p):

and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth; who when he fails,
the whole company or army is thrown into confusion, and flees; and so
the Targum,

"and he shall be broken, and flee.''

Some render it, "as the dust of the worm that eats wood" (q); so Jarchi;
signifying that they should be utterly destroyed, and become as small as
the dust that falls from a worm eaten tree; which simile is used, a
forest being made mention of before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 10:19</span></span>

And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few,.... Which were
left unconsumed, that escaped this destruction, those of the Assyrian
army that fled with Sennacherib their king; which, the Rabbins say (r),
were no more than ten, as Jarchi and Kimchi observe; yea, some say there
were but five left who escaped, and name them, Sennacherib and his two
sons, Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuzaradan:

that a child may write them; count them, and take down their names; and
it may be understood of a military muster, and the sense be, that the
army should be reduced to so small a number by this stroke upon them,
that there would be no need of an able muster master to take the account
of them, a child would be equal to such a task. The Targum is,

"and the rest of his warriors shall fail, that the people shall be a
small number, and shall be reckoned a weak kingdom.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 10:20</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day,.... Here begins a prophecy
relating to the people of Israel, and concerns things that should befall
them after the destruction of the Babylonish monarchy, which after
Nebuchadnezzar did not last long; there were but two kings after him
mentioned in Scripture, Evilmerodach, and Belshazzar; so that its tall
trees, its kings, were very few, so few that a child might count them;
and what is after said is for the comfort of that people, and seems to
refer to the times of the Gospel, as appears by some words in the
context cited by the Apostle Paul:

that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of
Jacob; who should return from the Babylonish captivity, and be settled
in their own land:

shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; either on the kings
of Egypt, who were originally their oppressors, and in whom they had
been so foolish as to put their trust and confidence, they being but a
broken staff and reed, [Isa 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002.md) or on
the king of Assyria, in the time of Ahaz, who made him pay tribute, and
afterwards fought against him:

but shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth; that is,
upon Christ, the Lord of all, and King of saints; the Lord their
righteousness, and from whom they have their holiness: to stay or lean
on him is expressive of faith in him, of reliance and dependence on him,
and trust in him; which is done in sincerity and uprightness of soul,
unfeigned and without dissimulation; not in profession only, but in
reality, and as nakedly revealed in the Gospel, without type and figure;
for this respects Gospel times, in which the shadows of the law are
gone, and Christ, as the object of faith, appears unveiled, being come a
High Priest of good things to come. The Targum is they

"shall no more lean on the people whom they served; but they shall lean
upon the Word of the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth;''

that is, on the essential Word, the Messiah: this was the case of a few
of them, a remnant according to the election of grace, as the following
words show.

[Isaiah 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 10:21</span></span>

The remnant shall return,.... This is said in allusion to Shearjashub,
the name of Isaiah's son, [Isa 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md)
which signifies "the remnant shall return", and was imposed on him, to
give assurance of it; meaning, either that they should return from the
Babylonish captivity, as they did, or to God by repentance; or rather
the sense is, they shall turn to the Lord, be converted to Christ, to
the faith and obedience of him, as some of them were when he came, a
few, not all, only a remnant, as it is explained in the next clause:

even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God; the Messiah, so called,
[Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md). The Targum is,

"the remnant which have not sinned, and are turned from sin; the remnant
of the house of Jacob shall return to worship before the mighty God.''

[Isaiah 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 10:22</span></span>

For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,.... These words
are spoken either by the Lord to the prophet, calling Israel his people;
or by the prophet to Hezekiah, as Jarchi and Kimchi think; or they may
be rendered thus, "for though thy people, O Israel, be as the sand of
the sea" (s); that is, innumerable, as was promised to Abraham, [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md),

yet a remnant of them shall return; or "be converted in it" (t), to the
Messiah; or "be saved", as the apostle interprets it; see Gill on [Rom
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md); a remnant is a few, as Kimchi
explains it, out of a great number: it signifies, that the majority of
the Jewish nation should reject the Messiah, only a few of them should
believe in him; and these should certainly believe in him, and be saved
by him; and that for the following reason, because

the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness; that is, the
precise and absolute decree, concerning the salvation of the remnant,
God will cause to overflow, or abundantly execute, in a righteous
manner, consistent with his divine perfections; and so it makes for the
comfort of the remnant of the Lord's people, agreeably to the intent of
the apostle's citation of it; see Gill on [Rom
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028.md); though some understand it of
God's punitive justice, in consuming and destroying the greater part of
the Jewish people, the ungodly among them, and saving a remnant, which
return and repent; and to this sense are the Targum, and the Jewish
commentators.

[Isaiah 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 10:23</span></span>

For the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption,.... Not of the land
of Judea, as at the destruction of Jerusalem; but the meaning is, that
he that is Lord of all, who does what he pleases in the armies above and
below, will execute and accomplish a precise and absolute decree of his,
concerning the salvation of the remnant of his people; which is his
decree of election, and that standing sure, not upon the foot of works,
but his own sovereign will: hence their salvation is sure and certain,
and not precarious;

even determined, in the midst of all the land; that is, the determined
decree should be executed in the several parts of the land of Judea,
where this remnant was; for which reason the Gospel was preached in the
several cities of Judah, in order to accomplish it, both by Christ and
his apostles.

[Isaiah 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 10:24</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts,.... Since there is such a
decree, and this will certainly be executed:

O my people, that dwellest in Zion; the inhabitants of Jerusalem; such
of them especially as feared the Lord, and worshipped him, and served
him in the temple:

be not afraid of the Assyrian: the king of Assyria; neither Sennacherib,
that threatened them with ruin, having taken the cities of Judah, and
laid siege to Jerusalem; nor Nebuchadnezzar, who carried them captive,
since he would not be able utterly to destroy them, they would return
and dwell in the land again; for there was a decree concerning the
salvation of a remnant, which would certainly take place; and till that
was executed, it was impossible the nation should be destroyed.

He shall smite thee with a rod; be an instrument of chastising and
correcting, but not of destroying; Jarchi interprets it of smiting with
the rod of his mouth, by means of Rabshakeh reproaching, and
blaspheming:

and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt;
which Kimchi explains of the tribute the Assyrians exacted of them, in
like manner as the Egyptians set taskmasters over them, and afflicted
them with hard bondage, in Egypt: the sense is, that though the
Assyrians should annoy and distress them, yet should not utterly consume
them; there would be an end of their oppression, and a deliverance out
of it; even as when they were in Egypt, and oppressed there, the Lord
appeared for them, and supported them, and at length saved them, and so
he would now. Mention is made of a rod and a staff, in allusion to what
the Assyrian is said to be in the hand of the Lord, [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md).

[Isaiah 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 10:25</span></span>

For yet a very little while,.... Within a few days; for in a very short
time after Sennacherib was come up against Jerusalem his army was
destroyed by an angel:

and the indignation shall cease; the indignation of the Lord against his
people Israel, shown by bringing the Assyrian monarch against them, of
which he was the staff or instrument, [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md),

and mine anger in their destruction; not in the destruction of the Jews,
but the Assyrians: the sense is, that the anger of God towards the
people of the Jews for the present should be discontinued, when the
Assyrian army was destroyed. The Targum is,

"for yet a very little while, and the curses shall cease from you of the
house of Jacob; and mine anger shall be upon the people that work
iniquity, to destroy them;''

that is, the Assyrians.

[Isaiah 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 10:26</span></span>

And the Lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him,.... The Assyrian
monarch; this scourge stirred up or awakened by the Lord, with which
that monarch was severely scourged, is no other than the angel that was
sent of God to destroy his army, [Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md),

according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: this refers to
the destruction of the Midianites in the time of Gideon; and suggests,
that the slaughter of the Assyrians should be like that, as it was; for
as that was in the night, and very general, and immediately from the
hand of the Lord, and was unthought of, and unexpected, and such of
their princes that fled were taken and slain, particularly Oreb, at the
rock which took its name from him; for not mount Horeb, and the rock
there smitten by Moses, are meant, which is written with different
letters; see the history of this in [Jdg
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#019.md) so it was in the night when the
Assyrian army was destroyed, and that wholly; and not by the Israelites,
but by the Angel of the Lord; and at once, at an unawares; and though
Sennacherib fled and escaped, he was slain by his own sons, in his own
city, in the temple of his god, [Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md),

and as his rod was upon the sea; referring to Moses's rod, which was
lifted up, by the order of the Lord, over the Red Sea, when the
Egyptians were drowned:

so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt; and destroy the
Assyrians, in like manner as he destroyed the Egyptians, all at once.

[Isaiah 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 10:27</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken
away from off thy shoulder,.... The tax or tribute imposed upon Hezekiah
by the king of Assyria, [Kg2 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md),

and his yoke from off thy neck; the same with the burden; unless it
means also the subjection of the cities of Judah, which were taken by
the Assyrian; and indeed it may be extended further, and be considered
as a prophecy not merely of deliverance from the present distress, but
from the future captivity in Babylon; and which was a type of the
deliverance and redemption by Christ, when the Lord's people were
delivered from the burden of sin, the guilt and punishment of it; from
the yoke of the law, the yoke of bondage; and from the tyranny of Satan,
and out of the hand of every enemy; and this seems to be hinted at in
the next clause:

and thy yoke shall be destroyed, because of the anointing; or, "be
corrupted, because of fatness" (u); through the multitude of riches and
honours, with which the Assyrian monarchy abounded; which fill with
pride, introduce luxury, and so bring ruin, on a state. Jarchi and
Kimchi interpret the anointing of Hezekiah, the anointed king of Israel,
for whose sake the Assyrian yoke was destroyed. The Rabbins say, that
this deliverance was wrought on account of the large quantity of oil
which Hezekiah consumed in the schools and synagogues, for the study of
the law, and the explanation of it; but the Targum much better refers it
to the Messiah,

"the people shall be broken from before the Messiah;''

who was anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows, and for
whose sake, and by whom, the yoke of sin, Satan, and the law, has been
destroyed. Vitringa interprets it of the Spirit of God, and his powerful
operations, whose gifts and graces are often compared to oil and
ointment; and makes the words parallel to [Zac
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006.md).

He is come to Aiath,.... In this and the following verses is
prophetically described the expedition of Sennacherib to Jerusalem, when
he either went from Assyria, or returned from Egypt thither; and the
several places are mentioned, through or by which he passed, or near to
which he came, the tidings of which greatly distressed the inhabitants
of them; and the first that is named is Ajath, thought to be the same
with Ai, which was beside Bethaven, and on the east side of Bethel, [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md) and though it was burnt, and made
desolate by Joshua, [Jos 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028.md) yet it
was afterwards rebuilt, for it was in being in Nehemiah's time; or at
least there was a place of this name, which was upon or near the spot
where this stood, since it is mentioned with Geba, Michmash, and Bethel,
[Neh 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#031.md) according to the ancient
Jewish writers (w), it lay three miles from Jericho. Jerom (x) calls it
Agai, and says that in his time there was scarce any remains of it, only
the place was shown.

He is passed to Migron; this place, as the former, was in the tribe of
Benjamin; mention is made of it, as in the uttermost part of Gibeah,
[Sa1 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#002.md). Sennacherib seems not to
have stayed either in this, or the former place:

at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages; here was a passage, called
the passage of Michmash, where was the garrison of the Philistines; and
on each side of it were two rocks, one called Bozez, and the other
Seneh; one of which fronted Michmash to the north, and the other Gibeah
to the south, [Sa1 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023.md) by Josephus
(y) it is called Mechmas, a city; and so it is in the Apocrypha:

"Thus the sword ceased from Israel: but Jonathan dwelt at Machmas, and
began to govern the people; and he destroyed the ungodly men out of
Israel.'' (1 Maccabees 9:73)

In Jerom's time it was a very large village, who says it was nine miles
from Jerusalem (z): mention is made of it in the Misna (a), as famous
for the best fine flour; and this the king of Assyria made his magazine,
and in it laid up his provisions and warlike stores, from whence he
might be supplied upon occasion. The words may be rendered, "he hath
laid up his arms"; and Kimchi thinks he left the greatest part of his
arms here, and went in haste to Jerusalem, imagining he should have no
occasion for them, but should easily take it. The Targum is,

"at Micmas he shall appoint the princes of his army;''

the generals of it: perhaps the sense is, that here he made a muster of
his army, examined the arms of his soldiers, appointed the proper
officers, and gave them their instructions.

Jordan, as the Targum; but rather of Michmash, [Sa1
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023.md) this to be understood of the
king of Assyria with his army:

they have taken up their lodging at Geba; or "Geba was their lodging";
that is, for a night only; not that they continued here for any time, as
our version seems to suggest. This was a city in the tribe of Benjamin,
[Jos 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017.md) called Geba of Benjamin,
[Kg1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022.md).

Ramah is afraid; the inhabitants of it, as the Targum, at the report of
the march of the king of Assyria and his army, and their being near to
them. Ramah was in the tribe of Benjamin, [Jos
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025.md) it is mentioned with Gibeah in
[Hos 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md) upon which place Jerom says
it was seven miles from Jerusalem; but elsewhere (c) he says it was but
six, and was to the north against Bethel. See [Jdg
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#013.md).

Gibeah of Saul is fled; that is, the inhabitants of it fled, upon
hearing the king of Assyria with his army was coming that way. This was
also a city of Benjamin, and is called Gibeah of Benjamin, [Sa1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md) and Gibeah of Saul, [Sa1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#004.md) as here; either because he was
born there, as Jerom (d) affirms; and certain it is, that he was of the
tribe of Benjamin; or because he built it, or at least a palace in it to
dwell in, as Kimchi thinks; and it is plain he dwelt here, for it is
called his home, [Sa1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#026.md) the name
of the place with Josephus (e) is Gabathsaoula, which he makes to be
thirty furlongs or four miles from Jerusalem, and says it signifies
"Saul's hill", and that it was situated in a place called the Valley of
Thorns.

Lift up that voice, O daughter of Gallim,.... In a mournful and
lamentable manner, and yet with such a clear loud voice, as to be heard
afar off: the word is sometimes used for making a joyful sound, and of
the neighing of horses. The inhabitants of Gallim are meant by its
daughter; of this place was Phalti, who married Michal, Saul's daughter;
very probably it was in the tribe of Benjamin. Jerom (f) makes mention
of Accaron, a village, which was called Gallim.

Cause it to be heard unto Laish; if this was the place the Danites took,
and called it Dan, it was on the northern border of Judea, in the
furthermost part of the land; hence the phrase, from Dan to Beersheba;
it was near to Caesarea or Paneas, from whence the river Jordan took its
rise; and was a great way off, either of Gallim or Anathoth, for the
voice of them to be heard.

O poor Anathoth! this was a city in the tribe of Benjamin, [Jos
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#018.md) it was the native place of the
Prophet Jeremiah, [Jer 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md) according
to Josephus (g), it was twenty furlongs from Jerusalem; and, according
to Jerom (h), three miles: it is called "poor", because it was but a
poor mean village; or because it would now become so, through the
ravages of the Assyrian army.

Madmenah is removed,.... That is, the inhabitants of it, who removed
from thence upon hearing that the Assyrian army had invaded the land,
and was coming up to Jerusalem. There was a place called Madmannah,
which lay in the southern part of the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031) which, Jerom (i.md) says, was then
called Memris, and was near the city of Gaza; but whether the same with
this is not certain.

The inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee; of this place we
have no account any where. Hillerus (k) thinks the whole name of the
city was Joshebehaggebim, which we render "the inhabitants of Gebim";
and supposes it had its name from the ditches that were in it, or about
it.

[Isaiah 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">isa 10:32</span></span>

As yet shall he remain at Nob that day,.... The same day he came from
Gebim; and proceed no further as yet, but make a short stay, and prepare
himself and army to march to Jerusalem the next day: the Jews say (l),
that he performed all his journeys in one day; the same day he came to
Ajath he came to Nob, where he stayed the remaining part of the day. Nob
was a city of the priests, [Sa1 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#019.md)
and so it is called in the Targum here; it was so near Jerusalem, that,
as Jarchi and Kimchi say, it might be seen from hence; wherefore here he
stood, in sight of Jerusalem; against the wall of it, the Targum says;
and did as follows:

he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the
hill of Jerusalem; threatening what he would do to it, and despising it
as unable to hold out against him; or the sense is this, yet a day, or
in a day's time, from the last place where he was; he shall come to Nob,
and there shall he stop, and go no further: or, "the mountain of the
daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem, shall shake its hand"; bidding
him defiance, insulting over him, or rejoicing at the fall of the
Assyrian army. Wherefore it follows:

[Isaiah 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">isa 10:33</span></span>

Behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall lop the bough with
terror,.... Cut off the king of Assyria and his army, in a most terrible
manner; "the glory" of it, as in [Isa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018.md) the word signifies that which is
the ornament, the beauty and glory, of the tree. The Septuagint render
it, "the glorious ones"; and the Arabic version, "the nobles", the
generals, and principal officers of the army; the Targum is,

"behold, the Lord of the world, the Lord of hosts, shall cast forth the
slain in his camp, as grapes that are trod in a winepress.''

And the high ones of stature shall be hewn down; the princes of Assyria,
so boasted of as kings, [Isa 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008.md)
comparable to tall trees, to oaks and cedars:

and the haughty shall be humbled; who, like their monarch, boasted of
their wisdom and strength, [Isa 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md)
but now both he and they will be brought very low.

[Isaiah 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">isa 10:34</span></span>

And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,.... The
multitude of the common soldiers, the whole body of the army, by means
of one of his angels, that excel in strength, for which he is compared
to "iron"; and which is explained in the next clause:

and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one; the Assyrian army is compared to
the forest of Lebanon, for the multitude of trees in it, and the
tallness of its cedars, it abounding not only with common soldiers, but
with great men; so it is compared to a forest, and to Carmel, or a
fruitful field, in [Isa 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018.md) and the
Assyrian monarch is said to be a cedar in Lebanon, [Eze
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md) which fell by the hands of one of
the mighty angels, [Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md) some,
because of this last clause, think that this and the preceding verse
[Isa 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033.md) are to be understood of the
calamities that should come upon the Jews, at the time of the Babylonish
captivity; for though Sennacherib should stop at Nob; and proceed no
further, however should not be able to take Jerusalem, yet hereafter a
successor of his should; and, according to this sense, by the "bough"
lopped may be meant Jeconiah, or Zedekiah king of Judah; by the "high
ones of stature", and the "haughty" ones, his children, the princes of
the blood, and the nobles of the land; and by the "thickets of the
forest", the common people, who were either killed or carried captive;
and by Lebanon, the temple, [Zac 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001.md)
and by the "mighty one", Nebuchadnezzar that burnt it. And some of the
ancient Jews interpret this last clause of the destruction of the temple
by Vespasian; they observe upon this passage in one place (m), there is
no mighty one but a king, as in [Jer
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md) and there is no Lebanon but the
house of the sanctuary, according to [Deu
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#025.md) wherefore when a certain Jew
saluted Vespasian as a king, and he replied that he was no king, the Jew
made answer, if thou art not a king, thou shall be one; for this house
(meaning the temple) shall not be destroyed but by the hands of a king,
as it is said, "and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one" (n).
