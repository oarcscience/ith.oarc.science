[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 15:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 15

David, having prepared a place for the ark of God, gathered the
Israelites, Levites, and priests, to assist in the bringing of it up
thereunto, [Ch1 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001) and which was
done in a very honourable and joyful manner, [Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024), though David, for his
behaviour, was despised by Michal his wife in her heart, [Ch1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#029).

[1 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 15:1</span></span>

And David made him houses in the city of David,.... With the help of the
masons and carpenters Hiram sent him, [Ch1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001), the royal palace is meant, with
all the apartments in it, which were many and large, as so great a
family he had required, and with all the out houses to it necessary for
his servants, and their offices:

and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent; see
[Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017).

[1 Chronicles 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 15:2</span></span>

Then David said,.... Either within himself, or to his ministers and
courtiers about him:

none ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites; he saw his former
mistake in employing those that were not Levites in bringing up the ark
from Kirjathjearim, and bringing it in a cart, and not on the shoulders
of the Levites, and so miscarried in his attempt, [Sa2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001) and, perhaps, had since more
diligently consulted the law of God about this matter:

for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister
unto him for ever; as long as the Levitical dispensation lasted, as
appears from [Num 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#050).

[1 Chronicles 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 15:3</span></span>

And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem,.... The chief and
heads of the people:

to bring up the ark of the Lord; from the house of Obededom, where it
had been three months, and for the sake of which his house was blessed,
and which David heard of; and this encouraged him to take this step to
fetch it from thence: unto his place, which he had prepared for it; [Ch1
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 15:4</span></span>

And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites. Whose
business it was to bear the ark when there was any occasion for it: and
from hence to the end of [Ch1 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#010) an
account is given of the Levites, and their number employed in this
affair:

of the sons of Kohath; a son of Levi, that is, of his posterity; for his
immediate sons, and so those of the rest after mentioned, had been dead
ages ago; the principal of those, at this present time, was Uriel, and
his kindred, or those of the same family with him, were one hundred and
twenty: of those of Merari, another son of Levi, the chief was Asaiah,
with two hundred and twenty of his relations: of those of Gershon,
another son of Levi, was Joel, and his brethren were one hundred and
thirty: of the posterity of Elizaphan, a grandson of Kohath, [Exo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#018), the most noted was Shemaiah, who
had two hundred of his family with him: and of those of Hebron, the son
of Kohath, [Exo 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018), Eliel was the
most famous, and he had eighty of his kindred with him: and of those of
Uzziel, another son of Kohath in a different line from Elizaphan, who
also was a son of Uzziel, was Amminadab the chief, who had one hundred
and twelve of his kindred with him: the number of Levites, in all,
gathered together, were eight hundred and sixty two, besides their
chiefs.

[1 Chronicles 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 15:11</span></span>

And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests,.... See [Sa2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017).

and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel,
and Amminadab; the six chiefs before mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 15:12</span></span>

And he said unto them, ye are the chief of the fathers of the
Levites,.... Of the families of the Levites, heads of their fathers'
houses:

sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren; respectively under each,
whose numbers are before given, by washing their bodies and clothes, and
abstaining from their wives:

that you may bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place
that I have prepared for it; [Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017).

[1 Chronicles 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 15:13</span></span>

For because ye did it not at the first,.... Did not sanctify themselves,
as the supplement in our version directs; but rather the sense is, ye
were not there at first, when the ark was brought from Kirjathjearim as
far as the house of Obededom, as they should have been; they were not
then employed, as was their business, and therefore

the Lord our God made a breach upon us; by smiting Uzzah with death, who
was no Levite, and touched the ark, which is called his "error", and for
which God smote him, [Sa2 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#007) on which
place Lud. Capellus observes, the word "shal", we there render "error",
signifies a "disease" in the Arabic language, and might formerly design
a sudden one with the Hebrew; as an apoplexy; and so the sense be, that
God smote Uzzah with an apoplexy, of which he suddenly died:

for that we sought him not after the due order; but, instead of
employing the Levites to carry the ark on their shoulders, it was put
upon a cart.

[1 Chronicles 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 15:14</span></span>

So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves,.... As they were
ordered, and in the manner they should:

to bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel; for though it was chiefly
the work of the Levites, yet the priests might do it, and sometimes did,
see [Jos 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#013).

[1 Chronicles 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 15:15</span></span>

And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
shoulders, with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded, according to the
word of the Lord. Not only bare it on their shoulders, but with the
staves in it, which rested on their shoulders, see [Num
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009), the reason of this command, that
the ark should be carried on men's shoulders, and not in any carriage,
according to Maimonides (h), was both for the honour of it, and lest its
form and structure should be any ways damaged.

\(h\) Moreh Nevochim, par. 3. c. 45. p. 479.

[1 Chronicles 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 15:16</span></span>

And David spake to the chief of the Levites,.... The six before
mentioned, [Ch1 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#011).

to appoint their brethren to be the singers; before the ark, as they
brought it up:

with instruments of music, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals; which
were used in those times, see [Sa2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005).

sounding by lifting up the voice with joy; the instrumental music was to
be attended with vocal music, and that very sonorous and loud, and
performed with all tokens of inward joy and gladness, as the occasion
required.

[1 Chronicles 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 15:17</span></span>

So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel,.... The grandson of
Samuel the prophet, [Ch1 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033).

and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; a famous singer, often
mentioned in the Psalms, [Ch1 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039).

and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; the
same with the son of Kishi, [Ch1 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044),
these were the chief of the singers.

[1 Chronicles 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 15:18</span></span>

And with them their brethren of the second degree,.... Who were next
unto them, both in office and skill in singing:

the fourteen following, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth,
and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah,
and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters; who,
when they were not employed in singing, were doorkeepers of the
sanctuary; either they had been porters at the tabernacle in Gibeon, or
were so after the ark was placed in the tabernacle David prepared for
it.

[1 Chronicles 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 15:19</span></span>

So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan,.... The three principal of
them: these were appointed

to sound with cymbals of brass; for as there were three sorts of musical
instruments, [Ch1 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016) these three
chief singers had one of those instruments appropriated to them, one of
which were the cymbals of brass, to which the apostle alludes, [Co1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 15:20</span></span>

And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and
Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah,.... Who were eight of the second
degree; Aziel is the same with Jaaziel, [Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018) and Ben is left out, in whose
room Azaziah, in the next verse, seems to be put; Ben is thought to be
sick or dead before they came to execute their office, and whom the
father of Kimchi takes to be the same with him who is expressed in the
title of [Psa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001) which title is, "on
Muthlabben", or the death of Ben: these were appointed to sound

with psalteries on Alamoth; psalteries were another kind of instruments
of music; and Alamoth was either the beginning of a song, to the tune of
which those instruments played, or the tune itself, and the note of it;
either the treble or counter tenor, a shrill sound, like that of organs,
which this word sometimes signifies, see [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 15:21</span></span>

And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel,
and Azaziah,.... These six were appointed to sound:

with harps on the Sheminith to excel; which Sheminith some take to be an
harp with eight strings, or the beginning of a song, or a musical tone,
the bass; see the title of [Psa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 15:22</span></span>

And Chenaniah chief of the Levites was for song,.... But the chief for
the song were Heman, Asaph, and Ethan; rather

for the burden, as the Targum; for the lifting up and bearing the ark:

he instructed about the song; or about the taking up and bearing the
burden, the ark; directing when to take it up, and how far to go with
it, and then rest:

because he was skilful; a wise and prudent man in all things, and so
proper to direct in this business.

[1 Chronicles 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 15:23</span></span>

And Berechiah, and Elkanah, were doorkeepers for the ark,.... Either
while it was at Kirjathjearim, and at Obededom's house; or rather after
it was put in the tabernacle David had prepared for it; though it may be
best of all to understand it, that those, as it was carrying, went
before it, to keep the people from pressing to it, and gazing on it.

[1 Chronicles 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 15:24</span></span>

And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the
trumpets before the ark of God,.... With the silver trumpets; one use of
which was to blow with when the camps and ark of the Lord moved, [Num
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#005).

and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark; they went behind
it, as the others before it, for the same purpose, as it was bringing
up.

[1 Chronicles 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 15:25</span></span>

So David and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands,....
He and the principal men of the nation, and the officers of the army or
militia:

went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of
Obededom with joy; with all demonstrations of it; for which purpose such
a band of music was prepared, as before described.

[1 Chronicles 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 15:26</span></span>

And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of
the covenant of the Lord,.... Not merely granted them bodily strength to
carry it, which did not require a great deal; but helped them to carry
it with cheerfulness, and without fear, and so as to commit no error,
nor in any respect provoke his displeasure, as when it was brought
before from Kirjathjearim:

that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams; by way of thanksgiving,
besides what David offered; and this was done by the way, see [Sa2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013).

[1 Chronicles 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 15:27</span></span>

And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen,.... For though a king,
he, being among the singers, was clothed as they; for so it follows:

and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah
the master of the song; or of those that bore the burden, the ark, as
the Targum:

with the singers; all were clothed in robes of fine linen:

David also had upon him an ephod of linen; which he had besides his
linen robe, and was over it; and being a shorter and tighter garment, it
bound the other closer to him; though some think this is explanative of
the former, and designs the same, and is what others, besides priests,
were, on occasion, allowed to wear, see [Sa1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018).

[1 Chronicles 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 15:28</span></span>

Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with
shouting,.... See [Sa2 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015).

[1 Chronicles 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 15:29</span></span>

And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the
city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul, looking out at a
window,.... Of the palace, to see the procession, see [Sa2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016) where not only this circumstance
is related, and the inward contempt she had David in, because of his
behaviour, but also what she said, and what David returned in answer to
it.
