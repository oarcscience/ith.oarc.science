INTRODUCTION TO 1 KINGS

This, and the following book, properly are but one book, divided into
two parts, and went with the Jews under the common name of Kings. This,
in the Syriac version, is called the Book of Kings; and in the Arabic
version, the Book of Solomon, the Son of David the Prophet, because it
begins with his reign upon the death of his father; and, in the Vulgate
Latin version, the Third Book of Kings, the two preceding books of
Samuel being sometimes called the First and Second Books of Kings, they
containing the reigns of Saul and David; and in the Septuagint version
both this and the following book are called Kingdoms, because they treat
of the kingdom of Israel and Judah, after the division in the times of
Rehoboam, son of Solomon, and of the several kings of them; as of
Solomon before the division, so afterwards of the kings of Judah;
Rehoboam, Abijam, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, Ahaziah, Jehoash, Amaziah,
Uzziah or Azariah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon, Josiah,
Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah; and of the kings of
Israel, Jeroboam, Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Zimri, Omri, Ahab, Ahaziah, Jehu,
Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam the son of Joash, Zachariah, Shallum,
Menahem, Pekahiah, Pekah, and Hoshea; so that these books may, with
great propriety, be called the books or histories of the kings in the
two kingdoms of Judah and Israel: who they were written by, is not easy
to say; some think they were written by piecemeal by the prophets that
lived in the several reigns successively, as Nathan, Ahijah the
Shilonite, Iddo, Isaiah, and Jeremiah, and afterwards put together by an
inspired writer. The Jews commonly say (a), that Jeremiah wrote the book
of the Kings, by which they mean this, and the following book; though
very probably they were written by Ezra, since the history in them is
carried down to the liberty granted to Jehoiachin in Babylon; but that
Ezra was the writer of all the preceding historical books, and even of
the Pentateuch, cannot be admitted, which is the conceit of Spinosa (b);
part of whose tract is just now republished by somebody, word for word,
under a title as in the margin (c); but that Ezra was not the writer of
the Pentateuch is clear, since he refers to it as written by Moses, and
as the rule of religion and worship in his times, [Ezr
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md); and it is certain these writings
were in being in the times of Josiah, Amaziah, Joash, yea, of David, and
even of Joshua, [Ch2 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#014.md); and as for
the book of Joshua, that also was written long before Ezra's time; it
must be written long before the times of David, before the Jebusites
were expelled from Jerusalem, since the writer of it says, that they
dwelt there in his days, [Jos 15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063.md);
the book of Judges must be written before the times of Samuel and David,
since the former refers to the annals of it, [Sa1
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#009.md); and the latter alludes to some
passages in it, [Psa 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md); see [Jdg
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004.md); and a speech of Joab's, [Sa2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#021.md), shows it to be an history then
extant: to which may be added, that in it Jerusalem is called Jebus,
[Jdg 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#010.md); which it never was, after
it was taken by David out of the hands of the Jebusites, [Sa2
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md); the book of Ruth very probably
was written by Samuel; had it been of a later date, or written by Ezra,
the genealogy with which it concludes, would doubtless have been carried
further than to David: the Book of Samuel, and particularly the song of
Hannah in it, were written in all probability before the penning of the
hundred thirteenth psalm, [Psa 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md),
in which some expressions seem to be taken from it wherefore, though the
two books of Kings may be allowed to be written or compiled by Ezra, the
ten preceding ones cannot be assigned to him: however, there is no room
to doubt of the divine authority of these two books, when the honour our
Lord has done them is observed, by quoting or referring to several
histories in them; as to the account of the queen of Sheba coming to
hear the wisdom of Solomon; of the famine in the times of Elijah; and of
that prophet being sent to the widow of Sarepta, and of the cleansing of
Naaman the Syrian in the times of Elisha, [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042.md) from [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md) [Kg2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#010.md); to which may be added, the
quotations and references made by the apostles to passages in them, as
by the Apostle Paul in [Rom 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002.md) from
[Kg1 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#014.md) where this book is
expressly called the Scripture; and by the Apostle James, [Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017.md); who manifestly refers to [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md); and there are various things in
this part of Scripture, which are confirmed by the testimonies of
Heathen writers, as will be observed in the exposition of it. The use of
these books is to carry on the history of the Jewish nation, to show the
state of the church of God in those times, and his providential care of
it amidst all the changes and vicissitudes in the state; and, above all,
to transmit to us the true genealogy of the Messiah, which serves to
confirm the Evangelist Matthew's account of it.
