INTRODUCTION TO EZEKIEL

This book is rightly placed after Jeremiah; since Ezekiel was among the
captives in Chaldea, when prophesied; whereas Jeremiah began to prophesy
long before that captivity, and concerning it. The name of this prophet
signifies, as it is commonly interpreted, "the strength of God", or
"strengthened by God", as he was, and as he needed to be, having great
work to do, and a perverse people to deal with; see [Eze
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008); but the learned Hillerus (a.md)
chooses to render it, "God shall prevail"; with which compare [Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md). There was a Levite of this name,
of whom mention is made in [Ch1 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#016.md);
whose name is there read "Jehezekel"; and this prophet was a priest,
[Eze 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003.md); and both Clemens
Alexandrinus (b) and Eusebius (c) cite a Jewish writer of tragedies, of
the same name; which some have very wrongly thought to be the same with
our prophet; but whether Ezekiel is not the same with Nazaratus or
Zabratus, the master of Pythagoras, mentioned by Clemens as such,
according to the opinion of some, is a matter of question; and which the
learned Selden (d) seems to think probable. According to the judgment
and opinion of Jerom (e), his style is neither very eloquent, nor very
rustic; but between both, and has a mixture of each. The visions he saw
are very abstruse and difficult of interpretation, especially the vision
of the living creatures and wheels; wherefore the Jews (f) forbad the
reading of it, as well as the end of this prophecy, until persons were
thirty years of age. The divine visions in this book, the whole subject
matter of it, its agreement with the prophecy of Jeremiah, and the
accomplishment of events predicted in it, prove the authority of it; and
its divine authority has always been allowed, both by the Jewish
synagogue and the Christian church. There were indeed some ancient
Jewish Rabbins, who were perplexed about some things in it, and
consulted about laying it aside, because of some words in it, which
seemed to them to be contrary to the law of Moses; but R. Chananiah ben
Goron, a very famous doctor in those times, withdrew to his chamber, and
wrote a commentary, in order to remove those difficulties to
satisfaction (g). This book, in general, contains various visions the
prophet saw; several threatenings against the people of the Jews; and
prophecies against other nations; and an abundance of comfortable
promises of the Messiah, and of blessings of grace by him; and of the
state and condition of the Gospel church, and the worship of it.
Josephus (h) says Ezekiel left two books written by him; one of which
Athanasius (i): or the author of the Synopsis under his name, thinks is
lost; but the learned Huetius (k) is of opinion that the prophecy of
Ezekiel, in the times of Josephus, was divided into two parts; the first
containing the first thirty nine chapters, and the other the nine last
chapters; which is not improbable. If the authorities of Epiphanius (l),
or the writer of the lives of the prophets that goes by his name, and of
Isidorus (m), are of any weight, Ezekiel was born in the land of Sarera;
killed by the governor in Babylon; and buried by the people in the field
of Maur or Mahurim, in the sepulchre of Shem and Arphaxad. The account
R. Benjamin Tudelensis (n) gives is, that there is a synagogue of the
Prophet Ezekiel by the river Euphrates; and over against the synagogue
sixty towers, ; and between every tower a synagogue. In the court of the
synagogue is a library; and behind it the grave of Ezekiel the son of
Buzi the priest; and over it a large vault, of a beautiful building,
erected by Jeconiah king of Judah, and thirty five thousand Jews, who
came with him, when Evilmerodach brought him out of prison; and over the
grave a lamp burns night and day. The Cippi Hebraici say (o) he was
buried by, the river Hiddekel; and Menasseh ben Israel (p) affirms that
he died in Babylon, and was buried there; and so Kimchi (q) says the
tradition is.
