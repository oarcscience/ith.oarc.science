INTRODUCTION TO ROMANS 9

The apostle having discoursed of justification and sanctification, and
of the privileges of justified and sanctified ones, proceeds to treat of
predestination, the source and spring of all the blessings of grace; and
to observe how this distinguishing act of God's sovereign will has taken
place, both among Jews and Gentiles; in treating of which, he knew he
should go contrary to the sense of his countrymen the Jews, who have a
notion that all Israel shall have a part in, or inherit the world to
come (q): and that the Gentiles will be for ever miserable; and nothing
was more disagreeable to them, than to talk of their rejection of God,
and the calling of the Gentiles; wherefore that it might be manifest,
that it was not out of pique and ill will to them, that the apostle said
the things hereafter related; he expresses the most cordial affection to
them imaginable, and which he introduces in [Rom
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001.md), by way of appeal to Christ, who
knew the truth of what he was about to say, and who could, together with
the Spirit of God and his own conscience, testify for him that it was no
lie: the thing he appeals for the truth of, is in [Rom
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002.md), that the salvation of the Jews
lay near his heart; that it was no pleasure to him to think or speak of
their rejection, but was what gave him continual pain and uneasiness:
and his great desire for their good is expressed in a very strong and
uncommon manner, [Rom 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md), the reasons
of it are partly the relation they stood in to him, being his brethren
and kinsmen; and partly the many privileges they had been favoured with
of God; an enumeration of which is given, [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md), and foreseeing an objection, he
prevents it, which might be made, that if the Jews were cast off, the
promise of God to that people that he would be their God, would become
void, and the preaching the Gospel of Christ to them of no effect; to
which he answers by distinguishing between Israel and Israel, or the
elect of God among them, and those that were not; wherefore though the
latter were rejected according to the purpose of God, the promise and
preaching of the word had their effect in the former, [Rom
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006.md), and that there was such a
distinction, he proves from the two sons of Abraham, Isaac and Ishmael,
who were both Abraham's seed; yet one was a child of promise, and the
other a child of the flesh, and were emblematical of the children of the
promise, and the children of the flesh among that people; [Rom
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007.md), and further confirms this by the
instance of Jacob and Esau, who were born of the same parents, and were
twins; and yet one was in the favour of God, and the other not; and that
this was owing not to works, but to the sovereign will of God in
election, he proves by observing that this was before good or evil were
done by either of them, [Rom 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011.md), and
that this was notified to Rebekah before, [Rom
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#012.md), as appears from a passage in
[Gen 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md), and by another passage in
[Mal 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002.md), which is cited, [Rom
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#013.md), then an objection is started,
[Rom 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#014.md), that if God loves one, and
hates another, both being in equal circumstances, as Jacob and Esau
were, he must be guilty of unrighteousness; which he answers and
removes, first by a detestation of such a charge against God, and then
by producing testimonies out of the books of Moses, proving both
election and reprobation, as being not of the works of men, but of the
will of God; the former of these he proves, [Rom
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#015.md), from [Exo
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019.md), by which it appears, that the
choice of men to salvation is not according to the will of man, but
according to the grace and love of God, [Rom
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016.md), the latter he proves by the case
of Pharaoh, [Rom 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017.md), and the
Scripture relating to that, [Exo 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016.md),
and from both testimonies concludes, [Rom
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018.md), that God's having mercy on one,
and hardening another, are according to his sovereign will and pleasure;
then another objection rises, up, if so, God has no reason to find fault
with men that are hardened in sin, since they are according to his will,
and in sinning do but fulfil it, and which no man resists; and this
objection is formed in a very pert and sneering manner, and insinuates
that God is cruel and acts unreasonably, [Rom
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019.md), to which he answers, by putting
the objector in mind that he was a man, a mere creature that started it,
and that it was God against whom it was made; and by observing the folly
and madness of replying against God, and the absurdity of such a
procedure, taken from the consideration of the one being a creature, and
the other the Creator, [Rom 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020.md), and
by instancing in the case of the potter, who has power over his clay, to
form it in what shape, and for what use he pleases, [Rom
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021.md), and accommodates this, both to
the affair of election and reprobation, and to the business of the
latter first, [Rom 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md), where he
observes the end of God in it to show forth his power and wrath, and
describes the subjects of it, which clears him from injustice, and
points at the patience of God towards them, which frees him from the
charge of cruelty, [Rom 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md), and then
proceeds to apply the metaphor before used, to the objects of election
styled vessels of mercy, and the end of the Lord to manifest the riches
of his glory in them, and the method he takes to bring them to eternal
happiness, by preparing them for it by grace, [Rom
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#023.md), which is done in the effectual
calling, the objects of which are both Jews and Gentiles, [Rom
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#024.md), That it is the will of God that
the Gentiles should be called, he proves, [Rom
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md), from some passages in Hosea,
[Hos 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md), and that God had chosen,
and so would call some among the Jews, he clearly makes appear, [Rom
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md), from some prophecies of Isaiah,
[Isa 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md), and then he concludes the
chapter by observing the free and distinguishing grace of God, in the
calling of the Gentiles, and the justification of them by the
righteousness of Christ; that such who were far off from it, and sought
not after it, should enjoy it, [Rom
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030.md), when the Israelites, who were
diligent and zealous in seeking after a righteousness to justify them
before God, yet did not arrive to one, [Rom
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031.md), the reasons of which are given,
[Rom 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032.md), because it was not the
righteousness of faith, or the righteousness of Christ received by faith
they sought; but a legal one, and by works which can never be attained
by sinful men: they sought after a wrong righteousness, and in a wrong
way, because they stumbled at Christ, and rejected him and his
righteousness; and this removes an objection which is suggested in the
two preceding verses, that God is unrighteous in calling the Gentiles,
who never sought after righteousness, and in rejecting the Jews that
followed after one: and that they did stumble at Christ and his
righteousness, is no other than what was foretold in [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md), and that whoever believes in
Christ, whether Jew or Gentile, shall be saved, he suggests is a
doctrine agreeably to [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md),
which passages are referred to, [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md)

[Romans 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 9:1</span></span>

I say the truth in Christ, I lie not,.... The apostle being about to
discourse concerning predestination, which he had mentioned in the
preceding chapter, and to open the springs and causes of it, and also
concerning the induration and rejection of the Jewish nation; he thought
it necessary to preface his account of these things with some strong
assurances of his great attachment to that people, and his affection for
them, lest it should be thought he spoke out of prejudice to them; and
well knowing in what situation he stood in with them, on account of his
preaching up the abrogation of the ceremonial law, and how difficult it
might be for him to obtain their belief in what he should say, he
introduces it with a solemn oath, "I say the truth in Christ, I lie
not": which refers not to what he had said in the foregoing chapter, but
to what he was going to say; and is all one as if he had said, as I am
in Christ, a converted person, one born again, and renewed in the spirit
of my mind, what I am about to speak is truth, and no lie; or I swear by
Christ the God of truth, who is truth itself, and I appeal to him as the
true God, the searcher of hearts, that what I now deliver is truth, and
nothing but truth, and has no falsehood in it. This both shows that the
taking of an oath is lawful, and that Christ is truly God, by whom only
persons ought to swear:

my conscience bearing me witness. The apostle, besides his appeal to
Christ, calls his conscience to witness to the truth of his words; and
this is as a thousand witnesses; there is in every man a conscience,
which unless seared as with a red hot iron, will accuse or excuse, and
bear a faithful testimony to words and actions; and especially a
conscience enlightened, cleansed, and sanctified by the Spirit of God,
as was the apostle's: hence he adds,

in the Holy Ghost; meaning either that his conscience was influenced and
directed by the Holy Ghost in what he was about to say; or it bore
witness in and with the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost with that; so
that here are three witnesses called in, Christ, conscience, and the
Holy Ghost; and by three such witnesses, his words must be thought to be
well established.

[Romans 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 9:2</span></span>

That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. This is
the thing he appeals to Christ for the truth of, and calls in his
conscience and the Holy Ghost to bear witness to. These two words,
"heaviness" and "sorrow", the one signifies grief, which had brought on
heaviness on his spirits; and the other such pain as a woman in travail
feels: and the trouble of his mind expressed by both, is described by
its quantity, "great", it was not a little, but much; by its quality it
was internal, it was in his "heart", it did not lie merely in outward
show, in a few words or tears, but was in his heart, it was a heart
sorrow; and by its duration, "continual", it was not a sudden emotion or
passion, but what had been long in him, and had deeply affected and
greatly depressed him: and what was the reason of all this? it is not
expressed, but may pretty easily be understood; it was because of the
obstinacy of his countrymen the Jews, the hardness of their hearts, and
their wilful rejection of the Messiah; their trusting to their own
righteousness, to the neglect and contempt of the righteousness of
Christ, which he knew must unavoidably issue in their eternal
destruction; also what greatly affected his mind was the utter rejection
of them, as the people of God, and the judicial blindness, and hardness
of heart, he full well knew was coming upon them, and which he was about
to break unto them.

[Romans 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 9:3</span></span>

For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ,.... Some
consider this as the reason of the apostle's great heaviness, and
continual sorrow of heart, because he had made such a wish as this, and
read the words, "for I have wished", or "did wish"; that is, in my
unregenerate state, whilst I was a persecutor of Christ, and a
blasphemer of his name, I wished to be for ever separated from him, and
to have nothing to do with him; for then I thought I ought to do many
things contrary to the name of Jesus, and this I did out of respect to
the Jewish nation, and because I would not relinquish the Jewish
religion; but oh! what a trouble of mind is it to me? what uneasiness
does it give me when I think of it, and reflect upon it? But this can
never be the apostle's meaning, for he would never have appealed to
Christ in so solemn a manner, and took an oath upon it, for the truth of
his enmity to Christ, and alienation from him before conversion, which
everybody knew; nor was it anything strange, that whilst he was an
unbelieving Jew, he should wish himself separated from Jesus of
Nazareth, and always to remain so; and his having done this before his
embracing of Christianity could be no evidence of his present affection
for the Jewish nation, especially since he repented of it, and was sorry
for it. But this wish, whatever is meant by it, is mentioned as an
instance of his great love to his countrymen the Jews. Many have thought
that his meaning is, that he had so great a value for them, that he
could even wish himself, and be content to be eternally separated from
Christ, everlastingly banished from his presence, never to enjoy
communion more with him, or in other words, to be eternally damned, that
they might be saved. But this is what could never be, and which he knew,
was impossible to be done, and was contrary to that strong persuasion he
had just expressed in the close of the foregoing chapter. Nor is it
consistent with his love to Christ, to wish any thing of this kind; it
would make him to love the Jews much better than Christ; since,
according to this sense, he must wish to be parted from him, that they
might be saved, and consequently must love them more than Christ: nor is
it consistent with, but even contrary both to the principles of nature
and grace; it is contrary to the principles of nature, for a man to
desire his own damnation upon any consideration whatever; and it is
contrary to the principle of grace, which always strongly inclines to be
with Christ, and not separated from him; in a word, to be accursed from
Christ in this sense, could be no proper means of the salvation of the
Jews, and therefore it cannot be thought to be desirable, or wished for.
Some things are said indeed for the qualifying of this sense of the
words, as that the apostle said this inconsiderately, when he was
scarcely himself, through an ecstasy of mind, and intemperate zeal, and
an overflow of affection for his nation; but this is highly to reflect
upon the apostle, and to represent him in a very unworthy manner, when
it is certain he said this with the greatest deliberation and
seriousness; he introduces it in the most solemn manner, with an appeal
to Christ, the Holy Spirit, and his own conscience, and therefore it
could never drop from him through incogitancy, and an overheated
affection. Again, it is said, that this wish was made with a condition,
if it was the will of God, but that he knew was not; or if it could be
for the good of these people, this also he knew it could never be: the
best qualification Of it is to say it is an hyperbolical expression; and
so if it is, it must be with a witness, being such an hyperbole, as is
not to be matched in sacred or profane writings. The words of Moses are
thought to be a parallel one, "blot me, I pray thee, out of the book
which thou hast written", [Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md);
but that is not to be understood of the book of eternal life; but either
of the book of the law, as R. Sol. Jarchi expounds it, which God had
ordered him to write, and his desire is, that his name might not stand
there; or rather of the book of this temporal life, that he might die
and not live. It remains then that these words must have another
meaning. Now let it be observed, that the word here translated
"accursed", answers to the Hebrew word which, with the Jewish writers,
is one sort of excommunication in use among them, and the greater sort;
the forth of it, as given by them, is very horrible, and shocking (r);
See Gill on [Joh 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022.md); and so we may
observe the word "anathema" here used is mentioned as a form of
excommunication in [Co1 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022.md); of all
such as love not Christ and his Gospel, and make it appear by their
principles or practices, or both, that they do not, and so ought to be
removed from the communion of churches. Now, taking the word in this
sense, the apostle's meaning is, that he could wish to be excommunicated
from Christ; that is, from the body of Christ, from the church of
Christ, Christ mystical, as the word "Christ" is used, [Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012.md); to be deprived of the ordinance
of Christ's house, to be degraded from his office in it, and not to be
so much as a member in it. He saw that these branches, the people of the
Jews, were going to be cut off, and no longer to be of the church of
God; and such was his affection to them, that he could have wished
rather to be cut off himself, that they might be spared; and this was an
instance of great love to them, since, next to Christ, the church and
the ordinances of it were exceeding dear unto, and highly valued by the
apostle. Again, it is worthy of observation, that the Hebrew word which
the Septuagint render by the word in the text, is used for any thing
devoted to God, and which could not be alienated to any other use or
service; and if it was a man, or any among men that was devoted, it was
not to be redeemed, but was "surely to be put to death", [Lev
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029.md). Some have thought that
Jephthah's daughter was put to death upon this law; but be that as it
will, the apostle here may reasonably be thought to allude unto it, and
his sense be this, that he could wish himself , "to be devoted unto
death", not from Christ, but "by" Christ; and some copies read "by": I
could wish that my dear Lord and Master, as if he should say, would
appoint and order me to die, might this nation of mine but escape that
ruin and destruction I see is coming upon them, as a nation and a
church; I could be content to die the most accursed death, and be
treated in the most ignominious manner, might they but be saved; a like
expression is that of R. Ishmael (s), "may I be an expiatory sacrifice
for the children of Israel";

"which (says one commentator (t)) he said, , "because of his love to
them"; and it is as if he should say, all the punishment which is right
to come upon them, I will take it on myself, in order to atone for
them;''

and says another (u),

"the sense is, he took upon him their redemption, and this he said, ,
"because of the greatness of his love":''

now for a man to die for his country, that a whole nation perish not,
was agreeably to the sentiments both of Jews and Gentiles, and was the
highest instance of love among men; "greater love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life for his friends", [Joh
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013.md); and this is carrying the sense
of the apostle's wish high enough, and not too far. The persons on whose
account he could have expressed this wish, are described by their
natural relation to him,

my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the flesh: he calls them his
brethren, not in a spiritual sense, nor in a strict natural sense, but
in a general way, as being of the same nation: it is a saying with the
Jews (w), , "all the Israelites are brethren"; for the same reason he
calls them kinsmen; and these appellations he uses to remove that ill
will and prejudice they had conceived in their minds against him, and to
signify the ground of his affection for them: and he adds, "according to
the flesh", to distinguish them from his spiritual brethren and
relations; for though they were brethren in a national sense, they were
not all so in a spiritual relation.

Who are Israelites,.... Which were their national name, as descended
from Jacob, whose name was Israel; and it was accounted a very
honourable one; see [Phi 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md); and the
very name they bore gave the apostle some concern that they should be
cut off; and then he proceeds to enumerate the several distinguishing
favours and privileges they had been partakers of:

to whom pertaineth the adoption; not that special adoption, which
springs from eternal predestination, is a blessing of the covenant of
grace, comes through the redemption of Christ, and is received and
enjoyed only by believers in him; for all that were Israelites, were not
in this sense the children of God; but national adoption is here meant,
by which the whole body of the people, as nation, were the sons of God,
his firstborn:

and the glory; either the ark of the covenant, which is so called in
[Psa 63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002.md), according to Kimchi; or the
clouds in the tabernacle and temple, which were called the glory of the
Lord, and were symbols of his presence, the same with the Shekinah; and
so Aben Ezra interprets power, the ark, and glory, the Shekinah, [Psa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002.md),

and the covenants; not the two Testaments, Old and New, but the covenant
of circumcision, made with Abraham their father, and the covenant at
Sinai they entered into with the Lord; some copies, and the Vulgate
Latin and Ethiopic versions, read, "the covenant":

and the giving, of the law: , a way of speaking the (x) Jews make use of
when they take notice of this privilege; for it was peculiarly given to
them with great solemnity by God himself, through the disposition of
angels into the hands of Moses the mediator, and by him to them; and on
account of this, they reckoned themselves more beloved of God than the
rest of mankind (y).

and the service of God; or "the service", as in the Greek text. So the
Jews (z) are used to call it "the service"; and false worship is called
by them , "strange service", which is the title of one of their Misnic
tracts; and here it signifies the whole worship of God, in the whole
compass of it, sacrifices, prayer, praise, &c. daily, weekly, monthly,
and yearly:

and the promises; both temporal and spiritual, especially such as
related to the Messiah, and which now had their accomplishment.

[Romans 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 9:5</span></span>

Whose are the fathers,.... Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for, according to
the (a) Jewish writers,

"they call none in Israel "fathers", but three, and they are Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob; and they call none "mothers" but four, and they are,
Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah:''

their descent from these fathers was a privilege, though they valued
themselves too highly upon it; but what was the crown and glory of all,
and which they took the least, though the apostle took the most notice
of, is,

and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came; that is, either of
the fathers, or of the Israelites, from whom Christ, according to his
human nature, sprung; being a son of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, of
the seed of David, and the son of Mary; hence the Messiah is called ,
"the Messiah or Christ of Israel" (b):

who is described as

over all, angels and men, being the creator, upholder, and governor of
them; and as having another nature, a divine one, being

God, truly and properly God,

blessed for evermore; in himself, and to be blessed and praised by all
creatures. The apostle alludes to that well known periphrastic name of
God so much used by the Jews, , "the holy, blessed God"; to which, by
way of assent and confirmation, the apostle puts his

Amen. Now all these particular privileges are mentioned by him, as what
heightened his concern for these people; it filled him with heaviness
and sorrow of heart, when he considered, that persons who had been
partakers of such favours, and especially the last, that the Messiah
should spring from them, be born of them, and among them, and yet that
they should be given up to ruin and destruction.

[Romans 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 9:6</span></span>

Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect,.... Or "it is not
possible indeed that the word of God should fall"; see [Sa1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#010.md); This the apostle says, partly to
relieve his own mind pressed with sorrow, and partly to obviate an
objection some might make, or prevent any mistake any might be ready to
go into; as though from what he suggested that what God had said
concerning the people of the Jews, was made void and without effect: for
whether by the "word of God" are meant, the Scriptures in general, the
prophecies of the Old Testament, these were now about to have their
accomplishment, in the rejection of the Jews, and in the conversion of
the Gentiles; or whether by it is designed the Gospel, this, as preached
both by Christ and his apostles, had had its effect upon God's chosen
ones among that people; it was become the power of God unto salvation,
to the Jew first: or rather by it may be intended, God's word of promise
to Abraham, that he would be a God to him, and to his seed after him;
and that he and they should be heir of the world, of this and of that
which is to come; particularly the heavenly inheritance, which he gave
to him by promise; this was not made void, or had taken none effect: for
this was made only to Abraham and his spiritual seed; and therefore
though his carnal seed believed not, and for their unbelief should be
cut off, this did not make the faith, or faithfulness of God of none
effect:

for they are not all Israel, which are of Israel; that is, they which
are the descendants of the patriarch Jacob, whose name was Israel; or
who are of the Israelitish nation, of the stock of Israel, belonging to
that people; they are not all , "the Israel", by way of emphasis, as in
[Psa 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#022.md), or the "Israel of God",
[Gal 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md), the Israel whom Jehovah the
Father has chosen for a peculiar people; which Christ has redeemed from
all their iniquities; which the Spirit of God calls with an holy
calling, by special grace, to special privileges; the seed of Israel who
are justified in Christ, whose iniquities are so pardoned and done away,
that when they are sought for they shall not be found, and who are saved
in the Lord with an everlasting salvation: or in other words, though
they are "Israel after the flesh", [Co1
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018.md), yet not after the Spirit;
though they are by nation Israelites, they are not Israelites "indeed",
as Nathanael was, [Joh 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md); they are
Jews outwardly, not inwardly; they have not all principles of grace,
uprightness, and sincerity in them: now to these spiritual Israelites,
or seed of Abraham, were the word of God, the promises of God concerning
spiritual and eternal things made, and upon these they had their effect;
and therefore it could not be said that the word of God had taken none
effect; though the whole body of Israel after the flesh were cut off and
rejected. Some copies, and the Vulgate Latin version, read, "who are
Israelites"; and the Ethiopic version, "they are not all Israel who came
out of Egypt".

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 9:7</span></span>

Neither because they are the seed of Abraham,.... The Jews highly valued
themselves, upon being the natural seed of Abraham; and fancied, upon
this account, that they were children, which the apostle here denies:
neither

are they all children; as in the former verse, he explains in what sense
they were Israelites, which he had mentioned among their high characters
and privileges, as descending from Jacob, and in what sense they were
not; so in this he shows in what manner the "adoption", [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md), belonged to them, and it did not;
being Abraham's seed, they were his natural children, and the children
of God by national adoption; but, they were not all the spiritual
children of Abraham, nor the children of God by the special grace of
adoption; these characters only belonged to some of them, and which are
equally true of Gentile believers; who being of the same faith with
Abraham, are his children, his seed, and also the children of God:
natural descent from Abraham avails nothing in this case, as is clear
from the instance of Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael was the natural seed of
Abraham, as well as Isaac; but he was not a son of Abraham in a
spiritual sense, nor a child of God; he was not a child of promise, this
was peculiar to Isaac:

but in Isaac shall thy seed be called; see [Gen
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md). The meaning of which is, either
that the progeny of Abraham in the line of Isaac should only be called,
accounted, and esteemed, in an eminent sense, the seed of Abraham, and
not his posterity in the line of Ishmael: agreeably to which the Jews
say (c), that

"Ishmael is not , "in the general account of the seed of Abraham"; for
it is said, "in Isaac shall thy seed be called", [Gen
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md); nor is Esau in the general
account of the seed of Isaac; hence, says R. Joden bar Shalom, in Isaac,
that is, in part of Isaac.''

So another (d) of their writers, on mentioning this passage, observes,

"that it is said in Isaac, , but "not all Isaac";''

or all that sprung from him. Or this has respect to the most eminent and
famous seed of Abraham, the Messiah, in whom all nations of the earth
were to be blessed; who was to spring from him by Isaac, in the line of
Jacob; and may likewise have a personal respect to Isaac himself, the
son of the promise, a child of Abraham in a spiritual sense, when
Ishmael was not; and to whom belonged the spiritual promises and
blessings, and who was to be, and was effectually called by the grace of
God; and may include also his whole seed and posterity, who, both
natural and spiritual, were children of the typical promise, the land of
Canaan, and the enjoyment of temporal good things; and the matter also
children of the antitypical promise, or of those spiritual and eternal
things, which God has promised to Abraham's spiritual seed, whether
among Jews or Gentiles; and which always have their effect, and had,
even when, and though Abraham's natural seed had a "lo ammi", [Hos
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009.md), written upon them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 9:8</span></span>

That is, they which are the children of the flesh,.... This is an
explanation of the foregoing verse, and shows, that by "the seed of"
Abraham are meant, the natural seed of Abraham, who are born after the
flesh, or descend from him by carnal generation:

these are not the children of God; that is, not all of them, nor any of
them, on account of their being children of the flesh, or Abraham's
natural seed; for adoption does not come this way; men do not commence
children of God by their fleshly descent; they are not "born of blood",
but of God, who are the sons of God:

but the children of the promise are counted for the seed; "children of
the covenant", is a common phrase with the Jews; who reckoned themselves
as such, because they were the seed of Abraham: thus in their prayers
they say (e) to God,

"we are thy people, , "the children of thy covenant", the children of
Abraham thy friend.''

And so they were the children of the covenant, or promise, which God
made with Abraham and his natural seed, respecting the land of Canaan,
and their enjoyment of temporal good things in it; but they were not all
of them the children of the promise, which God made to Abraham and his
spiritual seed, whether Jews or Gentiles, respecting spiritual and
eternal things; to whom alone the promises of God, being their God in a
spiritual sense, of spiritual and eternal salvation by Christ, and of
the grace of the Spirit of God, and of eternal life belong; and who are
the seed which were promised to Abraham by God, saying, "thou shalt be a
father of many nations", [Gen 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004.md),
for which reasons, because these spiritual promises belong to them, and
because they themselves were promised to Abraham, as his children,
therefore they are called "children of the promise": or rather, because
as Isaac was a child of promise, being born after the Spirit, by virtue
of the promise of God, through his divine power and goodness, when there
were no ground or foundation in nature, for Abraham and Sarah to hope
for a son; so these are called "children of promise", [Gal
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028.md), because they are born again, not
through the power of nature, and strength of their own free will; they
are not born of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God, according to the will of God and his abundant mercy, by the word of
truth, through his power, Spirit, and grace; and by faith receive the
promises made unto them; and are counted and reckoned as "Abraham's
seed, and heirs according to the promise", [Gal
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029.md), whether they be Jews, or whether
they be Gentiles: and since now the promises of God are all made good to
these persons, the word of God is not without effect, or is not made
void, by the casting off the children of the flesh, or the carnal seed
of Abraham, who were not children of the promise in the sense now given.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 9:9</span></span>

For this is the word of promise,.... The following passage is the
Scripture, which contains the promise concerning the birth of Isaac;
which was the produce, not of nature, but of divine grace and power; and
was typical of the regeneration of God's elect, who "as Isaac was, are
the children of promise", [Gal 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028.md),
for as Ishmael was a type of them that are born after the flesh, and are
carnal men, so Isaac was a type of those, who are born after the Spirit,
and are spiritual men: the promise is,

at this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son; the passage
referred to is in [Gen 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#010.md); which
there stands thus, "I will certainly return unto thee, according to the
time of life, and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son": some difference
there is between the words as cited by the apostle, and as they stand in
the original text; the word "lo", is omitted by the apostle, nor was
there any necessity to repeat it, since it was used only to excite
Abraham's faith, attention, and wonder; also the phrase "thy wife", is
neglected, the reason is, because the words in Genesis are an address to
Abraham, here the substance of the promise to him is produced; besides
it was not only well known in the apostle's time, that Sarah was the
wife of Abraham, but that as such she brought forth Isaac, wherefore it
was not so very necessary it should be mentioned here; add to this, that
it is not repeated in [Gen 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014.md),
which will justify our apostle in the omission of it: but the greater
seeming difference is, that what in Genesis is rendered, "according to
the time of life", is by the apostle, "at this time": some think, that
there may be an emendation of the present original text, and suppose a
various reading, and that the apostle, instead of "life", read "this",
but there is no occasion for such a supposition, or to make this
amendment: for the phrase "the time of life", signifies the present
time, the "nunc stans"; so R. Levi ben Gerson (f), understands this
phrase, "according to the time of life", , "according to this time which
is now standing and abiding" and adds, rightly is this said, because
neither time past nor to come are to be found, only the present time,
the "nunc stans" and afterwards more than once explains it, of this
present time, the next year: and so both R. Solomon Jarchi, and R. Aben
Ezra (g), expound it, , "according to this time", the year following;
that is, exactly according to this present time next year, or this time
twelve month; besides, in [Gen 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#021.md)
it is said, "at this set time", and in [Gen
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014.md), "at the appointed time"; all
which support the apostle in his version.

And not only this,.... This instance of Ishmael and Isaac, is not the
only one, proving that Abraham's natural seed, the children of the
flesh, are not all children, the children of God:

but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac,
"it was said unto her", [Rom 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#012.md),
being in a parenthesis, "the elder shall serve the younger". The apostle
was aware, that the Jews would be ready to say, that the instance of
Ishmael and Isaac was not a pertinent one; since Ishmael was not born of
Sarah, the lawful wife of Abraham, but of a bondwoman, which was the
reason his rejection, when Isaac was the son of promise, by the lawful
wife, and that they were children of Abraham in the line of Isaac, and
so children of the promise, as he was: wherefore he proceeds to mention
the case of Jacob and Esau, which was not liable to any such exception;
seeing they not only had the same father, but the same mother, Isaac's
lawful wife; they were conceived by Rebecca at once, were in the same
womb together, were twins, and if any had the preference and advantage,
Esau had it, being born first; and yet a difference was made between
these two by God himself, and which was notified by him to the mother of
them, before either were born.

[Romans 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 9:11</span></span>

For the children being not yet born, So says (h) the Chaldee paraphrast,

"the prophet said unto them, was it not said of Jacob, , "when he was
not yet born", that he should be greater than his brother?''

the Syriac version supplies, "his children", that is, Isaac's; and the
Arabic version, "his two children". This shows, that the apostle designs
not the posterity, but the very persons of Jacob and Esau; since as he
speaks of their conception in the verse preceding, so of their birth in
this: and though in the words of God to Rebecca, and which are urged in
favour of the other sense, it is said, "two nations are in thy womb, and
two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels, and the one
people shall be stronger than the other people", [Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md); yet this primarily respects the
persons of Jacob and Esau, as the roots of their respective offspring;
and only secondarily their posterity, as branches that should sprout
from them; it properly regards their persons, and only in an improper,
figurative, and metonymical sense, their seed; for in no other sense
could two nations, or two manner of people be in Rebecca's womb, than as
there were two persons there, who would be the authors of two nations
and people; and whatever may be said for their respective posterity,
taking their rise from one common father Isaac, or for their being
chosen or rejected as nations, before they were in being as such, yet it
cannot be said with any propriety, that "Rebecca conceived" their
several offspring "by one, even by our father Isaac", [Rom
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#010.md), which sense well agrees with the
scope of the apostle, which is to prove, that all were not Israel which
were of Israel, and that all Abraham's natural seed were not the
children of God; which he could not better exemplify, than in the
persons of Jacob and Esau; for to have instanced in the posterity of
Esau, would have been foreign to his purpose, and not accord with the
continuation of his discourse in the following verses, which entirely
proceeds upon the subject of personal election and rejection, and with
the scriptural account of the personal characters of Jacob and Esau; and
from hence, as from many other passages, it may be concluded, that
predestination, whether to life or death, is a personal thing, concerns
particular persons, and not nations, or collective bodies of men:

neither having done any good or evil; Jacob and Esau were under all
considerations upon an equal foot, were just in the same situation and
condition, when the one was loved and the other hated; or in other
words, when the one was chosen, and the other rejected; they were
neither of them as yet born, and had they been born, their birth and
parentage could have been no reason why one was chose and the other not,
because in both the same; nor had the one performed a good action, or
the other an evil one; so that Jacob was not loved for his good works,
nor Esau hated for his evil ones; which confirms the truth of this
doctrine, that the objects of predestination, whether to life or death,
are alike, are in the same situation and condition: whether they are
considered in the corrupt mass, or as fallen, they are all equally such,
so that there could not be any reason in them, why some should be chosen
and others left; or whether in the pure mass, antecedent to the fall,
and without any consideration of it, which is clearly signified in this
passage, there could be nothing in the one, which was not in the other,
that could be the cause of such a difference made: so that it follows,
that works neither good nor evil are the causes moving God to
predestinate, whether to life or death; good works are not the cause of
election to eternal life, for not only, this act of distinguishing
grace, passed before any were done, but also these are fruits, effects,
and consequence of it, and so cannot be the causes thereof; God does not
proceed in order branches of salvation, as in calling, justification,
&c. according to them, and therefore it cannot be thought he should
proceed upon this foot in the first step to it; and which is ascribed to
his free grace, in opposition to works. Evil works are not the cause of
the decree of rejection, for this also being as early as the decree of
election, as it must unavoidably be, was before any evil works were
done; sin is not the cause of God's decree, but of the thing decreed,
eternal death; otherwise all the individuals in the world being equally
in sin, must have been rejected: it remains then, that not any works of
men, good or bad, are the cause of predestination in either of its
branches, but the sovereign will and secret counsel of God: that

the purpose of God according to election might stand: the decree of God,
which is entirely free, and depends upon his own will and choice, stands
firm and immutable, and is not to be disannulled by earth or hell, for
it stands not on the precarious foot of works:

not of works: did it, it would not stand sure, for nothing is more
variable and uncertain, than the actions of men:

but of him that calleth: who is the unchangeable Jehovah; it stands upon
his invariable will and immutable grace, whose "gifts and calling are
without repentance", [Rom 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md).

It was said unto her,.... To Rebecca, [Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md),

the elder shall serve the younger, or "the greater shall serve the
lesser", an Hebrew way of speaking; so Japheth is called "the great",
or, as we render it, "the elder", [Gen
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#021.md); and the evil imagination is
said (i) to be "greater", that is, elder than the good, thirteen years;
See Gill on [Luk 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#026.md); The sense is,
Esau shall be a servant to Jacob; which is to be understood, not of
temporal servitude; for in this sense he never was a servant to him; so
far from it, that as soon as Jacob had got the birthright and blessing,
he was obliged to flee from the face and fury of Esau; and upon his
return after many years, he sent messengers to Esau in a very submissive
manner, charging them after this manner, "thus shall ye shall say to my
lord Esau, thy servant Jacob saith thus", &c. [Gen
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#004.md), and when he found that his
brother was coming to meet him, which threw him into a panic fear, lest
he should "smite him, and the mother with the children", [Gen
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#011.md), he prepares presents for him;
and when he came to him, bowed himself seven times, and his wives and
children bowed likewise; and the language in which he addressed his
brother Esau, all the while they were together, was that of "my lord":
now if this oracle was to be understood of outward temporal servitude,
it is strange it should have no appearance, nor any shadow of an
accomplishment in the persons of Jacob and Esau, supposing it was to
have one in their posterity; and indeed the completion of it, in this
sense, is not very evident in their offspring. It is certain, there was
a long train of dukes and kings in Esau's family, before there was any
king in Israel; the posterity of Esau were in lordly grandeur and
splendour, when the children of Israel were grievously oppressed with
hard bondage in Egypt. The single instance usually referred to, when the
Edomites became tributaries to David, was near a thousand years after
the giving out of this oracle; and this show of servitude did not last
long, for in Joram's time they revolted, and so continued; and it is
evident, that at the time of the Babylonish captivity, the children of
Edom were prosperous and triumphant, and said concerning Jerusalem,
"Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof", [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md), this servitude therefore is to
be understood in a spiritual sense, of Esau's exclusion from the favour
of God, and blessings of grace, signified by his being rejected from
inheriting the blessing, which was given to Jacob; and it appeared that
he was not a son, but a servant, by his departure, and pitching his
dwelling elsewhere; which showed he had no interest in spiritual
adoption, no right to the covenant of grace, nor was he an heir of
heaven, all which were peculiar to Jacob: Esau was a servant of sin,
under the dominion of it, and in bondage to it; whilst Jacob was the
Lord's freeman, and, as a prince, had power with God and with men, and
prevailed: Esau was serviceable to Jacob, both in things temporal and
spiritual; as reprobates are to the elect, for all things are for their
sakes, and work together for their good; Jacob's being obliged to flee
from his brother, was for his good; by this means he got him a suitable
wife, and large substance: his brother's meeting him on his return,
which gave him so much pain and uneasiness, issued in his spiritual
good; this sent him to the throne of grace, to humble himself before
God, acknowledge his mercies, and his dependence on him, to implore his
help, and plead his promises; and thus the oracle was verified in the
persons of Jacob and Esau.

As it is written,.... In [Mal 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002.md);

Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. These words are explanative
of the former; they are of like import, and the one interpret the other;
and show, that the former are to be understood in a spiritual, and not
in a temporal sense, and of the persons, and not the posterity of Jacob
and Esau; for though Malachi prophesied long after Jacob and Esau were
personally dead, yet the Lord in that prophecy manifestly directs the
murmuring Jews to the personal regard he had had to Jacob and Esau, and
which had continued in numberless instances to their respective
posterities, in order to stop their mouths, and reprove their
ingratitude; and though he speaks of the nation of the Edomites, and to
the posterity of Israel, yet it is evident, that he has a respect to the
persons of Jacob and Esau, from whence they sprung, when he says, "was
not Esau Jacob's brother?" [Mal 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002.md),
now though an Edomite may be said to be brother to an Israelite, yet
Esau is never said, nor can he with any propriety be said to be the
brother of Jacob's posterity: it remains, that these words regard their
persons, and express the true spring and source of the choice of the
one, and the rejection of the other; and which holds true of all the
instances of either kind: everlasting and unchangeable love is the true
cause and spring of the choice of particular persons to eternal
salvation; and hatred is the cause of rejection, by which is meant not
positive hatred, which can only have for its object sin and sinners, or
persons so considered; but negative hatred, which is God's will, not to
give eternal life to some persons; and shows itself by a neglect of
them, taking no notice of them, passing them by, when he chose others;
so the word "hate" is used for neglect, taking no notice, where positive
hatred cannot be thought to take place, in [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026.md).

What shall we say then?.... A form of expression the apostle frequently
uses, when he is about to introduce an objection, as is what follows:

is there unrighteousness with God? This is not an objection of his own,
but of an adversary, which he takes up and returns an answer to; and
which itself greatly serves to settle and confirm the true sense and
meaning of the apostle in this place; as that it could not be, that
election and rejection of men should proceed according to their merits;
or that God chooses some for their good works, and rejects others for
their wicked works, because no man could ever pretend to charge God with
unrighteousness on this account; nor could it be that God chose and
rejected men, upon a foresight of their good and evil works, for this
also would not be liable to such an objection; nor that the Jews, having
made the law of none effect by their traditions, despised the Gospel,
crucified Christ, and persecuted his disciples, are therefore cast off,
and the Gentiles, being obedient both in word and deed, are received
into favour, for this likewise would not be chargeable with
unrighteousness by men; but that two persons, as Jacob and Esau, and the
same may be said of all mankind, being upon an equal foot, not being yet
born, nor having done either good or evil, an inequality, a difference
is made between them, by God himself; the one is chose, the other passed
by: now in this is some show, some pretence at least, for such an
objection; nor is it any wonder to meet with it from the carnal reason
of men; wherefore we may be sure that the latter, and not either of the
former, is the true sense of the apostle; since only this, and not
either of them, is liable to such an exception: let us attend to the
apostle's answer, which is "first" in his usual manner, by way of
detestation and abhorrence,

God forbid: God is not unrighteous in his nature; nor in any of his ways
and works; nor in this, in choosing some and rejecting others. There is
no unrighteousness with God in that part of predestination, commonly
called election; for this is neither an act of justice, nor injustice;
not of justice, but of grace and mercy; of undue and undeserved grace
and mercy, of mere sovereign grace and mercy; and is what God was not
obliged to do; wherefore to choose some and not others, is no act of
injustice; for injustice is a violation of justice, which has no place
in this affair: if it is an act of injustice, it must be either to them
that are chosen, or to them that are not; not to them that are chosen,
to them it is an act of favour and good will, they are chosen to grace
and glory, to holiness here, and happiness hereafter; not to them that
are passed by, because they had no right nor claim to the grace and
glory, which by this act are denied them, and therefore no injustice is
done them. Every prince may choose his own ministers and favourites, and
who he will have of his privy council, without doing any injustice, to
those he takes no notice of; every man may choose his own company who he
will converse with, without doing any wrong to such he does not think
fit to admit to an intimacy with him; and yet men are not willing to
allow the Most High that liberty, which every man daily takes, and may
lawfully make use of: nor is there any unrighteousness with God in the
other branch of predestination, commonly called reprobation, which is
either negative or positive; negative reprobation is the act of
preterition, or God's passing by, leaving, taking no notice of some,
while he chose others: now the objects of this act are to be considered
either in the pure, or in the corrupt mass; if in the pure mass, i.e. of
creatureship, which seems to be the apostle's meaning, as being not yet
created, made, or born, and having done neither good nor evil; no
injustice is done by this act, for as it found them, it left them; it
put nothing into them, no evil in them, nor appointed them to any, of
any kind; man after, and notwithstanding this act, came into the world
an upright creature, and became sinful, not by virtue of this act, but
by their own inventions: or if considered as in the corrupt mass, as
fallen creatures, sunk into sin and misery, which is the case of all
mankind; since God was not obliged to save any of the sinful race of
men, whose destruction was of themselves, it could be no injustice to
pass by some of them in this condition, when he chose others; for if it
would have been no injustice to have condemned all, as he did the angels
that sinned, whom he spared not, it can be no act of injustice in him,
to leave some of them in that condition, which sin had brought them
into, whilst he has mercy on others; unless to have mercy on any, can be
thought to be an act of injustice: what unrighteousness can there be in
this procedure, any more than in drowning the world of the ungodly,
whilst Noah and his family were saved in the ark? or in raining showers
of fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities of the
plain, whilst Lot, his wife, and two daughters, were delivered from the
same? Positive reprobation is the decree, or appointment to damnation:
now as God damns no man but for sin, so he has decreed to damn no man
but for sin; and if it is no unrighteousness in him to damn men for sin,
as to be sure it is not, so it can be no unrighteousness in him to
decree to damn any for it: upon the whole it appears, that whatever
show, upon first sight, there may be for a charge of unrighteousness
against such a procedure of the Divine Being, there is no real
foundation for it. The objection is to be treated with abhorrence and
indignation.

[Romans 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 9:15</span></span>

For he saith to Moses,.... That is, God said to Moses. The apostle goes
on to answer to the above objections, by producing some testimonies out
of the writings of Moses, in favour of both branches of predestination;
showing, that the doctrine he had advanced, was no other than what God
himself had delivered to Moses, whose name and writings were in great
esteem with the Jews, whereby the apostle might hope to give full
satisfaction in this point. The first passage he cites, is in [Exo
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019.md).

And will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on
whom I will show mercy. This is produced, in favour of special,
particular, and personal election, and to clear it from any charge of
unrighteousness; and by it, it appears, that God bestows his grace and
mercy in time, on such persons he has willed and determined from all
eternity to bestow it; this, is clear from hence, for since all this is
dependent on his will, it must be as this was his will from eternity,
seeing no new will can possibly arise in God, God wills nothing in time,
but what he willed before time; that this grace and mercy are shown only
to some persons, and that the only reason of this is his sovereign will
and pleasure, and not the works and merits of men; wherefore since this
grace and mercy rise out of his own free good will and pleasure, and are
by no means the creature's due, it most clearly follows, that God in
determining to bestow his grace and mercy, and in the actual doing of
it, whilst he determines to deny it, and does deny it to others, cannot
possibly be chargeable with any unrighteousness.

[Romans 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 9:16</span></span>

So then it is not of him that willeth,.... This is not a consequence
drawn by an adversary, showing that if this be the case, it signifies
nothing for men to will or do, they may even sit still and do nothing,
but depend on the mercy of God; but this is a conclusion of the
apostle's from the above cited testimony, inferring from thence, that
election, which is what he is discoursing of, is "not of him that
willeth",

nor of him that runneth: that is, is not owing to the will or works of
men, to the desires, inclinations, and affections of their minds, or to
the actions of their lives; these are not the motives, conditions, or
causes of this act:

but of God that sheweth mercy; in a free sovereign way and manner, which
he is not obliged to by anything the creature wills or works; he is at
full liberty, notwithstanding whatever they will or do, to give his
grace and mercy, when, where, and to whom he pleases; and therefore to
give it to some, and deny it to others, can never be accounted an act of
injustice, since he is not bound to give it to any. Some make the it to
be the blessing of Isaac, which was not of the will of any of the
parties concerned; not of Isaac who willed it to Esau; nor of Esau who
willed it to himself, but had it not; nor of the will of the persons who
had their desires, not of the will of Rebecca, who was desirous of it
for her son Jacob, nor of the will of Jacob, who desired it for himself,
though he had it; nor of either of them that ran, not of Esau, who made
haste to hunt for, and prepare venison for his father, nor of Jacob, who
ran to the flock, for two kids of the goats; but of God that showed
mercy to him, who, according to his sovereign will and pleasure, had
signified before to Rebecca, that "the elder should serve the younger",
[Gen 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md), as the apostle had
mentioned this so lately, it might still be in his thoughts, and he may
allude to it; but election being what he is discoursing of in the
context, that is the "it" here designed; and what is true of that, is
true of salvation in all its parts, and therefore some understand it in
the large sense of salvation; though by others so qualified and limited,
as to spoil the glory of the text: some saying that the sense is, it is
not of him that willeth and runneth wrong, but of the grace and mercy of
God; but as no man would ever assert, that salvation is of him that
wills and runs wrong, so the apostle had no occasion to deny it: others
say, that it is not only of him that wills, and only of him that runs,
but also of God that shows mercy; making man's will and works joint
causes with the mercy of God in man's salvation; and besides, as Austin
(k) long ago observes, according to this sense, the words might as well
be read, it is not only of God that shows mercy, but of him that
willeth, and of him that runneth, which no Christian would dare to say:
the true sense is, that as election, which is the leading step to
salvation, is not owing at all to the will of men, but to the good
pleasure and will of God; and not at all to the works of men, that being
done before them, and they being the fruits and effects of that, but to
the free love, grace, and good will of God; so salvation in all its
parts and branches, as redemption, justification, regeneration, calling,
and conversion, faith, repentance, hope, love, &c. and eternal life, is
not to be ascribed at all to the will of men, nor at all to the works of
men, but entirely and alone to the love, grace, and mercy of God through
Christ.

[Romans 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 9:17</span></span>

For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh,.... , "The Scripture saith", is a
Talmudic (l) way of speaking, used when any point is proved from
Scripture; and is of the same signification with , "the merciful God
says"; and so the sense of it here is, God said to Pharaoh; the
testimony here cited, stands in [Exo
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016.md); where it is read thus, "for this
cause have I raised thee up", or "made thee stand", "for to show in thee
my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth";
and is produced by the apostle in proof of the other branch of
predestination, called reprobation, and to vindicate it from the charge
of unrighteousness: in which may be observed, that the act of raising up
of Pharaoh is God's act,

even for this same purpose have I raised thee up; which may be
understood in every sense that is put upon that phrase, unless that
which some Jewish (m) writers have annexed to it, namely, that God
raised Pharaoh from the dead; otherwise, I say, all the rest may well
enough be thought to be comprised in it; as that God ordained and
appointed him from eternity, by certain means to this end; that he made
him to exist in time, or brought him into being; that he raised him to
the throne, promoted him to that high honour and dignity; that he
preserved him, and did not cut him off as yet; that he strengthened and
hardened his heart, irritated, provoked, and stirred him up against his
people Israel; and suffered him to go all the lengths he did, in his
obstinacy and rebellion: all which was done,

that I might shew my power in thee; his superior power to him, his
almighty power in destroying him and his host in the Red sea, when the
Israelites were saved: and the ultimate end which God had in view in
this was,

that my name might be declared throughout all the earth; that he himself
might be glorified, and that the glory of his perfections, particularly
of his wisdom, power, and justice, might be celebrated throughout the
world. The sum of it is, that this man was raised up by God in every
sense, for God to show his power in his destruction, that he might be
glorified; from whence the apostle deduces the following conclusion.

[Romans 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 9:18</span></span>

Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will,.... These are the express words
of the former testimony: it follows,

and whom he will he hardeneth; which is the just and natural consequence
of what is contained in the latter; for if God could, or he did, without
any injustice, raise up Pharaoh, and harden his heart against him and
his people, that he might rise up against him and destroy him by his
power for his own glory, then he may harden any other person, and even
whom he will: now this hardening of men's hearts may be understood in
perfect agreement with the justice and holiness of God: men first harden
their own hearts by sinning, as Pharaoh did; what God does, is by
leaving them to the hardness of their hearts, denying them that grace
which only can soften them, and which he is not obliged to give, and
therefore does them no injustice in withholding it from them; by sending
them both mercies and judgments, which through the corruption of their
hearts, are the means of the greater hardening of them; so judgments in
the case of Pharaoh, and mercies in the case of others; see [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md); by delivering them up into the
hands of Satan, and to their own lusts, which they themselves approve
of; and by giving them up to a judicial blindness and hardness of heart,
as a just punishment for their impieties.

[Romans 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 9:19</span></span>

Thou wilt say then unto me,.... That is, thou wilt object to me; for
this is another objection of the adversary, against the doctrine the
apostle was advancing: and it is an objection of a mere natural man, of
one given up to a reprobate mind, of an insolent hardened sinner; it
discovers the enmity of the carnal mind to God; if is one of the high
things that exalts itself against the knowledge of him; it is with a
witness a stretching out of the hand against God, and strengthening a
man's self against the Almighty; it is a running upon him, even upon the
thick bosses of his bucklers; it carries in it the marks of ill nature,
surliness, and rudeness, to the last degree:

why doth he yet find fault? The objector does not think fit to name the
name of "God", or "the Lord", but calls him "he"; and a considerable
emphasis lies upon the word "yet": what as if he should say, is he not
content with the injustice he has already exercised, in passing by some,
when he chose others; in leaving them to themselves, and hardening their
hearts against him, and to go on in their own ways, which must
unavoidably end in destruction; but after all this, is angry with them,
finds fault with them, blames, accuses, and condemns them, for that
which they cannot help; nay, for that which he himself wills? this is
downright cruelty and tyranny. The objector seems to have a particular
regard to the case of Pharaoh, the apostle had instanced in, when after
God had declared that he had raised him up for this very purpose, to
make known his power, and show forth his glory in all the world, still
finds fault with him and says, "as yet exaltest thou thyself against my
people, that thou wilt not let them go?" [Exo
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#017.md); and yet he himself had hardened
his heart, and continued to harden his heart, that he might not let them
go as yet; and when he had let them go, hardened his heart again to
pursue after them, when he drowned him and his host in the Red sea; all
which in this objection, is represented as unparalleled cruelty and
unmercifulness; though it is not restrained to this particular case, but
is designed to be applied to all other hardened persons; and to expose
the unreasonableness of the divine proceedings, in hardening men at his
pleasure; and then blaming them for acting as hardened ones, when he
himself has made them so, and wills they should act in this manner:

for who hath resisted his will? This is said in support of the former,
and means not God's will of command, which is always resisted more or
less, by wicked men and devils; but his will of purpose, his counsels
and decrees, which stand firm and sure, and can never be resisted, so as
to be frustrated and made void. This the objector takes up, and improves
against God; that since he hardens whom he will, and there is no
resisting his will, the fault then can never lie in them who are
hardened, and who act as such, but in God; and therefore it must be
unreasonable in him to be angry with, blame, accuse, and condemn persons
for being and doing that, which he himself wills them to be and do. Let
the disputers of this world, the reasoners of the present age, come and
see their own faces, and read the whole strength of their objections, in
this wicked man's; and from whence we may be assured, that since the
objections are the same, the doctrine must be the same that is objected
to: and this we gain however by it, that the doctrines of particular and
personal election and reprobation, were the doctrines of the apostle;
since against no other, with any face, or under any pretence, could such
an objection be formed: next follows the apostle's answer.

[Romans 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 9:20</span></span>

Nay, but O man, who art thou that repliest against God?.... Or
"answerest again to God": some have been so weak and wicked as to
suggest, that the apostle met with an objection he could not answer, or
give a fair solution of, and therefore takes the method he does: but
when the several things returned in answer by the apostle are
considered, it will appear that he has taken the wisest method to
silence such an audacious objector, and that he abundantly clears God
from the charge of cruelty and unmercifulness. And he answers "first",
by putting the insolent creature in mind of what he was; "nay, but O
man, who art thou?" &c. Thou art man, and not God; a creature, and not
the Creator; and must not expect that he, thy Creator, will give an
account of his matters to thee, or a reason why he does, this or the
other thing. Thou art but a man, who in his best estate was vanity,
being mutable; thou art a fallen sinful creature, and obnoxious to the
wrath and displeasure of God for thy sins, and darest thou to open thy
mouth against him? thou art a poor, foolish, and ignorant man, born like
a wild ass's colt, without understanding, and wilt thou take upon thee
to confront, direct, or counsel the Most High, or tell him what is
fitting to be done, or not done? "next" the apostle answers, by pointing
out his folly and madness, in replying to God. To speak to God in behalf
of a man's self at the throne of grace, in the most submissive manner,
for any mercy or favour wanted, is an high privilege, and it is a
wonderful condescension in God to admit of; and when a man, a good man
takes upon him to plead with God on the behalf of others, of a wicked
people, a sinful nation, he ought to set before him the example and
conduct of Abraham, who in a like case acknowledged himself to be but
dust and ashes, and more than once entreated, that the Lord would not be
angry at his importunity; but for a man to answer again to God, which a
servant ought not to do to his master, to litigate a point with God, to
dispute a matter with him, is the highest instance of arrogance and
impudence: "woe unto him that striveth with his Maker, let the potsherd
strive with the potsherds of the earth", [Isa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009.md), with their equals, with men like
themselves, but let no man dare to "contend with God"; if he should, "he
cannot answer him one of a thousand", [Job
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#003.md); for "he is wise in heart", in
forming all his counsels, purposes, and decrees; "and mighty in
strength", to execute them; "who hath hardened himself against him and
hath prospered?" [Job 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004.md). Another way
the apostle takes in answering the objection is, by showing the
absurdity of a creature's wrangling with God about his make, and the
circumstances in which he is made:

shall the thing formed, say unto him that formed it, why hast thou made
me thus? reference is had to [Isa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009.md); Now as it would be a most absurd
thing for the clay, was it capable of speaking, to say to the fashioner
of it, why dost thou put me into such or such a shape and form? or for
any piece of workmanship to say to the maker of it, he has no hands, no
head, no judgment and skill; or for a child to say to its parents, what
begettest thou, or what hast thou brought forth? so absurd and
unreasonable is it, for any to say to God, why hast thou appointed me to
such and such ends and purposes, and has brought me into being in such a
manner, and under such circumstances? There is a story in the Talmud
(n), which may be pertinently produced here;

"it happened to R. Eleazar ben Simeon, of Migdal Gedur, that he went
from his master's house, and he was riding on an ass, and travelling by
the sea side, and as he rejoiced exceedingly, and his heart was lifted
up because he had learnt much of the law, there was joined to him a
certain man that was very much deformed, and says to him, peace be upon
thee Rabbi; but he did not return the salutation to him, but says to him
"Raca", how deformed is that man! perhaps all thy townsmen are as
deformed as thee; he replied to him, I do not know, but go and say, ,
"to the workman that made me", how ugly is this vessel thou hast made,
when he knew in himself that he has sinned; upon this the Rabbi
dismounted his ass, and fell down before him, and said unto him, I
entreat of thee forgive me; he said unto him, I cannot forgive thee,
till thou goest "to the workman that made me", and say, how ugly is this
vessel which thou hast made.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 9:21</span></span>

Hath not the potter power over the clay,.... By the power the potter has
over the clay, to shape it in what form he pleases, and out of it to
make what vessels he pleases, and for what purposes he thinks fit, which
will be most to his own advantage, the apostle expresses the sovereign
and unlimited powder which God has over his creatures; the passages
referred to, are [Isa 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008.md), in which
God is represented as the potter, and men as clay in his hands; now if
the potter has such power over the clay which he did not make, only has
made a purchase of, or has it in his possession, much more has God a
power, who has created the clay, to appoint out of it persons to
different uses and purposes, for his own glory, as he sees fit; even

of the same lump, to make one vessel to honour, and another to
dishonour. The apostle seems to design hereby, to point out to us the
object of predestination to be man, as yet not made, but as lying in the
mere mass of creatureship, signified by the unformed clay, before put
into any shape; and is an allusion to the first creation of man, out of
the clay, or dust of the earth, [Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md); for such a consideration of man
best agrees with the clay, lump, or mass, not yet formed, than as
already made, and much less as fallen and corrupted: for if men, in
predestination, were considered in the corrupt mass, or as fallen
creatures, they could not be so well said to be made out of it, both to
honour and dishonour; but rather since they were all dishonourable, that
some were left in that dishonour, and others removed from it unto
honour: besides, if this is not the case, God must create man without an
end, which is contrary to the principle of reason and wisdom; the end is
the cause, for which a thing is what it is; and it is a known rule, that
what is first in intention, is last in execution, and "vice versa": the
end is first fixed, and then the means; for God to create man, and then
to fix the end of his creation, is to do what no wise potter would do,
first make his pots, and then think of the end of making them, and the
use they are to be put unto. To make one vessel to honour, and another
to dishonour, is for God to appoint creatures, which are to be made out
of the same mass and lump, for his own glory; which end, his own glory,
he determines to bring about by different means, as these following:
with respect to the vessels of honour, whom he appoints for his glory,
he determines to create them; to suffer them to fall into sin, whereby
they become polluted and guilty; to raise and recover them, by the
obedience, sufferings, and death of his Son; to regenerate, renew, and
sanctify them, by his Spirit and grace, and to bring them to eternal
happiness; and hereby compass the aforesaid end, his own glory, the
glorifying of his grace and mercy, in a way consistent with justice and
holiness: with respect to the vessels of dishonour, whom he also
appoints for the glorifying of himself, he determines to create them out
of the same lump; to suffer them to fall into sin; to leave them in
their sins, in the pollution and guilt of them, and to condemn them for
them; and hereby gain his ultimate end, his own glory, glorifying the
perfections of his power, justice, and holiness, without the least
blemish to his goodness and mercy: now if a potter has power, for his
own advantage and secular interest, to make out of the same clay what
vessels he pleases; much more has God a power, out of the same mass and
lump of creatureship, to appoint creatures he determines to make to his
own glory; which he brings about by different methods, consistent with
the perfections of his nature.

[Romans 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 9:22</span></span>

What if God, willing to show his wrath,.... The apostle proceeds to
clear God from any charge of cruelty and unmercifulness, by observing
his conduct in time, both towards those he passes by, and towards those
he chooses; for in this and the following verse, nothing is said
relating to any act of God before time, everything of that kind being
considered already. In this verse, the apostle considers the conduct of
God towards the vessels of dishonour; and let it be observed, that these
are called

vessels of wrath fitted for destruction; they are said to be vessels,
and so no longer considered in the clay, in the mass and heap of
creatureship, but as creatures formed and made, and brought into being;
and so to be used as instruments in God's hands, to subserve his ends
and purposes, and therefore called "vessels"; and not only so, but
"vessels of wrath", fallen sinful creatures, and so deserving of the
wrath of God, and objects of his vindictive justice, in whom he may
righteously display his wrath and vengeance: hence they may be so
called, being as vessels filled with his wrath; as such who are the
instruments and executioners of his wrath are called, in [Isa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005.md), , "vessels of his wrath"; and in
[Jer 50:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#025.md); where the Septuagint use
the same phrase as here: and they are moreover said to be "fitted for
destruction", as Haman is said to be by the Jews (o); whom they affirm
to be the same with Memucan, and ask why is his name called Memucan? and
answer, , "because he was fitted for punishment": so these are said to
be "fitted for destruction", that is, eternal damnation; not by God, for
this does not respect God's act of ordination to punishment; but by
Satan, the god of this world, that blinds them, who works effectually in
them, and leads them captive at his will; and by themselves, by their
own wickedness, hardness of heart, and impenitence, do they treasure up
to themselves wrath, against the day of wrath, so that their destruction
is of themselves: a phrase somewhat like this is used in [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012.md), where the Psalmist, under some
dismal apprehensions of himself, says, that he was like , "a perishing
vessel", or "a vessel of perdition"; the Septuagint render it, , "a lost
vessel". Now what is the method of the divine conduct towards such
persons? he

endures them with much longsuffering; as he did the old world, before he
destroyed it; and as he did Pharaoh, before he cut him off: God not only
supports such persons in their beings, amidst all their impieties and
iniquities, but follows and fills them with his providential goodness,
insomuch that many of them have more than heart can wish; nay, to many
he affords the outward means of grace, which they slight and despise;
externally calls them, but they refuse, loving darkness rather than
light, and therefore are inexcusable: now if after all this patience,
indulgence, and forbearance, when he could in justice have sent them to
hell long ago, he is "willing to show his wrath"; his displicency at sin
and sinners, his vindictive justice, his righteous vengeance:

and to make his power known; what it is he can do, by the utter
destruction and damnation of such persons; what man in his senses can
ever find fault with such a procedure, or charge it with tyranny,
cruelty, and unmercifulness?

And that he might make known the riches of his glory,.... That is, his
glorious riches, the perfections of his nature, his love, grace, and
mercy, his wisdom, power, faithfulness, justice, and holiness; all which
are most evidently displayed in the salvation of his people, here called

vessels of mercy, which he hath afore prepared unto glory. They are said
to be vessels, and so considered as creatures, made and brought into
being; "vessels of mercy", and so fallen creatures, and by sin become
miserable, for only such are objects of mercy: they are not called so,
because deserving of mercy more than others, they are in no wise better
than others, and are by nature children of wrath, even as others; but
because God of his infinite goodness fills them with his mercy, displays
it in them, in the redemption of them by his Son, in the regeneration of
them by his Spirit, and in their eternal salvation: and these are by him
"afore prepared unto glory"; to everlasting happiness, which he has
chosen them to before time, and calls them to in time; to this glory he
does not take them, until he has prepared them for it; which act of
preparation does not regard the eternal predestination of them to
eternal life, but an act of his grace towards them in time; and which
lies in putting upon them the righteousness of his Son, and in putting
his grace in them; or in other words, in justifying them by the
imputation and application of the righteousness of his Son unto them,
and by the regeneration, renovation, and sanctification of their hearts,
by his Spirit. Now what if God willing to make known his glorious
perfections, by displaying his mercy to such sinners, and by preparing
them for heaven in a way consistent with his holiness and justice, what
can any man that has the exercise of his reason object to this? The
whole of his conduct is free from blame and censure; the vessels of
wrath he shows his wrath upon, are such as fit themselves for
destruction, and whom he endures with much longsuffering and patience,
and therefore he cannot be chargeable with cruelty; the vessels of mercy
he brings to glory, none of them are taken thither, until they are
prepared for it, in a way of righteousness and holiness, and therefore
he cannot be charged with acting contrary to the perfections of his
nature.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 9:24</span></span>

Even us whom he hath called,.... From election the apostle proceeds to
calling, the fruit and evidence of it, taking the same method he did in
[Rom 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md), with a view to treat of the
call of the Gentiles, of which he afterwards gives proof from prophecy;
whence it appears to be according to divine predestination, upon which
prophecy is founded; for God foretells that such a thing will be,
because he has foreordained it shall be. These words are explanative of
the former, and show who the vessels of mercy are; they are such whom
God calls by his grace. Election may be known by calling, as the cause
by its effect, and that without an extraordinary revelation. This may as
well be known, as man's adoption, justification, and the forgiveness of
his sins; for as all the chosen are, and shall be called in time, so all
that are truly called by the grace of God, are manifestly, and to a
demonstration, the chosen vessels of salvation: if a man is satisfied of
his calling, he ought to be equally so of his election, the one being
demonstrable by the other; and for such an one to doubt of it, is his
sin and crime. Moreover, the above phrase, "afore prepared for glory",
is here further explained; to be afore prepared for glory, is no other
than to be called, sanctified, and justified, in the name of the Lord
Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God; for this is the saints' preparation
for glory, before they come to it; and hereby the means are expressed,
even sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, through
which God appoints his people unto salvation: now this calling is to be
understood, not of a call to any office, as of Aaron to the priesthood,
of Saul to the kingdom, of the disciples of Christ to apostleship, or of
ministers to the work of the ministry; for persons may be called to the
highest office in church and state, as Judas to: apostleship, and
Pharaoh to the throne of Egypt, and yet have no share in electing grace:
nor of a call by the external ministry of the word, which is often
slighted, despised, and of none effect; in this sense many are called,
who are not chosen: but of a call that is by the powerful, efficacious,
and irresistible grace of God; a call that is internal, that reaches the
heart, and not the ear only: a special one that is peculiar to God's
elect, is by special grace, and is to special blessings, as both grace
and glory; it is an high, heavenly, and holy calling, and is without
repentance; between which and glorification, as between it and eternal
election, there is a close and an inseparable connection. The objects of
this grace follow,

not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles; not all the Jews, nor
all the Gentiles, but some of each; as all are not chosen, all are not
redeemed, only some out of every kindred, tongue, nation, and people; so
not all, but some only are called by grace: and this is not peculiar to
the Jews, it reaches to the Gentiles also; and under the present
dispensation, to the far greater number of them.

[Romans 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 9:25</span></span>

As he also saith in Osee,.... [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md), so "Hosea" is called "Osee", as
here, in the Septuagint in [Neh 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#023.md).
That is, as God says in the prophecy of Hosea, which was given by divine
inspiration; and speaks of the calling of the Gentiles, as the spiritual
Israel, after God had wrote a "lo-ammi", [Hos
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009.md), and a "loruhamah", [Hos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006.md), upon the people of the Jews; and
shows, that he had appointed some from among the Gentiles, to obtain
salvation by Jesus Christ; since he foretells their calling, long before
they were in being; which could have no other foundation than his own
eternal sovereign will and pleasure:

I will call them my people, which were not my people; his people they
were before he called them, in some sense; inasmuch as he had chosen
them for his people, had promised in covenant they should be, had given
them to Christ as his people, and him to be a covenant to them: who, as
such, made reconciliation for them, sanctified them by his blood,
redeemed and saved them; but then they were not known to be the people
of God, neither by themselves, who knew not God, and so could not know
themselves to be his people; nor by others, by the Jews, by whom they
were called the uncircumcision, sinners of the Gentiles; looking upon
the character or the people of God, as only belonging to themselves: God
had not as yet laid hold on them as his people, and claimed his right in
them, and made known himself to them as their covenant God; he had not
avouched them to be his people, nor had they avouched him to be their
God; as yet they were not his willing people, nor a holy people, not
being formed for himself, by his mighty grace; nor a people near unto
him, with respect to worship and fellowship, but afar off from him. His
calling them his people, is his acquainting them with their relation to
him, which he had taken them in to himself, of his own grace; for so it
is in [Hos 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md), "And I will say unto
them which were not my people, thou art my people": in the effectual
calling, the Spirit of God is sent down into the hearts of his people,
to witness their relation to him, and to work faith in their souls, to
receive the testimony; when they reply and say, "thou art my God", [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md), and so they come to know
themselves to be the people of God, of which they were before ignorant;
and to be known others, by being made a willing people, in the day God's
power upon them, willing to be saved by him in his own way, and willing
to serve and worship him in his own ordinances, and according to his own
appointment; and by being holy and righteous, having the characters, and
enjoying the privileges of the people of God:

and her beloved, which was not beloved. In the text in [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md), it is, "I will have mercy on her
that had not obtained mercy": hence the Vulgate Latin has added this
clause to the text, though unsupported by any copy, or other version.
The apostle is to be justified in his version, by the Septuagint
interpreters, who have rendered the passage in Hosea, "I will love her
that was not beloved"; and by the true sense of the word there used,
which signifies to love in the most kind, tender, and endearing manner;
see [Psa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md); where the word is used
and so rendered. The sense is not, that God's chosen ones among the
Gentiles were not the objects of his love before calling; for their very
calling is the fruit, effect, and so the evidence of love before. The
love of God is from everlasting to everlasting, invariably and
unchangeably the same; he had chosen them in his Son; he had made a
covenant with them in Christ, had put them into his hands, and made them
his care and charge; he had sent him to die for them, and obtain eternal
redemption for them; and all this before he called them, which
abundantly proves his love to them: but this love was not manifested to
their souls; it had not been shed abroad in their hearts; they had no
sensation of it in their breasts; the streams of that river of God had
not as yet flowed into their souls; nor were they partakers of the
effects of it in themselves; but being called by grace, they feel, they
experience, and enjoy that, and all the happy: fruits and effects of it;
the loving kindness of God is let down into their hearts in the
effectual calling, and with it he draws them to himself, as a fruit and
evidence of his everlasting and unchangeable love to them.

[Romans 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 9:26</span></span>

And it shall come to pass that in the place,.... This is another
citation out of Hosea, and is to be seen in [Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md), and the meaning is, that in
those countries, as here in Great Britain, in the very selfsame place,
or spot of ground,

where it was said unto them, ye are not my people; where were nothing
but idolatry and idolatrous worshippers, and whose worship, works, and
actions, declared them not to be the people of God:

there shall they be called the children of the living God; not only
children of God, but of the living God; in opposition to their idol
gods, their lifeless deities, and senseless statues of gold, silver,
brass, wood, or stone, they fell down to and worshipped. The chosen of
God among the Gentiles, were from all eternity predestinated to the
adoption of children; this blessing was provided, laid up, and secured
for them, in the covenant of grace; in this relation of children were
they given to Christ, and under this consideration of them did he
partake of the same flesh and blood with them, and died, to gather them
together, who were scattered abroad in the several parts of the world;
and because they were antecedently sons by adopting grace, therefore the
Spirit of God in effectual calling is sent down into their hearts to
bear witness to their spirits, that they are the children of the living
God, and to work faith in their souls to believe it; by which grace they
receive this blessing, as all others, even the right and privilege of
being the children of God; by this they claim it, and enjoy the comfort
of it; and so are manifestly, both to themselves and others, the
children of God by faith in Christ Jesus; though this will more clearly
appear another day, than it does now.

[Romans 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 9:27</span></span>

Esaias crieth concerning Israel,.... The apostle having produced proper
testimonies in proof of the calling of the Gentiles, proceeds to mention
others; showing, that some few of the Jews also were to be called,
according to prophecy, founded upon divine predestination; which, though
they are full proofs of the calling of some from among the Jews, yet at
the same time suggest the casting off of the far greater number of them;
and which is the apostle's view in citing them, as appears from what he
says both here and in the two following chapters. The first testimony is
taken out of [Isa 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md), and is
prefaced or introduced with these words; which either express the great
concern of mind and sorrow of heart, with which the prophet spoke them,
even with strong crying and tears, seeing a remnant of them only was to
be saved; or they show his heart's desire and prayer to God, "for
Israel", as the words may be rendered, how that he cried to the Lord for
them, entreated him with earnestness and importunity, and wrestled with
him on their behalf; or they declare the presence of mind, the freedom
of expression, the boldness and intrepidity with which he delivered this
message to the Jews, which he knew must be ungrateful to them; in doing
which, he run the risk of losing his interest in their affections, if
not his life; and inasmuch very probably they did not choose to hear it,
but turned away from him, he cried aloud, he spared not, he lift up his
voice like a trumpet, as he is bid to do elsewhere, resolving they
should hear what he had to say, from the Lord of hosts. This is a form
of speech used by the Jews, in citing Scripture; thus, , "the prophet
cries" (p), namely, in [Isa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md),
which is spoken of the same prophet as here; and again (q) the Holy
Spirit "cries, and says", in some certain passage of Scripture; and in
another place (r) the Holy Spirit "cried", saying, as in [Joe
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003.md), "they have cast lots for my
people".

Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea:
this part of the testimony seems rather to be taken from [Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md), which may easily be accounted
for; since the apostle had just cited the words in Hosea, and so
carrying them in his mind, transcribes this sentence from thence; it
perfectly agreeing in sense with the passage in Isaiah he had in view,
where it stands thus, "though thy people Israel be as the sand of the
sea", [Isa 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md); that is, though the
number of them be such as to be compared thereunto; though they are many
as the sand of the sea, as the Targum, Kimchi, and Aben Ezra explain it.
This was promised unto Abraham, and had its accomplishment in the days
of Solomon, and in after times; they were for quantity, for number, as
the sand of the sea, even innumerable; and for quality, being barren and
unfruitful, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers:

a remnant shall be saved; that is, a few persons only; , "few are called
a remnant", as Kimchi on the place observes; these are the remnant among
the Jews, according to the election of grace; the few that were chosen,
though many were called by the external ministry of Christ and his
apostles; the little city, and few men in it, even the escaped of
Israel, he that was left in Zion, and that remained in Jerusalem; the
little flock among them, which were as sheep among wolves; the few that
entered in at the strait gate, and found the way to eternal life; the
few that shall be saved; and these shall certainly be saved, with a
spiritual and eternal salvation. These, according to the prophecy, were
to return to the mighty God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised
Messiah; be converted to him, and so saved by him with an everlasting
salvation: God had resolved upon it, whose counsel shall stand; he had
promised it in covenant, which is ordered in all things and sure; he
sent his Son to save these his people from their sins, who is become the
author of eternal salvation to them; the grace of God is efficacious and
powerful enough, to make them willing to be saved by Christ, and to
bring them to him, to venture upon him, and commit their souls to him,
to be saved by him; and almighty power is concerned, to keep them
through faith unto salvation: so that this little remnant, through the
Father's everlasting and unchangeable love, the Son's purchase, prayers,
and preparations, and the spirits grace, which works them up for this
selfsame thing, shall be certainly and completely saved; though with
respect to the difficulties attending it, which could have been
surmounted by none but Christ, and by reason of their discouragements
arising from sin, temptations, and persecutions, they may be said to be
scarcely saved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 9:28</span></span>

For he will finish the work,.... This passage has some difficulty in it:
some, instead of "work", read "account", and suppose it is an allusion
to the balancing of accounts, when the remainder is cut off, which
commonly is but little; and so regards the small number of the Jews that
shall be called and saved, as before: others read it "the word", and
differently explain it; some understanding it of the incarnate Word, of
his being emptied, and made of no reputation, of his being cut off in a
very short time, a few years after he had entered upon his public
ministry, and of the few persons converted under it; others of the law,
of the cutting off, or abolishing the ceremonial law, perfecting or
completing the moral law, and abbreviating it, or reducing it into a
short compendium; others of the Gospel, bringing in and revealing a
perfect righteousness, for the justification of sinners, which the law
could not do; all foreign to the apostle's purpose. Those who think
God's work, his strange work is meant, his work of punitive justice he
will finish,

and cut it short in righteousness, because a short work will the Lord
make upon the earth, when he cut off and destroyed the greater part of
the people of the Jews, and saved a remnant, seem to come nearer the
mind of the prophet and the apostle's design, in citing this passage.
The words as in Isaiah, I would choose to render and explain thus; ,
"the absolute", or "precise degree", so Aben Ezra, interprets it, ,
"that which is decreed by God", the decree concerning the salvation of
the remnant, , "he", i.e. God "shall cause to overflow in
righteousness", [Isa 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md), as an
overflowing river; that is, he shall abundantly execute it, he shall
completely fulfil it, to finish and cut it short in the most righteous
manner, consistent with all his divine perfections; , "for the decree
and that determined", so Aben Ezra, , "the decree decreed" by God, "the
Lord God of hosts", "shall execute", accomplish, make short and full
work of it, "in the midst of all the land", [Isa
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md), that is, of Judea: so that the
words contain a most strong and invincible reason, why the remnant shall
be saved; because God has made an absolute decree, concerning the
salvation of it, which he will accomplish in the fullest manner,
agreeably to his justice and holiness: the or "word", the apostle from
the prophet speaks of, that should be finished, and cut short and
accomplished in righteousness, is the sentence, counsel, or decree,
conceived in the divine mind, concerning this matter: hence as the
decree of election stands firm and sure, not upon the works of men, but
upon the absolute, sovereign, and efficacious will of God; so the
salvation of his chosen people is not precarious, but a most sure and
certain thing.

[Romans 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 9:29</span></span>

And as Esaias said before,.... In the beginning of his prophecy, in [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md).

Except the Lord of sabaoth had left us a seed; the title and character
the great God goes by here, is "Lord of sabaoth", that is, "of hosts",
or "armies"; the Septuagint often leave the word untranslated, as here
and elsewhere, as in [Sa1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md). He is
Lord of the hosts of heaven, the sun, moon, and stars, whom he brings
forth by number, calls by their names, and them to praise him; of the
angels, the multitude of the heavenly host, that do his pleasure, fight
under him, and for him; and of the hosts of nations, of the several
kingdoms of the world, who are all under his government, and among whom
he acts according to his sovereign will and pleasure. Kimchi on the
place says, he is called so,

"because of "the hosts above", and because of "the hosts below", who are
the Israelites, that are called "hosts"; wherefore he would not consume
us all, as we deserved:''

no, according to the council of his own will, he left them "a seed"; or
as it is in Isaiah, a very small remnant": and so the Syriac here, a
remnant"; both signify one and the same, namely, a few persons only: "a
remnant" signifies a few, which remain out of a large number; and so
does "seed", which is reserved for sowing again, after the whole stock
is sold off, or consumed: and the leaving of this small number designs
God's gracious acts of reserving in the election of a people for
himself; the calling them by his grace in time, and preserving them from
general corruption; which if he had not done among the Jews, as Jarchi
on the text says,

"of himself, and by his mercies, and not for our righteousnesses,''

we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha; the cities
which God destroyed with fire and brimstone from heaven, for their
iniquities: had it not been for electing grace, they would have been
like the inhabitants of these cities for wickedness; and the case would
have been the same with us and with the whole world, had it not been for
God's act of election, choosing some to holiness here, and happiness
hereafter. The decree of election is so far from being a door to
licentiousness, that it is the true spring and source of all real
holiness, that has been, or is in the world; and had it not been for
this, there would have been no such thing as holiness in the world; and
consequently not only Judea, but thee whole world, were it not for this,
must have been long before now, like Sodom and Gomorrah, in their
punishment.

[Romans 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 9:30</span></span>

What shall we say then?.... To God's calling of a large number of the
Gentiles, and only a very few of the Jews, according to his eternal
purposes and decrees; what can be objected to it? is he chargeable with
any unrighteousness? must it not be referred to his sovereign will and
pleasure? is it not an instance of his grace and goodness, that he calls
and saves some, when they were all so wicked, that he might in justice
have destroyed every individual of them? or what is further to be said,
concerning both Jews and Gentiles? or what can be objected to what may
be further observed concerning them? as

that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness; the very same
persons among them, who are, called by grace, and are vessels of mercy,
before their calling were without a righteousness, stout hearted, and
far from one; being without Christ, and destitute of his Spirit; they
were ignorant of righteousness, of the righteousness of God, and of his
law, and consequently of what true righteousness is; they were
unconcerned about it, and did not labour after it, as the Jews did. They
did not pursue and improve the light of nature, about God and things of
a moral kind, as they might have done; but held the light and truth they
had in unrighteousness, and indeed were filled with nothing else: and
yet these persons

have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of
faith. The righteousness they attained unto, was not a righteousness of
their own, not the righteousness of works, or a righteousness by the
deeds of the law, to which the righteousness which is of faith is always
opposed; nor faith itself, which is distinguished from it; but the
righteousness of Christ, so called, not because that faith is the cause
or condition of it, but because the discovery of it is made to faith;
that receives it, lays hold on it, and exercises itself on it; by it the
soul renounces its own righteousness, looks to, and depends on Christ's,
and rejoices in it. These Gentiles being called by grace, "attained",
"comprehended", or "apprehended" this righteousness; not by the light of
nature, which makes no discovery, nor gives the least hint of it; but by
the light of faith they apprehended it, as revealed in the Gospel; which
faith they had not of themselves, but of God; so that the whole of this
account is a wonderful instance of the grace of God, and abundantly
confirms the observation made before by the apostle, that "it is not of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that shows mercy",
[Rom 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016.md); since these persons had
nothing in them, disposing and qualifying them for a justifying
righteousness, and yet attained one; and the grace appears to be the
more distinguishing, by what follows.

[Romans 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 9:31</span></span>

But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,.... The
Israelites, the far greater part of the Jews, who were not called by the
grace of God, were all very zealous of the law, called "the law of
righteousness"; because the matter of it was righteous, it was so in its
own nature; and because perfect obedience to it is righteousness; as
also because they sought for righteousness by the deeds of it. They very
violently and eagerly pursued after it, they tugged and toiled, and
laboured with all their might, as persons in running a race, to get up
to the law, and the righteousness of it; and yet Israel, with all the
pains and labour taken,

hath not attained to the law of righteousness: some of them fancied they
had, supposing an external conformity to it, to be all that it insisted
upon; not knowing the spirituality of it, that it required truth and
holiness in the inward parts; and that he that offended in one point of
it, was guilty of all, and therefore could not be justified by it.

[Romans 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 9:32</span></span>

Wherefore? because they sought it not by faith,.... The question is
asked, why they did not attain to that, which with so much diligence
they pressed after? the answer is, because, as they did not seek for
righteousness in a right place, or object, they sought for it in the
law, and the works of it, where it is never to be found by a sinful
creature, and not in Christ, in whom only are righteousness and
strength; so they did not seek for it in a right way, by faith in
Christ, without which it is impossible to please God, and by which only
true righteousness is discerned and received:

but as it were by the works of the law; not by works which looked like
works of the law, and were not; but they sought it as if they expected
their justification before God was to be by works of righteousness done
by them; or as if it was partly by their own works, and partly by the
goodness of God, accepting of them for a justifying righteousness. The
Alexandrian Copy, and some others, read only, "as it were by works"; and
so does the Vulgate Latin version: another reason, or else a reason of
the former is,

for they stumbled at that stumbling stone; meaning the word of the
Gospel, at which Peter says they stumbled, and particularly the doctrine
of justification by the righteousness of Christ; or rather Christ
himself, who was "to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks
foolishness", [Co1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023.md).

[Romans 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">rom 9:33</span></span>

As it is written,.... In [Isa 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md);
for the beginning and end of this citation are out of the latter, and
the middle of it out of the former. This is an instance of "skipping",
from place to place, concerning which the rules with the Jews were (s),
that the reader

"might skip from text to text, but he might not skip from prophet to
prophet, except only in the twelve prophets, only he might not skip from
the end of the book to the beginning; also they might skip in the
prophets, but not in the law;''

which rules are exactly complied with by the apostle. The beginning of
this citation is out of [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md),

behold I lay in Zion. The "stone" said to be laid in Zion, is by the
"Chaldee paraphrast" interpreted of a "king"; by R. David Kimchi, of
King Hezekiah, and by Jarchi of the King Messiah; and is truly applied
by the apostle to Jesus Christ: the layer of this stone is God the
Father, who laid him as the foundation stone, in his eternal purposes
and decrees, in his counsels and covenant, in promise and in prophecy,
in the mission of him into this world, and in the preaching of the
everlasting Gospel: the place where he is laid is Zion, meaning either
literally Judea or Jerusalem, where the Messiah was to appear, whither
he came, and from whence his Gospel went forth; or mystically the
church, where he is laid as the foundation of it, and of the salvation
of all the members thereof; though, through the sin and unbelief of
others, he proves to be

a stumbling stone, and rock of offence; which phrases are to be seen in
[Isa 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md), and are spoken of, and
ascribed to a divine person, even to the Lord of hosts; and are by the
Targumist thus paraphrased, "and if ye obey not", "his word shall be for
revenge, and for a stone smiting, and a rock of offence", and in the
Talmud (t), it is said, that

"the son of David (the Messiah) shall not come until the two houses of
the fathers are destroyed out of Israel; and these are the head of the
captivity which is in Babylon, and the prince in the land of Israel, as
it is said, [Isa 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md).''

So that, according to the ancient Jews, this passage belongs to the
Messiah, and is properly made use of for this purpose by the apostle,
who had seen the accomplishment of it in the Jews; who stumbled at the
outward meanness of Jesus of Nazareth, at his parentage, the manner of
his birth, his education, the mean appearance of himself and followers;
at his company and audience, his ministry, miracles, death, and the
manner of it; and so believed not in him, for righteousness, life, and
salvation; and thus it came about that they did not attain, or come up
to the law of righteousness, or the righteousness of the law: but

whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed; that is, who believes
in Christ unto righteousness, who builds his faith, and hope of eternal
salvation on him, the foundation God has laid in Zion, and at which the
unbelieving Jews stumbled and fell; he shall neither be ashamed here nor
hereafter: he shall not be ashamed of his faith and hope in Christ; nor
of Christ, as the Lord his righteousness; nor shall he be ashamed or
confounded at his appearing, but shall be justified before men and
angels, and be received into his kingdom and glory. There is some
difference between the passage as here cited, and as it stands in [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md), where it is read, "he that
believeth shall not make haste": either to lay any other foundation,
being fully satisfied with this, which is laid by God; or shall not make
haste to flee away, through fear of any enemy, or of any danger, being
safe as built on this foundation; and so shall never fall, be moved, or
ashamed and confounded. Some have fancied a various reading, but without
any reason. A very learned Oriental critic (u) of our own nation has
observed, that the Arabic words "Haush" "Hish" answer to the Hebrew
word, the prophet uses, and which have three significations in them,
"hasten", to "fear", and be "ashamed"; the first of these is retained
here by the Jewish commentators and modern versions; the second by the
"Chaldee paraphrast", and Syriac translation; and the third by the
Septuagint, and the apostle; and they may be all taken into sense, for
he that is afraid runs about here and there, and at length is put to
shame and confusion.
