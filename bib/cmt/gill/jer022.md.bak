INTRODUCTION TO JEREMIAH 22

This chapter is a prophecy of what should befall the sons of Josiah,
Jehoahaz or Shallum; Jehoiakim and Jeconiah. It begins with an
exhortation to the then reigning prince, Jehoiakim, his family and
court, to do justice, relieve the oppressed, and refrain from doing
injury to any; with a promise of prosperity upon so doing, [Jer
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001.md); but, on the contrary behaviour,
the king's family, however precious they had been in the sight of the
Lord, should be destroyed, by persons described as fit for such work,
which would occasion others to inquire the cause of such destruction;
when it would be told them, it was for their apostasy from the Lord,
their breaking covenant with him, and their idolatry, [Jer
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#005.md); then of Shallum, who was then
carried captive, it is predicted that he should never return more, which
was matter of greater lamentation than the death of his father Josiah,
[Jer 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010.md); next Jehoiakim, the
present king on the throne, is reproved, and a woe denounced upon him
for his injustice, luxury, covetousness, rapine, and murders, [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013.md); and it is particularly
threatened that he should die unlamented, and have no burial, [Jer
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018.md); and then the people of the land
are called upon to mourning and lamentation, their kings one after
another being carried captive, [Jer
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020.md); also Jeconiah the king's son,
and who succeeded him, is threatened with rejection from the Lord, and a
delivery of him up into the hand of the king of Babylon, with exile in a
strange country, and death there, and that without children; so that
Solomon's line should cease in him, [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024.md).

[Jeremiah 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 22:1</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord, go down to the house of the king of Judah,.... To
the palace of Jehoiakim, who was now the reigning king; the prophet is
bid to go down to it, because, as Kimchi thinks, he was now upon the
mountain of the house, or in the temple, from whence to the king's house
there was a descent:

and speak there this word; of prophecy, relating to the several kings
hereafter mentioned. This prophecy was delivered some years before that
in the preceding chapter, though it stands here. It is indeed by some
thought to be repeated here on occasion of what is before said, and for
the confirmation of it, putting in mind of what he had prophesied in
former times: and they render the words, with which it begins, "thus
hath the Lord said" (x); so he said to me years ago; which agrees with
what is now delivered.

[Jeremiah 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 22:2</span></span>

And say, hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah,.... O Jehoiakim
king of Judah, hear the word of the King of kings; listen to it, and
obey it, as kings ought to do; and it is for their good, as well as it
is their duty, so to do:

that sittest upon the throne of David; whom he mentions, to put him in
mind of his illustrious ancestor, whose successor he was, that he might
be prompted to follow his example:

thou, and thy servants, and that people that enter in by these gates;
the king and his courtiers, his nobles and privy counsellors, that were
continually waiting upon him, and were frequently passing and repassing
the gates of the palace; for not the gates of the court in the temple
are meant, as Kimchi suggests; and all other people, that either waited
on or came to the king, upon business, with their suits, and to have
their causes heard and tried.

[Jeremiah 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 22:3</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord, execute ye judgment and righteousness,.... Judge
righteous Judgment; give the cause to whom it belongs, without respect
of persons, and without a bribe or corruption; do no unrighteousness to
any, by withholding from them what is due unto them, which was what this
prince was chargeable with, [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013.md);

and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor; that was
robbed or wronged of his property by one superior to him in power or
cunning; See Gill on [Jer 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012.md);

and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the
widow: who are not in a situation, and in such a condition and
circumstances, as to defend themselves; and whom God has a peculiar
regard unto; and therefore they who are his deputies and vicegerents, as
kings and civil magistrates are, ought to protect such persons, and
neither grieve and injure them themselves, nor suffer others to do it:

neither shed innocent blood in this place; to grieve and wrong the above
persons is a very great evil, but to shed the blood of innocent per tons
is a greater still; and this is aggravated by being committed by such
who are set over men to secure and preserve their properties and their
lives; and such heinous sins as these the present reigning king of Judah
was guilty of; which is the reason of their being mentioned; see [Jer
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#017.md).

[Jeremiah 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 22:4</span></span>

For if ye do this thing indeed,.... Or, "in doing do this word" (y);
diligently and carefully attend to this word of exhortation, and
constantly perform the duties required:

then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon
the throne of David; or, upon the throne for David: in his room and
stead, as successors of his; or of his lineage and descent, as the
Vulgate Latin version. The meaning is, that should the kings of Judah do
the duty of their office, before pointed at, there should never be any
want of successors of the seed of David; but there should be a race of
kings descending from him, and sitting on his throne in all after ages,
who should dwell in the royal palace, and go in and out at the gates of
it; and they should also live in great pomp and splendour, in royal
dignity, answerable to their characters:

riding in chariots, and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people;
the king, his nobles, and other his attendants; some on one, and some on
another, when they went out or came in; see [Jer
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#025.md).

[Jeremiah 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 22:5</span></span>

But if ye will not hear these words,.... Will give no attention, and
yield no obedience to them:

I swear by myself, saith the Lord; and by a greater he cannot swear; and
that is the reason why he swears by himself, [Heb
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md); and as, when he swears to a
promise, it shows the immutability of it, the certainty of its
performance, and that it is irreversible, and never repented of, nor
revoked; so it is when he swears to a threatening. The Targum is,

"by my word I swear:''

that this house shall become a desolation; meaning not the temple, nor
the city, but the king's palace.

[Jeremiah 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 22:6</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord unto the king's house of Judah,.... That is, to
the family of the king of Judah; though it may be rendered, "concerning
the house of the king of Judah" (z); and so refer to his palace as
before:

thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon; or, though like to
Gilead (which was a very fruitful country) for wealth, riches, and all
kind of valuable things; and like to the top of Mount Lebanon (a), being
set with tall cedars, for stateliness. So the Targum is,

"although thou art beloved before me more than the sanctuary, which is
high upon the top of the mountains:''

or thou shall be as Gilead, and Mount Lebanon, which belonged to the ten
tribes of Israel, and are put for the whole kingdom of Israel, which was
wasted by the king of Assyria; and in like condition should the royal
palace at Jerusalem be, notwithstanding all its riches and grandeur, and
so the city and temple likewise; as follows:

yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not
inhabited; though as fruitful as Gilead, yet shall become like a barren
desert; and though full of children, courtiers, princes, and nobles, yet
shall be like cities quite depopulated: or, "if I do not make thee" (b),
&c. it is in the form of an oath, as Kimchi and Ben Melech observe; and
to be supplied thus, if I do not do as I have said, let me never be
believed; let me be reckoned a liar, or not thought to be God, and the
like. It shows the certain accomplishment of these things.

[Jeremiah 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 22:7</span></span>

And I will prepare destroyers against thee,.... The Chaldeans, men of
savage dispositions, bent upon the destruction of their neighbours; and
who had already destroyed many nations, and so fit instruments for such
service, as after mentioned; and who yet did not come merely of
themselves, but were moved and directed to it by the powerful and all
wise providence of God, in consequence of a previous preparation and
appointment of them by the Lord in his counsels and purposes. It is, in
the original text, "I will sanctify destroyers" (c); and not only
intends a purpose and design; but suggests, that what they should do by
his will and order would be consistent with his holiness and justice;
and also that being prepared and ready, they might quickly expect a
visit from them:

everyone with his weapons; of war, or slaughter weapons, as in [Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002); or, "a man and his weapons" (d.md);
not a single man only, as Nebuchadnezzar, but him and his army; everyone
of the destroyers prepared with proper instruments to do execution: and

they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire; the
sons of the king, the princes of the blood, the nobles of the land, and
other persons of rank and distinction, comparable to the tall cedars of
Lebanon; so the Targum,

"and they shall slay the beauty of thy mighty ones, as the trees of a
forest are cut down, and cast into the fire;''

or else the stately palaces of the king and his nobles, and other
beautiful buildings, which were lined and ceiled with cedar, are here
meant; and which the Chaldeans burnt with fire, [Jer
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013.md).

[Jeremiah 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 22:8</span></span>

And many nations shall pass by this city,.... After it is burned down
and destroyed; that is, people out of many nations travelling that way:

and they shall say every man to his neighbour; as in company together,
passing along the ruined walls of the city:

wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this great city? so fortified and
so full of people; the metropolis of the whole nation; the greatest city
in the east; yea, the joy of the whole earth; a city peculiarly dear to
the Lord; greatly honoured by him with his presence, worship, and
ordinances, and yet now in ruins; how comes this to pass? they see and
acknowledge the hand of the Lord in it, having a better notion of things
than the Jews themselves had.

[Jeremiah 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 22:9</span></span>

Then they shall answer,.... Or, "it shall be answered" (e); by some in
company, acquainted with the history of this people:

because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God; the Lord
was the God of these people; he chose them for his peculiar people, and
distinguished them by his favours from others; a covenant was made with
them, in which many good things were promised them upon their obedience;
this was kept by him, but forsaken and broken by them; they forsook
their covenant God, his law and his worship; and that was the cause of
their ruin:

and worshipped other gods, and served them; the idols of the people, as
the Targum; they left the true God, who had done great and good things
for them, and worshipped those who were only gods by name, and not by
nature; and served stocks and stones, the vanities of the Gentiles, who
could not bestow one good thing on them; such were their stupidity and
ingratitude, and therefore very justly given up to destruction. This
seems to refer, as Cocceius thinks, not to the first destruction of the
city by Nebuchadnezzar, when it had not so clear and full an
accomplishment; but to the second destruction of it by the Romans, and
the times following that; when the Gospel being preached among the
Gentiles, they had a better understanding of the true God, and of his
covenant, and of the vanity of idolatry, and of the state of the Jewish
nation, and the religion of it, and of the true causes of their ruin.

[Jeremiah 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 22:10</span></span>

Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him,.... Not Jehoiakim, as
Jarchi and Kimchi; but King Josiah, slain by Pharaohnecho; who, being a
pious prince, a good king, and very useful, and much beloved by his
people, great lamentation was made for him by them, and by the prophet
also; but now he exhorts them to cease weeping, or at least not to weep
so much for him, it being well with him, and he taken away from evil to
come; and especially since they had other and worse things to lament;
see [Ch2 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024.md);

but weep sore for him that goeth away: or, "in weeping weep" (f): weep
bitterly, and in good earnest; there is reason for it; for him that was
about to go, or was gone out of his own land, even Jehoahaz or Shallum,
after mentioned, who reigned but three months, and was put into bonds by
Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, and carried by him thither, [Ch2
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#004.md);

for he shall return no more, nor see his native country; for he died in
Egypt, [Kg2 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034.md); Jarchi interprets
the dead, in the first clause, of Jehoiakim, who died before the gate,
when they had bound him to carry him captive, [Ch2
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006.md); "and him that goeth away", of
Jeconiah and Zedekiah, who were both carried captive; and so Kimchi; but
the former interpretation is best. Some understand this not of
particular persons, but of the people in general; signifying that they
were more happy that were dead, and less to be lamented, than those that
were alive, and would be carried captive, and never see their own
country any more; see [Ecc 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002.md); but
particular persons seem manifestly designed.

[Jeremiah 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 22:11</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord touching Shallum,.... Not Shallum the fourth son
of Josiah, [Ch1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015.md); for it is not
likely that he should immediately succeed his father; nor Zedekiah, as
Jarchi; nor Jeconiah, as Kimchi; but Jehoahaz, as Aben Ezra; who seems
to have had several names, as Johanan, [Ch1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015.md); and Shallum here:

the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his
father; the same is said of Jehoahaz, [Ch2
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001.md);

which went forth out of this place; out of Jerusalem, being put down
there from his throne by Pharaohnecho, and carried by him into Egypt,
[Ch2 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#003.md);

he shall not return thither any more; he died in Egypt, or however out
of his own land; but was alive when this prophecy was delivered out,
which was in the reign of his brother Jehoiakim, as some following
verses show.

[Jeremiah 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 22:12</span></span>

But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive,....
Even in Egypt, where Pharaohnecho and his army carried him captive, as
before observed:

and he shall see his land no more; the land of Judah, where he was born,
and over which he had been king: this is repeated to show the certainty
of it, and what reason there was for the above lamentation; since the
people might have been in hopes of the return of him, but now they are
assured they had no ground for it; who, though he was not a good prince,
yet perhaps not so bad as his brother Jehoiakim, who succeeded him; who
appears, by what follows, to have been a very unjust, tyrannical, and
oppressive prince; and therefore there was great occasion for mourning
on the account of Shallum, who very likely was more promising.

[Jeremiah 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 22:13</span></span>

Woe unto him that buildeth his house by righteousness, and his chambers
by wrong,.... This respects Jehoiakim, the then reigning king; who, not
content with the palace the kings of Judah before him had lived in,
built another; or however enlarged that, and made great alterations in
it; but this he did either with money ill gotten, or perverted to a
wrong use, which ought to have been otherwise laid out; or by not paying
for the materials of whom they were bought, or the workmen for their
workmanship; and perhaps this may be the reason why so much notice is
taken of the king's house or palace in the former part of the chapter,
and why it is threatened with desolation, [Jer
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001.md);

that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for
his work; or, "that serveth himself of his neighbour freely"; or, "makes
him serve freely" (g); "and giveth him not his work" (h); makes him,
work for nothing; gives him no wages for it, but keeps back the hire of
the labourers; which is a crying sin in any person, and much more in a
king; see [Jam 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#004.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 22:14</span></span>

That saith, I will build me a wide house,.... Or, "a house of measures",
or, "dimensions" (i); a very large house, whose length and breadth
measure much consisting of many spacious rooms, upper as well as lower;
as follows:

and large chambers; or, "widened ones"; very spacious and roomy; or
"aired", or "airy (k) ones"; through which the wind blows, or into which
much air comes; so that they were good summer chambers, for which they
might be built:

and cutteth him out windows; to let in light and air, as well as for
ornament. Some render it, "and teareth my windows" (l); as if he had
taken some of the windows of the temple, and placed them in his palace,
and so was guilty of sacrilege; but this is not very likely:

and it is ceiled with cedar; wainscotted with it; or the roof of it was
covered with cedar, as Jarchi; or its beams and rafters were made of
cedar, as Kimchi; it might be lined throughout with cedar:

and painted with vermilion. The Vulgate Latin version renders it,
"sinopis"; so called from Sinope, a city in Pontus, where it is found;
of which Pliny says (m) there are three sorts, one red, another reddish,
and a third between them both: this is the same with "minium" or
vermilion. Strabo (n) says, in Cappadocia the best Sinopic minium or
vermilion is produced, and which vies with that of Spain; and he says it
is called sinopic, because the merchants used to bring it to that place
(Sinope) before the commerce of the Ephesians reached the men of this
country, Cappadocia; other versions (o), besides the Vulgate Latin, so
render it here. Schindler (p) renders the Hebrew word by this; and also
by "cinnabar", which is a red mineral stone, and chiefly found in
quicksilver mines; and may be thought to be quicksilver petrified, and
fixed by means of sulphur, and a subterraneous heat; for artificial
cinnabar is made of a mixture of mercury and sulphur sublimed, and
reduced into a kind of fine red glebe; and this is called by the
painters vermilion; and is made more beautiful by grinding it with gum
water, and a little saffron; which two drugs prevent its growing black:
and there are two kinds of vermilion; the one natural, which is found in
some silver mines, in form of a ruddy sand, of a bright beautiful red
colour; the other is made of artificial cinnabar, ground up with white
wine, and afterwards with the whites of eggs. There are two sorts of it
that we have; the one of a deep red; the other pale; but are the same;
the difference of colour only proceeding from the cinnabar's being more
or less ground; when fine ground, the vermilion is pale, and is
preferred to the coarser and redder. It is of considerable use among
painters in oil and miniature (q); and here it may be rendered,
"anointed with minium" or "vermilion" (r); but it is questionable
whether this vermilion was known so early. Kimchi here says, it is the
same which the Arabians call "zingapher", or cinnabar. The Hebrew word
is "shashar", which Junius and Tremellius translate "indico" (s); and
observe from Pliny (t), that there is a people in India called Sasuri,
from whence it is brought; but this is of a different colour from minium
or vermilion; the one is blue, the other red; but, be it which it will,
the painting was for ornament; and either colours look beautiful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 22:15</span></span>

Shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar?.... Dost thou
think that thou shalt reign long, and thy throne be established firm and
secure, because of thy cedar wainscot? as if that was a protection to
thee, and were like the fortifications of a city or tower; when it may
easily be broke to pieces, or burnt with fire; and must be a poor
defence against a powerful enemy. The Targum is,

"dost thou think to be as the first king?''

as David; to be as great a prince, to keep as grand a court, and live in
as splendid a manner, as he? The Septuagint version, instead of "ares",
a cedar, reads "Ahaz", and takes it for the proper name of a king of
Judah; and the Arabic version reads "Ahab"; and so the Alexandrian copy
of the Septuagint; and both confound it with the next clause; the former
rendering the words thus, "shalt thou reign, that thou provokest in", or
"after the manner of Ahaz thy father?" and the latter thus,

"thou shalt not reign, because thou imitatest the original of Ahab thy
father;''

but both wrong; though Grotius seems to approve of this reading:

did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice? that is,
Josiah his father, who ate and drank in moderation, and lived cheerfully
and comfortably; and kept a good table like a prince, without such a
magnificent palace as he, his son, had built; and without oppressing his
subjects, and detaining the hire of the labourer: living in a grand
manner, becoming a king, may be done consistent with doing justice and
judgment; let but that be done, and a prince will not be blamed for
living like himself, and for supporting the dignity of his character and
office, as Josiah did:

and then it was well with him; or, "therefore it was well with him" (u)
he was blessed of God, and was prosperous and successful; he was happy
himself as a prince, and his people under him, both enjoying peace and
prosperity; there are never better times than when justice is done; by
it the throne is established.

He judged the cause of the poor and needy,.... Who could not defend
themselves against the rich and the mighty; he took their cause in hand,
and, having heard it, determined it in their favour, and did them
justice, as princes and civil magistrates ought to do:

then it was well with him; this is repeated, not only to show the
certainty of it, but that it might be observed, and his example
followed:

was not this to know me? saith the Lord; it is not by words only, but by
deeds, that men show that they know the Lord; for some in words profess
to know him, who in works deny him; when princes do the duty of their
office, they thereby declare that they know and own the Lord, by, and
under whom, they reign; that they have the fear of him before their
eyes; this is a practical knowledge of him, and is well pleasing to him.
The Targum is,

"is not this the knowledge with which I am well pleased? saith the

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 22:17</span></span>

But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness,.... He
was wholly intent upon gratifying that lust; his heart was meditating,
contriving, and forming schemes for that purpose; and his eyes were
looking out here and there for proper objects and opportunities to
exercise it:

and for to shed innocent blood; in order to get their money, goods, and
possessions into his hands; avarice often leads to murder:

and for oppression, and for violence, to do it; by making incursions,
and seizing upon the properties of men, and converting them to his own
use; so true it is, that covetousness, or the love of money, is the root
of all evil, [Ti1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md).

[Jeremiah 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 22:18</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim,.... This shows who
is before spoken of and described; Jehoiakim, the then reigning king in
Judah, whose name was Eliakim, but was changed by Pharaoh king of Egypt,
when he deposed his brother Jehoahaz or Shallum, and set him on the
throne, [Kg2 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034.md);

the son of Josiah king of Judah; and who seems to have been his eldest
son, though his brother Jehoahaz reigned before him; for he was but
twenty three years of age when he began his reign, and he reigned but
three months; and Jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he succeeded
him, [Kg2 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md); his relation to
Josiah is mentioned, not so much for his honour, but rather to his
disgrace, and as an aggravation of his wickedness, that having so
religious a parent, and such a religious education, and the advantage of
such an example, and yet did so sadly degenerate: and it also suggests
that this would be no security to him from the divine vengeance; but
rather provoke it, to deal more severely with him;

they shall not lament for him; that is, his people, his subjects, shall
not lament for him when dead, as they did for his father Josiah; so far
from having any real grief or inward sorrow on account of his death,
that they should not so much as outwardly express any, or use the common
form at meeting together:

saying, ah my brother! or, ah sister! a woman meeting her brother would
not say to him, O my brother, what bad news is this! we have lost our
king! nor he reply to her, O sister, it is so, the loss is great indeed!
for this is not to be understood of the funeral "lessus" at the
interment of a king or queen; lamenting them under these appellations of
brother or sister, which is denied of this prince. Kimchi thinks it has
reference to his relations, as that they should not mourn for him, and
say, "ah my brother!" nor for his wife, who died at the same time,
though not mentioned, ah sister! both should die unlamented, as by their
subjects, so by their nearest friends and relations;

they shall not lament for him, saying, ah lord! or, ah his glory! O our
liege lord and sovereign, he is gone! where are his glory and majesty
now? where are his crown, his sceptre, his robes, and other ensigns of
royalty? So the Targum,

"woe, or alas, for the king; alas, for his kingdom;''

a heavy stroke, a sorrowful melancholy providence this! but nothing of
this kind should be said; as he lived not beloved, because of his
oppression and violence, so he died without any lamentation for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 22:19</span></span>

He shall be buried with the burial of an ass,.... Have no burial at all,
or no other than what any brute creature has; which, when it dies, is
cast into a ditch, and becomes the food of dogs, and the fowls of the
air. The "ass" is mentioned, as being a sordid stupid creature; and such
an one was this king;

drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem; as the carcass of a
beast is dragged about by dogs; or as a malefactor, when executed, is
dragged and cast into a ditch: this perhaps was done by the Chaldeans,
who, when he was slain, dragged him along, and cast him beyond the gates
of Jerusalem. So Josephus (w) says, that when Nebuchadnezzar entered
Jerusalem, he slew the most robust and beautiful with Jehoiakim their
king, and ordered him to be cast without the walls unburied; and so,
though he is said to "sleep with his fathers", yet not to be buried with
them, [Kg2 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006.md). Kimchi says that he
died without Jerusalem, as they were carrying him into captivity a
second time; and the Chaldeans would not suffer him to be buried. Jerom
reports, from the Hebrew history, that he was killed by the robbers and
thieves of the Chaldeans, Syrians, Ammonites, and Moabites. Some think,
that as he was bound in chains, in order to be carried to Babylon, that
he was had there, and there died, and after his death used in this
ignominious manner: and the words will bear to be rendered, "cast forth
far beyond the gates of Jerusalem" (x); even as far as Babylon; see [Ch2
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006.md).

Go up to Lebanon, and cry,.... These words are directed to Jerusalem and
its inhabitants, and to the people of the Jews; not to go up to the
temple, as the Targum interprets it, so called, because made of the wood
of Lebanon, as in [Zac 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001.md); or, as
the Rabbins say, because it made white the sins of Israel; but the
mountain of Lebanon, and from thence call to their neighbours for help
in their present distress, as the Assyrians and Egyptians;

and lift up thy voice in Bashan; another high hill in the land of
Israel. The Targum interprets this also of the gates of the mountain of
the house; so called, as Jarchi thinks, because made of the oaks of
Bashan; or, as Kimchi, because there were beasts continually there for
sacrifice, as in Bashan, a pasture for cattle; but the mountain itself
is intended;

and cry from the passages; or "from Abarim"; a mountain of this name on
the borders of Moab, [Num 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012.md). Now
these several high mountains are named, because from hence they might
look around them, and call to their neighbours, if any of them could
help them: it is ironically spoken, for it is suggested that none of
them could:

for all thy lovers are destroyed; their friends and allies, with whom
they had not only entered into leagues, but had committed spiritual
fornication with them; that is, idolatry, as the Egyptians and
Assyrians; but these were now subdued by Nebuchadnezzar, and were at
least so weakened and destroyed by him, that they could give no
assistance to the Jews; see [Kg2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007.md).

I spake unto thee in thy prosperity,.... Or "prosperities", or
"tranquillities" (y); when in their greatest affluence, in the height of
it; this he did, when he sent to them his servants the prophets, as the
Targum, and by them exhorted, reproved, and advised them:

but thou saidst, I will not hear; this was the language of their hearts
and actions, though not of their mouths:

this hath been thy manner from thy youth; from the time they came out of
Egypt, and first became a church and body politic; while they were in
the wilderness; or when first settled in the land of Canaan: this was
the infancy of their state; and from that time it was their manner and
custom to reject the word of the Lord, and turn a deaf ear to it:

that thou obeyest not my voice; in his law, and by his prophets.

The wind shall eat up all thy pastors,.... King, nobles, counsellors,
priests, prophets, and elders of the people; they shall be carried away
as chaff before the wind, or perish as trees and fruits are blasted with
an east wind; to which Nebuchadnezzar and his army are sometimes
compared; see [Jer 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017.md). The Targum
is,

"all thy governors shall be scattered to every wind;''

and thy lovers shall go into captivity: the Assyrians and Egyptians, as
before; see [Jer 52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031.md);

surely then thou shalt be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness;
being disappointed of all protection from their governors at home, and
of all help from their allies abroad; and will then, when too late, be
convinced of all their wickedness, and ashamed of it.

O inhabitant of Lebanon,.... Jerusalem is meant, and the inhabitants of
it, so called, because they lived near Lebanon, or in that land in which
Lebanon was; or rather because they dwelt in houses made of the wood of
Lebanon; and which stood as thick as the trees in the forest of Lebanon;
and where they thought themselves safe and secure, according to the next
clause; not but that there were inhabitants of the mountain of Lebanon,
called Druses; and there were towns and villages on it, inhabited by
people, as there are to this day. After four hours and a half travelling
up the ascent, from the foot of the mountain, there is, as travellers
(z) inform us, a small pretty village, called Eden; and besides that, at
some distance from it, another called Canobine, where there is a convent
of the Maronites, and is the seat of their patriarch; and near it a
valley of that name, full of hermitages, cells and monasteries; but the
former are here meant;

that makest thy nests in the cedars; in towns, palaces, and houses,
covered, ceiled, raftered, and wainscotted with cedars; here they lived
at ease and security, as birds in a nest. The Targum is,

"who dwellest in the house of the sanctuary, and among kings? nourishing
thy children;''

how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a
woman in travail? that is, either thou wilt seek grace and favour at the
hand of God, and make supplication to him; thou wilt then be an humble
supplicant, when in distress, though now proud and haughty (a): or what
favour wilt thou then find among those that come to waste and destroy
thee? This refers to the calamity coming upon them by the Chaldeans, as
the following words show:

As I live, saith the Lord,.... The form of an oath, used to express the
greater certainty of what is after delivered: swearing by his life is
swearing by himself; see [Heb 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md);

though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah; the same with
Jeconiah, so nicknamed by way of contempt; and it may be to denote the
diminution of his glory and kingdom, and the shortness of his reign:

were the signet upon my right hand; ever so near to him, or ever so much
valued by him, as he had been before, and so constantly cared for and
regarded by him; as a ring, with anything respectable engraved on it, is
constantly wore by persons, and greatly valued; especially such as had
on them the image or picture of a person loved, as was usual in some
countries, to which the allusion is by some thought to be: so the
friends of Epicurus used to have his image engraved upon their rings,
which they wore on their fingers in respect to him, and as an omen of
good to themselves (b); see [Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md);

yet would I pluck thee thence: with great displeasure and indignation:
it designs being removed from his throne and kingdom, and out of his
native land, and carried into a far country, as follows.

And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life,.... Cruel
and bloodthirsty enemies, whom nothing would satisfy but his life; such
were the persons following:

and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest: being a terrible
savage people, to be dreaded both for their number and their cruelty; a
strange change this, to be removed out of the hand of God into the hand
of such an enemy;

even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; See Gill on [Jer
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002.md);

and into the hand of the Chaldeans: who were the merciless and
formidable people before mentioned: and this was fulfilled within three
months after Jeconiah or Jehoiachin began to reign, and when he was but
eighteen years of age, [Kg2 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md).

And I will cast thee out,.... Out of his palace, out of the city of
Jerusalem, and out of the land of Judea:

and thy mother that bare thee; who very probably was a bad woman, and
had brought up her son in an evil way, and had led him on and encouraged
him in it, by her own example, and had been a partner with him in his
sins: her name was Nehushta, a daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem; and as
it was here predicted of her, so it was accomplished, [Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md); it is very likely Jeconiah had
no children before the captivity, since no mention is made of them, only
of his mother that was cast out with him:

into another country, where ye were not born; the land of Chaldea, which
was not the native place neither of him nor his mother; being both, as
it seems probable, horn in Jerusalem, or however in Judea:

and there shall ye die; both he and his mother; and so the Arabic
version expresses it, "and there shall ye both die"; as no doubt they
did, though we have no particular account of their death; as for
Jeconiah, he lived a long time in captivity; it was in the "thirty
seventh" year of his captivity that Evilmerodach king of Babylon showed
favour to him above all the captive kings that were with him, and
continued it to his death; but how long after that was is not known; see
[Jer 52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031.md).

soul to return" (c): either by making supplication to God, for it, [Psa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md); or buoying up themselves with
vain hopes, founded upon the declarations of the false prophets, that
they should return; and to which no doubt they had a natural desire, and
comforted themselves with the hopes of it; but all in vain:

thither shall they not return; for they were to die, as before
predicted, in another country, as they did, and never saw their own any
more.

Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol?.... Or like an idol that is
nothing in the world, and like a broken one, that, whatever worship
before was paid to it, has now none at all, but is despised by its
votaries? he is such an one; though he was idolized by his people when
be first came to the throne; but now his power and government being
broken, and he carried captive, was despised by all; as his being called
Coniah, and "this man" or fellow, show; which are used of him in a way
of reproach and contempt;

is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? he is. He is like a vessel made
for dishonour, or is used for the most contemptible service; or like one
that is cracked, or broken, or defiled, that no use can be made of it,
or any delight taken in it; it is not fit to set up, to be looked at, or
to be made use of;

wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed; which were in his loins,
and were begotten by him in captivity; see [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md); and so said to be cast out with
him, when he was cast out of the land of Judea; just as Levi paid tithes
in Abraham before he was born, [Heb
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#009.md);

and are cast into a land which they know not? where they had no friends
and acquaintance; doubtless it was for his sins and transgressions, and
those of his people.

O earth, earth, earth,.... Not Coniah himself, an earthly man; but
either the inhabitants of the whole earth, or of the land of Israel; or
rather the earth, on which men dwell, is here called upon as a witness
to what is after said; to rebuke the stupidity of the people, and to
quicken their attention to somewhat very remarkable and worthy of
notice, and therefore the word is repeated three times. Some think
reference is had to the land from which, and that to which, the Jews
removed, and the land of Israel, through which they passed. So the
Targum,

"out of his own land they carried him captive into another land; O land
of Israel, receive the words of the Lord.''

Jarchi mentions another reason of this threefold appellation, because
the land of Israel was divided into three parts, Judea, beyond Jordan,
and Galilee;

hear the word of the Lord; which follows.

[Jeremiah 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 22:30</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord, write ye this man childless,.... That is, Coniah,
or Jeconiah; who though he had children in the captivity, yet they died
in it, or however never succeeded him in the throne. This, to show the
certainty of the thing, the Lord would have written. The speech is
directed, as some think, to the angels, or to the prophets; though the
words may be rendered impersonally, "let this man be written childless",
it may be set down, and taken for a sure and certain thing, as though it
was written with a pen of iron, that he shall be alone, and die without
children, and have none to reign after him;

a man that shall not prosper in his days; he sat but three months and
ten days upon the throne, and all the rest of his days he lived in
captivity, [Ch2 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009.md); so that he was a
very unfortunate prince;

for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting on the throne of David,

and ruling any more in Judah; none of them were so prosperous and happy
as to arrive to the royal dignity, or to sit on the throne of David, and
be kings of Judah. Here ended the race of kings of the house of David,
until the King Messiah came; for though there were of his line that were
governors of Judah, as Zerubbabel, yet not kings. Moreover, Jeconiah was
the last of the house of David in the line of Solomon. Salathiel, of
whom was Zerubbabel governor of Judah, was the son of Neri, who
descended from Nathan the son of David; see [Luk
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#029.md), compared with [Mat
