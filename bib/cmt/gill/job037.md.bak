### [Job Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO JOB 37

Elihu in this chapter proceeds to show the greatness of God as it
appears in other of his works of nature, which greatly affected him, and
to an attention to which he exhorts others, [Job
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001.md); particularly thunder and
lightning, the direction, extent, and order of which he observes, [Job
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#003.md); and then suggests that besides
these there are other great things done by him, incomprehensible and
unknown in various respects; as the snow, and rain, lesser and greater,
which come on the earth at his command, and have such effect on men as
to seal up their hands, and on the beasts of the field as to cause them
to retire to their dens, and there remain, [Job
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#005.md); and then he goes on to take
notice of wind, and frost, and the clouds, and dispersion of them; their
use and ends, whether in judgment or mercy, [Job
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#009.md); and then calls on Job to
consider these wondrous works of God, and remark how ignorant men are of
the disposition of clouds for the rainbow; of the balancing of them; of
the heat and quietness that come by the south wind, and of the firmness
of the sky, [Job 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#014.md); and from all
this he concludes the terrible majesty, unsearchable nature of God, the
excellency of his power and justice; and that men therefore should and
do fear him, who is no respecter of persons, [Job
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md).

[Job 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 37:1</span></span>

At this also my heart trembleth,.... At the greatness and majesty of
God, not only as displayed in those works of his before observed, but as
displayed in those he was about to speak of: such terrible majesty is
there with God, that all rational creatures tremble at it; the nations
of the world, the kings and great men of the earth, and even the devils
themselves, [Isa 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002.md). Good men
tremble in the worship of God, and at the word of God; and even at the
judgments of God on wicked men, and at the things that are coming on the
churches of Christ. But Elihu has a particular respect to thunder and
lightning, which are very terrible to many persons (s), both good and
bad (t). At the giving of the law, there were such blazes of lightning
and claps of thunder, that not only all the people of Israel in the camp
trembled, but Moses himself also exceedingly feared and quaked, [Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md). It is very probable, that at
this time Elihu saw a storm gathering, and a tempest rising; some
flashes of lightning were seen, and some murmurs (u) of thunders heard,
which began to affect him; since quickly after we read that God spoke
out of the whirlwind or tempest, [Job
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001.md);

and is moved out of his place; was ready to leap out of his body. Such
an effect had this phenomenon of nature on him; as is sometimes the case
with men at a sudden fright or unusual sound, and particularly thunder
(w).

who always carried about with him the skin of a sea calf, as a
preservative; and, on suspicion of a storm rising, would betake himself
to some secret and covered place: and to Tiberius, who wore his laurel
to secure him from it: and to Caligula, who, on hearing it, would get
out of bed and hide himself under it. Sueton. Vit. August. c. 90. Tiber.

[Job 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 37:2</span></span>

Hear attentively the noise of his voice,.... Of the voice of God in the
clouds; and of thunder, which is his voice, [Job
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#009.md). Elihu being affected with it
himself, exhorts the company about him to hearken and listen to it, and
learn something from it;

and the sound that goeth out of his mouth: as the former clause may have
respect to loud thunder, a more violent crack or clap of it; so this may
intend some lesser whispers and murmurs of it at a distance; or a
rumbling noise in the clouds before they burst; since the word is
sometimes used for private meditation. Now the voice of God, whether in
his works of nature, or in the dispensations of his providence, or in
his word; whether in the thunder of the law, or in the still sound of
the Gospel, is to be attentively hearkened to; because it is the voice
of God, the voice of the God of glory, majestic and powerful, and is
attended with various effects; of which see [Psa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md).

[Job 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 37:3</span></span>

He directeth it under the whole heaven,.... His voice of thunder, which
rolls from one end of the heaven to the other: he charges the clouds
with it, and directs both it and them where they shall go and discharge;
what tree, house, or man, it shall strike; and where the rain shall fall
when the clouds burst: yet Pliny (x) atheistically calls thunder and
lightning chance matters. Thus the ministers of the word, who are
compared to clouds, [Isa 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md), are
charged with it by the Lord: they are directed by him what they shall
say, where they shall go and declare it, and he directs where it shall
fall with power and weight; yea, he directs it into the very hearts of
men, where it pierces and penetrates, and is a discerner and discoverer
of their thoughts and intents;

and his lightning unto the ends of the earth: it cometh out of the east,
and shineth to the west, [Mat 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027.md);
and swiftly move to the further parts of the earth: and such a
direction, motion, and extent, has the Gospel had; the glorious light of
it, comparable to lightning, it first broke forth in the east, where
Christ, his forerunner and his disciples, first preached it, and
Christian churches were formed; and from thence it spread into the
western parts of the world, and before the destruction of Jerusalem it
was preached unto all nations; it had a free course, ran, and was
glorified; the sound of the voice of it went into all the earth, and the
words and doctrines of the apostles unto the ends of the world.

\(x\) Nat. Hist. l. 2. c. 43.

[Job 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 37:4</span></span>

After it a voice roareth,.... After the lightning comes a violent crack
or clap of thunder, which is like the roaring of a lion. Such is the
order of thunder and lightning, according to our sense and apprehension
of them; otherwise in nature they are together: but the reasons given
why the lightning is seen before, and so the same in the flash and
report of a gun, are, because the sense of seeing is quicker than the
sense of hearing (y); and the motion of light is quicker than that of
sound; which latter is the truest reason (z). The roaring voice of
thunder may be an emblem of the thunder of the law; its dreadful volleys
of curses, vengeance, and wrath on the breakers of it, as delivered out
by Boanergeses, sons of thunder, [Mar
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md), or the loud proclamation of the
Gospel, made by the ministers of it; and the alarming awakening sound of
the word, when attended with the Spirit and power of God, to sinners
asleep and dead in trespasses and sins; upon which they awake, hear, and
live;

he thundereth with the voice of his excellency: that is, God thunders
with such a voice, an excellent and majestic one; for his voice of
thunder is full of majesty, [Psa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004.md).
So is the voice of Christ in the Gospel; he spake when on earth as one
having authority, and he comes forth and appears in it now with majesty
and glory; and speaks in it of the excellent things which he has done,
of the excellent righteousness he has wrought out, of the excellent
sacrifice he has offered up, and of the excellent salvation he is the
author of;

and he will not stay them when his voice is heard; either the thunder
and the lightning, as some; which he does not long defer after he has
given out the decree concerning them, the order and disposition for
them: or rather the rain and hail; these are not stayed, but quickly
follow the flash of lightning and clap of thunder: "for when he utters
his voice of thunder, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens";
and these quickly come down and are not stopped, [Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013.md). The word for "stay" signifies
"to supplant", or "act deceitfully"; the name of Jacob is derived from
this root, because he supplanted his brother, [Gen
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#026.md); and so it may be rendered here,
"he will not supplant", or "deceive them (a), when his voice is heard":
that is, either he does not subvert them, the heavens and earth, but
preserves them; though he makes them to tremble with his voice of
thunder (b): or he does not act the part of a secret, subtle, and
deceitful enemy, when he thunders; but shows himself openly as a King,
executing his decrees with authority (c): or rather he deceives none
with his voice; none can mistake it; all know it to be the voice of
thunder when it is heard: so Christ's sheep know his voice in the
Gospel, and cannot be deceived; the voice of a stranger they will not
follow, [Joh 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004.md).

\(y\) Senec. Nat. Quaest. l. 2. c. 12. so Aristot. Meteorolog. l. 2. c.

flash, that is, about half a quarter of a minute; but sometimes much
sooner, in a second or two, or less than so, and almost immediately upon
the flash: this is when the explosion is very near us. Philosoph.

[Job 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 37:5</span></span>

God thundereth marvellously with his voice,.... Or "marvels" (c), or
marvellous things, which may respect the marvellous effects of thunder
and lightning: such as rending rocks and mountains; throwing down high
and strong towers; shattering to pieces high and mighty oaks and cedars,
and other such like effects, mentioned in [Psa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md); and there are some things
reported which seem almost incredible, were they not well attested
facts; as that an egg should be consumed thereby, and the shell unhurt;
a cask of liquor, the liquor in it spoiled, and the cask not touched;
money melted in the purse, and the purse whole; the fetus in the womb
killed, and the woman preserved; with other things of the like kind
mentioned by various writers (d); and which are to be accounted for only
by the swift motion and piercing and penetrating nature of lightning. So
the voice of God in the Gospel thunders out and declares many wonderful
things; as the doctrines of the trinity of Persons in one God; of the
everlasting love of the three Persons; of the Person of Christ, and the
union of the two natures in him; of his incarnation, of redemption and
salvation by him; of regeneration by the spirit of God; of union to
Christ, and communion with him; and of the resurrection of the dead: and
it produces marvellous effects, attended with a divine power; as
quickening sinners dead in trespasses and sins; enlightening those who
are darkness itself; bearing down all opposition before it; casting down
the strong holds of sin and Satan, and reducing the most stubborn and
obstinate to the obedience of Christ;

great things doth he, which we cannot comprehend; or "know" (e): great
things in creation, the nature and causes of which lie greatly out of
the reach of man; and which he rather guesses at than knows, and still
less comprehends. Great things in providence; in sustaining all
creatures and providing for them; and in the government of the world,
and in his dispensations in it; his judgments being unsearchable, and
his ways past finding out: and great things in grace; as the salvation
of sinners by Christ, and the conversion of their souls by his Spirit;
and even what is known of them is known but in part and very
imperfectly. This is a transition to other great things done by the
Lord, besides those before mentioned, and particular instances follow.

[Job 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 37:6</span></span>

For he saith to the snow, be thou on the earth,.... In the original it
is, be thou earth: hence one of the Rabbins formed a notion, that the
earth was created from snow under the throne of glory, which is justly
censured by Maimonides (f); for there is a defect of the letter as in
[Ch2 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#030.md); as Aben Ezra observes; and
therefore rightly supplied by us, on the earth. This is one of the great
and incomprehensible things of God. What is the cause of it, how it is
generated, what gives it its exceeding whiteness and its form, we rather
guess at than certainly know; and there are some things relative to it
not easy to be accounted for: as that it should be generated in the
lower region of the air, so near us, and yet be so cold; and be so cold
in its own nature, yet be like a blanket warming to the earth; and that
being so cold, it should fall in hot countries, as in many parts of
Africa, as Leo Africanus asserts (g); and though so easily melted, yet
lies continually upon the top of a burning mountain, Mount Etna, as
observed by Pineda and others. God has his treasures of it, and he
brings it forth from thence; it is at his command, it goes at a word
speaking; it is one of the things that fulfil his word, [Psa
148:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008). And if what Pliny (h.md) says is
true, that snow never falls upon the high seas or main ocean, the
expression here is, with great exactness and propriety, be thou on the
earth. However, this is certain, that to the earth only it is useful,
warming, refreshing, and fructifying; it has a wonderful virtue in it to
fatten the earth. Olaus Magnus (i) reports, that in the northern
countries, where it falls in great plenty, the fields are more fruitful
than any others, and sooner put forth their fruits and increase than
other fields prepared and cultivated with the greatest labour and
diligence: and that they are often obliged to drive off the cattle from
them, lest they should eat too much and burst, the fields and meadows
becoming so luxurious by it; and frequently they mow off the tops of
herbs and grass with their scythes, to prevent their growing too thick.
The word of God, as for its purity, so for its warming, refreshing, and
fructifying nature, is compared unto it, [Isa
55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010.md);

likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength: that
is, God says to these as to the snow, be upon the earth; and they
presently are, whether lesser or larger showers: the lesser or more
gentle, according to Seneca (k), fall in, the winter, and the larger in
spring; the former when the north wind blows, the latter when the south;
but whenever they come, they fall by the direction of God, and at his
command. He and he only gives rain, the vanities of the Gentiles cannot;
and these are sent to water and refresh the earth, and make it fruitful;
for which reason also the word of God is compared thereunto, [Deu
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#012.md). The Targum is,

"to the rain after rain in summer, to ripen the fruits; and to the rain
after the rain, to cause the grass to bud in winter in his strength.''

So a shower of rain in the singular number signifies rain that falls in
summer; and a shower of rain in the plural what falls in winter.

[Job 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 37:7</span></span>

He sealeth up the hand of every man,.... That is, by deep snows and
heavy rains being on the earth; where, as travellers are stopped in
their journeys, and cannot proceed, so various artificers are hindered
from their work, and husbandmen especially from their employment in the
fields; so that their hands are as it were shut up and sealed, that they
cannot work with them. Sephorno interprets this of the fruits and
increase of the earth being produced and brought to perfection by means
of the snow and rain, and so gathered by and into the hands of men;
whereby they are led to observe the work of God and his goodness herein,
and so to love and fear him; which he takes to be the sense of the
following clause,

that all men may know his work; either their own work; what they have to
do at home when they cannot work abroad; or that they may have leisure
to reflect upon their moral ways and works, and consider how deficient
they are: or rather the work of God; that they may know and own the snow
and rain are his work, and depend upon his will; or that they may have
time and opportunity of considering and meditating on the works of God,
in nature, providence, and grace. Some choose to read the words, "that
all men of his work may know" (l); may know him the author of their
beings, and the God of their mercies. For all men are the work of his
hands; he has made them, and not they themselves; and the end of all
God's dealings with them is, that they may know him, fear, serve, and
glorify him.

Then the beasts go into dens,.... When snow and rains are on the earth
in great abundance, then the wild beasts of the field, not being able to
prowl about, betake themselves to dens; where they lie in wait, lurking
for any prey that may pass by, from whence they spring and seize it;

and remain in their places; until the snow and rains are finished. As
for other beasts, Olaus Magnus (m) observes, that when such large snows
fall, that trees are covered with them, and the tender branches bend
under the weight of them, they will come and abide under them, as in
shady places, in great security, sheltered from the cold wind. The
former may put us in mind of great personages, comparable to beasts of
prey for their savageness and cruelty, who, when the day of God's wrath
and vengeance is come, will flee to rocks and mountains, dens and
caverns, there to hide themselves from it; [Rev
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015.md).

Out of the south cometh the whirlwind,.... Or "from the chamber" (n);
from the chamber of the cloud, as Ben Gersom, from the inside of it; or
from the treasury of God, who bringeth the wind out of his treasures;
alluding to chambers where treasures are kept; or from the heavens, shut
up and veiled around with clouds like a pavilion: but because we read of
the chambers of the south, [Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md);
and the southern pole was like a secret chamber, shut up, unseen, and
unknown very much to the ancients; hence we render it, and others
interpret it, of the south; from whence in these countries came
whirlwinds. Hence we read of the whirlwinds of the south, [Isa
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md);

and cold out of the north; cold freezing winds from thence; or "from the
scatterers" (o): Aben Ezra interprets them of stars, the same with the
"Mazzaroth", [Job 38:32](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#032.md); stars
scattered about the Arctic or northern pole, as some: or rather the
northern winds are designed which scatter the clouds, drive away rain,
[Pro 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#023.md); and bring fair weather,
[Job 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022.md). Wherefore Mr. Broughton
renders the word,

"fair weather winds;''

and, in a marginal note,

"the scatterers of clouds (p).''

By the breath of God frost is given,.... By the word of God, as the
Targum; at his command it is, at his word it comes, and at his word it
goes, [Psa 147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015.md); or by his will, as
Ben Gersom interprets it, when it is his pleasure it should be, it
appears; it may be understood of a freezing wind from the Lord, for a
wind is sometimes expressed by the breath of his nostrils, [Psa
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015.md); and as the word "God" added to
things increases the signification of them, as mountains of God are
strong mountains; so the breath of God may signify a strong wind, as
Sephorno notes, the north wind (q);

and the breadth of the waters is straitened; by the frost they are
reduced and brought into a narrower compass; or made hard, as Mr.
Broughton renders it; so hard as to walk upon, to draw carriages on, and
lay weights and burdens very great upon; or become compact or bound
together, like metal melted, poured out, and consolidated; though some
think it refers to the thawing of ice by the south winds (r), when the
waters return to their former breadth; which is done by the breath or
commandment of God, as appears from the place before quoted from the
psalmist, [Psa 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015.md); for it may be
rendered, "and the breadth of the waters is pouring out", so the Targum,
when thawed; or through the pouring down of rain, so the Syriac and
Arabic versions, "he sends forth plenty of water".

Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud,.... By filling it with a
multitude of water, it is as it were loaded and made weary with it; and
especially by sending it about thus loaded from place to place before
discharged, when it becomes as a weary traveller; and then by letting
down the water in it, whereby it spends itself like one that is weary;
an emblem of ministers that spend and are spent for the good of men:
some render it by serenity or fair weather, and so Mr. Broughton,

"by clearness he wearieth the thick vapours;''

by causing a clear sky he dispels them;

he scattereth his bright cloud; thin light clouds that have nothing in
them, and are soon dispersed and come to nothing, and are seen no more;
all emblem of such as are clouds without water, [Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012.md); see [Zac
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017.md); or "he scatters the cloud by
his light" (s); by the sun, which dispels clouds and makes a clear sky;
an emblem of the blotting out and forgiveness of sins, and of restoring
the manifestations of divine love, and the joys of salvation; see [Isa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022.md).

And it is turned round about by his counsels,.... The cloud is, and that
by the wind, which is turned about to all points of the compass,
according to the will of God; by the counsels of him who sits at the
helm, as the word signifies, and orders all things according to the
counsel of his own will: to which owing every shifting of the wind, and
the various motions of the clouds;

that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the
world in the earth; as all his creatures do; the several meteors in the
air, clouds, stormy wind, fire, hail, snow, and vapour, all fulfilling
his word; and which they do everywhere in the several parts of the world
whither they are sent, [Psa 107:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#025.md). So
ministers of the word drop down or withhold the rain of Gospel doctrine,
and carry it into the several places of the world, as the Lord directs
them; see [Isa 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md).

[Job 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 37:13</span></span>

He causeth it to come,.... The cloud, and rain by it;

whether for correction; for the reproof and chastisement of men for
their sins, by suffering such quantities to fall as wash away, or
corrupt and destroy, the fruits of the earth: or "for a tribe" (t), as
the word sometimes signifies; the rain is sent, and comes only to a
particular part or spot of ground, to one city and not to another, [Amo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007.md);

or for his land; some particular land he has a favour for, as the land
of Canaan he cared for from one end of the year to another, and
therefore sent on it rain in due season, though as yet it did not appear
to be the object of his peculiar regard; or for the whole earth, which
is his; and wherever rain comes seasonably and in proper quantity, it is
for the benefit of it; though some think the land which no man has a
property in but the Lord is meant, even the wilderness where no man is,
[Job 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#026.md);

or for mercy; to some particular spot, and to some particular persons;
and indeed it is a kindness and benefit both to good and bad men; hereby
the earth is watered and made fertile and fruitful, to bring forth seed
to the sower and bread to the eater, see [Mat
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md); the word of God is for the
correction of some, and for the comfort of others, [Ti2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md); yea, the savour of death unto
death to some, and the savour of life unto life to others, [Co2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md). The Targum paraphrases the
words,

"either a rain of vengeance on the seas and deserts, or an impetuous
rain on the trees of the mountains and hills, or a still rain of mercy
on the fruitful fields and vineyards.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 37:14</span></span>

Hearken unto this, O Job,.... Either to the present clap of thunder then
heard; or rather to what Elihu had last said concerning clouds of rain
coming for correction or mercy; and improve it and apply it to his own
case, and consider whether the afflictions he was under were for the
reproof and correction of him for sin, or in mercy and love to his soul
and for his good, as both might be the case; or to what he had further
to say to him, which was but little more, and he should conclude;

stand still; stand up, in order to hear better, and in reverence of what
might be said; and with silence, that it might be the better received
and understood:

and consider the wondrous works of God; not prodigies and extraordinary
things, which are out of the common course of nature, such as the
wonders in Egypt, at the Red sea, in the wilderness, and in the land of
Canaan, but common things; such as come more or less under daily
observation, for of such only he had been speaking, and continued to
speak; such as winds, clouds, thunder, lightning, hail, rain, and snow;
these he would have him consider and reflect upon, that though they were
so common and obvious to view, yet there were some things in them
marvellous and beyond the full comprehension of men; and therefore much
more must be the works of Providence, and the hidden causes and reasons
of them.

[Job 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 37:15</span></span>

Dost thou know when God disposed them?.... The clouds, that part of the
wondrous works of God he was speaking of; when he decreed concerning
them that they should be, when he put into them and stored them with
rain, hail, snow, &c. disposed of them here and there in the heavens,
and gave them orders to fall on this and the other spot of ground; wast
thou present at all this, and knew what God was doing secretly in the
clouds, and before heard what would break out of them, or fall from
them? and if thou art ignorant of these things, canst thou imagine that
thou shouldest be made acquainted with the secret springs of God's
providential dealings with the children of men?

and caused the light of his cloud to shine; either the lightning to
break through the cloud, or rather the light of the sun to shine upon
his cloud, prepared to receive the light reflected on it, and form the
rainbow; which, as it is called his bow, the cloud in which it is may be
called his cloud; which is one of the wondrous works of God, and is
called by the Heathens the daughter of wonder (u); formed in a
semicircle, with various colours, and as a token that God will drown the
earth no more; an emblem of the covenant of peace, and of Jesus Christ,
said to be clothed with a cloud, and with a rainbow about his head, [Rev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001.md).

Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds?.... How those ponderous
bodies, as some of them are very weighty, full of water, are poised, and
hang in the air, without turning this way or the other, or falling on
the earth;

the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge; of God, who is
a God of knowledge, of knowledges, [Sa1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003.md); who knows himself and all his
works, all creatures and things whatever, see [Job
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#004.md); and this is another of his
wondrous works, which none but he, whose knowledge is perfect, and is
the author and giver of knowledge, can know, even the poising and
balancing of the clouds in the air; we see they are balanced, but we
know not how it is done.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 37:17</span></span>

How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
One should think there is no great difficulty in accounting for this,
that a man's clothes should be warm, and he so hot as not to be able to
bear them, but obliged to put them off in the summer season, when only
the south wind blows, which brings heat, a serene sky, and fine weather,
[Luk 12:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#055.md); and yet there is something
in the concourse of divine Providence attending these natural causes,
and his blessing with them, without which the garment of a man will not
be warm, or at least not warming to him, [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md); or

"how thy garments are warm when the land is still from the south,''

as Mr. Broughton renders the words; that is, how it is when the earth is
still from the whirlwinds of the south; or when that wind does not blow
which brings heat, but northerly winds in the winter time; that then a
man's garments should be warm, and keep him warm.

[Job 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 37:18</span></span>

Hast thou with him spread out the sky?.... Wast thou concerned with him
at the first spreading out of the sky? wast thou an assistant to him in
it? did he not spread it as a curtain or canopy about himself, without
the help of another? verily he did; see [Job
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008.md), [Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024.md);

which is strong: for though it seems a fluid and thin, is very firm and
strong, as appears by what it bears, and are contained in it; and
therefore is called "the firmament of his power", [Psa
150:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001.md);

and as a molten looking glass; clear and transparent, like the looking
glasses of the women, made of molten brass, [Exo
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008); and firm and permanent (u.md); and
a glass this is in which the glory of God, and his divine perfections,
is to be seen; and is one of the wondrous works of God, made for the
display of his own glory, and the benefit of men, [Psa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md). Or this may respect the
spreading out a clear serene sky, and smoothing it after it has been
covered and ruffled with storms and tempests; which is such a wonderful
work of God, that man has no hand in.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 37:19</span></span>

Teach us what we shall say unto him,.... To this wonder working God, of
whose common works of nature we know so little; how we should reason
with him about his works of Providence, when we know so little of these:

for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness; by reason of
darkness in themselves, which is in all men naturally, and even in the
saints in this state of imperfection; and by reason of the clouds and
darkness which are about the Lord himself, who is incomprehensible in
his nature and perfections; and by reason of the darkness cast about his
providential dealings with men, so that they are unsearchable and past
finding out; and the best of men are at a loss how to order their
speech, or discourse with God concerning these things.

[Job 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 37:20</span></span>

Shall it be told him that I speak?.... And what I speak? there is no
need of it, since he is omniscient, and knows every word that is spoken
by men; or is anything I have said concerning him, his ways, and his
works, worthy relating, or worthy of his hearing, being so very
imperfect? nor can the things I have spoken of, though common things, be
fully explained to any; or should it be told him, the Lord, that he,
Elihu, had spoke as Job had done, and arraigned his justice, and
complained of his dealings? God forbid; he would not have it said they
were spoken by him for all the world: or "shall it be recorded unto him
what I speak?" as Mr. Broughton, or that I speak; shall it be recorded
in a book, and that sent to God; that I will speak in thy cause, and be
an advocate for thee, and endeavour to justify thee in all thou hast
said? no, by no means;

if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up; if he speaks of the
being and perfections of God, he is soon lost; his essence, and many of
his attributes, are beyond his comprehension; if he speaks of his works
of nature and providence, he is presently out of his depth; there is a
bathos, a depth in them he cannot fathom: if he speaks of his love, and
grace, and mercy, in the salvation of man, he is swallowed up with
admiration; he is obliged to say, what manner of love is this? it has
heights he cannot reach, depths he cannot get to the bottom of, lengths
and breadths immeasurable: or should he undertake to dispute with God,
to litigate a point with him concerning his works, he could not answer
him in one thing of a thousand; and particularly Elihu suggests, was he
to undertake Job's cause, it would soon be lost and all over with him;
so Mr. Broughton renders the words, "would any plead, when he should be
undone?" who would engage in a cause he is sure would be lost, and prove
his utter undoing?

[Job 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 37:21</span></span>

And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds,.... Here
Elihu returns to his subject, it may be, occasioned by black clouds
gathering in the heavens, as a preparation for the whirlwind, storm, and
tempest, out of which the Lord is said to speak in the next chapter. And
this is to be understood, not of the lightning in the cloud, which is
not to be seen until it breaks out of it; nor the rainbow in the cloud,
formed by the rays of light from the sun, which disappears when the wind
passes and clears the sky of the cloud in which it is; nor of the
Galaxy, or Milky Way, as Sephorno, which is not to be seen in a cloudy
night; but of the sun, which is the great light and a bright one, and
shines brightly; yet sometimes not to be seen by men, because of
interposing clouds, until they are cleared away by winds. Though rather
this respects the sun shining in its brightness, and in its full
strength, in the skies or ethereal regions, in a clear day, when men are
not able to look full at it: and how much less then are they able to
behold him who is light itself, and in whom is no darkness at all, nor
shadow of turning; who dwells in light, which no mortal can approach
unto; into whose nature and perfections none can fully look, or behold
the secret springs of his actions, and the reasons of his dispensations
towards men?

but the wind passeth and cleanseth them; the clouds, and clears the air
of them, which obstruct the light of the sun: or "when a wind passeth
and cleareth it"; the air, as Mr. Broughton, then the sun shines so
brightly that it dazzles the eye to look at it.

[Job 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 37:22</span></span>

Fair weather cometh out of the north,.... Or "gold" (x), which some
understand literally; this being found in northern climates as well as
southern, as Pliny relates (y); particularly in Colchis and Scythia,
which lay to the north of Palestine and Arabia; and is thought by a
learned man (z) to be here intended: though to understand it
figuratively of the serenity of the air, bright and pure as gold, or of
fair weather, which is golden weather, as Mr. Broughton renders it,

"through the north the golden cometh,''

seems best to agree with the subject Elihu is upon; and such weather
comes from the north, through the north winds, which drive away rain,
[Pro 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#023.md);

with God is terrible majesty; majesty belongs to him as he is King of
kings, whose the kingdom of nature and providence is; and he is the
Governor among and over the nations of the world. His throne is prepared
in the heavens; that is his throne, and his kingdom ruleth over all: and
this majesty of his is "terrible", commanding awe and reverence among
all men, who are his subjects; and especially among his saints and
peculiar people; and strikes a terror to others, even to great
personages, the kings and princes of the earth; to whom the Lord is
sometimes terrible now, and will be hereafter; see [Psa
76:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#012.md), [Rev
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015.md); and to all Christless sinners,
especially when he comes to judgment; see [Isa
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019). Or "terrible praise" (a.md); for
God is "fearful in praises", [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md); which may respect the subject
of praise, terrible things, and the manner of praising him with fear and
reverence, [Psa 106:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#022.md).

Touching the Almighty,.... Or with respect to God, who is almighty; with
whom nothing is impossible; who can do and does do all things he
pleases, and more than we can ask or think; and who is all sufficient,
as this word is by some rendered; has enough of every thing in himself
and of himself to make him happy; and needs not any of his creatures,
nor anything they can do or give him, but has a sufficiency for himself
and them;

we cannot find him out; found he may be in his works, and especially in
his Son, the express image of his person; in whom he makes himself known
as the God of grace: but he is not to be found out to perfection;
neither by the light of nature, which is very dim, and by which men
grope after him, if haply they may find him; nor even by the light of
grace in the present state: and there are many things in God quite out
of the reach of man, and ever will be, fully to comprehend; as the modes
of the subsistence of the three Persons in the Godhead; the eternity and
immensity of God; with all secret things, which belong not to us to
inquire curiously into;

he is excellent in power; or great and much in it; which is displayed in
the works of creation and sustentation of the world; in the redemption
and conversion of his people; in the support, protection, and
preservation of them; and in the destruction of his and their enemies;

and in judgment; in the government of the world in so righteous a
manner; in the judgments he executes on wicked men; and as he will
appear to be in the general judgment of the world, at the great day,
which will be a righteous one;

and in plenty of justice; being most just, righteous in all his ways,
and holy in all his works; distributing justice to all, acting according
to the rules of it, in all things and towards all persons; so that
though he is great in power, he does not abuse that power, to do things
that are not just;

he will not afflict; without a just cause and reason for it; nor
willingly, but with reluctance; nor never beyond deserts, nor more than
he gives strength to bear; and only for the good of his people, and in
love to them. Some render it, "he will not answer" (b); or give an
account of his matters, or the reason of his dealings with men.

Men do therefore fear him,.... Or should, because of his greatness in
power, judgment, and justice; and because of his goodness, in not
afflicting for his pleasure's sake, but for the profit of men; and
therefore they should reverence and adore him, submit to his will,
patiently bear afflictions, serve him internally and externally, with
reverence and godly fear;

he respecteth not any that are wise of heart; that are wise in a natural
sense: these are not always regarded by God, or are his favourites;
neither temporal blessings, nor special grace, or the knowledge of
spiritual things, are always given to the wise and prudent, [Ecc
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md). Or that are wise in their own
conceit; there is a woe to such; and there is more hope of a fool than
of him, [Isa 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#021.md). Or he is not
"afraid" of them (c), as some choose to render the word; he fears not to
reprove them and correct them for their faults, or the schemes they form
to counterwork him; for he can take them in their craftiness, and carry
their counsel headlong. Or "every wise in heart shall not see him" (d):
the world by wisdom knows him not; nor can any look into his heart, his
thoughts, purposes, and designs, and into the causes and reasons of his
actions; nor have those that are truly wise perfect vision and knowledge
of him now, [Co1 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#009.md).
