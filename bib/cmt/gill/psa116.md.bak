INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 116

Theodoret applies this psalm to the distresses of the Jews in the times
of the Maccabees under Antiochus Epiphanes; and R. Obadiah interprets
some passages in it of the Grecians of those times; but it rather seems
to have been written by David on account of some troubles of his, out of
which he was delivered; and refers either to the times of Saul, and the
persecutions he endured from him, particularly when he was beset round
about by him and his men in the wilderness of Maon, [Sa1
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#026.md), to which he may have respect
[Psa 116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md). The inscription of the
psalm in the Syriac version is,

"the progress of the new people returning to the Christian worship, as a
child to understanding: and as to the letter, it was said when Saul
stayed at the door of the cave where David lay hid with his men;''

see [Sa1 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#004.md). But since mention is
made of Jerusalem, [Psa 116:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#019.md), where
the psalmist would praise the Lord for his deliverance, which as yet was
not in his hands nor in the hands of the Israelites, but of the
Jebusites; some have thought it was written on account of the conspiracy
of Absalom against him, and who, hearing that Ahithophel was among the
conspirators, said the words related in [Psa
116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011.md), it is very probable it was
composed after the death of Saul, and when he was settled in the
kingdom, as Jarchi observes, and was delivered out of the hands of all
his enemies; and very likely much about the same time as the eighteenth
psalm was, which begins in the same manner, and has some expressions in
it like to what are in this. David was a type of Christ, and some apply
this psalm to him.

[Psalms 116:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 116:1</span></span>

I love the Lord,.... As the Messiah, David's antitype, did; of which he
gave the fullest proof by his obedience to his will; and as David, the
man after God's own heart, did, and as every good man does; and the Lord
is to be loved for the perfections of his nature, and especially as they
are displayed in Christ, and salvation by him; and for his works of
creation, providence, and grace, and particularly for his great love
shown in redemption, regeneration, and other blessings of grace, as well
as for what follows.

Because he hath heard my voice and my supplication; in the original text
the words lie thus, "I love, because the Lord hath heard", or "will
hear"; and so read the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin, Ethiopic, Syriac,
and Arabic versions, and so the Targum; and may be rendered, "I love
that the Lord should hear me", so the Syriac and Arabic versions;
nothing is more desirable and grateful to good men than that the Lord
should hear them; but Kimchi and others transpose the words as we do,
which gives a reason why he loved the Lord; because he heard his
prayers, which were vocal, put up in a time of distress, in an humble
and submissive manner, under the influence of the Spirit of grace and
supplication, in the name of Christ, for his righteousness sake, and
through his mediation; and such supplications are heard and answered by
the Lord, sooner or later; and which engages the love of his people to
him; see [Psa 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md). It may be applied
to Christ, who offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying
and tears, and was always heard; and for which he thanked his Father and
loved him, [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 116:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 116:2</span></span>

Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,.... Not as hard of hearing,
for his ear is not heavy that it cannot hear; he is quick of hearing,
and his ears are always open to the righteous; it rather denotes his
readiness to hear; he hearkens and hears, he listens to what his people
say, and hears them at once, and understands them, though ever so broken
and confused; when their prayers are but like the chatterings of a crane
or swallow, or only expressed in sighs and groans, and even without a
voice; when nothing is articulately pronounced: moreover, this shows
condescension in him; he bows his ear as a rattler to a child, he stoops
as being above them, and inclines his ear to them.

Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live; or "in my days" (d);
in days of adversity and affliction, for help and relief; in days of
prosperity, with thankfulness for favours received; every day I live,
and several times a day: prayer should be constantly used; men should
pray without ceasing always, and not faint; prayer is the first and last
action of a spiritual life; it is the first thing a regenerate man does,
"behold, he prays"; as soon as he is born again he prays, and continues
praying all his days; and generally goes out of the world praying, as
Stephen did, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit"; and it is the Lord's
hearing prayer that encourages his people to keep on praying, and which
makes the work delightful to them. Christ was often at this work in
life, and died praying, [Luk 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 116:3</span></span>

The sorrows of death compassed me,.... Christ, of whom David was a type,
was a man of sorrows all his days; and in the garden he was surrounded
with sorrow; exceeding sorrowful even unto death, in a view of the sins
of his people imputed to him, and under a sense of wrath for them, he
was about to bear; and his agonies in the article of death were very
grievous, he died the painful and accursed death of the cross. This was
true of David, when Saul and his men compassed him on every side,
threatening to cut him off in a moment; when he despaired of life, and
had the sentence of death in himself, and saw no way to escape; and such
a case is that of the people of God, or they may be said to be compassed
about with the sorrows of death, when through a slavish fear of it they
are all their lifetime subject to bondage; and especially when under
dreadful apprehensions of eternal death.

And the pains of hell gat hold upon me; or "found me" (e); overtook him,
and seized upon him; meaning either the horrors of a guilty conscience
under a sense of sin, without a view of pardon; which is as it were a
hell in the conscience, and like the pains and torments of it: or "the
pains of the grave" (f); not that there are any pains felt there, the
body being destitute of life, and senseless; but such sorrows or
troubles are meant which threaten to bring down to the grave, which was
the case of Jacob on the loss of his children, [Gen
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#035.md). This applied to Christ may
design the wrath of God and curse of the law, which he endured in the
room and stead of his people, as their surety; and which were equivalent
to the pains of the damned in hell; or it may refer to his being laid in
the grave, in a strait and narrow place, as the word (g) signifies;
where he lay bound in grave clothes, till he was loosed from the pains
and cords of death, it being not possible he should be held by them,
[Act 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024.md); see Gill on [Psa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md), [Psa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md).

I found trouble and sorrow; without seeking for them; they seized and
took hold of him, on David, and his antitype, when in the above
circumstances; and often do the saints find trouble and sorrow from a
body of sin and death, from the temptations of Satan, divine desertions,
and afflictive providences. Aben Ezra refers the one to the body, the
other to the soul.

[Psalms 116:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 116:4</span></span>

Then called I upon the name of the Lord,.... Upon the Lord himself in
prayer for speedy deliverance; or "in the name of the Lord" (h), in the
name of the Messiah, the only Mediator between God and man; "saying", as
follows, and which word may be supplied,

O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul; from these sorrows and pains,
from these afflictions and distresses, from death and the grave, and
from wrath, and a sense of it, and fears about it.

[Psalms 116:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 116:5</span></span>

Gracious is the Lord,.... So the psalmist found him, calling upon him;
so he is in Christ, the author and giver of all grace, to help in time
of need.

And righteous; faithful to his promises, just in every dispensation of
his providence, even in afflictive ones; righteous in punishing the
enemies of his people, and in saving, justifying, and pardoning them for
Christ's sake.

Yea, our God is merciful; compassionate, tenderhearted, a heart full of
pity, as a father to his child; and sympathizes with his people under
all their afflictions, and saves them out of them; see [Psa
86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005.md).

[Psalms 116:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 116:6</span></span>

The Lord preserveth the simple,.... Such as have but a small degree of
understanding, either in things natural or spiritual, in comparison of
others; babes, as the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and
Ethiopic versions render it, so in the Talmud (i); see [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md). Such who are sensible of their
lack of wisdom, and what they have they do not lean unto or trust in,
but being sensible of their weakness commit themselves to the Lord; they
are sincere and upright, harmless and inoffensive, artless and
incautious, and so easily imposed upon by designing men; but the Lord
preserves them, as from sin, from a total and final falling away by it,
so from gross errors and heresies; he preserves them from the snares and
pollutions of the world, and from the temptations of Satan, so as not to
be overcome with them; he preserves them by his Spirit, power, and
grace, safe to his kingdom and glory.

I was brought low and he helped me; the psalmist returns to his own
case, and gives an instance of the divine goodness in himself; he had
been brought low by affliction of body, by distress of enemies, through
want of the necessaries and conveniences of life; he had been brought
low as to spiritual things, through the weakness of grace, the
prevalence of corruption, the temptations of Satan, and the hidings of
God's face; but the Lord helped him to bear up under all this; he put
underneath his everlasting arms, and upheld him with the right hand of
his righteousness; he helped him out of his low estate, and delivered
him out of all his troubles, when none else could; when things were at
the greatest extremity, and he in the utmost distress, just ready to go
down into silence and dwell there, [Psa
94:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017.md). The Targum is,

"he looked upon me to redeem me.''

\(i\) T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 110. 2.

[Psalms 116:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 116:7</span></span>

Return unto thy rest, O my soul,.... To a quiet and tranquil state after
much distress (k); a soliloquy, an address to his own soul to return to
God his resting place, as Kimchi; or to Christ, whose rest is glorious,
and which lies in a cessation from a man's own works; not from doing
them, but from depending on them, or from labouring for life by them; in
a deliverance from the bondage of the law, its curse and condemnation,
and from the dominion and tyranny of sin, and from the distressing guilt
of it on the conscience; in spiritual peace and joy, arising from the
application of the blood of Christ, and from a view of his righteousness
and justification by it, and of his sacrifice, and of the expiation of
sin by that; which is enjoyed in the ways and ordinances of Christ, and
oftentimes amidst afflictions and tribulations: this is sometimes broke
in upon and interrupted, through the prevalence of sin, the temptations
of Satan, and divine desertions; but may be returned to again, as Noah's
dove returned to the ark when it could find rest nowhere else; as the
believer can find none but in Christ, and therefore after he has
wandered from him he returns to him again, encouraged by the following
reason.

For the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee; in times past, even in an
eternity past, having loved him with an everlasting love, chosen him in
Christ, made a covenant with him in him, blessed him with all spiritual
blessings in him, and made unto him exceeding great and precious
promises; provided a Redeemer and Saviour for him, whom he had made
known unto him, having enlightened, quickened, and converted him; and
had laid up good things for him to come, and had done many great things
for him already; all which might serve to encourage his faith and hope
in him. The Targum is,

"because the Word of the Lord hath rendered good unto me.''

[Psalms 116:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 116:8</span></span>

For thou hast delivered my soul from death,.... From a corporeal death,
when his life was in danger, surrounded by Saul's army, in the hand of
the Philistines at Gath, and when his son rebelled against him; and from
a spiritual death in regeneration, which is a passing from death to
life; and from an eternal death, the just wages of sin: and not only so,
but even

mine eyes from tears; they were sometimes full of, and shed in great
plenty; he watered his couch with them; and especially when absent from
the worship of the Lord, and without his presence, which his enemies
sometimes reproached him with; and particularly when he fled before his
rebellious son, and at the death of him; but God dried up all his tears;
see [Psa 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md). Many are the occasions
of the saints weeping as they pass through the valley of "Baca", but God
will wipe away all tears from their eyes.

And my feet from falling through a "push" (l), by an enemy, so as to
fall; the people of God are liable to falling, both into sin and into
calamity; it is the Lord only that keeps them; and which they may expect
from their interest in his love, covenant, and promises, and from their
being in the hands of Christ; see [Psa
56:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 116:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 116:9</span></span>

I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living. As in the sight
of the omniscient God, according to his word and will, and in such
manner as to please him. So Enoch's walking with God is by the apostle
explained of pleasing him; compare [Gen
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md), and so the Septuagint, Vulgate
Latin, and Arabic versions render it, "I will please the Lord"; or, as
the Syriac and Ethiopic versions; "that I may please the Lord"; be
grateful to him; or walk gratefully and acceptably before him, sensible
of the obligations I am under to him: and this, in the strength of
grace, he determined to do "in the land of the living"; in this world,
where men live, and as long as he lived in it; or in the church of God,
among the living in Jerusalem, with whom he resolved to walk in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord. The land of Canaan is thought
by Jarchi and Kimchi to be meant; and this being a type of heaven, the
meaning may be, that he should walk and dwell where living and glorified
saints are to all eternity; and so it is an expression of his faith of
future glory and happiness, agreeably to what follows.

[Psalms 116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 116:10</span></span>

I believed, therefore have I spoken,.... Here the Septuagint, Vulgate
Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, begin a new psalm, but without any
foundation in the original; nor is it countenanced by the Targum; and is
manifestly against the connection with the preceding verses. David
expresses his faith in relation to what goes before, though the
particulars of it are not mentioned, but are left to be supplied from
thence: he not only believed there was a God, but that this God was
gracious and merciful, and that he was his God; who had made a covenant
with him, ordered in all things, and sure: he believed the promises of
it; and particularly the grand promise of it respecting Christ, and
salvation by him: he believed the Lord would deliver him out of all his
troubles; that he should walk before him, and see his goodness in the
land of the living; he believed a future state of happiness he should
hereafter enjoy. The Apostle Paul quotes this passage, and applies it to
himself and other Gospel ministers; declaring their faith in the
resurrection of the dead, and an eternal weight of glory they were
looking for, [Co2 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013.md); and therefore
spake so freely about these things. Faith gives boldness and freedom of
speech to men; which believers use with God in prayer, in the believing
views of him, as their God in Christ; and of Christ, his person, blood,
righteousness, and sacrifice: it gives ministers boldness and freedom to
speak out plainly, constantly, and boldly, the Gospel of Christ; it
gives the same to private Christians, to speak freely one to another of
their gracious experiences, and to declare publicly to the churches of
Christ what God has done for their souls;

I was greatly afflicted; when he believed and spake, and yet
nevertheless did; he might be afflicted, reproached, and persecuted for
his faith, and his speaking of it; particularly as it respected his
coming to the crown and kingdom of Israel. And it is no unusual thing
for saints to be persecuted for their faith, and profession of it; and
yet none of these things move them from it; their faith remains, and is
much more precious than gold that perisheth; and they hold fast the
profession of it. Many and great afflictions are the common lot of
believers.

[Psalms 116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 116:11</span></span>

I said in my haste, all men are liars. The sin of lying is common to
man; there is a natural proneness and propensity to it: men go astray
from the womb, speaking lies; yet such who have received the grace of
God "put it off" with the rest of "the deeds of the old man", and are
"children that will not lie". Wherefore, though the greater part of
mankind might deserve this character, yet all and every individual of
them did not. However degenerate the age was in which David lived, and
the faithful among men were few; yet there were some to whom this
imputation did not belong; and therefore, on cool reflection, he owned
it was said "in haste"; not with thought and deliberation, but rashly
and precipitately, unadvisedly, in a passion, and under a temptation,
and when off of his guard; and which he acknowledged and repented of.
The Targum is,

"I said in my flight;''

when he made haste and fled from Saul, whom he might call a liar and
dissembler, pretending respect to him when he had none; and also his
courtiers; nay, even Samuel himself, who had anointed him, and assured
him he should be king; and yet now he thought he had deceived him, and
he should perish by the hand of Saul, and never come to the kingdom,
[Sa1 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001.md); or when he fled from his
son Absalom, whom he might call a liar, who had deceived him with the
pretence of a vow; and also Ahithophel and others, who proved
treacherous and unfaithful to him. Some take the words in a quite
different sense, as an instance of his great faith; that when he was so
greatly afflicted, and obliged to fly, yet declared that every man that
should say he should not come to the kingdom was a liar; so Kimchi: and
others think his meaning is, that every man is a liar in comparison of
God, who is true and faithful to his promises, and not a man, that he
should lie. Men of both high and low degree are a lie and vanity, and
not to be trusted and depended upon; but a man may safely put confidence
in the Lord; to this agrees [Rom 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md);
where the apostle seems to have some respect to this passage.

[Psalms 116:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 116:12</span></span>

What shall I render unto the Lord?.... He considers the Lord only as the
author and giver of his mercies, and has nothing to say of his own
merits, nor of other persons, who might be instruments of good to him;
but is for giving all the glory to God: not as though he could render
anything proportional or equivalent to what he had received, but as
having a grateful sense of mercies, and willing, to express it; though
at a loss, in a great measure, in what manner to do it, and therefore
puts this question to himself and others:

for all his benefits towards me; or, "all his benefits are upon me" (m).
This being a clause of itself; and shows what moved him to put the
question he did; a sense of divine favours was impressed upon him, a
load of benefits lay on him, and he wanted to ease himself in
expressions of gratitude. These benefits were the blessings of nature
and providence; his being, and the preservation of it, food, raiment,
&c. and the blessings of grace; spiritual blessings, all things
pertaining to life and godliness, sanctification, adoption, pardon,
justification, and eternal life. These may well be called "benefits",
since they spring entirely from the free grace of God; and they were
many, more than could be counted and reckoned up, and set in order
before the Lord; and yet he was desirous that none of them might be
forgotten, but that praise might be rendered to the Lord for them all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 116:13</span></span>

I will take the cup of salvation,.... Or "salvations" (n); not the
eucharistic cup, or the cup in the Lord's supper, which the apostle
calls "the cup of blessing", [Co1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016.md); though some so think, and that
the psalmist represents the saints under the Gospel dispensation; nor
the cup of afflictions or martyrdom for the sake of Christ; being
willing, under a sense of mercies received, to bear or suffer anything
for his sake he should call him to; as knowing it would be a token to
him of salvation, and work for his good: but rather an offering of
praise for temporal salvation, and for spiritual and eternal salvation;
in allusion to a master of a family, who at the close of a feast or
meal, used to take up a cup in his hands, and give thanks; see [Mat
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027.md);

and call upon the name of the Lord; invocation of the name of the Lord
takes in all worship and service of him, public and private, external
and internal; and particularly prayer, which is calling upon the Lord in
the name of Christ, with faith and fervency, in sincerity and truth: and
the sense of the psalmist is, that he would not only give thanks for the
mercies he had received, but continue to pray to God for more; and this
was all the return he was capable of making.

Make good the resolutions and determinations he made in the strength of
divine grace, in the time of his troubles; that should the Lord deliver
him out of them, he would give him all the glory, and offer thanksgiving
and praise to him; and now being delivered, this he declares he would
do, in a public way, before all the people of God, assembled in the

[Psalms 116:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 116:15</span></span>

Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. The Lord
has his saints or sanctified ones, who are sanctified or set apart by
God the Father from all eternity; who are sanctified in Christ, their
head and representative; who are sanctified by his blood, shed for the
expiation of their sins; who are sanctified by his Spirit and grace, are
called with an holy calling, and have principles of holiness wrought in
them, and live holy lives and conversations. The word (o) used also
signifies one that has received kindness and favour, and shows it:
saints are such, who have received spiritual blessings from the Lord; to
whom he has been kind and bountiful; and these are merciful and
beneficent to others. Now these die as well as others, though holy and
righteous, and though Christ has died for them; he has indeed delivered
them from death as a punishment, he has abolished it in this sense; and
has freed them from the curse and sting of it, but not from that itself;
because it is for their good, and it is precious in the sight of the
Lord. Saints are precious to him, living and dying; there is something
in their death, or that attends it, that is delightful to him, and of
high esteem with him; as when they are in the full exercise of grace at
such a season; when they die in faith, and have hope in their death; and
their love is drawn out unto him, and they long to be with him: besides,
they die in the Lord, and sleep in Jesus, in union with him; with whom
he is well pleased, and all in him; and they die unto him, according to
his will, and are resigned unto it; and so glorify him in death, as well
as in life. It is the time of their ingathering to him; at death he
comes into his garden, and gathers his flowers, and smells a sweet
savour in them; their very dust is precious to him, which he takes care
of and raises up at the last day. The commonly received sense of the
words is, that the saints are so dear to the Lord, their lives are so
much set by with him, and their blood so precious to him, that he will
not easily suffer their lives to be taken away, or their blood to be
spilled; and whenever it is, he will, sooner or later, severely revenge
it; see [Sa1 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021.md). And to this sense
is the Targum,

"precious before the Lord is death sent to (or inflicted on) his
saints;''

that is, by men. The words will bear to be rendered, "precious in the
sight of the Lord is that death", or "death itself, for his saints";
that very remarkable and observable death, even the death of his Son,
which was not only for the good of his saints, for their redemption,
salvation, justification, pardon, and eternal life; but in their room
and stead; and which was very acceptable unto God, of high esteem with
him, of a sweet smelling savour to him: not that he took pleasure in it,
simply considered; for he that hath no pleasure in the death of him that
dieth, even of a sinner, could have none in the death of his Son; but as
hereby his justice was satisfied, his law fulfilled, the salvation of
his people procured, and his covenant, counsels, purposes, and decrees,
accomplished. has a double in it; one at the beginning, and the other at
the end of the word; which is very emphatic, and so may point at
something very remarkable; and what more so than the death of Christ?
and is sometimes used for substitution, and signifies "for", "instead",
or "in the room of", another; see [Exo
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 116:16</span></span>

O Lord, truly I am thy servant, I am thy servant,.... Not merely by
creation, and as obliged by providential favours; but by the grace of
God, which made him a willing one: and he was so, not nominally only,
but in reality; not as those who say Lord, Lord, but do not the will of
God; whereas he served the Lord cheerfully and willingly, in
righteousness and true holiness: and this he repeats for the
confirmation of it, and to show his heartiness in the Lord's service,
and his zealous attachment to him; and which he mentions, not as though
he thought his service meritorious of anything at the hand of God; but
that his being in this character was an obligation upon him to serve the
Lord, and him only, and might expect his protection in it;

and the son of thy handmaid; his mother was also a servant of the Lord;
and had trained him up in his infancy in the nurture and admonition of
the Lord; so that he was inured to it early, and could not easily depart
from it;

thou hast loosed my bonds; the bonds of affliction and death in which he
was held; these were loosed, being delivered from them, [Psa
116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md); and the bonds of sin, and
Satan, and the law, in whose service he had been, which was no other
than a bondage; but now was freed from the servitude and dominion of
sin, from the captivity of Satan, and the bondage of the law; and
therefore, though a servant, yet the Lord's free man.

[Psalms 116:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 116:17</span></span>

I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,.... For deliverance
from afflictions and death; for loosing his bonds, in every sense; for
all mercies, temporal and spiritual; see [Rom
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#017.md); Such sacrifices are according to
the will of God; are well pleasing to him, when offered up through
Christ, and in faith, and are a glorifying of him. These are more
acceptable than all ceremonial sacrifices; and therefore the psalmist
determined to offer this, and not them;

and will call upon the name of the Lord; See Gill on [Psa
116:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 116:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 116:18</span></span>

I will pay my vows unto the Lord,.... See Gill on [Psa
116:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#014.md). And the Targum here, as there,
paraphrases the latter clause,

now in the presence of all his people, thus;

"I will then declare his signs (or wonders) to all his people;''

the marvellous things he had done for him.

[Psalms 116:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 116:19</span></span>

In the courts of the Lord's house,.... This is added by way of
explanation of [Psa 116:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#018.md), what he
meant by "the presence of all his people"; the assembly of the saints
met together in the house of the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle, in
the courts of it, where the people got together to worship God;

in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem; the Lord's house or tabernacle; for
as yet the temple was not built, and the courts of it were in the midst
of the city of Jerusalem. And this shows, as some interpreters have
observed, that this psalm must have been written after David came to the
kingdom, and had got this city into his hands, whither he brought the
ark of the Lord. The whole signifies that he would praise the Lord
publicly, as well as privately; and he concludes the psalm thus,

Praise ye the Lord; calling upon the Lord's people, in his house and
courts, to join with him in this work of praise.
