INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 17

This chapter contains an account of David's intention to build an house
for God, which, he signified to Nathan the prophet, who first encouraged
him to it; but afterwards was sent by the Lord to him with an order to
desist from it, assuring him, at the same time, that his son should
build it, and that his own house and kingdom should be established for
ever; for which David expressed great thankfulness, the whole of which
is related in [Sa2 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md) with some
little variation, see the notes there; only one thing has since
occurred, which I would just take notice of, that here, [Ch1
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#005.md) as there also, it is said by the
Lord, that he had "not dwelt in an house since the day he brought up
Israel out of Egypt"; which seems to suggest that he had dwelt in one
before, as has been hinted on [Sa2 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006.md)
even while the people of Israel were in Egypt, though it is nowhere
mentioned by Moses, or any other writer; yet it is not unreasonable to
suppose it; for as the ancestors of the Israelites, Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, when only travellers from place to place, built altars for God
wherever they came; so their posterity, it is highly probable, not only
did the same, but when they found themselves settled in Egypt, in the
land of Goshen, might build places of worship; and when we consider the
wealth of Joseph, and his family, and indeed of all Israel, who enjoyed
for many years great plenty, prosperity, and liberty, before their
servitude, the vast numbers they increased to and the long continuance
of them in Egypt, more than two hundred years; it will not seem strange
that they should build houses for religious worship, and even one grand
and splendid for public service, to which also they might be led by the
example of the Egyptians; who, as Herodotus says (i), were the first
that erected altars, images, and temples to the gods, and who in the
times of Joseph had one at On, where his father-in-law officiated as
priest, [Gen 41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045.md) or rather to this
they might be directed by some hints and instructions of their father
Jacob before his death, who it is certain had a notion of a Bethel, an
house for the public worship of God, [Gen
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#017) and I find a learned man (k.md) of
our own nation of this opinion, and which he founds upon this passage;
and he supposes the house God dwelt in, in Egypt, was not a tent of
goats' hair, as in the wilderness, but a structure of stones or bricks,
a firm and stable house, such an one as Abraham built at Damascus when
settled there; which continued to the times of Augustus Caesar, as
related by Nicholas of Damascus (l). See [Sa2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001).(i.md) Euterpe, sive, l. 2. c. 4.
