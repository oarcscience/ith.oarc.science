INTRODUCTION TO JEREMIAH 46

This chapter contains two prophecies relating to Egypt; one concerning
the overthrow of Pharaohnecho, king of it, which was quickly
accomplished; and the other concerning the destruction of the land,
fulfilled many years after, and both by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;
and the chapter is concluded with a word of comfort to the people of
Israel. It begins with a general title to prophecies in this and the
five following chapters, [Jer 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md);
then follows a particular prophecy of the route of Pharaoh's army; of
the place where, and time when, [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002.md); the preparations of the
Egyptians for the battle, with a variety of warlike instruments, [Jer
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003.md); the consternation, flight, and
destruction of them, [Jer 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005.md);
notwithstanding their confidence of getting the victory, [Jer
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#007.md); the reason of it, because it was
the day of the Lord's vengeance on them, and therefore their ruin was
inevitable, [Jer 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010.md); the
consequence of which was shame and confusion, [Jer
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#012.md); next follows another prophecy
of the destruction of the land itself by Nebuchadnezzar, [Jer
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md); the places that should be
destroyed, [Jer 46:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#014.md); the multitude
that should be slain, [Jer 46:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#015.md); a
description of the calamity; the instrument, manner, and consequence of
it, [Jer 46:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#020.md); the certainty of it,
[Jer 46:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#018.md); and the whole is closed
with a promise of the return of the Jews, and of their salvation; though
they should not be without divine corrections, [Jer
46:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#027.md).

[Jeremiah 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 46:1</span></span>

The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the
Gentiles. Or "nations"; distinguished from the Jews; not all the nations
of the world, but some hereafter mentioned, as the Egyptians,
Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Syrians, Arabians, Persians,
and Chaldeans: or "concerning the nations" (p); the above mentioned;
though the prophecies delivered out concerning them are all against
them, and not in their favour. Mention is made of Jeremiah's prophesying
against all the nations in [Jer 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md);
after which follow the several prophecies contained in the next chapters
in the Septuagint and Arabic versions, as they stand in the Polyglot
Bible.

[Jeremiah 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 46:2</span></span>

Against Egypt,.... This is the title of the first prophecy against
Egypt; which is the first mentioned, because first accomplished; and
because the Jews placed great confidence in and much relied on the
Egyptians for help:

against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt; who is by Herodotus (q)
called Necos; he was the son and successor of Psammitichus, and was
succeeded by his son Psammis; and he by Apries, the same with
Pharaohhophra, [Jer 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md); the Targum
calls this king Pharaoh the lame:

which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish; of which place See Gill
on [Isa 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009.md); this being in the land
of the king of Assyria, as appears from the same place. Pharaohnecho, in
Josiah's time, came up against him, in order to take it from him; but
whether he did or no is not certain; see [Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md); however, he appeared at the
same place a second time, against the king of Babylon, into whose hands
it was now very probably fallen, with the whole Assyrian monarchy; and
here, in this second battle, his army was routed, as follows:

which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; when he took away from the
king of Egypt all that belonged to him between the Nile and Euphrates,
so that he came no more out of his land, [Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007.md). Kimchi and Abarbinel think there
was but one expedition of Pharaohnecho; and that the siege of Carchemish
continued to the fourth year of Jehoiakim; when he met with an entire
overthrow from the king of Babylon, which God suffered as a judgment on
him for killing Josiah. This, according to Bishop Usher, was in the year
of the world 3397, and before Christ 607; and, according to the
Universal History, in the year of the world 3396, and before Christ 608.

[Jeremiah 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 46:3</span></span>

Order ye the buckler and shield,.... Both signify one and the same sort
of armour, only of a different form, the one being lesser and lighter
than the other. Jarchi makes the difference to be, that the former was
made of skin, the latter of wood; they were both used to defend the body
in war. To order them is not only to prepare them, and get them ready;
but to fit them to the body, and to put them on, that they might be in a
readiness to engage in battle. The exhortation is made either to the
Chaldean army, to prepare to fight against the Egyptians; or to the army
of Pharaohnecho, to defend themselves against the king of Babylon, who
was coming against them, as Kimchi and Abarbinel, who seem to be in
doubt which it should be; but the latter is most probable: and it is
either a direction of Pharaoh to his army, to be in readiness; or rather
of God, speaking ironically to them, suggesting, that let them do what
they would, and make ever such preparations for battle, all would come
to nothing, victory would be on the other side;

and draw near to battle; engage the enemy briskly, and with the greatest
courage, and use all your military skill; and, when ye have done, it
will all be in vain.

[Jeremiah 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 46:4</span></span>

Harness the horses,.... Put on their bridles and saddles and gird them:
or, "bind the horses" (r); that is, to the chariots; put them to, as we
commonly express it: Egypt abounded in horses, and so no doubt brought a
large cavalry, and a multitude of chariots, into the field of battle:

and get up, ye horsemen; upon the horses, or into the chariots, and so
be ready to receive the enemy, or to attack him:

and stand forth with your helmets; present themselves on horseback, or
in their chariots, with their helmets on their heads, to cover them in
the day of battle:

furbish the spears; that they may be sharp and piercing, and look bright
and glittering, and strike terror in the enemy:

and put on the brigandines; coats of mail, to cover the whole body,
which were made of iron, consisting of rings, as Kimchi observes.

[Jeremiah 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 46:5</span></span>

Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back?.... The
Egyptians, after all this preparation for war, and seeming ardent to
engage in battle; and yet, when they came to it, were seized with a
panic, and thrown into the utmost consternation, and turned their backs
upon their enemy: these are either the words of the prophet, who had a
view by a spirit of prophecy, of the consternation, confusion, and
flight of the Egyptian army; or of the Lord, who foresaw all this, and
represents it as if it was done because of the certainty of it;
upbraiding the Egyptians with their pusillanimity and cowardice:

and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not
back; or, "their mighty ones are broken" (s); their valiant soldiers and
officers, their best troops were broken to pieces, their ranks and
files, and thrown into the utmost disorder; and therefore made all the
haste they could to escape the fury of the enemy, and fled with the
utmost precipitation, and never stopped to look back upon their
pursuers; so great their fear:

for fear was round about, saith the Lord; from whence it came; it was he
that put it into them, took away their courage, and made them a
"magormissabib", or "fear round about", the word here used; see [Jer
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#003.md). The Targum is,

"they looked not back to resist them that slay with the sword, who are
gathered against them round about, saith the Lord;''

their enemies surrounded them, and that was the reason fear was round
about them, and both were from the Lord; or as he had said, determined,
and foretold it should be.

[Jeremiah 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 46:6</span></span>

Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty men escape,.... Those that
were swift of foot, like Asahel, or carried but light armour, let not
such trust to their swiftness or light carriage; nor let the mighty man
think to escape by reason of his great strength, to make his way through
the enemy, and get out of his hands. Or this may be rendered as future,
"the swift shall not flee away", &c. (t) so the Targum; neither the one
nor the other shall escape by the nimbleness of their heels, or the
stoutness of their hearts:

they shall stumble and fall toward the north, by the river Euphrates;
which lay north of Judea, where the prophet was, to whom this word came;
and also was to the north of Egypt, whose destruction is here
threatened: the place where this route and slaughter would be made was
Carchemish, which was situated by that river; on the north side of which
city, according to Abarbinel, the battle was; and which sense is
mentioned by Kimchi, which the other follows.

[Jeremiah 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 46:7</span></span>

Who is this that cometh up as a flood,.... These are either the words of
the prophet, who having a vision in prophecy of the march of the
Egyptian army from the south to the north, which he compares to a flood;
in allusion to the river Nile, which used to overflow its banks, and
spread itself over the land; because of the vast numbers of which it
consisted; because of the noise it made, and, because of its rapidity
and force, threatening to bear all down before it; as wondering, asks,
who it was, whose army it was, and to whom it belonged? or they are the
words of God, who puts this question, in order to, give an answer to it,
and thereby upbraid the Egyptians with their arrogance, pride, and
vanity; which would all come to nothing:

whose waters are moved as the rivers? whose numerous armies came with a
great noise and force, like the openings of the Nile, the seven gates of
it; which were very boisterous, especially in hard gales of wind: it is
no unusual thing for large armies to be compared to floods and rivers,
which move forcibly and swiftly, and make a large spread; see [Isa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md). The Targum is,

"who is this that comes up with his army as a cloud, and covers the
earth, and as a fountain of water, whose waters are moved?''

[Jeremiah 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 46:8</span></span>

Egypt riseth up as a flood, and his waters are moved like the
rivers,.... This is the answer to the above question; that it was Egypt
that was seen; the king of Egypt, as the Syriac version; he with his
army, as the Targum; and which was so numerous, that it seemed as if the
whole country of Egypt, all the inhabitants of it, were come along with
him; these rose up like the Nile, and moved like the several sluices of
it, with great velocity and force, as if they would carry all before
them:

and he saith, I will go up; Pharaohnecho king of Egypt said, I will go
up from my own land to the north, to meet the king of Babylon:

and will cover the earth; with his army: even all, the north country,
the whole Babylonish empire; which he affected to be master of, grasping
at, universal monarchy:

I will destroy the city, and the inhabitants thereof; which Abarbinel
restrains to the city Carchemish, where his army was smitten: but it is
better to interpret, the singular by the plural, as the Targum does, "I
will destroy cities"; since it was not a single city he came up to take,
nor would this satisfy his ambitious temper.

[Jeremiah 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 46:9</span></span>

Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots,.... These are either the
words of Pharaoh, giving orders to his cavalry and charioteers to make
haste and come up to battle, not doubting of victory: or rather of the
Lord by the prophet, ironically calling upon the horsemen in the
Egyptian army to come on and engage with the enemy, and behave
gallantly; and those in the chariots to drive, Jehu like, [Kg2
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#020.md), with great swiftness, force, and
fury, to make their chariots rattle again, and run about here and there
like madmen, as the word (u) signifies, to throw the enemy into
confusion and disorder if they could:

and let the mighty men come forth: out of the land of Egypt, as
Abarbinel; or let them come forth, and appear in the field of battle
with courage and greatness of mind, and do all their might and skill can
furnish them with, or enable them to do:

the Ethiopians and the Lybians, that handle the shield; or Cush and
Phut, both sons of Ham, and brethren of Mizraim, from whence Egypt had
its name, [Gen 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006.md); the posterity of
these are meant. The Cushites or Ethiopians were near neighbours of the
Egyptians, and their allies and confederates. The Lybians or Phuteans,
as the Targum, were the posterity of Phut, who dwelt to the westward of
Egypt, and were the auxiliaries of that nation, and with the Ethiopians
and Lydians are mentioned as such in [Eze
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004.md); as here. The shield was a weapon
they much used in war, and were famous for their skill in it, and are
described by it. The Egyptians were remarkable for their shields:
Xenophon (w) describes them as having shields reaching down to their
feet; and which covered their bodies more than the breast plates and
targets of the Persians did; which helped them to push forward, having
them on their shoulders, so that the enemy could not withstand them:

and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow; these were the posterity
of Ludim the son of Mizraim, [Gen
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013.md); and were the Lydians in Africa,
and not in Asia, who sprung from Lud the son of Shem, [Gen
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#022.md); they were famous for their
skilfulness in the use of bows and arrows; see [Isa
66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019.md); now these are called together
to use their military skill, and show all the courage they were masters
of; and yet all would be in vain. Bochart (x) endeavours to prove, by
various arguments, that these Lydians were Ethiopians; and, among the
rest, because they are here, and in [Isa
66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019.md); described as expert in
handling, bending, and drawing the bow; which he proves, by the
testimonies of several writers, the Ethiopians were famous for; that
bows were their armour; and that theirs were larger than others, even
than the Persians, being four cubits long; that they were very dexterous
in shooting their arrows; took sure aim, and seldom missed.

[Jeremiah 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 46:10</span></span>

For this is the day of the Lord God of hosts,.... Or, "but this is the
day" (y), &c. notwithstanding this great apparatus for war, and those
many auxiliaries the Egyptians would have, yet it would not be their
day, in which they should get the better of their enemies; but the
Lord's day; the day he had appointed; who is the Lord God of all armies,
above and below; and who would bring his own armies together when he
pleased, and give them victory:

a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his enemies: the enemies
of his people, as the Targum; the Egyptians, who had been of old the
implacable enemies of his people Israel; though now, contrary to his
will, they too much trusted to them, and relied on them; according to
Kimchi, this vengeance was taken on them for killing Josiah:

and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with
their blood; that is, the sword of the Chaldeans shall destroy the
Egyptians in such vast numbers, that there shall be no more to be slain;
or there shall be no desire in the enemy to slay any more; they shall be
glutted with their blood. All the phrases are designed to show the
carnage that should be made; the vast destruction of the people; the
large numbers that should be slain:

for the Lord God of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the
river Euphrates; near Carchemish, situated by the river Euphrates, which
lay north of Egypt; see [Jer 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#006.md).
Here is an allusion to the sacrifices of great persons, which are many;
the Lord of hosts had a sacrifice, or a great slaughter of men, his
enemies; inflicted punishment on them, wherein his power, justice, and
holiness, were displayed; see [Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 46:11</span></span>

Go up into Gilead,.... Still the irony or sarcasm is continued Gilead
was a place in the land of Israel famous for balm or balsam, used in
curing wounds; see [Jer 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022.md); hence it
follows:

and take balm, O virgin, daughter of Egypt; the kingdom of Egypt, as the
Targum; so called because of its glory and excellency; and because as
yet it had not been conquered and brought under the power of another:
now the inhabitants of it are bid to take balm or balsam, as Kimchi and
Ben Melech; but this grew not in Gilead beyond Jordan, but near Jericho
on this side Jordan, as Bochart (z) has proved from various authors;
particularly Strabo (a) says of Jericho, that there is the paradise of
balsam, an aromatic plant, and of great esteem; for there only it is
produced: and so Diodorus Siculus (b), speaking of places near Jericho,
says, about these places, in a certain valley, grows what is called
balsam, from which much profit arises; nor is the plant to be found in
any other part of the world: and Justin (c) observes the same; that much
riches accrue to the nation from the tax on balsam, which is only
produced in this country, in Jericho, and the valley near it; yea,
Kimchi himself elsewhere (d) says, that the balsam is not any where in
the whole world but in Jericho. The word therefore should be rendered
rosin, as also in [Jer 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022.md); as it is
by some (e); and which is used in cleansing, healing, and contracting
wounds, and dispersing humours, as Pliny (f) relates; and this here is
ordered to be taken, either literally, to cure the vast number of their
wounded by the Chaldeans; or rather, figuratively, they are called upon
to make use of all means to recover their loss sustained; by recruiting
their army, fortifying their cities, and getting fresh allies and
auxiliaries; all which would yet be to no purpose:

in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shall not be cured;
notwithstanding all means made use of to repair its losses; though it
should not utterly be destroyed yet should never recover its former
glory.

The nations have heard of thy shame,.... Their shameful defeat and
overthrow by the Chaldean army; so, after the manner of prophecy, the
thing is related as done; the battle fought, and the victory obtained;
and the rumour and fame of it spread among the nations, to the great
mortification of this proud people:

and thy cry hath filled the land; the shrieks of the wounded; the cry of
the pursued and taken; the lamentation of friends and relations for
their dead; with one thing or another of this kind the whole land of
Egypt was filled; yea, all the countries round about them, in
confederacy with them, were filled with distress for the loss of their
own; the calamity was large and spreading, and the rumour of it:

for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen
both together; either the mighty Egyptians against the mighty Chaldeans;
and though the latter were the conquerors, yet lost abundance of men; so
that there were mighty ones fell on both sides: or rather, as Jarchi,
Kimchi, and Abarbinel, the mighty Egyptians in their flight fell, and
other mighty ones of them following, stumbled at them, and fell upon
them, and so both became a prey to the pursuers; or in their flight the
mighty Egyptians stumbled against their mighty auxiliaries before
mentioned, [Jer 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md); and so both came
into the hands of their enemies. The Targum is, both were slain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 46:13</span></span>

The word that the Lord spake to Jeremiah the prophet,.... This is a new
and distinct prophecy from the former, though concerning Egypt as that;
but in this they differ; the former prophecy respects only the overthrow
of the Egyptian army at a certain place; this latter the general
destruction of the land; and was fulfilled some years after the other;
Jarchi says, according to their chronicles (g), in the twenty seventh
year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign:

how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come; or, "concerning the
coming (h) of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon",

to smite the land of Egypt; who was to come, and did come, out of his
country, into the land of Egypt, to smite the inhabitants of it with the
sword, take their cities, plunder them of their substance, and make them
tributary to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 46:14</span></span>

Declare ye in Egypt,.... The coming of the king of Babylon, and his
intention to invade the land, and subdue it:

and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph, and in Tahpanhes; of these
places See Gill on [Jer 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md); these
were principal ones in the land of Egypt, where the enemy should come,
and which he should lay waste; and therefore the above things are to be
published for their warning; and particularly these were places where
the Jews that went into Egypt contrary to the will of God resided; and
therefore for their sakes also this publication must be made, to let
them see and know that they would not be safe there, but would be
involved in the general calamity of the nation:

say ye, stand fast, and prepare thee; O Egypt, and the several cities
mentioned, and all others; prepare for war, and to meet the enemy,
resist and repel him; present yourselves on the frontiers of your
country; put yourselves in proper places, and keep your ground:

for the sword shall devour round about thee; the sword of the Chaldeans,
into whose hands fell Palestine, Judea, Syria, and other neighbouring
countries; and therefore it was high time for them to bestir themselves,
and provide for their defence and safety.

[Jeremiah 46:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 46:15</span></span>

Why are thy valiant men swept away?.... As with a mighty torrent, or a
sweeping rain; so the word is used in [Pro
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#003.md); to which the Chaldean army may
be compared; which came with such irresistible force as to drive the
Egyptians from their posts, so that they could not stand their ground.
The Septuagint renders it,

"why does Apis flee from thee? thy choice ox does not continue.''

Which was the god of the Egyptians, they worshipped in the form of an
ox; this could not protect them, though thought by them to be very
mighty and powerful; so Aelianus (i) says Apis with the Egyptians is
believed to be a most powerful deity; yet could not save them; but the
word signifies their nobles, their mighty men of war, their generals and
officers, at least their valiant soldiers; who yet were not able to
stand the tide of power that came against them. The reason was,

because the Lord did drive them; by means of the Chaldeans; he
dispirited them; he put them into a panic, and they fled from their
posts; there is no standing against the Lord.

He made many to fall,.... That is, the Lord, by the hand of the
Chaldeans, by whose sword multitudes fell in battle:

yea, one fell upon another; they fell in heaps, denoting the multitude
of the slain; or rather they fell in flight one upon another; one fell,
and then another upon him, as usually they do, when men are frightened
and flee precipitantly, as in [Jer
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#012.md);

and they said, arise: not those that fell, which may seem at first
sight; but either the strangers in the land of Egypt, as Kimchi, such as
the Jews were; who, perceiving the destruction that was coming on Egypt,
exhort one another to arise, and get out of it; or rather the
auxiliaries of the Egyptians, as the Ethiopians, Lybians, and Lydians,
[Jer 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md); who finding the enemy too
strong for them, and they themselves deserted or unsupported by
Pharaoh's army, advise one another to quit his service, and provide for
their own safety:

and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity;
their own country, where they were born, and their friends and relations
lived; that so they might be safe

from the oppressing sword; the sword of the Chaldeans. The Septuagint
version is a very bad one, followed by the Arabic, which renders it,
"from the Grecian sword"; and so is the Vulgate Latin version, "from the
face of the dove"; to countenance which it is said, that the Chaldeans
and Assyrians had a dove in their ensigns; See Gill on [Jer
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038.md); and so a most ancient Saxon
translation in the library of Christ's Church in Oxford, "from the face
of the sword of the culver" (k), or "dove"; that is, from their sword,
who display their banners in the field with the ensign of a dove;
meaning the Chaldeans. The Targum is,

"from the sword of the enemy, which is as wine inebriating;''

which sense is followed by Jarchi.

They did cry there,.... Not the Chaldeans, deriding Pharaoh and his
army, and mocking them, saying the following words, as some; nor the
Egyptians in Egypt, as Kimchi, complaining of their king; much less in
Carchemish, as others; since this prophecy refers to another event,
time, and place; but the auxiliaries of Egypt in the field of battle;
these did cry out aloud, as follows:

Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he boasted and bragged of great
things he would do, and does nothing; he promised to bring a large army
into the field, and talked big of attacking the enemy with great ardour
and fury, and hectored and blustered as if he feared him not, and was
sure of victory; but when it came to the push, his courage failed him;
and it may be said of him what the man said of his nightingale, "vox et
praeterea nihil", a voice, and nothing else. This was not Pharaohnecho,
as the Septuagint have wrongly inserted, but Pharaohhophra, [Jer
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md); or it may be supplied thus,
"Pharaoh king of Egypt is a king of noise" (l); a noisy, big, and
blusterous king in words, but in deeds nothing:

he hath passed the time appointed; to join his auxiliaries, in order to
give the enemy battle; and so left them in the lurch, of which they
complain; or through his dilatoriness lost the proper opportunity of
attacking him. Some indeed understand it, not of the king of Egypt, but
of the king of Babylon; as if the sense was this, the Egyptians cried
aloud, and encouraged themselves and their allies against the king of
Babylon; saying, what Jeremiah the prophet said concerning Pharaoh king
of Egypt and his destruction is all mere noise; there is nothing in it;
for the time set by him for that event is passed and over: others,
because the word has sometimes the signification of a solemn meeting or
festival, take the meaning to be, that Pharaoh king of Egypt being
brought to utter destruction, as the word for noise may signify, or
being a noisy tumultuous prince, who brought ruin on himself and others,
has thereby caused the solemn feasts to pass away (m), or the festivals
to cease; whether in a civil or a religious way; but the first sense
seems best.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 46:18</span></span>

As I live, saith the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts,.... A
greater King than either Nebuchadnezzar or Pharaoh; the Lord of the
armies of heaven and earth; and who has them all at his command and
service; swears by his life, by himself, because he can swear by no
greater, to the truth of what follows; for this is the form of an oath:

surely, as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea,

so shall he come. Tabor is commonly said to be the mountain on which our
Lord was transfigured; but that there is any just foundation for it is
not certain. It was a mountain in Galilee, situated on the borders of
the tribes of Issachar and Zebulun, [Jos
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012.md); it was two leagues from
Nazareth eastward (n); three miles from the lake of Gennesaret; ten
miles from Diocaesarea to the east; and two days' journey from Jerusalem
(o). Adrichomius (p) says it was a most beautiful mountain, situated in
the midst of the plain of Galilee, remarkable for its roundness, and was
about four miles or thirty furlongs high, abounding with vines, olives,
and fruit trees, with which it was set all over; and gave to those at
sea a most delightful sight at a considerable distance. Our countryman,
Mr. Maundrell (q), who travelled up it, gives this account of it; that
it

"stands by itself in the plain of Esdraelon (the same the Scripture
calls the valley of Jezreel); after a very laborious ascent (says he),
which took up near an hour, we reached the highest part of the mountain:
it has a plain area at top, most fertile and delicious; of an oval
figure, extended about one furlong in breadth, and two in length: this
area is enclosed with trees on all parts, except towards the south.''

It is called by the Septuagint, Josephus, and other writers, Itabyrium.
Carmel is with great propriety called "Carmel by the sea"; it was
situated on the border of the tribe of Asher; and near to it was the
river Kishon, [Jos 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#026.md). So Mr.
Maundrell (r) says,

"we arrived in two hours at that ancient river, the river Kishon, which
cuts his way down the middle of the plain of Esdraelon; and then,
continuing his course close by the side of Mount Carmel, falls into the
sea at a place called Caypha;''

by which it appears that the mount was near the sea; and Pliny (s) calls
it a promontory, and places it on the Phoenician shore; on which he says
were the promontory Carmel, and a town upon the mountain of the same
name, formerly called Ecbatana. Adrichomius (t) gives it the name of
"Carmel of the sea"; and says it was a very high mountain, and woody,
abounding with most noble vines, olives, fruit trees, and odoriferous
herbs. So Josephus (u) makes mention of Carmel and the sea together; he
says, the Zebulonites obtained land as far as the lake of Genezareth,
contiguous to Carmel and the sea; and their being near to each other
appears from a passage in the Jerusalem Talmud (w); says

"R. Samuel Bar Chain Bar Judah, in the name of R. Chanina, when the orb
of the sun begins to set, a man standing on Mount Carmel, and goes down
and dips in the great sea (the Mediterranean sea), and goes up again,
and eats his "teruma" (or offering), it is a presumption that he dipped
in the daytime;''

and which is also evident from the passage in [Kg1
18:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#042.md); where Elijah and his servant
are said to be on the top of Mount Carmel, and from thence he bid his
servant look towards the sea: now these mountains so situated are taken
notice of, either to show the manner of the king of Babylon's coming
against Egypt; that as Tabor and Carmel were high mountains in the land
of Israel, so should Nebuchadnezzar lift up his head on high, and come
with great pride and haughtiness of spirit against the Egyptians; or
rather the certainty of his coming, that he should come as sure as those
mountains were in the places they were; or, best of all, the certainty
of the destruction of the Egyptians, and the truth of this prophecy
concerning it; though the Egyptians were as firm, and might think
themselves as secure and as immovable, as the above mountains, yet
should certainly come to ruin, and the word of God concerning it should
stand as firm as they. To this sense agrees the Targum,

"as this word stands firm, that Tabor is among the mountains, and Carmel
in the sea, so shall his destruction come.''

The words, according to the accents, may be better rendered, "as Tabor
among the mountains, and Carmel also, he shall come into the sea" (x);
that is, Pharaoh, though he lift up his head as high as Tabor and
Carmel, he shall be brought low into the depths of the sea; into a most
forlorn and deplorable condition, into a very low estate; and perhaps
there may be an allusion to the ancient Pharaoh being drowned in the
sea; and with this agrees the Syriac version, "Pharaoh shall fall as the
fragment of a mountain, and as Carmel, into the midst of the sea";
compare with this [Mat 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023.md).

plenty, and who promised themselves a long continuance:

furnish thyself to go into captivity; or, "make", or "prepare for
thyself vessels of captivity" (y); or such things as are proper for
captives, as suitable clothes to travel in, shoes to walk in, scrip and
staff, and the like; expect captivity, and prepare for it:

for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant; the city
Memphis, as the Targum, and all the versions: this is particularly
mentioned, because it was a royal city, as Kimchi observes; and, though
a very populous one, its destruction should be so general, that not an
inhabitant should be left in it: the devastation of this city is put for
that of all the rest, and as a sure token of it and the whole nation
going into captivity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 46:20</span></span>

Egypt is like a very fair heifer,.... Like a heifer that has never been
under a yoke, it having never been conquered, and brought under the
power of another; and like a beautiful, fat, and well fed one, abounding
in wealth and riches, in pleasures and delights, in wantonness and
luxury, and fit for slaughter, and ready for it. The Targum is,

"Egypt was a beautiful kingdom.''

Some think there is an illusion to the gods of Egypt, Apis and Mnevis,
which were heifers or oxen, very beautiful, that had fine spots and
marks upon them. Apis was worshipped at Memphis, or Noph, before
mentioned, as to be wasted; and Mnevis at Heliopolis, the city of the
sun, the same with Bethshemesh, whose destruction is prophesied of; See
Gill on [Jer 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013.md); and both these
were of various colours, as Ovid (z) says, particularly of one of them,
and is true of both. Pomponius Mela (a) observes of Apis, the god of all
the people of Egypt, that it was a black ox, remarkable for certain
spots; and unlike to others in its tongue and tail. And Solinus (b)
says, it is famous for a white spot on its right side, in the form of a
new moon: with whom Pliny (c) agrees, that it has a white spot on the
right side, like the horns of the moon, when it begins to increase; and
that it has a knot under the tongue, which they call a beetle. And so
Herodotus (d) says, it is very black, and has a white square spot on the
forehead; on the back, the effigies of an eagle; two hairs in the tail,
and a beetle On the tongue, To which may be added what Strabo (e)
reports, that at Memphis, the royal city of Egypt, is the temple of
Apis, the same with Osiris; where the ox of Apis is fed in an enclosure,
and reckoned to be a god; it is white in its forehead, and in some small
parts of the body, and the rest black; by which marks and signs it is
always judged what is proper to be put in its place when dead. In the
Table of Iris (f), published by Pignorius, it is otherwise painted and
described; its head, neck, horns, buttocks, and tail, black, and the
rest white; and, on the right side, a corniculated streak. Aelianus (g)
says, these marks were in number twenty nine, and, according to the
Egyptians, were symbols of things; some, of the nature of the stars;
some, of the overflowing of the Nile; some, of the darkness of the world
before the light, and of other things: and all agree, that the ox looked
fair and beautiful, to which the allusion is; and there may be in the
words an ironical sarcasm, flout, and jeer, at the gods they worshipped,
which could not save them from the destruction coming upon them, as
follows:

but destruction cometh, it cometh from the north; that is, the
destruction of Egypt, which should come from Chaldea, which lay north of
Egypt; and the coming of it is repeated, to denote the quickness and
certainty of it: the word used signifies a cutting off, or a cutting up;
in allusion to the cutting off the necks of heifers, which used to be
done when slain, [Deu 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#004.md); or to the
cutting of them up, as is done by butchers: and the abstract being put
for the concrete, it may be rendered, the "cutter up" (h); or cutter
off; men, like butchers, shall come out of Babylon, and slay and cut up,
this heifer. So the Targum,

"people, that are slayers shall come out of the north against her, to
spoil her (i);''

that is, the Chaldean army, agreeably to the Syriac version,

"an army shall come out of the north against her.''

All her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks,.... Or,
"bullocks of the stall" (k); soldiers of other countries, that were
hired into the service of Egypt, and lived so deliciously there, that
they were unfit for war, and were like fatted beasts prepared for the
slaughter. The Targum and Jarchi interpret it, her princes (l); who had
the care of this heifer, and of the feeding of it; these themselves were
like that, nourished for the day of slaughter:

for they also are turned back, and are fled away together; they turned
their backs upon the enemy in battle, and fled in great confusion and
precipitancy; see [Jer 46:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#015.md);

they did not stand; and face the enemy, and light him, but fell or fled
before him:

because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of
their visitation; the time appointed by the Lord to visit and punish
them, and bring destruction on them for their sins.

The voice thereof shall go like a serpent,.... That is, the voice of
Egypt, before compared to a heifer, when in its glory; but now it shall
not bellow like a heifer in fat pasture, bat hiss like a serpent, when
drove out of its hole, and pursued; signifying, that their voice should
be low and submissive, and should not speak one big or murmuring word to
their conquerors. The voice of the serpent is, by Aristotle (m) said to
be small and weak; so Aelianus (n). Though Jarchi, Kimchi, and
Abarbinel, understand it of the voice of serpents heard afar off; and so
it may respect the dreadful lamentation the Egyptians should make, when
they should see the Chaldeans come upon them to destroy them; just as
serpents in woods make a horrible noise, when they are set on fire, or
are cut down, to which there is an allusion in some following clauses.
The Targum seems to interpret this of the Chaldean army thus,

"the voice of the clashing of their arms as serpents creeping;''

and of them the following words are certainly meant:

for they shall march with an army; the Targum adds, against you; the
meaning is, that the Chaldeans should come with a great army, and march
against the Egyptians with great strength, force, and fury:

and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood; with battle axes, as
if they came to cut down trees; nor would they spare the Egyptians any
more than such hewers do the trees; nor would they be able any more to
resist them than trees can resist hewers of wood.

They shall cut down her forest, saith the Lord,.... The land of Egypt,
compared to a forest, for the multitude of its cities and towns, and the
inhabitants of them; which should be destroyed by the Chaldeans, as a
forest is cut down by hewers of wood; the metaphor is here continued.
The Targum interprets this of the princes of Egypt, and the destruction
of them;

though it cannot be searched; either the forest of Egypt, which was so
thick of trees; that is, the land was so full of towns and cities, that
they could not be searched and numbered; and though the way through it
seemed impassable, yet was made passable by the hewers of wood: or its
destruction would be so general, "that it cannot be searched" (o); or
found out, where this forest was, where those trees grew, not one of
them standing: or else this is to be understood of the Chaldean army,
which was so great, that it could not be numbered:

because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable; which
creatures come in large numbers, and eat up every green tree and herb;
and so the Chaldean army, being alike numerous, would easily cut down
the trees of this forest, though they were so many.

The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saith,.... These titles are often
given to the Lord, and set before prophecies that come from him; and,
according to Kimchi, the reason why he is here spoken of as the God of
Israel was, because the vengeance threatened to the Egyptians should
come upon them, as a punishment for using Israel ill; as Shishak king of
Egypt, and Pharaohnecho, who slew Josiah:

behold, I will punish the multitude of No; the inhabitants of it, which
were many, called "populous No", [Nah
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md); a famous city in Egypt. Some take
it to be Diospolis or Thebes; and others (p) the same that is now called
Alexandria; and so the Targum renders it; and which is followed by the
Vulgate Latin version: and Jarchi calls it the seignory or government of
Alexandria; and takes Amon, the word for "multitude", to signify the
prince of this place; and so Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it, king of
a city called No: rather Jupiter Ammon (q) is meant, an idol of the
Egyptians, which had a temple in Thebes, and was worshipped in it; and
who had his name from Ham, the son of Noah. Hillerus (r), by various
arguments, endeavours to prove that No is the same city with Memphis,
and that No Amon signifies "the habitation of the nourished"; that is,
of Apis, which was nourished here. But be he who he will, or the place
what it will, he or that would certainly be punished;

and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; Pharaoh, the
present king of Egypt, who was Pharaohhophra, and all the land of Egypt;
and all their numerous idols, which were many indeed; and the several
governors of the nomes or provinces into which the land was distributed;
these should be punished, and suffer in the general calamity;

even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him; the Jews that dwelt in
Egypt, and who thought themselves safe under his protection; such who
went along with Johanan thither, contrary to the will of God; these
should not escape punishment, but be involved in the same destruction.

that any were carried captive along with him, [Kg2

righteous in Egypt, who were carried thither by Johanan against their
will; but though they may be included, even that small remnant that
should escape, [Jer 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028.md); yet the
Jews in Babylon, and other provinces, are chiefly designed; and the
words are intended to comfort them in their captivity, with a promise of
their return, lest they should be discouraged, in hearing that the
Egyptians should inhabit their own land again, and they not theirs:

and Jacob shall return, and be in rest, and at ease, and none shall make
him afraid: this will have its full accomplishment hereafter in the
latter day; when the Jews will be converted, and return to their own
land, and never be disturbed more, as they have been, ever since their
return from the Babylonish captivity. So Kimchi says this passage

for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven
thee; the Babylonians and Chaldeans are no more:

but I will not make a full end of thee; the Jews to this day remain a
