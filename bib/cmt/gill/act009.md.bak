### [Acts Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md)

[Acts 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 9:1</span></span>

And Saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter,.... The historian
having given an account of the dispersion of all the preachers of the
Gospel at Jerusalem, excepting the apostles, and of their success in
other parts, especially of Philip's, returns to the history of Saul;
who, not satisfied with the murder of Stephen, and with the havoc he
made of the church at Jerusalem, haling them out of their houses to
prison, continued not only to threaten them with confiscation of goods
and imprisonment, but with death itself. The phrase here used is an
Hebraism; so in [Psa 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md) , "one that
breathes out violence", or cruelty; and this shows the inward
disposition of his mind, the rage, wrath, malice, envy, and blood
thirstiness he was full of; and is observed to illustrate the riches of
divine grace in his conversion. And wonderful it is, that that same
mouth which breathed out destruction and death to the followers of
Christ, should afterwards publish and proclaim the Gospel of the grace
of God; that he whose mouth was full of cursing and bitterness, should
hereafter, and so very quickly, come forth in the fulness of the
blessing of the Gospel of Christ. And this rage of his, who now ravened
as a wolf, as was foretold of Benjamin, of which tribe he was, was
against the lambs of Christ, and the sheep of his fold:

against the disciples of the Lord; not against wicked men, murderers,
and thieves, and other evildoers, but against the harmless and innocent
followers of Jesus, and which was an aggravation of his cruelty: and
being thus heated, and full of wrath,

he went unto the high priest; Annas or Caiaphas, who, notwithstanding
the Jews were under the Roman government, had great authority to punish
persons with stripes and death itself, who acted contrary to their law.

[Acts 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 9:2</span></span>

And desired of him letters to Damascus,.... Damascus was the head or
metropolis of Syria, [Isa 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md) And so
Pliny (z) calls it Damascus of Syria: it was a very ancient city; it was
in the times of Abraham; his servant Eliezer is said to be of it, [Gen
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md) and some say it was built by him
the said Eliezer; though Josephus (a) makes Uz, a grandson of Shem, to
be the founder of it; whose surname is conjectured, by some, to be
Dimshak, seeing that and Uz differ not in sense: and Justin says (b), it
had its name from Damascus, the king of it, in honour of whom the
Syrians made a temple of the sepulchre of his wife Arathis, and her a
goddess; after Damascus, he says, Azelus, then Azores, Abraham, and
Israel were kings of it. Some think it has its name from blood, and that
it signifies a "sack" or bag, or, as Jerom explains, a cup of blood (c),
or one that drinks blood; who says, it is a true tradition, that the
field in which Abel was killed by Cain, was in Damascus (d): but it
seems rather to be so called from the redness of the earth about it; for
some very good writers affirm, that the earth in the fields of Damascus
is like wax tinged with red lead; so if it be read Dammesek, as it
commonly is, in the Arabic language, "Damma" signifies to tinge, and
"Meshko" is used for "red earth"; or if "Dummesek", as it is in [Kg2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md), "Daumo", in the same language,
is "permanent", what always abides, and "Meshko", as before, "red
earth", and so "Dummesek" is never failing red earth; or if it be
Darmesek", as in [Ch1 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#005.md) the same
with Darmsuk", it may be observed, that the Syrians call red earth "Doro
sumoko": so that, upon the whole, this seems to be the best etymology of
the word (e), and the rise of the name of this famous city, which Justin
calls the most noble city of Syria. It is said (f) to be an hundred and
sixty miles from Jerusalem. Here might be many Christians before, and
others might flee hither upon this persecution; and Saul, not content
with driving them from their native place, persecuted them, as he
himself says, to strange cities: and that he might do this with safety
to himself, and with the greater force and cruelty to them, he got
letters from the high priest, and sanhedrim, at Jerusalem; either
recommending him to the Jews at Damascus, and exhorting them to assist
him in what he came about; or empowering him to act under his authority,
or both: and these were directed to be delivered

to the synagogues; to the rulers of them; for the Jews being numerous in
this place, they had more synagogues than one. Josephus says (g), that
under Nero the inhabitants of Damascus killed ten thousand Jews in their
own city: and Benjamin Tudelensis (h) in his time says, there were about
three thousand Jews (Pharisees), besides two hundred Karaites (or
Scripturarians), and four hundred Samaritans, who lived in peace
together. Now to these synagogues, and the chief men of them, was Saul
recommended for assistance and direction,

that if he found any of this way; of thinking; that were of this sect of
religion, and either professed to believe, or preach, that Jesus of
Nazareth was the Messiah:

whether they were men or women; without any fear of one, or mercy to the
other:

he might bring them bound to Jerusalem; to be examined and punished by
the sanhedrim there, as they should think fit; and for this purpose he
must take with him a considerable number of men; and that he had men
with him is certain from [Act 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007.md).

[Acts 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 9:3</span></span>

And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus,.... Some say it was a mile
from Damascus: though, no mention is made of his obtaining letters from
the high priest, only of his desiring them; yet there is no doubt but
they were granted him; the design of the historian, under a divine
direction, being to give an account of the temper and disposition of
Saul; and he having got them, set out on his journey in high spirits,
and proceeded on with the same wicked intentions, till he came near the
city; where he designed to open and show his commission, and execute his
wrathful purposes; but he is not suffered to go into the city with such
a Spirit:

and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven; which
exceeded the light and brightness of the sun, for it was at midday, [Act
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#013.md) and so the Ethiopic version here
inserts this clause, "and it was noon time"; which circumstance shows
that the light was very extraordinary; and it was an emblem of that
inward and spiritual light which was now quickly communicated to him,
light being the first thing in the new, as in the old creation; and of
that Gospel light he was hereafter to spread in the world.

[Acts 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 9:4</span></span>

And he fell to the earth,.... Not being able to bear the light, and
still less the divine glory and majesty which he perceived was present;
and therefore, in great confusion, amazement, and fear, he fell with his
face to the ground, and lay there prostrate and so did also those that
were with him, [Act 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014.md)

and heard a voice, saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
this voice was the real voice of Christ in his human nature, and who
visibly and in person appeared, and was seen by the apostle; [Act
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016.md) the language he spoke in was the
Hebrew tongue, and he calls him by his Hebrew name Saul, and which is
doubled to denote vehemency and affection; See Gill on [Luk
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031.md) he knew him as one of his sheep,
though straying, and calls him by name, and expostulates with him,
wherefore he should persecute him in his members as he did; for the
union between Christ and his people is so close, that what is done to
them is done to him. There seems to be a considerable emphasis on the
word "me"; "me", who have been they surety from everlasting; "me", who
hath loved thee and given myself for thee; "me", who have shed my blood,
laid down my life, and died for thee; "me", who am now at my Father's
right hand, interceding for thee, that grace might be bestowed upon
thee, the set time being now come.

[Acts 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 9:5</span></span>

And he said, who art thou, Lord?.... For he knew not whether it was God,
or an angel, or who it was that spake to him; he knew not Christ by his
form or voice, as Stephen did, when he saw him standing at the right
hand of God; he was in a state of ignorance, and knew neither the
person, nor voice of Christ, and yet his heart was so far softened and
wrought upon, that he was desirous of knowing who he was;

and the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest. The Alexandrian
copy, and the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, "read Jesus of Nazareth";
and one of Beza's copies, and another of Stephens', as in [Act
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#008.md) whose name thou art doing many
things against, and whose people thou art destroying:

it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks; or "to resist me", as
the Arabic version renders it; and which is the sense of the phrase; it
is a proverbial expression, taken from beasts that are goaded, who kick
against the goads or pricks, and hurt themselves the more thereby; and
Christ uses it, suggesting hereby, that should Saul go on to persecute
him and his people, to oppose his Gospel, and the strong evidence of it,
in doctrine and miracles, and notwithstanding the present remonstrances
made in such an extraordinary manner; he would find himself in the issue
greatly hurt by it, and could not rationally expect to succeed against
so powerful a person. This clause in the Syriac version is placed at the
end of the fourth verse.

[Acts 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 9:6</span></span>

And he trembling and astonished,.... At the light and voice, and
appearance of Christ, and especially at the words last spoken; he was
now pricked to the heart, and filled with a sense of sin, and loaded
with guilt, and had dreadful apprehensions of his state and condition,
on account of his past wickedness, and the present course of sin he was
in: so persons under first convictions "tremble" at the sight of their
sins, which rise up like so many ghosts, and stare them in the face, and
load their consciences with guilt; at the swarms of corruptions they see
in their carts, which appear to them an habitation of devils, a hold of
every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird; at the
curses of a righteous law which threatens with damnation and death; at
the future judgment, and the apprehensions of divine wrath; and at the
voice and word of God, which strikes terror, cuts them to the heart, and
like an hammer breaks the rock in pieces: and they are "astonished" at
their own wickedness and vileness, which they had no conception of
before; at the sparing mercy and forbearance of God, who has continued
them in being, and not sent them to hell, to be among devils and damned
spirits; at the light around by which they see their sins, the plague of
their own hearts, the insufficiency of their own righteousness, their
lost state by nature, and need of salvation by Christ; and at the
doctrines of the Gospel, so far as they have light into them; and at the
person of Christ, and at his Father's love and his in procuring
salvation for them:

said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? he was willing to do any thing
he should him to, whereby he might make satisfaction for the injury he
had done him, and by which he might be saved; for he was still upon the
covenant of works, as persons under first convictions commonly are:

and the Lord said unto him; this, with all that goes before in this
verse, is wanting in the Alexandrian copy, and Syriac version: "arise
and go into the city"; that is, of Damascus, as the Ethiopic version
reads:

and it shall be told thee what thou must do; what was appointed for him
to do, [Act 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#010.md) and there it was
told him both what he should do and suffer for Christ, but not to obtain
salvation; and this was done internally by the Spirit of God, who
instructed him in the doctrines and ordinances of the Gospel, and
externally by Ananias: in two of Beza's copies, and in the Syriac
version, it is read, "there shall it be told thee", &c.

[Acts 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 9:7</span></span>

And the men which journeyed with him,.... Out of respect to him, to keep
him company; or rather to assist him in his designs:

stood speechless: astonished and amazed, they had not power to speak one
word, nor to rise from the ground, and move one step forward; they were
as if they were thunderstruck, and fastened to the earth; for this
standing is not opposed to their being fallen to the earth, but to their
going forward, and only expresses the surprise and stupidity that had
seized them:

hearing a voice, but seeing no man; that is, they heard the voice of
Saul, saying, who art thou? and what wilt thou have me to do? but saw
nobody that he spoke to, which surprised them; for it is certain they
did not hear the voice of Christ, that spake to him, [Act
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#009.md) or if they heard the voice of
Christ, it was only the sound of his voice, but did not understand what
he said; but the former seems rather to be the sense, and the best way
of reconciling the two passages.

[Acts 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 9:8</span></span>

And Saul arose from the earth,.... As he was bid by Christ, [Act
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006.md)

and when his eyes were opened he saw no man; neither Christ, who
appeared to him from heaven, whom he had before seen, nor even any of
his companions, nor indeed any object: the Syriac version renders it,
"he saw nothing"; not anything at all; and the Ethiopic version, "he
could not see": when he opened his eye lids, he perceived his sight was
gone, and this showed it to be real blindness; and which was an emblem
of the ignorance and blindness he had been in:

but they led him by the hand; the men that were with him, perceiving
that he could not guide himself, took him by the hand, and led him on
his journey;

and brought him into Damascus; and now was fulfilled, at least in part,
the prophecy in [Zac 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md).

[Acts 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 9:9</span></span>

And he was three days without sight,.... Without bodily sight; for
otherwise all this while his spiritual sight was increasing, and Christ
was giving him by his Spirit a full view of himself, his state and case,
and where his salvation was; and a clear insight into the doctrines of
the Gospel, which he is said to have by the revelation of Christ,
whereby he was fitted for the immediate preaching of it:

and neither did eat nor drink; having no regard unto, or time for
either; being filled with grief and sorrow, and true repentance for sin,
and taken up in prayer to God, and employed in attending to, and
receiving the doctrines of grace, he was afterwards to publish.

[Acts 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 9:10</span></span>

And there was a certain disciple at Damascus,.... Who perhaps came
hither upon the persecution at Jerusalem, or rather might have lived
here some time; [Act 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#013.md) that he was
more than a private or ordinary disciple of Christ seems manifest, from
his being sent to Saul on such an, important affair; from his putting
his hands upon him, upon which he was filled with the Holy Ghost; and
from his baptizing him: some think he was one of the seventy disciples;
some say he was a deacon; but it is certain he was not one of the first
seven; others affirm he was a presbyter, and some report that he was
afterwards bishop of Damascus, and died a martyr there; but these are
things not to be depended on:

named Ananias; a Jewish name, the same with Hananiah, [Dan
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#006.md) there was an high priest of this
name, [Act 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002.md) and it was a name in
much use among the Jews; frequent mention is made in the Misnic and
Talmudic writings of R. Hananiah, or Ananias:

and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias; by "the Lord", is meant
the Lord Jesus Christ, as is evident from [Act
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017.md) who appeared to Ananias in a
vision; the Arabic version adds, "by night"; perhaps in a dream, as the
angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph the husband of Mary, and called him
by his name Ananias, to which he answered:

and he said, behold, I am here, Lord; in like manner as Samuel did, when
a child, when the Lord called to him; showing his readiness to hearken
to his voice, to do his will, and obey his orders, be they what they
would.

[Acts 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 9:11</span></span>

And the Lord said unto him, arise,.... Quickly, directly, immediately,
from off thy bed; the case required haste and dispatch:

and go into the street which is called Straight; a street in the city of
Damascus so called; the streets of cities were called by different
names, to distinguish them as ours now are. So in Jerusalem there was
the street of the house of God, which led to the temple, [Ezr
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#009.md) and the upper street, in which
idolatrous Gentiles, and such as were fullers by trade, dwelt (i); and
the street of the butchers; and the street of the wool staplers (k): and
this street in Damascus might be called "Straight"; because it might be
a long straight street, without any windings and turnings, which might
go through the city. Whether or no this was one of the streets which
Benhadad allowed Ahab to make in Damascus, [Kg1
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034.md) cannot be said;

and inquire in the house of Judas; which was in that street: who this
Judas was is not certain, that he was a Jew appears by his name, but
whether a believing, or an unbelieving Jew, is not known; however, he
was Saul's host, and if this was the house he was recommended to from
Jerusalem, or designed to go to when he set out from thence, it is very
probable he was an unbeliever; but if it was an house he pitched on
after his conversion, it is likely this Judas was a believer, and
whether the same with Judas surnamed Barsabas may be considered, who is
mentioned in [Act 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md) however, at
this man's house Ananias was to inquire

for one called Saul of Tarsus; or Saul "by name the Tarsian". So it is
said (l) of Bigthan and Teresh, [Est
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#002.md) that they were , "two Tarsians",
perhaps citizens of Tarsus, as Saul was. Tarsus was a city in Cilicia,
and which Solinus (m) calls the mother of cities, and is the same with
the Tarshish of the Old Testament; here Saul was born, and of it he was
a citizen; [Act 21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039.md) and therefore is
here called Saul of Tarsus, or Saul the Tarsian:

for behold he prayeth: so as he had never prayed before; now he prayed
with the Spirit, and with the understanding, from a feeling sense of his
wants, for spiritual blessings, such as he had no knowledge of, nor
desire after before. God has no stillborn children; as soon as any are
quickened by his grace, they cry unto him; prayer is the breath of a
regenerate man, and shows him to be alive. He who before was breathing
out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of Christ, now
breathes after communion with Christ and them. This is said, no doubt,
to encourage Ananias to go to him. The Syriac and Arabic versions place
this clause at the beginning of the next verse, "for behold, whilst he
prayed he saw", &c. the Ethiopic version has it not.

[Acts 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 9:12</span></span>

And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias,.... Some read this verse
in a parenthesis, and take them to be the words of Luke the historian;
but it is rather a continuation of the words of Christ, telling Ananias,
for his greater encouragement to go to Saul, that he had seen him in a
vision, and had knowledge both of his person, and of his name, and of
what he was to do to him; for in the vision or dream, he had been
represented to him as

coming in; to the house, and into the room where he was:

and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight; without
which he had been three days, and which he did receive upon Ananias's
putting his hands on him.

[Acts 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 9:13</span></span>

Then Ananias answered, Lord,.... Though Ananias knew that it was the
Lord that spoke, and acknowledged his power and dominion, and expressed
his readiness to obey his commands; yet there was a timidity in him, and
which was the more inexcusable, that it should appear after the Lord had
told him of the vision which Saul had had of him; and yet still he was
fearful of putting himself into his hands, who had been so violent a
persecutor; and therefore obliquely excuses himself, by observing what
Saul had done at Jerusalem, and the powers he came with to Damascus:

I have heard by many of this man; which shows that Ananias had been at
Damascus some time, and was not an eyewitness of the havoc Saul made of
the church, only had the account of it from others; and these many who
fled to Damascus upon the persecution, which Saul was at the head of;
and being so, was particularly spoken of, and his name was well known,
and was become infamous for his cruelty and barbarity;

how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem; by entering into
their houses with violence, haling men and women from thence, committing
them to prison, and persecuting them unto death. Believers in Christ are
called his "saints", because separated by his grace for his service, and
sanctified by his Spirit, and to whom he is made sanctification; and
because they live holy lives and conversations; all which is an
aggravation of the evil done them, and which will be avenged by Christ
in his own time.

[Acts 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 9:14</span></span>

And here he hath authority from the chief priests,.... His fury and
madness against the saints did not stop at Jerusalem, but he had
received a commission from the sanhedrim to go to Damascus, where he now
was:

to bind all that call on thy name; to take up all such persons and put
them in bonds, and carry them bound to Jerusalem, whom he should find
either praying to Christ, as God, as the first Christians used to do,
and which is no inconsiderable proof of the deity of Christ; or
professing the name of Christ, or were called by it.

[Acts 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 9:15</span></span>

But the Lord said unto him, go thy way,.... The Syriac version reads,
"arise, go thy way"; make no delay, nor any excuse, there is no reason
for it; nothing is to be feared from him:

for he is a chosen vessel unto me; a choice and excellent one, full of
the heavenly treasure of the Gospel, full of the gifts and graces of the
Spirit, and so very fit and richly qualified for the use and service of
Christ; and was , "a vessel of desire", or a desirable one, as the Jews
speak (n): or he was, to render the words literally, "a vessel of
election"; both an instrument gathering in the election, or the elect of
God, through the preaching of the Gospel; and was himself chosen of God,
both to grace and glory, a vessel of mercy, and of honour prepared for
glory; and was separated, predestinated, and appointed to the Gospel of
God, to preach it among the Gentiles; which sense is confirmed by what
follows:

to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of
Israel; by "the name" of Christ is meant his Gospel, which is a
declaration of his person, perfections, glories, and excellencies, of
his offices, grace, righteousness, and salvation; and to "bear" it, is
to preach it, to carry it about, spread abroad, and propagate it; in
allusion either to the prophets of old, whose prophecies are often
called a "burden", which they bore and carried to the several nations to
whom they were sent; or to the Levites bearing the tabernacle of the
Lord, and its vessels, "be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord",
[Isa 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md). Upon which Aben Ezra has
this note,

"they are the Israelites, , "that bear the law";''

but Saul was a chosen vessel to bear the Gospel; or to the sower of
seed, [Psa 126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006.md) "before the
Gentiles", or nations of the world; and he was an apostle, and teacher
of the Gentiles in faith and verity; the Gospel of the uncircumcision
was particularly committed to him: and before "kings", as he did before
Agrippa, king of the Jews, and before Nero, emperor of Rome; and his
bonds for the Gospel, and so the Gospel through his bonds became
manifest in all the palace, or court of Caesar. And before

the children of Israel; the Jews, to whom he first preached it; but when
they put it away he turned to the Gentiles, and afterwards, before the
Jews, he bore a testimony for it.

[Acts 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 9:16</span></span>

For I will show him,.... In vision, and by prophecy, either now, or
hereafter; or by facts, as they come upon him:

how great things he must suffer for my name's sake; such as weariness,
pain, and watchings, hunger, thirst, fastings, cold, and nakedness,
perils on various accounts, and from different quarters, stripes,
scourges, imprisonment, shipwreck, stoning, and death, of which he
himself gives a detail, [Co2 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md) so
that Ananias had no reason to be afraid to go to him, and converse with
him, and do unto him as he was directed.

[Acts 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 9:17</span></span>

And Ananias went his way,.... He arose from off his bed or seat, where
he was, went out of his house, and on the way to the place where Saul
was; he had nothing more to say, his objections were answered; there was
no room to excuse himself, nor did he now desire it, but quietly yields,
and cheerfully obeys:

and entered into the house; or "that house", the house of Judas, where
Saul was, and whither Ananias was directed, [Act
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011.md)

and putting his hands on him; on Saul, in the same form Saul had seen
him, in vision, doing it: and which was done, either as a prayer
gesture; or for the healing of him, the restoring him to his sight; or
that he might receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost; and it may be on all
these accounts: and

said, brother Saul; he calls him "brother", not because he was of the
same nation, but because he was now of the same faith; because he was a
regenerate person, and belonged to the family of God, and was of the
same household of faith: and this he said, not upon what he had received
from Saul's own mouth, for he addressed him in this manner as soon as he
came to him; but upon what the Lord had said concerning him; though it
was indeed common with the Jewish doctors to salute one another with
this name.

"When R. Jose ben Kisma was sick, R. Chanina ben Tradion went to visit
him; he said unto him, Chanina, "my brother, my brother", &c. (o).''

So Shemaiah called Abtalion his brother (p). And in like manner R.
Eleazar ben Azariah saluted R. Ishmael (q). And R. Joshua speaks of R.
Tarphon in the same language (r):

the Lord, even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest;
that is, who appeared to Saul as he was in the way to Damascus; not that
Jesus was in the way, for he was in heaven, and appeared from thence to
Saul, who was in the way: and he mentions Jesus by name, and this
appearance of his, partly to assure him of his mission from him; for
otherwise he could have known nothing of his appearance to him; and
partly to show the love of Christ to him, and though he had persecuted
him in so violent a manner, he had a compassionate regard for him; as
also to encourage and comfort him, who had been trembling, and
astonished at what he had heard from Jesus. This same glorious person,
adds he,

hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight; his bodily sight,
which he had been without three days, by the imposition of hands:

and be filled with the Holy Ghost; with the extraordinary gifts of the
Spirit, such as speaking with divers tongues, healing diseases, and the
like; for as for the graces of the Spirit, and even Gospel light and
knowledge, and gifts for preaching it, he had received these already.

[Acts 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 9:18</span></span>

And immediately there fell from his eyes, as it had been scales,....
Which were little thin skins or films, like the scales of fishes, which
were formed from the defluxions that fell from his brain, through the
excessive light that shone around him, and the surprise he was thrown
into by it: these, as soon as Ananias put his hands upon him, dropped
off; which were an emblem and representation of the scales of ignorance,
of himself, of sin, of righteousness, of the law, of the Gospel, and of
Jesus as the Messiah; and of unbelief in him, and of pride, malice, and
envy, and of superstition and bigotry, and of error and false doctrine,
which, upon his being enlightened by the Spirit of God, fell from him:

and he received sight forthwith; his corporeal sight, which was an
emblem of that spiritual sight he had also received: the word
"forthwith", or "immediately", is not in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and
Arabic versions, but seems necessary; and indeed, if it was not
expressed, it would be understood; for as soon as the scales fell from
his eyes, he must receive his sight: the Ethiopic version places it
after the word "baptized", in the next clause:

and arose, and was baptized; that is, after Ananias had appointed it to
him, as his duty, had pressed him to it, and called upon him to submit
to it without delay, [Act 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016.md) And
this shows that baptism was performed by immersion; for had it been done
in any other way, either by pouring or sprinkling a little water, Saul
might have kept his seat, and water might have been brought to him, and
so the ordinance might have been performed; but he arose and went,
either to a bath that might be in Judas's house, fit for such a purpose;
for the Jews had their baths to bathe their whole bodies in on certain
occasions; or he went to some certain place of water without doors,
convenient for the administration of baptism, where it was administered
by Ananias unto him. And this also may suggest to us, that only
enlightened persons are the proper objects of this ordinance; such as
have the scales of darkness, ignorance, and unbelief removed from them,
and have a spiritual sight and sense of divine things: hence the
ancients used to call baptism by the name of "illumination", and
baptized persons "enlightened" ones.

[Acts 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 9:19</span></span>

And when he had received meat,.... Which was set before him when he had
received his sight, and after he was baptized, of which he had not
tasted for three days:

he was strengthened; in body, being before very weak and feeble; not so
much through fatigue of his journey, as through the fear and surprise
the appearance of Christ to him, and his words, threw him into; as also
through his fasting so long, and his continuance and constancy in prayer
all this while, and the attention he gave to the divine instructions
which were communicated to him, internally and externally:

then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus;
who came from Jerusalem upon the persecution raised against them there;
with these Saul continued some few days after his conversion and
baptism, for quickly after he went into Arabia, as appears from [Gal
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017.md). These disciples, with the new
converts afterwards, it is highly probable, formed a church state in
Damascus; Ananias is said to be the bishop or pastor of it, and which
remained in several ages. In the catalogue of the council of Nice, which
was held in the beginning of the "fourth" century, Damascus is mentioned
as the seat of a church; in the "fifth" century a bishop of Damascus was
in the council at Ephesus; and in the same century it was reckoned a
metropolitan church in Asia; in the seventh century it appears there was
a church in this place; and even in the "eighth" century, though the
Arabians ravaged in those parts, yet still a church continued here for
some time, till Ulid, the prince of the Saracens, took away the temple
from the Christians of this place, and dedicated it to Mahomet; after
which we hear no more of the church at Damascus (s).

[Acts 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 9:20</span></span>

And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues,.... The Syriac
version adds, "of the Jews"; that is, which were in Damascus, [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002.md) from whence it appears, that he
was immediately, as soon as converted, qualified for the work of
preaching the Gospel: nor did he confer with flesh and blood, or stand
disputing and debating with himself and carnal reason, what was best for
him to do; but as soon as he knew Christ himself, he preached him to
others, and whom he always made the subject of his ministry; and
particularly,

that he is the Son of God; the only begotten of the Father, the eternal
Son of God, truly and properly God, of the same nature and essence with
God his Father, and equal to him. His design was to assert and maintain
the dignity of his person, which is the foundation of his office, as
Mediator, and of all the wonderful things he performed: had he meant no
more than that he was the Messiah, the sense would only be, that he
preached that Christ was the Christ; but the meaning is, that he
preached that Jesus of Nazareth, the true Messiah, was not a mere man,
but a divine person, even the Son of God: he set out in his ministry,
with the principal and most fundamental article of the Christian
religion, that which Christ asserted, and for which he suffered, and
which all the apostles, and first Christians believed. The Alexandrian
copy, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read "Jesus",
instead of "Christ".

[Acts 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 9:21</span></span>

But all that heard him were amazed,.... Not the disciples that believed
in Christ, but the unbelievers, as appears from their words:

and said, is not this he that destroyed them that called on this name in
Jerusalem? they do not express the name of Christ, out of malice and ill
will; which shows who they were that said these words, and were
astonished to hear Saul preaching in this name, and proving him to be
the Son of God, and the true Messiah; when it was but a little while ago
he consented to the death of Stephen, made havoc of the church, wasted
and destroyed it as much as was in his power, and persecuted unto death
such as called upon the name of Christ, or were called by his name, he
could find in Jerusalem: nor did this satisfy him, for it follows,

and came hither, that is, to Damascus,

for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests:
whom he should find professing or invocating the name of Christ, or
bearing it; now to see and hear him preach this same name, was
surprising to them.

[Acts 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 9:22</span></span>

But Saul increased the more in strength,.... Not of body, but of mind;
his gifts and graces, and spiritual light and knowledge increased; his
abilities were greater; his fortitude of mind, boldness, and freedom of
speech, every day increased: he got more, and new, and fresh arguments,
by which he himself was confirmed, and he confirmed others in the truths
of Christ. Some copies read, "he was more strengthened in the word";
either in the word of God, having a clearer understanding, and being
more confirmed in the truth of it; or in speech, being more ready and
powerful in speaking it.

And confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus; confuted them, and put
them to silence, so that they had nothing to say for themselves, or
against the truth:

proving that this is very Christ; by joining and knitting passages of
Scripture in the Old Testament together, by producing and citing express
testimonies from thence, and by comparing the prophecies and the
characters of the Messiah in them, with Jesus of Nazareth, he proved to
a demonstration that he must be the Messiah.

[Acts 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 9:23</span></span>

And after that many days were fulfilled,.... This phrase is used by the
Septuagint on [Exo 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#011.md) for a
considerable length of time, for many years. The Jewish writers observe
(t), that the phrase, "many days", signify at least three days; for by
"days", in the plural number, two must be designed, and many signifies a
third, or that one at least is added to them; but here it signifies
three years, as it also does, [Kg1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#001.md) where it is said, "and it came to
pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the
third year"; and such a space of time is designed by the many days here;
for when the apostle had stayed a little while at Damascus, and preached
Christ in the synagogues, he went into Arabia, where he continued about
three years, and then returned to Damascus, where what is related
happened to him; [Gal 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017.md).

the Jews took counsel to kill him; being filled with indignation at him,
that he had changed his religion, and from a persecutor was become a
preacher of the Gospel; this they had meditated some time, and now upon
his return to Damascus attempted to put their counsel into execution.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 9:24</span></span>

But their laying await was known of Saul,.... Either by divine
revelation, or by some friends, who had got knowledge of it, and gave
him information, as in [Act 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#016.md) and
they watched the gates night and day to kill him; that is, the Jews,
together with the governor of the city, and the garrison of soldiers in
it. These all watched at the several gates of the city, night and day,
that Saul might not make his escape, and that they might take him, and
put him to death.

[Acts 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 9:25</span></span>

Then the disciples took him by night,.... The Alexandrian copy reads,
"his disciples"; the disciples of Saul, such as he had been instrumental
in making at Damascus: but it is not usual for the saints to be called
in Scripture the disciples of any man; therefore the common reading is
best, and designs the disciples and followers of Christ; who being
concerned for the preservation of so valuable a life, took Saul in the
night season,

and let him down by the wall in a basket. Damascus was a walled city;
hence we read of the wall of Damascus, [Jer
49:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#027.md). And the house where Saul was,
and which very likely was one of the disciples, was built upon the wall,
as the house of Rahab was upon the town wall of Jericho; and as she let
down the spies from thence by a cord through the window, [Jos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#015.md) so the disciples let down Saul in
a basket with cords through the window of the house, as appears from
[Co2 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033.md). See Gill on [Co2
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033.md), no doubt, the disciples were
directed by the overruling providence of God, in order to preserve the
life of the apostle, who had much work to do for Christ in several parts
of the world, and therefore must not fall into the hands of his enemies
and die, his time not being yet come; and this shows, that it is lawful
to make use of all prudent means and proper methods to prevent the
designs of wicked men, and escape out of their hands, and preserve life
when in danger; by which means Saul escaped their hands.

[Acts 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 9:26</span></span>

And when Saul was come to Jerusalem,.... After he had escaped out of
Damascus, in the manner before related, and which was three years after
his conversion:

he assayed to join himself to the disciples; not to the private members
of the church, or ordinary disciples, as distinct from the apostles, but
to the whole society, as consisting of apostles and private Christians;
for his chief view in going to Jerusalem was to see Peter; and the
Ethiopic version reads, "to the apostles": the sense is, that he tried
either to get into a free and familiar conversation with them, or to
become one of their body, and a member of the church. He did not return
to the high priest from whom he had received letters to Damascus, to
give him an account of the execution of his commission, or what use he
had made of the letters he gave him, but to the disciples, against whom
he had breathed out threatenings and slaughter. Grace had made a strange
alteration in him; those whom he hated, and was exceeding mad against,
he now loves; they are the excellent ones in the earth in whom is all
his delight; and whom he persecuted to strange cities, he now courts
their company, and attempts to get among them; accounting it his
greatest honour and happiness to be one of their society. It is the duty
and interest of every gracious soul to join himself to a church of
Christ, which consists of the disciples of Christ, as the church at
Jerusalem did; of such who have learned Christ, and the way of life and
salvation by him; who have believed in him, and have been taught to deny
themselves for his sake, and to take up the cross and follow him, in the
way of his ordinances and appointments; and to be "joined" to a church,
is to become an open subject of Christ's kingdom, a citizen of the
heavenly Jerusalem, one of the family of God, and a member of the body
of Christ visibly. The phrase is expressive of that strict union there
is between the saints in church relation, and of that close and intimate
communion they have with each other, and shows that their incorporation
together is by mutual consent and agreement. And a great privilege it is
to be in such a relation, having the grace of God; for such have the
best of company, and the most refreshing ordinances; are in the greatest
safety, being under the watch and care of ministers and members, of
angels, and of God himself; and shall never be disfranchised, or become
foreigners and strangers; they may expect the presence of God, fresh
supplies of his grace, and even life for evermore, and need fear no
enemy. That which qualifies for church membership, is not natural
descent from religious parents, nor a religious education, nor mere
morality and civility, nor even a constant attendance on the word of
God, but faith in Christ Jesus, and a profession of it; and according to
the order of the Gospel it is necessary that baptism in water should go
before it; and these qualifications the apostle had.

But they were all afraid of him; knowing him to have been such an enemy
to Christ, and so violent a persecutor of his church in times past:

and believed not that he was a disciple; or a true follower of Christ,
but only pretended to be one, having some wicked design upon them in
attempting to get among them: the reason of their not knowing anything
of his conversion might be, because not only of the distance between
Damascus and Jerusalem, and the continuance of the persecution in the
latter place, which might occasion few comers to and fro of the
Christians; but because the apostle, soon after his conversion, went to
Arabia, where he had been all this while. Hence it appears, that the
primitive churches were very careful in the admission of persons into
fellowship with them; as they could not bear them in their communion who
were evil, so they would not admit any among them but such as they
looked upon to be the true disciples of Christ: and this is a method
worthy of imitation; and such persons who, before a profession of
religion, have been either very scandalous in their lives and
conversations, or notorious enemies to Christ and his Gospel, ought to
be thoroughly examined into, and full satisfaction obtained concerning
them, ere they be received into the bosom of the church.

[Acts 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 9:27</span></span>

But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles,.... To Peter and
James, the brother of our Lord, for no other apostles did he see at this
time, [Gal 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018.md). It is probable that
Barnabas had been at Damascus, and had there related to him, the whole
account of Saul's conversion and entrance on the ministry, which he
gives a particular relation of, as follows:

and declared unto them, how he had seen the Lord in the way; he told the
apostles, Peter and James, how that Christ had appeared to him in
person, as he was on his way to Damascus:

and that he had spoken to him; and expostulated with him about his
persecution of him in his members, and bid him go into the city, where
it should be told him what he should do:

and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus; that he
had used great freedom of speech, and had shown courage and greatness of
mind in preaching Christ at Damascus, both as soon as he was converted,
and now upon his return thither. Hence it is manifest, that previous to
admission into a church of Christ, and in order to satisfy the members
of it, and gain their assent to such an admission, there ought to be a
declaration made of the work of grace upon the souls of such, who
propose to be joined to it; as how the Lord has met with them, and shown
them the evil of their ways, and given them repentance unto life; and
how they have had a sight of him by faith, and have looked to Christ and
believed in him for the salvation of their souls; and how they have
embraced the doctrines of the Gospel, and have found much sweetness and
comfort in them; and that from a principle of love to him, and faith in
him, and with a view to his glory, they are willing to submit to his
ordinances, and to walk in holy fellowship with his people; and such an
account of Saul being given by Barnabas, who had had it from him; and
this being, no doubt, declared and attested by Saul himself, he was
received into fellowship with the disciples: hence it follows,

[Acts 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 9:28</span></span>

And be was with them,.... Peter and James, and the rest of the
disciples; he lived with them, conversed with them, and joined with them
in all religious exercises; which is signified by his

coming in and going out at Jerusalem; no one of the apostles or
disciples forbidding or hindering him.

[Acts 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 9:29</span></span>

And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus,.... He spoke the
Gospel of Christ boldly, as it ought to be spoken; he spoke it openly,
publicly, freely, and faithfully, not fearing the faces or revilings of
any: the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions add, "to the Gentiles"; but
this is not in any of the Greek copies: and disputed against the
Grecians; or Hellenists, that is, the Hellenistical Jews; by whom are
meant, not Greeks proselyted to the Jewish religion, but Jews who had
been born and brought up in Greece, or at least had learned the Greek
language, and used the Greek Bible; and so the Syriac version renders
it, "he disputed with the Jews that knew Greek"; perhaps the same
persons, of the synagogue of the Libertines, Alexandrians, Cyrenians,
and of Cilicia and Asia, who disputed with Stephen, with whom he had
before joined, [Act 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009.md)

but they went about to slay him; he being an over match for them; and
they not being able to resist him, but being confuted, and confounded,
and put to silence, they were filled with indignation; and since they
could not conquer him by arguments, they were for slaying him with the
sword.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 9:30</span></span>

Which when the brethren knew,.... When the members of the church heard
of it, by some means or another:

they brought him down to Caesarea; not that which was before called
Strato's tower, the same as in [Act
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md) but Caesarea Philippi, mentioned
in [Mat 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013.md) the Syriac version adds,
"by night", and some copies, "and sent him forth to Tarsus"; a city of
Cilicia, his own native place, where he might be more safe, and also
useful among his friends and acquaintance; [Gal
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#021.md).

[Acts 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 9:31</span></span>

Then had the churches rest,.... Meaning not spiritual rest in Christ;
this they had before, even in tribulation, but rest from persecution;
not so much because of the conversion of Saul, the great persecutor of
them, for his conversion had been three years before; but rather because
of his removal to other parts, the sight of whose person, and especially
his ministry, had afresh stirred up the Jews to wrath and fury. The
Alexandrian copy, and some others, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and
Ethiopic versions, read in the singular number, "the church": but the
several countries hereafter mentioned shows that more are designed: for
it follows,

throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria; for by means of the
dispersion, on account of persecution, the Gospel was preached in these
several places, and churches gathered, and which shared in the
persecution until this time, when they began to have rest; [Gal
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#022.md) [Th1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014.md) and were edified; or built up on
the foundation Christ, and their most holy faith, through the ministry
of the word and ordinances, and their mutual love and holy conversation;
and had an increase of members, and of grace, and of spiritual
knowledge:

and walking in the fear of the Lord; which was always before their eyes,
and upon their hearts, continuing in religious exercises, and in the
discharge of every duty, both to God and man. Not in a slavish fear of
the wrath of the Lord, and of damnation for sin committed against him;
for this is not consistent with their characters, as Gospel churches,
made of persons who had received not the spirit of bondage to fear, but
the Spirit of adoption, nor with their edification in faith and
holiness; for "he that feareth is not made perfect in love"; [Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018.md) which edifies; nor with the
comforts of the Holy Ghost, they are afterwards said to walk in: but in
a godly fear, which has the Lord for its author, is not of a man's self,
but of the grace of God, and is encouraged and increased by the
discoveries of his grace and goodness: and which has the Lord for its
object, whose name is holy and reverend, and is to be feared by all his
saints: it shows itself in an hatred of sin; in a departure from it; in
a carefulness not to offend the Lord; in withholding nothing from him,
though ever so dear and valuable, he calls for; and in attending to all
the parts of divine worship: and walking in it denotes a continuance in
it, a constant progression in all the acts of internal and external
worship, which are both included in the fear of the Lord; and it
requires strength, and supposes pleasure and freedom. It is said of
Enoch, that "he walked with God"; which the Targum of Onkelos
paraphrases, "he walked in the fear of the Lord", [Gen
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md) the same phrase which is here
used.

And in the comfort of the Holy Ghost: which he communicated by shedding
abroad the love of God in them, taking the things of Christ, and showing
them to them, applying covenant blessings and Gospel promises to their
souls, owning the word and ordinances, and making them useful to them,
thereby leading them into fellowship with the Father, and with the Son.
In all which he acts the part of a Comforter, and answers to the
character he bears, and the office he is in: the love of God, which he
directs into, and sheds abroad in the heart, refreshes and revives the
Spirit of God's people; it influences and encourages every grace that is
wrought in them; and makes them easy and comfortable under all
providences, even the most afflicting ones: the things of Christ he
takes and shows unto them are his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice;
which being applied, and interest in them shown, produce abundance of
peace, joy, and comfort: the promises of the covenant, and of the
Gospel, he opens and applies, being such as hold forth the blessings of
grace unto them; and being exceeding great, and precious, and suitable
to their cases; and being absolute and unconditional, immutable, and
sure, afford them much pleasure and satisfaction: and the word and
ordinances being attended with the Holy Ghost, and much assurance, are
breasts of consolation to them: and "walking" in those comforts which he
administers, by such means, denotes a continuance of them, a long
enjoyment of them, which is not very common; for, generally speaking,
these comforts last but for a small time; and also it intimates much
delight and pleasure in them, [Psa

in their gifts and graces, and in the number of converts added to them.

And it came to pass, as Peter passed through all quarters,.... The
Arabic version reads, "all the foresaid places", as Judea, Galilee, and
Samaria; through which he took a tour, in order to visit the new
churches here planted, fix pastors over them, and confirm the Gospel by
miracles, which they had received:

he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda: a city which lay
on the west of Jerusalem, and is said (u) to be a day's Journey from it;
and a day's journey were ten parsas, or forty miles (w): it was but
thirty two miles from Jerusalem, and was a place famous for Jewish
doctors; for which reason it is frequently mentioned in the Talmudic
writings, under the name of Lod or Lud. Mention is made of R. Simlai,
who was of Lydda (x), and of the chambers of Beth Nithzah, and of Arum
in Lydda (y) where the doctors disputed; there was a school here, of
which R. Akiba was president (z) here also the sanhedrim sometimes sat,
since we are told that Ben Sutda was tried and stoned at Lud or Lydda
(a); and here likewise they intercalated the year (b), it being in
Judea: this place was situated in a plain; so says Jerom (c),

"they that dwell in Sephela, that is, in the plain, Lydda and Emmaus,
which design Diospolls and Nicopolis, shall possess the Philistines.''

And with this agrees the account the Talmudists (d) give of it,

"the country of Judea was divided into three parts, the hill country,
the plain, and the valley; from Bethhoron to Emmaus was the hill
country; from Emmaus to Lydda was the plain or champaign country; and
from Lydda to the sea, the valley.''

Hence also we read (e) of , "the plain of Lydda": and now Peter coming
from Jerusalem, and the hill country of Judea, into this plain and
champaign country, is properly said to come down to the saints there. So
Quadratus in Josephus (f) is said to come up from Lydda to Jerusalem.
This place was near the Mediterranean sea; and was in Jerom's time
called Diospolis (g), and in the time of R. Benjamin (h) Seguras; it is
the same with Lod in [Ezr 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#033.md) The
builder of it was Shamed the son of Elpaal, [Ch1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012.md). It was in the times of Josephus
(i) a village, yet not inferior to a city for greatness. It is now
called S. Georgia. And here it seems some saints or Christians dwelt,
whom Peter, among the rest, visited; and which is mentioned for the sake
of the miracle he there wrought, next related. And these saints at Lydda
very likely were converted under Philip's ministry, as he passed from
Azotus to Caesarea, [Act 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md) and, it
may be, were in a church state, or, however, were afterwards. Zenas the
lawyer, the Apostle Paul speaks of in [Tit
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013.md) is said to be bishop of
Diospolis, or Lydda; in the beginning of the fourth century Aetius was
bishop of this place, who assisted in the council of Nice; and in the
same century, anno 331, Dionysius, another bishop of this place, was
present at a council at Constantinople; and in the fifth century
Photinus wrote himself bishop of Lydda, in the Chalcedon council, anno
451 (k).

And there he found a certain man,.... In a house in that city, into
which he entered:

named Aeneas; which is a Gentile name, and so might the person be;
though there is mention made of this name among the Jews. We read of one
R. Samuel Bar, "Aenea, or Aeneas" (l); but it was more common among the
Greeks. Aeneas the Trojan is well known in history, who, after the
destruction of Troy, went into Italy, and settled there; and from him
the Trojans are sometimes called Aeneadae. The name comes from the Greek
word "ainoo", which signifies "to praise"; and Aeneas is one "worthy of
praise": though Jerom (m) takes it to be an Hebrew name, which he
interprets "one that answers", or a "poor man", or "misery"; as if it
came from the Hebrew word "anah", which signifies "to answer, or to
afflict".

Which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy; so that
the distemper was grown stubborn, and thought incurable; nor perhaps had
he, or his friends, any hope of his ever being restored to health again.

And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, &c. He called him by his name, which he
might without divine revelation know, though he was a stranger to him,
by the people of the house, where he was:

Jesus Christ maketh thee whole; Peter knew, by some secret impulse upon
his mind, that Christ would cure this man by him as an instrument at
this time, and therefore said these words; not as a prayer, as some
render them, "may Jesus Christ heal thee", though was it so, it was a
prayer of faith; but as a promise that he would, or rather as a
declaration of the then present exertion of his power to heal him; which
he ascribes not to himself, but to Christ, in whose name, and by whose
power the apostles wrought all their miracles; [Act
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md) "arise, and make thy bed"; which
would be a full demonstration that he was perfectly whole:

and he arose immediately; and also, no doubt, made his bed, as the man
at Bethesda's pool was bid by Christ, to take up his bed and carry it,
as a proof of his soundness.

And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron,.... Saron, which is here joined
to Lydda, is the name of a fruitful country on the borders of the
Mediterranean sea, between Joppa and Caesarea, beginning at Lydda. There
were two countries in the land of Israel called Saron, as Jerom observes
(n); there was one between Mount Tabor, and the lake of Tiberias; and
there was another which reached from Caesarea of Palestine, to the town
of Joppa; the former was inhabited by the Gadites, and was beyond
Jordan, [Ch1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#016.md) the other was on
this side Jordan, near Lydda. And this is what is here meant; and of
which the same writer elsewhere says (o), the whole country by Joppa and
Lydda is called Saron, in which are large and fruitful fields; and on
[Isa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#010.md) which the Vulgate Latin
renders, "and the plains shall be for folds of flocks", he observes,
that "Sharon", in the Hebrew text, is put for plains or champaign
country; and adds, all the country about Lydda, Joppa, and Jamnia, is
fit to feed flocks: and agreeably to this, in Jewish writings, the
calves of Sharon (p) are spoken of as the best; and the word is by the
commentators of the Misna interpreted (q) by "a plain", or champaign
country; for this was not the name of a single town or city, but of a
country, bordering on Lydda, and the above mentioned places; in which
were several towns and villages, and the inhabitants of those that were
nearest Lydda are here designed. It was such a fruitful and delightful
country, that the Targum on [Sol 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md)
has rendered it by the garden of Eden: it had its name either from
"Shur", which signifies to behold afar off, from the fine and large
prospect that might be taken on it; or from "Shar", which signifies the
navel, because it was a valley or plain surrounded on every side with
mountains and hills: it abounded in flowers and fruits; hence mention is
made of the rose of Sharon, [Sol 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md)
and in vines; hence we frequently read of the wine of Saron (r), and
which was so very good, that they mixed two parts of water with one of
wine (s). It was a country, the Jews say (t), whose earth was not fit to
make bricks of; and therefore houses made of them did not stand long,
but needed repairing often in seven years: hence the high priest, on the
day of atonement, used to pray for the Saronites, that their houses
might not become their graves (u). Now when the inhabitants of this
place, as well as of Lydda,

saw him; that is, Aeneas, made whole, who had been ill of a palsy, and
had kept his bed eight years, they were so impressed with it, that it
issued in their conversion:

and turned to the Lord: they believed in Christ, embraced his Gospel
preached by Peter, professed faith in him, and submitted to his
ordinances; being turned by powerful efficacious grace, they turned
their feet to keep his testimonies.

Now there was at Joppa,.... The same with Japho, [Jos
19:46](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#046.md) a sea port town in the tribe of
Dan, said by some historians (w) to be a very ancient one, even before
the flood. It is now called Jaffa, and its name, in the Hebrew tongue,
signifies beauty: some say it had its name from Jope, the daughter of
Aeolus, the wife of Cepheus, the founder of it; and others derive it
from the name of Japhet, because it looks towards Europe, which is
inhabited by the sons of Japhet. It was built upon a hill, as Pliny (x)
says; and so high, as Strabo (y) reports, that Jerusalem, the metropolis
of Judea, might be seen from thence, which was distant from it forty
miles; as may be concluded from what Jerom, (z) says, who lived at
Bethlehem many years: his words are; from Joppa, to our little village
Bethlehem, are forty six miles; now Bethlehem was six miles distant from
Jerusalem, to the south of it, and Joppa was to the west of it. The
place is well known by Jonah's taking ship there, and going for
Tarshish, when he was cast into the sea, and devoured by a fish; from
whence the Ionian sea might have its name: and this was the occasion of
the fable of Andromeda being exposed to a fish of a prodigious size at
this place; the bones of which, Pliny (a) relates, were brought to Rome
from hence, being forty foot long; and, the stones, to which she was
bound, Jerom (b) says, were shown in his time on this shore: and here
also, the inhabitants report, may be seen some stones in the sea, on
which Peter stood and fished, when he dwelt in this place.

A certain disciple, called Tabitha; this was a woman's name, the
masculine name was Tabi. R. Gamaliel had a manservant of this name (c),
and also a maidservant, whose name was Tabitha (d); yea, every
maidservant of his was called mother Tabitha, and every manservant
father Tabi (e):

which by interpretation is called Dorcas; which signifies a roe in the
Greek language, as Tabitha does in the Syriac:

this woman was full of good works; was constantly employed in doing
good; her works were both many and good:

and alms deeds which she did; she was very kind and beneficent to the
poor; she wrought with her hands much for their sakes, as appears by
what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 9:37</span></span>

And it came to pass in those days,.... While Peter was in those parts,
and particularly at Lydda, which was near:

that she was sick and died; fell ill with some disorder, and died of it:

whom, when they had washed; as was the manner of the Jews; and this they
did, even though it was on a sabbath day: for so their canon runs (f),

"they do all the necessaries for the dead (on the sabbath), they anoint
him, "and they wash him";''

yet that of Maimonides deserves some notice (g);

"it is forbidden to anoint part of the body, as the whole body; but if
it is to remove filth, it is lawful; and so it is forbidden to wash part
of the body with hot water, but with cold water they may wash his face,
his hands, and his feet, but not the whole body.''

This custom still continues, and their usual method is to wash the body
with hot water, in which they put dried roses and camomile flowers:
likewise, they take an egg, and beat it up in wine, and therewith anoint
the head; and this washing and anointing are done by some at the house
before the corpse is carried out (as here); but in some places,
especially where there is a large number of Jews, all this is done in
the burying places; where they have a little house, whither they carry
the corpse, and put it on a table, and there wash it; and after washing,
put, it into a coffin, and inter it (h): and this has been the custom of
other nations, if not of all nations: the custom with the Turks is this
(i); the body being laid upon a board, and covered with a linen cloth,
one of the ecclesiastical elders washes it with hot water and soap,
another being present to hand the water; but they do not suffer others
to look on: the body is thrice washed; and the third time they mingle
camphire with it; and being washed, it is put into a coffin. And
Ludolphus (k) reports of the Abyssines, that their bodies being well
washed and perfumed, they wrap them up in garments, and then are put
upon a bier, and buried. And this was the practice both of the ancient
Grecians and Romans, that as soon as ever anyone was dead, the body was
immediately washed and anointed. Thus Creon is said to fetch Jocaste to
wash her dead son; and Antigone requests of Creon, that she might wash
her brother (l). It has been the custom of some countries to wash their
dead bodies in rivers: and some people, in the northern parts, have
chose, for this reason, to have their burying places near the banks of
rivers, that their dead bodies might be washed in running water: and the
Indians, which live at a distance from the river Ganges, will go fifteen
or twenty days journey thither, to wash their corpse in it, though then
putrefied, and then burn them; yea, they take their sick alive when they
think they will die, and put them up to their middle in rivers, that
they may die in pure and clear water; and they enjoin a very severe
penance on those who omit to bring such as are near death, to a river to
be washed (m):

they laid her in an upper chamber. The Ethiopic version reads quite the
reverse; "they put her in the lower part of the house": which is not
likely. Dr. Lightfoot conjectures that this upper chamber might be the
common meeting place of the saints; and that they put her here, that if
Peter should work a miracle all might be spectators of it; and certain
it is, that the Jewish doctors used to meet in upper rooms, and confer
together; See Gill on [Mar 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004.md), and
such there were in Lydda; See Gill on [Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013.md) and such there were in Lydda;

And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa,.... Some say it was six miles
distant, but it must be eight; since from Jerusalem to Joppa were forty
miles, and from Jerusalem to Lydda thirty two, and therefore it must be
eight miles from thence to Joppa:

and the disciples had heard that Peter was there; and also no doubt that
he had healed Aeneas of his palsy, and which might induce them to do as
follows:

they sent unto him two men; very likely of their own company or church;
for it is certain here were disciples or believers in Christ, and very
likely were formed into a church state; these seem to be converts under
Philip's ministry, who when he went from Azotus, preached in all the
cities, and so in Joppa, till he came to Caesarea, [Act
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md) though we read nothing in
ecclesiastical history of this church at Joppa, until the fifth century,
when it appears there was a church in that place (n); and in the same
century we read of Fidus bishop of Joppa, that was present in the synod
held at Ephesus, anno 431 and in the sixth century of Elias bishop of
the same place, in the council at Jerusalem, anno 536 (o) and in the
same century a bishop of the church here assisted in the synod of Rome
and Constantinople (p).

desiring him, that he would not delay to come to them; they entreated he
would not refuse to come, and think it too great a burden on him, or
make any difficulty about it, or show any aversion to it; but that he
would with all readiness and cheerfulness, and without delay immediately
come unto them; for the case they wanted him for required speed and
haste.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 9:39</span></span>

Then Peter arose and went with them,.... After the messengers had
delivered their message, and made their request to Peter in the name of
the brethren, he at once agreed to go with them, and accordingly did;
whether he went to restore Dorcas to life, whose death the messengers
had informed him of, and whether this was the view of the brethren with
respect to that, is not certain. However, he might go with them on other
accounts, as to comfort them under the loss of so valuable and useful a
person, and to strengthen and establish them in the faith, and to exhort
and animate them to the discharge of their duty.

When he was come; that is, to Joppa, and to Dorcas's house there:

they brought him into the upper chamber; where the corpse of Dorcas lay:

and all the widows stood by him weeping; these were poor widows, to whom
Dorcas had been very liberal and beneficent, who stood about the apostle
lamenting the death of their benefactress, and by their tears expressing
their desire of her return to life, if it could be:

and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with
them; the Vulgate, Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read, "which
Dorcas made for them"; and the Syriac version renders it, "which Tabitha
gave unto them, while she was alive"; which last clause aptly explains,
"while she was with them"; for now she was not, with respect to her
better part, her immortal soul: the coats and garments were the inner
and upper ones, wore in these countries; and it seems that she did not
buy these garments, and give them unto them, but that she made them up
herself for them, or at least wrought with them in making of them; which
shows her diligence and industry, as also her humility, as well as her
beneficence: and these the widows produced, and are shown as proofs of
the same; which was expressive of gratitude in them, and was done with a
design to move Peter to be concerned for restoring so useful a life.

But Peter put them all forth,.... As he had seen his Lord and Master do,
when he raised the daughter of Jairus from the dead, [Luk
8:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#054.md)

and kneeled down and prayed; it may be, as yet, he had not the mind of
God in this matter, and therefore betook himself to prayer, in which he
chose to be private and alone:

and turning him to the body; the corpse of Dorcas, after he had prayed,
and was well assured that the power of Christ would be exerted in
raising of it:

said, Tabitha, arise; which words were spoken in the name and faith of
Christ, and were all one as, if Christ himself had spoken them; for to
his power, and not to the apostles, is the following miracle to be
ascribed: and she opened her eyes; which, upon her death, had been
closed by her friends; and perhaps the napkin was not yet bound about
her face: or if it was, she must remove it ere she could open her eyes
and see Peter:

and when she saw Peter; whom she might know:

she sat up; upon the bed or bier on which she lay.

[Acts 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 9:41</span></span>

And he gave her his hand, and lift her up,.... Off of the bed or bier
where she was:

and when he had called the saints and widows; the disciples, brethren
and sisters, who were come together on this occasion, as well as the
poor widows she had been kind to; the Ethiopic version reads without a
copulative, "the holy widows"; and so might these widows be, even such
as are described in [Ti1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010.md)

presented her alive; as Christ did the widow's son of Naam to her, [Luk
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#015.md) and which no doubt was matter of
great joy as well as astonishment to all the saints, and especially to
the poor widows.

And it was known throughout all Joppa,.... The report of such a miracle,
and wrought upon a person of note, was soon spread all over the place,
which was very large, for it was a city, as it is called, [Act
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#005), and it had, as Josephus (q.md)
says, villages and little towns or cities round about it; all which
might go by the name of Joppa, and throughout which the fame of this
miracle might pass:

and many believed in the Lord; in the Lord Jesus Christ, whom Peter
preached, and the saints in Joppa professed, and in whose name, and by
whose power, this miracle was done.

And it came to pass,.... Or so it was;

that he tarried many days in Joppa; conversing with the saints,
confirming the disciples, and preaching the Gospel, to the conversion of
sinners; and his abode

was with one Simon a tanner; it seems as if persons of this trade used
to dwell in towns near the sea, as fit for their business; so we read of
some at Sidon, a city on the sea coast, as Joppa was;

"it happened at Sidon that a certain "tanner", (the same word here used,
adopted into the Hebrew language,) died, and he had a brother a tanner,
&c. (r)''

where the Gemara (s) distinguishes between a great tanner and a little
tanner; the latter, the gloss says, is one that is poor and has but few
skins: which of these Simon was, cannot be said. This business was very
contemptible with the Jews; they say (t),

"woe to him whose trade is a tanner:''

and further observe (u) that they never make one a king, nor a high
priest: but their doctors many of them were of as mean trades, as
shoemakers, skinners, &c. See Gill on [Mar
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003.md) and Simon the Athenian philosopher
was "a leather cutter" (w); and according to the Ethiopic version, this
our Simon was a shoemaker; with him Peter chose to abide, and not with
Dorcas.
