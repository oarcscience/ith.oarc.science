[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 2:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 2

This chapter begins with the twelve sons of Israel or Jacob, [Ch1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001), then reckons the sons of Judah,
the fourth son of Jacob, [Ch1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003),
then the posterity of Pharez and Zerah, sons of Judah, [Ch1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#005), next the sons of Hezron, a son of
Pharez, [Ch1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009), particularly the
posterity of Ram, a son of Hezron, from whom sprung Jesse and his
family, [Ch1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#010), then of Caleb:
another son of Hezron, [Ch1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018), and
next of Jerahmeel, the firstborn of Hezron, [Ch1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#025) and particularly the posterity of
Sheshan, a descendant of his, [Ch1
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#034) and then other sons of Caleb,
with their posterity, are reckoned, [Ch1
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#042) and the chapter is closed with
the families of the Scribes in Jabesh, the same with the Kenites, [Ch1
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055).

[1 Chronicles 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 2:1</span></span>

These are the sons of Israel,.... Or Jacob, the other son of Isaac, who
had the name of Israel given him, because of his power with God, [Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028), whose twelve sons are here
mentioned by name; the first four according to their birth of Leah,
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; then the two sons of Zilpah, Leah's
handmaid, Issachar and Zebulun; and between Dan and Naphtali, the sons
of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, are placed Joseph and Benjamin, the sons
of Rachel.

[1 Chronicles 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 2:3</span></span>

The sons of Judah,.... The genealogy begins with him, though the fourth
son of Jacob; because, as Kimchi says, this book treats chiefly of the
kings of Judah; but rather not only because Jesse and David sprang from
him, but also the King Messiah:

Er, and Onan, and Shelah, which three were born unto him of the daughter
of Shua the Canaanitess; see [Gen
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#002),

and Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the sight of the Lord;
because he did that which was evil:

and he slew him; he died by the immediate hand of God, and so his
brother Onan, being wicked also, [Gen
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#007).

[1 Chronicles 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 2:4</span></span>

And Tamar his daughter in law bare him Pharez and Zerah,.... Through
incest; they were twins, [Gen 38:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#027)
all the sons of Judah were five; who are before mentioned by name.

[1 Chronicles 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 2:5</span></span>

The sons of Pharez,.... One of the above twins, born to Judah:

Hezron and Hamul; see [Gen 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012).

[1 Chronicles 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 2:6</span></span>

And the sons of Zerah,.... The other twin of Judah:

Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara: five of them in all;
the Targum calls them governors, and adds, on whom the spirit of
prophecy dwelt; and in the Jewish chronology (n) they are said to
prophesy in Egypt; and the four last are supposed to be the same with
those in [Kg1 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031). See Gill on [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031).

\(n\) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 20. p. 52.

[1 Chronicles 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 2:7</span></span>

And the sons of Carmi,.... The Targum adds, this is Zimri; but in [Jos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001) Carmi is said to be the son of
Zabdi, who seems to be the same with Zimri; and some supply the word
here, and read (o) the sons of Zimri, Carmi, Achar, who was the grandson
of Zimri; his proper name was Achan, [Jos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001), but called Achar here by way of
reproach, as Jarchi and others observe; being, as it follows:

the troubler of Israel, as Achar signifies: "who transgressed in the
thing accursed"; devoted to the Lord, by taking it away for his own use,
see [Jos 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017), hence the valley in
which he was put to death was called Achor, [Jos
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026).

\(o\) So Junius & Tremellius, & Piscator.

[1 Chronicles 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 2:8</span></span>

And the sons of Ethan; Azariah. Including his posterity, see [Gen
46:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#023), the posterity of the other
three sons of Zerah are not mentioned, either because the writer could
not find the genealogy of them, as Kimchi; or rather, as he thinks, he
cuts short the genealogy of Zerah, because the kingdom did not proceed
from him, and returns to the genealogy of Hezron, from whence it did, or
perhaps they had no children.

[1 Chronicles 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 2:9</span></span>

The sons also of Hezron, that were born unto him,.... The Targum adds,
in Timnath; but most likely in Egypt:

Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai; afterwards called Caleb.

[1 Chronicles 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 2:10</span></span>

And Ram begat Amminadab,.... Ram is the same with Aram, [Mat
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003) the genealogy is carried down from
him to Jesse in the same order as there, and in [Rut
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#019) only here Nahshon the son of
Amminadab is called

the prince of the children of Judah; which Kimchi and Jarchi say is
written for the honour of David, who descended from him; and Salmon his
son is here called Salma.

[1 Chronicles 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 2:13</span></span>

And Jesse begat his firstborn Eliab, and Abinadab the second, and Shimma
the third, Nathanael the fourth, Raddai the fifth, Ozem the sixth, David
the seventh. But Jesse had eight sons, [Sa1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#010), one of them therefore is not
reckoned, either because he was by another woman, and the writer only
mentions those that were of the same mother with David; this is the
opinion of Aben Ezra and Kimchi; some say he was dead before David came
to the kingdom; Kimchi mentions a Midrash, or exposition of theirs,
according to which his name was Elihu, and was younger than David, who
is mentioned in [Ch1 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#018), and Jarchi
observes, that the writer, having found the pearl (David), reckons not
the eighth son Elihu, though the Syriac and Arabic versions have
inserted him in this order, "Elihu the seventh, David the eighth"; some
take the eighth to be a grandson of Jesse, Jonathan the son of Shimea,
[Sa2 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#021) the third son of Jesse,
here called Shimma, as he is Shammah, [Sa1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#009).

[1 Chronicles 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 2:16</span></span>

Whose sisters were Zeruiah and Abigail..... That is, sisters of David:

and the sons of Zeruiah; Abishai, and Joab, and Asahel, three; all
valiant men and captains in David's army; their father's name is nowhere
mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 2:17</span></span>

And Abigail bare Amasa,.... Who was Absalom's general, afterwards
reconciled to David, and designed to be made general of his army, but
was slain by Joab, see [Sa2 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025),

and the father of Amasa was Jether the Ishmaelite; he is called an
Israelite, [Sa2 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025), and so in the
Targum here, he being either a proselyte, or else he was an Israelite by
birth, but called an Ishmaelite, because he had dwelt among the
Ishmaelites some time, as Obededom is called the Gittite for the like
reason; so Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it.

[1 Chronicles 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 2:18</span></span>

And Caleb the son of Hezron,.... The same that is called Chelubai, [Ch1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009) but not the same with Caleb the
son of Jephunneh, made mention of in the books of Numbers, Joshua, and
Judges:

he begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth; who were both his
wives; or it may be rather, since Azubah is so particularly called his
wife, Jerioth might be a concubine: or of Azubah he begat Jerioth; so
the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions; though it seems best
with Hillerus (p) to interpret these names of the same person, and
render the last clause, "that is, of Jerioth", of her whose name also
was Jerioth, Azubah having two names; and the rather, since only the
children of one are mentioned, as follows:

her sons are these; Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon of whom we read
nowhere else; the Targum says, Azubah was so called, because she was
barren and despised, which this clause contradicts.

\(p\) Onomastic. Sacr. p. 568.

[1 Chronicles 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 2:19</span></span>

And when Azubah was dead, Caleb took unto him Ephrath,.... The Targum
is, "Miriam, who was called Ephrath"; but, according to Josephus (q), it
was his son Hur that was the husband of Miriam the sister of Moses:

which bare him Hur; See Gill on [Exo
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#010).

\(q\) Antiqu. l. 3. c. 2.

[1 Chronicles 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 2:20</span></span>

And Hur begat Uri, and Uri begat Bezaleel. Who yet is not thought to be
the same Bezaleel we read of in [Exo
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002) though the fathers and
grandfathers of both have the same names, and were of the same tribe.

[1 Chronicles 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 2:21</span></span>

And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the father of
Gilead,.... Which Machir was the son of Manasseh, and Gilead was his
grandson, [Num 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029) the Targum
is,"but he enticed a virgin, the daughter of Machir;''which suggests,
that he committed fornication with her, though he afterwards married
her; her name is not mentioned; to me it seems to be Abiah, [Ch1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024) and whom the Targum there calls
the daughter of Machir:

whom he married when he was sixty years old; the Targum is sixty six;
this seems to be his last wife:

and she bare him Segub; the same name with the youngest son of Hiel, who
rebuilt Jericho, [Kg1 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034).

[1 Chronicles 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 2:22</span></span>

And Segub begat Jair, who had twenty three cities in the land of Gilead.
Which, according to Kimchi, he inherited in right of his wife, which, he
says, he took out of the land of Gilead; but they seem to be rather what
he took by force of arms from the former inhabitants; see [Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041).

[1 Chronicles 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 2:23</span></span>

And he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair, from them,....
Cities or countries which the Geshurites and Aramaeans, or Syrians,
before inhabited; and which he took from them, together with other
towns, which, being taken by him, were called after his name; the Targum
is, the Geshurites and Aramaeans took the villages of Jair from them;
that is, from the sons of Jair in later times; see [Jos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005).

with Kenath, and the towns thereof; which Jair took by Nobah his
general, and called it after his name, [Num
32:42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#042), even sixty cities; see [Deu
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004).

all these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead: being
given him by Moses, [Num 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#040).

[1 Chronicles 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 2:24</span></span>

And after that Hezron was dead in Calebephratah,.... Supposed to be the
same with Bethlehem; and was so called, both from Caleb the son of
Hezron, and Ephrath his wife, [Ch1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019),

then Abiah, Hezron's wife, bare him Ashur the father of Tekoa; being
left with child by him at his death; the whole verse is paraphrased thus
in the Targum,"and after Hezron died in the house of Caleb his son in
Ephrath, the wife of Hezron the daughter of Machir was left with child,
and she bare to him after his death Ashur the prince of the
Tekoites;''whose son gave name very probably to the city of Tekoa, [Sa2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002).

[1 Chronicles 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 2:25</span></span>

And the sons of Jerahmeel, the firstborn of Hezron, were Ram the
firstborn,.... So called by his father after the name of his brother,
see [Ch1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009).

and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, and Ahijah; or "of Ahijah", as some (r)
render it, this being the name of his wife, who bare him the sons before
named, since mention is made of another wife in the next verse.

\(r\) Junius, Tremellius, Piscator, Michaelis.

[1 Chronicles 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 2:26</span></span>

Jerahmeel had also another wife, whose name was Atarah,.... Distinct
from his wife before named; or "another woman", which is a phrase for an
harlot or concubine, [Jdg 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#002) which
she might be, as Kimchi observes; though the former seems best:

she was the mother of Onam; and perhaps was the only son she bore to
Jerahmeel, of whose sons see [Ch1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#028).

[1 Chronicles 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 2:27</span></span>

And the sons of Ram the firstborn of Jerahmeel,.... By his first wife:

were Maaz, and Jamin, and Eker; of whom no other notice is taken;
perhaps they left no children.

[1 Chronicles 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 2:28</span></span>

And the sons of Onam,.... The son of Jerahmeel by his other wife:

were Shammai and Jada. And the sons of Shammai; Nadab, and Abishur;
whose posterity are mentioned in the two following verses.

[1 Chronicles 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 2:29</span></span>

And the name of the wife of Abishur was Abihail,.... Of the same name
was a wife of Rehoboam, a daughter of his grandfather David's eldest
brother, Eliab, [Ch2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#018).

and she bare him Ahban, and Molid; which are no more mentioned, they
perhaps leaving no posterity.

[1 Chronicles 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 2:30</span></span>

And the sons of Nadab,.... The eldest son of Shammai, [Ch1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#028),

Seled and Appaim; but Seled died without children; and therefore we hear
no more of him.

[1 Chronicles 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 2:31</span></span>

And the sons of Appaim; Ishi. And the sons of Ishi: Sheshan,.... Though
they had each of them but one son, yet the plural number is used, their
posterity being included, as in [Ch1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#008) and so in the next clause:

and the children of Sheshan; Ahlai; who, from [Ch1
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#034) appears to be a daughter.

[1 Chronicles 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 2:32</span></span>

And the sons of Jada the brother of Shammai,.... [Ch1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#028),

Jether and Jonathan: and Jether died without children; the posterity of
Jonathan are given the next verse.

[1 Chronicles 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 2:33</span></span>

And the sons of Jonathan; Peleth and Zaza,.... Of whom no mention is
made elsewhere:

these were the sons of Jerahmeel; not only his immediate sons, but their
posterity, called from him Jerahmeelites, [Sa1
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010).

[1 Chronicles 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 2:34</span></span>

Now Sheshan had no sons, but daughters,.... And but one of that sort,
whose name was Ahlai, [Ch1 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#031) the
plural being put here for the singular; or, if that is the name of a
son, as some think, he died in his father's lifetime, and left no issue;
so that there only remained daughters, and it seems but one by the next
verse:

and Sheshan had a servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Jarha; one born
in his house, and brought up by him, and a proselyte, such an one as
Eliezer in Abraham's family.

[1 Chronicles 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 2:35</span></span>

And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife,.... Having
first given him his freedom, as the Targum premises; this daughter seems
to be Ahlai, [Ch1 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#031) which receives
confirmation from Zabad, one of the descendants of this man, [Ch1
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#036), being said to be the son of
Ahlai, [Ch1 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#041), that is,
great-grandson:

and she bare him Attai; the genealogy of whose descendants is given to
the end of [Ch1 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#041), of whom no
mention is made elsewhere, but of Zabad, as before observed; and,
according to the Jews, it is given for the sake of Ishmael, the son of
Nethaniah the son of Elishama, the last person mentioned in this
genealogy; which Ishmael slew Gedaliah governor of Jerusalem, and is
said to be of the seed royal, [Jer
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch1 2:42</span></span>

Now the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel,.... Called Chelubai,
[Ch1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009) and is the same Caleb spoken
of in [Ch1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018) and his sons next
reckoned were by a third wife, Azubah, Ephrath being dead, [Ch1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019) and these sons were

Mesha his firstborn, which was the father of Ziph; who gave name to the
city of Ziph; there were two of this name in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024) or this is the title of Mesha,
governor of the city of Ziph; so the Targum calls him, prince of the
Ziphites:

and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron; according to Kimchi and
Ben Melech, the words are to be supplied thus, "and the sons of Ziph
were Mareshah the father of Hebron"; which, though sometimes the name of
a city in the tribe of Judah, is here the name of a man, from whom,
perhaps, the city had its name, since Hebron is said to have sons in the
next verse; Jarchi makes Mesha to be the prince of Ziph, and prince of
the children of Mareshah, and prince of Hebron.

[1 Chronicles 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">ch1 2:43</span></span>

And the sons of Hebron: Korah, and Tappuah, and Rekem, and Shema. One of
these, Tappuah, is the name of a city in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034) and there is also Bethtappuah in
the same tribe, [Ch1 2:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#053) which one,
or both, might have their name from this man; and Shema also, [Ch1
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#026).

[1 Chronicles 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">ch1 2:44</span></span>

And Shema begat Raham, the father of Jorkoam,.... Which Hillerus (s)
takes to be the name of a city in the tribe of Judah; and Jarchi's note
is, that wherever the word "father" is here used, it is to be understood
of the prince of a city that follows:

and Rekem begat Shammai; there is a descendant of Jerahmeel, the brother
of Caleb, of this name, [Ch1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#028).

\(s\) Onomast. Sacr. p. 329.

[1 Chronicles 2:45](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">ch1 2:45</span></span>

And the son of Shammai was Maon,.... Who gave name to a city in the
tribe of Judah, [Jos 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055) see [Sa1
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#024).

and Maon was the father of Bethzur; prince of a very strong fortified
city of this name in the same tribe, [Jos
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058), unless this was a son of
Maon's, from whom the city had its name.

[1 Chronicles 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">ch1 2:46</span></span>

And Ephah Caleb's concubine bare Haran, and Moza, and Gazez,.... An
half-wife, or secondary wife; for though this man seems not to have had
more wives than one at a time, yet he had concubines with them; we read
of another after this, if not a third:

and Haran begat Gazez; whom he so named after his brother.

[1 Chronicles 2:47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">ch1 2:47</span></span>

And the sons of Jahdai,.... Who is not mentioned by this name before;
perhaps the same with Moza, who might have two names, though, according
to Hillerus (t), he was the son of Moza; some take it to be the name of
another of Caleb's concubines, by whom he had the six following sons:

Regem, and Jotham, and Geshan, and Pelet, and Ephah, and Shaaph; one of
these, Pelet perhaps, gave name to Bethpalet in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#027).

\(t\) Onomast. Sacr. p. 841.

[1 Chronicles 2:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">ch1 2:48</span></span>

Maachah, Caleb's concubine,.... Another concubine of his:

bare Sheber, and Tirhanah; or of whom Caleb begot those two; for the
verb is masculine; so Kimchi.

[1 Chronicles 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">ch1 2:49</span></span>

She bare also Shaaph the father of Madmannah,.... Prince of a place so
called, in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031).

Sheva the father of Machbenah, and the father of Gibeah; prince of two
cities of those names in the same tribe; of the latter see [Jos
15:57](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#057),

and the daughter of Caleb was Achsah; Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, had a
daughter of this name, but neither he nor she are here meant, [Jos
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016) but by whom Caleb, the son of
Hezron, had this daughter, is not said; perhaps by Maachah his concubine
last mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">ch1 2:50</span></span>

These were the sons of Caleb the son of Hur, the firstborn of
Ephratah,.... This is another Caleb, the grandson of Caleb the son of
Hezron, called after his name; he was the son of Hur, the firstborn of
his wife Ephratah, [Ch1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019).

Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim: of the inhabitants of that place;
they sprung from him; or, as the Targum, he was prince of Kirjathjearim,
a city in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#060).

[1 Chronicles 2:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">ch1 2:51</span></span>

Salma the father of Bethlehem,.... Or prince of Bethlehem, as the
Targum; not the same as in [Ch1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#011)
he was the son of Nahshon, this of the younger Caleb:

Hareph, the father of Bethgader; prince of a place of that name called
Gedor, [Ch1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004), and where this man's
name is Penuel; Gedor was in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058).

[1 Chronicles 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">ch1 2:52</span></span>

And Shobal, the father of Kirjathjearim had sons,.... Which shows that
Kirjathjearim is not the name of a man, or of any of Shobal's sons, who
are next mentioned, but of a place of which he was prince: the first is

Haroeh, who is called Reaiah, [Ch1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#002)
a word of the same signification:

and half of the Manahethites; which Kimchi takes to be the proper name
of a man called Chatzihamanaheth, another son of Shobal's; but Jarchi
interprets it of the name of a place or province called Manahath, [Ch1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006) over half of which Haroeh was
governor.

[1 Chronicles 2:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">ch1 2:53</span></span>

And the families of Kirjathjearim,.... That dwelt there, of which Shobal
was prince, and who sprung from him, are as follow:

the Ithrite, and the Puhites, and the Shumathites, and the Mishraites;
who had their names from Jether, Putha, Shumath, and Mishra, descendants
of Shobal:

of them came the Zareathites, and the Eshtaulites; that is, from the
Mishraites sprung the inhabitants of Zeroth and Eshtaol, places in the
tribe of Judah, [Jos 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033).

[1 Chronicles 2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">ch1 2:54</span></span>

The sons of Salma,.... Another son of the younger Caleb, [Ch1
2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050) whose sons were Bethlehem, the
inhabitants of the place, at least many of them, of which he was prince,
[Ch1 2:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#051) and the Netophathite; the
inhabitants of Netophah, a place in the tribe of Judah, mentioned along
with Bethlehem, [Neh 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#026) these sprung
from Salma:

Ataroth, the house of Joab; Ataroth seems to be the name of a place in
the tribe of Judah, where the family of Joab lived, the inhabitants of
which were the descendants of Salma:

and half of the Manahethites; the other half of the inhabitants of
Manahath, see [Ch1 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052),

the Zorites; part also of them, called Zareathites, [Ch1
2:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#053).

[1 Chronicles 2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">ch1 2:55</span></span>

And the families of the scribes which dwelt at Jabez,.... A city in
Judah, the founder of which, perhaps, was Jabez, mentioned in [Ch1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009) in which learned men dwelt:

the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites; who sprung from men
whose names were Tira, Shimea, and Sucha; and if they were not the
posterity of Salma, yet dwelt among his, and so are reckoned with them;
perhaps the latter might have their name from dwelling in tents; the
former clause may be rendered, "that dwelt with Jabez", who was their
master, and they his scholars; in the Vulgate Latin version the words
are rendered as appellatives, "singing and resounding, and dwelling in
tents": Conrad Pellican, on the place, goes a middle way, and interprets
these families as dwelling with Jabez their master, and they his
scholars, and that they were called by their progenitors Tirathites,
because learned and ingenious, and praecentors of the divine oracles;
Shimeathites, because they diligently hearkened to the sacred songs, and
the doctrines of the law of God; and Suchathites, because they dwelt not
in cities, but in tents, despisers of all worldly things, that they
might freely attend to learn:

these are the Kenites; that is, the Suchathites are the Kenites, who, it
is well known, dwelt in tents, and not in cities; though Jarchi takes
these Kenites to be the inhabitants of Cain, a city in the tribe of
Judah, [Jos 15:57](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#057) but they seem rather
to be the Kenites that sprung from Jethro, here made mention of, because
some of them dwelt in the tribe of Judah, and among the posterity of
Salma, see [Jdg 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016).

that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab; the prince of
that family, and who from Rechab were called Rechabites, [Jer
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#002).
