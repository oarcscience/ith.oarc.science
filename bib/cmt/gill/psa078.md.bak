[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 78:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 78

Maschil of Asaph. Or for "Asaph" (f); a doctrinal and "instructive"
psalm, as the word "Maschil" signifies; see [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), which was delivered to Asaph to
be sung; the Targum is,

"the understanding of the Holy Spirit by the hands of Asaph.''

Some think David was the penman of it; but from the latter part of it,
in which mention is made of him, and of his government of the people of
Israel, it looks as if it was wrote by another, and after his death,
though not long after, since the account is carried on no further than
his times; and therefore it is probable enough it was written by Asaph,
the chief singer, that lived in that age: whoever was the penman of it,
it is certain he was a prophet, and so was Asaph, who is called a seer,
the same with a prophet, and who is said to prophesy, [Ch2
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030.md) and also that he represented
Christ; for that the Messiah is the person that is introduced speaking
in this psalm is clear from [Mat 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#034.md)
and the whole may be considered as a discourse of his to the Jews of his
time; giving them an history of the Israelites from their first coming
out of Egypt to the times of David, and in it an account of the various
benefits bestowed upon them, of their great ingratitude, and of the
divine resentment; the design of which is to admonish and caution them
against committing the like sins, lest they should be rejected of God,
as their fathers were, and perish: some Jewish writers, as Arama
observes, interpret this psalm of the children of Ephraim going out of
Egypt before the time appointed.

[Psalms 78:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 78:1</span></span>

Give ear, O my people,.... The Jews were Christ's people, he descending
from their fathers according to the flesh; they were his own, to whom he
came, though rejected by them; they were his nation and people that
delivered him up into the hands of the Romans; see [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md) thus it is usual with persons to
call those, who are of the same nation with them, their people, [Est
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#003.md) and especially for kings to call
their subjects so; see [Ch1 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md), and
such was Christ; he was King of the Jews, though they would not have him
reign over them; and therefore he here speaks as one having royal
authority, and requires attention to him, and obedience to his word,
which he calls his law:

to my law; meaning neither the moral nor the ceremonial law, but the
doctrine of the Gospel, or law of faith, called the Messiah's law, [Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md). This is the doctrine which he as
man received of his Father, and which he taught and delivered to his
disciples, and which concerns himself, his person, office, and grace,
and is sometimes called the doctrine of Christ, [Jo2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#009.md),

incline your ears to the words of my mouth; the several doctrines of the
everlasting Gospel preached by him, which were words of wisdom and of
grace, of righteousness and eternal life, of peace, pardon, and
everlasting salvation: these ought to be heard and diligently attended
to; the matter contained in them requires attention; the office Christ
bears demands it of men; all that have ears to hear should hear; all
Christ's sheep do hear his voice, understand it, and act according to
it: hear ye him was the instruction of Moses, and the direction of
Christ's heavenly Father, [Deu 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md),
and great is the danger such incur who hear him not, but neglect and
despise his word, [Heb 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 78:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 78:2</span></span>

I will open my mouth,.... Speak freely, boldly, and without reserve,
[Eph 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md), so Christ opened his mouth,
[Mat 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#002.md),

in a parable; not that what follows in this psalm was such, but what
were delivered by our Lord in the days of his flesh, who spake many
parables; as of the sower, and of tares, and of the grain of mustard
seed, and many others, and without a parable he spake not, and so
fulfilled what he here said he would do, [Mat
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#034.md).

I will utter dark sayings of old; sayings that relate to things of old;
meaning not to the coming of the children of Israel out of Egypt, and
what follows in the psalm, delivered, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi observe,
in figurative and topical terms, as in [Psa
78:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#019.md), but to the things which were
from the foundation of the world, as the phrase is rendered in [Mat
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#035.md), spoken of Christ in his
ministry, such as the fall of the angels, the ruin of man by Satan, the
murder of Abel, Abraham's sight of his day with joy, and many things
that were said by them of old, [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md) or rather this refers to the
Gospel, and the sayings and doctrines of it, which were kept secret
since the world began, [Mat 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003.md), yea,
which were ordained before the world was, and therefore called the
everlasting Gospel, [Co1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md) and here
in the Arabic version, "eternal mysteries"; such as concerning the
everlasting love of God to his people, his everlasting choice of them,
and everlasting covenant with them: and the sayings or doctrines of the
Gospel may he called "dark", because secret, hidden, and mysterious; and
were so under the legal dispensation, in comparison of the more clear
light under the Gospel dispensation; they having been wrapped up in
types and shadows, and in the rites and ceremonies of the law, but now
held forth clearly and plainly in the ministry of Christ and his
apostles, as in a glass: these Christ says he would "utter" or deliver
out as water from a fountain, in great plenty, as he did; he came in the
fulness of the blessing of the Gospel; and being full of grace and
truth, the doctrines of grace and truth, these came by him, and were
delivered from him in all their fulness and glory.

[Psalms 78:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 78:3</span></span>

Which we have heard and known,.... The change of number from "I" to "we"
have made some think that the disciples of Christ are here introduced
speaking; but there is no need to suppose that, since our Lord uses the
same form of speech, [Joh 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011.md),

and our fathers have told us; this may not only regard the Jewish
ancestors, from whom our Lord descended according to the flesh, and so
refer to the following account of the wonderful things done for the
people of Israel; but also the divine Father of Christ, from whom, as
his only begotten Son that lay in his bosom, and as Mediator, and the
Angel of the great council, he heard and became acquainted with the
secrets and mysteries of grace, and with his Father's mind and will; all
which he declared and made known to his apostles, and in so doing used
them as his friends, [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md) and so
the apostles of Christ, what they had from him their everlasting Father,
and who had used to call them his children, even what they had seen, and
heard, and learned, they made known to others, [Act
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 78:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 78:4</span></span>

We will not hide them from their children,.... The children of the
Jewish fathers, but faithfully publish and declare them, as Christ and
his apostles did; or the children of God and Christ, their spiritual
seed and offspring:

showing to the generation to come; and so in all successive ages, by the
ministration of the word, and the Spirit attending it; see [Psa
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030.md),

the praises of the Lord; what he has done in predestination, redemption,
and effectual calling, which is to the praise of the glory of his grace,
[Eph 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md), and so all other truths of
the Gospel, which are to the praise of Father, Son, and Spirit, and
engage men to show it forth:

and his strength displayed; in Christ, the man of his right hand, made
strong for himself, and in the redemption wrought out by him, as well as
in the conversion of sinners by his mighty grace, and in the
preservation of them by his power:

and his wonderful works that he hath done; in providence and grace; the
miracles wrought by Christ, which were the wonderful works given him to
finish, as proofs of his deity and Messiahship, and are testified in the
Gospel for the confirmation of it; and especially the wonders of
redeeming love, and calling grace, which are peculiarly to be ascribed
unto him as the works his hands have wrought, and the wonderful decrees
of God he made in eternity concerning these things.

[Psalms 78:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 78:5</span></span>

For he established a testimony in Jacob,.... So the law is called, being
a testification of the divine will, [Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016.md) and the Scriptures, the writings
of the Old Testament, which testify of Christ, his person, office,
sufferings, and death, [Isa 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md) and
particularly the Gospel, which is the testimony of God, of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and of his apostles, [Ti2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008.md) which bears witness to the love
and grace of God in the salvation of men by Christ; to the dignity of
Christ's person, to the fulness of his grace, to each of the offices and
relations he bears and stands in to his people; to the virtue of his
obedience, sufferings, and death; to redemption, righteousness, peace
and pardon by him: this is established in the house of Jacob, as the
Targum; in the church, which is the pillar and ground of truth, among
the saints and people of God, to whom it is delivered, and by whom it
will be kept, and with whom it will remain throughout all ages; for it
is the everlasting Gospel:

and appointed a law in Israel; the law given on Mount Sinai was peculiar
to them, and so were the word and oracles, they were committed to them;
and not only the writings of Moses, but the prophets, are called the
law, [Joh 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034.md), but the Gospel seems
to be here meant; see Gill on [Psa
78:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#001.md), this was ordained before the
world for our glory, and is put and placed in the hands and hearts of
the faithful ministers of it, and is published among, and received by,
the true Israel of God:

which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their
children; that is, the testimony and the law, and the things contained
in them; the Jewish fathers were frequently commanded to teach their
children the law of Moses, [Deu 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009.md)
and it was their practice to instruct them in the knowledge of the
Scriptures, [Ti2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015.md), and it becomes
Christian parents to bring up their children in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord, by making known to them the principles of the
Christian religion, and the truths of the Gospel, [Eph
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 78:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 78:6</span></span>

That the generation to come might know them,.... Not only notionally,
but spiritually and experimentally; which is the case, when human
teachings are attended with the spirit of wisdom and revertion in the
knowledge of divine truths; for the truths of the Gospel are unknown to
men; the Gospel is hidden wisdom, the wisdom of God in a mystery; the
Bible is a sealed book, the doctrines of it are riddles and dark
sayings; the ministry of the word is the means of knowledge, which
become effectual when attended with the Spirit and power of God:

even the children which should be born, who should arise and declare
them to their children; and so be transmitted from age to age: it is the
will of God, that, besides private instructions, there should be a
standing ministry kept up in all ages, to the end of the world; and he
will have some that shall receive the Gospel, and profess his name;
there has been and will be a succession of regenerate persons; instead
of the fathers come up the children, a seed to serve the Lord, accounted
to him for a generation; the seed and the seed's seed of the church,
from whose mouth the word of God shall never depart; but they shall
declare it one to another, by which means it shall be continued to the
latest posterity, [Psa 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030.md).

[Psalms 78:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 78:7</span></span>

That they might set their hope in God,.... And not in the creature, nor
in any creature enjoyment; see [Job
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024.md), the Lord is the only proper
object of hope and confidence; Christ, who is truly God, is the hope of
his people, and in him they place it, as they have great reason to do;
since with him there is mercy, the mercy of God is proclaimed in him;
and with him there is redemption, which includes the blessings of peace,
pardon, and righteousness; and a plenteous one, a redemption from all
sin; and it is the Gospel which points out these things in Christ, and
encourages a firm and settled hope and trust in him: and this shows that
that is meant by the law and testimony; since the law of Moses gives no
encouragement to hope in God; it convinces of sin, but does not direct
to a Saviour, and so leaves without hope; it works wrath, terror, and
despair; it is in the Gospel only Christ is set before men, as the
object of hope to lay hold on, and which is as an anchor sure and
steadfast, where they may securely place it:

and not forget the works of God; which the Gospel declares; not only the
miracles of Christ recorded by the evangelists, but the works of grace,
redemption, and salvation; the remembrance of which is kept up by the
ministry of the word, and the administration of ordinances:

but keep his commandments; the commandments of Christ, and which are
peculiar to the Gospel dispensation; and are to be kept in faith, from a
principle of love, through the grace and strength of Christ, and to the
glory of God by him; see [Joh 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015.md).

[Psalms 78:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 78:8</span></span>

And might not be as their fathers,.... This chiefly respects the Jews in
Christ's time: though it also is an admonition to them in succeeding
ages, and especially in the latter day, when they shall be instructed,
called, and converted; and even to us, to whom the Gospel is preached,
on whom the ends of the world are come, not to be disobedient, as the
Jewish fathers were, and to take care we do not fall after the same
example of unbelief; this opens the whole scope and general design of
the psalm; see [Co1 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006.md),

a stubborn and rebellions generation; as the generation in the
wilderness was, [Deu 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#006.md) and so were
their posterity in Christ's time, [Mat
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034.md),

a generation that set not their heart aright; to seek the Lord, serve
and obey him; their hearts were removed far from him, and they were
hypocritical in their prayers to him, and service of him:

and whose spirit was not steadfast with God; did not continue in the
faith of God, in the true religion, but departed and apostatized from
him; see [Psa 78:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#037.md). Apostasy is
generally the fruit and effect of hypocrisy; all the following facts
support the character which is here given of them.

[Psalms 78:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 78:9</span></span>

The children of Ephraim being armed, and carrying bows,.... Or "casting"
arrows out of the "bow" (a); they went out well armed to meet the enemy,
and they trusted in their armour, and not in the Lord; and being skilful
in throwing darts, or shooting arrows, promised themselves victory:

but turned back in the day of battle; fled from the enemy, could not
stand their ground when the onset was made: what this refers to is not
easy to determine; some think this with what follows respects the
defection of the ten tribes in Rehoboam's time, which frequently go
under the name of Ephraim; but we have no account of any battle then
fought, and lost by them; and besides the history of this psalm reaches
no further than the times of David; others are of opinion that it
regards the time of Eli, when the Israelites were beaten by the
Philistines, the ark of God was taken, Eli's two sons slain, and thirty
thousand more, [Sa1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001.md). Ephraim being
put for the rest of the tribes, the ark being in that tribe; others
suppose that the affair between the Gileadites and Ephraimites, in the
times of Jephthah, is referred to, when there fell of the Ephraimites
forty and two thousand, [Jdg 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md),
many of the Jewish (b) writers take it to be the history of a fact that
was done in Egypt before the children of Israel came out from thence;
see [Ch1 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md), so the Targum,

"when they dwelt in Egypt, the children of Ephraim grew proud, they
appointed the end (or term of going out of Egypt), and they erred, and
went out thirty years before the end, with warlike arms, and mighty men
carrying bows, turned back, and were slain in the day of battle;''

though it seems most likely to have respect to what was done in the
wilderness, as Kimchi observes, after they were come out of Egypt, and
had seen the wonders of God there, and at the Red sea, and in the
wilderness; and perhaps reference is had to the discomfiture of the
Israelites by the Amalekites, when they went up the hill they were
forbid to do, and in which, it may be, the Ephraimites were most
forward, and suffered most; see [Num
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#040.md).

[Psalms 78:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 78:10</span></span>

They kept not the covenant of God,.... Either the covenant of
circumcision, which was neglected during their travels through the
wilderness, [Jos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#005.md) or the covenant
made with the people of Israel at Mount Sinai, [Exo
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007.md) and this is to be understood not
of the children of Ephraim only, but of the Israelites in general, who
in many instances broke the covenant, and were not steadfast in it, [Psa
78:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#037.md); see Gill on [Jer
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032.md).

and refused to walk in his law; the law of God, which was given forth by
him, by the disposition of angels, through the hands of a mediator,
Moses, as a rule of their walk and conversation; but they refused to
order their conversation according to it, being unwilling to be subject
to it, but despised and cast it away; a sad instance of the corruption
of human nature, and the depravity of man's will, boasted of for its
freedom, yet what is common, and to be observed in all mankind.

[Psalms 78:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 78:11</span></span>

And forgat his works, and his wonders,.... That is, his wonderful works,
the miracles he wrought in their favour, and for their deliverance,
afterwards particularly mentioned; these were not only forgotten in the
next generation, [Jdg 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#010.md), but in a
few years, yea, in a few months, nay, in a few days, when they had been
but three days' journey in the wilderness, after their passage through
the Red sea, see [Exo 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md), which
occasioned the observation of the psalmist, [Psa
106:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#012.md), that he had showed them; done
in their sight, and in the sight of their fathers, as follows.

[Psalms 78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 78:12</span></span>

Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers,.... The Targum
is,

"before Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes of their fathers, he
did marvellous things;''

but these were dead before this time; the Jews have a fancy, that these
were brought to the sea, and placed upon it; and the Lord showed them
what he would do for their children, and how he would redeem them; but
this is to be understood of the plagues which were brought upon the
Egyptians, and which are called wonders, [Exo
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#010.md), and were so to the Egyptians
themselves; and these were done by the hands of Moses and Aaron, and in
their sight:

in the land of Egypt; where the Israelites were in bondage, and while
they were there, and on their account were these things done:

in the field of Zoan; that is, in the territory of Zoan, which was an
ancient city of Egypt, [Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md), the
metropolis of the land where Pharaoh kept his court; hence we read of
the princes of Zoan, [Isa 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md), it is
the same with Tanis, and so it is called here in the Septuagint and
Vulgate Latin versions, and also in the Targum; it is said to have been
two miles from Heliopolis, and one from Memphis; and at this day these
three cities are become one, which is fifteen miles in compass, and goes
by the name of Alcair. In this great city, the metropolis of the nation,
before Pharaoh and all his court, were the above wonders done.

[Psalms 78:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 78:13</span></span>

He divided the sea,.... The Targum adds,

"by the rod of Moses their master;''

which he was ordered to lift up, and to stretch out his hand over the
sea; which he did, and at the same time a strong east wind was raised,
which caused the sea to go back, and divided the waters of it; see [Exo
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#016.md).

and caused them to pass through; that is, he caused the Israelites to
pass through the sea; this they did in faith, [Heb
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#029.md), in the faith of the power and
promise of God, and of future grace and blessings, which this was an
emblem of; for it was a representation of baptism, and is so called,
[Co1 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md) and of the sea of Christ's
blood, or of his sufferings and death; whereby all enemies are overcome
and destroyed, as sin and Satan, signified by the Egyptians, and
salvation is wrought, and every blessing of grace procured; and of the
passage of God's people through the sea of this world, and afflictions
in it, safe to glory:

and he made the waters to stand as an heap; and were as a wall on the
right hand and on the left hand so they continued until the Israelites
had passed through; and then they returned, and covered the Egyptians,
and drowned them, [Exo 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#022.md).

[Psalms 78:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 78:14</span></span>

In the daytime also he led them with a cloud,.... Which was in the form
of a pillar, and went before them, and the Lord in it, and directed
their way, and protected them from heat; see [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md), [Neh
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#012.md) this was typical of Christ, who
is a shadow and security from the heat of a fiery law, the flaming sword
of justice, the wrath of God, which is poured forth like fire, the fiery
darts of Satan, and from hurt by any enemy whatever; see [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md), and who leads his people through
the wilderness of this world by his Spirit, by his word, and by his own
example; and who is the best and safest guide to follow:

and all the night with a light of fire; which also was in the form of a
pillar, and went before them, and gave light in the night, and the Lord
was in it; and this also was typical of Christ, who is the light of his
people amidst all their darkness in this world.

[Psalms 78:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 78:15</span></span>

He clave the rocks in the wilderness,.... The one at Rephidim, [Exo
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md), and the other at Kadesh, [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md) both to be seen at this day; See

traveller makes mention but one, yet Jerom (b) from Eusebius affirms
that it was shown in his day: they were typical of Christ, [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md), who is frequently compared to
one for height, strength, and duration, shade, shelter, and protection;
and is called the Rock of Israel, the Rock of offence to both houses of
Israel, the Rock of salvation, the Rock of refuge, the Rock of strength,
the Rock that is higher than the saints, and on which the church is
built, and who is the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. The
cleaving of the rocks is ascribed to God, which was done by the hands of
Moses; and so the Targum adds,

"by the rod of Moses their master;''

but Moses was only the instrument, it was the Lord that did it; Moses
with his rod could never have done it, had not the power of God went
along with it. This smiting and cleaving the rocks were an emblem of the
sufferings of Christ, who was smitten of God with the rod of justice,
according to the law of Moses, in a judicial way, for the sins of his
people, and in order to obtain salvation for them:

and gave them drink as out of the great depths; such a large quantity of
water flowed out of the rocks when smitten, as if it came out of the
great sea, which furnished them with drink sufficient, and more than
enough for them and their cattle; this was typical of the large
abundance of grace, and the blessings of it, which flow freely and
plentifully from Christ and his fulness, and through his sufferings and
death.

He brought streams also out of the rock,.... Which is expressed in the
singular number, as also in [Psa
78:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#020.md), because the children of Israel
were not come to Kadesh, and the second rock was not smitten when they
lusted after flesh, and murmured against God, and tempted him, as is
after related:

and caused waters to run down like rivers; from the descent of the rock,
which followed them all the way in the wilderness; this was a most
marvellous thing, that water should flow from a flinty rock upon
striking it, from whence fire rather than water might have been
expected; and that it should flow in such great abundance, and that from
a rock in a wilderness.

And they sinned yet more against him,.... Or, "and they added yet to sin
against him" (c); which was great ingratitude; they had sinned before,
and it might have been hoped that the goodness of God to them would have
engaged them to have sinned no more, at least at such a rate, and in
such a manner, as they had done; but instead of sinning less, they
sinned more and more, they added sin to sin; such is the corrupt heart
of man, notwithstanding the grace of God, and the blessings of it
vouchsafed unto him:

by provoking the most High in the wilderness; everything is aggravating;
the object against whom they sinned was the most High, which betrays
their impiety, folly, and vanity; and they did not slightly sin against
him, but did those things which were highly provoking and exasperating;
and that in the wilderness, where they received so many favours, and
where they must have been starved and perish, and could not have lived,
without immediate provision, support, and protection, from the hand of
the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 78:18</span></span>

And they tempted God in their heart,.... Which is desperately wicked,
and from whence all impiety flows; they entertained hard thoughts of
God; they inwardly fretted at their present circumstances, and secretly
repined and murmured against God, and wished for things they should not;
not being contented with what they had, and thankful for them, as they
ought to have been:

by asking meat for their lust; or, "for their soul"; such as their souls
lusted after, and their sensitive appetites craved; for they were not
satisfied with the bread they had, which was sufficient for their
sustenance and support; they wanted food for pleasure and wantonness; to
ask for daily bread is right, but to ask for more to consume on our
lusts is wrong, [Jam 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 78:19</span></span>

Yea, they spoke against God,.... Not only thought ill of him, and
tempted him in their hearts, but they expressed with their mouths what
was in their hearts, and spoke against him, his power, and his
providence, in plain words, though he had been so good and gracious to
them, and had done such wonderful things for them: they said,

can God furnish a table in the wilderness? these are the words which
they spoke against him, and by which they tempted him, questioning his
power and his goodness, and expressing their dissatisfaction with their
present and daily allowance; they were not content with the manna they
had every day, but they wanted to have a table ordered and spread with
all kind of dainties. The sense of the question is, can the Lord do this
for us? give us a plentiful table in the wilderness, as well as drop the
manna about our tents? if he can, why does not he? if he does not, it
must be either for want in himself, or want of good will to us; and thus
tried and tempted the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 78:20</span></span>

Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
overflowed,.... This they allow was done by him, for these are their
words continued; suggesting, that though the waters did gush out upon
smiting the rock, yet they might have been in the caverns of it before,
and had remained there a long time, and might have come out of
themselves; and therefore this was no such great matter, and might
easily be accounted for:

but can he give bread also? solid, substantial bread, and not like this
light bread, the manna, as they called it, [Num
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005.md), can he give us bread of corn, in
a wilderness which is not a place of seed, where no corn grows? can he
do this? this would show his power indeed:

can he provide flesh for his people? for so great a multitude, and in a
place where no cattle are? let him do this, and we will believe his
power; or else the words intimate that the smiting of the rock, and the
waters flowing in such large streams, were an instance of his power, and
therefore he that could do the one could do the other; he that could
bring such large quantities of water out of a rock could give them solid
bread and suitable flesh, and fulness of both; and should he not do so,
they must conclude that he bore no good will to them, and had no love
and kindness for them.

[Psalms 78:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 78:21</span></span>

Therefore the Lord heard this,.... What they said in their hearts, and
what they expressed with their mouths, all their murmurings against him,
their distrust of his power and providence, and disbelief of his
promises; see [Num 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001.md), and was
wroth; exceeding wroth; he was highly displeased; there was an overflow
of his indignation, as the word (a) signifies; it was running upon him,
upon the thick bosses of his buckler, to arraign his perfections, call
in question any of his attributes, and disbelieve his word; this must
greatly exasperate him, and provoke the eyes of his glory:

so a fire was kindled against Jacob; the posterity of Jacob; or in Jacob
(b), in the camp of Israel; which was literally true, because of the
murmurings of the people against the Lord fire came down from heaven,
and burnt among them, and consumed the uttermost parts of the camp;
wherefore the name of the place was called Taberah, which signifies a
burning, [Num 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001.md), or it may be taken
figuratively for the wrath of God, which is oftentimes compared to fire;
see [Nah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006.md) hence it follows,

and anger also came up against Israel; the people of Israel, the same
with Jacob before; the allusion is to men when angry, in whose breasts
anger burns, and from thence it rises up, and shows itself in their
countenance, in their eyes, and by the words of their mouth.

Because they believed not in God,.... That he was able to give them
bread, and provide flesh for them, or bring them through the wilderness
to Canaan's land, as he had promised. God, and he only, is the object of
faith, and he is to be believed in at all times, and for all things
temporal and spiritual; and nothing is more displeasing to him than
unbelief; for as faith gives glory to him, unbelief reflects dishonour
upon him; faith sets its seal to him as true, but unbelief makes him a
liar; and what is more provoking to man than to have his veracity called
in question, and to be counted a liar? in short, as faith has salvation
annexed to it, unbelief has damnation, and to whom did the Lord swear
that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not?
so great an evil is unbelief, and is the sin which "easily beset" (c)
the Israelites, as appears from the context; see [Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012.md).

and trusted not in his salvation; which he promised them, and bid them
stand still and see, [Exo 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013.md), and
of which they had had some proofs and instances in leading them through
the Red sea, and thus far guiding them through the wilderness, and
providing for them; and therefore had reason and encouragement to trust
in the Lord, that he would yet be with them, and save them, and complete
the mercy promised unto them.

Though he had commanded the clouds from above,.... Which were round
about him, his chariots, and the dust of his feet; and which were at his
command to go here and there, and carry and let down provisions for his
people, as they did:

and opened the doors of heaven; as a large granary, from whence the
manna, afterwards called the corn of heaven, was given out in great
abundance, which is signified by opening the doors; see [Mal

And had rained down manna upon them to eat,.... So called, either from
"manah", which signifies to prepare, appoint, and distribute, because
this was food prepared of God for the Israelites without them, and was
their provision, their appointed portion, and which was daily
distributed to them in measure; or from the words , "man hu", what is
it? which they used at first sight of the manna, they not knowing what
it was, and hence called it "man"; or "manna"; this the Lord rained down
from heaven, as he promised he would, that they might have food to eat;
see [Exo 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#004.md).

and had given them of the corn of heaven; bread corn springs out of the
earth, but this was corn from heaven, very unusual and wonderful; this
greatly aggravated the unbelief of the Israelites, and shows their great
ingratitude, that after all this they should disbelieve the Lord, and
not trust in his salvation; the manna was a type of Christ, who is
called the hidden manna, [Co1 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003.md);

Man did eat angels' food,.... Or, "the bread of the mighty" (d); such as
Moses and Elijah ate of; so Arama; but Aben Ezra and Kimchi interpret it
of the clouds, or skies, said to be strong, [Job
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md) in which the manna was prepared,
and let down: but rather the words may be read, "every man did eat the
bread of the mighty ones"; of princes and nobles, and the great men of
the earth; it was royal food, it was princely fare; and, indeed, the
common people of Israel ate the same as their princes and nobles did;
they all fared alike; but the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and all the
Oriental versions, render the word "angels", and so Jarchi interprets
it, and who are called mighty angels, and are creatures that excel in
strength, [Th2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md) now the manna may
be said to be their food, as it is in the Apocrypha:

"Instead whereof thou feddest thine own people with angels' food, and
didst send them from heaven bread prepared without their labour, able to
content every man's delight, and agreeing to every taste.'' (Wisdom
16:20)

because it might be prepared in the air by the ministry of angels, and
given by their disposition, as the law was, [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md) or because it came down from
heaven, where they dwell, and so the Targum,

"the children of men did eat food, which came down from the habitation
of angels;''

or because it was most excellent food, as the tongue of angels is the
most excellent and eloquent, [Co1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001.md), or because it was such food,
that, if angels ate any, it was fit for them, and not at all unworthy of
them. Cocceius thinks, and so Gussetius (e), that by the mighty ones are
meant the mighty God, Father, Son, and Spirit, by whom this food was
prepared and given; so the word is used in the singular number, of
Jehovah, who is called the mighty One of Jacob, [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md) and of the Redeemer, [Isa
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026.md),

he sent them meat to the full; which may be understood either of the
manna, of which they had great plenty, so that there was no lack for any
man, and this continued with them till they came to the land of Canaan;
or of the quails, of which in the following verses.

He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens,.... In the airy heaven:
or "he caused it to go" (f); to go forth out of its place, out of the
repositories and treasures of it, from whence he brings the wind, [Psa
130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007.md) the winds are under the power
and government of God, they are his servants that obey him; he says to
one, Go, and it goes; and to another, Come, and it comes; stormy wind
fulfils his word of command, and obeys its Creator:

and by his power he brought in the south wind; into the heavens, into
the air, as before, and with it he brought the quails; and which made
his power to appear the greater, since they do not fly with the south
wind, which is too moist and heavy for them, as naturalists observe (g);
it looks as if first one wind blew, and then another was used for the
bringing of them from the place where they were; perhaps about the Red
sea, where they are said to have been in great numbers; and that the
east wind brought them to a certain point, and then the south wind blew
to bring them into the camp of Israel, where, by the moistness of it,
they fell; hence fowlers, as the above naturalists relate, observe the
south wind, in order to take them; though it may be that only one wind
is intended, namely, the southeast wind; and so Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and
Ben Melech, understand it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 78:27</span></span>

He rained flesh also upon them as dust,.... By "flesh" is meant fowl, as
the following clause shows; for there is flesh of birds, as well as of
other creatures, see [Co1 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#039.md) and
the quails which are here meant may be very fitly called flesh, since
they are, for their size, a very plump, fat, and fleshy bird:

and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea; or "fowl of wing" (h):
winged fowls, so the Targum; fowl that flies; and therefore it was the
more remarkable that these should be rained and fall, and be taken by
the Israelites; and which fell in great numbers, as is signified by
these phrases, the dust and the sand of the sea; for there fell enough
to feed six hundred thousand men, beside women and children, for a month
together; they lay in heaps, two cubits high, on one another, and
everyone that gathered them brought in ten homers; see [Num
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#019.md), which is the history referred
to; and quails are used to fly together in large bodies; and sometimes,
as Pliny (i) relates, will light on ships at sea, and sink them with
their numbers. Some think one sort of locusts is meant, which were used
for food, and was very delicious food; and the circumstances of bringing
them with an east or southeast wind, their falling in heaps, and being
gathered in bushels, and spread about to be dried in the sun, seem to
favour such a sense; See Gill on [Num
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#019.md); see Gill on [Num
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#020.md); see Gill on [Num

11:31](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#031.md); see Gill on [Num
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#032.md). The ancients interpret this
mystically of the flesh of Christ, whose flesh is meat indeed, delicious
food for faith, as the quails were a rich food; and as they were rained
down from heaven, so Christ is the bread of life which came down from
heaven, and the bread he gave for the life of the world was his flesh:
and as these came up, however the first quails, in the evening, [Exo
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#013.md), so Christ came in the flesh, in
the evening or end of the world, to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself; to which may be added, that these creatures sit upon their
young, and cherish and protect them, as an hen her chickens (k) with
which compare [Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md), but seeing
the quails are never called spiritual meat, as the manna is, [Co1
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003.md), but were given in wrath and
judgment, they are rather an emblem of riches, or worldly goods, things
given to carnal men; these are of God, as the quails were, and are by
some persons enjoyed without care or trouble, as these were; their meat,
as it is sometimes said, falls into their mouth, as these quails did
into the mouths of the Israelites, as it were; and are in wrath, their
blessings are cursed to them, and, while they have a great affluence of
worldly things, have leanness in their souls, as the Israelites now had,
[Psa 106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015.md), moreover, as these were
feathered or winged fowl, so riches have wings, and sometimes flee away,
and are very uncertain things to trust to, [Pro

And he let it fall in the midst of their camp,.... Or, "his camps" (l);
the four camps of Israel; for so many there were, [Num
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001.md) or the camp of God, where he
dwelt, and before which he went as the General, Leader, and Commander of
them; in the midst of this, or by it, by the side of it, [Num
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#031.md), the flesh or feathered fowl
fell, so that they had no trouble to fetch it in; and here it fell by
the order and direction of the Lord himself; he caused it to fall,
without whose knowledge and will a sparrow does not fall to the ground,
[Mat 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029.md). These creatures fell
either, as some think, being wearied with their flight over the Red sea;
or through their wings being broken by the vehemency of the wind that
brought them, as others; or by the moistness of the south wind, which
wetted their wings, and made them flag and fall; but, by whatever means
this was done, it was so ordered by the Lord that they should fall, and
fall just in the place where they did:

round about their habitations; for the space of a day's journey on every
side, where they lay in heaps, here and there, two cubits high, [Num
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#031.md), so that they could gather them
with great ease, and had no need of arrows to shoot at them, nor nets to
spread for them; they were ready at hand, and in great plenty.

So they did eat, and were well filled,..... Or "exceedingly filled" (m),
or too much, as some versions render it; they eat to excess, not merely
to satisfy nature, but to gratify their sensual appetite: gluttony is a
sin; it is an abuse of the creatures; it hurts the body by filling it
with gross humours, and bringing diseases on it; it is injurious to the
mind; the heart may be overcharged by it; it disposes it to sin; it
leads to impiety, to atheism, and disbelief of a future state, which
often go along with it, and ends in destruction, which is the case of
those whose god is their belly:

for he gave them their own desire; or their lust (n), what they lusted
after, flesh; and they had as much of it as they would, though this was
given in judgment; and a sad thing it is when God gives men a fulness of
this world's things, and leaves them to the abuse of them, or sends
leanness into their souls, and gives them up to their own hearts' lusts.

They were not estranged from their lust,.... By the goodness and
liberality of God unto them, they were not brought to repentance for
their sin of lusting; nor did they abstain from their fleshly lusts, or
deny themselves of them, which the grace of God teaches to do; or else
the sense is, what they lusted after, flesh, was not withheld from them,
or they restrained from eating it; they were indulged with it for a
whole month together; to which agrees what follows:

but while their meat was yet in their mouths; the meat of the quails,
while it was between their teeth, ere it was chewed, and before it was
swallowed down, while they were rolling this sweet morsel under their
tongues, and were gorging themselves with it, destruction came upon
them, as follows; just as Belshazzar, while he was feasting with his

or the words may be rendered, "and slew them among their fatness", or
"fat things" (o); while they were feeding on their feast of fat things,
the fat quails, which were brought among them, in such plenty; for the
quail is a very fat bird, as Kimchi observes (p):

and smote down the chosen men of Israel; or the young men, as the
Targum, who were within the twentieth and fiftieth year of their age;
who were chosen and fit for war within that time, as well as were the
choicest for comeliness, strength, and service; or "made" them "to bow"
(q) to death and the grave; whose power they could not withstand, though
in the prime and vigour of youth, and while they were freely and
heartily feeding upon the food they lusted after.

[Psalms 78:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 78:32</span></span>

For all this they sinned still,.... Those that survived, not being
brought to repentance by mercies, nor by judgments; not by mercies, such
as before mentioned, though they were great and many, and some of them
continued, and of which they were very unworthy; the goodness of God
should, but it does not always, lead persons to repentance; mercies,
unless they are sanctified, often prove snares and temptations to sin
yet more and more; nothing short of the grace of God will bring persons
to repentance for sin, or keep them from it: nor by judgments, which
were last mentioned, and seem chiefly designed; these have no more
effect than the other, unless the power of divine grace goes along with
them; see [Amo 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006.md) it could not be
thought, nor was it expected, that they should, after all these mercies
and judgments, have lived without sin, which no man does, or can do; but
then they went on in a course of sin, and were continually repeating
their transgressions, and were guilty of sins of a very heinous nature,
many of which are on record; as Aaron and Miriam, by speaking against
Moses, the faithful servant of the Lord, which brought upon the latter
the plague of leprosy; the spies which were sent to search the land, and
brought an evil report of it, which set the people a murmuring, and put
them on thoughts of returning to Egypt; those that were concerned in the
business of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, who were swallowed up in the
earth, or burnt with fire from heaven; the whole congregation which
murmured at Kadesh, whom Moses called rebels, and who afterwards
expressed their loathing of the manna, for which fiery serpents were
sent among them, [Num 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md), [Num
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#002.md) but their prevailing sin was
unbelief, as follows:

and believed not for his wondrous works: not "in" them, though the words
will bear to be so rendered; for they did believe in them when they were
wrought, and that they were wrought by the Lord; though they soon forgot
them, and fell into distrust and unbelief; but "by" them (r), or by
means of them; though such wonderful things were done for them in
providence, as before related, which should have engaged their faith and
trust in the Lord; yet, notwithstanding these, they called in question
his providence, power, and goodness.

[Psalms 78:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 78:33</span></span>

Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,.... They were not
immediately cut off by the hand of God, though some were; but the
greatest part spent their time, for about eight and thirty years
together, in fruitless marches to and fro in the wilderness, and never
entered into the land of Canaan, where they were gradually wasted and
consumed, till at length all their carcasses fell in the wilderness; see
[Num 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#032.md), time spent in sin is all
waste time, and is spent in vanity; let a man enjoy ever so much of
worldly things, it is all vanity and vexation of spirit; if he does not
get to heaven at last, his life here is lived in vain; it had been
better if he had never been born:

and their years in trouble: or "in terror" (a) and consternation;
through their enemies, who smote and discomfited them, [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045.md), through the earth's opening and
swallowing many of them up; through fire coming from heaven on some of
them, and fiery serpents being sent among them all, [Num
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#031.md). It is an awful consideration,
and yet it is true, of some wicked men, though not all, that they have
nothing but trouble here, by what their sins bring upon them, and hell
at last. Kimchi renders the word here used "suddenly", and interprets it
of the sudden death of the spies; so the Syriac and Arabic versions
"swiftly", following the Vulgate Latin, which renders it "with haste".

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 78:34</span></span>

When he slew them,.... Some of them, the spies particularly; or when he
threatened to slay them, or was about to do it:

then they sought him; that is, those who either survived the slain, or
were threatened with destruction; these sought the Lord by prayer and
supplication, that he would not destroy them; the Targum is,

"they repented and sought him;''

see [Num 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#037.md),

and they returned; from their evil ways, and by repentance, at least in
show and appearance:

and inquired early after God; but not earnestly, and with their whole
hearts and spirits; the Targum is,

"they prayed before God;''

which is often done, by carnal professors, in trouble; see [Isa
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md), [Hos

And they remembered that God was their Rock,.... Who had delivered them
out of the hands of their enemies, had strengthened them against them,
and supported and protected them, as well as supplied them with all good
things, of whom they had been greatly unmindful; but affliction was a
means of refreshing their memory; see [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md),

and the high God their Redeemer; who had redeemed them out of Egypt, out
of the house of bondage, with a high hand and a mighty arm, and thereby
showed himself to be the most high God: between this and the following
verse the Masorah puts this note,

"half of the book,''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">psa 78:36</span></span>

Nevertheless, they did flatter him with their mouth,.... In prayer to
him, they only drew nigh to him with their mouths, and honoured him with
their lips; they showed much love to him and his ways and ordinances
hereby; but their hearts were not with him, but after their lusts; they
made fine speeches and fair promises, but their hearts and mouths did
not agree; they spoke with a double heart, thinking and endeavouring to
"deceive" the Lord, as the word (b) here used signifies; but he is not
to be deceived, nor will he be mocked; the Targum is,

"they allured (or persuaded) him, with their mouth;''

they attempted to do so; the Syriac and Arabic versions are, "they loved
him with their mouth"; professed great love and sincere affection to
him, when they had none:

and they lied unto him with their tongues; to lie unto men is bad, but
to God is worse; and it is a most vain and foolish thing, since there is
not a word in the tongue of any but is known to him.

For their heart was not right with him,.... Neither prepared and ready
to any good work, but reprobate thereunto; nor steady, fixed, and
established, as a good man's heart is, trusting in the Lord; but
wavering, fickle, and inconstant; nor true, faithful, and upright; but
turning aside like a deceitful bow, as is afterwards said, [Psa
78:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#057.md),

neither were they steadfast in his covenant; which was made with them at
Sinai, though they promised to be obedient, and to do all the Lord said
unto them; but this covenant they broke, though he were an husband to
them; see [Exo 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 78:38</span></span>

But he, being full of compassion,.... Or merciful; having bowels of
mercy, as a tender mother to the son of her womb; a word from the same
root as this signifies the womb: the mercies of God are tender and
abundant; there is a multitude of them; he is rich and plenteous in
mercy, and so ready to forgive; hence it follows,

forgave their iniquity; forgiveness of sin flows from the tender mercy
of God; it is according to the multitude of his mercies, and the riches
of his grace; yet is through the blood and attoning sacrifice of his
Son; and the word (c) that is here used signifies to expiate or atone;
God never intended to pardon sinners, but through the propitiation of
his Son, whom he set forth in his purpose, and sent forth in the fulness
of time to be the propitiatory sacrifice for sin; he forgave the sins of
Old Testament saints with a view to that; and it is for Christ's sake he
forgives any; for without shedding of blood there is no remission;
though perhaps, since these persons were impenitent, unbelievers and
hypocrites, no more may be meant here by the forgiveness of their sins
than averting a threatened judgment, or a removing of one, and putting a
stop to the further execution of it, which is sometimes meant by
forgiving sin; see [Num 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019.md), [Kg1
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030.md) which sense the following words
incline to:

and destroyed them not; though they deserved it, and he was able to do
it, he did not destroy them immediately and at once, nor all of them, at
least not their seed and posterity, who were preserved and brought into
the land of Canaan:

yea, many a time turned he his anger away; he does not retain it for
ever, or always carry on a resentment, or the appearance of it; though
he causes grief, he has and shows compassion; he is said to turn away
his anger from his own people when he forgives their sins, and comforts
their souls, [Psa 85:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002.md), so when he
causes the effects of his displeasure to cease, or stays a plague, or
stops a judgment, by means of any of his servants; see [Num
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#008.md),

and did not stir up all his wrath; which their sins deserved, and was
laid up among his treasures: the wrath of a temporal king is as the
roaring of a lion, [Pro 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012.md) much
more that of the King of kings; and the allusion here seems to be to the
arousing of some fierce creature; the wrath of God is intolerable, and,
even when it is kindled but a little, it cannot be endured; and much
less should it be all stirred up; but here in wrath he remembered mercy.

For he remembered that they were but flesh,.... Or "children of flesh",
as the Targum; poor, frail, weak, mortal creatures, unable to bear the
weight of his displeasure, the stroke of his hand, and the lighting down
of his arm, with the indignation of his wrath; that they must be crushed
before him, and would sink, and fail, and die; see [Psa
103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014.md), or that they were naturally
sinful and corrupt, prone to evil, easily drawn into sin; it was what
their depraved natures inclined unto; they were impotent to that which
is good, and unable to withstand temptations to evil; all which was
taken notice of and considered by the Lord in his condescending
goodness, and therefore he dealt gently with them; see [Gen
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md),

a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again; such is the life of man;
it may be fitly compared to the wind, which moves swiftly, and, passing
on, loses its strength and subsides; so the life of man is quickly gone,
his days move swiftly on, he dies, and returns not again to his former
state, to a mortal life; and though the spirit returns to the body
again, yet not till the resurrection; and then not of itself, but by the
power of God; see [Job 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 78:40</span></span>

How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness,.... Where they were not
only at his mercy, having nothing to help themselves with, but had many
singular mercies bestowed upon them; and yet were continually committing
such sins against God as provoked the eyes of his glory; ten times they
tempted him, the Lord says, [Num
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022.md), therefore that dispensation is
called the provocation and day of temptation; for it was a series of
rebellion and sin, [Psa 95:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008.md),

and grieve him in the desert; which signifies the same as before, and is
spoken after the manner of men, [Gen
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006.md) and like a tender parent grieved
at the disobedience of his child, and that he is obliged to take the rod
and chastise it. The prophet Isaiah says, they "vexed" or "grieved his
Holy Spirit", [Isa 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010.md), the same
word is there used as here; compare with it [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">psa 78:41</span></span>

Yea, they turned back, and tempted God,.... They talked of going back to
Egypt, and of choosing a captain to lead them back thither, [Num
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003.md), and they turned back from the
Lord, and from his good ways, and chose their own ways, and followed
after idols; or the sense is, they again tempted God, not only at
Meribah, but elsewhere; they tempted him again and again, even ten
times, as before observed:

and limited the Holy One of Israel; or "signed" (d) him; signed him with
a sign, so the Targum; they tempted him by asking a sign of him, as
Jarchi interprets it; insisting that a miracle be wrought, by which it
might be known whether the Lord was among them or not, [Exo
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007.md), with which compare [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md), or they set bounds, so Kimchi;
to his power and goodness, saying, this he could do, and the other he
could not; see [Psa 78:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#019.md), and so men
limit the Lord when they fix on a blessing they would have, even that,
and not another; and the measure of it, to what degree it should be
bestowed on them, as well as set the time when they would have it;
whereas the blessing itself, and the degree of it, and the time of
giving it, should be all left with the Lord; who knows which and what of
it is most convenient for us, and when is the best time to bestow it on
us.

They remembered not his hand,.... Which brought them out of Egypt, and
dashed their enemies in pieces, and which had been so often opened to
supply their wants in the wilderness; the Targum renders it, the
miracles of his hand:

nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy; Pharaoh king of
Egypt; that very memorable day in which they were delivered out of his
hands, that selfsame day which had been fixed, by promise and prophecy
many hundreds of years before, in which the hosts of the Lord went out
of Egypt, [Exo 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#041.md), times when as
well as places where deliverances and salvation have been wrought should
not be forgotten; and forgetfulness of the goodness of God in times past
is often the cause and occasion of sinning against him, which, by a
remembrance of his kind appearances, might be prevented.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">psa 78:43</span></span>

How he had wrought his signs in Egypt,.... The plagues which he brought
upon the Egyptians, for refusing to let Israel go:

and his wonders in the field of Zoan, or in the country of Zoan, that
is, Tanis, as the Targum renders it; so the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin
versions; see [Psa 78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012.md), an
enumeration of these signs and wonders follows; but not of all, nor in
the order in which they were: only seven are mentioned, with which
compare the seven vials or last plagues, [Rev

streams; this was the first of the plagues of Egypt, [Exo

drowning the infants of the Israelites in their river, [Exo

on spiritual Egypt, and with equal justice; see [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md),

and their floods, that they could not drink; the rivulets that flowed
from the Nile, and every spring or confluence of water; or rather by
these rivers and floods are meant the canals and ditches, which, as
Jarchi (e) observes, were made by the hands of men, from the banks of
the river Nile, to water their fields with.

He sent divers sorts of flies among them,.... This was the fourth
plague; see [Exo 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#024.md), the word
signifies a "mixture" (f), and the Targum renders it

"a mixture of wild beasts;''

so Josephus (g) understood this plague of various sorts of beasts of
different forms, and such as had never been seen before. Aben Ezra, on
[Exo 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#024.md) interprets it of evil beasts
mixed together, as lions, wolves, bears, and leopards; and Jarchi, on
the same place, of serpents and scorpions: the Syriac and Arabic
versions here, following the Septuagint, render the word "dog flies"; so
called because they were, as Pliny (h) says, very troublesome to dogs,
and so might give the Egyptians greater uneasiness, because they
worshipped dogs. God can make use of very mean and contemptible
instruments, the least of insects, to plague and distress the most
powerful enemies of his people;

which devoured them; corrupted their land, [Exo
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#024.md), perhaps produced a pestilence,
which destroyed many of the inhabitants, or consumed the vegetables of
the land; as but a few years ago (e), in New England, a sort of insects
came out of little holes in the ground, in the form of maggots, and
turned to flies, which for the space of two hundred miles poisoned and
destroyed all the trees in the country (i):

and frogs, which destroyed them; with their stench; see [Exo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#005.md), with this plague compare [Rev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013.md), this was the second plague.

and the same with the locust in the next clause; for we read but of the
locust only in [Exo 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#013.md).

and their labour unto the locust; which devoured the increase of the
field, all green grass and trees, all sorts of corn, wheat, barley and
rye, and the increase of vineyards, and all fruit trees, on which much
labour had been used to manure and cultivate; see [Rev

He destroyed their vines with hail,.... Or "killed" (k) them; for there
is a vegetative life in plants: this was the seventh plague of Egypt,
attended with thunder and lightning, and was very terrible to Pharaoh,
[Exo 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#023.md), with this compare [Rev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021.md),

and their sycamore trees with frost: sycamore trees, according to
Kimchi, were a sort of wild figs, and these with the vines are only
mentioned; though the plague of hail destroyed all sorts of trees;
because there were many of these in Egypt, and are put for all others;
and who also observes, that the word rendered "frost", which is only
used in this place, signifies a kind of hail; and so Aben Ezra
interprets it of great hailstones which beat off the fruit of the
sycamore trees: but R. Saadiah Gaon explains it by the Arabic word
"Al-sakia", which signifies a strong frost which breaks the buds of
trees, and dries up their moisture. Jarchi will have it to be, according
to the Midrash, a kind of locust, which comes and sits and cuts off the
green of the trees and grass, and eats it. Aben Ezra makes mention of
this sense, but rejects it.

and beast, as well as upon herbs and trees, [Exo

and their flocks to hot thunderbolts: which were killed by them: this is
to be understood of the fire that was mingled with the hail, and ran
upon the ground, and destroyed their flocks, [Exo

interprets the words of fowls which devoured the sheep killed by the
hail.

He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger,.... This with the
following words,

wrath, and indignation, and trouble, are thought by some to intend the
other plagues, which are not particularly mentioned; or rather they
express the manner in which they were all inflicted, in great wrath and
hot displeasure for their sins and iniquities, and which particularly
were shown

by sending evil angels among them; not evil in themselves, but because
they were the instruments God made use of to bring evil things upon the
Egyptians, as good angels often are; though some think that demons,
devils, or wicked spirits, were sent among them at that time; the
darkness was over all the land, and frightened them; in the Apocrypha:

"3 For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were
scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished,
and troubled with strange apparitions. 4 For neither might the corner
that held them keep them from fear: but noises as of waters falling down
sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy
countenances.'' (Wisdom 17)

According to Arama, the three last plagues are meant: the words may be
rendered "messengers of evil things" (l), as they are by some, and be
understood of Moses and Aaron, who were sent time after time with
messages of evil things to Pharaoh, in which were expressed his wrath
and fury against them.

his anger" (m); he weighed it in the balance of justice, and
proportioned his anger to their crimes, and punished them according to
their just deserts:

he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the
pestilence; which some understand of their cattle, and of the murrain
that came upon them, by which they were destroyed, and which was the
fifth plague of Egypt, [Exo 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#003.md), so

12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md),

the chief of their strength; or first of it, as the firstborn is called,
[Gen 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md),

in the tabernacles of Ham; in the several cities, towns, villages, and
houses of the Egyptians, the descendants of cursed Ham; for Mizraim,
from whom the Egyptians have their name, and from whence they sprung,
was a son of Ham's, [Gen 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006.md). Perhaps
No Ammon may be particularly meant, [Nah
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md), the same with Memphis, and which
signifies the mansion or palace of Ammon, that is, Ham; and so Chemmis,
another city in Egypt, signifies the same (n); of which see [Psa
105:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023.md) this was the tenth and last
plague: according to Suidas (o), the plagues of Egypt continued forty
days.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">psa 78:52</span></span>

But made his own people to go forth like sheep,.... The people of
Israel, whom the Lord chose to be his peculiar people above all others;
these he caused to go forth out of Egypt, with a mighty hand and
stretched out arm; like sheep, weak, timorous, unarmed, harmless, and
inoffensive, not a dog daring to move his tongue at them: the power of
God was wonderfully displayed in the delivery of his poor, helpless, and
oppressed people, well may it be ascribed to him; for it was not their
arm, but his, that brought them out:

and guided them in the wilderness like a flock; by the hands of Moses
and Aaron, [Psa 77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020.md), he also going
before them as the Shepherd of the flock, in a pillar of cloud by day,
and in a pillar of fire by night; he kept them together as a flock from
scattering, straying, and being lost; and directed their way in the
untrodden wilderness, through all the windings and turnings of it, and
protected them from all dangers and enemies.

[Psalms 78:53](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">psa 78:53</span></span>

And he led them on safely,.... Through the sea, where the waters were on
each side; and through the wilderness, in which were serpents and
scorpions, and where they were attacked by many powerful enemies:

so that they feared not; for though they feared for a while at the Red
sea, yet their fears were soon silenced, and they by faith passed
through the Red sea as on dry land; and especially their fears were
gone, when they saw the Egyptians dead on the sea shore; wherefore it
follows:

but the sea overwhelmed their enemies; or "covered" them (p); the waters
returned, and overflowed and drowned the Egyptians, who were their
implacable enemies, and vowed their destruction, and were sure of it;
but now the Israelites had nothing to fear from them.

And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,.... Of the land of
Canaan, which the Lord had sanctified, and set apart for them; and of
Jerusalem, the holy city, the city of the great God, and of the temple
where his residence was to be; so the Targum,

"to the border of the place of the house of his sanctuary:''

even to this mountain, which his right hand purchased; the mount Moriah,
on which the temple was built; this psalm being composed, as Aben Ezra
and Kimchi think, after it was made known to David, by the prophet Gad,
the place where the temple should be built; namely, on the very
mountain, on part of which David had his palace; and this was obtained
and possessed, not by the power nor through the merits of the
Israelites, but through the power and goodness of God; see [Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 78:55](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#055.md)

He cast out the Heathen also before them,.... The seven nations, the
Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and
Jebusites, [Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md).

and divided them an inheritance by line: the land of Canaan was divided
among the nine tribes and a half by Joshua, the other two and a half
having had their portion assigned them on the other side; this
distribution was made very exactly by lot, by line, and measure, so that
every tribe had their proper portion and inheritance; see [Jos
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#006.md),

and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents; in the cities,
towns, villages, and houses of the Heathen cast out before them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">psa 78:56</span></span>

Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God,.... After the death of
Joshua, and in the times of the judges, by worshipping and serving the
gods of the nations, and forsaking the Lord their God, who had done such
great things for them, [Jdg 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md),

and kept not his testimonies; the laws of God, which testified and
declared his mind and will; nor observed his word and ordinances, which
testified of his grace, and of the way of salvation by Jesus Christ.

[Psalms 78:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">psa 78:57</span></span>

But turned back,.... From God and his worship, apostatized from the true
religion, and turned to idols:

and dealt unfaithfully, like their fathers; in the wilderness; see [Psa
78:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#008.md),

they were turned aside like a deceitful bow; that promises well to carry
the arrow right, but drops it at the feet of the archer; or carries it
another way, so that it misses the mark, The Targum is,

"as a bow casting arrows;''

to the ground, and not to the mark; see [Hos
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016.md), or being too much stretched is
suddenly broken, and kills the archer; or returns to its own nature; so
Arama.

[Psalms 78:58](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">psa 78:58</span></span>

For they provoked him to anger with their high places,.... Which they
built to Baal, and other Heathen dieties:

and moved him to jealousy with their graven images; which they
worshipped, see [Jdg 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md), which
idolatry was spiritual adultery, and so made the Lord jealous of them,
who stood in the relation of a husband to them, as a man becomes jealous
by the unchaste and lascivious conduct of his wife; and such a course of
life the Israelites lived, throughout the reigns of the judges, at
certain seasons, until the times of Eli and Samuel, when the ark was
carried captive, of which mention is made in the following verses.

[Psalms 78:59](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">psa 78:59</span></span>

When God heard this,.... Their building high places, and sacrificing on
them, their making and worshipping graven images, and the language which
such actions spoke; who also heard what they said to their idols, when
they paid their devotion to them, acknowledging them to be their gods;
he took notice of and observed all this, for nothing could pass his all
seeing eye and hearing ear; and who acted as a righteous Judge, first
heard, and then proceeded to give and execute the sentence; by which he
let them know that he did hear and observe what they said and did:

he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel; not his remnant among them,
according to the election of grace, which he in all ages had; for this
would be contrary to his everlasting love, which always continues; to
the immutability of his nature, who changes not; to his Word, who says,
fury is not in me; and to his oath, who hath sworn that he will not be
wroth with his people: he may indeed, and does, abhor their sins, but
not their persons; he may seem to them and others, in the dispensations
of his providence, to be wroth with them and abhor them; but does not in
reality. This is to be understood of the bulk of the people in general,
and is to be explained and illustrated by those several instances of his
displeasure with them in the times of the judges; when his anger waxed
hot against them for their idolatries and other sins, and he delivered
them up into the hands of their enemies, [Jdg
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 78:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">psa 78:60</span></span>

So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh.... The tabernacle which
Moses built in the wilderness by the command of the Lord, and according
to the pattern showed him; and which, when the Israelites were settled
in the land of Canaan, was set up in Shiloh; see [Jos
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md), and here it was in the times of
Eli and Samuel, which are here referred to:

the tent which he placed among men; it was as a tent moveable from place
to place, and was to continue at longest but for a while, as the whole
tabernacle worship and service was to do; here the divine Majesty dwelt,
and among men, vile, sinful, wicked, and ungrateful men; which was a
wonderful instance of his condescension and goodness, [Kg1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027.md), but when their iniquities grew
to such a degree as were intolerable, he forsook it and removed it
elsewhere; see [Jer 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012.md), rather the
words may be rendered, "the tent", or "tabernacle, which he had fixed in
Adam"; as they are by Doctor Lightfoot (q); that is, in the city Adam,
which was in the centre of the parting of the waters of Jordan, and
where was the station of the tabernacle and ark of the covenant, when
Israel entered into them, and passed through them; which is mentioned as
a wonderful circumstance, both with respect to the tabernacle and to the
people of Israel.

[Psalms 78:61](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">psa 78:61</span></span>

And delivered his strength into captivity,.... That is, the ark, called
his strength, and the ark of his strength, [Psa
105:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004.md), because it was a token of his
strength, and by means of which he displayed it, as when the Israelites
passed through Jordan into Canaan's land, and encompassed the city of
Jericho; and besides, it was typical of Christ, the man of God's right
hand, made strong for himself, and in whom is strength as well as
righteousness for his people; now this was delivered up into the hands
of the Philistines, and carried captive, [Sa1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#011.md). The Targum renders it, "his
law", because the two tables of the law were in the ark; so Jarchi
interprets it, the ark and the tables:

and his glory into the enemy's hand; which designs the same thing, the
ark being the glory of God, over which upon the mercy seat the glorious
majesty of the Lord was; hence Phinehas's wife, when she heard the ark
was taken, fell into labour, her time being near, and brought forth a
son, and called him Ichabod, saying, the glory is departed from Israel,
for the ark of God is taken, [Sa1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#021.md).

[Psalms 78:62](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">psa 78:62</span></span>

He gave his people over also to the sword,.... To those that kill with
the sword, as the Targum; that is, to the Philistines, when there fell
of them thirty thousand men at once, [Sa1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010.md).

and was wroth with his inheritance; and the above showed that he was,
though they were his inheritance, his portion and possession, and he had
chosen them for it, [Psa 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 78:63](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">psa 78:63</span></span>

The fire consumed their young men,.... Not Nadab and Abihu, as some of
the Jewish Rabbins interpret it, of which Jarchi makes mention; but the
young men, the choice, the flower, of the Israelitish army, which
engaged with the Philistines in the times of Eli; and the fire that
consumed them is not to be understood of material fire, or of
extraordinary fire from heaven, but either of the wrath of God, as
Jarchi, or of the flaming glittering sword of the enemy, which consumed
them like fire; see [Num 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028.md).

and their maidens were not given to marriage; the young men to whom they
should have been married, and to whom they might have been espoused,
being slain in battle: or, "were not honoured" (a); that with marriage,
which is honourable to all, [Heb 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md),
or "were not praised" (b); were not attended with epithalamies and
nuptial songs, such as used to be sung at the time of marriage; hence,
as Kimchi observes, the nuptial chamber is called , "the house of
praise"; and so frequently, when a great calamity is threatened or
described, it is said, the voice of the bride and bridegroom is not
heard; see [Jer 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009.md).

[Psalms 78:64](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">psa 78:64</span></span>

Their priests fell by the sword,.... Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of
Eli, and other priests; which shows the cruelty of the enemy, not to
spare men unarmed, as the priests were; and the justice of God, which
pursued these men, who were very wicked, and whose character and office
could not secure them from divine wrath:

and their widows made no lamentation; for their husbands the priests,
who fell by the sword; particularly the widow of Phinehas, who upon the
news fell into labour, and as soon as she brought forth her child died,
and while she lived took no notice of the death of her husband, nor
lamented that, only that the ark of the Lord was taken, [Sa1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#019.md), and which might be the case of
others; nor could they attend their funerals, or follow them to the
grave with lamentations, they falling in battle; and such was their
concern for the public loss, that their private sorrow was swallowed up
in it. Some understand it of the disrespect and neglect of others, who
came not to lament with them, and comfort them, as was usual: one of the
Targums paraphrases the whole thus,

"at the time that the Philistines carried captive the ark of the Lord,
the priests of Shiloh, Hophni, and Phinehas, fell by the sword; and at
the time they brought their wives the news of it, they wept not, for
they died even the same day.''

[Psalms 78:65](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">psa 78:65</span></span>

Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,.... He seemed to be asleep,
while he suffered the ark to be taken, and the Israelites to be slain;
and he may be said to awake when he exerted his power in smiting the
Philistines, and causing their idol to fall before his ark; see [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006.md),

and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine; who having taken
a free draught of generous wine, not to excess, goes forth with great
courage and cheerfulness to meet his adversary, shouting as he goes,
being sure of victory; which must be applied to God with decency,
consistent with the glory of his majesty, and the perfections of his
nature; and seems designed to express his power and readiness to help
his people, and avenge himself on his enemies; see [Isa
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 78:66](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">psa 78:66</span></span>

And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts,.... Not the Israelites, as
Kimchi interprets it, but the Philistines, who in another battle were
put to flight, and turned their backs, and so were smitten in their
hinder parts; or rather this has reference to the Philistines being
smitten with haemorrhoids, or piles in their posteriors, while the ark
was retained a captive by them, [Sa1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006.md), and so the Targum paraphrases it,

"and he smote them that troubled them with haemorrhoids in their
posteriors;''

the Greek version, as quoted by Suidas (c), is, "he smote his enemies on
the back parts of the seat"; signifying, he says, a disease, modestly
expressed:

he put them to a perpetual reproach; either by causing their idol Dagon
to fall before his ark, and be broken upon the threshold of the house of
the idol; in memory of which the priests ever after, nor any that came
in thither, trod upon the threshold, [Sa1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#003.md), or rather through their sending
golden images of their haemorrhoids, and golden mice along with the ark,
which were reserved to their perpetual reproach: other instances of the
Lord's regard to Israel follow, in providing a proper place for the ark,
and appointing a suitable governor over the people.

[Psalms 78:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">psa 78:67</span></span>

Moreover, he refused the tabernacle of Joseph,.... That is, the
tabernacle of Moses, which had been for a long time at Shiloh, a city in
the tribe of Ephraim, the son of Joseph; when the ark was brought back
by the Philistines, it was not returned to Shiloh, but carried to
Kirjathjearim, where it remained twenty years, and after that was had to
Zion, the city of David, [Sa1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md), so
the Targum,

"and he rejected the tabernacle which he had stretched out in the border
of Joseph;''

he did not refuse the tabernacle, or remove his presence from it; but he
refused the place it had been in, or refused that it should be any more
there:

and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: the same thing is designed as
before; the meaning is, not that he rejected the tribe of Ephraim from
being one of the tribes of Israel; nor does it refer to the revolt of
Ephraim, or the ten tribes, from the pure worship of God to idolatry,
and their separation from the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin; or to
their being carried captive into Assyria; since this historical
narration reaches no further than the reign of David, or the time of
Solomon at furthest; whereas the facts mentioned were a long time
afterwards; nor does it regard the removal of government from the tribe
of Ephraim, which was the seat of it in the times of Joshua, of which
tribe he was, [Num 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#008.md), though this
tribe was overlooked in the choice of a king, one of the tribe of
Benjamin being first chosen; and when he was rejected, then one of the
tribe of Judah; but this purely, at least principally, intends that it
was the will of God that the seat of worship should not be in this tribe
any longer; that the ark and tabernacle should be no more there: perhaps
the Ephraimites were more culpable, and more provoked the Lord with
their idolatry, than the other tribes, since they are first and last
taken notice of as the objects of the divine resentment in this account;
see [Psa 78:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#009.md).

[Psalms 78:68](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">psa 78:68</span></span>

But chose the tribe of Judah,.... Both to be the seat of kingly power
and government, and of religious worship; the latter is chiefly
designed. Jerusalem was, at least part of it, in the tribe of Judah:
here David, who was of that tribe, dwelt, and Solomon his son, and all
the kings of Judah afterwards; here the temple was built, into which the
ark of the covenant was put, and whither the tribes went up to worship

the mount Zion, which he loved; where was the city of David; into which
the ark was brought when removed from Gibeah, and on part of which the
temple was built: the choice of this place, for such a purpose, was from
love, [Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md), it was typical of the
church, the choice of which also arises from the everlasting and
unchangeable love of God to it.

[Psalms 78:69](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">psa 78:69</span></span>

And he built his sanctuary like high palaces,.... The temple at
Jerusalem, called a sanctuary, or holy place, because separated and
dedicated to holy use and service; where the holy God had his residence,
and was worshipped, and was a figure of the holy place not made with
hands: this is said to be built by the Lord, because the materials
provided for it, and which David and his people so willingly offered,
were his own; "of his own" they gave him; as well as the pattern after
which it was made was had from the Spirit of God; and it was the Lord
that put it into the heart of David to set such a work afoot, and
encouraged Solomon to begin and finish it, and gave wisdom, health, and
strength, to the workmen to accomplish it; and in reference to this are
the words in [Psa 127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md), "except the
Lord build the house", &c. and this he built not like the "high places",
where idolatry was committed; the temple was not built in imitation of
them; but like what high and eminent men, like such buildings as: they
erect; like stately palaces, so Aben Ezra and Kimchi, built for kings
and great personages; and such a building was the temple, the most
magnificent in all the world, as built by Solomon, and even as rebuilt
by Zerubbabel, and repaired by Herod; see [Mar
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md) or it was built "on high", as the
Syriac version, on a high hill, Mount Moriah: the Targum is,

"as the horn of the unicorn;''

and so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions. Jarchi
interprets it as the high heavens, of which it was a figure; it was like
them for magnificence and glory, and like the earth for stability, as
follows:

like the earth, which he hath established for ever; as to the substance
of it; though as to the qualities of it, it will be done away, and a new
one arise; otherwise it will abide for ever, [Ecc
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004.md), this respects the continuance of
the temple during the Jewish dispensation, when the Gospel temple, or
Gospel church, should take place, which will continue to the end of the
world: this is opposed to the frequent moves of the tabernacle and ark
before the temple was built, when there was no abiding habitation
provided for it.

[Psalms 78:70](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">psa 78:70</span></span>

He chose David also his servant,.... To be king of Israel, the youngest
of his father's family, when he rejected all the rest; see [Sa1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006.md), an eminent type of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who is called by his name, [Psa
89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003.md) and the signification of his name
"Beloved" agrees with him, who is beloved of God, as his Son, and as man
and Mediator; and beloved of men, of all the saints: and so likewise his
character as a servant suits with him; who not only frequently has the
name of a servant, [Psa 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md), but
appeared in the form of one, [Phi 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md),
had the work of a servant to do, which he has accomplished, even the
great work of our salvation, [Joh
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md), in doing which, and all things
leading on and appertaining to it, he took the utmost delight and
pleasure, and used the greatest diligence and assiduity, [Joh
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034.md) and justly acquired the character
of a faithful and righteous servant, [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md), and to this work and office he
was chosen and called by his Father, [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md),

and took him from the sheepfolds; from whence he was fetched when Samuel
was sent by the Lord to anoint him, [Sa1
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#011.md), so Moses, while he was feeding
his father's sheep, was called to be the saviour and deliverer of
Israel, [Exo 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md), and Amos was taken
from following the flock to be a prophet of the Lord, [Amo
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#013.md), and as David was a type of
Christ, this may express the mean condition of our Lord, in his state of
humiliation, previous to his exaltation, and the more open exercise of
his kingly office.

[Psalms 78:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">psa 78:71</span></span>

From following the ewes great with young,.... Or, "from after" them (a);
it was usual with the shepherd to put them before him, and to follow
them, and gently drive them, which is expressive of his care and
tenderness of them; see [Gen 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#013.md),
the same is observed of David's antitype, the great and good Shepherd of
the sheep, [Isa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md). David was a
type of Christ as a shepherd; as he kept his father's sheep, so Christ
keeps those that the Father has given him, [Joh
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029.md), as David kept his flock with
great care and courage, and in safety, [Sa1
17:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034.md), so does the Lord Jesus Christ
keep his flock in safety, and preserves it from Satan, the roaring lion,
and from grievous wolves that enter into it, and every beast of prey
that would devour it; and particularly as David took special care of
those that were with young, so does the Lord take special care of such
that are newborn babes, that have Christ formed in them, and are big
with desires after him, carry a burden, and are weary, and heavy laden:
the Targum, Jarchi, and Kimchi, interpret the word (b) of such that give
suck, and so it most properly signifies:

he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance;
that is, to rule over them: this is said in allusion to his having been
a shepherd; and nothing is more common than for kings to be represented
as shepherds, and their acts of government by leading and feeding; and
one and the same word in the Greek language signifies to feed and rule:
and so the Targum,

"he brought him to rule over Jacob his people:''

this was a great honour indeed, to be the governor of the Lord's people,
a special people above all people on the face of the earth, and whom he
had chosen to be his inheritance; and in this also he was a type of
Christ, who has the throne of his father David given him, and who reigns
over the house of Jacob, one of whose titles is King of saints; for as
the government of the world in general, so of the church in particular,
is on his shoulders, [Luk 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md).

[Psalms 78:72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#072.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_072">psa 78:72</span></span>

So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart,.... Or, "reigned
over them", as the Targum; that is, over the people of Israel, and which
he did in such manner as showed uprightness of heart, and that he was,
as his character is, a man after God's own heart: it appeared, by his
administration of government, that he sought not his own honour and
interest, and the aggrandizing of his family, but the good of his
people, and the glory of God; and this character, in the fullest extent,
and highest sense of it, best agrees with Christ, the righteous branch
raised unto David, [Jer 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md),

and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands; or "by the prudencies"
of his hands, as the Targum; or, by the prudencies (c), as in the
original text; with the most consummate wisdom and skill: hands are made
mention of, partly in allusion to the shepherd, as David had been, who
carries a staff in his hand, and guides his flock with it; and partly
with respect to the acts and administration of government, which were
wisely performed by him: he made wise laws for his people and soldiers,
and put them in execution; he behaved wisely in the court and in the
camp; but was greatly and infinitely exceeded by his antitype, the
servant of the Lord, that should deal prudently, [Isa
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md), and who is abundantly qualified
for it, as being not only the Wisdom of God, and the all wise God, but
even, as Mediator, has the spirit of wisdom on him, and the treasures of
wisdom in him.
