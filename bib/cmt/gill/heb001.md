### [Hebrews Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS 1

The intention of this epistle being to demonstrate the superior
excellency of the Gospel revelation to the legal one, the apostle begins
with the divine author of it, in which they both agree, and observes
that in other things they differ. The revelation under the law was made
in times past, the Gospel revelation in these last days; the former was
made to the Jewish fathers that were of old, the latter to the then
present apostles; the one was made at sundry times, and in divers
manners, the other was made at once, and in one way; the one was made by
the prophets of the Lord, the other by his own son, [Heb
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md) and therefore the latter must be
the more excellent; in proof of which the author enlarges on the
character of the Son of God, with respect to his person, office, and
glory; showing that he is heir of all things, the Maker of the worlds,
of the same nature and glory with his Father; is omnipotent, and upholds
all things by the word of his power; is the High Priest of his people,
who has made satisfaction for their sins, and purged them from them, and
is now at the right hand of God, [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md) He goes on to prove that he is
more excellent than the angels, by a variety of arguments, and these
supported by testimonies from the Scriptures; as that he has a more
excellent name than any of them, being called the Son of God, [Heb
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md) which is proved from [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md) that he is the object of the
worship of angels, [Heb 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md) which is
required of them, [Psa 97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md) that he is
their Maker and Creator, [Heb 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md)
which appears from [Psa 104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004.md) that he
has an everlasting kingdom, is a righteous King, and is richly anointed
above his fellows, [Heb 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md) which is
the sense of some passages in [Psa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006.md) and that he is the founder and
former of the heavens, and of the earth, and will endure when they shall
not, [Heb 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md) which is confirmed by
testimonies out of [Psa 102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md) that he
sits at the right hand of God, where none of the angels were ever
admitted, [Heb 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md) as is clear from
[Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) and besides, the angels, as
they are ministers made by him, they are sent out from him to wait on
his people, the heirs of salvation, and minister to them, and therefore
he must be greater than they, [Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md).

[Hebrews 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 1:1</span></span>

God, who at sundry times and in divers manners,.... The apostle begins
the epistle with an account of the revelation God has made of his mind
and will in former times: the author of this revelation is God, not
essentially, but personally considered, even God the Father, as
distinguished from his Son in the next verse; for the revelation under
the Old Testament is divine, as well as that under the New; in this they
both agree, in whatsoever else they differ: and this revelation was made
at several times, at different seasons, and to different persons; and
consisted of a variety of things relating to doctrine and worship, and
concerning the Messiah, his person and office; of whom, at different
times, there were gradual discoveries made, both before and after the
giving of the law, from the beginning of the world, or the giving forth
of the first promise, and in the times of the patriarchs, of: Moses,
David, Isaiah, and other prophets: and this was delivered in various
manners; sometimes by angels; sometimes in a dream; at other times by a
vision; and sometimes by Urim and Thummim: and this he

spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets; by Moses, and other
succeeding prophets, as David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Micah, Zechariah,
Malachi, and others; who were sent to the Jewish fathers, the ancestors
of the people of the Jews, to whom they prophesied and declared the will
of God, as they were moved and inspired by the Holy Ghost: and the
apostle suggests, by this way of speaking, that it was a long time since
God spake to this people; for prophecy had ceased ever since the times
of Malachi, for the space of three hundred years; and this time past
includes the whole Old Testament dispensation, from the beginning to the
end of it, or of prophecy in it.

[Hebrews 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 1:2</span></span>

Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,.... This is the
Gospel revelation, or the revelation in the Gospel dispensation; which
though it comes from the same author the other does, yet in many things
differs from it, and is preferable to it; and indeed the general design
of this epistle is to show the superior excellency of the one to the
other; the former was delivered out in time past, but this "in these
last days"; the Alexandrian copy, the Complutensian edition, and several
other copies, read, "in the last of these days": perfectly agreeable to
the phrase , used in [Gen 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md) to
which the apostle refers, and in which places the days of the Messiah
are intended; and it is a rule with the Jews (m), that wherever the
phrase, "the last days", is mentioned, the days of the Messiah are
designed: and they are to be understood not of the last days of the
natural world, but of, the Jewish world and state; indeed the times of
the Messiah, or Gospel dispensation, may be called the last days of the
natural world, according to the tradition of the house of Elias; which
teaches, that the duration of the world will be six thousand years, and
divides it into three parts, the last of which is assigned to the
Messiah, thus; two thousand years void, (or without the law,) two
thousand years the law, and two thousand years the days of the Messiah
(n): but it is best to understand this of the last days of the Mosaic
economy, or Jewish dispensation; for the Messiah was to come before the
Jewish civil and church states were dissolved; before the sceptre
departed from Judah, and before the second temple was destroyed; and he
was to come at the end, or toward the close of both these states; and
which is called the end, or ends of the world, [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md) and quickly after Jesus, the true
Messiah was come, an end was put to both these: from whence it may be
observed, that the Messiah must be come; that the Mosaic economy, and
Jewish worship, will never be restored again; that the Gospel revelation
being made in the last days, ought to be regarded the more, it being the
last revelation God will ever make. Moreover, this differs from the
former in this respect, that was made to the fathers, this "to us";
meaning either the apostles in particular, or the Jews in general, to
whom the apostle is writing: this shows that the Gospel revelation was
first made to the Jews; and it being made to them personally, they were
under great obligation to regard it; and that God had not cast off his
people; and that though he had greatly indulged their fathers, he had
showed greater favour to them, having provided some better thing for
them: and there is a difference between these two revelations in the
manner in which they were made; the former was at sundry times, and in
divers manners, the latter was made at once, and in one way; that was
delivered out in parts, and by piece meal, this the whole together; the
whole mind and will of God, all his counsel, all that Christ heard of
the Father; it is the faith that was once, and at once, delivered to the
saints; and it has been given out in one way, by the preaching of the
word: to which may be added, that formerly God spoke by many persons, by
the prophets, but now by one only, "by his Son"; who is so not by
creation, nor by adoption, nor by office, but by nature; being his own
Son, his proper Son, begotten of him, of the same nature with him, and
equal to him; and so infinitely preferable to the prophets: he is a Son,
and not a servant, in whom the Father is, and he in the Father, and in
whom the Spirit is without measure; and God is said to speak by him, or
in him, because he was now incarnate; and what he says from God should
be attended to, both on account of the dignity of his person, as the Son
of God, and because of the authority he came with as Mediator: whom he
hath appointed heir of all things; which must be understood of him not
as God, and Creator; for as such he has a right to all things; all that
the Father has are his; the kingdom of nature and providence belongs to
him, he being the Former and Maker of all things; but as Mediator, who
has all things committed to him, to subserve the ends of his office; and
has a kingdom appointed him, and which he will deliver up again the word
all may refer either to persons or things; to persons, not angels, good
or bad, though both are subject to him, yet neither are called his
inheritance; but elect men, who are his portion, and the lot of his
inheritance; and to things relating to these persons, and for their use
and service, in time, and to all eternity; as all temporal things, and
all spiritual ones, the blessings and promises of the covenant of grace,
the gifts and graces of the Spirit, and eternal glory and happiness, the
saints' inheritance, who are joint heirs with Christ.

By whom also he made the worlds; this is said in agreement with the
notions of the Jews, and their way of speaking, who make mention of
three worlds, which they call, the upper world (the habitation of God),
the middle world (the air), and the lower world (o) (the earth); and
sometimes they call them the world of angels (where they dwell), the
world of orbs (where the sun, moon, and stars are), and the world below
(p) (on which we live); and it is frequent in their writings, and prayer
books (q), to call God , "Lord of all worlds"; See Gill on [Heb
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003.md), these God made by his Son, not
as an instrument, but as an efficient cause with him; for by him were
all things made, whether visible or invisible; and the preposition "by"
does not always denote instrumentality, but sometimes efficiency; and is
used of God the Father himself, and in this epistle, [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md).

[Hebrews 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 1:3</span></span>

Who being the brightness of his glory,.... Or "of glory"; of God the
Father, the God of glory, and who is glory itself; so called on account
of his glorious nature and perfections and because of the glorious
manifestations of them in his works of creation and providence, and in
the various dispensations of his grace, and especially in his Son; and
because he is the author of all glory, in the creatures, in the whole
world, in Christ as man and Mediator, and in his own people. Now Christ
is the "brightness" of this, as he is God; he has the same glorious
nature and perfections, and the same glorious names, as Jehovah, the
Lord of glory, &c. and the same glory, homage, and worship given him:
the allusion is to the sun, and its beam or ray: so some render it "the
ray of his glory"; and may lead us to observe, that the Father and the
Son are of the same nature, as the sun and its ray; and that the one is
not before the other, and yet distinct from each other, and cannot be
divided or separated one from another: so the phrase , "the brightness
of his glory", is used of the divine Being, in the Chaldee paraphrases
(r); see the Apocrypha.

"For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted
mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.'' (Wisdom
7:26)

And the express image of his person; this intends much the same as the
other phrase; namely, equality and sameness of nature, and distinction
of persons; for if the Father is God, Christ must be so too; and if he
is a person, his Son must be so likewise, or he cannot be the express
image and character of him; See Gill on [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md).

And upholding all things by the word of his power; the Syriac version
renders it, "by the power of his word", to the same sense, only
inverting the words. The Targumist on [Ch2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006.md) uses a phrase very much like this,
of God, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain; because, adds he, ,
"he bears", or "sustains all things by the arm of his power"; and the
words are to be understood not of the Father, upholding all things by
his essential and powerful Word, his Son; but of the Son himself, who
upholds all creatures he has made; bears up the pillars of the universe;
preserves every creature in its being, and supports it, and supplies it
with the necessaries of life; rules and governs all, and providentially
orders and disposes of all things in the world, and that by his all
powerful will; which makes it manifest, that he is truly and properly
God, and a very fit person to be a priest, as follows:

when he had by himself purged our sins; the Arabic and Ethiopic versions
seem to refer this to God the Father, as if he, by Christ, made the
expiation of sin, and then caused him to sit down at his right hand; but
it belongs to the Son himself, who of himself, and by himself alone, and
by the sacrifice of himself, made atonement for the sins of his people;
which is meant by the purgation of them: he took their sins upon
himself, and bore them, and removed them far away, and utterly abolished
them, which the priests under the law could not do: and when he had so
done,

he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; by "Majesty" is
meant God the Father, to whom majesty belongs; who is clothed with it,
and which is before him: and his "right hand" designs his power,
greatness, and glory, and is expressive of the high honour Christ, as
man, is possessed of; for his sitting here denotes the glorious
exaltation of him in human nature, after his sufferings, and death, and
resurrection from the dead; and shows that he had done his work, and was
accepted, and was now enjoying rest and ease, honour and glory, in which
he will continue; and the place of his session, as well as of the
habitation of God, at whose right hand he sits, is on high, in the
highest heavens.

[Hebrews 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 1:4</span></span>

Being made so much better than the angels,.... Christ is so much better
than the angels, as the Creator, than the creature; as an independent
being, than a dependent one; as he that blesses, than he that is
blessed; as he that is worshipped, than he that worships: as a king,
than his subjects; as a master, than his servants; and as he that sends,
than he that is sent: and Christ may be said to be "made so", when he
was manifested and declared to be so; and he was actually preferred to
them, and exalted above them in human nature, after he had expiated the
sins of his people, and when he was set down at the right hand of God,
as in the latter part of the preceding verse, with which these words
stand connected; for in his state of humiliation, and through his
sufferings and death, he was made lower than they; but when he was risen
from the dead, and ascended to heaven, he was placed at the right hand
of God, where none of them ever was, or ever will be: besides, the
phrase, "being made", signifies no more than that "he was"; and so the
Syriac version renders it, "and he was so much better than the angels";
and so the Ethiopic version, "he is so much better": and this is
observed, to prove him to be more excellent than any creature, since he
is preferred to the most excellent of creatures; and to show, that the
Gospel dispensation is superior to the legal dispensation, which was
introduced by the ministration of angels; and to take off the Jews from
the worship of angels, to which they were prone: and this doctrine of
his could not be well denied by them, since it was the faith of the
Jewish church, that the Messiah should be preferred to the angels: for
in their ancient writings they say of him, he shall be exalted above
Abraham, he shall be lifted up above Moses, and be higher than the
ministering angels (s); and that he is above them, appears from what
follows,

as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they;
which is that of the Son of God, a name peculiar to him; and which
belongs to him in such a sense as it does not to angels, as is evident
from the following verse: and though this name is not founded on his
office, as Mediator, but arises from his nature and relation to God; yet
he was declared to be the Son of God, and it was made manifest, that
this name of right belonged to him, upon the discharge of his office, at
his resurrection and ascension to heaven; and therefore he is said to
obtain it by inheritance; or he appeared to inherit it of right, and
that it was his possession for evermore.

[Hebrews 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 1:5</span></span>

For unto which of the angels said he at any time,.... That is, he never
said to any of the angels what he has said to Christ; namely, what
follows,

thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee for though angels are
called the sons of God, [Job 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md) yet
are never said to be begotten by him; or, with this clause annexed to
it, "this day have I begotten thee"; nor are they ever so called in a
proper sense, or in such sense as Christ is: this is said to Christ, and
of him, in [Psa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md) and that agreeably
to the sense of the Jewish church at this time, or the apostle would
never have produced it to the Hebrews in such a manner; and not only the
whole psalm in general, but this verse in particular, is owned by Jewish
writers (t), both ancient and modern, to belong to the Messiah. Christ
is the Son of God, not by Creation, nor by adoption, nor by office, but
by nature; he is the true, proper, natural, and eternal Son of God; and
as such is owned and declared by Jehovah the Father, in these words; the
foundation of which relation lies in the begetting of him; which refers
not to his nature, either divine or human: not to his divine nature,
which is common with the Father and Spirit; wherefore if his was
begotten, theirs must be also, being the same undivided nature, common
to all three; much less to his human nature, in which he is never said
to be begotten, but always to be made, and with respect to which he is
without Father; nor to his office, as Mediator, in which he is not a
Son, but a servant; besides, he was a Son, previous to his being a
prophet, priest, and King; and his office is not the foundation of his
sonship, but his sonship is the foundation of his office; or by which
that is supported, and which fits him for the performance of it: but it
has respect to his divine person; for as, in human generation, person
begets person, and like begets like, so it is in divine generation;
though care must be taken to remove all imperfection from it, as
divisibility and multiplication of essence, priority and posteriority,
dependence, and the like; nor can the modus, or manner of it, be
conceived, or explained by us: the date of it, today, designs eternity,
as in [Isa 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013.md), which is one
continued day, an everlasting now; and this may be applied to any time
and case, in which Christ is declared to be the Son of God; as at his
incarnation, his baptism, his transfiguration on the Mount, and his
resurrection from the dead, as in [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md) and at his ascension to heaven,
when he was made Lord and Christ, and his divine sonship more manifestly
appeared; which seems to be the time, and case, more especially referred
to here. And again, I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a
Son: which words are taken from [Sa2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md) and the sense is, not that he
should be his son by adoption; or that he would be instead of a father
to him; or that he should be as dear to him as a son is to a father; but
that he was really and properly so; and he would make it manifest, and
own him as such, as he did at Jordan's river, upon the Mount, and at his
resurrection and ascension; though the words are spoken of Solomon, as a
type of Christ, they properly belong to the antitype, who is greater
than Solomon.

[Hebrews 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 1:6</span></span>

And again, when he bringeth the first begotten into the world;.... By
"the first begotten" is meant Christ. This is a name given him in the
Old Testament, and is what the Hebrews were acquainted with, and
therefore the apostle uses it; it is in [Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md) from whence it seems to be taken
here, and which the ancient Jews (u) acknowledge is to be understood of
the Messiah; who, as the Son of God, is the only begotten of the Father,
and was begotten from eternity, as before declared, and before any
creature had a being, and therefore called the firstborn of every
creature, [Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md) and is sometimes
styled the first begotten from the dead; he rose the first in time, and
is the first in causality and dignity: and he may be called the
firstborn, with respect to the saints, who are of the same nature with
him, and are partakers of the divine nature, and are adopted into the
family of God, though they are not in the same class of sonship with
him; and the bringing of him into the world may refer to his second
coming, for this seems agreeable from the natural order of the words,
which may be rendered, "when he shall bring again", &c. that is, a
second time, and from [Psa 97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001.md) from
whence the following words are cited; and from the glory he shall then
have from the angels, who will come with him, and minister to him; and
not to his resurrection from the dead, when he was exalted above angels,
principalities, and powers; though, as we read the words, they seem to
regard his first coming in to this habitable world, at his incarnation
and birth, when he was attended with angels, and worshipped by them,
according to the order of God the Father, as follows:

he saith, and let all the angels of God worship him; these words are
cited from [Psa 97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md) where the angels
are called Elohim, gods. So Aben Ezra on the place observes, that there
are some (meaning their doctors) who say, that "all the gods are the
angels"; and Kimchi says, that the words are not imperative, but are in
the past tense, instead of the future,

all the angels have worshipped him; that is, they shall worship him; as
they have done, so they will do. According to our version, they are
called upon to worship God's firstborn, his only begotten Son, with a
religious worship and adoration, even all of them, not one excepted;
which shows, that Christ, as the first begotten, is the Lord God, for he
only is to be served and worshipped; and that if angels are to worship
him, men ought; and that angels are not to be worshipped, and that
Christ is preferable to them; and the whole sets forth the excellency
and dignity of his person. Philo the Jew (w) often calls the Logos, or
Word of God, his first begotten.

[Hebrews 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 1:7</span></span>

Or "to the angels", as in the following verse, "to the Son", which
stands opposed to this; and the words said to them, or of them, are
found in [Psa 104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004.md)

who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire: this
cannot be understood of the wind and lightning, and of God's making
these his messengers and ministers to do his will; for such a sense is
not suitable to the scope of the psalm, from whence they are taken, nor
to the order of the words in which they stand; for it is not said he
makes spirits, or winds, his angels, and flaming fire his ministers, but
the reverse; and is contrary to the design of the apostle in citing
them, which is to show the superiority of Christ to angels, of whom it
is said, that they are made spirits: they are "spirits", created ones,
and so differ from God the Creator: they are incorporeal ones, and so
differ from men; they are immaterial, and so die not; they are spiritual
substances subsisting in themselves: and they are "made" such by God the
Father, and by the Son the Lord Jesus Christ, within the six days of the
creation, and all at once; for it is not to be supposed that the Lord is
daily making them; and this proves the Son to be God, as well as more
excellent than the angels; unless this is to be understood of the daily
disposal of them in providence, in causing winds, thunder, lightning,
and the like. Some choose to supply the word with "as", and read, who
maketh his angels as winds; for invisibility, velocity, power, and
penetration: "and his ministers as a flame of fire"; and these are the
same with the angels, for they are ministers to God; they attend his
presence; are ready to perform any service for him; they sing his
praise, and are his chariots in which he rides: and they are ministers
to Christ; they attended at his incarnation: were solicitous for his
preservation, ministered to him in distress, assisted at his
resurrection, and accompanied him in his ascension, and will be with him
at his second coming: and they are as a flame of fire, so called from
their great power, force, and swiftness; and from their burning love,
and flaming zeal, hence named seraphim; and because they are sometimes
the executioners of God's wrath, and will descend in flaming fire, when
Christ shall be revealed from heaven: angels sometimes appear in fiery
forms; the chariots and horses of fire, by which Elijah was carried up
to heaven, were no other than angels, in such forms: so the Jews (x) say
of the angels,

"all the angels, their horses are horses of fire, and their chariots
fire, and their bows fire, and their spears fire, and all their
instruments of war fire.''

And they have a notion, that an angel is half water, and half fire (y).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 1:8</span></span>

But unto the Son, he saith,.... What he does not to angels, and which
sets him infinitely above them; which shows him to be a Prince and King,
and not a servant, or minister; and which even ascribes deity to him:

thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: this, with what follows in this
verse, and the next, is taken out of [Psa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006.md) which psalm is not spoken of
Solomon, to whom many things in it will not agree; he was not fairer
than other men; nor was he a warrior; nor was his throne for ever and
ever; and much less a divine person, and the object of worship; but the
Messiah, and so the ancient Jews understand it: the Targum applies it to
him, and mentions him by name in [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md) and some of their modern writers
(z) affirm it is said of the Messiah; though Aben Ezra seems doubtful
about it, saying, it is spoken concerning David, or Messiah his Son,
whose name is so, [Eze 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025.md). Deity is
here ascribed to the Son of God; he is expressly called God; for the
words will not bear to be rendered, "thy throne is the throne of God, or
thy throne is God"; or be supplied thus, "God shall establish thy
throne": nor are the words an apostrophe to the father, but are spoken
to the king, the subject of the psalm, who is distinguished from God the
Father, being blessed and anointed by him; and this is put out of all
doubt by the apostle, who says they are addressed "to the Son", who is
not a created God, nor God by office, but by nature; for though the word
"Elohim" is sometimes used of those who are not gods by nature; yet
being here used absolutely, and the attributes of eternity, and most
perfect righteousness, being ascribed to the person so called, prove him
to be the true God; and this is the reason why his throne is
everlasting, and his sceptre righteous, and why he should be worshipped,
served, and obeyed. Dominion and duration of it are given to him; his
throne denotes his kingly power, and government; which is general, over
angels, good and bad; over men, righteous and wicked, even the greatest
among them, the kings and princes of the earth: and special, over his
church and people; and which is administered by his Spirit and grace in
the hearts of his saints; and by his word and ordinances in his
churches; and by his powerful protection of them from their enemies; and
will be in a glorious manner in the latter day, and in heaven to all
eternity; for his throne is for ever, and on it he will sit for ever:
his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; he will have no successor in it,
nor can his government be subverted; and though he will deliver up the
kingdom to the Father, it will not cease.

A sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom; the sceptre is
an ensign of royalty; and a sceptre of righteousness, or rightness, is
expressive of the justice of government; the Syriac version renders it,
"a sceptre stretched out"; which is a sceptre of mercy, as the instance
of Ahasuerus stretching out his sceptre to Esther shows; and such is the
Gospel of Christ, which holds forth and declares the mercy, grace, and
love of God to men through Christ; and which may be called a sceptre of
righteousness, since it reveals and directs to the righteousness of
Christ, and encourages to works of righteousness; but here it designs
the righteous administration of Christ's kingly office; for just and
true are, have been, and ever will be his ways, as King of saints.

[Hebrews 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 1:9</span></span>

Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity,.... Christ loves
righteous persons and righteous works, faithfulness and integrity, and a
just administration of government, everything that is holy, just, and
good; which has appeared in the whole course of his life on earth, in
working out a righteousness for his people, and in encouraging
righteousness in them, which he leads them in the way of; and his love
of justice will still more appear at the last day, when he will judge
the world in righteousness, and give the crown of righteousness to
proper persons: and he hates iniquity; or "unrighteousness", as the
Alexandrian copy and another read; as being contrary to his nature, both
as God and man, and to the righteous law of God; which has appeared by
his inveighing against it, and dehorting from it; by his severity
exercised towards delinquents; by his suffering for it, and abolishing
of it; and by chastising his own people on account of it; and his
abhorrence of it will still more appear at the day of judgment, when all
workers of iniquity, professors and profane, will be bid to depart from
him:

therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
above thy fellows: the anointer is the God of Christ; that is, God the
Father, who is the God of Christ, as man; and is so called, because he
prepared and formed the human nature of Christ, and supported it under
all its sufferings, and has glorified it; and as such Christ prayed unto
him, believed in him, loved him, and obeyed him: the anointed is the Son
of God, the Son spoken to, and is called God in the preceding verse;
though he is not anointed as God, but as Mediator, to be prophet, and
priest, and King: what he is anointed with is not material oil, but
spiritual, the Holy Ghost, as it is explained in [Act
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038.md) called the oil of gladness, in
allusion to the use of oil at feasts and weddings, for the delight and
refreshment of the guests; and because of the spiritual effects of joy
and gladness, both on Christ, as man, and on his people. Now Christ was
anointed as Mediator from all eternity; that is, he was invested with
his office as such; and at his conception and birth he was filled with
the Holy Ghost; who also descended on him at his baptism, after which he
went about doing good, and healing diseases; but here it seems to refer
to the time of his ascension, when he was declared to be Lord and
Christ, the anointed one; and received gifts for men, the fulness of the
Spirit without measure, and with which he was anointed above his
"fellows"; by whom are meant, not the angels, nor the kings and princes
of the earth; but the saints, who are so called, because they are of the
same nature, and are of the same family, and are partakers of the same
spirit, and grace; and having received the unction from him, are also
kings, priests, and prophets, and will be companions with him to all
eternity. Now the reason of his being anointed, or exalted, and made
Lord and Christ, is, because he loves righteousness; see [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md) or rather, because he is anointed
with the Holy Spirit without measure, therefore he loves righteousness;
for the words may be rendered, "thou lovest righteousness--because God,
thy God, hath anointed thee".

[Hebrews 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 1:10</span></span>

And thou Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
earth,.... The person here addressed, as the Lord or Jehovah, and as the
Maker of the heavens and the earth, is the same with the Son spoken to,
and of, before; for the words are a continuation of the speech to him,
though they are taken from another psalm, from [Psa
102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md). The phrase, "thou, Lord" is
taken from [Psa 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md) and is the same
with, "O my God", [Psa 102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md) and
whereas it is there said, "of old", and here, in the beginning, the
sense is the same; and agreeably to the Septuagint, and the apostle,
Jarchi interprets it by "at", or "from the beginning"; and so the Targum
paraphrases it, , "from the beginning", that the creatures were created,
&c. that in the beginning of the creation, which is the apostle's
meaning; and shows the eternity of Christ, the Lord, the Creator of the
earth, who must exist before the foundation of the world; and confutes
the notion of the eternity of the world: and the rounding of it shows
that the earth is the lower part of the creation; and denotes the
stability of it; and points out the wisdom of the Creator in laying such
a foundation; and proves the deity of Christ, by whom that, and all
things in it, were made:

the heavens are the works of thine hands: there are more heavens than
one; there are the airy heaven, and the starry heaven, and the heaven of
heavens, the third heaven; and they were created the beginning, as the
earth was, [Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md) and are the
immediate work of Christ; they were made by himself, not by the means of
angels, who were not in being till these were made; nor by any
intermediate help, which he could not have, and which he did not need:
the phrase is expressive of the power of Christ in making the upper
parts of the creation, and of his wisdom in garnishing them, in which
there is a wonderful display of his glory; and the whole serves to set
forth the dignity and excellency of his person.

[Hebrews 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 1:11</span></span>

They shall perish,.... That is, the heavens and the earth; not as to the
substance of them, but as to the quality of them; the present form and
fashion of them shall pass away; the curse will be removed from them,
and they will be renewed and purified, but the substance of them will
continue; otherwise there would be no place, either for the righteous or
the wicked,

But thou remainest; without any change or alteration, neither in his
natures, divine or human, as God or man, nor in his office as Mediator;
as a priest, he has an unchangeable priesthood, and ever lives to make
intercession; as a King, his kingdom is an everlasting one, and of it
there will be no end; and as a prophet, he will be the everlasting
light, of his people.

They all shall wax old as doth a garment; garments in time wax old, and
lose their beauty and usefulness, unless when a miracle is wrought, as
in the case of the children of Israel in the wilderness. Now the
heavens, and the light thereof, are as a garment and a curtain, [Psa
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002.md) and these, together with the
earth, will in time come to their end of usefulness, in the present form
of them; see [Isa 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006.md).

[Hebrews 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 1:12</span></span>

And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up,.... In order to lay them
aside, and make no use of them in the manner they now are; just as
clothes, when they are grown old, or out of fashion, are folded up, and
laid aside from use at present, or are put into another form. In the
Hebrew text it is, "as a vesture shalt thou change them"; but the sense
is the same, for a garment is changed by folding it, or turning it;
agreeably to which Jarchi interprets the Hebrew phrase thus,

"as a man turns his garment to put it off;''

the Vulgate Latin version reads as the Hebrew does, and one of the
manuscripts of New College, Oxford.

And they shall be changed; as to their form and use, not as to their
being; for a change, and an annihilation, are two things:

but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail; which is expressive
of the immutability of Christ, in his nature and perfections, in his
person, and offices, in the virtue of his blood, righteousness, and
sacrifice; and of his duration or continuance, in opposition to the
fading and transitory nature of the heavens and earth, and of all
outward enjoyments: and this may serve to take off the heart from the
one, and set it upon the other; and to strengthen our faith in Christ,
and encourage us to expect a continuance of blessings from him; all
supplies of grace now, and eternal glory hereafter.

[Hebrews 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 1:13</span></span>

But to which of the angels said he at any time,.... That is, he never
said to any of them in his council, or covenant; he never designed to
give them any such honour, as hereafter expressed; he never promised it
to them, or bestowed it on them; he never called up any of them to so
high a place, or to such a dignity:

sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool; yet this
he said to his Son, [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) for to
him, the Messiah, are they spoken, and have had their fulfilment in him:
See Gill on [Mat 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#044.md); and therefore
he must be greater than the angels.

[Hebrews 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 1:14</span></span>

Are they not all ministering spirits,.... Servants to God, to Christ,
and to his people, and therefore must be inferior to the Son of God. The
phrase is Rabbinical; frequent mention is made in Jewish writings (a) of
, "the angels of ministry", or "the ministering angels"; this is their
common appellation with the Jews; and the apostle writing to such, uses
a like phrase, well known to them, and appeals to them, if the angels
were not such spirits.

Sent forth to minister for them who shall be the heirs of salvation? the
persons they minister to, and for, are those, who shall be the heirs of
salvation; that is, of eternal glory, which will be possessed by the
saints, as an inheritance: hence it belongs to children, being
bequeathed to them by their Father, and comes to them through the death
of Christ, of which the Spirit is the earnest; and this shows that it is
not of works, and that it is of an eternal duration, and takes in all
kind of happiness: and of this the saints are heirs now; and so the
Ethiopic version renders it, "who are heirs of salvation"; nor should it
be rendered, "who shall be heirs", but rather, "who shall inherit
salvation"; for this character respects not their heirship, but their
actual inheriting of salvation: and the ministry of angels to, and for
them, lies in things temporal and spiritual, or what concern both their
bodies and their souls; in things temporal, in which they have often
been assisting, as in providing food for their bodies, in curing their
diseases, in directing and preserving them in journeys, in saving and
delivering them from outward calamities, in restraining things hurtful
from hurting them, and in destroying their enemies; in things spiritual,
as in making known the mind and will of God to them, in comforting them,
and suggesting good things to them, and in helping and assisting them
against Satan's temptations; and they are present with their departing
souls at death, and carry them to heaven, and will gather the elect
together at the last day. And they are "sent forth" to minister to them
in such a way; they are sent forth by Christ, the Lord and Creator of
them, who therefore must be superior to them; they do not take this
office upon themselves, though, being put into they faithfully and
diligently execute it, according to the will of Christ: and this shows
the care of Christ over his people, and his kindness to them, and the
great honour he puts upon them, to appoint such to minister to them; and
since they are of so much use and service, they ought to be respected
and esteemed, though not worshipped.
