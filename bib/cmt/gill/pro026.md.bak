### [Proverbs Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 26:1</span></span>

As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,.... Which were very
undesirable and unseasonable, yea, very hurtful to the fruits of the
earth; and a great obstruction to the labourers in the harvest, and a
hinderance to the gathering of it in; and were very rare and uncommon in
Judea; it was even a miracle for thunder and rain to be in wheat
harvest, [Sa1 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#017.md);

so honour is not seemly for a fool: for a wicked man; such should not be
favoured by kings, and set in high places of honour and trust; "folly
set in great dignity", or foolish and bad men set in honourable places,
are as unsuitable and inconvenient as snow and rain in summer and
harvest, and should be as rare as they; and they are as hurtful and
pernicious, since they discourage virtue and encourage vice, and hinder
the prosperity of the commonwealth; such vile persons are contemned in
the eyes of good men, and are disregarded of God; he will not give,
theft, glory here nor hereafter; the wise shall inherit it, but shame
shall be the promotion of fools, [Pro
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035.md); see [Ecc
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#006.md).

[Proverbs 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 26:2</span></span>

As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying,.... As a bird,
particularly the sparrow, as the word (h) is sometimes rendered, leaves
its nest and wanders from it; and flies here and there, and settles
nowhere; and as the swallow flies to the place from whence it came; or
the wild pigeon, as some (i) think is meant, which flies away very
swiftly: the swallow has its name in Hebrew from liberty, because it
flies about boldly and freely, and makes its nest in houses, to which it
goes and comes without fear;

so the curse causeless shall not come; the mouths of fools or wicked men
are full of cursing and bitterness, and especially such who are advanced
above others, and are set in high places; who think they have a right to
swear at and curse those below them, and by this means to support their
authority and power; but what signify their curses which are without a
cause? they are vain and fruitless, like Shimei's cursing David; they
fly away, as the above birds are said to do, and fly over the heads of
those on whom they are designed to light; yea, return and fall upon the
heads of those that curse, as the swallow goes to the place from whence
it came; it being a bird of passage, [Jer
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007.md); in the winter it flies away and
betakes itself to some islands on rocks called from thence "chelidonian"
(k). According to the "Keri", or marginal reading, for here is a double
reading, it may be rendered, "so the curse causeless shall come to him"
(l); that gives it without any reason. The Septuagint takes in both,

"so a vain curse shall not come upon any;''

what are all the anathemas of the church of Rome? who can curse whom God
has not cursed? yea, such shall be cursed themselves; see [Psa
109:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#017.md).

[Proverbs 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 26:3</span></span>

A whip for the horse,.... One that is dull of going, or refractory and
wants breaking;

a bridle for the ass; not to curb and restrain it from going too fist,
asses being generally dull; but to direct its way and turn it when
necessary, it being stiffnecked and obstinate; though the Septuagint,
Syriac, and Arabic versions, render it a "spear" or "goad", something to
prick with, and excite it to motion; and so the Targum; or otherwise one
would have thought the whip was fitter for the ass and the bridle for
the horse;

and a rod for the fool's back; suggesting that the fool, or wicked man,
is like the horse or the mule; though not without understanding of
things natural, yet of things divine and moral; and as stupid as the
ass, however wise he may conceit himself to be, being born like a wild
ass's colt; and instead of honour being given him, stripes should be
laid upon him; he should be reproved sharply, and corrected for his
wickedness, especially the causeless curser, [Pro
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#029.md).

[Proverbs 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 26:4</span></span>

Answer not a fool according to his folly,.... Sometimes a fool, or
wicked man, is not to be answered at all; as the ministers of Hezekiah
answered not a word to Rabshakeh; nor Jeremiah the prophet to Hananiah;
nor Christ to the Scribes and Pharisees; and when an answer is returned,
it should not be in his foolish way and manner, rendering evil for evil,
and railing for railing, in the same virulent, lying, calumniating, and
reproachful language;

lest thou also be like unto him; lest thou also, who art a man of
understanding and sense, and hast passed for one among men, come under
the same imputation, and be reckoned a fool like him.

[Proverbs 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 26:5</span></span>

Answer a fool according to his folly,.... The Targum is,

"but speak with a fool in thy wisdom;''

and the Syriac version,

"yea, speak with a fool according to thy wisdom;''

which would at once remove the seeming contradiction in these words to
the former, but then they are not a true version; indeed it is right,
and must be the sense, that when a fool is answered, as it is sometimes
necessary he should, that it be done in wisdom, and so as to expose his
folly; he is to be answered and not answered according to different
times, places, and circumstances, and manner of answering; he is to be
answered when there is any hope of doing him good, or of doing good to
others; or of preventing ill impressions being made upon others by what
he has said; when the glory of God, the good of the church, and the
cause of truth, require it; and when he would otherwise glory and
triumph, as if his words or works were unanswerable, as follow;

lest he be wise in his own conceit; which fools are apt to be, and the
rather when no answer is given them; imagining it arises from the
strength of their arguments, and their nervous way of reasoning, when it
is rather from a neglect and contempt of them.

[Proverbs 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 26:6</span></span>

He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool,.... Who knows not how
to deliver it in a proper manner, and is incapable of taking the answer,
and reporting it as he should; or unfaithful in it, and brings a bad or
false report, as the spies did upon the good land;

cutteth off the feet; he may as well cut off his feet before he sends
him, or send a man without feet, as such an one; for prudence,
diligence, and faithfulness in doing a message, and bringing back the
answer, are as necessary to a messenger as his feet are;

and drinketh damage; to himself; his message not being rightly
performed, and business not done well; which is a loss to the sender, as
well as to his credit and reputation with the person to whom he sends
him; he hereby concluding that he must be a man of no great judgment and
sense to send such a fool on his errand. Such are the unskilful
ambassadors of princes; and such are unfaithful ministers, the
messengers of the churches; see [Pro
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026.md). The words in the original are
three sentences, without a copulative, and stand in this order, "he that
cutteth off feet; he that drinketh damage; he that sendeth a message by
the hand of a fool"; that is, they are alike.

[Proverbs 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 26:7</span></span>

The legs of the lame are not equal,.... Or as "the lifting up the legs
by one that is lame" (m), to dance to a pipe or violin, is very
unseemly, and does but the more expose his infirmity, and can give no
pleasure to others, but causes derision and contempt;

so is a parable in the mouth of fools; an apophthegm, or sententious
expression of his own, which he delivers out as a wise saying, but is
lame and halts; it is not consistent with itself, but like the legs of a
lame man, one higher than the other: or one of the proverbs of this
book, or rather any passage of Scripture, in the mouth of a wicked man;
or any religious discourse of his is very unsuitable, since his life and
conversation do not agree with it; it is as disagreeable to hear such a
man talk of religious affairs as it is to see a lame man dance; or whose
legs imitate buckets at a well, where one goes up and another down, as
Gussetius (n) interprets the word.

[Proverbs 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 26:8</span></span>

As he that bindeth a stone in a sling,.... That so fastens it to it that
it cannot be slung out of it, it becomes useless and does not answer the
end for which it is put there; or that places it there that it may be
cast out, and is cast out, and so is thrown away, and of no more use; or
that puts a precious stone, so some interpret it, in a heap of common
stones, even in such a heap as is used at the stoning of malefactors; or
increases the heap of stones on such, which the more exposes them, and
the greater reproach they are loaded with; so the more a fool is
praised, it does but bring to mind his folly, and issues in his greater
disgrace, so Gussetius (o): or rather it has respect to a precious stone
put in such a heap of stones, as Luther; or else, according to
Schultens, to such an one put into a heap of sepulchral stones; or, as
Aben Ezra, that binds up a stone, a common stone, in purple, which to do
is ridiculous, so R. Joseph Kimchi; the Vulgate Latin version renders
it,

"as he that casts a stone to Mercury's heap;''

a Heathen deity, called by the eastern people Mertholin and Margenah
(p), which last is near the same with the Hebrew word here used; whose
statue was set up where two or more ways met, to direct travellers; and
who therefore out of respect to the deity, and to show gratitude to him,
used to cast a stone to the heap for the support of it; and which
stones, set up in such doubtful places, were dedicated to him, and were
called after his name (q); and not only travellers did this in honour of
the deity, and to make his statue more manifest (r), but also for
profit, to clear the way from stones; and this custom obtained with the
Indians, Arabs, Saracens, and now does with the Mahometans (s): and such
heaps of stones were also placed in cities, and at the doors of houses,
in honour of Mercury, and were called from him Hermae (t); these stones
were also erected for borders of countries (u). But it is not probable
that this custom obtained in Solomon's time; and yet some Jewish writers
interpret it to this sense, as if he that gives honour to a fool is like
him that casts a stone to Mercury; and Jarchi in the text observes it as
the sense of some of their Rabbins,

"that he that teacheth the law to a disciple that is not fit, is as he
that casts a stone to Mercury;''

and to cast a stone to Mercury is with them the same as to commit
idolatry (w); but either of the former senses is best;

so is he that giveth honour to a fool; it is all thrown away and lost,
as a stone out of a sling; or as unseemly as to put a precious stone
among a heap of stones, or a common stone in purple; See Gill on [Pro
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001.md).

[Proverbs 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 26:9</span></span>

As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard,.... And he perceives it
not; or being in his hand he makes an ill use of it, and hurts himself
and others with it;

so is a parable in the mouth of fools, a proverbial sentence respecting
religious matters; or a passage of holy Scripture which either he
understands not, and has no spiritual perception of, any more than the
drunkard has of the thorn in his hand; or which being used as a pun, or
by way of jest, as it is the manner of some to pun upon or jest with the
Scripture, hurts himself and others, wounds his own conscience, and
ruins the souls of others; for it is dangerous meddling with edge tools,
and hard to kick against the pricks; so to do is like a drunken man's
handling thorns, which he does without judgment, and to his own
prejudice and others. Gussetius (x) understands this of a fish hook
coming up into the hand of a drunkard empty, without taking any thing by
it, and so alike useless is what is said by a fool.

[Proverbs 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 26:10</span></span>

The great God, that formed all things,.... That made the heavens, earth,
and sea, and all that are in them; who is great in the perfections of
his nature, and in the works of his hands, and greatly to be praised;

both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors; according to their
works; every transgression of the law receiving its just recompence of
reward, whether a man transgresses it ignorantly or wilfully; as his
transgressions are, whether through error or presumption, so shall his
punishment be; though some understand this, as Kimchi, of the Lord's
doing good in a providential way, to the wise and unwise, the righteous
and the wicked: the words are by some rendered to another sense, "a
great one grieveth all, and he hireth the fool, and he hireth the
transgressors" (y); that is, a great man, a tyrannical prince, grieves
all his good subjects; or, as Hottinger (z), from the use of the word in
the Arabic tongue, changes all things, inverts their order, or
administers all at his will, that is, wrongly; when he hires fools and
wicked men to do those bad things for him which others would not, to the
great detriment of the commonwealth; and rewards them for it, putting
them into posts of honour and trust, to the great grief and trouble of
all his best subjects.

[Proverbs 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 26:11</span></span>

As a dog returneth to his vomit,.... Who being sick with what he has
eaten, casts it up again, and afterwards returns unto it and licks it
up;

so a fool returneth to his folly, or "repeats" (a) it, time after time,
many times, as Ben Melech; or a wicked man turns to his wickedness, who,
having had some qualms upon his conscience for sin, for a while forsakes
it; but that fit being over, and he forgetting all his former horror and
uneasiness, returns to his old course of life: a wicked man is here
compared to a dog, as he is elsewhere for his impudence and
voraciousness in sinning; and the filthiness of sin is expressed by the
vomit of a dog, than which nothing is more nauseous and loathsome; and
the apostasy of the sinner, from an external course of righteousness
into open profaneness is signified by the return of this creature to it.
This is said to be a "true proverb", [Pe2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022.md), where it is quoted and applied.

[Proverbs 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 26:12</span></span>

Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit,.... Or "in his own eyes" (b);
as multitudes may be seen, by looking round; man is a creature but of
small knowledge in things natural, civil, mechanical, philosophical,
moral, or divine; yet greatly conceited for the most part of his
knowledge and wisdom. As by a "fool" in this book is generally
understood a wicked profane man, so by a wise man is meant a good and
righteous man, and may be so understood here; and many there are who are
good and righteous only their own conceit and esteem, not truly so; they
place their righteousness in outward things, in the observance of
external duties; and though there may be some little imperfection in
them, yet they think, as they mean well, God will accept the will for
the deed: and some have imagined they have arrived to perfection; and
such are generally conceited, proud, and haughty, and despise others;
all which flows from ignorance; for, though they fancy themselves to be
wise, they are very ignorant of themselves; of the plague of their own
hearts; of the law of God, and the spirituality of it, and the
extensiveness of its demands; of the strict justice and righteousness of
God, which will not admit of an imperfect righteousness in the room of a
perfect one; and also of the righteousness of Jesus Christ, the nature
and necessity of that to justify: and this being their case, they are in
very dangerous circumstances; they are building on a sand; they are
liable to fall into a ditch; they cannot be justified nor saved by their
own works; they oppose themselves to God's way of justifying and saving
sinners; and he sets himself against them, he resisteth the proud.
Wherefore

there is more hope of a fool than of him; of a profane sinner than of a
self-righteous person; for Christ came to save sinners, to call them to
repentance, and he receives them as such; but not self-righteous
persons; and, humanly speaking, there is a greater likelihood and
greater hopes of convincing sinners, and bringing them to repentance and
to forsake their sins, than there is of convincing a self-righteous man
of the insufficiency of his righteousness, and the folly of trusting to
it, and of bringing him to repent of such a confidence, and to forsake
it; for it is most natural to him; it is his own, and the effect of
great labour and pains; and encourages vanity and boasting, which would
be excluded should he part with it; see [Mat
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#031.md).

\(b\) "in oculis suis", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius & Tremellius, &c.

[Proverbs 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 26:13</span></span>

The slothful man saith,.... Within himself; or to such that excite him
to diligence and industry, to go about the business of his calling, to
till his field, and dress his vineyard. The Septuagint and Arabic
versions add, "being sent into the way"; ordered by his master to go out
to work, when he makes the following excuse:

there is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets; in the way to his
field or vineyard, and in the streets, where his business lies or leads
unto it: a very idle excuse this; since lions are usually in woods,
forests, and desert places, and not in public roads, and much less in
streets of cities; see [Pro 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#013.md).
This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion; the
"way" and "streets" may denote public ordinances, which are the ways of
God's appointing, prescribing, and directing to; and in which good men
walk, and find pleasure and profit; and are the streets where Wisdom
cries, or Christ is preached, and where he is sought for and found: but
many are the excuses some men make not to attend them; see [Luk
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#017.md); though they are vain,
frivolous, and foolish, as this here; for in these ways and streets may
true seen the feet of the messengers of peace; here the turtle's voice,
the joyful sound of salvation by Christ, may be heard; here the Lamb of
God is directed to, to be looked at, as taking away the sins of men,
having been slain, and having shed his blood for the redemption of them:
and though the terrible voice of the law may be sometimes heard, which
is necessary to arouse and awaken sleepy sinners, and unhinge
self-righteous persons from a dependence on the works of the law; yet,
afterwards comes the still small voice of the Gospel, proclaiming
freedom from the curse and condemnation of the law by Christ. Indeed, in
some ages, there have been violent persecutors, comparable to lions; and
informers have been in the way and in the streets, to terrify saints
from their duty; but none of these could move them from it, nor separate
fully gracious souls from their love to Christ: though carnal slothful
professors are offended, when tribulation or persecution arise because
of the word, these are lions to them; and, in times of peace and
liberty, they can paint lions, very terrible to themselves, and raise
such difficulties as are insuperable to them; a slight disorder of body,
a small inclemency of the weather, little danger of catching cold, and
the like, shall be a lion to them: not considering they have a devouring
lion nearer them in their houses, chambers, and on their beds with them;
even Satan, in whose clutches they are, who keeps their goods in peace,
by whom they are led captive, and to whom they fall a prey: nor fearing
the wrath of the King of kings, which is as the roaring of a lion: the
wrath of God and of the Lamb, who is also the Lion of the tribe of
Judah, and whose day of wrath will be such as none will be able to bear.

[Proverbs 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 26:14</span></span>

As the door turneth upon his hinges,.... And moves this way and that
way, and opens and shuts, and yet hangs where it did, is not moved from
its place:

so doth the slothful upon his bed; he turns himself from side to side,
but is still on his bed, and does not move out of it, and go about his
business. Aben Ezra makes mention of another reading and sense, "the
door turneth upon his hinges", and is opened to let men out, one and
another, to his work; "but yet the slothful man is upon his bed"; though
one and another rise and go about business, and he hears the door open
again and again, he stirs not, but keeps his, bed. So profane sinners
lie on the bed of sinful lusts and sensual pleasures, indulge themselves
in chambering and wantonness, and do not care to rise from hence, and
walk honestly as in the daytime; and though their consciences are
sometimes jogged by inward pricks, and they are moved a little by the
reproofs of their friends, or awakened by the judgments of God; yet
these are quickly over, and they give themselves a turn and go to sleep
again: sometimes there are some motions in them, some thoughts and
resolutions of amendment, some purposes to do good works; but, alas!
their slothfulness is so great, and the habits and customs of sin so
strong, that they cannot break through them, shake off their sloth, and
come out, but remain as they were: and so it is with carnal professors,
resting in their own works, and in a round of duties; and after ten,
twenty, thirty years' profession, or more, they are just where they
were; have no spiritual knowledge, judgment, and experience.

[Proverbs 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 26:15</span></span>

The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom,.... To keep it warm; Jarchi's
note is,

"he puts his hand in a hot basin, because of the cold.''

The word (c) for "bosom" does sometimes signify a "pot" or basin. Or he
hides it under his "arm holes", as some render it, not caring to make
use of it for labour; or covers it out of sight in his bosom, pretending
some weakness or ailment in it, which hinders him from working; see [Pro
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#024.md);

it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth; from under his arm
holes, or out of his bosom, or even out of the platter, where his food
is; an hyperbolical expression, setting forth his excessive sloth; and
such an one ought not to eat, but starve indeed. It may be rendered, "he
is weary"; it is a "weariness" (d) to him; it is even a labour too much
for him to feed himself, so great is his sloth: and such is the sloth of
carnal men; it is a weariness to them to hear the word, and attend on
ordinances, and to lift up their hands in prayer to God; or to make use
of any means, that they may have food for their souls; praying, hearing,
and reading, are a burden to them; and therefore it is but just with God
to send them a famine of the word, and take away the whole stay and
staff of bread and water.

[Proverbs 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 26:16</span></span>

The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit,.... It is a sort of a
solecism, a kind of a contradiction in terms for a sluggard to be wise,
who is so slothful as to make no use of the means of getting wisdom and
knowledge. And it must be a mere conceit in him that he is wise, and
especially that he is wiser

than seven men that can render a reason; not alluding to the number of a
king's counsellors, who return him an answer to what he inquires of
them, as Aben Ezra thinks; such as were the "seven" princes of the king
of Persia, [Est 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#014.md). Since to have
such an exact number might not obtain in Solomon's time, either in
Persia, or in his own court, or elsewhere: but it signifies a large
number, many wise men, as Gersom observes, that render a reason to
everyone that asks it of them; who, having been diligent and
industrious, have got such a competency of knowledge, that they are able
to give a proper reason of what they say, believe, or do: and such are
they, who, by the blessing of grace in the use of means, are wise in a
spiritual sense; know themselves, and Christ Jesus, and the way of
salvation by him; have an understanding of the Scriptures, and of the
doctrines of the Gospel; have their spiritual senses exercised, to
discern between truth and error; are of established judgments, and
capable of teaching others good judgment and knowledge; and of giving a
reason of their faith, hope, and practice; see [Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md). Now such is the conceit of an
ignorant sluggard, that he is wiser than ten thousand or ever so many of
these; he thinks himself the wisest man, inasmuch as he enjoys ease and
quiet in his stupid sottish way, while they are toiling and labouring,
and taking a great deal of pains to get knowledge; and that he sleeps in
a whole skin, and escapes the censure and reproaches of men, which they
endure for being precise in religious duties, and constant in the
performance of them; and fancies he can get to heaven in an easier way,
without all this care and toil and trouble, only by saying, Lord, have
mercy on me, at last.

[Proverbs 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 26:17</span></span>

He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him,....
One that going along the streets, and passing by the door, where two or
more persons are quarrelling, and he thrusts himself in and intermeddles
in the affair he has no concern in; and interests himself in the cause
of the quarrel he has nothing to do with, on account of acquaintance,
relation, or office; and especially when, instead of being a mediator
and peacemaker, he takes on one side, and acts the angry part, as Aben
Ezra interprets the word rendered "meddleth"; blows things up into a
greater flame, and enrages the one against the other. Such a man

is like one that taketh a dog by the ears; which are short, and
difficult to be held, and tender; and therefore cannot bear to be held
by them, especially to be pulled and lugged by them, and which is very
provoking; and as such a man has work enough to do to hold him, so he is
in danger of being bitten by him, at least when he is forced to let go
his hold: and so it is with a man that interferes in a quarrel in a
furious manner; it is much if one or other of the contending parties do
not fall upon him and abuse him. The Septuagint and Arabic versions
render it, "as he that holdeth the tail of a dog."

[Proverbs 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 26:18</span></span>

As a mad man, who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death. Or the
instruments of death, as Aben Ezra; or the sharp arrows of death, as the
Targum and Syriac version; who casts firebrands into the houses and
barns of his neighbours, to consume them; or arrows at their persons and
cattle, to destroy them; or any other instruments of death, which none
but a mad man, or one wickedly mad, would do. Or, "as one that makes
himself mad" (e); that feigns himself mad, and, under colour of this,
does mischief to his neighbour's person and property: or, "as one that
hides himself" (f); that casts firebrands, arrows, and other deadly
things, in a private way, so as not to be seen, and that it may not be
known from whence they come: or, "as one that wearies himself" (g), so
Jarchi; in doing mischief in such a way. The word in the Arabic language
signifies to play and be in sport; and so it means one that does these
things in sport, as it is a sport to a fool to do mischief; which sense
agrees with what follows.

insanire fingit", Cocceius. (f) "Sicut abscondit se", Pagninus,

[Proverbs 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 26:19</span></span>

So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour,.... By telling him a lie; or
by reporting false things concerning him; or by cheating him in trade
and commerce; or by taking his goods privately from him; and, when
caught in either of these,

and saith, Am not I in sport? do not be angry, I designed no hurt; it is
all in jest, a mere joke: but, had he not been apprehended, it would
have been in earnest, as he was. This is only an excuse, and as absurd
an one as if a man should set fire to his neighbour's house and barns,
or throw arrows at him, or strike him with any instrument of death, as
the sword, &c. and then say he was only in jest, or pretend madness.

[Proverbs 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 26:20</span></span>

Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out,.... Or "woods" (h); where
there is a large quantity of wood or fuel, the fire is kept up; but
where there is little, scarce any or none at all, it goes out of course;

So where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth; or is silent (i):
men cease to quarrel one with another; they hold their peace and are
silent, when there are none to bring tales from one to another, or any
whisperer or backbiter to suggest evil things of each other; or when
such are discouraged on both sides, and their tales are not listened to;
or when they are detected and thrust out of doors, as they deserve, then
strife subsides, and peace ensues. Contention is like a fire, the flame
of which is blown up by talebearers and whisperers, who are as
incendiaries, and as such are to be treated.

[Proverbs 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 26:21</span></span>

As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire,.... As brands, wood
half burnt, or dead coals put to live and burning ones, soon take fire
and become like them, and fit and proper fuel for them, and add to their
heat:

so is a contentious man to kindle strife; or "a man of contentions" (k);
who is given to it, is full of it; it is agreeable to his natural temper
and disposition; he is in his element when at it; such a man is as fuel
to the fire, as a dead coal to a living one, which increases the heat of
it; so does he, he kindles and spreads the flame of contention and
strife.

[Proverbs 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 26:22</span></span>

The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the
innermost parts of the belly. These expressions are the same with those
in [Pro 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008.md); and are here repeated,
as being found along with others by the men of Hezekiah, [Pro
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md); as some others likewise are; and
also because of the importance of them; and to impress the minds of men
with a sense of the evil of such a practice, that they may shun it, and
avoid those that are given to it. See Gill on [Pro
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008.md).

[Proverbs 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 26:23</span></span>

Burning lips, and a wicked heart,.... Either burning with wrath and
malice; breathing out threatenings and slaughter; pursuing men with
reproaches and slanders, arising from a wicked heart: or rather, burning
with profession of love to God, and affection to good men; with great
pretensions of kindness, and promises of good things, when their hearts
are wicked, and they design noticing less; say one thing with their
lips, with the greatest show of affection and sincerity, and mean
another in their hearts. These

are like a potsherd covered with silver dross: which at a distance, or
to less discerning persons, looks like silver, and is taken for it; when
the covering is only dross, and what is within is only a potsherd, Or a
piece of an earthen vessel, good for nothing: such are the specious
professions and deceitful words, which flow from a wicked heart.

[Proverbs 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 26:24</span></span>

He that hateth dissembleth with his lips,.... He that bears a grudge in
his mind, and retains hatred in his heart against any person, hides it
all he can, till he has an opportunity of showing it as he would; he
pretends a great deal of friendship with his lips, that his hatred might
not be known; he would be thought to be a friend, when he is really an
enemy; he does not choose as yet to make himself known what he is. Some
render it to a sense the reverse, "the enemy", or "he that hateth, is
known by his lips" (l); so the Targum, Vulgate Latin, and Syriac
versions: if you carefully watch him, mark his words, and observe what
he says, you will find out the hatred that lies in his heart; he cannot
forbear saying something, at one time or another, which betrays the
malignity of his mind;

and layeth up deceit within him; or, "though (m) he layeth up", &c.
hides it as much as he can, yet it will show itself in some way or
another.

[Proverbs 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 26:25</span></span>

When he speaketh fair, believe him not,.... Gives good words, flatters
with his lips, pretends great kindness and favour, expresses himself in
a very gracious and amiable manner, in order to gain attention and
respect; or when he delivers himself in a submissive and suppliant way,
with great humility and deference; or in a mournful and pitiful strain,
as if he had the most tender affection and concern; be not too
credulous; do not suffer yourselves to be imposed upon by him; be upon
your guard, distrust him, suspect a snake in the grass;

for there are seven abominations in his heart; a multitude of wicked
purposes, schemes, and designs, which he has formed there against you,
and which he only waits a proper time to put in execution; things
abominable to God and men. Aben Ezra thinks reference is had to the
seven abominations in [Pro 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016.md).

[Proverbs 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 26:26</span></span>

Whose hatred is covered by deceit,.... The hatred of whose heart is
covered by deceitful words, and strong expressions of love and esteem;
so that those to whom they are made are deceived by them. Or, whose
"hatred is covered in a waste or desert place" (n); it being not seen;
as what is done in desert places is not obvious to view, being little
frequented; which agrees with what follows, and keeps up the antithesis
between the two clauses: Schultens renders it, with a tumultuous noise,
with loud and public acclamations; see [Zac
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007.md);

his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation; in an open
court of judicature, where he shall be brought, arraigned, and tried for
his wickedness; which, though covertly done, shall be exposed and proved
upon him: or before the church of God, where he shall be convicted by
the word, and be obliged to acknowledge his sin; and, in a member, be
reproved before all, and rejected: or however, at the great day of
judgment, before angels and men, when all will be convened together; and
where every secret work will be brought, and will be brought to light,
and receive its just reward.

vastatione", Tigurine version; "in vastitate", Mercerus, Piscator, so

[Proverbs 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 26:27</span></span>

Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein,.... That devises mischief
against others, it shall come upon himself. The allusion is to the
digging of pits for catching wild beasts, which are slightly covered
with earth; and which sometimes the pursuers, through inadvertency, fall
into themselves; the passage seems to be taken from [Psa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md);

and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him; that rolls a stone
up hill, if he does not take care, it will return back, and fall with
great force upon himself; so the mischief which a wicked man labours
hard at, as men do in digging a pit, or rolling a stone, in time rolls
back upon themselves; the measure they mete out to others is measured to
them. Jarchi makes mention of an "hagadah", or exposition, which
illustrates this passage, by the case of Abimelech; who slew threescore
and ten persons on one stone, and was himself killed with a piece of a
millstone cast upon him, [Jdg 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#018.md);
this may put in mind of the fable of Sisyphus (o), feigned in hell to
roll a great stone to the top of a mountain, which presently falling
down on his head, made his labour fruitless.

[Proverbs 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 26:28</span></span>

A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it,.... That is, a man
of a lying tongue, that is given to lying, hates those that are hurt and
crushed by his lies; the reason why he hurts them with his lies is
because he hates them; and, having hurt them, he hates them, being made
his enemies, and from whom he may expect and be in fear of revenge:
moreover, he hates those that are troubled at and disturbed with his
lies; or the "contrite" (p) and humble men: or those who "smite" or
"strike" (q) him, as some render the word, actively; that is, reprove
him, and bring him to shame for lying. The words are by some translated,
a "contrite" person, or everyone of "the contrite ones, hateth a lying
tongue" (r); such as are of a broken and of a contrite spirit, and that
tremble at the word of God, or are hurt by lies, these abhor a liar. The
Targum is,

"a lying tongue bates the ways of truth;''

and the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, render it, "a lying
tongue hate truth"; and so the Vulgate Latin version, "a lying tongue
loves not truth"; for nothing is more contrary to a lie than truth;

and a flattering mouth worketh ruin; both to itself and to the persons
flattered by it: or, "makes an impulse" (s); a pushing, a driving away;
it drives away such as cannot bear its flatteries: and pushes on such
that are taken with it, both into sin and into ruin.
