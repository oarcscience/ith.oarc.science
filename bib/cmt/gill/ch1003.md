### [1 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 3:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 3

This chapter gives an account of the sons of David, born to him both in
Hebron and in Jerusalem, [Ch1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001), and
of his successors in the kingdom, to the Babylonish captivity, [Ch1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010), and of his family, to the coming
of the Messiah, [Ch1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017).

[1 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 3:1</span></span>

Now these were the sons of David,.... The six following born in Hebron,
who are reckoned in the same order as in [Sa2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#002), only here the second son is
called Daniel, who there goes by the name of Chileab; he had two names,
the reason of which see there; and here David's wife, Eglah, is said in
the Targum to be Michal, Saul's daughter; see Gill on [Sa2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#005), to which is added an account of
his reign both in Hebron and Jerusalem, agreeably to [Sa2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#005).

[1 Chronicles 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 3:5</span></span>

And these were born unto him in Jerusalem,.... Whose names follow, in
all nine; there are but seven mentioned in [Sa2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014) the reason of which see in the
notes there; See Gill on [Sa2 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014).
See Gill on [Sa2 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#015). See Gill on
[Sa2 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#016). it may be observed that
Bathsheba is here called Bathshua, and her father Ammiel, whose name is
Eliam in [Sa2 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003), names of much the
same signification.

[1 Chronicles 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 3:9</span></span>

These were all the sons of David,.... By his wives:

beside the sons of the concubines; who are not reckoned, and how many
they were is not known; he had ten concubines at least, [Sa2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#016) and [Sa2
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#003).

And Tamar their sister; not the sister of the sons of the concubines,
but of his other sons, and only of Absalom by the mother's side, of whom
see [Sa2 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 3:10</span></span>

And Solomon's son was Rehoboam,.... From hence to the end of the
fourteenth verse, David's successors are reckoned, according to the
order of their reign, unto Josiah and his sons:

Solomon, Rehoboam, Abia, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joram, Ahaziah, Joash,
Amaziah, Azariah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon, Josiah, in all
sixteen.

[1 Chronicles 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 3:15</span></span>

And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan,.... Of whom we
nowhere else read; he probably died before his father Josiah:

the second Jehoiakim: whose name was Eliakim, changed for the former by
the king of Egypt, when, he deposed his younger brother, and set him on
the throne, [Kg2 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024).

the third Zedekiah; whose name was Mattaniah, but changed by the king of
Babylon, when he placed him on the throne in the room of his brother's
son, [Kg2 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017),

the fourth Shallum: the same with Jehoahaz, who was first made king in
the room of his father; but reigning so short a time, and making so mean
a figure, is mentioned last, see [Jer
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011).

[1 Chronicles 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 3:16</span></span>

And the sons of Jehoiakim; Jeconiah his son, Zedekiah his son. This is
not the Zedekiah mentioned in the preceding verse; for he was not the
son but the uncle of Jeconiah, unless he should be called his son
because he succeeded him in the kingdom; but he seems to be another of
that name, nowhere else mentioned, and not the son of Jeconiah in any
sense; he is not reckoned among them in the following verses, but of
Jehoiakim.

[1 Chronicles 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 3:17</span></span>

And the sons of Jeconiah,.... For though he was pronounced childless,
[Jer 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030), that respects not his
having no children in any sense, but none to succeed him in the kingdom:

Assir; which signifies bound, or a prisoner, because, as Kimchi thinks,
he was born in a prison, his father then being a captive in Babylon; but
rather it refers to Jeconiah himself, and is an appellation of him, and
to be rendered:

the sons of Jeconiah the captive: which agrees best with the Hebrew
accents:

Salathiel his son; the same that is called Shealtiel, [Hag
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001) who was both the proper son of
Jeconiah, and who succeeded him, as some think, in the honour and
dignity the king of Babylon raised him to.

[1 Chronicles 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 3:18</span></span>

Malchiram also,.... That is, was a son of Jeconiah as well as Salathiel,
and so the rest that follow:

and Pedaiah, and Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah; Kimchi says
these were the sons of Salathiel; but I rather think they were the sons
of Jeconiah, and brethren of Salathiel, because of what follows.

[1 Chronicles 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 3:19</span></span>

And the sons of Pedaiah were, Zerubbabel and Shimei,.... Here arises a
difficulty, since elsewhere Zerubbabel is said to be the son of
Shealtiel, [Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001) some think this is
not the same Zerubbabel here as there; so Grotius (u); but I see no
reason for that; but this difficulty may be removed by observing, that
if Pedaiah was a son of Salathiel, as Kimchi thinks, then Zerubbabel,
being his grandson, may be called his son, as grandsons are sometimes
called sons in Scripture; or rather, Salathiel, having no children,
adopted Zerubbabel, his brother's son, and made him successor in the
government; so that he was the son of Pedaiah by birth, and of Salathiel
by adoption; or else Salathiel dying without children, his brother
Pedaiah, according to the law, married his widow, and by her had
Zerubbabel, who was the proper son of Pedaiah, and the legal son of
Salathiel:

and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam: who is called Abiud, [Mat
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#013) another son of his, with their
father, is mentioned in this verse, and five more in the next. From
hence to the end of the chapter, the genealogy is carried on from the
captivity of Babylon, out of which Zerubbabel came, to the coming of
Christ; and if Ezra was the writer of this book, as is generally
thought, who was contemporary with Zerubbabel, this account must be
written by another hand: and it may be observed, that it is carried on
in the same number of generations as in Matthew; and here it stands
thus:

Zerubbabel, Hananiah, Jesaiah, Rephaiah, Arnan, Obadiah, Shecaniah,
Shemaiah, Neariah, Elioenai, Anani; in Matthew thus, "Zerubbabel, Abiud,
Eliakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, Jacob, Joseph";
the difference in names may be accounted for by their having two names;
and it is remarkable that the Targum makes Anani to be the King Messiah,
who was to be revealed; which, though it makes one generation less to
his time, yet plainly shows that the Jews expected the Messiah to come
at the end of this genealogy, and about the time Jesus the true Messiah
did. Anani is reckoned by other Jews a name of the Messiah, who is said
to come in the clouds of heaven, which "Anani" signifies; see Gill on
[Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013).
