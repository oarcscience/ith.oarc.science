INTRODUCTION TO 2 KINGS 15

This chapter begins with the reign of Azariah king of Judah, [Kg2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md), and then gives a short account
of the several kings of Israel, to the last of them; of Zachariah, [Kg2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008.md), of Shallum, [Kg2
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#013.md) of Menahem, [Kg2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016.md) of Pekahiah, [Kg2
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#023.md), of Pekah, succeeded by Hoshea,
the last of them, [Kg2 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#027.md), and is
included with the reign of Jotham king of Judah, [Kg2
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 15:1</span></span>

In the twenty amd seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah
the son on Amaziah king of Judah to reign. Now Amaziah lived only to the
fifteenth year of Jeroboam, [Kg2 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#002.md)
in which year, and not in his twenty seventh, it might be thought
Azariah his son began to reign. There are various ways taken to remove
this difficulty, not to take notice of a corruption of numbers, "twenty
seven for seventeen", which some insist on. Ben Gersom and Abarbinel are
of opinion, that those twenty seven years of Jeroboam's reign are not to
be understood of what were past, but of what were to come before the
family of Jehu was extinct; and that he reigned twenty six years, and
his son six months, which made twenty seven imperfect years. Others
suppose that Jeroboam reigned with his father eleven or twelve years
before his death; and, reckoning from the different periods of his
reign, this was either the twenty seventh year, or the fifteenth or
sixteenth: and others, that the reign of Azariah may be differently
reckoned, either from the time his father fled to Lachish, where he
might remain eleven or twelve years, or from his death, and so may be
said to begin to reign either in the fifteenth or twenty seventh of
Jeroboam; or there was an interregnum of eleven or twelve years after
the death of his father, he being a minor of about four years of age,
which was the fifteenth of Jeroboam, during which time the government
was in the hands of the princes and great men of the nation; and it was
not till Azariah was sixteen years of age, and when it was the twenty
seventh of Jeroboam's reign, that the people agreed to make him king,
see [Kg2 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md) and which seems to be
the best way of accounting for it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 15:2</span></span>

Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign,.... By the consent of
the people and princes of Judah, [Kg2
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md).

and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: exclusive of the eleven
or twelve years of his minority, from his father's death:

and his mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem; of whom there is no
further account any where.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 15:3</span></span>

And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord,.... At the
beginning of his reign, and in an external way:

according to all that his father Amaziah had done; who did not do what
he did as David, sincerely and cordially, [Kg2
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#003.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 15:4</span></span>

Save that the high places were not removed,.... That is, he did right,
excepting in that instance, and which was the case of his father and
other kings before him, and others afterwards, till Hezekiah came:

the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places; see
[Kg2 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#003.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 15:5</span></span>

And the Lord smote the king,.... With leprosy; the reason of it was,
because he intruded into the priest's office, and went into the temple
to burn incense on the altar of incense, [Ch2
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#019.md),

so that he was a leper unto the day of his death; but how long it was to
it from his being smitten cannot be said with certainty; Dr. Lightfoot
(l) thinks he died the same year he was smitten:

and dwelt in a several house: without Jerusalem, as the Targum; for
lepers, according to the law, were to dwell separate without the camp or
city, [Lev 13:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#046.md) the word for
"several" signifies "free" (m); here he lived alone, free from the
company and conversation of men, free from the business of government,
his son doing that for him, and in the country, where he might freely
walk about, as lepers did, and take the air; the Jews say (n), his house
was among the graves, where he was free among the dead, as the phrase
is, [Psa 88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005.md), but not likely; much
better is what Abendana observes from R. Jonah, that the word, in the
Arabic (o) language, signifies a little house, and so this might be in
which he dwelt out of the city, in comparison of his palace:

and Jotham the king's son was over the house; had the direction of the
palace, and the management of all affairs in it:

judging the people of the land; administering justice in all cases, for
which they came to him, and so filled up his father's place; he did not
depose his father, nor take upon him to be king, only did the business
of one.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 15:6</span></span>

And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? In the
history of the reigns of those kings; some of them are recorded in the
canonical book of the Chronicles, [Ch2
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md) and some were written by the
prophet Isaiah, [Ch2 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#022.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 15:7</span></span>

So Azariah slept with his fathers,.... Or died, when he had reigned
fifty two years:

and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David; but not in
the sepulchres of the kings, but in the field of the burial, or the
burying ground which belonged to them, because he was a leper, [Ch2
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#023). Benjamin of Tudela (p.md) places
his grave near the pillar of Absalom, and the fountain of Siloah, near
the brook Kidron:

and Jotham his son reigned in his stead; who reigned sixteen years; a
further account of him, and his reign, we have in the latter part of
this chapter, after the reigns of several of the kings of Israel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 15:8</span></span>

In the thirty eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son
of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months. Since Azariah began
to reign in the twenty seventh of Jeroboam, [Kg2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md), and Jeroboam reigned forty one
years, [Kg2 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md), his last year must
be the fifteenth or sixteenth of Azariah, in which year Zachariah must
have begun to reign, had he immediately succeeded his father in the
throne; there must be therefore an interregnum of twenty two years at
least, which might be owing to the dissensions among the princes and
people about the succession, and a dislike to Zachariah on some account;
however, after all, he must reign, though but six months, to fulfil the
word of the Lord, see [Kg2 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#012.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 15:9</span></span>

Even all his predecessors, from the time of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
from whose sin, in worshipping the calves, they departed not.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 15:10</span></span>

And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him,.... A friend of
his, as Josephus (q) calls him, encouraged by the dissatisfaction of the
people to him:

and smote him before the people, and slew him; in a public manner, the
people consenting to it, and approving of it, not liking Zachariah to be
their king:

and reigned in his stead; though but a very short time.

\(q\) Antiqu. l. 9. c. 11. sect. 1.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 15:11</span></span>

And the rest of the acts of Zachariah,.... During his six months' reign,
and what he might do before in the interregnum:

behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel: for be they more or fewer, good or bad, they were all recorded
there which were of any moment.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 15:12</span></span>

This was the word of the Lord which he spake unto Jehu,.... Which was
now fulfilled in the short reign of Zachariah:

saying, thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth
generation; see [Kg2 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030.md), and so it
came to pass; as every word of the Lord does, not one fails; for after
Jehu reigned Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam the second, and Zachariah, all
descendants of Jehu.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 15:13</span></span>

Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year
of Uzziah king of Judah,.... The same with Azariah: he is sometimes
called by one name, and sometimes by the other, see [Kg2
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md),

and he reigned a full month in Samaria: and no longer; so soon were the
conspiracy against his sovereign, and the murder of him, punished.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 15:14</span></span>

For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah,.... A city in the tribe
of Manasseh, the royal city of the kings of Israel before Omri, of which
See Gill on [Jos 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#024.md), whether
Menahem was of this city, or was now besieging it with an army he had
the command of, as Josephus (r) suggests, is not certain; however,
hearing what had befallen Zachariah, he came from hence: and came to
Samaria; which, according to Bunting (s), was six miles from Tirzah:

and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and
reigned in his stead; judging he had as good a right to the throne as
Shallum had.

\(r\) Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 9. c. 11. sect. 1.) (s) Travels, &c. p. 169.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 15:15</span></span>

And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made,
behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel. In which, no doubt, an account of the cause of the conspiracy,
and of the persons assisting to him in it, was given, with other things
done in his short reign.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 15:16</span></span>

Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts
thereof from Tirzah,.... The Jewish writers commonly take this Tiphsah
to be without the land of Israel, the same with that in [Kg1
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024.md) on the borders of Syria, and near
the Euphrates; but it seems to be some place nearer Samaria, and Tirzah;
according to Bunting (t), it was but six miles from Samaria:

because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; they refused to
open the gates of their city to him, and receive him, and acknowledge
him as their king; therefore he exercised severity on the inhabitants of
it, and the parts adjacent, as far as Tirzah, putting them to the sword:

and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up: which was a
most shocking instance of barbarity, and which he did, to terrify others
from following their example. Ben Gersom interprets it of strong towers
built on mountains, which he demolished, deriving "haroth", which we
render "women with child", from "a mountain".

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 15:17</span></span>

In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem
the son of Gadi to reign over Israel,.... Shallum reigning but one
month, both their reigns began the same year.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 15:18</span></span>

And he did that which was evil,.... The same character is given of him
as of those before him, [Kg2 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#009.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 15:19</span></span>

And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land,.... The land of
Israel, he invaded it; a Jewish chronologer (u) calls him Pulbelicho;
and he is generally thought to be the same with Belochus or Belesis,
governor of Babylon, who, with Arbaces the Mede, slew Sardanapalus, said
to be the last of the Assyrian kings, and translated the empire to the
Chaldeans; he ruling over Babylon and Nineveh, and Arbaces over the
Medes and Persians; but Pul was not a Babylonian, but an Assyrian (w),
and the first king of the Assyrians, at least, the Scriptures speak of:
we read no more of him; but one Metasthenes, a Persian historian,
feigned and published by Annius, and so named by him instead of
Megasthenes, calls him Phulbelochus, and says (x) he reigned forty eight
years:

and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver; and a talent of
silver, according to Brerewood (y) was three hundred and seventy five
pounds; but Bishop Cumberland (z) calculates it at three hundred and
fifty three pounds eleven shillings and ten pence half penny; 1,000 of
them made a large sum of money, according to the former 375,000 pounds;
and this he gave to him, not only to desist from the invasion of his
land, but

that his hand might be with him; and not against him:

and to confirm the kingdom in his hand; which being got by usurpation,
and supported by cruelty, was but tottering.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 15:20</span></span>

And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of
wealth,.... Who were most able to pay it, by which means he eased the
poor, and might thereby attach them to him:

of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria:
that is, he required them to pay fifty shekels apiece to make up the
above sum as a present to Pul; though the words in the original text lie
more naturally thus, "to give to the king of Assyria fifty shekels of
silver for one man"; that is, for every man in his army; which amounted
to about six pounds a man:

so the king of Assyria turned back; to his own country:

and stayed not there in the land; in the land of Israel, neither to
distress nor to help Menahem, for which he gave him the money.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 15:21</span></span>

And the rest of the acts of Menahem,.... We are referred to the same
book of chronicles for them as for those of the rest of the kings, which
seems to be a form the historian uses of them all.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 15:22</span></span>

And Menahem slept with his fathers,.... Died a natural death, and in
peace, though an usurper and a tyrant:

and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead; the kingdom he had usurped
continued in his family.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 15:23</span></span>

In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of
Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria,.... As it was in the
thirty ninth of Azariah that his father began his reign, and he reigned
ten years, they must end in the forty ninth of Azariah, and therefore
there must be an interregnum of a year; perhaps the title of Pekahiah
might be disputed, and it was a year before he could get settled on the
throne:

and reigned two years; being slain by one of his captains, as after
related.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 15:24</span></span>

And he did that which was evil,.... Besides other sins, he cleaved to
that of worshipping the calves, a piece of state policy all the kings of
Israel gave into.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 15:25</span></span>

But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his,.... The word signifies
a "third" man, the third to the king, as some think; Josephus (a) calls
him a "chiliarch", one that had the command of a thousand men:

conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the
king's house; Josephus (b) says it was at a banquet:

with Argob, and Arieh; whom, according to Abarbinel, Pekah slew with the
king, being mighty men, who were always about him; but they seem rather
to be conspirators with Pekah, and assisting to him in smiting the king;
the former of these, Ben Gersom thinks, was governor of Argob, a country
on the other side Jordan, and the latter had his name from his
fortitude, which signifies a lion:

and with him fifty men of the Gileadites; which may seem to strengthen
the above notion concerning Argob, since the Gileadites were of the same
side of Jordan, and were near Argob, see [Deu
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013.md).

and he killed him, and reigned in his room, as his father killed
Shallum, and reigned in his stead.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 15:26</span></span>

And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah,.... The same form of expression is
used as before, [Kg2 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#021.md), of all the
kings.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 15:27</span></span>

In the fifty second year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of
Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria,.... Which was the last
year of the reign of Azariah:

and reigned twenty years; which was a long reign for an usurper and
murderer.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 15:28</span></span>

And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,.... Not only in
committing the above crimes of usurpation and murder, but idolatry, and
particularly the worshipping of the calves, hinted at in the text.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 15:29</span></span>

In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of
Assyria,.... Into the land of Israel; he is called by a Jewish
chronologer (c), Pul-Asir; so Phul-Assar by Metasthenes (d), who says he
reigned twenty five years; he very probably was the son of Pul the
Assyrian king, mentioned [Kg2 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md),
and is thought to be the same that Aelianus (e) calls Tilgamos; some
think he had the first part of his name from Diglath, or Diglito, by
which the river Tigris is called in Pliny (f), with which Assyria was
washed; and that Pil, or Pul, is Baal, Bel, Jupiter, and Azar is Mars
(g); of all which his name is composed:

and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah; of which see [Kg1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020.md),

and Janoah; a city in the tribe of Ephraim, [Jos
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006.md).

and Kedesh, and Hazor; cities in Naphtali: [Jos
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#036.md).

and Gilead; a country beyond Jordan, which belonged to the Reubenites,
Gadites, and half tribe of Manasseh:

and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; that is, upper Galilee, which lay
in Naphtali:

and carried them captive to Assyria; which was the first captivity of
Israel in which half their tribes were carried away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 15:30</span></span>

And Hoshea the son or Elab made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of
Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead,.... Did
by him as he had done by Pekahiah, [Kg2
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#028.md), this was measure for measure,
as the Jews say: and this he did

in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah; and yet Jotham is
said to reign but sixteen years, [Kg2
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#033.md), this must be reckoned therefore
either from the time of his being viceroy, and judging Israel in his
father's lifetime, [Kg2 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005.md) or this
was the fourth year of Ahaz, and the twentieth year, reckoning from the
time Jotham began to reign, who is the rather mentioned, because as yet
the historian had taken no notice of Ahaz.

And the rest of the acts of Pekah,.... Not recorded here, were to be
read in the book of chronicles of the kings so often referred to.

In the second year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah king of Israel, began
Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign. Pekah began to reign in
the fifty second year of Azariah, or Uzziah, which was his last year,
[Kg2 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#027.md), and which was the first of
Pekah; Uzziah reigned full fifty two, and then Jotham succeeded, which
was the beginning of the second of Pekah.

Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign,.... Alone,
after the death of his father:

and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his reign, upon the
whole, was a good reign:

and his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok; a person well
known in those times; Dr. Lightfoot (h) thinks he was high priest.

And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord,.... Jarchi, in
[Ch2 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002.md), observes, from a writer of
theirs, that in all the kings of Judah before him, even in the best,
some sins were found; but in Jotham there was nothing scandalous and
reproachful; and it is a high character Josephus (i) gives of him, that
there was no virtue wanting in him; he was pious towards God, just
towards men, and careful of the public good; but the inspired historian
chiefly respects matters of religious worship; he did not give into
idolatry:

he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done; that is,
according to what was well done by him; he did not imitate him in going
into the temple to burn incense, which is particularly excepted. [Ch2
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002.md).

Howbeit the high places were not removed,.... As they were not by his
father, and the same is observed of the best of kings before:

the people sacrificed and burnt incense still in the high places; from
which they could not be brought off by prophets or kings:

he built the higher gate of the house of the Lord; which was between the
temple and the king's palace, which led to it; this he repaired and
beautified, or added something to it; or otherwise it was built by
Solomon, and therefore called the new gate, [Jer
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#010.md) it is the same that was
afterwards called the gate of Nicanor; the east gate, as say the Jewish
writers (k).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg2 15:36</span></span>

Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Of which
mention is often made by the inspired historians; some of Jotham's other
acts are recorded in the canonical book of Chronicles, [Ch2
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg2 15:37</span></span>

In those days,.... At the end of the days of Jotham, or after his death,
things might be in design, and preparations made before, but nothing of
what follows came to pass in his life, but in the times of his son:

the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah
the son of Remaliah: to make war with them as a scourge to Ahaz for his
sins; of which is in the following chapter.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg2 15:38</span></span>

And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David his father,.... Died, and was buried with the kings of
Judah in their sepulchres:

and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead; an account of whose reign we have
in the next chapter.
