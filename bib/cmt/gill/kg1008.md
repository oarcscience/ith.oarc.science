INTRODUCTION TO 1 KINGS 8

This chapter gives an account of the introduction of the ark into the
temple, [Kg1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001.md) of the glory of the
Lord filling it, [Kg1 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md) of a speech
Solomon made to the people concerning the building of the temple, and
how he came to be engaged in it, [Kg1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012.md), of a prayer of his he put up on
this occasion, requesting, that what supplications soever were made at
any time, or on any account, by Israelites or strangers, might be
accepted by the Lord, [Kg1 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022.md), and
of his blessing the people of Israel at the close of it, with some
useful exhortations, [Kg1 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054.md), and of
the great number of sacrifices offered up by him, and the feast he made
for the people, upon which he dismissed them, [Kg1
8:62](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 8:1</span></span>

Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel,.... The judges in the
several cities, or senators of the great sanhedrim, as others; though it
is a question whether as yet there was such a court:

and all the heads of the tribes; the princes of the twelve tribes:

the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel; the principal men of
the ancient families in every tribe:

unto King Solomon in Jerusalem; these he summoned together to himself
there where the temple was built:

that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the
city of David, which is Zion; whither David brought it, when he had
taken that fort, so called, and dwelt in it; and from this mountain
Solomon proposed to bring it up to the temple, on a higher mountain,
Moriah, not far from one another.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 8:2</span></span>

And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto King Solomon at the
feast,.... Not of tabernacles, as the Targum on [Ch2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#003.md) and so Jarchi; though that was in
the same month next mentioned, and began on the fifteenth of it, and
held seven days; wherefore this must be the feast of the dedication of
the temple, and which was kept before that; since both lasted fourteen
days, and the people were dismissed on the twenty third of the month;
now not only the above principal persons convened, but a vast number of
the common people came to see the solemnity of removing the ark, and of
dedicating the temple, and to attend the feast of it, and the more,
since in a few days was the time for all the males in Israel to appear
there:

in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month; it was, as the Targum
says, originally the first month; but upon the children of Israel coming
out of Egypt in Ab or Nisan, that became the first month, and this was
the seventh from that; and is the same with Tisri, which answers to part
of September, and part of October, here called Ethanim; which some
render the month of the ancients, others of strong ones; either because
of the many feasts that were in it, as some say; or because it was the
time of ingathering all the increase and fruits of the earth, which
strengthen and support man's life; or rather of "never failing", i.e.
waters, showers falling in this month, and the rivers full of water (l);
so September is "septimus imber", according to Isidore (m), and the
three following months are alike derived; this, by the Egyptians, was
called Theuth, and was with them the first month in the year (n); so
Porphyry says (o), with the Egyptians the beginning of the year was not
Aquarius, as with the Romans, but Cancer; and so the month of September
was the first with the Ethiopians (p), and with most people (q); though
with the Chinese about the middle of Aquarius (r). Now, though the
temple was finished in the eighth month, [Kg1
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038.md), it was not dedicated until the
seventh in the following year; it required time to finish the utensils
and vessels, and put them in their proper place, and for the drying of
the walls, &c.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 8:3</span></span>

And all the elders of Israel came,.... To Zion, the city of David:

and the priests took up the ark; from thence; in [Ch2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#004.md) it is said the Levites did it,
whose business it was, [Deu 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#025.md), and
so the priests might be called; for every priest was a Levite, though
every Levite was not a priest, and the priests did at all times bear the
ark; see [Jos 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 8:4</span></span>

And they brought up the ark of the Lord,.... From the city of David to
the temple:

and the tabernacle of the congregation; not the tent David made for the
ark, though that might be brought also, but the tabernacle of Moses,
which had been many years at Gibeon; but now removed to Zion, and from
thence to the temple, where it was laid up, as having been a sacred
thing; that it might not be put to common or superstitious uses, and to
prevent the being of more places than one for worship:

and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle; as the
candlestick, shewbread table, incense altar, &c.

even those did the priests and the Levites bring up; some brought one,
and some another; the priests brought the ark, and the Levites the
vessels.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 8:5</span></span>

And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were
assembled together,.... On this solemn occasion:

were with him before the ark; while it was in the court of the priests,
before it was carried into the most holy place:

sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for
multitude; the phrase seems to be hyperbolical, and designed to denote a
great number.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 8:6</span></span>

And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his
place,.... Destined for it, the like to which it had in the tabernacle:

into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place; that part of the
house where the divine oracle was, the holy of holies; for though into
it none but the high priest might enter, and he but once a year; yet in
case of necessity, as for the repair of it, which the Jews (s) gather
from hence, other priests might enter, as was the case now; an high
priest could not carry in the ark himself, and therefore it was
necessary to employ others; and besides, as yet the divine Majesty had
not taken up his residence in it:

even under the wings of the cherubim; the large ones which Solomon had
made, [Kg1 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#023.md) not those of Moses.

\(s\) Vid. Maimon. Hilchot Beth Habechirah, c. 7. sect. 23.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 8:7</span></span>

For the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the
ark,.... The most holy place where the ark stood, even from wall to
wall:

and the cherubim covered the ark, and the staves thereof above; so that
neither could be seen.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 8:8</span></span>

And they drew out the staves,.... Not made them larger, as Ben Gersom,
than those in the tabernacle of Moses, this place being larger than
that; nor did they draw them wholly out, and lay them up in the
sanctuary, there being no further use for them, the ark having now a
fixed place, and not to be removed; which would have been contrary to
[Exo 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015.md) but they drew them out some
little way:

that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the
oracle; not in that part of the temple commonly called the holy place,
in distinction from the most holy, for that seems to be denied in the
next clause; nor could they be seen there, since there was a wall and a
vail between them; though some think they might be seen when the door
was opened, and the vail turned aside; and these also pushing against
the vail, might be seen prominent, like the breasts of a woman under a
covering, as the Jews express it; but the sense is, that the ends of
these were seen out of the ark from under the wings of the cherubim,
being a little drawn, in that part of the most holy place which is
before the oracle or mercy seat:

and they were not seen without; neither quite out of the ark, nor
without the most holy place, nor in the holy place; but were only seen
by the high priest when he went in on the day of atonement, and served
as a direction to him to go between them before the ark, and there
perform his work (t); which, through the darkness of the place, and the
ark being covered with the wings of the cherubim, he could not otherwise
discern the exact place where it stood:

and there they are unto this day: when the writer of this book lived,
even in the same situation.

\(t\) Vid. Misn. Yoma, c. 5. sect. 1.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 8:9</span></span>

There was nothing in the ark, save the two tables of stone which Moses
put there at Horeb,.... That is, there were no other writings; or, as
Ben Gersom says, no other part of the law, but the decalogue otherwise
he observes there were in it Aaron's rod and the pot of manna, according
to [Heb 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004.md) though the particle there
may be rendered "at", or "with", or "by"; see Gill on [Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004.md) and so they might be not within
it, but in some place on the sides of it, see [Deu
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026.md),

when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they
came out of the land of Egypt; about two months after.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 8:10</span></span>

And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
place,.... The most holy place, having set up the ark of the Lord there,
who were all sanctified that were there, and did not wait by course as
at other times, see [Ch2 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md), where
in [Ch2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012.md) it is said, that at this
time, the Levites, who were singers of the families of Asaph, Heman, and
Jeduthun, arrayed in fine linen, with their musical instruments in their
hands, stood at the east end of the altar of burnt offering, and one
hundred and twenty priests, blowing their trumpets, praised the Lord
together with one sound, declaring his goodness and his mercy, which
endure for ever: and then it was

that the cloud filled the house of the Lord; the whole temple, both the
holy of holies and the holy place, and the court of the priests; so that
it was visible to all, and was a token of the divine presence of God, of
his taking possession of his house, and of his taking up his residence
in it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 8:11</span></span>

So that the priests could not stand to minister, because of the
cloud,.... Either through the darkness it first caused, or through the
light that broke out of it, which was dazzling to them, or through the
terror it struck their minds with; they could neither minister in the
holy place, by offering incense there; and as for the most holy place,
none but the high priest could minister there, and that on one day only;
nor in the court of the priests, at the altar of burnt offerings:

for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord; a bright and
glorious stream came forth from the cloud, and spread itself all over
the house, and then took up its abode in the most holy place as in the
tabernacle, [Exo 40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 8:12</span></span>

And then spake Solomon,.... Perceiving by this symbol that the Lord was
come into his house, to take up his dwelling in it, and seeing the
priests and people in consternation at it, spake the following words to
their comfort:

the Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness; and now was
fulfilling his promise, and therefore to be considered not as a token of
his displeasure, but of his gracious presence; this was done for the
greater awe of the divine Majesty, and to denote the darkness of the
former dispensation; reference may be had to [Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md) or rather this was now said by
the Lord, that is, it appeared to be his resolution and determination to
dwell in this manner; the Targum is,

"the Lord is pleased to cause his Shechinah or divine Majesty to dwell
in Jerusalem,''

in the temple there. This was imitated by the Heathens; hence the
Lacedemonians had a temple dedicated to Jupiter Scotitas, or the dark,
as Pausanias (u) relates; and the Indian Pagans to this day affect
darkness in their temples, and are very careful that no light enter into
them but by the door, which is commonly strait and low, and by little
crevices in the windows (w).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 8:13</span></span>

I have surely built thee an house to dwell in,.... Turning himself from
the priests and people, he quieted with a few words, he addressed the
Lord; having built an house for him, for his worship and glory, with
this view, that he might dwell in it, he was now, by the above token,
fully assured it would be an habitation for him:

a settled place for thee to abide in for ever; which is observed in
distinction from the tabernacle of Moses, which was often removed from
place to place, otherwise this did not continue for ever; though Solomon
might hope it would, at least unto the times of the Messiah; and indeed
such a building on this spot, for such use, did continue so long,
excepting the interval of the seventy years' captivity in Babylon.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 8:14</span></span>

And the king turned his face about,.... He was before the altar, [Kg1
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022.md), with his face to that first, and
looking towards the holy and the most holy place, filled with the cloud
and glory; and now he turned himself and stood with the altar behind
him, and looking to the court of the people:

and blessed all the congregation of Israel; either blessed the Lord
before them, or prayed for blessings for them, or congratulated them
upon the Lord's taking up his residence in the temple, which was so
great an honour and favour to them:

and all the congregation of Israel stood: ready to receive the king's
blessing, and in honour of him, and reverence to the divine Being. The
Jews say, none might sit in the court but the kings of the house of
David.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 8:15</span></span>

And he said, blessed be the Lord God of Israel,.... All praise and
glory, honour and blessing, be ascribed to the Lord; who had afresh
shown himself to be Israel's covenant God, by taking up his residence
among them in the temple he had filled with his glory:

which spake with his mouth to David my father, and hath with his hand
fulfilled it; who graciously promised him he should have a son that
should build an house for him, and which he had by his power and
providence faithfully performed; or rather which spake concerning David,
so Noldius (x); for God did not speak with his mouth to David, but to
Nathan, of him: saying; as follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 8:16</span></span>

Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt,....
Which was now about four hundred and eighty eight years ago; see [Kg1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md).

I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that
my name might be therein; he had chosen one in his mind from all
eternity; but he had not made known this choice, nor the place he had
chosen; he gave hints by Moses, that there was a place which he should
choose, or declare he had chosen to put his name in, but did not express
it, [Deu 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md) but now it was a clear
case that he had chosen Jerusalem, and that was the city he always had
in view, see [Ch2 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#006.md),

but I chose David to be over my people Israel; to be their king, and to
him he gave the first hint of the place where the temple was to be
built, [Ch1 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001.md), and he chose no man,
and his family with him, before him, to rule over Israel, and be
concerned in such a work, see [Ch2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#005.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 8:17</span></span>

And it was in the heart of David my father,.... His mind was disposed to
it, his heart was set upon it, he had taken up a resolution:

to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel; for his
worship and service, for his honour and glory, [Sa2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#003.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 8:18</span></span>

And the Lord said unto David my father,.... By Nathan the prophet:

whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst
well that it was in thine heart; his design was good, and so far it was
acceptable to the Lord, that he thought of such a thing, though it was
not his pleasure that should do it, as follows.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 8:19</span></span>

Nevertheless, thou shall not build the house,.... Which is implied in
the question in [Sa2 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#005.md).

but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the
house unto my name; which is expressed in [Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 8:20</span></span>

And the Lord hath performed his word that he spake,.... To David,
concerning his son's building the temple:

and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne
of Israel, as the Lord promised; succeeded him in the kingdom:

and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel; the
temple he had now finished; and thus the promise to David was punctually
fulfilled, that he should have a son that should succeed him in the
throne, and build the house of the Lord.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 8:21</span></span>

And I have set there a place for the ark,.... The most holy place:

wherein is the covenant of the Lord; the two tables of stone, on which
were the covenant of the Lord, as the Targum:

which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of
Egypt; as in [Kg1 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 8:22</span></span>

And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord,.... The altar of the
burnt offering in the court of the priests, where he prayed the
following prayer; and which altar was typical of Christ, who is always
to be in sight in prayer, and through whom all sacrifices of prayer and
praise become acceptable to God. In [Ch2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013.md) he is said to stand upon a
scaffold of brass, five cubits long, five broad, and three high, which
stood in the midst of the court; it was a sort of a pulpit, round, as a
laver, for which the word is sometimes used, and on which he kneeled:

in the presence of all the congregation of Israel; who stood in the
great court before him, called the court of Israel:

and spread forth his hands toward heaven; and hence it appears, that
though Solomon stood before the altar, he did not lay hold on it with
his hands, as the Heathens did when they prayed; for they say (y), that
prayer alone does not appease the Deity, unless he that prays also lays
hold on the altar with his hands; hence altars, at first, as we are told
(z), were called "ansae"; and lifting up or spreading the hands towards
heaven was a proper gesture with the Greeks and Romans (a).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 8:23</span></span>

And he said, Lord God of Israel,.... Their covenant God and Father,
whereby he was distinguished from all the gods of the Gentiles:

there is no god like thee; in heaven above or on earth beneath; none
among the angels in heaven, nor among kings and civil magistrates on
earth, who both are sometimes called "Elohim" gods; but only in a
figurative sense, and not to be compared with the one only true God, for
the perfection of his nature, or the works of his hands:

who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee
with all their heart; performs his promises, by which he both declares
his mercy or goodness and his faithfulness to such who walk before him,
in his ways, and according to his word, in the sincerity and uprightness
of their hearts.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 8:24</span></span>

Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst
him..... Concerning a son, his successor, and the builder of the temple:

thou, spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine
hand, as it is this day; the temple being now finished by him, see [Kg1
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#015.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 8:25</span></span>

Therefore now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father
that thou promisedst him,.... That as he had fulfilled one part of his
promise respecting himself, his immediate successor, so that he would
fulfil the other respecting his more remote offspring:

saying, there shall not fail thee a man in my sight, to sit on the
throne of Israel; one of David's posterity to inherit his throne and
kingdom, but with this proviso:

so that thy children takes heed to their way; in what way they walk, and
how they walk in it:

that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me; meaning as David
walked, see [Psa 132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 8:26</span></span>

And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,....
Truly made good, and punctually performed:

which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father; the same request in
other words, repeated to show his ardent and vehement desire to have it

But will God indeed dwell on the earth?.... Is it true? Can any credit
be given to it? Who could ever have thought it, that so great and
glorious a Being, who inhabits eternity, dwells in the highest heavens,
should ever condescend to dwell on earth? Such was the amazing
condescension of Christ, the Son of God, to tabernacle in human nature
with men on earth, to which Solomon perhaps might have respect; his
temple being the figure of his body, in which the Godhead dwells, [Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md).

behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee; not,
only the visible heavens, but the third heaven, where the throne of God
is, and is the habitation of angels and saints; though there God makes
the most glorious displays of himself yet he is so immense and infinite,
that he is not to be comprehended and circumscribed in any place
whatever:

how much less this house that I have builded? Though temples built for
idols contain them, and are large enough, yet Solomon had no notion,
when he built his temple, though it was for the name of God, that he was
restrained to it, but dwelt everywhere, filling heaven and earth with
his presence.

Yet have thou respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to his
supplication, O Lord my God,.... Meaning himself, who, though a king
acknowledged himself, and esteemed it an honour to be the servant of the
Lord, and who was also an humble suppliant of his, and desired his
prayers and supplications might be attended to:

to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth
before thee this day; the particulars of which follow.

That thine eyes may be open towards this house night and day,.... That
is, to the people that pray in it, as they are to his righteous ones,
[Psa 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#014.md) even towards the place of
which thou hast my name shall be there; there should be some displays of
his presence, power, and providence, of goodness, grace, and mercy:

that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make
towards this place; not only to what he should make in it, but to what
he should make in his own house, with his face directed towards this, as
would be, and was the practice of good people in later times, yea, even
when the temple lay in ruins; see [Dan
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010.md) figuring the respect gracious
souls have to Christ by faith in their prayers, in whom the Godhead
dwells bodily, see [Jon 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#004.md) and it is
observable, according to a Jewish canon (b), one at a distance, in
another land, was not only to turn his face to the land of Israel, but
direct his heart to Jerusalem, and the temple, and the holy of holies;
and if in the land, to Jerusalem, &c. and if in Jerusalem, not only to
the temple, and holy of holies, but if behind the mercy seat, he was to
turn his face to it; which was a symbol of Christ, the propitiatory and
throne of grace, to be looked unto by faith, [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md).

And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people
Israel, when they shall pray towards this place,.... Not only he desires
his prayers might be heard, but those of the people of Israel, then, and
at all times in succeeding ages, whenever they should look towards the
temple, and to him that was typified by it; to whose blood,
righteousness, sacrifice and mediation, the acceptance of prayers with
God is to be ascribed:

and hear thou in heaven thy dwellingplace; for though he condescended to
take up his residence in the temple, yet his more proper and more
glorious dwelling was in heaven, and from whence, notwithstanding the
distance of it, he could hear the prayers of his people, and does:

and when thou hearest, forgive; manifest and apply pardoning grace and
mercy on account of sins confessed, and repented of; or remove
calamities and distresses on account of sin, which sometimes is meant,
and frequently in this prayer, by the forgiveness of sin.

If any man trespass against his neighbour,.... By being unfaithful in a
trust committed to him, or the like:

and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear; he denying that ever
anything was committed to his trust, and there being no witnesses of it,
the judge obliges him to take an oath he never had any:

and the oath come before thine altar in this house; where it was taken,
as in the presence of God, and as appealing to him: hence in corrupt
times they came to swear by the altar, [Mat
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#020.md) and so the Heathens used to take
their oaths in the temples of their gods, and at their altars, as the
instances of Callicrates (c) and Hannibal (d) show, and others Grotius
refers to; yea, they also laid hold on the altar, at least touched it
when they swore (e) to give the greater sanction to the oath.

to have justice done him:

affirming, the other denying

condemning the wicked, by bringing his way upon his head: inflicting
upon him the punishment imprecated by him in his oath:

When thy people Israel shall be smitten down before the enemy,....
Beaten and routed, many slain, and others carried captive; which had
been their case, and might be again, and was, though now a time of
peace:

because they have sinned against thee; which always was the reason of
their being given up into the hands of their enemies:

and shall turn again to thee; to thy worship, as the Targum, having
fallen into idolatry, which was generally the case when they fell before
their enemies:

and confess thy name; own him to be the true God, acknowledge his
justice in their punishment, confess their sin, repent of it, and give
him glory:

and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house; not the
captives, unless it should be rendered, as it may, "toward this house"
(f); but those that escaped, or their brethren that went not out to
battle, who should pray for them here.

When heaven is shut up,.... As it may be said to be when the air is
quite serene, and not a cloud in it:

and there is no rain; in its season, neither the former nor the latter,
as it was in the times of Elijah:

because they have sinned against thee; want of rain was threatened in
case of sin, and was always the effect of it, [Lev
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md),

if they pray towards this place; in any part of the country where they
were; for it sometimes rained on one city, and not on another, [Amo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007.md).

and confess thy name; own his power and his providence, and the justness
of his dealings with them:

and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them; their affliction
being made useful, to bring them to a sense of their sin, and to
repentance for it, and reformation from it; or, "when thou hearest" or
"answerest them" (g); so the Targum, receives their prayer; thus the
goodness of God leads to repentance.

Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of
thy people Israel,.... By removing the judgment of drought upon them:

that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk; the way of
worship and duty prescribed by the Lord which was good in itself, and
good for them, good things being enjoyed by them that walk therein; and
this the Lord sometimes teaches by afflictions, as well as by his word;
but whenever he does it, it is by his Spirit, and then afflictions are
blessings, [Psa 104:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#019.md) where the same
phrase is differently rendered:

Through want of rain, or any other cause, as there had been a three
years' famine in the time of David, and it is supposed it might be
again, though Canaan was a land flowing with milk and honey:

if there be pestilence; as there had been, for David's numbering the
people:

blasting; or blights, occasioned by the east wind:

mildew; a kind of clammy dew, which falling on plants, corn, &c.
corrupts and destroys them, see [Amo

locust, or

if there be caterpillar; creatures very pernicious to the fruits of the
earth, and cause a scarcity of them, see [Joe

What prayer and supplication soever,.... On account of any of the above
things, or any other:

be made by any man, or by all the people Israel; by a private man, for
such an one might go to the temple and pray by himself; see [Luk
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#010.md) or by the public congregation:

which shall know every man the plague of his own heart; be sensible of
his sin as the cause of his distress, and own it, though ever so
privately committed, which none knows but God and his own heart; and
which may be only an heart sin, not actually committed; as all sin is
originally in the heart, and springs from it, that is the source of all
wickedness; it may respect the corruption of nature, indwelling sin,
which truly deserves this name, and which every good man is led to
observe, confess, and bewail, [Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md). In [Ch2

shall know his own sore and his own grief; what particularly affects
him, and gives him pain and sorrow, as every man best knows his own
affliction and trouble, and so can best represent his own case to the
Lord:

and spread forth his hands towards this house; pray with his face
towards it, and his hands spread out, a prayer gesture, and what was now
used by Solomon, [Kg1 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022.md).

Then hear thou in heaven thy dwellingplace,.... Which was more properly
so than this Solomon had built, and the Lord had taken possession of:

and forgive; remove the calamity and distress, be it what it may:

and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou
knowest: that his prayer is cordial and sincere, his confession and
repentance genuine, and that he is truly sensible of his sin, and sorry
for it, and is pure in his intentions and resolutions, through divine
grace, to depart from it for the future:

(for thou, even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of
men;) he knows all men, the hearts of them all, what is in them, what
comes out of them, and is according to them; omniscience belongs only to

and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; which
were consistent with the will of God and his glory, and for the good of
the stranger; this is more absolutely and unconditionally expressed than
the requests for the Israelites; it is not desired that he would do by
them according to their ways, and if they turned from their sins, or
knew the plague of their hearts; the reason of which is supposed to be,
because the Israelites knew the will of God, when the strangers did not;
and therefore it is desired that, notwithstanding their ignorance, and
their non-compliance with the divine will, through that, they might be
heard and answered:

that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy
people Israel; might know him to be a God, hearing and answering prayer,
forgiving sin, and bestowing favours, which might lead them to fear him
and his goodness, as Israel did:

and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called
by thy name; that he dwelt in it, granted his presence, heard and
received the supplications of men, answered their requests, and accepted
of their sacrifices here. Solomon seems to have had knowledge of the
calling of the Gentiles, and to desire it.

counsel of God, or having a direction and commission from him by a
prophet, or some other way, to engage in war with the enemy:

and shall pray unto the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen, and
toward the house I have built for thy name: for, notwithstanding the
justness of their cause, and having a warrant from God to go to war, yet
they were to pray to him for success when at a distance, even in a
foreign land, and about to engage the enemy; and this they were to do,
turning their faces towards the city of Jerusalem, and the temple there;
declaring thereby that their dependence was upon the Lord that dwelt
there, and their expectation of victory was only from him.

nature, the treachery of the heart, and the temptations of Satan, of
which Solomon had early notice, and was afterwards still more confirmed
in the truth of, [Ecc 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md).

and thou be angry with them; for their sins, and resent their conduct:

so as to deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive
unto the land of the enemy, far or near; as into Assyria or Babylon,
whither they were carried.

that carried them captives; though and while they are in such a state:

saying, we have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed
wickedness; which phrases include all their sins, with all the

arguments taken from what the people of Israel were to the Lord, and he

them, succeed and prosper them, so Solomon desires he might be with
them: nothing is more desirable than the presence of God; Solomon could
not have prayed for a greater blessing for himself and his people; the
Targum is,

"let the Word of the Lord our God be for our help, as he was for the
help of our fathers:''

let him not leave us, nor forsake us: this was no doubt a prayer of
faith, founded upon a divine promise, [Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:58](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">kg1 8:58</span></span>

That he may incline our hearts unto him,.... By his Spirit, to love,
fear, and serve him; to attend to his worship, word, and ordinances:

to walk in all his ways; he has prescribed and directed to:

and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which
he commanded our fathers; all his laws, moral, ceremonial, and judicial.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:59](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">kg1 8:59</span></span>

And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the
Lord,.... At this time:

be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night; be continually remembered
and regarded by him, that so gracious answers might always be returned
to those who supplicated in this place:

that he maintain the cause of his servant; of himself and his successors
in the throne, that they may continue to possess it in peace, to the
glory of God, and the good of the people:

and the cause of his people Israel at all times: that their rights and
privileges might be continued, and they supported in them; and both his
cause and theirs be regarded:

as the matter shall require; as they should stand in need of assistance,
direction, and protection.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:60](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">kg1 8:60</span></span>

That all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God,.... By
chastising the people of Israel when they sinned; by bearing and
answering their prayers when they prayed unto him; by forgiving their
sins, and delivering them out of their troubles; by maintaining their
cause, and protecting them in the enjoyment of their blessings: and that
there is "none else"; no God besides him; all being else fictitious
deities, or nominal ones; he only is the one living and true God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">kg1 8:61</span></span>

Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord your God,.... Sincere
in their love to him, united in their worship of him, and constant in
their obedience to him:

to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day:
as they did that day, neither king nor people having as yet fallen into
idolatry, but showing by their then present appearance a zeal for God,
his house, and worship.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:62](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">kg1 8:62</span></span>

And the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the Lord.
For burnt offerings, which having been laid upon the altar, as soon as
the king had done praying to God, and blessing the people, and exhorting
them, fire came down from heaven, and consumed them; which showed the
Lord's acceptance of the sacrifices, and was another confirmation,
besides the cloud, of the Lord's well pleasedness with the temple, and
of his taking possession of it to reside in it; upon which the people
bowed and worshipped, and praised the Lord for his goodness and mercy,
[Ch2 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">kg1 8:63</span></span>

And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered
unto the Lord,.... Part of which belonged to the offerer, and with those
Solomon feasted the people all the days of the feast of the dedication,
if not of tabernacles also; for the number was exceeding large, as
follows:

22,000 oxen, and 120,000 sheep; which, as suggested, might be the number
for all the fourteen days; nor need it seem incredible, since, as
Josephus (b) says, at a passover celebrated in the times of Cestius the
Roman governor, at the evening of the passover, in two hours time
256,500 lambs were slain; however, this was a very munificent sacrifice
of Solomon's, in which he greatly exceeded the Heathens, whose highest
number of sacrifices were hecatombs, or by hundreds, but his by
thousands:

so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the
Lord; devoted it to divine and religious worship by these sacrifices:
hence in imitation of this sprung the dedication of temples with the
Heathens; the first of which among the Romans was that in the capitol at
Rome (c) by Romulus; the rites and ceremonies used therein by them may
be read in Cicero, Livy, Tacitus, and others (d).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">kg1 8:64</span></span>

The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before
the house of the Lord,.... The court of the priests that was before the
holy place, adjoining to it, in which was the altar of burnt offering;
this, or, however, the middle part of it, he sanctified for present use,
to offer sacrifices on, for a reason hereafter given:

for there he offered burnt offerings and meat offerings, and the fat of
the peace offerings; which was the reason why the middle of the great
court was for this time set apart for this service.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">kg1 8:65</span></span>

And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him,....
Partaking of the parts of the peace offerings which belonged to him, and
were offered by way of thanksgiving on the occasion, together with
whatsoever he might as a liberal prince provide for this entertainment:

for it was for a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto
the river of Egypt; consisting of a number of people, gathered together
from Hamath, which was on the northern border of the land of Israel, to
the river of Egypt; either the Nile, or Rhinoculura, a branch of it,
which lay on the southern border of the land: and this was kept

before the Lord; as in his presence, with thankfulness to him, and with
a view to his glory:

seven days and seven days, even fourteen days; seven days for the
dedication of the house, and seven days for the feast of tabernacles, as
the Targum; which agrees with [Ch2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#009.md), the feast of dedication was
first, and began perhaps on the seventh day of the month, as the feast
of tabernacles did on the fifteenth: within this time, namely, on the
tenth, was a fast day, the day of atonement; which was either observed
between the two feasts, or was omitted, which is not likely; or they did
not eat and drink until the evening of that day. The Septuagint version,
according to the Vatican copy, reads "seven days" only once; see [Ch2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">kg1 8:66</span></span>

On the eighth day he sent the people away,.... That is, of the feast of
tabernacles, the eighth from the first of that, which was a solemn day,
and fell on the twenty second of the month; at the close of which the
dismission was made, or they had leave to go, but they did not until the
twenty third, according to [Ch2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010.md).

and they blessed the king; returned him thanks for his care, and charge,
and pains, in building the temple; for prayers for them, and the feast
he had now made, and wished all health and happiness to him:

and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart; or to their cities,
as the Targum, to their several habitations; being greatly delighted
with what they had seen and heard, and partook of especially:

for all the goodness the Lord had done for David his servant, and for
Israel his people; in [Ch2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010.md), it is
added, "unto Solomon"; for David, in giving him such a son and
successor, who according to promise had built the house of the Lord; and
for Solomon, in raising him up to such dignity, and enabling him to
build such a temple for the worship of God and his glory; and for the
people of Israel, in giving them such a king to rule over them, under
whom they enjoyed so much peace and prosperity, and the full and free
exercise of the true religion, with such accommodations, and in such a
splendid manner as now.
