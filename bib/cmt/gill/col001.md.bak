### [Colossians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO COLOSSIANS 1

This chapter contains the inscription of the epistle; the apostle's
usual salutation; his thanksgiving to God on behalf of the Colossians
for grace received; his prayers, that more might be given them; an
enumeration of various blessings of grace, which require thankfulness,
in which the glories and excellencies of Christ are particularly set
forth: and it is concluded with an exhortation to a steadfast adherence
to the Gospel, taken from the nature, excellency, and usefulness of the
ministry of it. The inscription, and the salutation, are in [Col
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md), and are the same with those in
the epistle to the Ephesians, only Timothy is joined with the apostle
here, and the Colossians have the additional character of brethren given
them. The thanksgiving is in [Col 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003.md),
the object of it is God, the Father of Christ; the time when made, when
in prayer to him; its subject matter, the faith and love of the saints;
to which is added, their happiness secured for them in heaven, their
hope was conversant with: and whereas the Gospel was the means by which
they came to the hearing and knowledge of it, this is commended from the
subject of it, the doctrine of truth; from the spread of it in the
world; and from its efficacy in bringing forth fruit in all, to whom it
came in power, and that with constancy, [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md), and also from the testimony of
Epaphras, a faithful minister of Christ, and theirs, who was dear to the
apostle, and of whom he had the above account of them, [Col
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007.md). And then follow his prayers for
them, that they might have an increase of spiritual knowledge, and that
they might put in practice what they knew; and for that purpose he
entreats they might be blessed with strength, patience, and
longsuffering, [Col 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md). And in order
to excite thankfulness in himself and them, he takes notice of various
blessings of grace; of the Father's grace in giving a meetness for
eternal glory and happiness, by delivering from the power of darkness,
and translating into the kingdom of his Son, [Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md), and of the Son's grace in
obtaining redemption by his blood, and procuring the remission of sins,
[Col 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#014.md), which leads the apostle to
enlarge upon the excellencies of the author of these blessings, in his
divine person, as the image of God, and the first cause of all created
beings, [Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), which he proves by
an enumeration of them, as created by him, and for his sake, by his
pre-existence to them, and their dependence on him, [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md), and in his office capacity, as
Mediator, being the head of the church, the governor of it, and the
first that rose from the dead; by all which it appears that he has, and
ought to have the pre-eminence, [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md). And this is still more manifest
from his having all fulness dwelling in him, to supply his body the
church, of which he is the head, [Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md), and from the reconciliation of
all the members of it to God by him, [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md), which blessing of grace is
amplified partly by the subjects of it, who are described by their
former state and condition, aliens and enemies, and by their present
one, reconciled by the death of Christ in his fleshly body; and partly
by the end of it, the presentation of them holy, blameless, and
irreprovable in the sight of God, [Col
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021.md). Wherefore it is a duty incumbent
on such to abide by the Gospel of Christ, which brings the good tidings
of peace and reconciliation, and is the means of faith and hope; and the
rather, since they had heard it themselves, and others also, even every
creature under heaven; and the apostle was a minister of it, [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md), and on his ministration of it he
enlarges, by observing his sufferings for the church on account of the
Gospel, which he endured with pleasure; and therefore they should, by
his example, be encouraged to continue in it, [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md). Moreover, he argues the same
from his commission of God to preach it for their sakes, [Col
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025.md), and from the nature and subject
matter of it, being a hidden mystery, and containing riches and glory in
it; yea, Christ himself, the foundation of hope of eternal glory, [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md), and from the end of preaching
it, which was to present every man perfect in Christ; which end the
apostle laboured and strove to obtain through the power and energy of
divine grace, which wrought in him, and with him, [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028.md).

[Colossians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 1:1</span></span>

Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,.... The apostle puts his name to this
epistle, by which he was known in the Gentile world, as he usually does
in all his epistles; and styles himself "an apostle", as he was, having
seen Christ in person, and received his commission, doctrine, and
qualifications immediately from him, with a power of doing miracles to
confirm the truth of his mission. This he chose to make mention of,
partly because the false teachers everywhere insinuated that he was not
an apostle; and partly to give the greater sanction and authority, and
command the greater regard and credit to what he should say; as well as
to excuse his freedom in writing to them whom he had never seen, since
he was an apostle of the Gentiles, and so to them; see [Rom
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013.md); he calls himself an apostle "of
Jesus Christ"; not of men, he was not sent out by men, but by Christ,
who appeared to him, made him a minister of his, gave him his Gospel by
revelation, abundantly qualified him for the work, sent him forth unto
the Gentiles, in whose name he went as an ambassador and messenger of
his, and whom he preached, and by whom he was greatly succeeded, to the
conversion of many souls, who were seals of his apostleship in every
place, [Co1 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002.md), into which office he
came

by the will of God; not by the will of men, for he derived no authority
and power, nor received any doctrine from men; nor by his own will, of
his own head, by any usurpation of his; he did not take this office upon
him of himself, but was invested with it, according to the secret will
and purpose of God, from everlasting, who had ordained and appointed him
to this service, and according to his will of command made known to him
in time, when he told him what he should do, and openly separated, and
sent him forth to do the work he had called him to; and which arose not
from any merits or worthiness of the apostle, but from the sovereign
good will and pleasure, free grace and favour, of God, to which the
apostle continually ascribes it in all his epistles:

and Timotheus our brother; who joined with the apostle in this epistle,
and whom he calls a "brother"; partly because of the Christian relation
he stood in to him, and them, they being all brethren, children of the
same Father, partakers of the same grace of regeneration, belonging to
the same family, and so should own and love one another as brethren; and
partly and chiefly because of his being a brother, companion, fellow
soldier, and a fellow labourer in the Gospel. He mentions him, either
because he was known unto them, or that he might be so; and to show the
agreement there was between them in the doctrine of Christ, which might
have the greater weight with them to abide in it.

[Colossians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 1:2</span></span>

To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ,.... This is the
inscription of the epistle, in which the persons wrote unto are
described as "saints", or holy men; not by birth, for all are unholy and
unclean by nature; nor by baptism, for that neither takes away sin, nor
gives grace; nor merely externally, by an outward reformation; but by
separation, being by an act of eternal election set apart for God, for
holiness, and happiness; and by imputation, Christ being made
sanctification to them; and by the sanctifying grace of the Spirit of
God in regeneration, being called with an holy calling, and having
principles of grace and holiness wrought in them, and they formed as new
men in righteousness and true holiness: and as "brethren"; being born of
God, having him for their Father, and being of his household, and a part
of the family in heaven and earth named of Christ, and heirs together of
the grace of life, and of the heavenly glory: and as "faithful" ones;
true and sincere believers in Christ, constant and persevering in the
faith of him; faithful to the Gospel, and their profession of it, and to
Christ, whose name they bore, and to one another, to whom they stood in
the relation of brethren: and all this "in Christ"; and by, and through
him; they were saints in him; they were chosen in him, and sanctified in
him their head, and received all their holiness from him; they were
brethren in him the firstborn of them; his God being their God, and his
Father their Father; and had their faith and faithfulness from him, as
well as it was exercised towards, and on him: and they are further
described by the place of their abode,

which are at Colosse: a city of Phrygia:

grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
Christ. This is the salutation, and which stands in this form in most of
Paul's epistles; See Gill on [Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md).
The Syriac version puts "peace" before "grace", and leaves out the last
clause, "and the Lord Jesus Christ"; as does also the Ethiopic version.

[Colossians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 1:3</span></span>

We give thanks to God,.... Meaning himself and Timothy. This is the
beginning of the epistle, which is introduced with a thanksgiving to
God; to whom praise and thankfulness are always due as a Creator and
preserver, as the author of all good things, as the Father of mercies,
temporal and spiritual, and as the covenant God and Father of his people
through Christ: wherefore it follows,

and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; the sense of which either is,
that God the Father, who is the object of praise and thanksgiving, is
both the God of Christ, and the Father of Christ, the God of Christ, as
Christ is man, and the Father of Christ, as Christ is God; or the latter
is exegetical of the former, and may be rendered thus, "God, even the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ": and very properly are thanks given to
him under this character, because it is as he is the Father of Christ
that he blesses his people with all spiritual blessings; and because he
is their God, as well as his God; and their Father, as well as his
Father, though in a different sense, his by nature, theirs by adoption.
Moreover, as all their blessings come from God, as the Father of Christ,
and through Christ, and for his sake, so it is very proper that thanks
should be returned unto him under that character; and through Christ, by
whom alone such sacrifices of praise are acceptable to God: it is added,

praying always for you; which, as it is expressive of the constant
discharge of the duty of prayer, and the continual remembrance of these
saints in it, and shows the affection the apostle had for them; so it
points out the time when, and the way and manner in which Paul and
Timothy gave thanks to God on account of them; it was when they were at
the throne of grace, and in their frequent prayers to God; thankfulness
for mercies received, both by ourselves and others, being a branch of
the duty of prayer.

[Colossians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 1:4</span></span>

Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,.... This expresses the
matter of their thankfulness, or what it was they gave thanks to God
for, their faith in Christ; by which is not only meant their hearty
assent to the whole doctrine of faith, concerning the person, offices,
and grace of Christ, their soundness and steadfastness in it, and their
sincere and constant profession of it; but the grace of faith in them,
the operation of the Spirit of God in their souls, which had not Moses,
nor any mere man, but Christ for its object; by which they looked unto
him as a Saviour, went unto him as such, ventured on him, committed
themselves unto him, leaned and relied upon him; that grace which comes
from him, has him for its author and finisher, and returns unto him, and
lives on him. This Paul and Timothy had heard of by their minister
Epaphras; and it shows that they made no secret of it, did not keep it
to themselves, but declared, confessed, and published it to others, as
is the duty of all believers to do; and thanks being given for it to
God, makes it a clear point that it was not of themselves, but was the
gift of God, otherwise there would have been no need of thankfulness for
it; as also, that it is a very eminent grace, and of great use and
service to such who are possessed of it,

And of love which ye have to all the saints; this is another thing for
which thanks are given to God. The object of this grace are "saints";
all men indeed are to be loved, and even our very enemies; and good is
to be done to all, but especially to holy and good men, to the household
of faith; and these are "all" to be loved and respected; nor is any
respect or difference of persons to be made on account of country, or
natural relation, as Jews or Gentiles, or of outward state and
condition, as rich or poor, bond or free, or of greater or lesser gifts
and grace, weak or strong believers, or of different sentiments in the
lesser matters of religion. It denotes both the grace of love itself,
which is a fruit of the Spirit implanted in regeneration, and is an
evidence of the new birth, and always is where true faith in Christ is,
for faith works by it; and also the effects of it, which lies not in
bare words, in expressions of spiritual affection and friendship, but in
deeds, by serving one another in love, by relieving in necessity,
sympathizing in distress, praying with and for one another, and the
like; all which these saints were famous for.

[Colossians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 1:5</span></span>

For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven,.... These words may be
considered either in connection with the foregoing, and express the
reason or motive which encouraged these saints to believe in Christ, and
to go on believing in him, and hold fast the profession of their faith
in him, and to love the saints, and show it upon all occasions, and in
every case; because of the rich treasure of glory and happiness in
reserve for them in heaven, which they were hoping and waiting for; this
encouraged their faith in Christ, and enlarged their love and
beneficence to the saints: or else with the thanksgiving of the apostle,
and so contains fresh matter of it, that as thanks were given for faith
and love, so for "hope"; by which is meant, not the grace of hope, for
that is not in heaven, though it enters within the vail, and is
conversant with heavenly things, but is in the heart; and though it
supposes it, and which these persons had; they were not without it; they
had a good hope through grace of eternal glory, for faith, hope, and
love, always go together: nor Christ the foundation of hope; there are
many things in him, which are a ground of hope of happiness, as his
sufferings, and death, and redemption thereby; his resurrection from the
dead, his intercessions and preparations; the promise of life in him,
and the thing itself being in his gift; his righteousness and grace,
which, give a title to it, and meetness for it; and he is also in
heaven, but then he cannot be said to be laid up there: but the thing
hoped for, everlasting happiness, is intended; see [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md) [Gal
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005.md); which is so called, because it is
the object of hope; is not yet possessed; is future; is not seen; is
difficult, and yet possible to be enjoyed: this is said to be "laid up";
which denotes the preciousness and valuableness of it, it is a treasure,
an inheritance, a kingdom, and riches of glory; and the secrecy and
hiddenness of it, it consists of things invisible to the bodily eye, and
which are out of the reach of carnal sense and reason, of which faith
only has some small glimpse; and also the safety of it, it is hid in
Christ, it is reserved "in heaven", and cannot be come at, and spoiled
by men or devils; and likewise the free grace and goodness of God in
laying up and providing things of such a nature for his children and
friends: the place where it is, in heaven, where moth and rust corrupt
not, and thieves cannot break through and steal; and so is safe, and
must be of an heavenly nature, as it is for heavenly persons: "for you";
the saints and faithful brethren in Christ, for those who were chosen in
Christ, for whom it was prepared from the foundation of the world; for
this is not laid up for any, for everyone, but for the chosen of God,
and precious; whom God has distinguished by his grace, Christ has
redeemed by his blood, and the Spirit regenerates and sanctifies, and
who have faith, hope, and love, given unto them; and this was not only
laid up for them, but they knew of it, they were made acquainted with
it:

whereof ye heard before; before the writing of this epistle, under the
ministry of their faithful teacher Epaphras:

in the word of the truth of the Gospel; or in the true word of the
Gospel; which comes from the God of truth, is indited by the Spirit of
truth, is concerning Christ the truth, and which contains nothing but
truth, and lies in the Scriptures of truth: or "in the word of truth",
even the Gospel; which explains what word of truth is meant. The law is
the word of truth; and many of the words of men, of the philosophers,
were words of truth; but it was not in either of them they had heard of
eternal life laid up in heaven; of which there were hopes to be
entertained by sinful creatures, enjoying it through Christ: this is
what only the Gospel brings an account of; life and immortality are only
brought to light by the Gospel; which not only speaks of it, but lays
that before men, which give them ground and encouragement to hope for
it.

[Colossians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 1:6</span></span>

Which is come unto you,.... That is, the Gospel, which came to them from
God, from heaven, from Christ, out of Jerusalem, from whence the word of
the Lord was to come, by the ministers of the Gospel, who being sent,
came to Colosse, and there preached it; and so the Syriac version
renders the words , "which is preached unto you". And a wonderful
instance of the free grace of God this was; they did not seek, inquire
for, and go after the Gospel, but it came to them; and so Christ was
found of them by it, who sought him not, and made manifest in his
person, grace, and righteousness to them that asked not after him: for
this Gospel came not to them in, word only, but with the power of the
Holy Spirit: it was come, , "into you", as the phrase may be rendered,
into their very hearts, and wrought effectually there, enlightening,
convincing, comforting, and instructing them; where it had a place, and
remained; for the words may be read, as they are by the Arabic version,
"which is present with you". The Gospel is always in one place or
another, and will be to the end of the world; but it is not always in
the same place; but as yet it was not removed from Colosse; it was still
with them in the external ministry of it, and it remained in their
hearts in the powerful and comfortable experience of it:

as it is in all the world; as it was come into, and preached to all the
world, and was made useful, and continued in all the world at that time.
Christ gave his disciples a commission to go into all the world, and
preach the Gospel to every creature; it was no more to be restrained to
a particular nation, but was made general and common to all the nations
of the world, and accordingly they preached it to all; and by this time
had delivered the joyful message to the greater part of the world, which
is sometimes meant by all the world, and the whole world; or it had been
now preached in all the known and habitable parts of the world by one
apostle and another, some being sent into one part, and some into
another; so that the grace of God appeared to all men, and the doctrine
of it had been preached to every creature under the heaven, according to
Christ's commission; the Gospel of the kingdom was to be preached in all
the world, for a witness to all nations, before the end of the Jewish
state came, or before the destruction of Jerusalem, which was not many
years after the writing of this epistle. Now this shows, that it was the
same Gospel which had been preached at Colosse by their faithful
minister there, as had been preached in other areas, and in all parts of
the world by the apostles; which is said in the commendation of the
Gospel, it being one, uniform, consistent, and all of a piece in every
place, and as preached by every faithful minister, and might serve
greatly to confirm the Colossians in their faith of it:

and bringeth forth fruit: by which is meant, either the conversion of
sinners, the fruit of the Gospel ministry, when attended with a divine
blessing and power; or the graces of the Spirit, as faith, hope, love,
repentance, humility, self-denial, &c. with all the effects thereof, in
new obedience, and a godly conversation, which come from Christ, the
green fir tree, and are produced by the Spirit, through the preaching of
the Gospel. The Vulgate Latin adds, "and increaseth"; the Syriac version
has the same; and it is so read in some Greek copies, as in the
Alexandrian copy, two of Stephens's, and in the Complutensian edition;
and may intend the spread of the Gospel among others, besides those who
first received it, and the growing fruitfulness of the professors of it
under its influence:

as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it; as soon as ever it
came among them they hearkened to it, they were inclined to hear it
externally, and a divine power going along with it, giving them hearing
ears, and understanding hearts, they heard it, so as to know it, love
it, and believe it; and from that time it brought forth fruit, and
increased in them, and they continued in the faith and profession of it;
so that as the Gospel is commended both from the large spread and
efficacy of it, as well as its uniformity in every place, these
Colossians also are commended for their hearing of it, both externally
and internally, and for their perseverance in it: and which is further
illustrated in the following clause,

and knew the grace of God in truth: by "the grace of God" may be meant
the love and favour of God, in the mission and gift of his Son, to be
the Saviour and Redeemer of lost sinners, displayed in the Gospel, of
which they had a comfortable experience, it being shed abroad in their
hearts by the Spirit; or the blessings of grace revealed in the Gospel,
as free justification by the righteousness of Christ, full pardon of
sin, according to the riches of grace, and adoption of children, arising
out of the love and free favour of God, of which they had had a real
application made to them through the Gospel, by the Spirit of God; or
rather the doctrine of grace itself, so called because it is a
declaration of the free grace of God in the salvation of sinners and the
means of implanting grace in the heart. This they knew not merely in a
notional and speculative manner, but experimentally; for the Gospel was
not only come to them, but into them; they had a spiritual knowledge of
it, and affection for it; they felt the power of it in their hearts, and
tasted and relished the sweetness of it; and owned and "acknowledged"
it, as the word here used may be rendered; for as with the heart they
believed it so with the mouth they made public profession of it: and
this they did "in truth"; they came by the knowledge of the love of God,
and the blessings of grace, and the doctrines of it, by the Gospel, the
word of truth; in and through that they became acquainted with these
things; and having known and embraced the doctrine of the Gospel of the
grace of God, in the truth of it, without any mixture of error, as it
had been purely, and without adulteration, truly and faithfully preached
by their minister, they professed it truly heartily, and sincerely, and
without hypocrisy; which is another part of their commendation, and
involves in it the praise of their minister also, which is enlarged upon
in the following verses.

[Colossians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 1:7</span></span>

As ye also learned of Epaphras,.... To know the grace of God, believe
the truth of the Gospel, and to own and profess it sincerely,

Our dear fellow servant; a "servant" of Christ he was, and a "fellow"
servant of the apostles, jointly engaged with them in preaching the
Gospel; which character, as it greatly commends Epaphras, and shows him
to be a very considerable preacher of the word, so it expresses the
great humility and condescension of the apostle, in putting him upon a
level with himself, though he was not in that high office of the
apostleship he was. And "dear" this precious servant of Christ was to
him, and his fellow ministers, on account of the grace and gifts
bestowed on him, because of his usefulness in the ministry, and his
faithfulness and integrity in the discharge of it; and whose company and
conversation in the prison greatly endeared him to them, for he was a
fellow prisoner, as well as a fellow servant, [Plm
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023.md). It follows,

who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; one whom Christ had made a
"minister" and not man, who was qualified, and sent forth, and made
successful by him in his service; and who preached none but Christ, and
him crucified, in the business of salvation: and he was a "faithful"
one; one that sought not his own glory, but the glory of him that sent
him; nor to please men, but his master; who concealed no part of his
message, but freely and fully declared the whole; he was faithful to
Christ, who put him into the ministry, and to the souls of men, to whom
he ministered: and therefore it is said, he was such an one "for you";
for them, not for himself; for their spiritual good and advantage; he
sought not theirs, but them; he had a great zeal for them, dearly loved
them, and spent his time and strength, and made use of his gifts and
talents while among them, for their use and benefit.

[Colossians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 1:8</span></span>

Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. Not only their love
to God, and Christ, and to all the saints, which is before mentioned,
but their love to the apostle; though they had only heard of him, and of
his great capacity for, and faithfulness and usefulness in preaching of
the Gospel, which had greatly endeared him to them. This, he says, was
in the Spirit; it was spiritual love, to distinguish it from a carnal
and worldly one; they loved him for the spiritual grace that was in him,
the spiritual gifts bestowed on him, the spiritual service he was
engaged in, and the spiritual usefulness he was of: or they loved him
in, and with their spirits, with all their hearts, sincerely, and
without dissimulation; and though they had never seen him in the flesh,
yet being, as it were, present with him in spirit, their affections were
knit unto him: or this their love was "in the Holy Spirit", as the
Ethiopic version reads it; it was a fruit of the Spirit of God, which he
had implanted in their hearts in regeneration, as is also love to God,
and likewise to Christ.

[Colossians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 1:9</span></span>

For this cause we also,.... Not merely for their love to the apostle,
and the rest that were with him; which sense is too much contracted, and
carries some appearance of meanness and selfishness; but because of
their faith in Christ, their love to all the saints, and the good hope
they had of eternal happiness; and because they had heard the Gospel,
and truly knew it, and sincerely professed it: therefore,

since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire;
which shows that the apostles prayed without ceasing; not that they were
every moment praying, without intermission, but that they were frequent
and constant every day at the throne of grace; and as often as they were
there, they were mindful of these Colossians, even ever since they heard
of their reception of the Gospel, of their profession of it, and of the
fruit it brought forth in them; and in their petitions "prayed" and
"desired", earnestly and importunately entreated God on their behalf:

that ye might he filled with the knowledge of his will; the will "of
God", as the Syriac version reads it, by which is meant, not the secret
will of God, according to the counsel of which he does all things in
nature, providence, and grace, but his revealed will; and that either as
it is signified in the law, which declares the good, and perfect, and
acceptable will of God, relating to what he would have done, or avoided
by his creatures; or rather, as it is exhibited in the Gospel, which
contains the will of God respecting the salvation of his chosen ones; as
that it is his will that Christ should obtain eternal redemption for
them, to do which he voluntarily substituted himself in their room, came
into this world, and has accomplished it; and that all those that are
redeemed by Christ should be regenerated by the Spirit; and that whoever
sees the Son, and believes in him, should not perish, but have
everlasting life; as also, that all those whom he has chosen in Christ,
and given to him, and he has redeemed by his blood, and who are
sanctified by his Spirit, none of them should be lost, but that they
should be all saved with an everlasting salvation. Now the apostle does,
not pray that they might have a "knowledge" of this will of God, for
some knowledge of it they had already; they had heard of the hope laid
up in heaven, in the truth of the word of the Gospel; they had not only
had the external, revelation, and had heard the Gospel outwardly
preached, but they had known truly the grace of God; and therefore what
he asks for is, that they might be "filled" with the knowledge of it;
which supposes that they had knowledge, but it was not full and
complete; it was imperfect, as is the knowledge of the best of saints in
this life; and that they might have a larger measure of it, and such a
fulness of it as they were capable of in the present state, and not such
an one as the saints will have in heaven, when they shall know even as
they are known. He adds,

in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; his meaning is, that they
might be led into all the wisdom of God, which is so largely displayed
in the revelation of his will concerning the salvation of his people,
which is made in the Gospel; which is the manifold wisdom of God,
wherein he has abounded in all wisdom and prudence; and contains such a
scheme of things, so wisely contrived and formed, that angels desire to
look into it; and that they might have a "spiritual understanding" of
the mysteries of grace, without which they cannot be discerned to
spiritual advantage, nor indeed without the spirit of wisdom and
revelation in the knowledge of them: and the Ethiopic version renders
it, by "the prudence of the Holy Ghost": who searches the deep things of
God, and reveals them to the saints, and improves and increases their
spiritual and experimental knowledge of them, which is what is here
intended.

[Colossians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 1:10</span></span>

That ye might walk worthy of the Lord,.... The Vulgate Latin version
reads, "of God"; to which the Ethiopic version agrees; but rather the
Lord Jesus Christ seems to be designed: and to "walk worthy" of him, is
to walk by faith in him; to walk after his Spirit, and according to his
word, and in his ordinances; to have the conversation as becomes his
Gospel, and worthy of that calling wherewith the saints are called by
grace to the obtaining of his kingdom and glory. The apostle prays that
their knowledge might issue in practice; for knowledge, without
practice, is of no avail: he first asks for knowledge, and then
practice, for how should men act according to the will of God, or
Christ, unless they know it? and when they know it, they should not rest
in their knowledge, but put it in practice:

unto all pleasing. The Syriac reads it, "that ye may please God in all
good works": an unregenerate man cannot please God in anything; without
faith in Christ it is impossible to please him by anything man can do;
Christ only could, and did always the things that pleased his Father;
there are many things done by believers which are displeasing to God;
nor is there anything they can do that is pleasing to God but through
Christ, in whom their persons and, services are accepted; good works
being done in faith, and from a principle of love, and with a view to
the glory of God, are acceptable unto him through Christ; and therefore
are to be carefully maintained, and studiously performed by all those
that have a spiritual understanding of the will of God, and believe in
Christ their Lord and Redeemer:

being fruitful in every good work; saints are trees of righteousness,
the planting of the Lord; good works are the fruit, which, under the
influence of divine grace, they bring forth; and this is not of one sort
only, as trees usually do, but of every kind; being ingrafted into
Christ the true vine, and deriving life, sap, and nourishment from him,
they are filled with the fruits of righteousness by him, which they
bring forth and bear, to the glory of his heavenly Father; and being
such, they are pleasant plants to him, as fruit bearing trees are to the
owner of them: wherefore, in order to the saints walking in their lives
and conversations unto all pleasing, or pleasing in all things, the
apostle prays they might be fruitful in good works, and that in
everyone, in every kind of good works:

and increasing in the knowledge of God; not barely of his nature and
perfections, as they are displayed in the works of creation; but of his
mind, and will, and the mysteries of his grace, as they are revealed in
the Gospel; of the knowledge of him in Christ, as the God of all grace,
and as a covenant God and Father. The apostle had before prayed for an
increase of the knowledge of the will of God, previous to his request,
for the putting of it in practice; and now suggests, that an increase of
the knowledge of God himself may be expected in a practical use of
means, an attendance on the ordinances of Christ, and a diligent
performance of good works: from the whole of these petitions, it may be
observed by the apostle's asking for them, that all our knowledge, and
the increase of it, and all our fruitfulness in good works, are all from
the Lord; and therefore we have no reason to boast of our knowledge, nor
depend upon our works, but frankly to own, that notwithstanding all we
know, and do, we are but unprofitable servants.

[Colossians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 1:11</span></span>

Strengthened with all might,.... This is still a continuation of the
apostle's prayer for these believers; for having prayed for an increase
of spiritual knowledge, and that this might be put into practice, he
proceeds to pray for strength for them, that they might be enabled to
practise what they had knowledge of; to walk worthily, to please God in
all things, to bring forth fruit with patience, to persevere in
knowledge, practice, fruitfulness, and in an increase thereof. It
implies, that believers are weak in themselves, and insufficient to do
or bear anything of themselves, but stand in need of strength from
above, even of "all might"; of all kind of spiritual might and strength,
proportionate to the various kinds of services, temptations, and trials
they are called unto, and exercised with: they have need of every kind,
degree, and supply of strength, to enable them to resist the temptations
of Satan, to stand against them, and bear up under them; to oppose the
corruptions of their own nature, that great company which comes upon
them, wars against them, threatens to carry them captive, and destroy
them, and against which they have no power of their own; to bear the
cross, which, without the presence and grace of Christ, is very heavy,
and all afflictions and adversities of every sort, which are grievous to
the flesh, and at which it recoils; to perform the various duties of
religion, and the whole of the work of their generation; which though
they have a will unto, yet often know not how to perform, they want
renewed strength their souls; and also to persevere in faith and
holiness, and hold on and out to the end: and which strength they cannot
expect to have from themselves, or from any creature, but

according to his glorious power; the glorious power of God. Power
belongs to God, is a perfection of his nature, and has been, and is
gloriously displayed in many things; as in the creation of the heavens
and the earth; in the upholding of all things in their being; in the
redemption and salvation of sinners; in their faith and conversion; in
supporting the saints under various trials and exercises; and in the
safe keeping them through faith unto salvation: from this glorious power
of God saints may hope to be supplied with all might, or a sufficient
supply of strength for every service, and for every difficulty; as also
from the grace that is in Christ, who has strength as well as
righteousness for his people, who is the glorious power and arm of the
Lord, without whom they can neither do, nor bear anything, but through
him strengthening them, they can do, and bear all things; as likewise
from the Spirit of the Lord, who is the finger of God, by whom Christ
wrought his miracles; and is that glorious power from on high, with
which the apostles being endued, did the wondrous things they did; and
it is by the same Spirit that believers are strengthened with might in
the inner man:

unto all patience; to bring forth fruit with patience; to run with
patience the race set before them; to bear patiently all afflictions and
tribulations; to wait patiently for the things promised by God, and for
the coming and appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the heavenly
glory or hope laid up for them in heaven:

and longsuffering; to be slow to anger, and not easily provoked to
wrath; to be ready to forgive injuries; and to bear long, and with
patience, all reproaches and persecutions for the sake of Christ, and
his Gospel; all which require daily fresh supplies of grace and
strength, especially to endure all

with joyfulness, as well as with patience and longsuffering, with a
cheerful spirit, or with joy in the Holy Ghost; to esteem reproach for
Christ's sake above the riches and honours of this world; to rejoice
when counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. This requires strength
above that of nature, and a renewed supply of that of grace. This last
clause, "with joyfulness", the Syriac version connects with the
following verse, reading it, "with joy do ye give thanks", &c.

[Colossians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 1:12</span></span>

Giving thanks unto the Father,.... To God the Father, as the Vulgate
Latin and the Syriac versions read the clause; and the Complutensian
edition, and some copies, "God and the Father"; who is both the Father
of Christ by nature, and of all his people by adoption. The Ethiopic
version renders it, as an exhortation or advice, "give ye thanks to the
Father"; and so the Syriac version: but the words rather seem to be
spoken in the first, than in the second person, and are to be considered
in connection with [Col 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md). So when
the apostle had made an end of his petitions, he enters upon
thanksgiving to God:

which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints
in light; by the "inheritance", or "lot", is meant not the common lot of
the children of God to suffer persecution for the sake of Christ, and
through much tribulation to enter into the kingdom, which they are by
God the Father counted and made worthy of, with the rest of saints
called out of darkness into light; nor their present state and
condition, having a power to become the children of God, and to be
fellow citizens with the saints, to enjoy communion with them, under the
Gospel dispensation, called "light", in opposition to Jewish and Gentile
darkness, to be brought into which state is an high favour of God; but
the heavenly glory, so called, in allusion to the land of Canaan, which
was divided by lot to the children of Israel, according to the will and
purpose of God; and because it is not acquired by the works of men, but
is a pure free grace gift of God, and which he, as the Father of his
people, has bequeathed unto them; and which they enjoy through the death
of the testator Christ; and of which the Spirit is the earnest; and
because this glory is peculiar to such as are the children of God by
adopting grace. It is no other than that inheritance which is
incorruptible and undefiled, and which fades not away, reserved in the
heavens; and designs that substance, or those solid and substantial
things they shall possess hereafter; that kingdom, salvation, and glory,
they are heirs of; and includes all things they shall inherit, and even
God himself, who is their portion, their inheritance, their exceeding
great reward, and of whom they are said to be heirs. This is the
inheritance "of the saints", and of none else; who are sanctified or set
apart by God the Father in eternal election; who are sanctified by the
blood of Christ, or whose sins are expiated by his atoning sacrifice;
who are sanctified in Christ, or to whom he is made sanctification; and
who are sanctified by the Spirit of Christ, or have the work of
sanctification begun upon their souls by him; in consequence of which
they live soberly, righteously, and godly in the world. And this
inheritance of theirs is "in light"; unless this clause should be read
in connection with the word "saints", and be descriptive of them; they
being called and brought out of darkness into light, and made light in
the Lord, light being infused into them; in which light they see light,
sin to be exceeding sinful, and Christ to be exceeding precious: or this
phrase should be thought to design the means by which the Father makes
meet to partake of the inheritance; namely, in or by the light of the
Gospel, showing the way of salvation by Christ, and by the light of
grace put into their hearts, and by following Christ the light of the
world, which is the way to the light of life: though it rather seems to
point out the situation and nature of the heavenly inheritance; it is
where God dwells, in light inaccessible to mortal creatures, and who is
light itself; and where Christ is, who is the light of the new
Jerusalem; and where is the light of endless joy, and uninterrupted
happiness; and where the saints are blessed with the clear, full, and
beatific vision of God in Christ, and of Christ as he is, seeing him,
not through a glass darkly, but face to face. This may be said in
reference to a notion of the Jews, that the "light" which God created on
the first day is that goodness which he has laid up for them that fear
him, and is what he has treasured up for the righteous in the world to
come (d). Now the saints meetness for this is not of themselves; by
nature they are very unfit for it, being deserving of the wrath of God,
and not of an inheritance; and are impure and unholy, and so not fit to
partake of the inheritance of saints, or Holy Ones, and much less to
dwell and converse with an holy God; and being darkness itself, cannot
bear such light, or have communion with it: but God the Father makes
them meet, which includes all the acts of his grace towards them, upon
them, and in them; such as his choosing them in Christ, and their
inheritance for them; in preparing that for them, and them for that;
blessing them with all grace, and all spiritual blessings in Christ;
putting them among the children by an act of adoption, of his own
sovereign will and free grace, and thereby giving them a goodly
heritage, and a title to it; justifying them by the righteousness of his
Son, and so making them heirs according to the hope of eternal life, and
forgiving all their trespasses for Christ's sake; cleansing them from
all in his blood, so that being the undefiled in the way, without spot
or wrinkle, or any such thing, they are fit for the undefiled
inheritance; regenerating them by his Spirit, and implanting principles
of light and life, grace and holiness, in them, without which no man
shall see the Lord, or enter into the kingdom of heaven. One copy, as
Beza observes, reads it, "which hath called us to be partakers", &c. and
so does the Ethiopic version. And all such as the Father has thus
called, and made meet, shall certainly be partakers of the inheritance;
they partake of it already in Christ their head, and in faith and hope,
having the Spirit as an earnest and pledge of it, and will wholly and
perfectly enjoy it hereafter: for though, like Canaan's land, it is
disposed of by lot, by the will, counsel, and free grace of God, yet
will it not be divided into parts as that was; there is but one
undivided inheritance, but one part and portion, which all the saints
shall jointly and equally partake of, having all and each the same right
and title, claim and meetness. For which they have abundant reason to
give thanks to the Father, when they consider what they were, beggars on
the dunghill, and now advanced to sit among princes, and to inherit the
throne of glory; were bankrupts, over their head in debt, owed ten
thousand talents, and had nothing to pay, and now all is frankly,
forgiven; and besides, a title to, and meetness for, the heavenly
inheritance, are freely bestowed on them; and particularly when they
consider they are no more worthy of this favour than others that have no
share in it, and also how great the inheritance is,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 1:13</span></span>

Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness,.... That is, from the
power of Satan; see [Act 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018.md), who,
though once an angel of light, is now darkness itself, and is reserved
in chains of darkness; he is a ruler of the darkness of this world; his
kingdom is a kingdom of darkness; and he blinds the minds of them that
believe not, keeps them in darkness, and increases the natural darkness
of their minds; he delights in works of darkness, and tempts men to
them; and his everlasting state and portion will be blackness of
darkness: his power over men, in a state of unregeneracy, which he
usurps, and is suffered to exercise, is very great; he works effectually
in them, and leads them captive at his will; and nothing less than the
power of God, who is stronger than the strong man armed, can deliver out
of his hands; and which is at least one part of the mercy for which
thanks are here given; See Gill on [Luk
22:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053.md); with the Jews, one of the names
of Satan is "darkness" (e). Moreover, the darkness of sin, ignorance,
and unbelief, with which God's elect, while in a state of nature, are
surrounded, and, as it were shut up and imprisoned, so that they have
not the least spark of true spiritual light and knowledge, may be also
meant; under the power of which they are to such a degree, that they
know nothing of God in Christ, of the way of salvation by him, or of the
work of the Spirit on their souls, or of the doctrines of the Gospel in
an experimental manner; and so they continue, till, by an almighty
power, they are turned from darkness to light; when, by powerful grace,
they are plucked as brands out of the burning, and delivered from wrath
to come, and from that utter darkness of misery and destruction their
ways of sin and darkness led and exposed them to. This deliverance is
wrought out for them in the effectual calling, when they are internally
called, and powerfully brought out of this darkness, by introducing
light into them, revealing Christ in them, causing the prince of
darkness to flee from them, and the scales of darkness and blindness to
fall from their eyes; and which is both an instance or the wonderful
grace of God, and of his almighty power, and in which lies in part the
saints' meetness for the inheritance; for these words are, in some sort,
explanative of the former; for so long as a person is under the power of
darkness, he cannot be meet for an inheritance which is in light: it
follows, as another branch of this mercy, for which thanks are given,

and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son; not into the
kingdom of glory; for though the saints are heirs of it, and rejoice in
hope of it, they have not yet an entrance into it; which they will have
abundantly when Christ shall introduce them into it, not only as his
Father's, but as his own kingdom and glory: but the kingdom of grace is
here meant, or that state of grace, light, and life, which such are
brought into, when rescued out of Satan's hands, and recovered out of
their former state of ignorance and infidelity; when they are by the
drawings of the Father, by his powerful and efficacious grace, brought
to Christ, and, in the day his power on their souls, are made willing to
submit to his righteousness, and to embrace him as the alone Saviour and
Redeemer, and be subject to him as King of saints, observing his
commands, keeping his ordinances, and walking in his statutes and
judgments with other saints, in a Gospel church state; which is Christ's
kingdom here on earth, where he reigns as King over God's holy hill of
Zion, being set there by his Father, from whom he has received this
kingdom, and will deliver it to him, when it is complete and perfect.
Now those whom Jehovah the Father snatches out of Satan's hands, and
breaks in upon their souls with divine light and knowledge, he brings
into such a state, and into this kingdom of Christ, who is called "his
dear Son": or "the Son of his love"; or "his Son of love"; who being his
Son by nature, of the same nature with him, and equal to him, always
was, is, and will be, the object of his love, complacency, and delight;
as he cannot be otherwise, since he is the brightness of his glory, and
the express image of his person; and even as this Son of his is in an
office capacity, as the Mediator between God and man, he is his elect,
in whom his soul delights; and he is always well pleased with all the
chosen ones in him, who are the sons of God through him, and always
beloved in him. This clause is added, partly to distinguish the kingdom
of Christ, into which the saints are brought in this life, from the
kingdom of the Father, or the ultimate glory they shall possess
hereafter; and partly to express the security of the saints, and their
continuance in the love of God, being in the kingdom, and under the care
and government of the Son of his love; and also to make way for what the
apostle has further to discourse concerning the person, office, and
grace of Christ, in the following verses,

[Colossians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 1:14</span></span>

In whom we have redemption,.... Which is an excellent and wonderful
blessing of grace saints have in and by Christ; and lies in a
deliverance from sin, all sin, original and actual, under which they are
held captive, in a state of nature, and by which they are made subject
to the punishment of death; but through the sacrifice of Christ it is
taken, and put away, finished, and made an end of; and they are freed
from the damning power of it, or any obligation to punishment for it;
and in consequence of this are delivered from the enslaving governing
power of it by his grace and Spirit, and will hereafter be entirely rid
of the very being of it: it consists also of a deliverance from the law,
the curse and bondage of it, under which they are held on account of
sin, the transgression of it; but being delivered from sin, they are
also from the law, its accusations, charges, menaces, curses, and
condemnation; as likewise out of the hands of Satan, by whom they are
led captive; for through the ransom price paid by Christ they are
ransomed out of the hands of him that was stronger than they, the prey
is taken from the mighty, and the lawful captive delivered by him that
has led captivity captive: in short, this redemption is a deliverance
out of the hands of all their enemies, and from all evils and misery,
the effects of sin, from death, and hell, and wrath to come. The author
of it is Christ, the Son of God, the Son of his love, his dear Son: he
was called to this work in the council of peace, in which the affair of
redemption was consulted; and he agreed to undertake it in the covenant
of grace, of which this is a principal article; and being in his
constitution, as Mediator, every way fit and proper for it: as man, the
right of redemption belonged to him, being the near kinsman of his
people, and, as God, he was mighty and able to perform it; as man he had
something to offer, and, as God, could make that sacrifice valuable and
effectual to all saving purposes; as man, he had compassion on human
nature, and, as God, was concerned for things pertaining to his honour
and glory. And thus being every way qualified, he was sent, and came on
this errand, and has obtained a redemption, which is precious,
plenteous, complete and eternal: it is now with him, and "in him"; and
he is made this, and everything else to his people, that they want. The
subjects of this blessing are, not angels, but men; and not all men, but
some that are redeemed from among men, out of every kindred, tongue,
people, and nation; who are called by the name of Jacob, the people of
Christ, a peculiar people, and the church of God; and evidentially are
such, who have faith in Christ, love to the saints, and good hope of
eternal life; who know the grace of God in truth, are made meet to be
partakers of the eternal inheritance, being delivered from the power of
darkness, and translated into the kingdom of Christ, and are designed by
the we in this text: the means by which this blessing is procured, it

through his blood. This phrase is left out indeed in the Syriac and
Ethiopic versions, and in the Complutensian edition, and in some copies;
but rightly stands here, as it does in [Eph
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md), where there is another clause
added, which is here omitted, at the end of the verse, "according to the
riches of his grace". This is the blood of Christ, his own blood, and
not the blood of bulls and goats, and the same with that of the persons
he redeems, but untainted with sin; the blood of Christ, as of a lamb
without spot and blemish, of original or actual sin, otherwise it would
not have been a sufficient redemption price for his people; nor even
then, were it not as it was the blood of the Son of God, of one that was
God as well as man, whereby it came to have a proper value and efficacy
in it to obtain this blessing: Christ's shedding his blood freely on
this account is a proof of his great love to his redeemed ones; the
efficacy that was in it to answer this purpose shows the dignity and
greatness of his person; and it not being to be effected without it,
demonstrates the strictness of divine justice, and that the redemption
of men is brought about in a way entirely consistent with the
righteousness and holiness of God. A particular branch of this blessing
follows, and which serves, in some sense, to illustrate and explain it,

even the forgiveness of sins; of all sin, original and actual; of heart,
lip, and life, secret and open, past, present, and to come; which lies
in a non-imputation of sin, a remembrance of it no more, a removing of
it entirely out of the way, a covering and blotting it out of sight, so
as to be no more visible and legible: this is in Christ, where all
spiritual blessings are; nor is it to be had or expected from an
absolute God, but from God in Christ, and through him, through his
propitiatory sacrifice; for as redemption, so forgiveness of sin is
through his blood, which was shed for it; so that it proceeds upon the
foot of satisfaction made to the justice of God by a price paid, and is
an act of justice as well as grace, and belongs to the same persons as
redemption does; hence those that are redeemed are represented as
without fault before the throne; and indeed, the reason why their
iniquities are blotted out, and will be remembered no more against them,
is, because they are redeemed.

[Colossians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 1:15</span></span>

Who is the image of the invisible God,.... Not of deity, though the
fulness of it dwells in him; nor of himself, though he is the true God,
and eternal life; nor of the Spirit, who also is God, and the Spirit of
the Son; but the Father, called "God", not to the exclusion of the Son
or Spirit, who are with him the one God: "and he is invisible"; not to
the Son who lay in his bosom, and had perfect and infinite knowledge of
him; nor, in some sense, to angels, who always behold his face, but to
men: no man hath seen him corporeally with the eyes of his body, though
intellectually with the eyes of the understanding, when enlightened; not
in his essence and nature, which is infinite and incomprehensible, but
in his works of creation, providence, and grace; nor immediately, but
mediately, in and through Christ, in whom he gives the light of the
knowledge of the glory of his person and perfections; and this not
perfectly now, but in the other state, when the saints shall see him
face to face. But chiefly the Father is said to be invisible, because he
did not appear to Old Testament saints; as his voice was never heard, so
his shape was never seen; he never assumed any visible form; but
whenever any voice was heard, or shape seen, it was the second person
that appeared, the Son of God, who is here said to be his "image", and
that, as he is the Son of God; in which sense he is the natural,
essential, and eternal image of his Father, an eternal one, perfect and
complete, and in which he takes infinite complacency and delight: this
designs more than a shadow and representation, or than bare similitude
and likeness; it includes sameness of nature and perfections; ascertains
the personality of the Son, his distinction from the Father, whose image
he is; and yet implies no inferiority, as the following verses clearly
show, since all that the Father hath are his. Philo, the Jew (f), often
speaks of the or Word of God, as the image of God. Also, this may be
understood of him as Mediator, in whom, as such, is a most glorious
display of the love, grace, and mercy of God, of his holiness and
righteousness, of his truth and faithfulness, and of his power and
wisdom:

the firstborn of every creature; not the first of the creation, or the
first creature God made; for all things in [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md) are said to be created by him,
and therefore he himself can never be a creature; nor is he the first in
the new creation, for the apostle in the context is speaking of the old
creation, and not the new: but the sense either is, that he was begotten
of the Father in a manner inconceivable and inexpressible by men, before
any creatures were in being; or that he is the "first Parent", or
bringer forth of every creature into being, as the word will bear to be
rendered, if instead of we read which is no more than changing the place
of the accent, and may be very easily ventured upon, as is done by an
ancient writer (g), who observes, that the word is used in this sense by
Homer, and is the same as "first Parent", and "first Creator"; and the
rather this may be done, seeing the accents were all added since the
apostle's days, and especially seeing it makes his reasoning, in the
following verses, appear with much more beauty, strength, and force: he
is the first Parent of every creature, "for by him were all things
created", &c. [Col 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md), or it may be
understood of Christ, as the King, Lord, and Governor of all creatures;
being God's firstborn, he is heir of all things, the right of government
belongs to him; he is higher than the kings of the earth, or the angels
in heaven, the highest rank of creatures, being the Creator and upholder
of all, as the following words show; so the Jews make the word
"firstborn" to be synonymous with the word "king", and explain it by ,
"a great one", and "a prince" (h); see [Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md).

[Colossians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 1:16</span></span>

For by him were all things created,.... This is a reason proving Christ
to be before all creatures, to be the common Parent of them, and to have
the government over them, since he is the Creator of them. The creation
of all things, by him, is not to be understood of the new creation, for
whenever that is spoken of, the word "new" is generally used, or what is
equivalent to it, or some clause or phrase added, which determines the
sense, and is not the case here: besides, all things that are in heaven
are said to be created here: which, to say nothing of the sun, moon, and
stars, which are not capable subjects of the new creation, to restrain
them to angels, cannot be true of them; for as for those who were once
in heaven, but kept not their first estate, and quitted their
habitation, these find no place there any more; they never were, nor
will be renewed and restored by Christ; and as for the good angels,
since they never sinned, they stand in no need of renovation. Moreover,
all things that are on earth are also said to be created by him, and
are, but not anew: for to confine these only to men, all men are not
renewed in the spirit of their minds; all have not faith, nor a good
hope through grace, nor love to God and Christ, the greater part of the
world lies in open wickedness; and all that profess religion are not new
creatures, these are a chosen generation, and a peculiar people:
wherefore these words must be understood, not metaphorically, but
literally; in which sense all things are created by Christ, not by him
as an instrument, but as the efficient cause; for the preposition "by"
does not always signify the former; but sometimes the latter; see [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md); nor to the exclusion of the
Father and Spirit, who, with the Son, were jointly concerned in the
creating of all things out of nothing: and these "all things" can only
refer to the things that are made: eternal things can never be said to
be created; this is a contradiction in terms; the Father is not created
by him, nor he himself as the Son of God, nor the Spirit; but everything
that is made is created by him: hence it follows, that he himself is no
creature, otherwise he must create himself, which also is a
contradiction, since every creature is made by him; and consequently he
must be God, for he that made and built all things is God. These are
divided as to the subject of them, or place where they are, into things

that are in heaven, and that are in earth. The things that are in
heaven, are the things that are in the airy and starry heavens, and in
the heaven of heavens. The things in the airy heavens, the fowls
thereof, were on the fifth day created by him; and the things in the
starry heaven, the sun, moon, and stars, were on the fourth day ordained
by him; and the inhabitants of the third heaven, the angels, were made
by him, [Heb 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md); and, as the Jewish
writers (i) say, on the second day of the creation, though some say on
the fifth. The earth comprehends the whole terraqueous globe, consisting
of land and sea; and the things in it are all that are in the seas, the
fishes and other things in it; and all that are in the bowels of the
earth, as well as on the surface of it, all metals and minerals, all
plants, herbs, and trees, every beast of the forest, the cattle on a
thousand hills, the fowls on the mountains, and the wild beasts of the
field, and all human creatures. Again, these all things are, as to the
quality of them, distributed into

visible and invisible, both in heaven and in earth: the visible things
in heaven are the fowls that fly in the airy heaven, the sun, and moon,
and stars in the starry heaven, and the bodies of those saints that have
been either translated, or raised, in the third heaven; the visible
things in the earth are all creatures, animate and inanimate, rational
and irrational, all bodies, all corporeal and material beings: the
invisible things in earth are not only those that are in the innermost
parts of it, but the spirits or souls of men; and those in heaven are
not the invisible God, Father, Son, and Spirit, but the angels, who are
incorporeal and immaterial spirits, and so invisible: and which,

whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, are
all made by him; by these some understand civil magistrates among men,
and the various degrees and orders of them. By "thrones" they think
kings, or monarchs, are meant, who sit on thrones; and by "dominions",
little petty kings, or lords, dukes, and earls; and by "principalities",
governors of provinces and cities; and by "powers", interior
magistrates; and indeed, political governors are sometimes called
dominions, dignities, principalities, and powers; and there are
different orders of them, the king as supreme, and governors under him;
see [Jde 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008.md). But since these seem
rather to be said of the invisible things in heaven, and to be an
explanation of them, angels may rather be thought to be intended; and
are so called, not as denoting different orders and degrees among them,
which some have rashly ventured to describe, but because of the use that
God makes of them in the government of the world, and the executions of
the various affairs of Providence relating to particular persons and
kingdoms; though these several names are not so much such as the apostle
chose to call them by, as what they were called by others; the three
latter are indeed elsewhere used by himself, [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md); but not the former, "thrones",
which yet are used by Jewish writers, and given to angels. Thus, in a
book of theirs, which they esteem very ancient, and ascribe to the
patriarch Abraham, it is said (k),

"there is no angel in which the name Jehovah is not found, which is
everywhere, as the soul is in every member; wherefore men ought to allow
Jehovah to reign in all the members, , "and in all the thrones", and in
all the angels, and in every member of men.

And elsewhere, speaking of the garments of God,

"by these (say they (l)) , "the holy blessed God created the thrones",
and the angels, and the living creatures, and the "seraphim", and the
heavens, and the earth, and all that he created.

And the thrones in [Dan 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md); are
interpreted (m), of

"the superior princes, , "the spiritual angels", who sit first in the
kingdom; and they are called in the words of the Rabbins, "the throne of
glory"; for so is the way of kings, that their princes sit before them,
everyone on his throne, according to their dignity.

Now the apostle's sense is, that the angels, the invisible inhabitants
of the upper world, are all created by Christ, let them be called by
what names they will, that the Jews, or the false teachers, or any sort
of heretics of those times thought fit to give them, whether they called
them thrones or dominions, &c. And so the Arabic version, rather
interpreting than translating the words, renders them thus, "whether you
say thrones, or whether you mention dominions, or whether you understand
princes, or whether you say powers"; speak of them under what title or
appellation you please, they are all the creatures of the Son of God.
The apostle seems to have in view, and to oppose some notions of some
heretics of his time, the followers of Simon Magus, who held, that the
angels were created by his Helena; or, as others, by what they call
"Ennea", and that these angels created the world, and are to be
worshipped; but he here affirms, that

all things were created by him, by Christ, even all the angels; and
therefore he, and not they, are to be worshipped, a notion he afterwards
takes notice of in the following chapter: and as all things are affirmed
to be created by him, which demonstrates the dignity and deity of his
person, so likewise

for him; that is, for his pleasure, that he may take delight and
complacency in them, and in his own perfections displayed by them; and
for his service and use, as the angels, to worship him and minister to
him and for others, he sends them to: elect men are made to serve and
glorify him with their bodies and spirits, which are his; and even the
non-elect are made to subserve his mediatorial kingdom and interest;
yea, the whole world is built and kept in being purely on his account,
until he has finished the great affair of the salvation of his people,
in the application of it to each of them, as he has completed the
impetration of it; and then he will dissolve the heavens, and burn up
the earth and all the works that are therein: all are made for his
glory, and that end is, and will be answered by them in one way or
another,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 1:17</span></span>

And he is before all things,.... Not only in dignity, being preferable
to angels and men in his nature, names, offices, and works, and worthy
of more honour than all creatures; but he is before them in existence,
as he must needs be, since they are all made by him; he was not only
before John the Baptist, his forerunner, before Abraham who saw his day
and was glad, before the first man was made, but before the angels were
in being, or the heavens and the earth, or any creature were formed; and
therefore must be God, who is from everlasting to everlasting:

and by him all things consist; he upholds all things by the word of his
power; the heavens have their stability and continuance from him; the
pillars of the earth are bore up by him, otherwise that and the
inhabitants of it would be dissolved; the angels in heaven are confirmed
in their estate by him, and have their standing and security in him; the
elector God are in his hands, and are his peculiar care and charge, and
therefore shall never perish; yea, all mankind live and move, and have
their being in him; the whole frame of nature would burst asunder and
break in pieces, was it not held together by him; every created being
has its support from him, and its consistence in him; and all the
affairs of Providence relating to all creatures are governed, directed,
and managed by him, in conjunction with the Father and the blessed
Spirit.

[Colossians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 1:18</span></span>

And he is the head of the body, the church,.... By "the church" is
meant, not any particular congregated church, as the church at Colosse,
or Corinth, or any other; but the whole election of grace, the general
assembly and church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven
in the Lamb's book of life; the church which Christ has given himself
for, and has purchased with his blood, and builds on himself the rock,
and will, at last, present to himself a glorious church without spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing; this is compared to an human body, and
therefore called "the body"; which is but one, consisting of many
members in union with each other, set in their proper places in just
symmetry and proportion to each other, and subservient to one another,
and are neither more nor fewer; see [Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012.md), &c. and of this body, the
church, Christ is "the head"; he was the representative head of this
body of elect men from all eternity, and in time; he is a political head
of them, or in such sense an head unto them, as a king is to his
subjects; he reigns in them by his Spirit and grace, and rules them by
wholesome laws of his own enacting, and which he inscribes on their
hearts, and he protects and defends them by his power; he is an
economical head, or in such sense an head of them, as the husband is the
head of the wife, and parents and masters are the heads of their
families, he standing in all these relations to them; and he is to them
what a natural head is to an human body; of all which See Gill on [Co1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003.md). The Messiah is called one head,
in [Hos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011.md); which Jarchi explains by
David their king, and Kimchi on the place says, this is the King
Messiah:

who is the beginning; which either denotes the eternity of Christ, who
was not only in the beginning, and was set up from the beginning, from
everlasting, but is also the beginning and the end; and who is, indeed,
without beginning of days, or end of life: or his dominion; he is the
principality, as the word may be rendered; he is the principality of
principalities, the head of all principality and power, the angels; he
is the Prince of the kings of the earth; he is King of saints; the
kingdom of nature and providence is his, and the government of his
people in a special manner is on his shoulders: or this may design his
being the first cause of all things; he is the beginning of the creation
of God; the efficient cause of all created beings; he is the beginning
of the church, of which he is the head; as Eve was from Adam, so is the
church from Christ; it is a body of his preparing, and a temple of his
building, and where he sits as a priest on his throne, and has the
government of it: the second number, wisdom, in the cabalistic tree of
the Jews, is called "the beginning" (n), as is the Logos, or Word, by
Philo the Jew (o):

the firstborn from the dead; the first that rose from the dead by his
own power, and to an immortal life; for, though others were raised
before him, and by him, yet not to a state of immortality; the path of
life, to an immortal life, was first shown to him as man; and who also
is the firstfruits of them that sleep, and so the pledge and earnest of
the future resurrection of the saints; and is both the efficient and
exemplary cause of it; the resurrection of the dead will be by him as
God, and according to his own, as man:

that in all things he might have the pre-eminence; or might be the first
and chief over all persons, angels, and men; having a superior nature,
name, and place, than the former, and being the firstborn among many
brethren designed by the latter: and in all things he is the first, and
has the precedence and primacy; in sonship, no one is a Son in the sense
he is; in election, he was chosen first, and his people in him; in the
covenant, he is the surety, Mediator, and messenger of it, he is that
itself; in his human nature, he is fairer than the children of men; in
redemption, he was alone, and wrought it out himself; in life, he
exceeded all others in purity, in doctrine, and miracles; and in dying
he conquered death, and rose first from it; in short, he died, revived,
and rose again, that he might be Lord both of dead and living; and he
ought to have the pre-eminence and first place in the affections of our
hearts, in the contemplations of our minds, in the desires of our souls,
and in the highest praises of our lips,

[Colossians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">col 1:19</span></span>

For it pleased the Father,.... The phrase, "the Father", is not in the
original text, but is rightly supplied; since he is expressly mentioned
in the context, as he who makes the saints meet to be partakers of the
heavenly glory; who deliver, them from the power and dominion of sin,
and translates them into the kingdom of his dear Son; and who, by
Christ, reconciles all things to himself, [Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md), and whose sovereign will and
pleasure it is,

that in him should all fulness dwell: by which is meant, not the fulness
of the deity, though it is read by some the fulness of the Godhead:
which seems to be transcribed from [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md); but though all the perfections of
God are in Christ, as eternity, omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence,
immutability, independence, and necessary existence, and every other, or
he would not be equal with God; nor could all the fulness of the Godhead
be said to dwell in him, should anyone be wanting; yet this is a fulness
possessed by him, that does not spring from, nor depend upon the
Father's good will and pleasure; but what he naturally and necessarily
enjoys by a participation of the same undivided nature and essence with
the Father and Spirit: nor is the relative fulness of Christ intended,
which is his church, so called, [Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md); and will be so when all the
elect are gathered in, and filled with all the gifts and graces of his
Spirit, and are arrived to the measure of the stature of the fulness of
Christ; for though every believer dwells in Christ, and Christ in him,
yet the church is not said to dwell in Christ, but Christ in the church;
moreover, as yet she is not his fulness, at least in the sense she will
be, and much less can she be said to be all fulness: nor is this to be
understood of Christ's fulness of fitness and abilities, as God-man and
Mediator, to perform his work and office as such; though this may be
taken into the sense of the text as a part, yet is not the whole; but
rather chiefly that dispensatory communicative fulness, which is, of the
Father's good will and pleasure, put into the hands of Christ to be
distributed to others, is here designed. There is a fulness of nature in
Christ; the light of nature is from him, and communicated by him to
mankind; the blessings of nature are the blessings of his left hand,
which he distributes to his people as he thinks fit; and all things in
nature are subservient to his mediatorial kingdom and glory. There is a
fulness of grace in him, out of which saints receive, and grace for
grace, or a large abundance of it; the fulness of the spirit of grace,
and of all the graces and gifts of the Spirit is in him; and of all the
blessings of grace, as a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin,
adoption, sanctification, even of all that grace that is implanted in
regeneration, that is necessary to carry on and finish the good work
upon the soul; there is a fulness of all light and life, of wisdom, and
strength, of peace, joy, and comfort, and of all the promises of grace,
both with respect to this world and that which is to come; and there is
also a fulness of glory in him, not only the grace, but the glory of the
saints, is laid up and hid with him, and is safe and secure in him: this
is said to dwell in Christ, which implies its being in him; it is not
barely in intention, design, and purpose, but it is really and actually
in him, nor is it in any other; and hence it comes to be communicated to
the saints: and it also denotes the continuance of it with him; it is an
abiding fulness, and yields a continual daily supply to the saints, and
will endure to the end of time, and be as sufficient for the last as the
first believer; it is like the subject of it, the same yesterday, today,
and for ever: and it also intends the safety of it: the saints' life
both of grace and glory is hid with Christ, and is secure, it is out of
the reach of men and devils, and can never be lost, or they deprived of
it; and all this is owing not to any merits of men, to their faith and
holiness, or good works, which are all the fruits of this fulness, but
to the good will of God; "it pleased the Father" to place it here for
them; it was owing to his good will to his Son, and therefore he puts
all things into his hands; and to his elect in him, for, having loved
them with an everlasting love, he takes everlasting care of them, and
makes everlasting provision for them; it was his pleasure from all
eternity to take such a step as this, well knowing it was not proper to
put it into the hands of Adam, nor into the hands of angels, nor into
their own at once; he saw none so fit for it as his Son, and therefore
it pleased him to commit it unto him; and it is his good will and
sovereign pleasure, that all grace should come through Christ, all
communion with him here, and all enjoyment of him hereafter; which
greatly enhances and sets forth the glory of Christ as Mediator, one
considerable branch of which is, that he is full of grace and truth;
this qualifies him to be the head of the church, and gives a reason, as
these words be, why he has, and ought to have, the preeminence in all
things.

[Colossians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">col 1:20</span></span>

And by him to reconcile all things to himself,.... This depends upon the
preceding verse, and is to be connected with that phrase in it, it
pleased the Father, [Col 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md); and the
sense is, that it was the good will and pleasure of God from all
eternity, as to lay up all fulness in Christ for his chosen people, so
to reconcile them to himself by him; and which is another reason why
Christ is, and ought to be considered as the head of the church, whose
reconciliation he has procured, and why he ought to have the chief place
in all things, and among all persons. Reconciliation supposes a former
state of amity and friendship, and in such an one man was originally
with God; and a breach of that friendship, which was made and issued in
real enmity in the heart of man; and also a restoration to friendship
again: and it is to be understood not of a reconciliation of God to men,
which the Scriptures nowhere speak of, but of men to God; and is a
reconciliation of them, not to the love of God, which his elect always
shared in, but to the justice of God, offended by the transgression of a
righteous law; and is indeed properly a reconciliation, atonement, and
satisfaction for their sins, and so of their persons, and whereby all
the perfections of God are reconciled to and agree with each other in
the salvation of such sinners: now this takes its first rise from God
the Father; it is owing to his sovereign good will and pleasure; he took
the first step towards it; he knew what a state of enmity and rebellion
his people would fall into; his thoughts ran upon their peace and
reconciliation from everlasting; he called a council of peace about it,
and in it drew the model of it; he entered into a covenant of peace with
his Son, and, in consequence of it, sent him in the fulness of time to
effect it, laying on him the chastisement of their peace; it was his
pleasure that this affair of reconciliation should be brought about, not
by the means of angels, in whom he could put no such trust and
confidence, and who, though they rejoice at peace being made on earth,
could never have effected it; nor that it should be done by men, who
have no knowledge of the way of it, no inclination to it, nor power to
make it; but "by him", his Son Jesus Christ, whom he appointed and
called to this work, and sent to do it; and who is therefore, in
prophecy, before this reconciliation was actually made, styled "Shiloh",
the Prince of peace, and the peace: and this, when made, was made "to
himself"; meaning either to Christ, in whom all the elect were gathered
together, as in one head, and were reconciled in one body, whether Jews
or Gentiles, through him; or rather to God the Father, to whom they were
enemies, yea, enmity itself, and to whom the satisfaction and atonement
were made; it being his law that was broken, and his justice that was
injured, and to whom they are always in Scripture said to be reconciled;
though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit, the one God with the
Father: moreover, the sense of this phrase may be, that the
reconciliation of the elect made by Christ, in a way of full
satisfaction to law and justice, is to the glory of God, the glory of
all his perfections; as of his grace and mercy, wisdom, power, and
faithfulness, so of his righteousness and holiness: the means by which
Christ has enacted it are, his sacrifice, sufferings, and death,
expressed in the following clause,

having made peace through the blood of his cross. This was what man
could not do, what Christ was appointed and sent to do, and what he was
every way qualified for as God and man; as man he had blood to shed, and
could make reconciliation for sin in the nature which had sinned, and,
as God, could draw nigh to his Father, and treat with him about terms of
peace, and perform them; and so a fit daysman and Mediator between, God
and man: this peace he has made by his "blood", that is, by the shedding
of it, by his death as a sacrifice, which he underwent on the cross;
partly to denote the shame, and chiefly to signify the curse he endured
in the room of his people: all which shows the malignant nature of sin,
the strictness of justice, and that peace is made in a way of full
satisfaction, is upon honourable terms, will be lasting, as it is
joyful, being attended with a train of blessings:

by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven: by
which are intended not the whole universe and fabric of the world, all
creatures and things, animate and inanimate, rational and irrational,
which have been cursed for the sin of man, and have proved unfriendly to
him, but, in consequence of redemption and reconciliation by Christ,
will, as some think, in the time of the restitution of all things, be
restored to their former state, and to their friendly use to mankind;
nor elect men and elect angels, and their reconciliation together, for
the apostle is not speaking of the reconciling of these things together,
but of the reconciling of them to God, which though it is true of elect
men, is not of elect angels, who never fell, and though they have
confirming grace, yet not reconciling grace from Christ, which they
never needed; nor Jews and Gentiles, for though it is true that God was
in Christ reconciling the world of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews
to himself, and the chosen of God among both are actually reconciled to
God by the death of Christ, yet the one are never called things in
heaven, or the other things on earth, in distinction from, and
opposition to each other; but rather all the elect of God are here
meant, the family of God in heaven and in earth; all the saints that
were then in heaven, when actual reconciliation was made by the blood of
Christ, and who went thither upon the foot of peace, reconciliation, and
redemption, to be made by his sacrifice and death; and all the chosen
ones that were or should be on the face of the earth, until the end of
time; all these were reconciled to God by Christ: and then the apostle
proceeds particularly to mention the Colossians, as also being instances
of this grace, good will, and pleasure of God by Christ.

[Colossians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">col 1:21</span></span>

And you that were sometime alienated,.... The general blessing of grace
and reconciliation, which belongs to the whole body of Christ, the
church universal, all the elect of God, whether in heaven or in earth,
is here particularly applied to the saints at Colosse, who were eminent
instances of it; and that the free grace of God towards them in it might
more illustriously appear, the apostle takes notice of what they were
before the coming of Christ in the flesh, before the Gospel came among
them, and while in a state of unregeneracy, as that they were
"alienated": that is from God, not from his general presence, power, and
providence, which reach to all his creatures, but from the life of God;
see [Eph 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018.md); from living agreeably
to the will of God, being estranged from him who is the fountain of
moral and spiritual, as well as natural life; from the law, the rule of
life, and from a principle of life in themselves; and altogether
disapproving of such a life, as contrary to their carnal affections and
lusts: and which alienation from God greatly lay in their forsaking him,
the one only and true God, and following and serving strange gods, not
attending to the dictates and light of nature; and being destitute of a
divine revelation, they went further and further off from God, and from
his people, worship, and ordinances; and were aliens from the
commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise; the
source of all which was sin, and was owing to themselves: God did not
alienate himself from them first; they alienated themselves from him;
their sins separated between God and them, set them at a distance from
him, and at enmity to him, and which very early appeared, for they were
estranged from the womb:

and enemies in your mind by wicked works. They were enemies to God, the
true God, and were lovers and worshippers of idols; they were enemies to
the being and perfections of God, as all men in a state of nature are;
and more or less show it, by either denying there is a God, or wishing
there was none, or fancying him to be such an one as themselves; or they
dispute his sovereignty, deny his omniscience, arraign his justice and
faithfulness, and despise the riches of his grace and goodness; they are
enemies to his purposes, providences, and word; cannot bear that he
should determine any thing concerning them or others; their eye is evil
to him because he is good to others; they reply against him, they run
upon him, and charge his decrees with unrighteousness and cruelty;
murmur at and quarrel with the dispensations of his providence, as
unequal and unjust; cast away the law of the Lord, will not be subject
to it, and condemn the revelation of his will. They are enemies to
Christ in one shape or another; either to his person, denying his proper
deity, or real humanity; or to his offices, not hearkening to him as a
prophet, trampling on his blood and sacrifice as a priest, and unwilling
to have him to rule over them as a King; or to the way of salvation by
him, of pardon by his blood, atonement by his sacrifice, justification
by his righteousness, and acceptance with God through his person; or to
his doctrines and ordinances, which are unsuitable to their vicious
tastes, carnal affections, and appetites: they are enemies to the Spirit
of Christ, by either denying his deity and personality, or by ridiculing
the operations of his grace; or treating with contempt, and as foolish,
everything of his, the Bible and all the truths contained in it,
dictated by him. They are enemies to the people of God, exceeding mad
against them, hate them and persecute them, reckon them the faith of the
world, and the offscouring of all things, living in malice to them, and
hateful and hating one another: and this enmity to everything divine and
good is seated "in the mind"; the mind is not the object of this enmity,
as some read the words, "to the mind": for the mind of a carnal man is
enmity itself against God; but it is the subject of it, where it has its
chief place, and from whence it proceeds, and shows itself in evil
actions; and though the word "your" is not in the original text, it is
rightly supplied; for the meaning is not that they were enemies "of his
mind"; of the mind of the Lord, of his counsels and will, as some read
and explain the words, though there is a truth in this, but in their own
minds: so that not the body but the soul is the seat of this enmity; and
not the inferior faculties of the soul only, the sensitive appetite and
passions, but the understanding, the judgment and will, the more noble
and rational powers of the soul; from hence spring all the malice and
enmity expressed in word and actions: where then is man's free will to
that which is good? and hence it is that the mind stands in need of
being renewed, enlightened, cleansed and sanctified, and renovation
begins here, which is the effect of almighty power; for nothing else can
remove the rooted enmity in the heart of men; and which, as deep and as
secret as it is, sooner or later, in one way or another, shows itself
"by wicked works"; and that frequently, as by loving what God hates, and
hating what he loves; by omitting what he commands, and committing what
he forbids; by maintaining friendship with the world, and by harbouring
his professed enemies, and persecuting his dear friends; and by their
wicked words, and evil lives and conversations; and by the various works
of the flesh, which are manifest, some being more directly against God,
others by which they wrong themselves, and others by which they injure
their neighbours:

yet now hath he reconciled; which may be understood either of the
Father's reconciling them to himself by his Son; and so the words are a
continuation of the account of the Father's grace, as to all the elect
in general, so to the Colossians in particular, notwithstanding the
black characters in which they stand described in their natural estate:
or else of Christ's reconciling them to his Father, by the sacrifice of
himself, which he voluntarily offered for them, though this was their
case, and of enemies made them friends: and may be meant either of the
impetration of reconciliation for them by his sufferings and death; or
of the virtue and efficacy of it in the application of it; in the former
sense the "now" refers to the coming of Christ into the world, and the
time of his death, and the offering up of his body once for all, when
peace and reconciliation were completely made at once for all God's
elect; in the latter sense it refers to the time of the conversion of
these Colossians, when Christ by his Spirit, in consequence of
reconciliation made in the body of his flesh, through death reconciled
them to God; to his mind and will, to the way of salvation by himself,
to the saints the excellent in the earth, to the Gospel and the
ordinances of it, and to all his ways and worship.

[Colossians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">col 1:22</span></span>

In the body of his flesh through death,.... Or "through his death", as
the Alexandrian copy and some others, and all the Oriental versions,
read. These words express the means by which that reconciliation was
made, which in the virtue and efficacy of it was applied particularly to
these Colossians at their conversion whereby their minds were actually
reconciled to God, as "in" or "by the body of his flesh"; that is, by
the offering up of his body on the accursed tree, in which he bore the
sins of his people, and made reconciliation for them: and it is so
called either to distinguish it from his mystical and spiritual body the
church, of which he is the head before spoken of; or from his glorious
and immortal body, as now raised and exalted at God's right hand; and to
denote the truth of his human body, that it was a real fleshly body,
consisting of flesh and blood as ours does, and the same with ours, and
not an aerial, celestial bony, or a mere phantom; and also to signify
the infirmity and mortality of it, being, excepting sin, in all points
like to ours, and subject to death; and that it was in that body his
Father prepared for him, and he assumed; and as he was clothed with it
in the days of his flesh, or mortal state, that he made reconciliation
for the sins of his people, and that "through death" in it; even the
death of the cross, by which he bore the penalty of the law, the curse
of it, made satisfaction to justice, obtained life, abolished death, and
destroyed him that had the power of it, and fixed a sure and lasting
peace for all his saints; his end in which was,

to present you holy and unblamable, and unreproveable in his sight. This
presentation of the saints by Christ is either in his own sight, "before
himself", as the Arabic version reads it; and is here in this present
state, they being considered by him both as sanctified and as justified;
he taking delight in the graces of his Spirit, and the exercise of them
on himself, though imperfect, and in them as clothed with his spotless
righteousness, in which they are perfectly comely, all fair, and without
spot: or in the latter day glory, the New Jerusalem church state; when
the church will be as a bride prepared for her husband, will be brought
into his presence in raiment of needlework, in fine linen clean and
white, the righteousness of the saints, and be presented to himself a
glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; or in the
ultimate glory, when all the saints shall be for ever with him,
continually before him, and in his sight; which is what his heart was
set upon from everlasting, which he had in view in his sufferings and
death, and still has in his prayers and preparations: or else this
presentation is what has been or will be made before his Father, and in
his sight; and which was partly done, when he gathered together all the
elect in himself, and represented them on the cross, in the body of his
flesh; and partly is now doing in heaven, where he appears in the
presence of God for them, bears their names on his breastplate, presents
their persons and their cases; and especially will be done at the last
day, when he will deliver up the kingdom to the Father, and say, lo, I
and the children thou hast given me: and who will be presented "holy" by
him; he being their sanctification, and they having all their sins
expiated by his sacrifice, and their persons washed and cleansed in his
blood, and their hearts sanctified by his Spirit; which sanctification
though it is imperfect in this life, yet will be completed by the author
of it at death; without perfect holiness no man shall see God, or be
presented in his sight: and this is in consequence of the death of
Christ and reconciliation by it and a fruit of electing grace, by which
persons are chosen in Christ, that they should be holy and without
blame; and as here, "unblamable and unreproveable": as they are, not now
in themselves, but in Christ, as arrayed with his robe of righteousness
and garments of salvation, being all glorious within, and their clothing
of wrought gold, in which they will be introduced and presented to
himself, and to his Father, faultless, with exceeding joy, and stand so
before the throne, and that to all eternity.

[Colossians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 1:23</span></span>

If ye continue in the faith,.... In the doctrine of faith which they had
received and embraced; and in the grace of faith, and the exercise of it
which was implanted in them; and in the profession of faith which they
had made: not that the virtue and efficacy of Christ's blood,
sufferings, and death, and reconciliation of their persons to God
thereby, depended upon their faith, and abiding in it; but that faith
and continuance in it were necessary means of their presentation in
unblemished holiness and righteousness; for if they had not faith, or
did not abide in it or if the good work of grace was not wrought upon
their souls, and that performed until the day of Christ, they could not
be presented holy and blameless: this shows the necessity of the saints'
final perseverance in faith and holiness, and is mentioned with this
view, to put them upon a concern about it, and to make use of all means,
under divine grace, to enjoy it; and nothing could more strongly incline
and move unto it, than the blessed effect of Christ's death,
reconciliation and the end of it, to present the reconciled ones
blameless; in order to which it is necessary they should hold on and out
to the end: hence the Ethiopic version reads the words, not as a
condition, but as an exhortation enforced by what goes before;
"therefore be ye established in the faith": it follows,

grounded and settled; not on the sandy foundation of man's own
righteousness, and peace made by his own performances; but upon the
foundation and rock, Christ, against which the gates of hell cannot
prevail; and so shall never finally and totally fall away, being rooted
and built up in him, and established in the faith of him, in the
doctrines of faith, respecting peace by his blood, justification by his
righteousness, and life by his death; and so continue steadfast and
immovable, always abounding in his work:

and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel; the hope of eternal
life and happiness, which as set before us in the Gospel; which that
gives a good and solid ground and foundation of, in the person, blood,
and righteousness of Christ; and is the instrumental means, in the hand
of the Spirit, of begetting to it, and of encouraging and increasing it:
the law gives no hopes of eternal life to a poor sinner; it works wrath,
and ministers death; there is nothing but a fearful looking for of
judgment by it; but the Gospel encourages to hope in the Lord, from the
consideration of rich mercy and plenteous redemption in him; and this
hope of the Gospel is an anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast, and not
to be let go; this confidence and rejoicing of the hope is to be kept
firm unto the end:

which ye have heard; that is, which Gospel they had heard from Epaphras
their faithful minister, and that not only externally, but internally;
they had heard it and believed it, and it had brought forth fruit in
them; for it came to them not in word only, but in power; which is said
in commendation of it, and to engage them to continue in it, and abide
by it; as is also what follows:

and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; and
therefore since it was the same which was everywhere preached, they
might depend upon the truth of it, should have the greater value for it,
and by no means relinquish it. This must be understood not of every
individual creature, even human and rational, that was then, or had been
in, the world; but that it had been, and was preached far and near, in
all places all over the world, to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews;
who are sometimes styled "every creature", "the creature", "the whole
creation", "all men", &c. see [Mar
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015.md) [Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md); and of this, the first preaching
of the Gospel by Peter after our Lord's resurrection, was an emblem and
pledge, [Act 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014.md); and some time after
that, the sound of all the apostles went into all the earth, and their
words to the end of the world:

whereof I Paul am made a minister; by Jesus Christ, who appeared unto
him, and called, qualified, and sent him forth as such; and this is
mentioned to encourage the Colossians to abide by the truths of the
Gospel, since what they had heard and received were what were everywhere
preached by the faithful ministers of the word; and particularly by the
apostle, who was ordained to be a teacher and preacher of it to the
Gentiles. The Alexandrian copy reads, "a preacher and an apostle, and a
minister"; see [Ti1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007.md).

[Colossians 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">col 1:24</span></span>

Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you,.... The apostle, as soon as he
had made mention of his being a minister of the Gospel, thinks and
speaks of his "sufferings"; for those are what always more or less
attend persons in such an office; they are appointed to them by God;
Christ has foretold them of them; they are necessary for them; they must
expect them, and patiently endure them: the apostle was under them now
at this present time, for he wrote this epistle in his bonds when a
prisoner at Rome, not for any immorality, any crime he had committed,
but for Christ's sake, for his Gospel's sake, for the sake of the
churches of Christ to whom he preached, for the confirmation of them,
and so of these Colossians; and therefore he says, "for you"; and which
he mentions to animate them to abide by the Gospel, for which he was
suffering, that it might continue with them and others: nor was he
distressed and discouraged at his afflictions, he "rejoiced" in them,
because he had the presence of God in them, the Spirit of God and of
glory rested on him, and God was glorified by them; he esteemed it an
honour done him that grace was given, and he counted worthy to suffer
for the sake of Christ; and as well knowing that he should live and
reign with him, since he suffered with him and for him: and what greatly
caused and increased his joy was what follows,

and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my
flesh; by which are meant not the afflictions or sufferings of Christ in
his own person; for these were all over, he was now entered into his
glory, was exalted at the Father's right hand, and was crowned with
glory and honour: there was nothing left behind of his sufferings, to be
undergone by any of his people; he had drank of the cup and all the
dregs of it; he had sustained the whole of his Father's wrath, and all
the curses of the law, being abated nothing, but was made perfect
through sufferings; having perfectly suffered all, he suffered once and
once for all, he will suffer no more; nor is there any need of his
suffering more or again, for he has finished sin, wrought righteousness,
made peace, and obtained eternal redemption; nor had he any partner in
his sufferings, nor did he need any, or left any part of his sufferings
to be filled up by others; for he endured all and the whole, which the
law and justice of God could require in his own body, in the body of his
flesh through death; of these sufferings the apostle does not speak, but
of such which he filled up in "his" own "flesh"; and design the
afflictions of Christ in his members, which are called "his", because of
that near union there is between Christ and them; so that what befalls
them may be predicated of him; when anyone of them suffers, he suffers
with him, as the sufferings of a part of the body are ascribed to the
whole person; and because of that sympathy there is between them, he has
a fellow feeling with his people in all their infirmities; in all their
afflictions he is afflicted: if Saul persecutes his saints, he
persecutes him; whatever injury is done to them, he takes it as done to
himself, who are to him as the apple of his eye. Moreover, hereby they
are conformed unto him, and made like him; as he was, so are they in
this world; there is a good deal of likeness between the afflictions of
Christ and his people, though in some things there is a great disparity;
add to this, that the afflictions of the saints are endured for Christ's
sake, for the sake of his Gospel, and the profession of his name, and
therefore called his, and the more cheerfully bore by them: now of these
there were some remains to be filled up by the apostle; not that all the
afflictions of the whole body of Christ were to be, or have been filled
up by him; there was a great deal left behind by him to be filled up by
others, and which has been filling up ever since, and still is, and yet
all is not fulfilled to this day, nor will be till the end of time; but
he speaks only of that part and measure of them, which was to be tilled
up in his flesh; he had his measure of afflictions allotted to him,
great part of which he had endured already, but some remained, the
measure was not yet full, though pretty near being completed, which gave
him pleasure; it was just filling up, and the time of his departure was
at hand, when there would be no more sorrow; for it was only while he
was in the flesh he was filling up this measure, and would be quickly
up; and what added to his joy was, that as these were the afflictions of
Christ, and the measure of them was appointed by his heavenly Father, to
be filled up by him in this mortal state, so they were

for his body's sake, which is the church; not in the room and stead of
the church, and people of Christ, as were the sufferings of Christ
personal; or to exempt them from sufferings who all have their share in
this life; nor for their sins to make reconciliation for them, and
procure the remission of them; nor to redeem them, or obtain salvation
for them, all which is completed by Christ; but for their good and
profit, that the Gospel might continue and be blessed to the conversion
of many, for the increase of the church and additions to it, and for the
furtherance of the Gospel, and that such who professed it might be
established and confirmed in it, by the sufferings of the apostle for
it: and such good effects did follow upon his sufferings and
afflictions; they were for the consolation of many souls, the
strengthening of weak believers, and causing even preachers of the
Gospel to wax more confident, and more boldly preach the Gospel without
fear of man.

[Colossians 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">col 1:25</span></span>

Whereof I am made a minister,.... Not of Christ, or of the Gospel as
before, though both were true; but of the churches for whose sake he
endured afflictions; and which carries in it a reason of his suffering
for them: he was not a saviour of the body, nor a redeemer of the
church, nor Lord of it; but a minister, a servant of it, that ministered
to it in holy things, in the word and ordinances; not a deacon, as the
word, sometimes signifies, nor an ordinary minister, or a pastor of a
particular church; but a minister of the church in general, being an
apostle sent to preach the Gospel everywhere: he was made a minister of
it, not by men, or anything he received from men; nor by himself, not by
usurpation, he did not thrust himself into this office, or take it upon
him of himself; but was put into it by Christ, who counted him faithful,
he appeared to him, and made him a minister, qualified him for this
office, called him to it, and sent him to perform it: and which he
executed

according to the dispensation of God: or divine economy, which denotes
such an authority and administration as is used in a family. The church
is God's family, it is called the house and household of God, and the
household of faith, part of which is in heaven and part on earth; God is
the householder or master of the family; Christ is the Son over his own
house; ministers are stewards in it, and their work is to give to
everyone their portion of meat in due season; their authority from God
to do so, and the exercise of it, are the economy or dispensation of the
Gospel committed to them: this is of God and not man, for none but God
can give them a power to dispense it, and which is purely of his grace,
called therefore the dispensation of the grace of God, [Eph
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002.md); and here said to be given,

which is given to me for you; not according to any merits of his, who
was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an injurious person to Christ
and his Gospel; but according to the pure grace of God, and that not for
himself, but for the good of others, for the Gentiles especially, and so
for the Colossians:

to fulfil the word of God; either the promises and prophecies contained
in the word of God, respecting the preaching of the Gospel to the
Gentiles, and their conversion by it; which had in a great measure their
accomplishment through the ministry of the apostle: or to fill all
places with the word of God and Gospel of Christ, as the apostle did
from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, diffusing the savour of
the knowledge of Christ in every place; and sinners being converted,
churches were planted and daily filled with such as should be saved; or
to preach fully and faithfully the Gospel, keeping back nothing that was
profitable, but declaring the whole counsel of God, continuing faithful
to it to the end, as he did: to fill up or fulfil words is an Hebraism,
and signifies to confirm them, or act according to them; see [Kg1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#014.md) and the Septuagint there.

[Colossians 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">col 1:26</span></span>

Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and generations,.... This
is said, as explanative of the word of God; signifying that he did not
mean the Scriptures in general, which are the word of God, and every
part of them; some part of which is historical, another prophetical,
another practical, and another doctrinal; nor the law, which also is the
word of God, but the Gospel, called "the mystery", as it often is;
because it contains things, which, though revealed, are mysteries to a
natural man; and even to enlightened persons, who have the clearest view
of them, the "modus" of them is not to be accounted for; such as the
doctrines of the Trinity, of the union of the two natures in Christ, the
incarnation of the Son of God, the union and communion of the church
with Christ, the resurrection of the dead, &c. And though perhaps great
and special regard may be here had to the calling of the Gentiles,
which, though revealed in the prophecies of the Old Testament, was in a
great measure hid in them, and not so clearly known in ages and
generations past as now, yet the whole may be applied to the Gospel
mystery in general; which was first hid in the heart of God, in his
thoughts and purposes, in his counsel and covenant, and in his Son, in
whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and then in the
ceremonies and shadows of the law, which but few had any insight into,
and discerning of; and, during that dispensation, was wholly hid from
the Gentiles; and but in part known by the Jews, and but by a few, and
comparatively by them very darkly; and not so clearly by the angels
themselves, who pry into these mysteries, and now, under the Gospel
dispensation, learn from the church the manifold wisdom of God; and
indeed it was hidden from all men, Jews and Gentiles, in a state of
nature, and even from the wise and prudent of this world:

but now is made manifest to his saints; now under the Gospel
dispensation, since the coming of Christ; there is an external
revelation of the Gospel by him, more clearly, by whom grace and truth
came, called the revelation of Christ; and an internal revelation of it
by his Spirit, who is the spirit of wisdom and revelation, in the
knowledge of him; which is made to saints, the holy apostles and
prophets, who are the saints to whom this faith, and the mystery of it,
were first delivered with so much power and evidence; and to all the
elect of God, whom he has separated for himself in eternal election;
whom Christ has sanctified by his blood, and to whom he is made
sanctification; and who are called with an holy calling, have principles
of grace and holiness wrought in them by the Spirit of God, and
therefore called "his" saints; these have only a spiritual discerning of
the Gospel, for the natural man neither knows nor receives it.

[Colossians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">col 1:27</span></span>

To whom God would make known,.... The spring and cause of the
manifestation of the Gospel to the saints, and chosen of God, is not
their works, for God does not call them with an holy calling according
to them, but according to his own grace; nor any preparations and
dispositions in them before such manifestation, towards the Gospel and
the truths of it, for there are none such naturally in men, but all the
reverse; nor a foresight of their better improvement of it, when made
known, for this is not the method of divine grace, witness the instances
of Sodom and Gomorrha, Tyre and Sidon; nor any holiness in them, or
because they were sanctified, for they became so by the power of divine
grace, through the Gospel revelation; but it is the pure sovereign good
will and pleasure of God; see [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md); as appears from what they were
before the Gospel came unto them, what is made known to them in it and
by it; and from this, that they and not others, equally as deserving,
are favoured with it:

what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. The
apostle, besides calling the Gospel a "mystery", as before, ascribes
"glory" to it; it is a glorious mystery, there is a glory in all the
mysteries of it; it is a glorious Gospel, as it is often called, in its
author, subject, matter, use, and efficacy: and also "riches" of glory,
or glorious riches; containing rich truths, an immense treasure of them,
comparable to gold, silver, and precious stones; rich blessings of
justification, pardon, reconciliation, adoption, and eternal life; and
rich promises, relating both to this life, and that which is to come;
all which were opened and made known, not to the Jews only, but "among
the Gentiles" also; who before were aliens, enemies, exceeding wicked,
poor, blind, and miserable, but now, through the Gospel, were become
rich and glorious, wise, knowing, and happy:

which is Christ in you, the hope of glory; this is to be connected with
all that goes before: Christ is the riches of the Gospel; the riches of
the divine perfections, which the Gospel more clearly displays than the
works of creation or providence, are all in Christ, the fulness of them
dwells in him; and this is the grace the Gospel reveals, that he, who
was rich with all these, became poor to make us rich; the rich promises
of the Gospel were all made to Christ, and are all yea and "Amen" in
him; the rich blessings of it are all in his hands, righteousness,
peace, and pardon, the riches both of grace and glory; the rich
treasures of its divine truths are hid in him; and he is the substance
of everyone of them: Christ is also the glory of the Gospel, inasmuch as
he is the author, preacher, and subject of it; it is full of the glory
of his person, both as the only begotten of the Father, and as the only
Mediator between God and man; it is the glass through which this is
seen: moreover, the glory of God in him is expressed hereby; the glory
of his wisdom and power, of his truth and faithfulness, of his justice
and holiness, of his love, grace, and mercy, and every other perfection,
is eminently held forth in the Gospel; as this is great in the salvation
and redemption of his people by Christ, which the Gospel brings the good
news of; add to this, that that glory which the saints shall have with
Christ, and will lie in the enjoyment of him to all eternity, is brought
to light in the Gospel: Christ is also the mystery of the Gospel; he is
one of the persons in the mystery of the Trinity; the mystery of his
divine sonship, of his divine person, being God and yet man, man and yet
God, and both in one person, and of his incarnation and redemption,
makes a considerable part of the Gospel: and Christ, who is the sum and
substance of it, is "in" his people; not only as the omnipresent God, as
the author of the light of nature, as the Creator of all things, in whom
all live, move, and have their beings, but in a way of special grace;
and the phrase is expressive of a revelation of him in them, of their
possession of him, of his inhabitation in them by his Spirit and grace,
particularly by faith, and of their communion with him, in consequence
of their union to him; and being so, he is the ground and foundation of
their hopes of glory. There is a glory which the saints are hoping for,
which the glories of this world are but a faint resemblance of; which is
unseen at present, and which the sufferings of the present time are not
worthy to be compared unto; what is eternal, and which Christ has
entered into, and took possession of; and what will greatly consist in
beholding his glory, and in everlasting communion with him; this through
grace saints have a good hope of, and are waiting for, and even rejoice
at times in the hope of it; of which hope Christ is the foundation; for
not only the promise of it is with him, but the glory itself is in his
hands; the gift of it is with him, and through him; he has made way by
his sufferings and death for the enjoyment of it, and is now preparing
it for them, by his presence and intercession; his grace makes them meet
for it, his righteousness gives them a title to it, and his Spirit is
the earnest of it, and the substance of it will be the fruition of

Whom we preach,.... Under the above considerations; as the riches, the
glory, and the mystery of the Gospel; as the hope set before lost
sinners to lay hold upon; as the only Saviour and Redeemer, by whose
righteousness believers are justified, through whose blood their sins
are pardoned, by whose sacrifice and satisfaction atonement is made, and
in whose person alone is acceptance with God: Christ and him crucified,
and salvation by him, were the subjects of the ministry of the apostles;
on this they dwelt, and it was this which was blessed for the conversion
of sinners, the edification of saints, the planting of churches, and the
setting up and establishing the kingdom and interest of Christ:

warning every man; of his lost state and condition by nature; of the
wrath to come, and the danger he is in of it; of the terrors of the
Lord, and of an awful judgment; showing sinners that they are
unrighteous and unholy, that their nature is corrupt and impure, their
best righteousness imperfect, and cannot justify them before God; that
they stand guilty before him, and that destruction and misery are in all
their ways; and therefore advise them to flee from the wrath to come, to
the hope set before them in the Gospel:

and teaching every man in all wisdom; not natural, but spiritual and
evangelical; the whole Gospel of Christ, the counsel of God, the wisdom
of God in a mystery, and all the branches of it; teaching them to
believe in Christ for salvation, to lay hold on his righteousness for
justification, to deal with his blood for pardon, and with his sacrifice
for the atonement of their sins; and to observe all things commanded by
Christ, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly: by these two words,
"warning" and "teaching", the several parts of the Gospel ministry are
expressed; and which extend to all sorts of men, rich and poor, bond and
free, greater and lesser sinners, Gentiles as well as Jews; and who are
chiefly designed here, and elsewhere, by every man and every creature:

that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus; not in
themselves, in which sense no man is perfect in this life; but in the
grace, holiness, and righteousness of Christ, in whom all the saints are
complete: or it may regard that ripeness of understanding, and
perfection of knowledge, which, when arrived unto, saints become perfect
men in Christ; and is the end of the Gospel ministry, and to which men
are brought by it; see [Eph 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013.md); and
to be understood of the presentation of the saints, not by Christ to
himself, and to his Father, but by the ministers of the Gospel, as their
glory and crown of rejoicing in the day of Christ.

Whereunto I also labour,.... In the word and doctrine, by preaching
Christ, warning sinners of their danger, teaching them the way of
salvation, and their duty; with this view, that, in thee great day of
account, he might bring a large number of them, and set them before
Christ as the seals of his ministry, as instances of the grace of
Christ, and as perfect in him:

striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily; meaning
either in his prayers, earnestly entreating of God that he would succeed
his labours, and bless them to the conversion of many; which sense is
favoured by the Syriac version, which renders it, "and make
supplication"; that is, with that effectual fervent prayer, which was
powerfully wrought in him: or in his ministry, combating with many
enemies, fighting the good fight of faith; not in his own strength, but
through the power of Christ; which enabled him to preach the Gospel far
and near, in season and out of season; which supported his outward man,
and strengthened his inward man for that service, and made it effectual
to the good of the souls of many: some refer this to the signs, wonders,
and miracles, which Christ wrought by him, for the confirmation of the
Gospel; but the other sense, which takes in both the power by which he
was assisted in preaching, both in body and soul, and that which went
along with his ministry to make it useful to others, is to be preferred.
