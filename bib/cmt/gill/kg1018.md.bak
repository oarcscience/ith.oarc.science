INTRODUCTION TO 1 KINGS 18

In this chapter Elijah has an order from the Lord to show himself to
Ahab, who, going first, and meeting with a servant of his, Obadiah,
charges him to tell his master where he was, that he might meet him,
[Kg1 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#001.md), and, upon meeting him,
desires that all Israel, and the prophets of Baal, might be convened,
which was accordingly done, [Kg1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#017.md), when he expostulated with the
people of Israel for their idolatry, mocked and confounded the prophets
of Baal, and gave the strongest proofs, to the conviction of the people,
that Jehovah is the true God, [Kg1
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md), on which all the prophets of
Baal were slain, [Kg1 18:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#040.md), and rain
in great abundance was given at the prayer of the prophet, [Kg1
18:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#041.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 18:1</span></span>

And it came to pass after many days,.... When two years and more were
gone from the time the drought and famine began; or rather from the time
of the prophets departure to the brook Cherith, which might be six
months after the famine began:

that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year; of his
absence from Ahab:

saying, go show thyself unto Ahab; whom he had not seen so long, and who
had been seeking for him, but to no purpose:

and I will send rain upon the earth; the term of three years and six
months being almost expired, see [Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 18:2</span></span>

And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab,.... Which showed his cheerful
and ready obedience to the will of God, and his great courage and
magnanimity, to face a king enraged against him, and that sought his
life:

and there was a sore famine in Samaria; the metropolis of the kingdom,
where Ahab kept his court, and therefore must be sensible of it, and
bore the greater indignation against the prophet who had foretold it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 18:3</span></span>

And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house,....
Perhaps his steward: the Jews (m) take him to be Obadiah the prophet,
who wrote the small prophecy that goes by his name:

(now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly:) who, though he did not go up to
Jerusalem to worship, which ceremonial service was dispensed with in
him, yet he did not worship the calves, nor Baal, but served the Lord in
a spiritual manner.

\(m\) T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 39. 2.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 18:4</span></span>

For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord,.... Or
slew them, as the Targum; put them to death some way or another; such as
were brought up in the schools of the prophets, trained up in religious
exercises, and instructed others therein:

that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave;
fifty in one cave and fifty in another; for there were large caves in
the land of Israel capable of holding such a number, and many more, see
[Sa1 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md) and fed them with bread and
water; which in this time of famine were very acceptable; though these
may be put for all the necessaries of life.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 18:5</span></span>

And Ahab said unto Obadiah, go into the land, unto all fountains of
water, and unto all brooks,.... To observe in what condition they were,
and the places adjoining to them, the meadows and valleys:

peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive;
particularly those which belonged to the king's stables, to find
provisions for which it was found difficult:

that we lose not all the beasts; many of them, doubtless, were lost
through the drought already, and there was great danger of the rest, and
so, in time, of there being none to procreate and preserve their
species, and to prevent which Ahab proposed to take this method.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 18:6</span></span>

So they divided the land between them, to pass through it,.... And one
took one part, and the other the other part:

Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself;
Ahab not caring to trust any but Obadiah, who he knew was a faithful
man, lest they should be bribed by those that had grass not to discover
it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 18:7</span></span>

And as Obadiah was in the way,.... In his district, making his
observations:

behold, Elijah met him: where is not said; but he was, no doubt, upon
the road from Zarephath to Samaria:

and he knew him that is, Obadiah knew Elijah, having seen him at Ahab's
court before he absconded:

and fell on his face, and said, art thou that my lord Elijah? thus doing
him honour and reverence both by words and gesture, as being an
extraordinary prophet of the Lord.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 18:8</span></span>

And he answered him, I am,.... He did not desire to be concealed, his
orders were to show and make himself known to Ahab, and Obadiah was one
of his domestic servants:

go tell thy lord, behold, Elijah is here; in such a place, ready to face
him at any time. Elijah, by calling Ahab the lord of Obadiah, as he
tacitly reproves him for calling him lord, shows reverence to Ahab as a
king, and yet that he was fearless of him, as he was the prophet and
ambassador of the Lord of hosts to him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 18:9</span></span>

And he said, what have I sinned,.... Or in what have I offended God or
his prophet, that revenge should be taken on me in this way:

that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab to slay me?
for that he supposed would be the consequence of it, as he argues and
more plainly expresses his sense in the following words.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 18:10</span></span>

As the Lord thy God liveth,.... Which is the form of an oath he thought
fit to make, to ascertain the truth of what he was about to say:

there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek
thee; which is either an hyperbolical expression, signifying he had
sought for him in many places, and in every place he could think of; or
it must be understood either of the ten tribes, which were as so many
nations and kingdoms as they had been; or were more in the times of the
Canaanites; or of the nations round about, that were in alliance with or
tributary to the king of Israel:

and when they said, he is not there, he took an oath of the kingdom and
nation that they found thee not; which he might exact of his own
subjects, but could not of other nations, unless they were free to it of
themselves; or he might take it of their ambassadors or merchants that
came into his land, of whom he inquired, and adjured them to tell him
the truth.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 18:11</span></span>

And now thou sayest, go tell thy lord, behold, Elijah is here. Which, if
I should not be able to make good, would be of fatal consequence to me;
and that it is plain he feared, by what he next says.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 18:12</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the
Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not,.... This he
supposed might possibly, and very probably, be the case, since small
raptures might have been already, and known to Obadiah, as there were
afterwards, see [Kg2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#016.md), and then he
should not know where he was, nor be able to direct his master where to
find him:

and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay
me; for telling him a lie, and deceiving and mocking him; or for not
seizing on Elijah, and bringing him, when he knew he was so desirous of
getting him into his hands:

but I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth; and therefore did not
deserve to be treated after this manner, having been an early and
conscientious worshipper of the true God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 18:13</span></span>

Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the
Lord? how I hid one hundred men of the Lord's prophets by fifty in a
cave, and fed them with bread and water? See Gill on [Kg1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004.md), this he said not in a way of
ostentation, but to show that it would be very ungenerous and
ungrateful, as well as impolitic, to sacrifice such a friend at court to
the Lord's prophets as he had been, and might still continue to be.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 18:14</span></span>

And now thou sayest, go tell my lord, behold, Elijah is here: and he
shall slay me. That is, should he carry such a message to him, and
Elijah should be removed elsewhere, and not to be found.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 18:15</span></span>

And Elijah said, as the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand,....
In whose presence he was, and whose prophet and minister he was; he
takes this oath, to assure Obadiah that he would certainly be upon the
spot, or to be found, and not expose him to any danger:

I will surely show myself unto him today; he was determined at all
events to present himself to him that day.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 18:16</span></span>

So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him,.... That Elijah was in such
a place, and had desired him to inform him of it, and was ready to
appear before him that day wherever he pleased; for upon the prophet's
oath Obadiah was entirely satisfied, and was in no fear of delivering
the message:

and Ahab went to meet Elijah; though perhaps the bold message of the
prophet might make him fear he had something to say to him not very
agreeable.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 18:17</span></span>

And it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah,.... As soon as he came up to
him, and knew who he was; Abarbinel thinks, because his hair was grown
so long that Ahab did not know him certainly, and therefore put the
following question:

that Ahab said unto him, art thou he that troubleth Israel? by opposing
the religion of Baal, which prevailed among them; but chiefly rain being
withheld from them according to his word, and at his prayer.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 18:18</span></span>

And he answered,.... That is, Elijah, with great boldness and undaunted
courage, not fearing the face of the king, being sent to show himself to
him in the name of the King of kings:

I have not troubled Israel, but thou and thy father's house; they, by
their sins, were the cause of all the troubles, those sore evil and sad
calamities that were upon them:

in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord: to have no other
gods before him, and not to make images, and worship them, which they
had done:

and thou hast followed Baalim; the several Baals, the Sun, moon, and
stars, the whole host of heaven, worshipped under this name; or, not
content with the Phoenician Baal, or Baal of the Zidonians, followed
others, see [Jdg 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 18:19</span></span>

Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel.....
No doubt but more discourse passed between Ahab and Elijah, though not
recorded, before he made this motion to him; it is very probable, that
after some dispute between them, who was the true God, and about
idolatry, as the cause of want of rain, Elijah proposed to the king what
he afterwards did to the people, to which he could not object; and being
desirous of gratifying his curiosity, and especially of having rain,
which the prophet might promise him in the issue of this affair, he
agreed unto it; and therefore Elijah desired that all Israel might be
convened, that it might be openly and publicly done, and to the
conviction and reformation of them, which was what was chiefly designed;
and he chose Carmel, a mountain in the tribe of Issachar, well situated
for the people that came from all parts; and the rather this than
Samaria, that he might meet with no obstruction from Jezebel, and from
whence: he might be able to see the rain when coming, as he did. Of this
mountain; see Gill on [Jer 46:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#018.md), to
which may be added, the description of it by Mr. Sandys (n).

"Mount Carmel stretcheth from east to west, and hath its uttermost basis
washed with the sea; steepest towards the north, and of an indifferent
altitude; rich in vines and olives when farmed, and abounding with
several sorts of fruits and herbs, both medicinal and fragrant, though
now much overgrown with woods and shrubs of sweet savour.''

From the following solemn transaction at it, it seems in later times, to
have become sacred, and was very venerable with the Heathens; from this
mountain, a deity with them had the name of Carmel, and was worshipped
here, without an image or a temple, only had an altar erected for it, in
imitation of the God of Israel, worshipped here in like manner; here
Vespasian sacrificed to this deity, assisted by the priest of it,
Basilides, as Tacitus (o) relates; Suetonius (p) also makes mention of
this deity, and of Vespasian's consulting its oracle, which gave him
hopes of obtaining the empire; and from hence, in Popish times, there
were an order of friars called Carmelites, instituted in the year 1180,
pretending to be the successors of the children of the prophets Elijah
left there:

and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty; who are supposed to be
dispersed in the various parts of the kingdom, to teach and practise the
worship of Baal, and encourage and spread it in the nation:

and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's
table; for it seems there were now more groves than that one Ahab first
made, [Kg1 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#033.md), for which such
numbers were appointed to attend, and which, perhaps, were near Samaria,
since they ate at Jezebel's table, and were a sort of domestic chaplains
of her's. "Asheroth", we render "groves", the learned Selden (q) takes
to be Ashtoreth, or Ashtareth, or Astarte, the goddess of the Zidonians,
for whom, and so for these prophets, Jezebel might have a peculiar
respect, see [Kg1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 18:20</span></span>

So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel,.... By messengers,
requiring their attendance at Mount Carmel at such a time, at least
their chief and principal men:

and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel; the four hundred
and fifty prophets of Baal, but not the four hundred prophets of the
groves; for of them we have no account afterwards, only of the former;
it may be they were not at the command of Ahab, only of Jezebel, at
whose table they ate, who would not suffer them to go.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 18:21</span></span>

And Elijah came unto all the people,.... Assembled at Mount Carmel:

and said, how long halt ye between two opinions? sometimes inclining to
the one, and sometimes to the other: as a lame man in walking, his body
moves sometimes to one side, and sometimes to another; or "leap ye upon
two branches" (r), like a bird that leaps or hops from one branch to
another, and never settles long; or rather it denotes the confusion of
their thoughts, being like branches of trees twisted and implicated;
thus upbraiding them with their inconstancy and fickleness; what their
two opinions were, may be learnt from the next clause:

if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him; for there
is but one God, one infinite, immense, and incomprehensible being; one
that is omnipotent, all sufficient, good, and perfect; there cannot be
more, and therefore but one to be followed, served, and worshipped:

and the people answered him not a word: through conviction and
confusion, his reasoning being unanswerable; or not knowing which to
choose at present; or fearing they should be drawn into a snare, should
they name any; either incur the displeasure of the king, who was for
Baal, or of the prophet, who was for the Lord, at whose word rain was
withheld, and might be given, which they were desirous of.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 18:22</span></span>

Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only remain a prophet of the
Lord,.... At least as he thought, all the rest being slain, as he
supposed; however there were none present but himself:

but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men; which were very
great odds he had to contend with.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 18:23</span></span>

Let them therefore give us two bullocks,.... Who, being so many, were
better able to be at the expense of them, and having the king on their
party too; though perhaps no more is meant than that two bullocks should
be brought thither, and presented before them:

and let them choose one bullock for themselves; which of the two they
would, if they thought one was any ways preferable to the other, it was
at their option to take it:

and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood; as sacrifices usually were:

and put no fire under; which was wont to be done for burnt offerings, as
this was designed to be:

and I will dress the other bullock; by slaying and cutting it in pieces;

and lay it on wood: as for a burnt offering:

and put no fire under; to consume it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 18:24</span></span>

And call ye on the name of your gods,.... The Baalim, the many lords and
gods they served:

and I will call on the name of the Lord; the one true Jehovah and God of
Israel, whom I serve:

and the God that answereth by fire; by causing fire to come down upon
the sacrifice, and consume it:

let him be God; accounted, owned, and acknowledged as the true God, and
so afterwards worshipped as such:

and all the people answered and said, it is well spoken; they thought it
a very reasonable proposal, a very good method to determine the
controversy, and come at the truth, and know who was the true God, and
who not.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 18:25</span></span>

And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal,.... Who agreed to this
proposal, though not expressed; or they signified it by their silence.
Ben Gersom thinks they agreed to it, because that, according to their
belief, Baal was Mars, and in the sign of Aries, one of the fiery
planets, and therefore fancied he could send down fire on their
sacrifice; but Abarbinel is of opinion that it was the sun they
worshipped, under the name of Baal, the great luminary which presides
over the element of fire, and therefore had power to cause it to
descend; and if not, they agreed to it, he thinks, for three reasons;
one was necessity, they could not refuse, after the people had approved
of it, lest they should rise upon them, and stone them; and another was,
that Elijah proposed to offer without the temple, contrary to the law of
his God, and therefore concluded he would not answer him by fire, and so
they should be upon a par with him; and the third was, that they thought
they should offer their bullocks together, so that, if fire descended,
it would come upon them both, and then the dispute would be, whether his
God, or their god, sent it; and so no proof could be made who was God,
nor the matter in controversy decided:

choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are
many; therefore in civility to them gave the choice of the bullock and
the altar first, he being one and they many:

and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under; under the wood
on which was the sacrifice cut in pieces; and when they had so done,
then they were to call on their gods to cause fire to descend upon it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 18:26</span></span>

And they took the bullock which was given them,.... By such of them as
made the choice:

and they dressed it; slew it, and cut it in pieces, and laid it on the
wood, but put no fire under it:

and called on the name of Baal, from morning even until noon, saying, O
Baal, hear us; and send fire down on the sacrifice; and if the sun was
their Baal, they might hope, as the heat he gradually diffused was at
its height at noon, that some flashes of fire would proceed from it to
consume their sacrifice; but after, their hope was turned into despair,
they became and acted like madmen:

but there was no voice, nor any that answered; by word, or by sending
down fire as they desired:

and they leapt upon the altar which was made; not by Elijah, but by
themselves, either now or heretofore, and where they had formerly
sacrificed; and they danced about it, and leaped on it, either according
to a custom used by them; such as the Salii, the priests of Mars, used,
so called from their leaping, because they did their sacred things
leaping, and went about their altars capering and leaping (s); or rather
they were mad on it, as the Targum renders it, and acted like madmen, as
if they were agitated by a prophetic fury and frenzy.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 18:27</span></span>

And it came to pass at noon,.... When they had been from the time of the
morning sacrifice until now invoking their deity to no purpose:

that Elijah mocked them; he jeered and bantered them:

and said, cry aloud; your god does not hear you; perhaps, if you raise
your voice higher, he may;

for he is a god; according to your esteem of him, and, if so, he surely
may hear you: unless

either he is talking; with others about matters of moment and
importance, who are waiting on him with their applications to him; or he
is in meditation; in a deep study upon some things difficult to be
resolved:

or he is pursuing; his studies, or his pleasures, or his enemies, to
overtake them; or he is employed on business (t):

or he is in a journey; gone to visit his friends, or some parts of his
dominions; so Homer (u) represents Jupiter gone to pay a visit to the
Ethiopians, and as yesterday gone to a feast, and all the gods following
him, from whence he would not return until twelve days; and in like
manner Lucian (w) speaks of the gods, mocking at them:

or, peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked; with a loud crying to
him: it being now noon, Abarbinel thinks this refers to a custom of
sleeping after dinner; Homer (x) also speaks of the sleep of the gods,
and which used to be at noon; and therefore the worshippers of Baal
ceased then to call upon him; and it is said (y), the Heathens feared to
go into the temples of their gods at noon, lest they should disturb
them; but such is not the true God, the God of Israel, he neither
slumbers nor sleeps, [Psa 121:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004.md).

And they cried aloud,.... Trying to make him hear, if possible:

and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the
blood gushed out upon them; so the priests of Heathen deities used to
slash themselves on their shoulders, arms, and thighs, in their
devotions to them, as many writers observe (z), fancying their gods were
delighted with human blood; particularly the priests of Bellona (a), and
the worshippers of the Syrian goddess (b), and of the Egyptian Isis (c).

And it came to pass when midday was past,.... And nothing done, no fire
descended:

and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening
sacrifice; continued praying to Baal, and singing his praises, but all
to no purpose; or they behaved like madmen, as the Targum; thus they
went on until it was time to offer the evening sacrifice; so that they
had no interruption in their service, and had all the time they could
desire to have to importune their god to do the favour for them they
requested:

that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded;
no voice was heard that returned them any answer; nor was any answer
made by fire, nor any regard shown to their mad gestures, and barbarous
actions; and very likely the people also, by this time, paid no regard
unto them, perceiving they were not able, by all their cries and methods
they took, to obtain an answer.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 18:30</span></span>

And Elijah said unto all the people, come near unto me,.... And observe
what I do, and what will be done at my request:

and all the people came near unto him; left the prophets of Baal to
themselves, and took no more notice of them, but attended to what the
prophet should say and do:

and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down; which had
been set up when high places and altars were allowed of, while the
tabernacle was unsettled, and the temple not built; this is supposed to
have been erected in the times of the judges; though, according to a
tradition of the Jews (d), it was built by Saul, see [Sa1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#012.md) but had been thrown down by the
idolatrous Israelites, who demolished such as were erected to the name
of the Lord everywhere, and built new ones for their idols, [Kg1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010). Benjamin of Tudela (e.md) says,
that on the top of Mount Carmel is now to be seen the place of the altar
Elijah repaired, which is four cubits round.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 18:31</span></span>

And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of
the sons of Jacob,.... Which he might very easily come at from the
mountain:

unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name,
which signifies one that has power with God, as Jacob had, when the word
came to him to make a change in his name at Penuel, [Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028.md), and as Elijah hoped and
believed he should have at this time, being a prophet, and a worshipper
of Israel's God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 18:32</span></span>

And with the stones he built an altar in the same of the Lord,.... Whom
the twelve tribes had formerly worshipped; and though now divided in
their civil state, yet ought to be united in the worship of God:

and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two
measures of seed; or two seahs, one of which was the third part of an
ephah, and two of them were more than half a bushel; and this trench or
ditch round the altar was as broad as such a measure of seed would sow.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 18:33</span></span>

And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid
him on the wood,.... Just in such manner as sacrifices usually were:

and said, fill four barrels with water; either from the brook Kishon,
or, if that was dried up, from the sea; for both were near this
mountain, and so to be had, though a time of drought:

and pour it on the burnt sacrifice; that which was intended to be one:

and upon the wood: wherewith it was to be burnt, and so made unfit for
it; and which would make the miracle appear the greater, when fire came
down and consumed it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 18:34</span></span>

And he said, do it the second time, and they did it the second time,....
That is, poured four barrels of water more upon the wood:

and he said, do it the third time, and they did it the third time; so
that there were in all twelve barrels of water poured on the wood,
agreeably to the number of the twelve stones the altar was built with,
and may have respect to the same as they.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 18:35</span></span>

And the water ran round about the altar,.... There being such a large
effusion of it on it;

and he filled the trench also with water; which surrounded the altar, so
that it seemed impracticable that any fire should kindle upon it; and
this gave full proof and demonstration there could be no collusion in
this matter.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 18:36</span></span>

And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening
sacrifice,.... Which the people of God at Jerusalem were now attending
to:

that Elijah the prophet came near; to the altar he had built, and on
which he had laid the sacrifice:

and said; in prayer to God:

Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; the covenant God of the ancestors
of his people, though they had now so fully departed from him:

let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel; and that there is
no other:

and that I am thy servant; a true worshipper of him, and his faithful
prophet and minister:

and that I have done all these things at thy word; restrained rain from
the earth for some years past, and now had convened Israel, and the
false prophets, together, that by a visible sign from heaven it might be
known who was the true God; all which he did not of himself, but by the
impulse, direction, and, commandment of the Lord.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg1 18:37</span></span>

Hear me, O Lord, hear me;.... Which repetition is made to express his
importunity, and the vehement earnest desire of his soul to be heard in
such a case, which so much concerned the glory of God; the Targum is,

"receive my prayer, O Lord, concerning the fire, receive my prayer
concerning the rain;''

as if the one respected the sending down the fire on the sacrifice, and
the other sending rain on the earth; and which sense is followed by
other Jewish writers:

that this people may know that thou art the Lord God; and not Baal, or
any other idol:

and that thou hast turned their heart back again; from idolatry, to the
worship of the true God; though some understand this of God's giving
them up to a spirit of error, and suffering them to fall into idolatry,
and hardening their hearts, as he did Pharaoh's; but the former sense is
best.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 18:38</span></span>

Then the fire of the Lord fell,.... An extraordinary fire from God out
of heaven, as the effects of it show:

and consumed the burnt sacrifice; as it had done in former instances,
[Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md), and besides this, which is
still more extraordinary,

and the wood, and the stones, and the dust; of the altar, thereby
signifying that even such were not to be used any more:

and licked up the water that was in the trench; around the altar, see
[Kg1 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#032.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 18:39</span></span>

And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces,.... In
reverence of God, astonished at the miracle wrought, ashamed of
themselves and their sins, particularly their idolatry, that they should
turn their backs on the true God, and follow idols:

and they said, the Lord, he is the God, the Lord, he is the God; which
acknowledgment of God, as the true God, in opposition to Baal, is
repeated, to show their firm belief and strong assurance of it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg1 18:40</span></span>

And Elijah said unto them, take the prophets of Baal,.... The four
hundred and fifty that were upon the spot; for the number of the people
of Israel, now gathered together, were equal to it; nor was it in Ahab's
power to hinder it, and he might himself be so far surprised and
convicted as not in the least to object to it:

let not one of them escape: that there might be none of them left to
seduce the people any more:

and they took them; laid hold on them, everyone of them:

and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon; which ran by the side,
and at the bottom of Mount Carmel, into the sea; See Gill on [Jdg
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#007.md), [Jdg
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021.md).

and slew them there; intimating, that it was owing to the idolatry they
led the people into that rain had been withheld, and the brooks were
dried up, as this might be; or, as Ben Gersom thinks, that the land
might not be defiled with their blood, but be carried down the river
after it: these he slew not with his own hand, but by others he gave
orders to do it; and this not as a private person, but as an
extraordinary minister of God, to execute justice according to his law,
[Deu 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md) by which law such false
prophets were to die; and the rather he was raised up and spirited for
this service, as the supreme magistrate was addicted to idolatry
himself.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 18:41</span></span>

And Elijah said unto Ahab, get thee up,.... From the brook and valley
where the execution of the prophets had been made; either up to his
chariot, or to the tent or pavilion erected on the side of the mount,
where the whole scene of things was transacted;

eat and drink; which he had no leisure for all the day, from the time of
the morning sacrifice to the evening sacrifice, which was taken up in
attending to the issue of the several sacrifices; but now he is bid to
eat and refresh himself, and that in token of joy and gladness, as
became him, both for the honour of the true God, which had been
abundantly confirmed, and for the near approach of rain, of which he
assures him:

for there is a sound of abundance of rain; the wind perhaps began to
rise, and blow pretty briskly, which was a sign of it (f); besides,
according to the Tyrian annals (g), there were loud claps of thunder at
this time, at least when the heavens became very black, as in [Kg1
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#045.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">kg1 18:42</span></span>

So Ahab went up to eat and to drink,.... Up to his chariot, as some
think, or rather to some place higher than that in which he now was:

and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; higher still, where he both
might be alone, and have the opportunity of observing the clouds
gathering, and the rain coming:

and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his
knees; expressive of his humility, and of his earnestness, and vehement
desire, and continued importunity, that rain might fall; for this was a
posture of prayer he put himself into, and continued in; and it is
certain that it was through his prayer that rain came, [Jam
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#018.md) and from hence came the fable of
the Grecians concerning Aeacus praying for rain in a time of drought,
when it came (h). So the Chinese writers (i) report that at the prayers
of their emperor Tangus, after a seven years' drought, great rains fell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg1 18:43</span></span>

And said to his servant,.... Whom some take to be the son of the widow
of Sarepta, but he must be too young to be employed in such service as
this was:

go up now; still higher on Mount Carmel; than where he was, even to the
highest point of it:

look towards the sea: or the west, as the Targum, the Mediterranean sea,
which lay to the west of the land of Israel:

and he went up and looked, and he said, there is nothing; there was
nothing in the sky, or arising out of the sea, that looked like or
foreboded rain:

and he said, go again seven times; till he should see something.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">kg1 18:44</span></span>

And it came to pass at the seventh time that he said, behold there
ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand,.... Either
about the size or in the form of it; rain water comes out of the sea,
and, being strained through the clouds and air, becomes fresh:

and he said, go up: the meaning seems to be, that he should first go
down from the mount, and then go up to that part of it where Ahab was:

say unto Ahab, prepare thy chariot; bind or fasten the horses to it, as
the phrase seems to signify:

and get thee down; from the mountain where he was, to go to Jezreel,
which lay low in a valley:

that the rain stop thee not; on the road, that might be made impassable
by it, signifying that such abundance should fall as would make it so.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 18:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">kg1 18:45</span></span>

And it came to pass in the mean while,.... That the servant was gone
with the message to Ahab, and Ahab was getting ready his chariot:

that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great
rain; which all sprung from the cloud like a man's hand; and so we are
told (k), that sometimes a little cloud called the ox's eye is seen on a
mount of the Cape of Good Hope, called Tafesbery, when the sky is most
serene, and the sea quiet; which is at first scarce so big as a barley
corn, and then as a walnut; and presently it extends itself over the
whole surface of the mountain:

and Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel; as fast as he could.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">kg1 18:46</span></span>

And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah,.... Giving him more than common
strength of body, as well as courage and fortitude of mind; so the
Targum, the spirit of strength from the Lord was with him:

and he girded up his loins; gathered up his long loose garment, and girt
it about him, that he might be more fit for travelling:

and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel; reckoned about sixteen
miles from Carmel (l); this showed his humility, that he was not elated
with the wonderful things God had done by him, and that he bore no ill
will to Ahab, but was ready to show him all honour and respect due to
him as a king; and that it were his sins, and not his person, he had an
aversion to; and that he was not afraid of Jezebel, and her prophets,
but entered into the city where she was, to instruct the people, and
warn them against her idolatries; though some think he went no further
than the gate of the city, prudently avoiding falling into her hands.
