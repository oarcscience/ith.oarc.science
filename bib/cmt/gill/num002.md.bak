INTRODUCTION TO NUMBERS 2

This chapter contains the order of the encampment and march of the
tribes of Israel in their proper places about the tabernacle; the
general direction for the same is in [Num
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md); the particulars follow; on the
cast of the tabernacle the camp of Judah was to pitch, and under his
standard the tribes of Issachar and Zebulun, [Num
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003.md); on the south side of it the camp
of Reuben, and under his standard the tribes of Simeon and Gad, [Num
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#010.md); then the tabernacle, with the
camp of the Levites round it, were next, to stand or set forward, [Num
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#017.md); and on the west side the camp of
Ephraim, and under his standard the tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin,
[Num 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#018.md); and on the north side the
camp of Dan, and under his standard the tribes of Asher and Naphtali,
[Num 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#025.md); the sum total of the
numbers of which camps are given, exclusive of the camp of Levi, [Num
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#032.md); and the chapter is concluded
with observing, that all was done according to the commandment of God,
[Num 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#034.md).

[Numbers 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 2:1</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses, and unto Aaron,.... Very probably after
the number of the children of Israel was taken, of which in the
preceding chapter, and when the congregation of Israel with the
tabernacle were about to set forward on their journey; and therefore
directions are here given for their orderly and regular proceeding in
it, in what form and manner they should both encamp and march:

saying: as follows.

[Numbers 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 2:2</span></span>

Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard,....
Or banner, of which there were four, as appears from the following
account, under each of which were placed three tribes; and so every man
of each tribe was to pitch his tent in the tribe he belonged to, and by
the standard under which his tribe was marshalled, and in the rank that
he was placed:

with the ensigns of their father's house; which were either lesser
standards or banners, somewhat different from the great standard or
banner, which belonged to the camp consisting of three tribes, and which
were peculiar to their several families and houses, and distinguished
one from another, like flags in different regiments; or these were signs
(f), as the word may be rendered, or marks in the standards or banners,
which, distinguished one from another; so the Targum of Jonathan, the
signs which were marked in their standards: but what they were is not
easy to say; Aben Ezra observes, and Abendana from him, that their
ancients were used to say, that there was in the standard of Reuben the
form of a man, on account of the mandrakes, [Gen
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#014.md); and in the standard of Judah
the form of a lion, because Jacob compared him to one, [Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md); and in the standard of Ephraim
the form of an ox, from the sense of those words, the firstling of his
bullock, [Deu 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017.md); and in the
standard of Dan the form of an eagle, so that they might be like the
cherubim the prophet Ezekiel saw, [Eze
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md), which is not very likely, such
images and representations not being very agreeable, yea, even
detestable to the people of the Jews in later times, and can hardly be
thought to be in use with their early ancestors: others, as Jarchi,
fancy that those standards were distinguished by their colours, as our
flags or ensigns are; which, if they stopped here, would not be much
amiss, but they go on and say, that each was according to the colour of
his stone fixed in the breastplate, so that there were three colours in
every flag or standard; thus, for instance, in the standard of Judah,
which is the first, were the colours of the three precious stones, on
which were the names of Judah, Issachar, and Reuben, namely, the
emerald, sapphire, and diamond; and so in the rest of the standards; but
others say, the letters of the names of the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, differently disposed of, were on those standards; but rather,
one would think, the names of the three tribes under every standard were
embroidered on them, which would sufficiently distinguish one from
another, and direct where tribe was to pitch; but of those things there
is no certainty:

far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch: a
mile from it, according to Jarchi, or two thousand cubits, which is
supposed to be a sabbath day's journey, [Act
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012.md); and this distance is gathered
from [Jos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#004.md), and is not improbable.

[Numbers 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 2:3</span></span>

And on the east side, towards the rising of the sun,.... Which rises in
the east; or of all; for, as Jarchi observes, that which is "before" is
called "Kedem", the east, as the west is called "behind":

shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch, throughout their
armies; the tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, formed one camp,
which had its name from the principal tribe Judah; and this was divided
into various regiments and companies, called armies, who severally
pitched under one and the same standard. It is said (g) Judah's stone
was the "nophech" (which we render an emerald), and his flag was
coloured in the likeness of the colour of the heavens, and there was
formed upon it a lion. Issachar's was the sapphire, and his flag was
coloured black, like to black lead, and there were framed upon it the
sun and moon, on account of what is said, [Ch1
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#032.md). Zebulun's was a diamond, and
his flag was coloured white, and there was formed upon it a ship,
because of what is said, [Gen 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013.md),

and Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, shall be captain of the children of
Judah; who had been assisting in numbering the people, and who
afterwards offered to the dedication of the altar, [Num
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#002.md).

\(g\) Bemidbar Rabba, sect. 2. fol. 178. 2.

[Numbers 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 2:4</span></span>

And his host, and those that were numbered of them,.... As they had been
before; and, supposing these words to be the words of God, there is no
necessity of rendering them in the future, as some have observed; though
they seem rather to be the words of Moses, who under every tribe repeats
the number, which is exactly the same as when taken; and though it was
not till twenty days after that they set forward according to their
order of encampment, not one of them died, which Aben Ezra observes as a
very wonderful thing:

were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred; the number of the
tribe of Judah were 74,600; see [Num
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#027.md).

[Numbers 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 2:5</span></span>

And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of
Issachar,.... Who with Zebulun, after mentioned, as placed with him
under the same standard, were the brethren of Judah, by the same mother
Leah, and so fitly put together, as most likely to continue in harmony
and love; and being the youngest sons of Leah, and brethren of Judah,
would, without any reluctance or murmuring, pitch under their elder
brother's standard:

and Nethaneel, the son of Zuar, shall be captain of the children of
Issachar; see [Num 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#008.md).

[Numbers 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 2:6</span></span>

And his host,.... The host of Issachar:

and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and
four hundred. 54,400 men. Which had been numbered, for it does not
appear that there was a fresh account taken; see [Num
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#029.md).

[Numbers 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 2:7</span></span>

Then the tribe of Zebulun,.... He pitched next; though the order of
their encampment was not, as it may seem, first Judah, after him
Issachar, and below him Zebulun; for Judah lay between these two, the
one before him, and the other behind him; and it was Issachar that was
behind, and Zebulun before, as Aben Ezra observes; they were pitched on
each side of the standard of Judah, one on one side, and the other on
the other side:

and Eliab, the son of Helon, shall be, captain of the children of
Zebulun; see [Num 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#009.md); each tribe had
its own captain; nor does it appear that there was a general over those
captains, that had the command of the camp, consisting of three tribes,
but Moses was the generalissimo of all the camps.

[Numbers 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 2:8</span></span>

And his host,.... That is, the host of Zebulun:

and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and seven thousand and
four hundred. 57,400 men; see [Num
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#031.md).

[Numbers 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 2:9</span></span>

All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred thousand and
fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred,

throughout their armies,.... 186,400 men. The sum total of the three
tribes, which formed that camp: this was the largest camp of them all,
being near 30,000 more than Dan's, [Num
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#031.md), which was the next in number
unto it, and therefore placed foremost, and as the vanguard to the
tabernacle:

these shall first set forth; in a march, when about to journey; when
they saw the cloud remove, the priests blew with the trumpets, and then
the camp of Judah moved first, as Jarchi observes, and when they went
out to fight, Judah went up first, [Jdg
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md).

[Numbers 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 2:10</span></span>

On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben, according
to their armies,.... This camp consisted of the tribes of Reuben,
Simeon, and Gad, which was divided into lesser bodies, regiments, or
companies, called armies; and this was placed to the south of the
tabernacle, or to the right hand, as Aben Ezra interprets it; this was
the right wing of the whole army. Reuben's stone, according to the
Jewish writers (h), was the "sardius", and his flag was coloured red,
and there were figured upon it mandrakes. Simeon's stone was the topaz,
and his flag was coloured green, and on it was figured "shechem". Gad's
stone was the agate, and his flag was coloured neither black nor white,
but mixed, and there was figured upon it a camp or host, on account of
what is said, [Gen 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#019.md),

and the captain of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of
Shedeur; see [Num 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#005.md).

\(h\) Bemidbar Rabba, sect. 2. fol. 178. 2.

[Numbers 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 2:11</span></span>

And his host,.... That is, the host of Reuben, as distinct from his
camp, of which it was only a part, and of which Elizur was captain:

and those that were numbered thereof, were forty and six thousand and
five hundred. 46,500 men; see [Num
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#021.md).

[Numbers 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 2:12</span></span>

And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon,.... Under his
standard, and on one side of it; Reuben and Simeon being brothers by the
mother as well as the father's side, might well be thought to agree
together; and Reuben being the eldest brother, and the eldest of all
Jacob's sons, Simeon would not grudge to pitch under him:

and the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of
Zurishaddai; of whom see [Num 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#006.md).

[Numbers 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 2:13</span></span>

And his host,.... That is, the host of Simeon:

and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and nine thousand and
three hundred. 59,300 men; the same as in [Num
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#023.md).

[Numbers 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 2:14</span></span>

Then the tribe of Gad,.... Who was placed on the other side of Reuben's
standard, and according to the former direction he must be before, and
Simeon behind; and Gad being the eldest son of Leah's handmaid Zilpah,
is fitly placed under Leah's firstborn, and being the son of an
handmaid, could not object to his situation:

and the captain of the sons of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel:
who is called Deuel, [Num 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#014.md). The
letters "resh", and "daleth", being similar, are sometimes put one for
the other, of which there are other instances, as in [Gen
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#003.md), compared with [Ch1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#006.md).

[Numbers 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 2:15</span></span>

And his host,.... That is, the host of Gad, as distinct from those of
Reuben and Simeon, which together formed the camp:

and those that were numbered of them, were forty and five thousand and
six hundred and fifty. 45,650 men; see [Num
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#025.md).

[Numbers 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 2:16</span></span>

And all that were numbered in the camp of Reuben were an hundred
thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty,

throughout their armies,.... 151,450 men. Putting Reuben's host, and the
hosts of Simeon and Gad together, [Num
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#013.md), which was much lesser than the
preceding camp, being 34,500 fewer in number:

and they shall set forth in the second rank: they in journeying moving
next to the camp of Judah, and before the tabernacle; for though, while
encamped, the camp of Reuben lay on the south, or right side of it, yet,
when marching, went before it.

[Numbers 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 2:17</span></span>

Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp
of the Levites,.... Which reached four miles, according to the Targum of
Jonathan, as did Judah's. Levi's stone, as the Jews say (i), was the
carbuncle, and his flag was coloured, a third part white, and a third
part black, and a third part red, and on it were formed Urim and
Thummim:

in the midst of the camp; or "camps" (k); between the camps of Judah and
Reuben, before mentioned, and those of Ephraim and Dan, which are after
spoken of: the order in which they moved was this, as Aben Ezra
observes; the Gershonites and Merarites marched between the standard of
Judah and the standard of Reuben; and the Kohathites marched, and with
them Aaron and his sons, between the standard of Reuben and the standard
of Ephraim:

as they encamp, so shall they set forward; this is to be understood,
according to Aben Ezra, not of the camp of Levi, since the standard of
Judah was to the east, and the Gershonites, which were to the west of
the sanctuary, and the Merarites in the north, set forward together; but
of the camps of Israel, which set forward, not as they were encamped
about the tabernacle, for those that were encamped on the side of it, in
marching went before and behind, but as they were encamped with respect
to themselves; first marched the standard of Judah, then that of Reuben,
which went before, and then those of Ephraim and Dan, which followed;
and besides, as each camp was pitched, so it moved; as the camp of
Judah, his host marched between those of Issachar and Zebulun, and the
same order the rest observed:

every man in his place by their standards, as every individual person in
the several tribes were ranked under their respective banners, so they
marched.

[Numbers 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 2:18</span></span>

On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim, according
to their armies,.... It was in the rear or behind, consisting of his
tribe, and of the tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin, divided into several
companies, and extended four miles, as the above Targum. The Jewish
writers say (l), that Joseph's stone is the onyx or sardonyx, and his
flag was coloured very black, and on it were figured for the two
princes, Ephraim and Manasseh, Egypt, because they were born in Egypt;
and upon the flag of Ephraim was figured an ox, because of what is said
in [Deu 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017.md); and on the flag of the
tribe of Manasseh was figured an unicorn, because of what is said in the
same place. Benjamin's stone was the jasper, and his flag was coloured
like to twelve colours, and on it was figured a wolf, because of what is
said [Gen 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027.md),

and the captain of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of
Ammihud; of whom see [Num 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#010.md).

[Numbers 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 2:19</span></span>

And his host,.... That is, the host of Ephraim:

and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand and five
hundred. 40,500 men. Not his camp, but his host, or the army, which
consisted only of his own tribe see [Num
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#033.md).

[Numbers 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 2:20</span></span>

And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh,.... Who though the elder
brother to Ephraim, yet Ephraim was preferred to him, and had a standard
given him, and his elder brother was directed to pitch by it; and this
being agreeably to the prophecy of Jacob, could not well be objected to;
and Benjamin, the younger brother of Joseph, being placed under the
standard of a son of his, that stood in his father's room, could not be
offended; and these all being the descendants of Rachel, might well be
thought to agree together, and be very well pleased with their
situation:

and the captain of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of
Pedahzur; the same as in [Num 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#010.md).

[Numbers 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 2:21</span></span>

And his host,.... That is, the host of Manasseh:

and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and two thousand and
two hundred. 32,200 men; see [Num
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#035.md).

[Numbers 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 2:22</span></span>

Then the tribe of Benjamin,.... He was to pitch under the same standard
of Ephraim, and the other side of it from that of Manasseh; the one
being before, and the other behind, and the standard in the middle; See
Gill on [Num 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#007.md),

and the captains of the sons of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of
Gideoni; of whom see [Num 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#011.md).

[Numbers 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 2:23</span></span>

And his host, &c. That is, the host of Benjamin:

and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and five thousand and
four hundred. 35,400 men. The least number of all the tribes, excepting
the tribe of Manasseh, [Num 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#021.md); see
[Num 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#037.md).

[Numbers 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 2:24</span></span>

All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred thousand
and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their armies,.... 108,100
men. Which was the smallest of all the camps, and near eighty thousand
fewer than the camp of Judah, [Num
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#009.md),

and they shall go forward in the third rank; and which was the first
following the tabernacle.

[Numbers 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 2:25</span></span>

The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by their
armies,.... To the left of the tabernacle as encamped, and so was the
left wing of the grand army; it consisted of the tribes of Dan, Asher,
and Naphtali, in which were several divisions and companies, whose camp
also the Targum of Jonathan says reached four miles. According to the
Jewish writers (m), Dan's stone was the "ligure", and his flag was
coloured like to a sapphire, and there was figured upon it a serpent, on
account of what is said [Gen 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#017.md);
Asher's stone was the "tarshish" or beryl, and his flag was coloured
like to a precious stone, with which women adorn themselves, and on it
was figured an olive tree, on account of what is said [Gen
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020.md). Naphtali's stone was the
amethyst, and his flag was coloured like to clear wine, whose redness is
not strong, and on it was figured an hind, on account of what is said of
him [Gen 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#021.md),

and the captain of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of
Ammishaddai; who made mention of in [Num
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#010.md).

[Numbers 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 2:26</span></span>

And his host,.... That is, the host of Dan:

and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and two thousand
and seven hundred. 62,700 men, which agrees with the account of this
tribe in [Num 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#039.md).

[Numbers 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 2:27</span></span>

And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher,.... Dan had a
standard given him, though the son of an handmaid, being the firstborn
of the sons of the handmaids, and his tribe being a warlike tribe, and
very numerous; and Asher and Naphtali are placed by him, being the sons
of handmaids also, and could not but contentedly pitch by him, who was
the eldest of the sons of the handmaids Naphtali being his younger
brother by mother's as well as father's side, and Asher the second son
of Zilpah, Leah's maid:

and the captain of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of
Ocran; the same as in [Num 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#013.md).

[Numbers 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#028.md)

And his host,.... That is, the host of Asher:

and those that were numbered of them, were forty and one thousand and
five hundred. 41,500 men; as they were numbered [Num
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#041.md).

[Numbers 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 2:29</span></span>

Then the tribe of Naphtali,.... That was to pitch by the same standard
of Dan, on the other side of it:

and the captain of the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of
Enan; who is mentioned [Num 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#015.md).

[Numbers 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 2:30</span></span>

And his host,.... That is, the host of Naphtali:

and those that were numbered of them; not that some part of the tribe of
Naphtali was numbered, which made up the host Ahira was captain of, but
the whole of it, who were all numbered that were of twenty years of age
and upwards; and the same is to be observed in all the above places,
where this phrase is used:

were fifty and three thousand and four hundred. 53,400 men; see [Num
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#043.md).

[Numbers 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 2:31</span></span>

All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred thousand
and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred,.... 157,600 men.
Consisting of his own tribe, and those of Asher and Naphtali, which make
the largest camp next to Judah:

they shall go hindmost with their standards; for though, while encamped,
they lay to the north, or the left side of the tabernacle, yet, when
marching, they brought up the rear, and were the rear guard to the
tabernacle; so that it had in its van and rear the two largest camps,
which were wisely ordered for its safety: "standards" is put for
"standard", the plural for the singular; for there was but one standard
to a camp, unless this takes in their ensigns, of which they had many.

[Numbers 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 2:32</span></span>

These are those that were numbered of the children of Israel by the
house of their fathers,.... As the number was taken by Moses and Aaron,
assisted by twelve princes of the tribe, who were now constituted
captains over them, as so many hosts or armies:

all those that were numbered of the camp throughout their hosts: of the
four camps, of Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan, throughout the
respective tribes or hosts that belonged to each of them:

were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty;
603,550 men, which is exactly the sum total of them, as taken [Num
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#046.md). It is a large number,
considering in how short a time, and that great part of it a state of
bondage, from seventy persons, they rose unto it; but the spiritual
Israel of God, consisting of his people of all nations, is a number
which no man can number, [Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md);
besides, the number of the sealed ones, of every tribe, [Num
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#004.md); Now this encampment of the people
of Israel was an emblem of the form and order of the spiritual Israel or
church of God, under the Gospel dispensation. Christ in human nature is
the tabernacle, who is in the midst of his people by his gracious
presence; as the heart and life of the congregation of his saints, in
whom they all centre and terminate, and where he sits enthroned as King
of saints; and as the Levites encamped in four squadrons next unto the
tabernacle, all around it, to these answer the living creatures in [Eze
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005.md); which design the ministers of the
word, who are in the highest place in the church, between Christ and the
congregation, and are near to him, to be supplied by him; then encamped
the whole body of the people of Israel by their standards, with their
ensigns, to whom answer the wheels in [Eze
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#015.md); and the twenty four elders in
[Rev 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md); all which show the church to
be militant, and that there is an order in Gospel churches, which makes
them both comely and terrible, [Sol
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md); and may teach every member to
abide by his standard, and follow his ensign and ensign bearer, [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md).

[Numbers 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 2:33</span></span>

But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel,.... At
this time, not among the Israelites, but by themselves, they being a
camp of themselves:

as the Lord commanded Moses; [Num
1:48](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#048.md).

[Numbers 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 2:34</span></span>

And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded
Moses,.... Formed themselves into camps, so many tribes to a camp, and
over each tribe or host appointed a captain, and erected a standard to
each camp, by which they pitched as directed, which is next particularly
observed:

so they pitched by their standards; every tribe, and every person in the
tribe, as they were ranked, pitched by the standard to which they
belonged:

and so they set forward, after their families according to the house of
their fathers; the camps, and the tribes in them the families in those
tribes, and the houses or lesser families under them, when they marched,
proceeded in this regular order, as they did on the twentieth of this
month; see [Num 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011.md).
