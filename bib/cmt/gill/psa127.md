INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 127

A Song of degrees for Solomon. This psalm was written for Solomon; that
is, for the sake of Solomon, as Aben Ezra interprets it; of concerning
Solomon, as Jarchi: and so the Syriac title,

"it was said by David concerning Solomon.''

Perhaps it was composed by David, after Nathan had informed him, that
not he, but his son Solomon, should build a temple for the Lord; and
when he had made provision of gold and silver, and other things, for it,
and had given the pattern of it to his son; and encouraged and animated
him to it, assuring him that the Lord would be with him until he had
finished it; and prayed that God would give him a perfect heart to do
it; for he knew the whole success depended upon the Lord,
notwithstanding all the preparations he had made: hence the psalm
begins, "except the Lord build the house"; see [Ch1
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020.md). Theodoret is of opinion it was
written for Zerubbabel, and respects the building of the second temple
by him; who is called Solomon, because he descended from him, and
restored his work; but Zerubbabel, though he was of the house of David,
yet not in the line of Solomon, but of Nathan, [Luk
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#027.md). The inscription of the Syriac
version seems to agree with this conjecture; which adds, to what is
before observed,

"and it is also said concerning Haggai and Zechariah, who were
solicitous for the building of the temple.''

And Arama the Jew says, that it is possible it may be said of the
building of the second temple, and the walls of Jerusalem. But others
think it is a composition of Solomon himself; who might set out upon the
building of the temple with this song, as he made a prayer at the
dedication of it when finished: and the Targum renders it,

"a song by the hand of Solomon;''

and our translators for the most part render the particle of, which they
here translate "for", as "of David", in many places. And so accordingly
it may be rendered here "of Solomon" (s), or Solomon's, and be one of
the thousand and five songs he made; which, besides that called the Song
of Solomon, is the only one extant: and the doctrine of it agrees with
many things in the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes; that all things
depend upon the providence and blessing of God, without which all the
endeavours of men are in vain. Kimchi thinks the Messiah is meant, who
is often called Solomon in the book of Canticles, [Sol
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007.md); and to whom many passages in it
may be applied.

[Psalms 127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 127:1</span></span>

Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it,....
Whether it be understood literally of an artificial house, as Solomon's
own house; or the house of the Lord, or any other: let a man be ever so
bent upon building one, or have ever so much skill in drawing the plan
of it, or be ever so well provided to go through the expense of it, or
have ever so many hands employed in it, yet, if the Lord does not give
success, it will all be in vain; the building will fall down, or be
consumed by fire before it is finished; or by one providence or another
he will be obliged to desist from it, as in the case of the builders of
the tower and city of Babel. Or whether it be understood of a family,
which is built up by an increase and multiplication of children; so Leah
and Rachel built up the house of Israel, [Rut
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011.md); this depends upon the providence
of God; for, as it is after said, "children are an heritage of the
Lord", [Psa 127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md). Or whether it be
understood, figuratively and mystically, of the church God, the house of
the living God; the house of Christ, a spiritual one; a Gospel church,
whose materials are lively stones, or true believers. Now there are
builders in this house, some indeed very bad ones; and it is no wonder
that they labour in vain, who reject and lay aside the foundation and
corner stone, Christ; who deny his deity, despise his righteousness; or
mix grace and works, law and Gospel, together, and pluck down with one
hand what they build with another: and though there are others that are
good ones, and lay the foundation, Christ; and build on this foundation
precious truths, comparable to gold, silver, and precious stones;
minister the word, and administer the ordinances, truly and faithfully;
and in all direct to Christ for grace, strength, peace, comfort, and
eternal life; speak to edification, and are the means of reviving the
graces of God's people, and of establishing their souls; as well as of
the conversion of sinners, whereby the house of God is built up; yet if
the Lord does not prosper their work, all is in vain. For the principal
builder is God, Father, Son, and Spirit; this is mostly applied to the
second Person, the Word and Wisdom of God, [Pro
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md); but not to the exclusion of the
Father, who has laid in Zion a foundation, a precious corner stone, and
builds souls on it; nor of the Spirit, through whom saints are built up
an habitation for God, [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md). The
Targum here is,

"if the Word of the Lord does not build the city.''

It follows,

except the Lord keep the city; the city Jerusalem, as the Targum; who
also here makes mention of the Word of the Lord: or any other city: God,
with the Heathens (t) was called the keeper of cities; this title is
given to Minerva by Pindar (u), and is one of Jupiter's titles (w);

the watchman waketh but in vain; to preserve it from riots, robberies,
fires, &c. This may be applied to the church of God, the city of the
living God, of which saints are fellow citizens: now in this city there
are watchmen, some indeed that are blind and asleep, and so quite unfit
for this office; but there are others who are awake and diligent, and
watch in all things; and for the souls of men, and the good of the city,
the church, to prevent heresies, errors, and immoralities; and yet all
their watchfulness is in vain, unless the Lord keep it, who watches over
his people for good, and that none hurt them; he wakeful, never slumbers
nor sleeps, and constant night and day; and keeps his people by his
power, and as tenderly as the apple of his eye.

[Psalms 127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 127:2</span></span>

It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late,.... A description
of an industrious and laborious person, who takes great pains to get a
livelihood, or increase his substance; see [Psa
104:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#023.md); which, yet, as in the former
instances, depends upon the blessing of divine Providence, [Pro
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004.md). For, after all, it may come to
nothing more at last than

to eat the bread of sorrows; that is, to eat bread gotten with much
sorrow and labour; such get bread, and that is all, and not that without
the providence of God;

for so he giveth his beloved sleep; that is, the Lord: such who are
partakers of his grace, that fear and love him; to them, thus diligent
and industrious, he gives not only bread to eat, but sleep, which to a
labouring man is sweet; and having food and raiment, he gives them
contentment, quietness, and satisfaction of mind, which is the greatest
blessing of all. Sleep, even bodily sleep, was reckoned with the very
Heathens a divine gift (x). Some think respect is had to, Solomon, whose
name was Jedidiah, and signifies the beloved of the Lord, [Sa2
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#024.md); to whom God gave peace, rest,
and safety all around; or, as others, the kingdom without labour, when
Absalom and Adonijah toiled for it: Christ, who is the Beloved of the
Lord, the Son of his love, his well beloved Son, may be thought of,
whose rest is glorious; his sleep in the grave, where his flesh rested
from his labours and sufferings, in hope of the resurrection of it: and
it may be applied to all the Lord's beloved ones; to whom he gives
spiritual rest in this world, sleep in the arms of Jesus at death, and
an everlasting rest in the world to come; all which depends not on their
endeavours, but on his grace and goodness.

[Psalms 127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 127:3</span></span>

Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord,.... As all success, safety,
and the blessings of life, depend on the providence of God; so this very
great blessing is a gift of his; having children, and those good ones,
as the Targum interprets it; for of such only can it be understood: so,
in a spiritual sense, the children of Christ, the antitypical Solomon,
are the gifts of his heavenly Father to him; his portion and
inheritance, and a goodly heritage he esteems them;

and the fruit of the womb is his reward; "fruit" (y) is the same with
"children" in the preceding clause; see [Luk
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042.md); a reward he gives to good men,
not of debt, but of grace; the Targum,

"a reward of good works:''

so regenerate persons are a reward to Christ, of his sufferings and
death, [Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 127:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 127:4</span></span>

As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man,.... Are shot out with great
strength; come with much force, and do execution, and do not return in
vain; with which men defend themselves, and annoy their enemies; see
[Jer 50:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#009.md);

so are children of the youth: not young children, or children in their
youth; but such who are born to their parents when they are in their
youth; and which are generally healthful and strong, and their parents
live to see them grown up; and who are useful to protect them, and
defend their persons and properties from enemies when grown old and
feeble, and unable to defend themselves: whereas children born to them
in old age are generally unhealthy and weak; and besides, their parents
rarely live to see them brought up, or to be helpful to them. So
Christ's spiritual seed and offspring, who are the dew of his youth, are
strong, and overcome the evil one; and are serviceable in the defence of
his cause and interest.

[Psalms 127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 127:5</span></span>

Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them,.... That is, his
house full of them; called a quiver, referring to arrows before
mentioned, this being the case in which they are put up: to have many
children was always reckoned a great temporal blessing and happiness;
see [Job 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#002.md). The Septuagint, Vulgate
Latin, Ethiopic, and Arabic versions, render it, "that fills his desire"
has as many as he desires or wishes for: the Targum,

"who fills his school of them:''

so Jarchi interprets the children, of the disciples of the wise men. It
may be applied to young converts, the children of Christ and of the
church; which, when numerous, is a blessing to him and her; see [Isa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020.md);

they shall not be ashamed; the father and his children, as Aben Ezra;
parents rather are meant, who are not ashamed when they have many
children: with the Romans (z), those that had wives and children were
preferred in honour to senior persons that had none; and they that had
most to those that had fewest; and so with the Persians; See Gill on
[Est 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#011.md);

but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate: where courts of
judicature were kept; and so the Targum,

"in the gate of the house of judgment.''

The sense is, that their children should stand and plead the cause of
their parents against their adversaries in courts of judicature; or
publicly before the eyes of all, as Aben Ezra: and spiritually may
design such of Christ's seed who are set for the defence of the Gospel,
are valiant for the truth on earth, and earnestly contend for it; meet
the enemy in the gate, publicly oppose him, and behave themselves like
men, and are strong.
