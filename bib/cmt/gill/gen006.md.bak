### [Genesis Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 6

This chapter gives an account of the wickedness of the old world, both
among the profane and the professors of religion, which was taken notice
of and resented by God, upon which he determined the destruction of it,
[Gen 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md) only one man, Noah, is
excepted, who found favour with God, and whose character is given, [Gen
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#008.md) and to whom was observed by God
the general corruption of the earth, [Gen
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011.md) and to whom he gave orders and
directions for the building an ark for himself, and his family, being
determined to destroy the earth with a flood, and all creatures in it,
[Gen 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014.md) only he would preserve him
and his wife, his three sons and their wives, and two of every living
creature, for which, and for himself and his family, he was to take food
into the ark when built, [Gen 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#018.md) and
the chapter is concluded with observing, that Noah did as he was
commanded, [Gen 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#022.md).

[Genesis 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 6:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, when men began to multiply upon the face of the
earth,.... Either mankind in general, or rather the posterity of Cain,
who were mere natural men, such as they were when born into the world,
and as brought up in it, destitute of the grace of God, and of the
knowledge and fear of him; and who in proportion much more multiplied
than the posterity of Seth, because of the practice of polygamy, which
by the example of Lamech, one of that race, might prevail among them:

and daughters were born unto them; not daughters only, but sons also,
though it may be more daughters than sons, or it may denote remarkable
ones, for their beauty or immodesty, or both; and chiefly this is
observed for the sake of what follows.

[Genesis 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 6:2</span></span>

That the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair,....
Or "good" (k), not in a moral but natural sense; goodly to look upon, of
a beautiful aspect; and they looked upon, and only regarded their
external beauty, and lusted after them: those "sons of God" were not
angels either good or bad, as many have thought, since they are
incorporeal beings, and cannot be affected with fleshly lusts, or marry
and be given in marriage, or generate and be generated; nor the sons of
judges, magistrates, and great personages, nor they themselves, as the
Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, and so Jarchi and Aben Ezra; but this
could be no crime in them, to look upon and take in marriage such
persons, though they were the daughters of the meaner sort; and
supposing they acted a criminal part in looking at them, and lusting
after them, and committing fornication with them, and even in marrying
irreligious persons; yet this could only be a partial, not an universal
corruption, as is after affirmed, though such examples must indeed have
great influence upon the populace; but rather this is to be understood
of the posterity of Seth, who from the times of Enos, when then began to
be called by the name of the Lord, [Gen
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025.md) had the title of the sons of God,
in distinction from the children of men; these claimed the privilege of
divine adoption, and professed to be born of God, and partakers of his
grace, and pretended to worship him according to his will, so far as
revealed to them, and to fear and serve and glorify him. According to
the Arabic writers (l), immediately after the death of Adam the family
of Seth was separated from the family of Cain; Seth took his sons and
their wives to a high mountain (Hermon), on the top of which Adam was
buried, and Cain and all his sons lived in the valley beneath, where
Abel was slain; and they on the mountain obtained a name for holiness
and purity, and were so near the angels that they could hear their
voices and join their hymns with them; and they, their wives and their
children, went by the common name of the sons of God: and now these were
adjured, by Seth and by succeeding patriarchs, by no means to go down
from the mountain and join the Cainites; but notwithstanding in the
times of Jared some did go down, it seems; See Gill on [Gen
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#020.md) and after that others, and at
this time it became general; and being taken with the beauty of the
daughters of Cain and his posterity, they did as follows:

and they took them wives of all that they chose; not by force, as Aben
Ezra and Ben Gersom interpret, for the Cainites being more numerous and
powerful than they, it can hardly be thought that the one would attempt
it, or the other suffer it; but they intermarried with them, which the
Cainites might not be averse unto; they took to them wives as they
fancied, which were pleasing to the flesh, without regard to their moral
and civil character, and without the advice and consent of their
parents, and without consulting God and his will in the matter; or they
took women as they pleased, and were to their liking, and committed
fornication, to which the Cainites were addicted; for they spent their
time in singing and dancing, and in uncleanness, whereby the posterity
of Seth or sons of God were allured to come down and join them, and
commit fornication with them, as the Arabic writers (m) relate.

[Genesis 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 6:3</span></span>

And the Lord said,.... Not to Noah, as in [Gen
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#013.md) for, as yet, he is not taken
notice of, or any discourse addressed to him; but rather to or within
himself, he said what follows, or thus concluded, and resolved on in his
own mind:

my Spirit shall not always strive with man; meaning either the soul of
man, called the Spirit of God, [Job
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#003.md) because of his creation, and is
what he breathes and puts into men, and therefore is styled the Father
of spirits; and which is in man, as some in Aben Ezra observe to be the
sense the word used, as a sword in the scabbard; and so the meaning is,
it shall not always abide there, but be unsheathed and drawn out; man
shall not live always, since he is corrupt, and given to carnal lusts:
or else, as Jarchi thinks, God himself is meant, and that the sense is,
my Spirit shall not always contend within myself; or there shall not
always be contention within me concerning man, whether I shall destroy
him, or have mercy on him; I am at a point to punish him, since he is
wholly carnal: or rather this is to be understood of the Holy Spirit of
God, as the Targum of Jonathan, which agrees with [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md) and to be thus interpreted; that
the Spirit of God, which had been litigating and reasoning the point, as
men do in a court of judicature, as the word signifies, with these men
in the court, and at the bar of their own consciences, by one providence
or by one minister or another, particularly by Noah, a preacher of
righteousness, in vain, and to no purpose; therefore, he determines to
proceed no longer in this way, but pass and execute the sentence of
condemnation on them:

for that he also is flesh; not only carnal and corrupt, but sadly
corrupted, and wholly given up to and immersed in sensual lusts and
carnal pleasures, so as not to be restrained nor reformed; even the
posterity of Seth, professors of religion also, as well as the profane
world and posterity of Cain:

yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years: meaning not the term
of man's life, reduced to this from the length of time he lived before
the flood; but this designs the space that God would give for
repentance, before he proceeded to execute his vengeance on him; this is
that "longsuffering of God" the apostle speaks of in the afore mentioned
place, "that waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing";
and so both the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan interpret it of a space
of an hundred and twenty years given them to repent: now whereas it was
but an hundred years from the birth of Japheth to the flood, some think
the space was shortened twenty years, because of their impenitence; but
it is more probable what Jarchi observes, that this decree was made and
given out twenty years before his birth, though here related, by a
figure called "hysteron proteron", frequent in the Scriptures.

[Genesis 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 6:4</span></span>

There were giants in the earth in those days,.... That is, in the days
before the sons of God took the daughters of men for wives, in such a
general manner as before declared, or before the declension and apostasy
became so universal; even in the times of Jared, as the Arabic writers
(n) understand it, who say that these giants were begotten on the
daughters of Cain by the children of Seth, who went down from the
mountain to them in the days of Jared, see [Gen
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#020.md) the word "Nephilim" comes from a
word which signifies to fall; and these might be so called, either
because they made their fear to fall upon men, or men, through fear, to
fall before them, because of their height and strength; or rather
because they fell and rushed on men with great violence, and oppressed
them in a cruel and tyrannical manner; or, as some think, because they
fell off and were apostates from the true religion, which is much better
than to understand them of apostate angels, whom the Targum of Jonathan
mentions by name, and calls them Schanchazai and Uziel, who fell from
heaven, and were in the earth in those days:

and also after that, which shows that the preceding clause respects
giants in former times:

when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, came into their
houses and chambers, and lay with them:

and they bare children unto them, or giants unto them, as may be
supplied from the former clause; for the sense is, as there were giants
before this general defection, so there were at this time, when there
was a mixture of the Cainites and Sethites; which were the offspring of
the sons of God, or posterity of Seth, mixing with the daughters of men,
or the posterity of Cain; for this is not to be understood after the
flood, as Aben Ezra, Ben Melech; and so they are described in the
following words:

the same became mighty men; for tallness and strength, for power and
dominion, for tyranny and oppression:

which were of old: like those that were of old before; or who in after
times were spoken of, as in the days of old:

men of renown, or "of name" (o); whose names were often made mention of,
both for their size and for their wickedness; they were much talked of,
and extolled for their exploits, and even wicked ones: they were famous
men, or rather infamous; for some men get a name in the world, not for
their goodness, but for their greatness, and sometimes for their great
wickedness; which sense is countenanced by what follows: that there were
giants in these early times is confirmed by the testimony of many
Heathen writers; such were the Titans that made war against Saturn,
begotten by Ouranus, who were not only of bulky bodies, but of
invincible strength, as Apollodorus (p) relates, and Berosus (q) speaks
of a city about Lebanon, called Enos, which was a city of giants, who
were men of vast bodies, and of great strength, inventors of arms and
music, were cannibals, and exceedingly debauched.

[Genesis 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 6:5</span></span>

And God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth,.... That it
spread throughout the earth, wherever it was inhabited by men, both
among the posterity of Cain and Seth, and who indeed now were mixed
together, and become one people: this respects actual transgressions,
the wicked actions of men, and those of the grosser sort, which were
"multiplied" (r) as the word also signifies; they were both great in
quality and great in quantity; they were frequently committed, and that
everywhere; the degeneracy was become universal; there was a flood of
impiety that spread and covered the whole earth, before the deluge of
waters came, and which was the cause of it: this God saw, not only by
his omniscience, by which he sees everything, but he took notice of it
in his providence, and was displeased with it, and determined in his
mind to show his resentment of it, and let men see that he observed it,
and disapproved of it, and would punish for it:

and that, every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually: the heart of man is evil and wicked, desperately wicked,
yea, wickedness itself, a fountain of iniquity, out of which abundance
of evil flows, by which it may be known in some measure what is in it,
and how wicked it is; but God, that sees it, only knows perfectly all
the wickedness of it, and the evil that is in it: the "thoughts" of his
heart are evil; evil thoughts are formed in the heart, and proceed from
it; they are vain, foolish, and sinful, and abominable in the sight of
God, by whom they are seen, known, and understood afar off: the
"imagination" of his thoughts is evil, the formation of them; they were
evil while forming, the substratum of thought, the very beginning of it,
the first motion to it, yea, "every" such one was evil, and "only" so;
not one good among them, not one good thing in their hearts, no one good
thought there, nor one good imagination of the thought; and so it was
"continually" from their birth, from their youth upwards, throughout the
whole of their lives, and all the days of their lives, night and day,
and day after day, without intermission: this respects the original
corruption of human nature, and shows it to be universal; for this was
not only true of the men of the old world, but of all mankind; the same
is said of men after the flood as before, and of all men in general
without any exception, [Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md).
Hence appears the necessity of regeneration, and proves that the new
creature is not an improvement of the old principles of corrupt nature,
since there is no good thing in man but what is put into him; also the
disability of man to do that which is good, even to think a good
thought, or do a good action; therefore the works of unregenerate men
are not properly good works, since they cannot flow from a right
principle, or be directed to a right end.

[Genesis 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 6:6</span></span>

And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth,.... Because
of the wickedness of man, the wickedness of his heart, and the
wickedness of his life and conversation, which was so general, and
increased to such a degree, that it was intolerable; wherefore God could
have wished, as it were, that he had never made him, since he proved so
bad; not that repentance, properly speaking, can fall upon God, for he
never changes his mind or alters his purposes, though he sometimes
changes the course and dispensations of his providence. This is speaking
by an anthropopathy, after the manner of men, because God determined to
do, and did something similar to men, when they repent of anything: as a
potter, when he has formed a vessel that does not please him, and he
repents that he has made it, he takes it and breaks it in pieces; and so
God, because of man's wickedness, and to show his aversion to it, and
displicency at it, repented of his making him; that is, he resolved
within himself to destroy him, as in the next verse, which explains
this:

and it grieved him at his heart; this is to be understood by the same
figure as before, for there can, no more be any uneasiness in his mind
than a change in it; for God is a simple Being, uncompounded, and not
subject to any passions and affections. This is said to observe his
great hatred to sin, and abhorrence of it.

[Genesis 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 6:7</span></span>

And the Lord said,.... Not to the angels, nor to Noah, but within
himself, on observing to what a height the sin of man had got, and what
a spread it made on the earth:

I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth;
though he is my creature, the work of my hands, I have made him out of
the earth, and made him lord of it; I am now determined to show my
detestation of his wickedness, and for the honour of my justice to
destroy him from off it; just as a potter takes a vessel he dislikes,
when he has made it, and dashes it to pieces: or "I will wipe men off of
the earth" (s); like so much dust; man was made of the dust of the
earth, he is dust, yea, sinful dust and ashes; and God resolved to send
a flood of waters on the earth, which should wash off man from it, like
so much dust upon it, just as dust is carried off by a flood of water,
see [Kg2 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013.md) or "I will blot out
man" (t), as most render the words; that is, out of the book of the
living, he shall no longer live upon the earth; out of the book of
creation, or of the creatures, he shall have no more a being, or be seen
among them, any more than what is blotted out of a book:

both man and beast; or "from man to beast" (u); even every living
creature upon the earth, from man to beast, one as well as another, and
one for the sake of the other, the beasts for the sake of man; these
were made for his use and benefit, but he sinning against God, and
abusing his mercies, they are to be taken away, and destroyed for his
sake, and as a punishment for his sins:

and the creeping things, and the fowls of the air; not the creeping
things in the great and wide sea, for the fishes died not in the deluge,
but the creeping things on the earth, [Gen
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#020.md).

for it repenteth me that I have made them; man, male and female, whom he
created; Adam and Eve, and their posterity, and particularly the present
inhabitants of the earth: but though it may respect men principally, yet
is not to be restrained to them, but takes in all the creatures before
mentioned, made for the use of man; and the ends not being answered by
them, God repented that he had made them, as well as man. Some think the
repentance, attributed to God in this and the preceding verse, is not to
be understood of him in himself, but of his Spirit in good men,
particularly Noah, producing grief, sorrow, and repentance in him, who
wished that man had never been, than to be so wicked as he was; but for
such a sense there seems to be no manner of foundation in the text.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 6:8</span></span>

But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. This man and his family
were the only exception to the general apostasy; God always reserves
some, in the worst of times, for himself; there is a remnant, according
to the election of grace; it was but a small one, and that now appeared;
and this was owing to the grace of God, and his choice upon that, and
not to the merits of the creature. This grace, which Noah found and
shared in, was the favour and good will of God; Noah was grateful and
acceptable to him; he was well pleased with him in Christ; his person,
services, and sacrifices, were acceptable to him through the Beloved;
though he might not be acceptable in the eyes of men, who derided him
for his piety and devotion, and especially for his prediction of the
flood, and making an ark to save him and his family from it; yet he was
very acceptable in the eyes of the Lord, and grateful in his sight, and
was favoured with grace from him, who is the God of all grace, and with
all the supplies of it: the Jerusalem Targum is, he"found grace and
mercy;''the grace he found was not on account of his own merit, but on
account of the mercy of God: and this shows that he was not without sin,
or he would have stood in no need of the mercy and grace of God to save
him; and as he found grace and favour in things spiritual, so in things
temporal; he found favour with God, and therefore he and his family were
spared, when the whole world of the ungodly were destroyed; he found
favour with God, and therefore was directed by him to build an ark, for
the saving of himself and his; he found favour with him, and therefore
he had the honour of being the preserver of mankind, and the father of a
new world.

[Genesis 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 6:9</span></span>

These are the generations of Noah,.... Or this is the account of his
posterity, of the persons that were generated by him, that sprung from
him, and peopled the earth after the flood, who are mentioned in the
next verse, what follows being to be put in a parenthesis; as the
genealogy of Adam is carried on from Adam to Noah, [Gen
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md) so the old world ending at the
flood, the genealogy of the new world begins with Noah: though Aben Ezra
and Ben Gersome interpret the word "events", things which days bring
forth, [Pro 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001.md) these are the events
or the things which befell Noah, of which an account is given in this
and some following chapters, whose character is next observed:

Noah was a just man; not only before men, but in the sight of God; and
not by his own works of righteousness, for no man is just by them before
God, but by the righteousness of the promised seed, the Messiah; for he
"became heir of the righteousness which is by faith", [Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md) the righteousness which was to be
brought in by the Son of God, and which was revealed to him from faith
to faith; and which by faith he received and lived upon, as every just
man does, and believed in as his justifying righteousness before God;
though he also lived a holy and righteous conversation before men, which
may rather be intended in the next part of his character:

and perfect in his generations; not that he was perfectly holy, or free
from sin, but was a partaker of the true grace of God; was sincere and
upright in heart and life; lived an unblemished life and conversation,
untainted with the gross corruptions of that age he lived in, which he
escaped through the knowledge, grace, and fear of God; and therefore it
is added, that he was holy, upright, and blameless "in his generations":
among the men of the several generations he lived in, as in the
generation before the flood, which was very corrupt indeed, and which
corruption was the cause of that; and in the generation after the flood:
or "in his ages" (w), in the several stages of his life, in youth and in
old age; he was throughout the whole course of his life a holy good man.

And Noah walked with God: walked according to his will, in the ways of
truth and righteousness; walked in a manner well pleasing to him, and
enjoyed much communion with him, as Enoch had done before him, [Gen
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md).

And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. When he was five
hundred years of age, and before the flood came upon the earth; and when
it was so wicked as is next described: of these sons of his, and of the
order in which they are placed; see Gill on [Gen

[Genesis 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 6:11</span></span>

The earth also was corrupt before God,.... That is, the inhabitants of
the earth were corrupt in their lives and conversations; they were
corrupt both in principle and practice, and did abominable things; and
those corruptions were, according to Jarchi, uncleanness and idolatry;
they were corrupt in the worship of God, worshipping the creature more,
or besides the Creator; and they were corrupt in their manners and
behaviour to one another, being guilty of fornication and adultery, and
other enormous crimes; of some against God, and of others against their
neighbours; and these they committed openly and impudently, without any
fear of God, or dread of his wrath and displeasure, and in contempt of
him, his will and laws:

and the earth was filled with violence; with doing injury to the persons
and properties of men; with oppression and cruelty, by tyrannical
decrees and unrighteous judgments; or with rapines and robberies, as the
Targums and Jarchi; and with rapes, as Aben Ezra adds: the account that
Lucian (x) gives from tradition agrees with this; that the present race
of men is not the first, they totally perished by a flood; and those men
were very insolent and addicted to unjust actions; for they neither kept
their oaths, nor were hospitable to strangers, nor gave ear to
suppliants, for which reason they were destroyed.

[Genesis 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 6:12</span></span>

And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt,.... This is
spoken as if he had never looked upon it before; whereas his eyes are
always upon the earth, and the inhabitants of it, and upon all their
ways and works: but this denotes the special notice he took, and the
particular observation he made upon the condition and circumstances the
earth, and its inhabitants, were in. And this is remarked, as well as
the particle "behold" is used, to denote the certainty of this
corruption; it must needs be true, that the earth was corrupted, since
the omniscient God had declared it to be so, who sees and knows all
things:

for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth: that is, all men,
excepting Noah; who were flesh, carnal and unregenerate persons; these
had corrupted the way of God, the true religion, with their idolatries:
and they had corrupted their own way, their manners, their life and
conversation with their uncleanness and wickedness of various sorts: the
Arabic writers (y) say, that after Enoch was taken away, the children of
Seth and of Cain worshipped idols, everyone as he pleased, and were
immersed in wickedness, and gave their right hands to each other, and
joined in fellowship in committing sin and vice; and that in the times
of Noah, none were left in the holy mount but he and his wife, and his
three sons and their wives; all went down below and mixed with the
daughters of Cain, and were immersed in sins, and worshipped strange
gods, and so the earth was corrupted and filled with lasciviousness. The
Jewish writers also observe (z), that the generations of Cain were
guilty of uncleanness, men and women, like beasts, and defiled
themselves with all kind of fornication and incest, everyone with his
mother, and with his own sister, and with his brother's wife, and that
openly, and in the streets: and Sanchoniatho (a), the Heathen historian,
the writer of the history of Cain's line, says of the fifth generation
before the flood, that the women of those times, without shame, lay with
any man they could meet with.

And God said unto Noah,.... This is a proof that he found favour in his
eyes, since he spake to him, and told him what he had observed, and what
he was determined to do, and gave him directions to make an ark for the
security of himself and family, when he should destroy the world:

the end of all flesh is come before me; that is, it was determined to
put an end to the lives of all men, and of all cattle, and fowl and
creeping things on the earth; all which are included in the phrase, "all
flesh", even every living substance on the earth:

for the earth is filled with violence through them; that is, through
men, for they are principally intended in the preceding clause, though
not only; and it was through them, and not through other creatures, that
the earth was filled with violence, in the sense in which it is
explained in See Gill on [Gen 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011.md),

and behold, I will destroy them with the earth; meaning, that he would
destroy all men, together with the cattle and creeping things of the
earth, the trees, and herbs, and plants in it, yea, that itself, for
that is said to perish by the flood, [Pe2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#006.md). Some render it, "out of the
earth" (b); that is, would destroy them from it, that they should be no
more on it.

Make thee an ark of Gopher wood,.... It is not called a ship, for it was
not made for sailing to any distant parts, but an ark or chest, being
like one, flat bottomed, and ridged and sloping upwards, and was made
for floating on the waters for a little way. So Lucian (c), and other
Heathen writers, call it "an ark" or "chest": this was made of "Gopher
wood", which all the Targums, and the more ancient Rabbins, understand
of cedar wood; some the box tree, as the Arabic version; others, the
pine; others, fir; the Mahometans say it was the Indian plane tree; and
others, the turpentine tree: but the cypress tree bids fairest to be the
wood of which, the ark was made, as Fuller (d), Bochart (e), and others
(f) have shown; that being nearest to "Gopher" in sound, and being a
wood very durable and incorruptible, and fit for shipping. Alexander
made a navy of cypress trees in the groves and gardens about Babylon, as
Strabo (g) relates: where this ark was made, is not easy to say: some
think in Palestine; others, near Mount Caucasus, on the borders of
India; others, in China: but it is most likely it was near the garden of
Eden, where Noah lived, and not far from Ararat, where the ark rested.
Bochart (h) conjectures, that "Gopher" is the name of the place where it
was made, as well as of the wood of which it was made; and that it might
be Cupressetum or Cyparisson, which Strabo (i) places in Assyria. How
long Noah was building the ark is variously conjectured: a Jewish (k)
writer says fifty two years; and an Arabic writer (l) an hundred years;
others think Noah was building it the whole one hundred and twenty years
(m), the time of God's longsuffering and forbearance, which some
conclude from [Pe1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020.md) but though it
would require not a few years to build such a vessel, and prepare
everything necessary for the use of it, yet one would think it should
not take so many years as the least account gives unto it: it may be
observed, the order is, "make thou", or "for thyself" (n); for thy use
and benefit, for the saving of thyself and family, as well as for the
preservation of the several creatures which were for the service of him
and his posterity:

rooms shalt thou make in the ark; or "nests" (o); little apartments, and
many of them for the several creatures, and for their provisions, as
well as for Noah and his family. The Targum of Jonathan gives us the
number of them, paraphrasing the words thus,"one hundred and fifty cells
shalt thou make for the ark on the left hand, and ten apartments in the
middle to put food in, and five cabins on the right, and five on the
left:"

and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch; it was pitched without
to keep out the waters, and that they might more easily slide off, and
to preserve the ark from being eat with worms, or hurt with the wind and
sun; and it was pitched within, to take off the ill smell that might
arise from the several creatures, as well as for the better security of
the ark. Some take it to be bitumen, a sort of clay or slime like pitch,
such as was used at the building of Babel, and of the walls of Babylon.
De Dieu conjectures it was that kind of bitumen which the Arabs calls
Kaphura, which agrees in sound with the word here used; but why not the
pitch of the pine tree, or the rosin of the cypress tree, and especially
the latter, if the ark was made of the wood of it (p)?

And this is the fashion which thou shall make it of,.... The form and
size of it, its length, breadth, and height, as follows:

the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it
fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits; which some interpret
of geometrical cubits, each of which contained six ordinary cubits;
others of sacred cubits, which were larger by an hand's breadth than the
common cubit; but the general opinion of learned men now is, that they
were common cubits of eighteen inches long; and by the geometrical
calculations made by them it is found, that the ark of such dimensions
was abundantly sufficient to contain Noah, and his family, and the
various creatures, and all necessary provisions for them (q). But if the
Jewish and Egyptian cubit, the cubit of the Scriptures, as Dr.
Cumberland (r) has shown it to be, consisted of twenty one inches and
upwards, the ark according to them must be very near twice as great, and
so more convenient for all the ends to which it was designed; for, as he
observes, the cube of such a cubit is very near double to the cube of
eighteen inches, and therefore so must the capacity be. (Noah's Ark was
the largest sea-going vessel ever built, until, the late nineteenth
century when giant metal ships were first constructed. The Ark was
approximately 450 feet by seventy five feet; but as late as 1858"the
largest vessel of her type in the world was the P&O liner, "Himalaya",
240 feet by thirty five feet...''In that year, Isambard K. Brunel
produced the "Great Eastern", 692 feet by 83 feet by 30 feet of
approximately 19000 tons ... five times the tonnage of any ship then
afloat. So vast was Brunel's leap that even forty years later in an age
of fierce competition the largest liners being built were still smaller
than the "Great Eastern" ... (s). Editor.)

A window shalt thou make to the ark,.... Or a "light", such as is that
at noon, for which the word in the dual number is used; and therefore
Junius and Tremellius translate it a "clear light". The Jewish writers
(s) will have it to be a precious stone, a pearl which Noah fetched from
the river Pison, and hung up in the ark, and it gave light to all the
creatures, like a large chandelier; but a window no doubt it was to let
light into the several apartments, and to look out at on occasion, since
Noah is afterwards said to open it; but what it was made of is difficult
to say, since it does not appear that as yet glass was invented. Some
think it was made of crystal, which would let in light, and keep off the
water. A very learned (t) man is of opinion, that Noah understanding
chemistry, prepared a fine subtle fragrant spirit, of an oily nature and
luminous, which he put into vessels made of crystal or glass, and hung
them up in every room in the ark, and which was both illuminating and
refreshing; and this he thinks is what is meant by the "Zohar", or
"light", which we translate a "window"; but this is afterward said to be
opened by Noah, to send forth the raven and the dove, which will not
agree with such a vessel of spirituous liquor:

and in a cubit shall thou finish it above; not the window, as some
think, which they place at top of the ark, and suppose to be a cubit in
length, but the ark itself, which was finished with a roof raised up a
cubit high in the middle:

and the door of the ark shall thou set in the side thereof; on which it
is not said; an Arabic writer (u) places it on the east side of it, on
which side he supposes Noah and his sons dwelt, and on the west side his
wife and his sons' wives. How large this door was is not said; it is
reasonably supposed (w) to be ten cubits high and eight broad, that
there might be room enough for an elephant to enter in by it; and it
seems it was so large, that Noah, and those with him, could not shut it,
but it was done by the Lord, [Gen
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#016.md).

with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it: the above
Arabic writer (x) makes the lower story to be for the beasts, the second
for the birds, and the third for Noah and his children; and with him
agrees a Jewish writer (y): but as by this distribution no place is left
for provisions, they seem most correct who place the beasts in the lower
story, and the birds with Noah and his family in the uppermost, and the
provisions for all in the middle. This ark was a type of the church of
God. As to the form and pattern of it, it was of God, so the separation
of men from the world in a church state is of God; it is by his
appointment, and it is his will, that when any numbers of men are
converted in a place, that they should be incorporated together in a
church state, the form of which is given by him, its officers appointed,
and the laws and ordinances of it fixed by him: and as to the matter of
it, "Gopher wood", a lasting and incorruptible wood, denoting the
duration of the church; God ever had, and ever will have a church in the
world: as to the parts of it, and rooms in it, the rooms may point at
particular churches, of which there have been many; or may signify, that
there is always room enough in the church of God to receive saints. The
ark had three stories in it, as the tabernacle and temple had three
divisions, which were types of the same also; and may have respect to
the visible church, consisting of believers and unbelievers, the
invisible church, or general assembly of the firstborn, whose names are
written in heaven, and the church triumphant. The door into the ark may
signify Christ, who, and faith in him, may be said to be the door into
the church, and to all the ordinances of it: the window may either
typify the glorious light of the Gospel, held forth in the church, or
the ordinances of it, to which sensible souls betake themselves, as
doves to their windows, [Isa 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008.md).
Into this ark not only Noah and his family, but creatures of all sorts
were admitted, as sinners of all sorts called by grace, and become
peaceable, are received into the church of God; yea, even good and bad
have a place here, though the latter under the notion and character of
the former, but are hypocrites in Zion: here also were plenty of
provisions for all in it, as there are in the church of God fulness of
spiritual provisions for all the people of God. The ark was of the use
of a ship, and was the means of saving a few men, even Noah and his
family; so the church of God has the nature and use of a ship, of which
Christ is the pilot, and conducts it through the sea of this world, in
which it is often tossed with tempests, and distressed; but at last
brought to its haven, in which a few are saved, not as the cause, which
alone is Christ, but as the means. The Apostle Peter makes baptism its
antitype, [Pe1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md) which is God's
ordinance, and not man's, of his appointing; as to the form and manner
of it, is the object of the world's scorn, when rightly administered, as
Noah's ark was; represents a burial, as that did when Noah entered into
it; and was an emblem of Christ's resurrection and ours, when he came
out of it: it was a type of baptism in its salutary effect, it saves by
water, as that does by leading to the resurrection of Christ; it saves
not as a cause, but as a means of directing to Christ, the author of
salvation; and saves not all in the water, only those that are in the
ark, that is, truly and rightly in the church, and real members of it,
or that are in Christ; and so many make the ark also a type of Christ.

And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth,....
That there was such a flood of waters brought upon the earth, is
confirmed by the testimonies of Heathen writers of all nations; only
instead of Noah they put some person of great antiquity in their nation,
as the Chaldeans, Sisithrus or Xisuthrus; the Grecians and Romans,
Prometheus or Deucalion, or Ogyges. Josephus (z) says, all the writers
of the Barbarian or Heathen history make mention of the flood and of the
ark; and he produces the authorities of Berosus the Chaldean, and
Hieronymus the Egyptian, who wrote the Phoenician antiquities, and
Mnaseas, and many others, and Nicolaus of Damascus: and there are others
that Eusebius (a) makes mention of, as Melo, who wrote against the Jews,
yet speaks of the deluge, at which a man with his sons escaped; and
Abydenus the Assyrian, whose account agrees with this of Moses that
follows in many things; as do also what Lucian (b) and Ovid (c) have
wrote concerning it, excepting in the name of the person in whose time
it was: and not only the Egyptians had knowledge of the universal
deluge, as appears from the testimony of Plato, who says (d), that an
Egyptian priest related to Solon, out of their sacred books, the history
of it; and from various circumstances in the story of Osiris and Typhon,
which name they give to the sea, and in the Chaldee language signifies a
deluge; and here the Targum of Onkelos renders the word by "Tuphana";
and the Arabs to this day call the flood "Al-tufan"; but the Chinese
also frequently speak of the deluge (e); and even it is said the
Americans of Mexico and Peru had a tradition of it (f); and the Bramines
also (g), who say that 21,000 years ago the sea overwhelmed and drowned
the whole earth, excepting one great hill, far to the northward, called
"Biudd"; and that there fled thither one woman and seven men (whose
names they give, see [Gen 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#013).md) those
understanding out of their books that such a flood would come, and was
then actually coming, prepared against the same, and repaired thither;
to which place also went two of all sorts of creatures (see [Gen
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#019).md) herbs, trees, and grass, and of
everything that had life, to the number in all of 1,800,000 living
souls: this flood, they say, lasted one hundred and twenty years (see
[Gen 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003).md) five months and five days;
after which time all these creatures that were thus preserved descended
down again, and replenished the earth; but as for the seven men and
woman, only one of them came down with her, and dwelt at the foot of the
mountain.And this flood was not topical or national only, but general
and universal: it was brought "upon the earth", upon the whole earth, as
the following account shows; and by the Lord himself, it was not through
second causes, or the common course of things: and to show it possible
and certain, this form of expression is used, "behold, I, even I, do
bring"; it was wonderful, beyond the power of nature, and therefore a
"behold" is prefixed; it was possible, because the Almighty God declares
he would bring it; and it was certain, which the redoubling of the word
points at; and would be quickly, since he said, "I am bringing", or "do
bring"; just about to do it; wherefore the ark was not so long preparing
as some have thought, and the command to build it was not long before
the flood came. The word for the flood comes from one which signifies to
fall (h), either because of the fall of the waters at it, or because it
made all things to fall, wither, and decay, as herbs, plants, men,
beasts, and all creatures; or from one that signifies to consume, or to
mix and confound, and bring all things to confusion, as Jarchi suggests
(i): and the end and intention of it, as here expressed, was

to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven;
every living creature, men and women, the beasts and cattle of the
earth, and every creeping thing on it, and the fowls of the heaven, man
principally, and these for his sake.

And everything that is in the earth shall die; but not what was in the
waters, the fishes of the sea, which could live in the flood.

But with thee will I establish my covenant,.... Made with Noah at this
time, though not expressed, that on his making an ark, as God directed
him, and going into it at his command, he would preserve him while
building it from the rage of wicked men, and save him in it and his
family, when the flood should come; and that they should come safe out
of it, and repeople the world, which should be no more destroyed by one;
for this covenant respects that later mentioned, [Gen
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#011.md) so Aben Ezra; or the promise of
the Messiah, which should spring from him, for the fulfilment of which
Noah and his family were spared; and this in every article God would
confirm, of which he might be assured from his power, veracity, and
faithfulness, and other perfections of his:

and thou shalt come into the ark; when the covenant would begin more
clearly to be established, and more plainly to be fulfilling; Noah on
the one hand being obedient to the divine will, having built an ark, and
entering into it; and on the other, God giving him leave, and an order
to enter into it, and shutting him up in it to preserve him:

thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee; that is,
Noah and his wife, and his sons and their wives, in all eight persons;
and eight only, as the Apostle Peter observes, [Pe1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020.md) by this it appears that Noah's
three sons were married before the flood, but as yet had no children.
Jarchi concludes, from the mode of expression used, that the men and
women were to be separate; that they entered the ark in this manner, and
continued so, the use of the marriage bed being forbidden them while in
the ark.

And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou
bring into the ark,.... That is, of fowls, cattle, and creeping things,
as after explained; and two of each sort at least were to be brought, as
Jarchi observes, and not fewer; though of the clean sort there were to
be more, even seven, as after directed; and these were to be brought,
that they might preserve their species, as it follows:

to keep them alive with thee; to be fed and nourished by him in the ark,
while others perished by the flood, that so they might propagate their
own species, and be continued, for which reason it is further ordered:

they shall be male and female; not any two, but one male and one female,
for the end before mentioned.

[Genesis 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 6:20</span></span>

Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every
creeping thing of the earth after his kind,.... What before is generally
expressed by "every living thing", is here particularly explained of
every sort of them; and from the order of them some have thought that in
the same manner they were disposed of in the ark, the fowls in the first
story, the cattle in the next, and the creeping things in the lowermost:
but others place them in a different manner; see Gill on [Gen
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#016.md) the roots and grain in the lower
story, the living creatures of all sorts in the second, and their hay
and litter in the third: the second story being three hundred cubits
long, and fifty broad, contained in the whole fifteen thousand cubits,
which is supposed to be divided into an hundred and fifty equal rooms;
so the Targum of Jonathan on [Gen 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014.md)
of these, four are allowed for Noah and his family, two with earth for
those animals that live underground, one for those which live on herbs
and roots, and the other for those which live on flesh; and the other
one hundred and forty four rooms are divided into three parts, that is,
twenty four for birds, twenty five for beasts, and the other ninety five
for such animals as are designed to be food for the rest; and according
to the calculations of learned men, there appear to have been in this
story rooms sufficient for all sorts of birds, beasts, and creeping
things (k):

two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive; that is,
they shall come of themselves, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra observe, the
providence of God so directing and impelling them, just as the creatures
came to Adam; so that there was no need for Noah to take any pains by
hunting or hawking to get such a number together: the Targum of Jonathan
is,"they shall come unto thee by the hand of an angel, who shall take
and cause them to come.''So says another Jewish (l) writer, that they
were collected by the angels who presided over each species; in which,
except the notion of angels presiding over every kind of creature, there
is no incongruity, as Bishop Patrick observes; and two of every sort
were to come to the ark, to be preserved alive there, that they might
propagate their species. So Lucian says (m), that swine, and horses, and
lions, and serpents, and all other creatures which were on the earth,
entered into the ark "by pairs".

Thus did Noah,.... Or "and" or "therefore Noah made" (o) the ark; and
"all things", as the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions:

according to all that God commanded him, so did he; he made the ark
according to the pattern God gave him, he gathered together food for
himself and family, and for all the creatures, and laid it up in the ark
as God directed him; and when the time was come, he and they not only
entered into it, but he took with him all the creatures he was ordered,
as after related; in this we have an instance of his fear of God, of his
faith in his word, and of his obedience to his will, see [Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md) in all which he was a type of
Christ, the builder of his church the ark was a figure of, and the pilot
of it through the tempestuous sea of this world, and the provider of all
good things for it, for the sustenance of it, and of those who are in
it.
