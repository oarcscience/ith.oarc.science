INTRODUCTION TO EXODUS 26

In this chapter a description is given of the tabernacle itself, and
first of its inward curtains, of their number, matter, length, and
breadth, and the manner of coupling them together, [Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md), and then of the outward curtains
of it, their number, matter, length, and breadth, and coupling, and how
disposed of, [Exo 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007.md), and next of
the two coverings of the tabernacle, of rams' skins and badgers' skins,
[Exo 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#014.md), the boards for the
tabernacle are also described, with their tenons and sockets, [Exo
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015.md) and the bars and rings for it,
by which it was kept firm together, [Exo
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#026.md), an account is given of the vail
between the holy and the most holy place, [Exo
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md), and of the hanging for the door
of the tabernacle, [Exo 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036.md).

[Exodus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 26:1</span></span>

Moreover, thou shalt make the tabernacle,.... Which he was ordered to
make before, the pattern of which was shown him in the mount: this was
an habitation for God to dwell in, as the word properly signifies, and
into which the furniture before described was to be put; this tabernacle
was a type both of the human nature of Christ, which is the true
tabernacle which God pitched, and not man, the greater and more perfect
one, [Heb 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002.md) in which the fulness of
the Godhead dwells bodily, where the glory of God is seen, in whom he
grants his gracious presence to his people, and accepts of them and
their sacrifices of prayer and praise; and also of the church of God,
[Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md). Here Jehovah dwells, grants
his presence to his people, and comes and blesses them; here he is
worshipped, and spiritual sacrifices are offered up to him with
acceptance: the tabernacle of Moses was made

with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
scarlet; the ground of these curtains was fine linen, twined or doubled:
and the Jewish writers, as Maimonides, Ben Gersom, and others, say it
was six times doubled, the word "Shesh", here used, signifying six; and
this was interwoven with threads of yarn dyed blue, purple, and scarlet;
according to Jarchi, the threads of which this tapestry was made were
twenty four times doubled: he observes,"there were four sorts in every
thread, one thread of fine linen, and three of wool, and every thread
was doubled six times; lo, the four sorts, when they were twined
together, there were twenty four double to a thread;''which if so, must
make a stuff of a very great consistence and stiffness. This, as applied
to the human nature of Christ, the fine linen may denote the purity of
it; the various colours the different graces of the Spirit, with which
it is adorned; or else the wounds, bruises, bloodshed, sufferings and
death he endured in it: as applied to the church, may signify the
clothing of the saints with the righteousness of Christ, that fine linen
clean and white, and their being washed in his precious blood, and
beautified with the graces of his Spirit:

with cherubim of cunning work shall thou make them; that is, with
figures like those of the cherubim on the mercy seat, so disposed by the
curious art and contrivance of the weaver, as to appear on both sides of
this tapestry; for this was not wrought by a needle, which only shows
the figure on one side, but by weaving, as Jarchi observes; and who
says, that there was one figure on one side, and another on another; as,
for instance, a lion on one side, and an eagle on the other; or, which
is more likely, the same figure was seen on both sides, as Maimonides
affirms, who says (e), the work called Chosheb (which is what is here
spoken of) is that whose figures appear on both sides, before and
behind: this in the mystical sense may point either to the ministration
of angels to Christ in his human nature, and to his people the heirs of
salvation; or else to the service of Gospel ministers, done for the
honour and glory of Christ, and the good of his church and people:
Josephus (f) thinks these curtains had a mystical meaning in them, and
represent the nature of the elements, and so Philo (g).

[Exodus 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 26:2</span></span>

The length of one curtain shall be twenty eight cubits,.... Or fourteen
yards:

and the breadth of one curtain four cubits; or two yards; according to
the common notion of a cubit being half a yard; but if, as Dr.
Cumberland says, the Jewish and Egyptian cubit was three inches longer,
this will make a considerable difference in the length and breadth of
those curtains, especially in the former:

and everyone of the curtains shall have one measure; be of equal length
and breadth.

[Exodus 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 26:3</span></span>

The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another,.... Five of
the ten curtains were to be sewed together, and make as it were one
curtain:

and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another: the other five
were to be joined together in like manner, and so made two large pieces
of tapestry of fourteen yards long and ten broad, according to the
common account of a cubit, but were much longer and broader.

[Exodus 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 26:4</span></span>

And thou shall make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain,....
The first large curtain, consisting of five sewed together, at the edge
of that:

from the selvedge in the coupling; where it was to be coupled with the
other great curtain; "loops" or "eyelet holes" (h), were to be made:
these were not wove with the curtains, for they were not to be upon all
of them, only at the two outermost of the largest ones, and therefore
were made afterwards, probably with the needle:

and likewise shall thou make in the uppermost edge of another curtain,
in the coupling of the second; loops also were to be made on the
outermost edge of another curtain belonging to the second great curtain,
where it was to be coupled with the first.

\(h\) "ocellos", Vatablus.

[Exodus 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 26:5</span></span>

Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain,.... In the first great
curtain, or in the outermost of the five that were sewed together:

and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in
the coupling of the second; as many also were to be made in the
outermost of the second great curtain where it was to be coupled with
the first:

that the loops may take hold one of another; or rather that they might
answer to one another in both curtains; for the loops could not take
hold of one another, only were made to meet together by the taches,
hooks, or clasps put into them, next mentioned.

[Exodus 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 26:6</span></span>

And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold,.... Which some render
"buttons" (i), others "hooks" (k) they seem to be "clasps"; the use of
them follows:

and couple the curtains together with the taches; the two great curtains
were made out of the ten, which had in them fifty(i) "fibulas", Tigurine
version, Vatablus (k) "Uncinos", Pagninus, Montanus, Drusius; so the
Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan.

[Exodus 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 26:7</span></span>

And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair,.... Jarchi calls it the
flower or down of goats, the softer and finer part of their hair, which
was spun by women, as appears from [Exo
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#026.md), and was made up into a stuff
somewhat like our camelot; these curtains were coarser than the former,
and were made to be put over them, to preserve them from the weather, as
it follows:

to be a covering upon the tabernacle: which, by the curtains of linen
coupled together, became one tabernacle, as in the preceding verse: and
these curtains were to be a tent or covering over them: they were
somewhat like, being made of the same matter, with the coverings with
which the ancient Arabs covered their tents, which were made of goats'
hair, as were the tents of Kedar alluded to in [Sol
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md), these curtains of goats' hair
denote the outward appearance of Christ in human nature, who, attended
with all human infirmities, excepting sin, was in the form of a servant,
in great meanness and poverty, covered with reproach, and had in the
greatest contempt, and especially at the time of his sufferings and
death; though all rich and glorious within, full of grace, and of all
the blessings of grace, of righteousness and life, of light, joy, peace,
and comfort for his people; and may also denote the mean appearance of
the church and people of God outwardly; being, generally speaking, a
poor and an afflicted people, subject to the scorn, reproach, and
persecutions of men, but all glorious within, enriched with the grace of
God and righteousness of Christ; and so, in one respect, like these
curtains of goats' hair, and, in another respect, like the curtains of
fine linen:

eleven curtains shalt thou make; one more than the other; the reason of
which was, that there might be one at the entrance of the tabernacle,
there being no linen curtain there, see [Exo
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#009.md).

[Exodus 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 26:8</span></span>

The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of one
curtain four cubits,.... The breadth of them is the same with the linen
curtains, but the length of them two cubits more; the reason of which
was, that they might hang down lower on either side, and the better
preserve them from any injury:

and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure; as to length and
breadth.

[Exodus 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 26:9</span></span>

And thou shall couple five curtains by themselves,.... And make one
large curtain of them, as was ordered with respect to the linen
curtains:

and six curtains by themselves; as there were eleven of them, such a
division was made of five into one large curtain, and six into another;
and as that which had six in it would reach further than the other,
provision is made for the disposal and use of that as follows:

and shall double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle;
at the entrance of it, in the east end of it; the sixth curtain reaching
to that, and hanging down, was turned up, and so doubled, opposite the
door or entrance; and was, as Jarchi says, like a modest bride that
covers her face with a vail, which before this had no covering; for thus
it was, as Dr. Lightfoot (m) describes it, the holy place was ten yards
long, and the five curtains sewed together were just so broad, and so
they covered only the top and the sides, but hung not down at the end,
which was eastward--but the six (goat hair curtains) that lay east
reached to the end, covered the pillars whereon that vail hung, and they
hung half a curtain's breadth or a yard over the entrance.

[Exodus 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 26:10</span></span>

And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain, that is
outmost in the coupling,.... Just in like manner, and in the same place
where they were ordered to be put on the linen curtains, only these are
not said to be of blue, but perhaps were wrought with goats hair: and
fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second; these
loops were set on each of the curtains where the two large pieces were
to be coupled together.

[Exodus 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 26:11</span></span>

And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass,.... As these curtains were
coarser, and also the loops, so the taches, hooks, or clasps, were made
of meaner metal, but answered the purpose of joining and coupling
together full as well: and put the taches into the loops; one end of the
hook or clasp into the loop on one of the curtains, and the other end of
the hook or clasp into the loop on the other curtain answering to it:
and couple the tent together, that it may be one; that the tent or
covering over the tabernacle might be one, as the tabernacle by the like
means was, [Exo 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md).

[Exodus 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 26:12</span></span>

And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent,.... Of the
goat hair curtains, which were one more than the linen curtains:

the half curtain that remaineth; for the other half extended to the east
end of it, at the entrance of the tabernacle, and hung down and was
doubled there, and the other that remained is here disposed of:

shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle; the west end of it,
where was the holy of holies; or rather, as Dr. Lightfoot (n) describes
it, thus, it was when those curtains (of goats' hair) were laid upon the
other over the tabernacle; they were not laid as these brazen loops
(clasps it should be) did light just upon the golden ones over the vail,
but three quarters of a yard more westward, so that the five curtains
that went west did reach to the ground and half a curtain to spare, [Exo
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#012.md) the other six that lay east
reached to the end, covered the pillars whereon that vail hung, and they
hung half a curtain's breadth or a yard over the entrance.

[Exodus 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 26:13</span></span>

And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side o that which
remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent,.... The curtains of
the tent, or the goat hair curtains, were two cubits longer than the
other, and these are the two cubits, one on one side and the other on
the other, which remained, and by which they were longer than the linen
curtains:

it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle; the north and south
sides: on this side:

and on that side, to cover it; and as the above learned doctor observes
(o), their length of fifteen yards reached half a yard lower on either
side than the other curtains did, and yet they came not to the ground by
a quarter of a yard; so that the silver foundations (of which
afterwards) were always plain to be seen everywhere but at the west end.

[Exodus 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 26:14</span></span>

And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,....
This was a covering that was put over the curtains of goats' skin; but
whether it went all over them, or only upon the roof of the tabernacle
they covered, to keep out the rains from soaking through, is not
certain, nor very evident; Jarchi thinks the roof was only covered with
this covering of rams' skins; but others think it more reasonable that
the whole was covered with them to preserve from dust and rain:

and a covering above of badgers' skins; of these skins See Gill on [Exo
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005.md), this was a fourth covering of
the tabernacle; the first was of linen curtains, the second of goats'
hair, the third of rams' skins, and the fourth of badgers' skins, which
seems to have been thicker and courser, since shoes were made of them,
[Eze 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#010.md), R. Judah, as quoted by
Jarchi, thinks the two last were but one covering, half of it consisting
of rams' skins and half of it of badgers' skins; but the text is express
that the latter was a covering above and over the former: these several
coverings of the tabernacle show the care that God takes of his church
and people, and how sufficiently they are provided for, that they may be
in safety from all their enemies, being clothed with Christ's
righteousness, and under the purple covering of his blood, and
surrounded by his almighty power, see [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md).

[Exodus 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 26:15</span></span>

And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle,.... Which were the
pillars and supports, and properly the walls of it, which gave it its
firmness and security, or otherwise the curtains would have been blown
about by every wind: they were to be made

of shittim wood standing up; just as they grew, as a Jewish writer
observes (p); these planks or boards were not to be laid along the
lengthways of them, but to be set upright; and may denote such who are
pillars in the house of God, and are to be upright both in heart and
conversation, both ministers and private members; and indeed the church
itself is the pillar and ground of truth, [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md).

Ten cubits shall be the length of a board,.... Or five yards, according
to the common cubit:

and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board; or three
quarters of a yard; and from hence we may learn what were the height and
the length of the tabernacle; according to the common computation of a
cubit, it was but five yards high and fifteen long, since there were but
twenty boards on each side, [Exo
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#018.md), but if three inches are added
to each cubit, it will make its measures considerably larger: Josephus
(q) says the boards were four fingers thick: according to Bishop
Cumberland the boards of the tabernacle, containing fifteen Jewish
square cubits, were very near fifty English square feet in their length
and breadth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 26:17</span></span>

Two tenons shall there be on one board,.... Every board was to be so cut
and shaped at the lower end of it, as to have, as it were, "two hands"
(r), as in the original, to enter into, lay hold on, and fasten in
mortises:

set in order one against another; at a proper distance from each other,
as the rounds of a ladder:

thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle; everyone was
to have two tenons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 26:18</span></span>

And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle,.... As in the manner
before described, so in number as follows:

twenty boards on the south side southward; which being a cubit and a
half broad, made the length of the tabernacle fifteen yards according to
the common account; but if these were cubits of twenty one inches, then
its length was much greater.

[Exodus 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 26:19</span></span>

And thou shall make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards,....
Or bases (s), and which were properly the foundation of the tabernacle,
on which it was settled and established; these sockets were the mortises
for the two tenons of each board or plank to be placed in, and were as
broad as the plank, and, joining each other, made one entire basis for
the whole structure; each socket contained a talent of silver, and was
made of the silver given at the numbering of the people, [Exo
38:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#025.md), and a talent of silver,
according to Bishop Cumberland, amounted to three hundred and fifty
three pounds, eleven shillings and some odd pence of our money: by which
may be judged the whole value of this silver foundation, which, with the
four sockets of the vail, consisted of one hundred of them, which answer
to the one hundred talents of silver collected at the above offering:

two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under
another board for his two tenons; and so in all the twenty boards, which
took up the whole forty on the south side.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 26:20</span></span>

And for the second side of the tabernacle the north side,.... The
direction of the tabernacle was east and west; at the east end was the
entrance into the holy place, and at the west end the holy of holies;
and the two sides were north and south; and as on the south side, so on
the north

there shall be twenty boards: just the same number as the laws of
building required.

[Exodus 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 26:21</span></span>

And their forty sockets of silver,.... answerable to the twenty boards,
for their two tenons to be placed in as in mortises: two sockets under
one board, and two sockets under another board; and so under all the
boards on the north side as on the south.

[Exodus 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 26:22</span></span>

And for the sides of the tabernacle,.... Or the ends of it, the east and
west, and the account begins with the west:

westward thou shalt make six boards; so that the breadth of the
tabernacle was but nine cubits, or four yards and a half, according to a
common cubit; but two boards more placed at the two corners of the
sides, next observed, added to the breadth of it.

[Exodus 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 26:23</span></span>

And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the
two sides. For the northwest and southwest corners, in the north and
south sides; concerning which Dr. Lightfoot thus writes (t): and the
west end had six planks entire, besides a plank at either corner,
joining end and sides together; these corner planks were of the same
breadth that all the others were, and, thus set, the middle of the
breadth of the one plank was laid close to the end of the south side, or
to that plank that was furthest west; so that a quarter of a yard of the
breadth of the corner plank was inward, to make up the tabernacle
breadth, a quarter was taken up with the thickness of the side plank to
which it joined, and a quarter lay outward: thus at the southwest, just
so was it at the northwest corner: then count; the two corner planks
were inward a quarter of a yard apiece, and the six planks that stood
between them of three quarters apiece, behold five yards, just the
breadth of the house between wall and wall: these corners knit end and
side together, and were the strength of the building; as, adds
he,"Christ is of his church, making Jews and Gentiles one spiritual
temple.''

[Exodus 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 26:24</span></span>

And they shall be coupled together beneath,.... At the bottom of the
boards or planks:

and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring at
the top of the boards there was a ring, to which they were coupled and
fastened, and so at the bottom of them, though not expressed: some
understand this of all the planks, both at the two sides and at the west
end; but it seems rather to respect only the corner planks, since it
follows:

thus shall it be for them both, they shall be for the two corners; which
were coupled and joined alike at each corner as if they were twins, as
the word used signifies; or the meaning is, that these were double
boards, and so like twins, which were so closely put together that they
seemed but one board; which was done that the corners might be thicker
and stronger, and so for the greater firmness of the building.

[Exodus 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 26:25</span></span>

And they shall be eight boards,.... Six at the west end and one at each
corner, northwest and southwest:

and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets the same as those for the
boards on both sides north and south: they were of the same metal,
silver; and they were two under one board, to receive its two tenons as
follows:

two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board; and so
under all eight, and which sockets joining with those of the two sides,
and in all made ninety six, were the basis and foundation of the
tabernacle, and was a figure of Christ, the only foundation of his
church and people; and the several tenons of the boards joined into
those sockets of silver may denote the union of the members of Christ
and ministers of his word to him, and their dependence on him.

[Exodus 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 26:26</span></span>

And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood, Which being put into rings or
staples of gold, kept the boards tight, close, and firm together:

five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle: for instance, the
south side; four of these were placed, two at the upper end of the
boards, and two at the lower end, and the fifth in the middle,
particularly taken notice of, [Exo
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#028.md), how long these bars were it is
not said, but it is reasonable to conclude that they reached the length
of the tabernacle, which was thirty cubits; and as it was not easy to
get bars of such a length, the notion of Josephus (u) perhaps, may be
right, that each two consisted of divers parts which joined one another,
the head of one entering into the hollow of the other and as he supposes
they were five cubits long, a row of them must have six parts, which
went along the sides, north and south, and the west end two, which was
but ten cubits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 26:27</span></span>

And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle,....
Suppose the north, these bars were disposed of in the same manner as
those on the south side:

and five bars for the boards of that side of the tabernacle; or the end
of it, the west end, as follows:

for the two sides westward; that is, the two corners at the west end,
the southwest and the northwest corners; and these five bars reached
from the one to the other, two at the upper part of the boards, and two
at the lower part, and one in the middle.

[Exodus 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 26:28</span></span>

And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to
end. From east to west, as Jarchi interprets it; but this can only be
said of the middle bar on the north and south sides of the tabernacle,
for the middle bar at the west end was north to south: about this bar
there is some difficulty, as that it is said to be "from end to end", as
if that only was; whereas it is reasonable to suppose that the rest were
so likewise; it may be, they might come somewhat short of reaching the
end, whereas this did entirely; or rather the truer reason is, because
the rest of the bars consisted of various parts; whereas this was a long
bar of one entire piece, reaching from one end of the tabernacle to the
other: likewise it is said to be "in the midst of the boards"; and the
Jewish writers are generally of opinion, that it did not run along in
rings as the other bars did, but the boards and planks being bored, this
went through the thickness of the wood throughout; and in this they are
followed by Arias Moatanus, Vatablus, Dr. Lightfoot, and others: but to
this it may be objected, that the boards must be very thick indeed, even
incredibly so, to admit of such a bore as to let in a bar of this kind,
and is not so consistent with its being a portable house; and besides,
when it was at any time taken down, in order to be removed, such a bar
must give a great deal of trouble, and be in danger of being broke to
pieces; besides, if it was thus covered in the boards, as it must be,
what need was there that it should be overlaid with gold, as in the next
verse? it is more probable, therefore, that it went not through the
midst of the thickness of the wood, but in the middle of the length of
the planks, and so expresses its different situation from the rest of
the bars, which were at or towards the top and bottom of the planks, and
this in the middle of them. It is not said of these bars, whether they
were within or on the outside of the tabernacle; it is most likely they
were on the outside, as Josephus (w) says they were; since they would
not have made a good appearance within side, where they would have been
always seen by the priests within, whereas being without they were
covered with the curtains.

[Exodus 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 26:29</span></span>

And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold,.... Not merely gild them,
but cover them with thin plates of gold; and which, because it would
take up a great quantity of gold, and make the boards very heavy, unless
the plates were very thin, when they were taken down and carried from
place to place, some have thought they were only glided:

and make their rings of gold, for places for the bars; these were made
of solid gold, and were as staples to let the bars into: and, according
to Jarchi, there were two rings to every board:

and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold: cover them with plates of
gold; and these bars and staples of gold show how compact and firm the
church of God is, through his almighty power, as well as how glorious
and splendid it is by his grace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 26:30</span></span>

And thou shall rear up the tabernacle,.... When thus finished, and all
the furniture belonging to it completed:

according to the fashion thereof, which was showed thee in the mount;
this is the third time that this is observed to Moses in the account of
the tabernacle; which shows how punctually God would have the pattern
observed he had given him, and that all things might be particularly and
exactly done according to it, see [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 26:31</span></span>

And thou shalt make a vail,.... The use of this, as follows, was to
divide the holy place from the most holy place in the tabernacle; it has
its name from hardness, it being very stiff and strong, for it was made
of thread six times doubled, and was four fingers thick, as the Jewish
writers say: this vail may represent the sin of man, which separates
between God and man, was removed by the death of Christ when the vail
was rent, and so the way to heaven opened; or the obscurity of the legal
dispensation, the Gospel being veiled under the shadows of the law, and
the way into the holiest of all then not so manifest, and particularly
the ceremonial law, which separated between Jew and Gentile, and is now
abolished by the death of Christ; or rather it was typical of the human
nature of Christ, his flesh, called in allusion to it the vail of his
flesh, [Heb 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020.md). This vail was made
of

blue, and purple, and scarlet, of fine twined linen of cunning work; it
seems to have been made of the same materials, and in the same curious
manner of workmanship with the curtains of the tabernacle, [Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md), and was itself no other than a
curtain, and so it is interpreted by some Jewish writers (x). It being
made of "fine linen" denotes the purity of Christ, of his nature, life,
and righteousness; of "twined linen", his strength, courage and
steadiness; "of blue, purple, and scarlet", the several graces of the
Spirit, with which his human nature was adorned, his flaming zeal for
his Father's glory and the good of his people, his bloody wounds,
sufferings, and death, the preciousness of his blood, the dignity of his
person, and his glorious exaltation, purple and scarlet being the
colours wore by kings:

with cherubim shall it be made; signifying either the ministration of
angels to him in his incarnate state, or the mission of Gospel ministers
by him, see [Psa 139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 26:32</span></span>

And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood, overlaid with
gold,.... For it was ten cubits long, and as many broad; and being of
such a stiffness and thickness as it was, required so many pillars to
support it: these pillars may signify the deity of Christ, which is the
support of his human nature, and in which it has its personal
subsistence, and gives all its actions and sufferings virtue and
efficacy; and being of "shittim wood", which is incorruptible, may
denote his eternity, and being covered with gold, his glory:

their hooks shall be of gold; which were upon the tops of the pillars on
which the vail was hung: and the pillars were

upon the four sockets of silver; which were properly the pedestals or
feet of the pillars; and these sockets, into which the pillars were let
and placed, and the hooks the vail hung by, may hint to the union of the
two natures in Christ, who is God and man in one person, God manifest in
the flesh; see [Sol 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015.md).

[Exodus 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">exo 26:33</span></span>

And thou shall hang up the vail under the taches,.... Or clasps, which
coupled the two grand curtains, or pieces of tapestry, each consisting
of five curtains, of which the tabernacle was made, [Exo
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md), and by this it seems that the
place where they met, and were clasped, was where the vail was hung
between the holy and the most holy place: for, as Dr. Lightfoot (y)
observes, according to the division of the house was the division of the
curtains, the vail that parted the holy from the most holy was hung just
under the golden clasps that knit the five curtains together; so that
five curtains lay over the holy place, and the other five over the most
holy; but with this difference, the holy place was ten yards long, and
the five curtains sewed together were just so broad, and so they covered
only the top and sides, but hung not down at the end which was eastward;
but the most holy was but five yards long, and the five curtains over
that did not only cover the top, but also hung down at the west end to
the silver bases; and of what he says of the goat hair curtains, and
their brazen clasps or taches, and where they met, and what they
covered; see Gill on [Exo 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#012.md),

that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the
testimony; the ark in which the testimony or law of God, testifying his
will, was put; of which see [Exo
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010.md), &c. this was to be set in the
most holy place, as being holy, spiritual, just, and good; and as being
fulfilled by Christ, signified by the ark in which it was, through whose
righteousness alone there is admission into the holy of holies, by which
this law is fulfilled, magnified, and made honourable:

and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most
holy; which was so thick, that there was no seeing through it; and none
might enter by it into the holiest of all but the high priest, and he
only on the day of atonement; and into the holy place might none come
but the priests, to do the service of the sanctuary. The holy place was
typical of the church on earth, where all the saints, who are priests to
God, worship, and the most holy of heaven, the perfect state of bliss
and happiness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 26:34</span></span>

And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon ark of the testimony,.... With
the cherubim of glory overshadowing it; all which were a representation
of the way of man's salvation flowing from the mercy and grace of God,
through the propitiation by Christ, and his perfect righteousness, by
which the law is fulfilled; and all this is published in the Gospel by
the ministers of it, signified by the cherubim: and these are all the
things that were "in the most holy place"; and they were placed at the
west end of it.

And thou shalt set the table without the vail,.... The table of
shewbread, of which see [Exo 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023.md),
this was not to be within the vail, but without it, in the holy place:
and the candlestick opposite the table, of which see [Exo
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md), &c. signifying, that in the
church of God, in the present state of things, which the holy place was
an emblem of, there are both food and light: the candlestick was placed

on the side of the tabernacle, toward the south; according to Jarchi,
two cubits and a half from the side of it:

and thou shalt put the table on the north side; of the tabernacle,
directly opposite the candlestick, two cubits and a half from the south
side, as the same writer says;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">exo 26:36</span></span>

And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent,.... At the east
end of the tabernacle, which lay open and exposed, and for which as yet
there was no provision; the west end of it, where stood the holy of
holies, was enclosed with six boards, and two corner ones, [Exo
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#022.md) and the linen curtains hung down
there to the silver bases, and so did the curtains of goats' hair, even
to the ground, and half a curtain to spare, see [Exo
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#012.md) but for the east end, or
entrance into the tabernacle, there was nothing till now ordered, only
the sixth curtain of the goats' hair curtains was there turned up
double, [Exo 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#009.md), but now here an
"hanging" is ordered, or rather a "covering" (z), as the word signifies;
Jarchi calls it a vail; and this was instead of a door to the
tabernacle, and divided the holy place, into which only the priests
might enter, from the place where the people stood and worshipped: and
this also was made

of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as was the vail
between the holy and the holy of holies; only with this difference, this
was

wrought with needle work, and that was of "cunning work": the difference
between these two, "Rokem" and "Chosheb", was, as Ben Melech from the
Misnah relates, that "Rokem" is the work of a needle, and therefore but
one face or figure is seen, that is, it is only seen on one side; but
"Chosheb" is the work of a weaver, and therefore two faces or figures
are seen, that is, they are seen on both sides; and with this account
Maimonides agrees; see Gill on [Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md), besides this hanging, Josephus
(a) tells us there was another of linen, of the same size with this, and
which covered it, and preserved it from the weather, and which on
festival days was turned back, that the people might have a prospect of
the other; just as there were curtains of goats' hair to preserve the
linen ones.

And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood,....
One at each corner of the entrance into the tabernacle, and the other
three at a proper distance from each other, so as to make four ways for
the priests to enter in at; as there might very well be, since there was
a breadth of ten cubits, or five yards or more:

and overlay them with gold; with plates of gold, for a gild would soon
wear off by continual use in passing and repassing. This is to be
understood not of the whole pillars, but of the chapiters, heads, tops,
or knobs of them, and of their fillets or girdles; in some parts of them
the wood appearing, as is plain from [Exo
36:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#038.md),

and their hooks shall be of gold; on which the hanging, covering, or
vail was hung:

and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them; for the pillars to
stand upon them, and were of a meaner metal than those on which the
pillars for the vail before mentioned; that being the entrance into the
holy of holies, where the divine Majesty dwelt, this into the holy place
where the priests did their service.
