INTRODUCTION TO JAMES 4

In this chapter the apostle gives the true cause of contentions and
strifes; and cautions against intemperance, covetousness, pride,
detraction, and vain confidence. Having, in the latter part of the
preceding chapter, inveighed against strife and contention, he here
shows from whence they spring, from a covetous desire of riches and
honour; and which yet are not obtained, because they did not ask these
things of God with submission to his will; or they asked with a wrong
view, namely, to gratify their lusts, [Jam
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md) and he dissuades from such
unlawful desires, partly because they were no other than adultery; and
partly because indulging them was declaring themselves enemies of God,
[Jam 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md) and he deters from pride,
under the name of envy, proud men being generally envious; from the
sense of the Scripture, which says, not in vain, that the spirit lusts
unto it; and from the consequence of it, such as are proud being
resisted by the Lord, when he gives more grace to humble ones, [Jam
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005.md) hence follow several exhortations,
and various duties relating to humility; as to submit to God, and resist
the devil, encouraged thereunto by this motive, he will flee, [Jam
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md), to draw nigh to God in a way of
religious worship, who will draw nigh in a way of grace to his people;
to purity of action, and of heart, or to that which is outward and
inward, [Jam 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md) to be humbled, mourn,
and weep, instead of joy and laughter, [Jam
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009.md) to lie low before the Lord, who
will raise such up, [Jam 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#010.md) and not
to speak evil of anyone, since this is judging a brother; nay, a
speaking evil of the law, and a judging of that; which is to invade the
prerogative of God, the lawgiver, who is able to save, and to destroy;
and therefore one man should not take upon him to judge another, [Jam
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011.md) and as another instance of great
neglect of God, and his providence, and disrespect unto it, the apostle
takes notice of a common practice among men, and even professors of
religion, who resolve to go to such a place, and continue so long, and
there make merchandise, and promise themselves success; not considering
what frail short lived creatures they are, and how much all depends upon
the will of God; and which they should consider, submit to, and be
determined by, [Jam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013.md) and he
reproves them for their boastings and joy in them, as evil, [Jam
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016.md), and observes, that it is not
enough to know what is right and good, unless it is done; and that such
knowledge is but an aggravation of the evil of sin committed, [Jam
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017.md).

[James 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 4:1</span></span>

From whence come wars and fightings among you?.... Which are to be
understood, not of public and national wars, such as might be between
the Jews and other nations at this time; for the apostle is not writing
to the Jews in Judea, as a nation, or body politic, but to the twelve
tribes scattered abroad, and to such of them as were Christians; nor
were Christians in general as yet increased, and become such large
bodies, or were whole nations become Christians, and much less at war
one against another, which has been the case since; and which, when it
is, generally speaking arises from a lust after an increase of power;
from the pride and ambitious views of men, and their envy at the
happiness of other princes and states: nor do these design theological
debates and disputes, or contentions about religious principles; but
rather lawsuits, commenced before Heathen magistrates, by the rich, to
the oppression of the poor; see [Jam
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#006.md) though it seems best of all to
interpret them of those stirs and bustlings, strifes, contentions, and
quarrels, about honours and riches; endeavouring to get them by unlawful
methods, at least at the expense of their own peace, and that of others:

come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? as
pride, envy, covetousness, ambition, &c. which, like so many soldiers,
are stationed and quartered in the members of the body, and war against
the soul; for in the believer, or converted man, however, there is as it
were two armies; a law in the members, warring against the law of the
mind; the flesh against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh;
and from this inward war arise external ones; or at least from the
corruption of nature, which militates against all that is good, all
quarrels and contentions, whether public or private, of a greater or
lesser nature, and consequence, spring.

[James 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 4:2</span></span>

Ye lust, and have not,.... The apostle proceeds to show the
unsuccessfulness of many in their desires and pursuits after worldly
things; some might be like the sluggard, whose soul desireth all good
things, and yet he has nothing, [Pro
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004.md) because he does not make use of
any means, even of such as are proper and necessary, and ought to be
used:

ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain; some, instead of kill,
which seems not so agreeable, read envy; and then the sense is, they
envy at the good and happiness of others, and covet after another's
property, but cannot enjoy it; all such envy and covetousness are
fruitless, as well as sinful:

ye fight and war, yet ye have not; go to law one with another about each
other's property; or rather, make a great stir and hustle to get the
things of the world; rise early, and sit up late; strive who should get
most, and quarrel about what is gotten, and seek to get all advantages
of one another; and yet still have not, what at least is desired and
strove for:

because ye ask not; of God, whose blessing only makes rich: instead of
all this worldly stir and bustle, and these strivings and quarrellings
with one another, it would be much more advisable, and, in the issue, be
found to turn to more account, to pray to God for a blessing on your
endeavours; and to ask of him the good and necessary things of life, in
submission to his will, and with thankfulness for what he has bestowed.

[James 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 4:3</span></span>

Ye ask, and receive not,.... Some there were that did ask of God the
blessings of his goodness and providence, and yet these were not
bestowed on them; the reason was,

because ye ask amiss; not in the faith of a divine promise; nor with
thankfulness for past mercies; nor with submission to the will of God;
nor with a right end, to do good to others, and to make use of what
might be bestowed, for the honour of God, and the interest of Christ:
but

that ye may consume it upon your lusts; indulge to intemperance and
luxury; as the man that had much goods laid up for many years did, to
the neglect of his own soul, [Luk
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019.md) or the rich man, who spent all
upon his back and his belly, and took no notice of Lazarus at his gate;
[Luk 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md).

[James 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 4:4</span></span>

Ye adulterers and adulteresses,.... Not who were literally such, but in
a figurative and metaphorical sense: as he is an adulterer that removes
his affections from his own wife, and sets them upon another woman; and
she is an adulteress that loves not her husband, but places her love
upon another man; so such men and women are adulterers and adulteresses,
who, instead of loving God, whom they ought to love with all their
hearts and souls, set their affections upon the world, and the things of
it: the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, leave out the word
"adulteresses": these the apostle addresses in the following manner;

know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? that an
immoderate love for the good things of the world, and a prevailing
desire after the evil things of it, and a delight in the company and
conversation of the men of the world, and a conformity to, and
compliance with, the sinful manners and customs of the world, are so
many declarations of war with God, and acts of hostility upon him; and
show the enmity of the mind against him, and must be highly displeasing
to him, and resented by him:

whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God;
whoever is in league with the one must be an enemy to the other; God and
mammon cannot be loved and served by the same persons, at the same time;
the one will be loved, and the other hated; the one will be attended to,
and the other neglected: this may be known both from reason and from
Scripture, particularly from [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md).

[James 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 4:5</span></span>

Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain?.... Some think that the
apostle refers to a particular passage of Scripture in the Old
Testament, and that he took it from [Gen
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md) as some; or from [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md), as others; or from [Deu
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002.md) or from [Job
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#006.md) or from [Pro
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#010.md) others think he had in view some
text in the New Testament; either [Rom
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002.md) or [Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md) and some have imagined that he
refers to a passage in the apocryphal book:

"For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body
that is subject unto sin.'' (Wisdom 1:4)

and others have been of opinion that it is taken out of some book of
Scripture then extant, but now lost, which by no means can be allowed
of: the generality of interpreters, who suppose a particular text of
Scripture is referred to, fetch it from [Num
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#029.md) but it seems best of all to
conclude that the apostle has no regard to any one particular passage of
Scripture, in which the following words are expressly had, since no such
passage appears; but that his meaning is, the sense of the Scripture
everywhere, where it speaks of this matter, is to this purpose: nor does
it say this, or any thing else in vain; whatever is written there is to
answer some end, as for learning, edification, and comfort, for
doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness; neither
with respect to what is before suggested, that what is asked in a right
manner, and for a right end, shall be given; and that the love of the
world, and the love of God, are things incompatible; nor with respect to
what follows:

the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? that is, the depraved
spirit of man, the spirit of an unregenerate man; that as it is prone to
every lust, and prompts to every sin, the imagination of the thought of
man's heart being evil, and that continually, so it instigates to envy
the happiness of others; see [Gen 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md)
or this may be put as a distinct question from the other, "does the
spirit that dwelleth in us lust to envy?" that is, the Holy Spirit, who
dwells in the hearts of his people, as in his temple: the Ethiopic
version reads, "the Holy Spirit": and then the sense is, does he lust to
envy? no; he lusts against the flesh and the works of it, and envy among
the rest; see [Gal 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md) but he does
not lust to it, or provoke to it, or put persons upon it; nor does he,
as the Arabic version renders it, "desire that we should envy"; he is a
spirit of grace; he bestows grace and favours upon men; and is so far
from envying, or putting others upon envying any benefit enjoyed by men,
that he increases them, adds to them, and enlarges them, as follows.

[James 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 4:6</span></span>

But he giveth more grace,.... The Arabic version adds, "to us"; the
Ethiopic version, "to you"; and the Syriac version reads the whole thus;
"but our Lord gives more grace to us"; or "greater grace"; than the
world can give, whose friendship is courted by men; the least measure of
grace, of faith, and hope, and love, and of a spiritual knowledge of
Christ, and interest in him, and of peace, joy, and comfort, is more
worth than all the world, and everything in it: or greater grace, more
favours than the saints are able to ask or think; so Solomon had more
favours given him than he could think of asking for: or greater grace,
and larger measures of it, even of spiritual light and knowledge, under
the Gospel dispensation, than under the former dispensation; or where
God bestows gifts qualifying for service and usefulness, and these are
made use of and employed for such purposes, he gives more: or this may
refer to internal grace wrought by the Spirit of God, in the hearts of
his people; more of which he may be said to give, when he causes it to
abound, as to its acts and exercises; when faith grows exceedingly, hope
revives, and is lively, and abounds through his power and influence, and
love to God and Christ, and one another, abounds yet more and more; when
there is a growth in every grace, and in the knowledge of Christ Jesus,
so that this grace becomes a well of living waters, springing up into
eternal life, which at last will have its perfection in glory:

wherefore he saith; either the Spirit that gives more grace, or the
Scripture, or God in the Scripture, in [Pro
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md),

God resisteth the proud: or scorns the scorners; he rejects them that
trust in themselves that they are righteous, and despise others; that
say, Stand by thyself, I am holier than thou; that are proud of
themselves, their enjoyments, their gifts, their external righteousness,
and holiness, and are full, and rich, and increased with goods, and
stand in need of nothing; these he opposes, he sets himself against, he
thrusts them away from him, he sends them away empty, and scatters them
in the imagination of their own hearts; and in the things in which they
deal proudly, he is above them; he sits in the heavens and laughs at
them, and frustrates all their schemes:

but he giveth grace unto the humble; who are sensible of their own
vileness and meanness, and acknowledge it; who think the meanest of
themselves, and the best of others; and do not envy the gifts and graces
of God bestowed upon others, but rejoice at them; and ascribe all they
have, and are, to the free grace of God; and ingenuously confess the
deficiency of their duties, and the insufficiency of their righteousness
to justify them before God; and that when they have done all they can,
or are assisted to do, they are but unprofitable servants: now to these
God gives grace; he not only gives grace at first, to make them humble,
but he gives them more grace, or increases what he gives: grace is God's
gift; he gives all the grace that is in Christ, and all the blessings of
grace that are in the covenant, and all the grace that is in the hearts
of his people; as faith, hope, love, repentance, humility, patience,
self-denial, resignation to his will, and every degree of spiritual
knowledge; and grace is only his gift; men cannot give it to themselves,
nor can the best of men give it to others; not godly parents to their
children; nor ministers to those to whom they preach; no, nor the angels
in heaven; nor is it to be obtained by the works of men: it is a free
gift; it is given of the sovereign will and good pleasure of God, to
whom, and when, and in what measure he pleases; to which he is not
induced by any motives in men, for they have nothing in them to move him
to it; and it is given by him absolutely, without conditions, not
suspending it till the performance of them; and he gives it cheerfully
and not grudgingly, largely, bountifully, and in great abundance.

[James 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 4:7</span></span>

To the will of God, with respect to worldly things, and be content with
such things as are enjoyed, and be satisfied with the portion that is
allotted; it is right and best for the people of God to leave themselves
with him, to choose their inheritance for them, since by all their
anxious cares, their striving and struggling, their impatient desires,
wars and fightings, as they cannot add one cubit to their stature, so
nothing to their worldly substance; and it becomes them to submit to God
in all afflictive dispensations of his providence, and be still and know
that he is God; as well as to submit to his way and method of salvation
by Christ, and particularly to the righteousness of Christ, for
justification; and to depend upon him for supplies of grace in the
discharge of every duty, and the exercise of every grace:

resist the devil, and he will flee from you; Satan is to be looked upon
as an enemy, and to be opposed as such, and to be watched and guarded
against; the whole armour of God should be taken and made use of,
particularly the weapon of prayer, the sword of the Spirit, which is the
word of God, and the shield of faith; and also the grace of humility,
than which nothing is more opposite to him: he is a proud spirit, and he
endeavours to swell men with pride of themselves; and when he has worked
them up to such a pitch, he is then master of them, and can manage them
as he pleases; but a poor humble believer, with whom God dwells, to whom
he gives more grace, and who comes forth not in his own strength, but in
the strength of the Lord God, as David against Goliath, and who owns his
vileness and sinfulness, and flies to the grace of God, and blood of
Christ, Satan knows not what to do with him, he is puzzled, baffled, and
confounded; such he leaves, from such he flees; he does not like the
power of prayer, nor the strength of faith, nor the sharpness of the
twoedged sword, the word of God, nor the humble believer's staff, bag,
scrip, and sling.

[James 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 4:8</span></span>

Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you,.... This must be
understood consistently with the perfection of God's immensity and
omnipresence: the saints draw nigh to God when they present their bodies
in his sanctuary; when they tread in his courts, and attend his
ordinances; where they always find it good for them to draw nigh unto
him; and blessed is the man that approaches to him in faith and fear:
they draw nigh to him when they come to the throne of his grace, for
grace and mercy to help them; when they draw near to him in prayer with
true hearts, and lift them up with their hands to God; when in the
exercise of faith and hope they enter within the vail, and come up even
to his seat; and lay hold on him as their covenant God and Father; and
he draws nigh to them by granting them his gracious presence, by
communicating his love to them, by applying the blessings of his grace,
by helping them in times of need and distress, and by protecting them
from their enemies; the contrary to which is expressed by standing afar
off from them. Now this is not to be understood as if men could first
draw nigh to God, before he draws nigh to them; for as God first loves,
so he first moves; he takes the first step, and, in conversion, turns
and draws men to himself; though this does not respect first conversion,
but after acts in consequence of it; nor is it to be considered as a
condition of the grace and favour of God, in drawing nigh to his people,
but is expressive of what is their duty, and an encouragement to it:

cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double
minded; the persons addressed are not the profane men of the world, but
sinners in Zion, formal professors, hypocritical persons; who speak with
a double tongue to men, and who draw nigh to God with their mouths, but
not with their hearts; who halt between two opinions, and are unstable
in all their ways: cleansing of their hands and hearts denotes the
purity of outward conversation, and of the inward affections; and
supposes impurity both of flesh and spirit, that the body and all its
members, the soul and all its powers and faculties, are unclean; and yet
not that men have a power to cleanse themselves, either from the filth
of an external conversation, or from inward pollution of the heart;
though a man attempts the one, he fails in it; and who can say he has
done the other? [Job 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030.md). This is not
to be done by ceremonial ablutions, moral services, or evangelical
ordinances; this is God's work only, as appears from his promises to
cleanse his people from their sins, by sprinkling clean water upon them;
from the end of Christ's shedding his blood, and the efficacy of it; and
from the prayers of the saints, that God would wash them thoroughly from
their iniquity, and cleanse them from their sin, and create clean hearts
in them: and yet such exhortations are not in vain, since they may be
useful to convince men of their pollution, who are pure in their own
eyes, as these hypocritical, nominal professors, might be; and to bring
them to a sense of their inability to cleanse themselves, and of the
necessity of being cleansed elsewhere; and to lead them to inquire after
the proper means of cleansing, and so to the fountain of Christ's blood,
which only cleanses from all sin.

[James 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 4:9</span></span>

Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep,.... Not in a bare external way; not
by afflicting the body with fastings and scourgings, by renting of
garments, and clothing with sackcloth, and putting ashes on the head,
and other such outward methods of humiliation; but afflicting the soul
is meant, an inward mourning and weeping over the plague of the heart,
the impurity of nature, and the various sins of life; after a godly
sort, and because contrary to a God of infinite love and grace; in an
evangelical way, looking to Jesus, and being affected with the pardoning
grace and love of God in Christ.

Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness;
meaning their carnal joy, on account of their friendship with the world,
and their enjoyment of the things of it, since they consumed them on
their lusts, and which betrayed enmity to God.

[James 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 4:10</span></span>

Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord,.... Which is done, when men,
before the Lord, and from their hearts, and in the sincerity of their
souls, acknowledge their meanness and unworthiness, their vileness,
sinfulness, and wretchedness, and implore the grace and mercy of God in
Christ, as did Abraham, Jacob, Job, Isaiah, Paul, and the publican; and
when they walk humbly with God, acknowledging they can do nothing
without him; owning their dependence on his grace, and ascribing all
they have, and are, unto it:

and he shall lift you up; this is God's usual way to lift up the meek,
and exalt those that humble themselves; he lifts them from the dunghill,
to set them among princes; he gives them a place, and a name in his
house, better than sons and daughters; he adorns them with his grace; he
clothes them with the righteousness of his Son, he grants them nearness
to himself; and at last will introduce them into his kingdom and glory.

[James 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 4:11</span></span>

Speak not evil one of another, brethren,.... The apostle here returns to
his former subject, concerning the vices of the tongue, he had been upon
in the preceding chapter, [Jam 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006.md),
and here mentions one, which professors of religion were too much guilty
of, and that is, speaking evil one of another; which is done either by
raising false reports, and bringing false charges; or by aggravating
failings and infirmities; or by lessening and depreciating characters,
and endeavouring to bring others into discredit and disesteem among men:
this is a very great evil, and what the men of the world do, and from
them it is expected; but for the saints to speak evil one of another, to
sit and speak against a brother, and slander an own mother's son, is
barbarous and unnatural.

He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh
evil of the law, and judgeth the law; he that is a talebearer and
backbites his brother, his fellow member, and detracts from his good
name and character, and takes upon him to judge his heart, and his
state, as well as, to condemn his actions, he speaks evil of the law;
and judges and condemns that, as if that forbid a thing that was lawful,
even tale bearing and detraction, [Lev
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#016.md), or by speaking evil of him for
a good thing he does, he blames and condemns the law, as though it
commanded a thing that was evil; and by passing sentence upon his
brother, he takes upon him the province of the law, which is to accuse,
charge, convince, pronounce guilty, and condemn:

but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law; as is a duty,
and would best become:

but a judge; and so such a person not only infringes the right of the
law, but assumes the place of the Judge and lawgiver himself; whereas,
as follows,

[James 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 4:12</span></span>

There is one lawgiver,.... The Alexandrian copy, and others, and the
Syriac, Ethiopic, and Vulgate Latin versions, add, "and judge". Who is
the one only Lord God, [Isa 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022.md).
This is a character that may be applied to God the Father, who gave the
law to the people of Israel, both the judicial and ceremonial law, and
also the moral law; from his right hand went a fiery law, and to him
belongs the giving of it; and also to the Son of God, the Lord Jesus who
is King of saints, and lawgiver in his house; who has given out
commandments to be observed, and laws of discipline for the right
ordering of his house, and kingdom, to be regarded; and particularly the
new commandment of love, which is eminently called the law of Christ;
and which is most apparently broke, by detraction and speaking evil one
of another: now there may be inferior and subordinate lawgivers, as
Judah is said to be God's lawgiver, and Moses is said to command the
Jews a law; yet there is but one supreme, universal, and perfect
lawgiver, who is God; and though there may be many lawgivers in things
political, whose legislative power is to be obeyed, both for the Lord's
sake, and for conscience sake; yet in things religious, and relating to
conscience, God is the only lawgiver, who is to be hearkened unto:

who is able to save, and to destroy; this is true of God the Father, who
is able to save, and does save by his Son Jesus Christ, and even persons
that have broken the law he has given, and are liable to the curse and
condemnation of it; and he is able to save them according to that law,
in perfect consistence with it, and with his justice and holiness, since
Christ, by whom he saves, was made under it, and has fulfilled it; and
that Christ is mighty to save, able to save to the uttermost, is certain
from the Scripture, and all experience; and God, the lawgiver, is able
to destroy both body and soul in hell, for the transgressions of his
law; and even Christ the Lamb is also the lion of the tribe of Judah,
who will break his enemies in pieces, as a potter's vessel, and punish
the contemners of his Gospel with everlasting destruction, from his
presence and glory: in a word, God, the lawgiver, is sovereign, and can
destroy, or save, whom he pleases; he is able to save the brother that
is spoken against, and to destroy him that speaks against him:

who art thou that judgest another? another man's servant, as in [Rom
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#004.md) or "thy neighbour", as the Syriac
and Ethiopic versions read; or "the neighbour", as the Alexandrian copy,
and the Vulgate Latin version; that is, any brother, friend, or
neighbour, in the manner as before observed in the preceding verse.

[James 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 4:13</span></span>

Go to now, ye that say,.... The apostle passes from exposing the sin of
detraction, and rash judgment, to inveigh against those of presumption
and self-confidence; and the phrase, "go to now", is a note of
transition, as well as of attention, and contains the form of a solemn
and grave address to persons, who either think within themselves, or
vocally express, the following words, or the like unto them:

today, or tomorrow, we will go into such a city; in such a country, a
place of great trade and merchandise; as Tyre then was in Phoenicia,
Thessalonica in Macedonia, Ephesus in Asia, and others: some render this
as an imperative, or as an exhortation, "let us go", which does not
alter the sense.

And continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain; as is
customary for merchants to do; nor does the apostle design by this to
condemn merchandise, and the lawful practice of buying and selling, and
getting gain; but that men should not resolve upon those things without
consulting God, and attending to his will, and subjecting themselves to
it; and without considering the uncertainty and frailty of human life;
as well as should not promise and assure themselves of success, of
getting gain and riches, as if those things were in their own power, and
had no dependence upon the providence and blessing of God.

[James 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 4:14</span></span>

Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow,.... Whether there would
be a morrow for them or not, whether they should live till tomorrow; and
if they should, they knew not what a morrow would bring forth, or what
things would happen, which might prevent their intended journey and
success: no man can secure a day, an hour, a moment, and much less a
year of continuance in this life; nor can he foresee what will befall
him today or tomorrow; therefore it is great stupidity to determine on
this, and the other, without the leave of God, in whom he lives, moves,
and has his being; and by whose providence all events are governed and
directed; see [Pro 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001.md)

for what is your life? of what kind and nature is it? what assurance can
be had of the continuance of it? by what may it be expressed? or to what
may it be compared?

it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth
away; which rises out of the earth, or water, and expires almost as soon
as it exists; at least, continues but a very short time, and is very
weak and fleeting, and carried about here and there, and soon returns
from whence it came: the allusion is to the breath of man, which is in
his nostrils, and who is not to be accounted of, or depended on.

[James 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 4:15</span></span>

For that ye ought to say,.... Instead of saying we will go to such and
such a place, and do this, and that, and the other thing, it should be
said,

if the Lord will, and we shall live, and do this and that; the last
"and" is left out in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic
versions; and the passage rendered thus, "if the Lord will, and we shall
live, we will do this": so that here are two conditions of doing
anything; the one is, if it should be agreeable to the determining will
and purpose of God, by which everything in the world comes to pass, and
into which the wills of men should be resolved, and resigned; and the
other is, if we should live, since life is so very uncertain and
precarious: and the sense is, not that this exact form of words should
be always used, but what is equivalent to them, or, at least, that there
should be always a sense of these things upon the mind; and there should
be a view to them in all resolutions, designs, and engagements: and
since the words are so short and comprehensive, it might be proper for
Christians to use themselves to such a way of speaking; upon all
occasions; we find it used by the Apostle Paul frequently, as in [Act
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md), and even by Jews, Heathens, and
Turks. It is a saying of Ben Syra, the Jew (p),

"let a man never say he will do anything, before he says , "if God
will"''

So Cyrus, king of Persia, when, under pretence of hunting, he designed
an expedition into Armenia, upon which an hare started, and was caught
by an eagle, said to his friends, this will be a good or prosperous
hunting to us, , "if God will" (q). And very remarkable are the words of
Socrates to Alcibiades, inquiring of him how he ought to speak; says
Socrates, , "if God will" (r); and says he, in another place (s),

"but I will do this, and come unto thee tomorrow, "if God will".''

And it is reported of the Turks (t), that they submit everything to the
divine will; as the success of war, or a journey, or anything, even of
the least moment, they desire to be done; and never promise themselves,
or others, anything, but under this condition, "In Shallah", if God
will.

Aleibiade, p. 135. (s) Plato in Laches. (t) Smith de Moribus Turc. p.

[James 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jam 4:16</span></span>

But now ye rejoice in your boastings,.... Of tomorrow, and of the
continuance of life, and of going to such a place, and abiding there for
such a time, and of trading and trafficking with great success, to the
obtaining of much gain and riches; see [Pro
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001.md)

all such rejoicing is evil; wicked and atheistical, as expressing a
neglect of and independence on Providence; arrogating and ascribing too
much to themselves, their power and will, as if they had their lives and
fortunes in their own hands, and at their own dispose, when all depend
upon the will of God. The Syriac version renders it, "all such rejoicing
is from evil"; from an evil heart, and from the evil one, Satan.

[James 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 4:17</span></span>

Therefore to him that knoweth to do good,.... This may regard not only
the last particular of referring all things to the will of God, the
sovereign disposer of life, and all events, which some might have the
knowledge of in theory, though they did not practise according to it;
but all the good things the apostle had exhorted to, and the contrary to
which he had warned from, in this epistle; and suggests, that a Gnostic,
or one that knows the will of God, in the several branches of it,
revealed in his word,

and doth it not, to him it is sin: it is a greater sin; it is an
aggravated one; it is criminal in him that is ignorant of what is good,
and does that which is evil, nor shall he escape punishment; but it is
much more wicked in a man that knows what is right and good, and ought
to be done, and does it not, but that which is evil, and his
condemnation will be greater; see [Luk
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047.md). The omission of a known duty,
as well as the commission of a known sin, is criminal.
