INTRODUCTION TO REVELATION 14

This chapter contains three visions; one of the Lamb on Mount Zion,
another of the three angels preaching against Babylon, and the third of
the harvest and vintage. The vision of the Lamb is in [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md), which is no other than Christ,
described by his similitude, as a Lamb; by the place where he was, Mount
Zion; by his position there, standing, and by the company that were with
him, whose number were 144,000, and their character, his Father's name
written on their foreheads; at the same time a voice was heard from
heaven, comparable to the sound of many waters, of thunders, and of
harps: and a song sung which none learn but the above number with the
Lamb, [Rev 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002.md), who are described by
their purity, chastity, and strict adherence to Christ; by their
redemption through him; by their being the firstfruits of God and of the
Lamb, and by their integrity and unblemished character, [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md); next follows the account of the
three angels; the first comes with the everlasting Gospel, to preach it
to all men, loudly calling upon all to fear and worship God, and give
glory to him, since he is the Creator of all, and the hour of his
judgment is come, [Rev 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md); the
second proclaims the fall of Babylon, with the reason of it, [Rev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md); and the third denounces the
wrath of God upon the worshippers of the beast in the most public
manner, and that for ever, [Rev 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009.md);
and this vision is closed with some expressions, showing that, till this
was done, the patience of the saints would be tried, and the true
worshippers of the Lamb be discovered, and comforting them with an
assurance of that rest that remains after death for the faithful
followers of Christ, [Rev 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#012.md); after
this is the vision of the harvest and vintage of the earth. The reaper
is described by his form, like the son of man; by his seat, a white
cloud; by a golden crown on his head, and by a sharp sickle in his hand,
[Rev 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014.md); who is called upon by an
angel out of the temple to make use of his sickle, and reap, because the
time of reaping was come, the harvest being ripe, [Rev
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015.md), upon which he thrusts in his
sickle, and reaps the earth, [Rev
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#016.md); after this, another angel
appears out of the temple, with a sharp sickle, to whom another angel
from the altar, that had power over fire, calls to make use of his
sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine, since the grapes were fully
ripe, [Rev 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#017.md); upon which he
thrusts in his sickle, and gathers them, and casts them into the
winepress of divine wrath, which being trodden, blood comes out of it to
the horses' bridles for the space of a thousand and six hundred
furlongs, [Rev 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#019.md).

[Revelation 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 14:1</span></span>

And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb,.... The Alexandrian copy, and some
others, read "the Lamb"; the same that had been seen before in, the
midst of the throne, [Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md); and all
the Oriental versions have the same article also; the Lord Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, for mention is made of his Father in a following clause;
the King of Zion, where he is seen standing, and the Redeemer of his
people, who are at large described; it is the same Lamb who is so often
spoken of in this book before: in the two preceding chapters an account
is given of the state of the church, as oppressed under Rome Pagan, and
Rome Papal, and here of its more glorious and victorious condition, with
Christ at the head of it; in the last chapter antichrist is described,
with his followers and worshippers, and as exercising tyranny and
cruelty upon the saints, and here Christ and his followers are
represented in vision, and some hints given of the fall of Babylon, and
of the wrath of God upon the worshippers of the beast, and of the
happiness of those who belong to the Lamb: and of him it is here said,
that he

stood on the Mount Zion; by which is meant not heaven, but the church on
earth; why that is called Mount Zion; see Gill on [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md); here Christ the Lamb stood, as
presiding over it, being King of Zion, or the church; where he stood and
fed, or ruled, in the name of the Lord, and in the majesty of his God;
and where he appeared in the defence of his church and people, oppressed
by antichrist; for he is Michael that standeth for the children of his
people, and who stands with courage, and in the greatness of his
strength, and is invincible; nor does he stand here alone:

and with him an hundred forty and four thousand; the same with those in
[Rev 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md), though all the world
wondered after the beast, and all that dwelt upon the earth worshipped
him, yet there was a number preserved that did not bow the knee to him;
a remnant according to the election of grace, who were called out of the
world, and brought to Zion, and were on the side of the Lamb, and abode
by him, and cleaved unto him:

having his Father's name written in their foreheads; not baptism,
administered in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost, as some think; nor eternal election, as others, though as their
names were written in the Lamb's book of life, so this was manifest to
themselves and others, as if his name and his Father's had been written
in their foreheads; but rather adoption, the new name of a child of God,
they having the spirit of adoption, whereby they cried, "Abba", Father,
and being openly and manifestly the children of God, by faith in Christ
Jesus; unless it should be thought there is an allusion to the
inscription in the mitre on the forehead of the high priest, "holiness
to the Lord", and so be expressive of that visible holiness which will
be on the saints in the spiritual reign of Christ, which this vision
respects; see [Zac 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md); or to the
frontlets between the eyes of the people of Israel, to put them in mind
of the law, and their obedience to it, [Deu
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008.md); and so may here denote the
engagements of those saints in the service of God; though perhaps no
more is intended than their open and hearty profession of their faith,
and that they were not ashamed of appearing in the cause of God and
truth; nor of Christ and his words, his Gospel and ordinances: the
Alexandrian copy, the Complutensian edition, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac,
and Arabic versions, read, "having his name, (the Lamb's,) and his
Father's name written in their foreheads"; and the Ethiopic version
adds, "and of his Holy Spirit". Mr. Daubuz thinks this vision refers to
the times of Constantine, and to the Christians then, and particularly
the council of Nice, and as contemporary with that in [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md).

[Revelation 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 14:2</span></span>

And I heard a voice from heaven,.... The same with the voices heard in
heaven upon the sounding of the seventh trumpet, [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md);

as the voice of many waters; very loud, and uttered by a great multitude
of people, signified by waters in this book, [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md); the same with those that praise
the Lord for the destruction of antichrist, and for the marriage of the
Lamb, [Rev 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md);

and as the voice of a great thunder; to which the Gospel may be compared
for its open, loud publication, being heard far and near, as thunder is:

and I heard the voice of harpers, harping with their harps; that is,
singing the praises of God, for the fall of Babylon, the happy state and
condition of the church, and the blessings of grace; the harp being a
musical instrument, used under the Old Testament in singing praise:
Brightman thinks that these different sounds represent the course of
Gospel doctrine, and the church's voice throughout the reign of
antichrist; that when the church first went into the wilderness, her
voice was like the murmuring of waters, confused and indistinct; when
she began to revive under the Waldenses and Albigenses, Wickliff, Huss,
&c. her voice was like thunder, loud and terrible; and at the
Reformation, it was as the voice of harpers, when confessions of faith
were published with sweet harmony and consent. Others have thought that
the different properties and efficacy of the Gospel are designed; as its
rapidity and irresistible force, by the many waters; its striking and
shaking the consciences of men, by the thunder, Christ's ministers being
sometimes "Boanergeses", sons of thunder; and its harmonious music,
pleasant sound, peace, joy, and comfort it brings, by the voice of
harpers. The Alexandrian copy, the Complutensian edition, the Vulgate
Latin, and all the Oriental versions, read, "the voice which I heard was
as harpers", &c.

[Revelation 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 14:3</span></span>

And they sung as it were a new song,.... The song of redeeming grace;
the same with that in [Rev 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md); see
the note there: this is to be understood of the 144,000, who sung it

before the throne, and before the four beasts and the elders; that is,
publicly in the church, the ministers and members being present; of
these; See Gill on [Rev 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md); See Gill
on [Rev 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md);

and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four
thousand, which were redeemed from the earth; out of every kindred,
tongue, people, and nation; from among the men of the earth, and out of
the apostate church, called the earth, in opposition to the pure church,
which so often goes by the name of heaven in this book; and these, in
consequence of being redeemed by the blood of Christ, were called by
grace out of the world; and such only can sing the song of redemption
with application to themselves; and say he has redeemed us, and loved
us, and washed us from our sins in his blood; to none but these is it
given to know spiritually and experimentally the mysteries of electing
and redeeming grace; the natural and carnal man neither knows nor
receives the things of the Spirit of God; nor can he learn them by
hearing, reading, study, and conversation, unless it be only in a
notional and speculative way. The Jews speak of a new song, which the
angels have never used (m);

"it is said, [Psa 98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md); "sing unto the
Lord a new song"; a new song, for there is an old song; but this song is
what the angels never praised him with, and therefore it is new;''

and indeed the song of redeeming love is peculiar to men.

[Revelation 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 14:4</span></span>

These are they which were not defiled with women,.... With the whore of
Rome, and her harlots, she is the mother of; while the kings and
inhabitants of the earth were drunk with the wine of their fornication,
or committed idolatry with them, which is spiritual fornication, and is
here meant by being defiled with them, these were free from such
pollutions, or idolatrous practices:

for they are virgins; for their beauty and comeliness in Christ,
chastity, sincerity of their love, uncorruptness in doctrine and
worship, and for the uprightness of conversation; See Gill on [Mat
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md);

these are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth; as the
sheep follow the shepherd of the flock, and which is a character of
Christ's sheep, [Joh 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004.md). These
follow Christ in the exercise of the graces of humility, patience, and
love; and in the performance of the several duties of religion, and
subjection to ordinances, and in the path of sufferings; and in every
way in which Christ the Lamb has gone before them, or in his word and
providence leads and directs them to, whether it be grateful to the
flesh or not; particularly they follow where he is preached, and his
Word and ordinances are faithfully administered; and they follow him to
heaven, where he is: it was part of the oath taken by the Roman
soldiers, ' , "to follow the generals wherever they should lead" (n), to
which it is thought there is an allusion here; see [Sa2
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#021.md);

these were redeemed from among men; "by Jesus", as the Syriac and Arabic
versions add, and so the Complutensian edition; by the blood of Christ,
for all men are not redeemed by it; and in consequence of this they were
called, and delivered from this present evil world, and the men of it,
and from a vain, wicked, and idolatrous conversation with it:

being the firstfruits unto God, and to the Lamb; in allusion to the
firstfruits under the law, which represented and sanctified the lump,
and showed that harvest was coming; so these persons are called the
firstfruits to God, and to the Lamb, being called by grace, and
consecrated to their worship and service, with reference to the harvest
of souls, or that large number of them which will be gathered in during
the spiritual reign of Christ, which these persons will be at the
beginning of; and as those who are first called and converted in a
country or nation are said to be the firstfruits of it, [Rom
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005.md); so these being the first, in the
period of time to which respect is had, bear this name; and as the
converted Jews received the firstfruits of the Spirit, on the day of
Pentecost, and at other times, so these will receive the firstfruits of
the far greater pouring forth of the Spirit in the latter day, which
will begin, and usher in the kingdom of Christ; see [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md).

[Revelation 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 14:5</span></span>

And in their mouth was found no guile,.... Or "a lie", as the
Complutensian edition, the Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, and all
the Oriental versions read; by which may be meant idolatry, for idols
and idolatrous practices are often called lies, and lying vanities; see
[Jer 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019.md); and the sense is, that the
superstition and idolatry of the church of Rome were not among them: or
it may design false doctrine, and the meaning be, that they did not
speak lies in hypocrisy, as the followers of antichrist do; nor were
they given up to believe a lie, as they are: the generality of copies
read, "no guile"; which is expressive of the sincerity of their words;
there was no deceit nor hypocrisy in them; they did not speak with
flattering lips to men, nor did they draw nigh to God with their mouths,
when their hearts were far from him; they were Israelites indeed, like
Nathanael, in whom was no guile; though not in so strict a sense, in
which this phrase is used of Christ, [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md);

for they are without fault before the throne of God; not as considered
in themselves, as if they were entirely free from sin, and never
committed any; though it might be true of them, that in general they
were of unblemished lives and conversations, that is, not guilty of any
notorious and scandalous crimes; but rather the sense is, that they were
without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, as being washed in the blood
of Christ, and so cleansed from all sin, and as being justified by his
righteousness from all iniquity; and so were before the throne of God,
and in the sight of divine justice, unblamable and unreproveable; see ,
[Col 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md); the phrase, "before the
throne of God", is left out in the Alexandrian copy, and in the Syriac,
Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, and in the Complutensian edition.

[Revelation 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 14:6</span></span>

And I saw another angel,.... This is to be understood not of one of the
ministering spirits so called; for though wings are sometimes ascribed
to angels, and Gabriel is said to fly swiftly; and though they desire to
look into the mysteries of the everlasting Gospel, yet the preaching of
that is not committed to any of them; but a minister of the Gospel is
intended, who is the angel of the church, for in this book pastors of
churches are so called, [Rev 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020.md); and
not a single minister of the Gospel is meant, but a set of Gospel
ministers; and some think that those are designed who appeared in the
eighth and ninth centuries, both in the eastern and western empire,
against the worshipping of images; since this angel calls upon the
inhabitants of the earth to fear God, give glory to him, and worship
him, and not images; but there was little of the everlasting Gospel
preached in those times. Others are of opinion that those who preceded,
and led on to the Reformation, are pointed at by this angel, such as
Wickliff in England, Franciscus Petrarcha in Italy, John Huss and Jerom
of Prague in Bohemia, with others; but these also had not the
everlasting Gospel in its clearness and purity, nor did they preach it
to all the inhabitants of the earth; rather I think a set of Gospel
preachers are intended, who will appear at the beginning of the
spiritual reign of Christ, and will be a means of ushering it in; and
these are the watchmen of Zion, who will give the Lord no rest till he
has made Jerusalem the praise of the whole earth; and who will then see
eye to eye in Gospel mysteries, and will publish good tidings of peace
and salvation, and proclaim Zion's King reigning, [Isa
62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md); this angel is called "another",
being distinct from the voice heard [Rev
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002.md), though he is the first with
respect to the following angels, as appears from [Rev
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009.md); the place where John saw this
angel, and the position he was in, follow:

fly in the midst of heaven: the church, the great congregation, the
several congregations of the saints; in the midst of which these
ministers will preach righteousness, salvation, loving kindness, and
truth, as Christ has done before them; and from hence the word of the
Lord will go forth to all parts of the world: they will preach the
Gospel openly and publicly, with great freedom, boldness, and
intrepidity, in the view of all men, not fearing the faces of any; and
the Gospel ministered by them will have a swift, sudden, and universal
spread; they themselves will run to and fro, and the Gospel will run and
be glorified, and the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the
Lord, and multitudes will flock to Christ, who in that day will be alone
exalted; for these ministers will come forth publicly:

having the everlasting Gospel; the Gospel in its fulness and purity; the
Gospel of the grace of God, of free justification by the righteousness
of Christ, of peace and pardon by his blood, and of complete salvation
by him; called everlasting, because the substance of it was settled from
all eternity, in the council and covenant of peace; it was ordained
before the world was, and was hid in God from the beginning; and the
revelation of it was of old; it was made to our first parents
immediately after the fall, and was spoken of by all God's holy prophets
which have been since the world began; it was preached before unto
Abraham, and in the times of Isaiah, and by other prophets, and so is no
new upstart doctrine: besides, the matter of it is everlasting; it
treats of everlasting things; of the eternal election of persons to
salvation; of God's everlasting love to them; of an everlasting covenant
he made with Christ on their account; of blessings, promises, and grace
given to them in him, before the world began; and of his being set up so
early as a Mediator, and of his going forth in a way of grace from
everlasting; as well as it reveals an everlasting righteousness, and
brings life and immortality, or eternal life to light, or shows the way
to everlasting life and happiness; to which may be added, that it will
abide for ever, it will always remain, and that inexpugnable, maugre all
the opposition of hell and earth; it will continue till all the elect of
God are gathered in, notwithstanding the violence of persecutors, or the
craft of seducers; nor will it be antiquated and made void by another
Gospel succeeding it, for there will be no other: now this the ministers
of those times will "have"; not in their heads only, by knowledge, but
in their hearts, by experience, and will have it in their mouths, and
speak it out freely and openly, and will have a commission from Christ
to preach it, and gifts qualifying them for it:

to preach to them that dwell on the earth; that are in the apostate
church, carnal, unregenerate, and earthly persons. The Complutensian
edition reads, "that sit on the earth"; as persons abject, mean, and
distressed, to whom the Gospel is acceptable:

and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people; whether Jews,
Turks, or Pagans; for the Gospel, as before observed, will now have an
universal spread all the world over.

[Revelation 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 14:7</span></span>

Saying with a loud voice,.... These ministers shall lift up their voice
like a trumpet, and cry aloud, and deliver out the Gospel fully and
faithfully, with great authority and power, and with much vehemence,
zeal, and fervency:

fear God; or "the Lord", as some copies, the Vulgate Latin and Arabic
versions, read: not the antichristian beast and his followers, as men
formerly had done; but God the Lord, and him not with a servile fear, or
a fear of punishment, of wrath, hell, and damnation; nor with a distrust
of his grace, love, power, and providence, much less with an
hypocritical fear; but with a godly fear, which has the goodness of God
for its object, and springs from a sense of the love of God, and is a
reverential affection for him, and is attended with faith and spiritual
joy, and includes all worship of him, both internal and external; hence
the Syriac version renders it, "serve God": and this shows that the
duties of religion are to be inculcated by Gospel ministers; and that
they will be urged by them when the everlasting Gospel is preached in
its greatest purity:

and give glory to him; and not to graven images, which he will not
allow; and glory is to be given to him, on account of the perfections of
his nature, and, the works of his hands; and is given when men ascribe
greatness to him, praise his works of creation, and acquiesce in those
of Providence, acknowledging the power, goodness, and wisdom of God in
all; and when they give thanks for all his mercies, temporal and
spiritual, and especially for Jesus Christ; and when they exercise faith
on him as their God in Christ, and ascribe their salvation to him and to
the Lamb, and not to the works of their hands; and when they attend his
worship, and the duties of religion, and so glorify him with their
bodies and spirits, which are his:

for the hour of his judgement is come; not of the great and last
judgment, but of the government of the Lord Christ, committed to him by
God the Father; in which sense the word is used in [Joh
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md) for now will the time be come,
when the kingdoms of this world will be his; and he will take to himself
his great power, and reign, in a spiritual manner, in the world; and now
also will be his time of judging the dead, or of avenging his people,
whose blood has been shed for him, and of his judging the great whore,
or of inflicting his judgments upon antichrist and his followers; all
which will be under the sounding of the seventh trumpet, to which this
vision is contemporary; see [Rev 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md)

and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the
fountains of waters; God, the Creator of all things; and not the beasts,
nor idols, the works of men's hands.

[Revelation 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 14:8</span></span>

And there followed another angel,.... A "second", as the Alexandrian
copy, the Complutensian edition, and the Syriac version add; and the
Arabic version reads, "and the second angel followed"; another set of
Gospel ministers, who will immediately follow upon the former,
proclaiming the fall of Babylon, which will be brought about through the
preaching of the everlasting Gospel. Some think the Waldenses and
Albigenses are here designed, who gave a great blow to Babylon, and laid
a foundation for her ruin. Others have thought that Luther, and the
reformers of his times, are intended, who gave a deadly blow to Babylon,
and she has been falling ever since: but to me it appears, that a set of
ministers in the spiritual reign of Christ are meant, who will not only
signify the fall of Babylon to be certain, and near at hand, but will
live to see and declare her actual fall, as follows:

saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city; which is to be
understood not of the world in general, which will not now be come to an
end, for all nations of the world are distinguished from this Babylon in
the next clause, and is only represented as a city, though a great one;
nor of Babylon in Chaldea, which was fallen many hundreds of years
before this vision; nor is there any likelihood of its being restored,
nor any reason to believe that it will ever more be the seat of empire
over all the nations and kings of the earth, as the Babylon mentioned in
this book is, [Rev 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md) though
undoubtedly the allusion is to that Babylon, and the very words are used
which express the fall of it, and are taken from it; see [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md) but this is to be understood of
Rome, which all along in this book is called the great city; see [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md) and not of Rome Pagan, for that
is fallen already; and the account of the fall of that is given before,
at the opening of the sixth seal, and the casting the dragon out of
heaven, upon the war there, between Michael and him, though Mr. Daubuz
is of opinion that this is here meant; but of Rome Papal, called Babylon
the great, [Rev 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005.md) and so the
Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac and Arabic versions, read
here; and the Romish antichrist is so called, because that city was
famous for its pride and haughtiness, for its tyranny and cruelty, and
for its idolatry; and indeed its name, which signifies "confusion", well
agrees with the Papacy, which is a confused mixture of Judaism,
Paganism, and Christianity: so Rome is called Babel in some ancient
writings of the Jews (o), where some copies read "Babel", others read
"Rome"; and Tertullian, who wrote long before the appearance of the
Romish antichrist, says (p), with our John, Babylon is a figure of the
Roman city: and of this it is said, that it "is fallen, is fallen";
which words are repeated for the certain confirmation of it, as matter
of fact; for the fall of antichrist will certainly be in the spiritual
reign of Christ, in the Philadelphian church state; See Gill on [Rev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md) now will Babylon come in
remembrance before God, and he will pour out the vials of his wrath upon
her, and will give men an aversion to her; and through the preaching of
the Gospel she will fall, just as the walls of Jericho fell at the
sounding of the rams' horns: the reason of which fall will be,

because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication: by her "fornication" is meant the idolatry of the church of
Rome; so the idolatry of Israel and Judah is often expressed in the Old
Testament by fornication and whoredoms; see [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md) and the wine of it designs the
alluring methods used to draw into it; such as the riches and honours,
and pleasures of this world, promised to men, and the great appearances
of holiness and religion, the deceivableness of unrighteousness, the
miracles, signs, and lying wonders done by them, by which men are made
sottish and stupid, and induced to believe a lie; just as wine
intoxicates, and inclines and excites to lust: and by "the wrath" of it
is meant either the heat of lust unto it, or the wrath of God against
them which is stirred up by it; and now the aggravation of her sin is,
that she not only drinks of this wine herself, or commits idolatry,
being instigated to it by the allurements of it, though she hereby
incurs the displeasure and wrath of God, but she draws all nations into
the same idolatrous practices.

[Revelation 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 14:9</span></span>

And the third angel followed them,.... The two preceding ones, and that
very quickly; by whom is meant not Luther, and his associates in the
Reformation, as some think; nor his successors, or the ministers of the
Gospel in general from his time till Christ's second coming, as others
have thought; but a set of Gospel ministers in the spiritual reign of
Christ: the first set of them publish the everlasting Gospel, which
leads on to the ruin of antichrist; the second set proclaim the downfall
of Rome, and this third set denounce the wrath of God upon all that have
professed the Popish religion:

saying with a loud voice; as the first angel did, with like authority
and vehemence, in order to strike terror, and express indignation:

if any man worship the beast and his image; give in to the idolatries of
the church of Rome, and embrace, maintain, and defend the Popish
religion, which bears a resemblance to the worship of the Heathens, and
is the very image of Rome Pagan; see [Rev
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004.md)

and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand; openly profess
Popery, and swear allegiance to the man of sin, and do all they can to
support his interest; see [Rev 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016.md).

[Revelation 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 14:10</span></span>

The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,.... Which is a
just punishment for their sin; that as such have drank of the wine of
the wrath of Rome's fornication, [Rev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md) so they shall now drink of the
wine of God's wrath; it is usual in Scripture to express the punishment
God inflicts upon wicked men by his wrath, and by the wine cup of his
fury; and their suffering such punishment, by their drinking of it; see
[Jer 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md) so , "the wine of wrath",
is a phrase used by the Jews (q):

which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation;
sometimes called a cup of fury and of trembling, [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md) and is sometimes said to be full
of mixture, [Psa 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md) of various
ingredients of wrath and fury; and the words may be rendered here,
"which is mixed without mixture": and though it seems to carry in it a
contradiction, yet is true in different senses; it may be said to be
mixed as wine with various sorts, which is the stronger, and sooner
inebriates and intoxicates; or in allusion to the cup the Jews gave to
malefactors, to stupefy them, when going to execution, which had various
things put in it for that purpose; See Gill on [Mar
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#023.md) and so designs the several
ingredients in the cup of divine indignation, or the several ways in
which God expresses his wrath; and yet it is without mixture; it is
judgment without mercy, pure wrath, without the least allay; not so much
as a drop of cold water granted, or the least your shown, or any
mitigation of fury for a moment:

and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone: in allusion to the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, which are now a burning and a
sulphurous lake, called Asphaltites, and is an example, pattern, and
similitude of the vengeance of eternal fire, [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007.md) and hence the beast and false
prophet are said to be cast into such a lake, [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md) and here their followers will be
punished; which is expressive of the horrible torments of hell, and the
dreadful punishment of the antichristian party there; see [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md) and what will aggravate their
misery is, that it will be

in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; the
latter will be their Judge, and will condemn them to everlasting
burnings, and pronounce the sentence on them; and the former will be the
executioners of it; they will gather them out, and sever them from the
righteous, and cast them into the furnace of fire, and will be
spectators of their punishment, and rejoice at it; and the sight of
their power and glory will increase the torment of the sufferers.

[Revelation 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 14:11</span></span>

And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever,.... That
is, the smoke of that fire which torments them will for ever arise; or,
in other words, there will be no end of their torment; hence their
misery is called everlasting fire, everlasting punishment, and
everlasting destruction, [Mat 25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md)
and smoke being very troublesome and distressing, is mentioned to set
forth the very uncomfortable state of the wicked; and so it is used by
Jewish writers: hence we read of , "the smoke of hell" (r), with which
the eyes of the wicked will be filled in the world to come:

and they have no rest, day nor night; the fire of divine wrath which
tortures them is never quenched, and the worm of conscience which gnaws
them never dies: this is directly contrary to a notion of the Jews, that
the wicked in hell have rest sometimes; they talk of angels blowing away
the smoke from them, so that they have rest an hour and a half; and
which they say they have three times a day, and whenever Israel says
Amen, let his great name be blessed (s); and particularly that hell fire
never burns on the sabbath day, nor does the smoke of it ascend then,
and that the wicked have always rest on that days (t); though sometimes
they contradict themselves, and say they never have any rest (u), which
is the truth:

who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of
his name; that is, whoever are the followers of antichrist, or the
professors of the Popish religion; so far is salvation from being in the
church of Rome, and only there, that there is none in it; and whoever
live and die in the profession of Popery, shall surely be damned as this
passage is true.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 14:12</span></span>

Here is the patience of the saints,.... That which has required their
patience, and about which it has been exercised, what they have been
patiently waiting for, namely, the destruction of antichrist; and now it
will be come, and patience will have its perfect work; see [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md)

here are they that keep the commandments of God; and not the inventions
of men, and the traditions of antichrist, but the ordinances of the
Gospel, as they were at first delivered, without any adulteration and
corruption; and who kept them because they were enjoined by God, and
from a principle of love to him, and with a view to his glory: these are
distinguished from the worshippers of the beast, and were preserved
throughout the apostasy; these are the witnesses who will now be risen,
and the remnant of the woman's seed, with whom the dragon made war by
the beast: and these are the hundred and forty and four thousand who are
before described; these will be in a very glorious and comfortable
church state; the word will be purely preached, and the ordinances truly
administered, and the doctrines of the Gospel will be heartily embraced
and professed: it follows,

and the faith of Jesus; meaning either the grace of faith, of which
Jesus is the object, author, and finisher; and which these saints will
have from him, and exercise upon him in a very strong and comfortable
manner; and which, and the profession of it, they will hold fast to the
end; or else the doctrine of faith, concerning the person, office, and
grace of Jesus Christ, the faith once delivered to the saints, which
they will have contended for, stood fast in, and now will hold in a pure
conscience: these seem to be the words of John, declaring the faith,
patience, and obedience of the saints of these times.

[Revelation 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 14:13</span></span>

And I heard a voice from heaven,.... Like that which was heard at
Christ's baptism and transfiguration, certifying the truth of what
follows, so that that may be depended upon as an undoubted verity:

saying unto me, write; which is a further confirmation of the following
sayings being true and faithful; see [Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md)

blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; merely to
die is not an happiness, for death is common to all, good and bad; it is
a disunion of soul and body, and cannot be in itself desirable; it is
the fruit of sin, and has something in it awful and terrible; and though
it is the privilege of believers, as its sting is removed by Christ, yet
not as simply and absolutely considered; but to die in the Lord is a
blessedness: some render the words, "which die for the Lord"; so the
Arabic version, "which die for the faith of the Lord"; and the Ethiopic
version, "which die for God"; and so restrain them to the martyrs of
Jesus: to suffer death for the sake of Christ and his Gospel is a gift
and an honour, and what glorifies Christ; and there is a glory
consequent upon it, which such shall enjoy; but then in the spiritual
reign of Christ, to which this passage refers, and after the destruction
of antichrist, there will be no more suffering for Christ, no more
martyrdoms; wherefore this cannot be the sense of the words: nor do they
mean dying in the lively exercise of faith and hope in the Lord; for
though it is a happiness so to die, both to persons themselves, and to
their friends and relations, yet these are not the only persons that are
blessed; there are some who all their lifetime are subject to bondage,
and go off in the dark, and yet are happy; but to die in the Lord is to
die interested in him, in union to him; which union is not dissolved by
death, and which preserves from all condemnation, at death or at
judgment, and secures the soul's immediate entrance into happiness, and
the resurrection of the body at the last day, and therefore such must be
blessed: the phrase, "from henceforth", is differently placed; the
Ethiopic version connects it with the word "write", rendering it, "write
now"; and the Vulgate Latin version reads it with the next clause,
"hereafter, yea, saith the Spirit"; and so the Latin interpreter of the
Syriac version, though that itself seems rather to place it as ours
does, and which is most correct; and is to be understood not of the time
of John's writing, thenceforward to the resurrection; for those that
died before his time were as happy as those who died after; nor of the
time of death, though it is a truth, that from the time of the saints'
death, and from the very moment of their separation, they are blessed,
and are in a state of happiness until the resurrection; but of that
period of time which the declarations made by the three preceding angels
refer to, from thenceforward, and after the destruction of antichrist,
and during the spiritual reign of Christ: and the sense is, that happy
will those persons be that die in Christ within that time, and before
the Laodicean church state takes place; when coldness, lukewarmness, and
carnal security will seize upon men, and Christ will come upon them at
an unawares; and those sharp and severe times will commence, signified
by the harvest and vintage of the earth in the following verses, and
which seem to be no other than the end of the world, and the destruction
of it; wherefore happy will they be that are going to heaven before that
time comes; see [Ecc 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md)

yea, saith the Spirit; the third witness in heaven, who sets his seal to
the truth of what the voice declares, and shows wherein this blessedness
will consist:

that they may rest from their labours; both of body and soul; from all
toil of body, and laborious work, from all diseases and distempers of
body, and all outward sorrows and calamities men labour under, and are
fatigued with in this life; and from all inward troubles, from a body of
sin, from the temptations of Satan, and from all doubts and fears, from
their present warfare state, and all conflicts with their spiritual
enemies:

and their works do follow them; they do not go before them, to prepare
heaven and happiness for them; nor do they take them along with them,
and use them as pleas for their admission into the heavenly glory; but
they will follow them, and will be found to praise, and honour, and
glory, and will be taken notice of by Christ, and graciously rewarded by
him, at his appearing and kingdom. This is directly opposite to the
notions of the Jews, who say, that when a man departs this life, his
works "go before him", and say unto him, thou hast done so and so, in
such a place, and on such a day (w); and that whoever does a good work
in this world, it shall "go before him" in the world to come (x); and so
they (y) represent good works as saying to a man when he is about to
die,

"go in peace; before thou gettest thither, , we will go before thee, as
it is said, [Isa 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md) "thy
righteousness shall go before thee".''

Sometimes they say (z), they go along with him at the time of a man's
departure: neither gold, nor silver, nor precious stones and pearls
accompany him, but the law and good works, as it is said, [Pro
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#022.md) "when thou goest it shall lead
thee", &c.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 14:14</span></span>

And I looked, and behold a white cloud,.... In this verse is a
description of the person principally concerned in the harvest of the
earth, hereafter mentioned; by whom is designed not some great potentate
or prince, an encourager of the Reformation among his subjects; nor an
angel in an human shape; nor Martin Luther, as others; but the Lord
Jesus Christ himself, who is described by his form, and by his seat, and
by what he had on his head, and in his hand:

and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man; so Christ is said
to be, [Rev 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013.md) and in [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md) where there is a like vision of
him as here, and which refers to the same time; it is a name by which
the Messiah is often called, and is expressive of the truth of his human
nature, who was found in fashion as a man, and was really one; for his
being like to the son of man designs reality and truth, and not mere
appearance; see [Mat 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#005.md) and besides,
as this was in vision, it is very properly expressed, for Christ
appeared to John in vision like to that human nature in which he is at
the right hand of God: and here he is seen "sitting" upon the "white
cloud"; which shows that he was come to judgment in the clouds of
heaven, and was set on one of them, as on a throne; and a white cloud
represents the purity, uprightness, and justness of his proceedings in
judgment; for which reason he is said to be on a white throne, [Rev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011.md)

having on his head a golden crown; as an ensign of royal majesty,
showing that his kingdom was now come, the time for him to reign
personally with his saints on earth a thousand years; and that it was a
very glorious one; and that he should now reign before his ancients
gloriously; and that it was pure, solid, and durable; see [Psa
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md)

and in his hand a sharp sickle: to reap the earth with, as hereafter,
and is expressive of his power as King of saints and Judge of the world,
to gather all nations before him; for the sickle is used to gather with,
as well as to cut down.

[Revelation 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 14:15</span></span>

And another angel came out of the temple,.... Not the Holy Spirit, who,
being God omniscient, knows the day and hour of judgment, which is a
secret to men and angels, as Napier thinks; since though he dwells in
the church as his temple, yet is never called an angel; nor does this
angel represent the souls under the altar, who come out from thence, and
importunately desire vengeance on the inhabitants of the earth, the
worshippers of the beast, who had shed their blood; but rather the
mighty angels who shall descend from heaven with Christ, and who shall
be employed by him as reapers, to gather in his elect from the four
winds, as well as to bind up the tares in bundles, and burn them; unless
a set of Gospel ministers, as before, should be intended, who either by
divine revelation, or by the signs of the time being come, and observed
by them, will know that the harvest, or end of the world, is come; since
this angel is said to come out of the temple, the church, which had been
measured, and was now opened in heaven, and from whence angels are said
to come, [Rev 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md)

crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud: as the first and
third angels did, [Rev 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md) denoting
great vehemence and importunity: thrust in thy sickle, and reap: which
being spoken by an inferior angel, whether this designs the ministering
spirits, or preachers of the word, must be understood not as commanding,
nor even directing what should be done, but as beseeching and
entreating: see [Psa 132:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008.md). Dr.
Lightfoot thinks, and not without reason, that there is here some
allusion to the putting in of the sickle, and reaping the first corn in
Judea, at the feast of the passover, by the order of the sanhedrim,
which sat in the temple; nor did any reap till they had the word given
them, "reap", by the messengers of the court, called , "the angels", or
messengers "of the sanhedrim": to whom the reaper said, shall I reap?
and they say to him, (a), "reap": the reasons follow:

for the time is come for thee to reap; the time of the end of the world,
and of the judgment of it, which is fixed by God; and of Christ's coming
to judge both quick and dead, and of the first resurrection, or the
resurrection of the saints:

for the harvest of the earth is ripe: the measure of the sins of wicked
men will now be filled up, and the afflictions of the saints will be
accomplished in them, and the number of God's elect will be completed in
the effectual calling; they will be all called, and so things will be
ripe for the second coming of Christ. There seems to be some reference
to [Joe 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013.md) "put ye in the sickle,
for the harvest is ripe": the Jewish doctors ask (b), to whom is this
said? R. Phineas, in the name of R. Hilkiah, says, "to the angels"; so
the mighty ones, in [Rev 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011.md) are by
Kimchi interpreted of the angels.

[Revelation 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 14:16</span></span>

And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth,.... He
put forth, and made use of that power which he had in his hand, in
answer to the entreaty of the angel, the time being fully come which was
fixed for this great event:

and the earth was reaped; and the harvest of it was got in; reaping and
harvest sometimes are used in an ill sense, and design the wrath of God,
and his judgments inflicted upon men; see [Isa
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#005.md). Hence some think, that both this
and the vintage following intend the judgments of God upon antichrist,
and that they are contemporary with the pouring out of the fifth and
sixth vials upon the beast and his followers; and the rather, since the
destruction of Babylon, literally taken, is expressed in such language,
[Jer 51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033.md) though these seem to have
respect to times after the fall of the Romish Babylon, before declared
in [Rev 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md) and most interpreters
refer the harvest to the last judgment at the end of the world; and
which sense is greatly countenanced, and to be illustrated by the
parable of the tares and wheat, in [Mat
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030.md) sometimes these phrases are used
in a good sense, and intend the gathering in of souls by the preaching
of the Gospel; as there are the appointed weeks of the harvest, so there
is a time fixed for the calling and conversion of God's elect; and when
this time is come, and especially to any number of them in any
particular place, it is an harvest, as in Galilee and Samaria in the
times of Christ, [Mat 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037.md) the reapers
are the ministers of the Gospel; such were the apostles of Christ, [Joh
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#036.md) and the sickle is the Gospel, by
which not only men are cut to the heart, and cut down, and removed from
their old bottom, and principles and practices, but are gathered to
Christ, and into his churches; and when large numbers are brought in, it
is an harvest time, as in the times of Christ and his apostles; see [Isa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md) hence some interpreters think that
the harvest here has respect to the Reformation, which followed upon the
preaching of Luther, Calvin, and others, when a large harvest of souls
were gathered in, in Germany, France, England, and elsewhere; but rather
it may be thought to refer to the conversion of the Jews, and the
bringing in the fulness of the Gentiles in the latter day, in the
spiritual reign of Christ, to which the preceding visions belong, as we
have seen; the earth will be reaped indeed, and a great harvest it will
be, when a nation shall be born at once, and the vast multitudes of the
Gentiles shall be brought in, as in [Isa
66:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#008.md) and the rather this may be judged
to be the meaning of it, since the passage from whence these phrases are
borrowed respects the bringing again the captivity of Judah and
Jerusalem, [Joe 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001.md) though it seems
best to understand it of the Lord's wheat harvest at the end of the
world, when the wheat of the earth shall be reaped, and gathered into
Christ's barn, or garner, or into his and his Father's kingdom; this
reaping of the earth is the removing of the saints out of it, not by
death, but by the resurrection of them from the dead; for when Christ
shall come in the clouds of heaven, and sit on the white cloud, or
throne, the dead in him will rise first, and the living saints will be
changed, and both will be caught up together, to meet the Lord in the
air; so that the earth will be reaped, and be clear of them, and there
will be none left in it but the wicked of the world; and what will
become of them is declared in the following verses, under the
representation of a vintage.

[Revelation 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 14:17</span></span>

And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven,.... It is a
strange conceit of Mr. Brightman's, that this angel is Thomas Lord
Cromwell, in the days of King Henry the Eighth, a sincere favourer of
pure religion; and that the following angel is Thomas Cranmer,
archbishop of Canterbury, a martyr, that had power over fire; and that
the vintage, here spoken of, refers to the destroying of religious
houses, and disposing of abbey lands to other uses; which was done under
the king's authority, by the former of these, at the instigation of the
latter, when those who were set over that business made such havoc of
the goods of the Papists, that their houses seemed to swim in their
spoils, as in a river of pressed grapes. Dr. Goodwin much better
interprets it of God's vengeance upon the carnal Protestants and
professors of religion; since it is an angel out of the temple that will
execute it, and another from the altar, zealous of God's worship, that
will provoke to it; and since the winepress will be trodden without the
city, the church; and which began in the wars in Germany, in the last
age, and will have its full accomplishment when the whole outward court
is given to the Gentiles; but how these, who are but a few, when
compared with the wicked of the world, should be called the vine of the
earth, I see not. Mr. Daubuz thinks this vision of the vintage has had,
at least in part, its fulfilment in the late wars in the times of Queen
Anne, the Popish countries being then made the seat of war, in which
they suffered much; rather they come nearest to the truth of the matter,
who take this to be the battle of the great God Almighty, under the
sixth vial, [Rev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014.md) fought by the
word of God, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who will tread the
winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God, [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md) when the beast and false prophet
will both be destroyed: but inasmuch as Babylon is before declared to be
fallen, [Rev 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md) and since the
gathering in of the Lord's wheat at the first resurrection is designed
by the harvest, it is best to understand this vintage of the perdition
of ungodly men by fire, at the conflagration of the world, which will be
at the beginning of the thousand years' reign, and of the gathering of
them in at the second resurrection, at the end of it, for the
destruction of them in hell, soul and body. And by this "angel" is
meant, not the saints of the most High; for though they may be said to
come out of the temple, the church, and shall judge the world, yet they
will not be employed in gathering together the wicked, and casting them
into the lake of fire, or winepress of God's wrath: rather the
ministering spirits are intended, who are the reapers at the end of the
world, and who will gather the wicked, and bind them like tares in
bundles, and cast them into the furnace of fire; though it is best to
interpret this of Christ himself, who is often called an Angel in
Scripture, as the Angel of God's presence; and the Angel of the
covenant; and frequently in this book, as in [Rev
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002.md) because, as Mediator, he is God's
messenger; and he may be said to do that, which he does by others, as
instruments, as to gather the vine of the earth, and cast it into the
winepress; and he may be said to "come out of the temple which is in
heaven": whether this be understood of heaven itself, which the temple,
and especially the most holy place in it, was a figure of; here Christ
is, and from hence he is expected to come, and will come at the last
day, as Judge of all the earth; or of the church of God, for here Christ
dwells, and grants his gracious and spiritual presence until his second
and personal coming, with all his saints: and now he will have them all
with him, both quick and dead, and will be personally in his temple, the
church, in the great congregation of the righteous, and out from among
them will he display his power in the destruction of the wicked; and the
rather he may be thought to be intended, since none but a divine person
ever trod the winepress of God's wrath; see [Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md) to which may be added what
follows,

he also having a sharp sickle; the same who is described as like to the
son of man, on a white cloud, with a golden crown on his head, and such
a sickle in his hand, [Rev 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014.md) which
is expressive of the same judiciary power and authority.

[Revelation 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 14:18</span></span>

And another angel came out from the altar,.... Where are the souls of
the martyrs of Jesus, [Rev 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md) and
whom this angel is thought by some to represent, in his address to him
that had the sharp sickle, crying for vengeance on the wicked of the
earth, who had shed their blood: the allusion seems to be to the altar
of burnt offerings, where the sacrifices were slain, and on which they
were burnt with fire; and which was an emblem of the strict justice of
God, showing, that those persons, for whom these sacrifices were
offered, deserved to be treated in like manner; and here the angel
coming from thence signifies, that he came on the behalf of the justice
of God, treating that he, to whom vengeance belonged, would execute it
upon all the ungodly, who were ripe for judgment: and hence it is
further said of him,

which had power over fire; whether the angels, as they have presided
over particular kingdoms and states, [Dan
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020.md) preside over the elements, since
this angel had power over fire, and another angel is called the angel of
the waters, [Rev 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005.md) may be
considered. According to the Jews (c) there are , "angels of fire", and
, "angels of the waters"; particularly it is said (d), that Gabriel is ,
"the prince of fire", or "that has power over fire", and Jurkemo is ,
"prince of hail", or has power over it: however, fire is to be taken
here, not for the Spirit, and his gifts, which not a created angel, but
Christ only, has a power over, to baptize with; nor the Gospel, nor
martyrdom, but rather the wrath of God, which in Scripture is often
compared to fire, of which this angel was an executioner: and indeed
here it may be referred, both literally to the burning of the world, and
the wicked in it, in which the angels may be concerned, who will descend
with Christ in flames of fire, taking vengeance on the wicked; and
figuratively to hell fire, and the destruction of the wicked in it, who
will be cast into it by the angels of God.

And cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, as in [Rev
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015.md) expressing like vehemence and
importunity,

saying, thrust in thy sharp sickle: not commanding or directing, but
entreating as before:

and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; not the vine of God's
planting, the vineyard of the Lord of hosts, the church of Christ; but
the vine of the earth, of wicked and earthly men, whose vine is the vine
of Sodom, &c. [Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032.md) and which is
spread over the whole earth; a wild vine, whose grapes are gall,
clusters bitter, and their wine the poison of dragons; and to such a
vine the wicked are compared, for their emptiness and unfruitfulness,
their uselessness and unprofitableness, and for their being fit fuel for
everlasting burnings; see [Eze 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002.md).
And the clusters of it may denote the great multitude of the wicked now
to be cut down, gathered in, and destroyed, the reason given,

for her grapes are fully ripe; their wickedness very great, their
iniquity full, the measure of their sins filled up, and they fitted for
destruction, and ripe for ruin; see [Joe
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013.md). Some understand this of the
degenerate church of Rome, and the destruction of it; see [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 14:19</span></span>

And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth,.... Before "upon the
earth", when the harvest was gathered in, the wheat being on the earth,
but not belonging to it; but here "into the earth", the vine being the
vine of the earth, rooted in it, and natural to it:

and gathered the vine of the earth; the Arabic version reads, "of the
whole earth"; in like manner as the tares in the parable are said to be
gathered, and bound in bundles, and cast into the fire, which, as here,
intends the destruction of the wicked, at the end of the world: this
vine may be said to be cut down at the burning of the world, and to be
gathered at the second resurrection, as the wheat harvest of the saints
will be at the first resurrection:

and cast it into the great winepress the wrath of God; the same with the
lake which burns with fire and brimstone, so often mentioned in this
book: the torments of the wicked will lie in the wrath of God being
poured forth upon them, and into them, which will be that fire that
cannot be quenched, and that worm that never dies; and this is signified
by the squeezing of grapes in a winepress, as God's judgments in this
world sometimes are, [Isa 63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md) and
which will be very heavy and intolerable, since this winepress will be
trod by the Lord God Almighty: and it is said to be a great one, as it
must needs be, to hold the vine of the whole earth, or all the wicked of
the world, who will be like the sand of the sea, innumerable; and this
will be big enough for them all, and they will all be cast into it at
once. Tophet is deep and large, [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md).

[Revelation 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 14:20</span></span>

And the winepress was trodden without the city,.... The beloved city,
the new Jerusalem, into which none of the wicked will enter, and without
which are dogs, &c. [Rev 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#009.md). The
allusion may be, as Dr. Lightfoot thinks, to the olive presses, which
were without the city of Jerusalem, from whence Gethsemane had its name,
whither our Lord went, and where his sorrows began the night he was
betrayed: hell is sometimes expressed by outer darkness, and said to be
far off from heaven, and between the one and the other a great gulf is
fixed, the distance is considerable; hence men are said to go forth to
behold the miseries of the wicked; see [Mat
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013.md).

and blood came out of the winepress; alluding to the juice squeezed out
of grapes, called the blood of grapes, [Gen
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md).

Even unto the horses' bridles, for the space of a thousand and six
hundred furlongs; which is only an hyperbolical expression, setting
forth the largeness and universality of the destruction of the wicked,
and the impossibility of their escaping it. In like manner the Jews
express a great slaughter of men; so of the slaughter at Bither, by
Adrian, they say (e), they went on slaying , "until a horse plunged in
blood up to his nostrils", and the blood ran four miles into the sea;
which is not to be understood literally, but as expressing a prodigious
effusion of blood: and as to

the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs, perhaps there may be
an allusion to the measure of the land of Israel, and the common notion
of it among the Jews, who make it to be the square of four hundred
parsoe (f): hence they often speak of the land of Israel shaking and
moving four hundred "parsoe", upon some extraordinary occasions (g); and
a "parsa" contained four miles (h), so that four hundred "parsoe" made a
thousand and six hundred miles; and if miles and furlongs are the same,
in which sense only the land of Israel could be so large, here is the
exact space; for Jerom (i), who was an inhabitant of it, says, it was
scarce 160 miles in length, to which agrees R. Menachem (k); and it may
be observed, that the Arabic version renders the words, "by the space of
a thousand and six hundred miles". The Ethiopic version, very wrongly,
reads, "sixteen furlongs".
