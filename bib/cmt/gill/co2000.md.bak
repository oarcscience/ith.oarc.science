INTRODUCTION TO 2 CORINTHIANS

This epistle, according to the subscription at the end of it, was
written from Philippi of Macedonia; and though the subscriptions annexed
to the epistles are not always to be depended on, yet it seems very
likely that this was written from thence; for the apostle not finding
Titus at Troas, as he expected, went into Macedonia, where he met with
him, and had an account from him of the success of his first epistle; of
the state and condition of the church, and of the temper and disposition
of mind in which the members of it were, and which gave him great
satisfaction; upon which he immediately wrote this second epistle, and
sent it by the same person to them; see [Co2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md), [Co2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005.md). It is very probable it might be
written the year after the former; and so it is placed by Dr. Lightfoot
in the year 56, as the former is in the year 55; though some place this
in the year 60, and the other in 59. The occasion of this epistle was
partly to excuse his not coming to them according to promise, and to
vindicate himself from the charge of unfaithfulness, levity, and
inconstancy on that account; and partly, since what he had wrote about
the incestuous person, had had a good effect both upon him and them, to
direct them to take off the censure that had been laid upon him, and
restore him to their communion, and comfort him; likewise to stir them
up to finish the collection for the poor saints they had begun; as also
to defend himself against the calumnies of the false teachers, who were
very industrious to sink his character and credit in this church; which
he does by observing the doctrines of the Gospel he preached, which were
far more glorious than, and abundantly preferable to, the ministration
of the law of Moses, which those men desired to be teachers of; as
likewise the success of his ministry in every place; the many sufferings
he had underwent for the sake of Christ, and his Gospel; the high
favours and privileges he had received of the Lord, as well as the
signs, wonders, and miracles done by him in proof of his apostleship;
and in which are interspersed many things useful and instructive.
