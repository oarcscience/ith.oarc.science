INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 8

To the chief Musician upon Gittith, a Psalm of David. Some think this
psalm was composed when the ark was brought to the house of Obededom the
Gittite; and that it was delivered to him and his sons, as others were
to Asaph, to Jeduthun, to the sons of Korah, &c. (l). But against this
lies a strong objection, that Obededom and his sons were porters, and
not singers, [Ch1 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#004.md); and for the
same reason "gittith" cannot be the name of a musical instrument which
was kept in his family, and presided over by them (m). Some are of
opinion this word had its name from Gath; and that this psalm was wrote
by David when he was there (y); or that it is the name of a musical
instrument invented and made there, and which was brought from thence
(z): And so the Targum paraphrases it;

"upon the harp which was brought from Gath.''

A word like this signifies "winepresses": and hence the Septuagint,
Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions, render it "for the winepresses":
which Theodoret interprets of churches, where Christ the true vine is
gathered by believers, and they prepare the mystic wine. Some think (a)
the psalms which bear this name were composed for the feast of
tabernacles: when, having got in their vintage, they filled their
presses, and squeezed their grapes, and therefore gave thanks; it was
usual, even with the Heathens (b), to make use of the harp, and other
instruments of music, at the gathering of the grapes to be squeezed and
pressed. Some of the Jewish writers (d) apply it to the times of Edom's
destruction, who was to be trodden down as in a winepress, foretold in
[Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md); and others interpret it of
the times of Gog and Magog, when the prophecy in [Joe
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013); shall be fulfilled (d.md) and some
have thought this psalm to be a song of praise, like one of those sung
by them that tread in the winepress; the time of vintage being a time of
joy. The ancient Christian writers explain it of the sufferings of
Christ, when he trod the winepress of his Father's wrath. But the word
"gittith" is either the first word of some song, as Aben Ezra thinks; or
the name of the tune, as Kimchi; or rather of the musical instrument to
which this psalm was set and sung. Though the author of the epistle to
the Hebrews, [Heb 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006.md); citing some
passages from this psalm, only says, "one in a certain place testified";
without mentioning either the number of the psalm, or the name of the
writer; yet it is certain that David was the penman of it: and both from
the testimony of that writer, and from a citation of Christ himself, it
is evident that the subject of this psalm is the Messiah, and that it
belongs to his times; see [Heb 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006.md). So
the Syriac scholiast;

"the eighth psalm is concerning Christ our Redeemer.''

[Psalms 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 8:1</span></span>

O Lord our God,.... Jehovah, the one God, who is Lord of all angels and
men, and in an especial manner Lord and King of saints;

how excellent is thy name in all the earth! by the "name" of God is not
meant any particular name of his, by which he is called; but either
himself, his nature and perfections; or rather that by which he is made
known, and particularly his Gospel; see [Joh
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md); this is excellent in its nature,
it being good news, and glad tidings of good things, which display the
love, grace, mercy, and kindness of God to men, as well as his wisdom,
power, truth, and faithfulness; and in the subject matter of it, Christ
and his righteousness, and life and salvation by him, the spiritual
blessings of grace it publishes, and the exceeding great and precious
promises it contains; and in its usefulness for the enlightening,
quickening, and converting sinners, and for the comforting and reviving
of drooping saints. It is the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, and
excels the law in glory. It cannot well be said how glorious it is; it
is marvellously excellent; and that "in all the earth", being carried by
the apostles, who were sent by Christ with it, into all the world; where
it has shone out, and appeared gloriously to Gentiles as well as Jews.
This clause shows that this is said by David prophetically of Gospel
times; for not in his time, nor in any period under the Old Testament,
was the name of the Lord glorious and excellent in all the earth. His
name was great in Israel, but not in all the world. He showed his word,
and gave his statutes and ordinances to Jacob; but as for the Gentiles,
they were without them, and were strangers to the covenants of promise,
[Psa 76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md); but this was true of the
first times of the Gospel; and will be still more fully accomplished
when the prophecies in [Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md);
shall be fulfilled;

who hast set thy glory above the heavens: meaning his Son, the Lord
Jesus Christ, the brightness of his glory; in whom is all the fulness of
the Godhead, the glory of all the divine perfections; so called [Psa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002.md); and the setting of him above the
heavens designs the exaltation of him at the right hand of God; where
angels, principalities, and powers, became subject to him, and he was
made higher than the heavens, [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md). And it was in consequence, and
by virtue of this, that the Gospel was spread throughout the earth; for
upon Christ's exaltation the Spirit was poured down upon the apostles,
and they were endowed with girls qualifying them to carry the Gospel
into each of the parts of the world.

[Psalms 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 8:2</span></span>

Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,.... Not literally such, though
the Jewish writers (e) generally so understand it; as do some Christian
interpreters, who explain it of the wonderful formation, nourishment,
and growth of infants; and of the marvellous care of God in providing
the breast for them; in filling it with milk, and teaching them to suck;
which, being observed by men, occasion praise to God, to the confusion
of atheists and infidels. But this is no other than what is common to
brute creatures: rather the words are to be understood in a figurative
sense. So Jarchi applies them to the priests and Levites in the temple:
but it is best to interpret them of the apostles and first preachers of
the Gospel; and of such who received it and professed it; who were in
their own eyes, and in the eyes of the world, as babes and sucklings,
[Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md);

hast thou ordained strength: by which is meant the Gospel, the rod of
Christ's strength, and the power of God unto salvation; and which being
made useful for the conversion of souls, is the cause of much praise and
thanksgiving to God: this, by the mouths and means of the apostles and
first ministers of the word, God ordained, or "founded" (f), settled and
established in the world, notwithstanding all the opposition made unto
it; so that the gates of hell cannot prevail against it, to root it out
of the world; but it will continue the everlasting Gospel;

because of thine enemies: either for the sake of subduing them, and
bringing them to the obedience of Christ, that is, the elect of God, who
are before conversion enemies to God and Christ; or rather for the sake
of confounding the implacable enemies of God and Christ, and of the
cause and interest of religion. In order to which God has made choice of
instruments the most mean and despicable, [Co1
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md); and God's end in this more
particularly is expressed in the following clause;

that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger; Satan, the enemy of
mankind, the adversary of Christ personal and mystical, who is filled
with envy, wrath, and malice, against Christ and his people; him, by
the, means of the Gospel and the ministry of it, God has "caused to
cease" (g), as the word may be rendered; not as to his being, but as to
his power and authority, in the Gentile world; out of which, to his
great mortification, he was cast, by the mouth and ministry of babes and
sucklings. These words are applied by Christ to the children in the
temple, crying Hosanna to the son of David, out of whose mouths God
perfected the praise of the Messiah; and by which, and Christ's defence
of them, the Scribes and Pharisees, the mortal enemies of Christ, and
who wanted to revenge themselves on him, were silenced and stilled, [Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md).

[Psalms 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 8:3</span></span>

When I consider thy heavens,.... Where God dwells, and which he has
made; the airy and starry heavens, which are to be seen with the bodily
eye; and the heaven of heavens, which is to be beheld and considered by
faith:

the work of thy fingers; being curiously wrought by his power, and
garnished by his Spirit: for the finger of God is the Spirit of God; see
[Mat 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028.md); compared with [Luk
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020.md);

the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained, or "prepared" (h), for
various uses to the earth, and the inhabitants of it. The sun is not
mentioned, because it cannot be looked upon, as the moon and the stars
may, nor be seen when they are. And it is generally thought that David
composed this psalm in the night, When these celestial bodies were in
view; and, it may be, while he was keeping his father's sheep, since, in
the enumeration of the creatures subject to man, sheep are mentioned
first, as being in view, [Psa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#007.md). The
heavenly bodies are very glorious creatures, and are worthy of the
consideration and contemplation of man, and even of a saint; whereby he
may be led to observe the wisdom, power, goodness, and greatness of God.

[Psalms 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 8:4</span></span>

What is man, that thou art mindful of him?.... That is, the psalmist,
while he was considering the greatness and glory of the celestial
bodies, thought this within himself, and so expressed it; which is to be
understood, not of man in general, nor of Adam in a state of innocence;
he could not be called "Enosh", the word here used, which signifies a
frail, weak, sickly mortal man; nor could he with any propriety be said
to be the son of man, as in the following clause: nor of fallen man, or
of Adam's posterity, descending from him by ordinary generation; for all
things are not put in subjection to them, as is hereafter said of man:
but this is to be understood of the man Christ Jesus, as it is
interpreted in [Heb 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006.md); or of that
individual of human nature which Christ assumed. The name of Enosh well
agrees with him, who was a man of no note and esteem among men, a worm
and no man, a man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs, encompassed
with infirmities, and was subject to death, and did die. Now it was a
marvellous thing that God should be mindful of that individual of human
nature; that he should prepare it in his council and covenant; that
among the vast numbers of individuals which it came up in his infinite
mind to create, he should choose this, to exalt it, and appoint it to
union with his own Son, and take that delight in it he did; that when it
was formed by his Spirit, he should anoint it with the oil of gladness
above his fellows; that he should take such providential care of it, and
so often and so strongly express his affection for it; that he should
regard it, and support it under sufferings; and when in the grave, did
not leave it, nor suffer it to see corruption; but raised it from the
dead, and gave it glory, and exalted it at his own right hand;

and the son of man, that thou visitest him? The name of "the son of man"
is the name of the Messiah, in [Psa
80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md); and is often given to Christ,
and used by him of himself in the New Testament. And this visiting of
him is not to be understood in a way of wrath, though he was so visited
by God, when he bore the chastisements of his people; but in a way of
favour, by bestowing upon him without measure the gifts and graces of
his Spirit; by affording him his gracious presence, and tilling him with
spiritual peace and joy.

[Psalms 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 8:5</span></span>

For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,.... Than Elohim,
"than God", as this word usually signifies: and could it be interpreted
of man, as made by God, it might be thought to refer to the creation of
him in the image and likeness of God; but as it must be understood of
the human nature of Christ, it may regard the wonderful union of it to
the Son of God, on account of which it is called by the same name, [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md); and so made but a little lower
than God, being next unto him, and in so near an union with a divine
Person; and which union is hypostatical or personal, the human nature
being taken into a personal union with the Son of God: and so these
words give an instance of God's marvellous regard to it; and contain a
reason, proving that he has been mindful of it, and visited it. Though
rather this clause refers to the humiliation of Christ in his human
nature, as it is interpreted in [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md); and so it removes an objection,
as it is connected with the following clause, which might be made
against what had been observed in [Psa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004.md), on account of the low estate of
Christ's human nature, when here on the earth; and the sense is, that
God has been mindful of it, and visited it, notwithstanding its state of
humiliation for a little while, seeing he has crowned it with glory and
honour, &c. Christ was made low as to nature, place, estate, reputation,
and life; he who was the most high God, in the form of God, and equal to
him in the divine nature, was made frail mortal flesh, and was in the
form of a servant in the human nature. He who dwelt on high, and lay in
the bosom of his Father, descended into the lower parts of the earth,
was formed in the womb of a virgin, and when born was laid in a manager,
and dwelt and conversed with sinful mortal men upon earth: he who was
Lord of all, whose is the earth, and the fulness of it, had not where to
lay his head: he whose glory was the glory of the only begotten of the
Father, became a worm and no man in the esteem of men, was despised and
rejected of men, and was of no reputation: and he who was the Lord of
life and glory was crucified and killed; becoming obedient to death,
even the death of the cross. Such is the nature of Christ's humiliation,
expressed by being "made low"; the degree of it is, "lower than Elohim",
than God: he was equal to him in the divine nature, but inferior to him
in the human nature, [Joh 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028.md). As
Mediator he was the servant of God, and the servant is not greater than
his master; nor as such so great: and he was in his low estate in such a
condition as to need the help and assistance of God, which he had in the
day of salvation: and especially he was lower when he, was deserted by
him, [Mat 27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md). Agreeably to which,
some render the words, as they will bear to be rendered, "thou didst
make him want God", or "didst deprive", or "bereave him of God" (i);
that is, of the gracious presence of God: and so Christ was made lower
than God in nature, office, and condition. Sometimes the word "Elohim"
is used for civil magistrates, as in [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md); because they are in God's stead,
and represent him; and, on account of their majesty, authority, and
power, bear some resemblance to him. Now Christ was made lower than
they, inasmuch as he not only taught obedience to them, but obeyed them
himself, was a servant of rulers, paid tribute to them, and suffered
himself to be examined, tried, judged, and condemned by them; but since
the word is rendered "angels" by the Chaldee paraphrase, the Septuagint
interpreters, the Jewish commentators, Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Kimchi, and
Ben Melech, and in the Arabic, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, and above
all by the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, it is best to interpret
it of them: and Christ was made lower than they by assuming human
nature, which is inferior to theirs, especially in the corporeal part of
it; and more so, inasmuch as it was attended with infirmities, and
subject to sorrows and griefs; and as it was sometimes reduced to great
extremes, and to want the comforts of life; and sometimes was in such
distress as to need the assistance and ministration of angels, which it
had, [Mat 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#011.md); and particularly it
was lower than they when deserted by God, whose face they always behold.
To which may be added, that Christ was made under, a law given by the
disposition of angels, ordained by them, and is called "the word" spoken
by them; some parts of which they are not subject to; but the particular
instance the apostle observes is suffering of death, [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md); which angels are not liable to,
they die not. The duration of this low estate was "a little while"; for
so the Hebrew word may be rendered, as it is in [Psa
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010.md), and the Greek , used by the
Septuagint, and the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, as it is in
[Act 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md); which refers either to the
time of suffering death, and lying under the power of that and the
grave, which was but a little time; or at most to the days of his flesh,
reaching from his incarnation to his resurrection; which was a course
but of a few years, and may very well be expressed in this manner. And
to this low estate was Christ brought by Jehovah the Father, who is the
person spoken of throughout the psalm; he preordained him to it,
prepared a body for him, sent him in the fulness of time, made of a
woman, made under the law, and had a very great hand in his sufferings
and death: though all was with Christ's full consent, and with his free
good will;

and hast crowned him with glory and honour; by raising him from the
dead, and setting him at his own right hand, committing all judgment to
him; and requiring all creatures, angels and men, to give worship and
adoration to him. And this being in consequence of his sufferings, after
he had run the race, and endured a fight of afflictions; and because of
the greatness of his glory and honour, with which he was as it were on
all sides surrounded, he is said to be "crowned" with it; who a little
before was crowned with thorns, and encompassed with the terrors of
death and hell. This respects his mediatorial glory.

[Psalms 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 8:6</span></span>

Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands,.... All
power in heaven and in earth being given to him: when he was raised from
the dead, and when he ascended on high, and was set down at the right
hand of God, he was made or declared Lord and Christ; Lord of the hosts
of heaven, of all the angels there, King of saints, King of kings, and
Lord of lords. All things in heaven and earth, which God has made, are
put into his hands, to subserve his cause and glory, and for the good of
his people; for he is head over all things to the church. The Ethiopic
version reads, "all the works of thy hands"; among whom are angels. This
is a greater dominion than was given to the first man, Adam, [Gen
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#025.md);

thou hast put all things under his feet; or put them in subjection to
him, as the phrase signifies, and as it is interpreted, [Heb
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008.md). Good angels are subject to him,
as appears by their ministration to him, their dependence on him, and
adoration of him, [Pe1 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022.md); devils
are subject to him, whether they will or not; and so are wicked men,
whose power and wrath he is able to restrain, and does; and the church
is subject to Christ, as her head; and so all good men, willingly and
heartily, and from a principle of love, obey his commands: yea, all
creatures in the earth, air, and sea, are in subjection to him; an
enumeration of which is given in the following verses.

[Psalms 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 8:7</span></span>

All sheep and oxen,.... The tame creatures, which are useful for food
and clothing:

yea, and the beasts of the field; the wild beasts, which he can make use
of to destroy and devour his enemies, and whom he can restrain from
harming his own people, [Jer 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 8:8</span></span>

The fowl of the air,.... These he rained about the tents of the
Israelites for their relief, [Psa
78:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#027.md), and can command them to feed
his people, as the ravens did Elijah, [Kg1
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#004.md); or to destroy his enemies, [Jer
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003.md); see [Psa
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#010.md);

and the fish of the sea: instances of Christ's power over them, and of
their being at his command, and for his service, may be seen in [Mat
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#027.md);

and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas: some (k)
understand this of ships, made by the wisdom and art of men, in which
they pass through the paths of the sea, and fish in the midst of it. The
Targum paraphrases it, "and leviathan, which passes through the paths of
the sea". Compare with this [Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md).
Some interpret all these things in a figurative and allegorical way; and
some of the ancients by "sheep" understood believers among the Gentiles;
by "oxen", the Jews; by "the beasts of the field", idolaters and profane
persons; "by the fowls of the air", angels; and by "the fish of the
sea", devils: but these are much better explained by Cocceius, who, by
"sheep", understands common members of the churches; by "oxen", those
that labour in the word and doctrine; by "the beasts of the field",
aliens from the city and kingdom of God; men fierce and cruel, [Isa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md); by "the fowl of the air", such
as are tilted up with pride and vanity; and by "the fish of the sea",
such as are immersed in worldly pleasures. But it is best to interpret
the whole literally; from whence may be observed, that what was lost by
the first Adam is restored by the second; and that believers have a free
use of all the creatures through Christ: and not only the things here
mentioned are subject to him, but everything else; there is nothing left
that is not put under him, only he is excepted that put all things under
him, [Heb 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008.md).

O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! The psalm
ends with the same words with which it begins; which shows that the
sense of this, with which the psalmist was affected, continued with him,
and doubtless increased, after such a confirmation of it, by the
instances he was led to take notice of. See Gill on [Psa
