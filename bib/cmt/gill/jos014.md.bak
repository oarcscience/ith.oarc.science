### [Joshua Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 14:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO JOSHUA 14

This chapter proceeds to give an account of the countries divided to the
children of Israel in the land of Canaan, [Jos
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md); but previous to that division
relates the claim of Caleb to Hebron, through a promise made unto him by
Moses forty five years ago, upon his report of the good land, whither he
was sent a spy by him, [Jos 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md); and
the grant which Joshua made of it to him, with his blessing, [Jos
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#013.md).

[Joshua 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 14:3</span></span>

And Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes, and an half tribe, on
the other side Jordan,.... The two tribes of Gad and Reuben, and the
half tribe of Manasseh, whose inheritance is described in [Jos
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008.md),

but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them; this is
frequently observed, that it might be taken notice of, to show the
disinterestedness of Moses in this affair, Levi being his own tribe; and
to recommend the care of the Levites to the other tribes, according to
the provision God had made for them.

[Joshua 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 14:4</span></span>

For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim,....
For the birthright being forfeited by Reuben, was given to Joseph, who
had the double portion, the privilege of the firstborn; by which means
the number of the twelve tribes was kept up in the division of the land,
though that of Levi had no share in it; and which is also a reason why
they had none, that Joseph's two sons might be reckoned two tribes:

therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land; to make way
for the sons of Joseph to have the double portion:

save cities to dwell in; and that only, for they might not sell them, as
other Israelites could theirs:

with their suburbs, for their cattle, and for their substance; the
Targum is,

"for all their beasts, and for their cattle;''that is, for convenient
places to put them into, and for pasturage for, them; which Kimchi and
Ben Melech interpret of their larger and lesser cattle, their herds and
their flocks, their oxen and sheep.

[Joshua 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 14:5</span></span>

As the Lord commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did,....
Particularly with respect to the division of the land, and making
provision for the Levites; this they did by their heads and
representatives, the high priest and chief ruler, and the princes of the
several tribes:

and they divided the land; met about it, and began to take measures in
order to do it; they prepared for it, though as yet it was not actually
done, and previous to it was the following incident.

[Joshua 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 14:6</span></span>

Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal,.... Whither he
was returned after the conquest of the kings and their kingdoms; these
were not the whole tribe of Judah, but some of the chief men of it who
accompanied Caleb, for the honour of him, as Ben Gersom observes, he
being their prince; and to second his petition, and to show their
consent unto, and an approbation of such an assignment to him as he
desired:

and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, said unto him; whether
Caleb or Jephunneh called the Kenezite, and what the reason of the name,
are not very material; and of which See Gill on [Num
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#012.md); and as Caleb was personally and
singly concerned in the following affair, he alone dressed Joshua,
attended with some principal men of his tribe:

thou knowest the thing the Lord said unto Moses the man of God,

concerning thee and me, in Kadeshbarnea; the place from whence the spies
were sent, and whither they returned to Moses there, of whom Caleb
speaks with great respect and veneration, which he knew would be very
pleasing and endearing to Joshua, who could not but remember what had
been said by him concerning himself and Caleb, though it was now forty
five years ago; it being so very striking and memorable, that only two
of that generation then present should enter into the land of Canaan;
the fulfilment of which, in all its circumstances, they had lived to
see.

[Joshua 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 14:7</span></span>

Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from
Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land,.... Not he alone, but eleven more
with him, one out of every tribe; his age he mentions, and of which, or
near it, it is highly probable the rest of the spies were, to show that
he and they were in the prime of their days, both as to bodily strength
and intellectual capacity, which were requisite for such service as to
spy out the land, of what quality that and its inhabitants were; and
Moses he calls the servant of the Lord, because it was by the order and
appointment of God, signified to Moses, that this was done; and the
place from whence they were sent forth is named, which ascertains what
that Kadesh was, where Israel was encamped when the spies were sent,
[Num 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026.md),

and I brought him word again, as it was in mine heart; that is, he gave
to Moses upon his return a sincere, honest and faithful representation
of the land, and its inhabitants, as it appeared to him.

[Joshua 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 14:8</span></span>

Nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me,.... Meaning the rest of
the spies, excepting Joshua, that went up with him into the land of
Canaan to spy it, which they might be properly said to do, since they
went up a hill or mountain, in order to go into it, [Num
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md),

made the heart of the people melt; discouraged them, filled them with
fears, sunk their spirits, that their hearts flowed, and became as weak
as water, having no strength left in them, or hope of possessing the
land; being told what stout and gigantic men the inhabitants of it were,
and how strongly fortified were their cities:

but I wholly followed the Lord my God; and did not join with them in an
ill report of the good land; but having the fear of God before his eyes,
walked after that, and delivered in his report faithfully, according to
the dictates of his conscience, and the real sentiments of his mind; of
this phrase; see Gill on [Num 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024.md).

[Joshua 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 14:9</span></span>

And Moses sware on that day, saying,.... Or declared the oath of the
Lord, for it was the Lord that sware to what follows; see [Deu
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#034.md),

surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine
inheritance, and thy children's for ever: not the whole land of Canaan,
nor all the parts of it Caleb travelled through, but particularly
Hebron; which though not expressly mentioned in the aforesaid oath, yet
was understood and known to be the meaning of it, and which Joshua by
the following grant owned, and it is elsewhere expressly affirmed, [Jdg
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#020.md); and it is remarked, that it is
not said "they", but "he" came to Hebron, [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md); that is Caleb, so that it was
literally true that his feet had trodden there: now the reason of this
oath, and the inheritance assured by it to Caleb, was:

because thou hast wholly followed the Lord thy God; in all his ways, and
with full purpose of heart, and particularly had acted the upright and
faithful part in the report he made of the good land; See Gill on [Num
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024.md).

[Joshua 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 14:10</span></span>

And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said,.... Had upheld
him in life, and preserved him from many dangers in the wilderness; and
had continued him not only in life, but in health to that day, according
to his promise to him, that he would bring him into the land of Canaan,
and that he should see and possess it, [Num
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024.md) [Deu
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#036.md),

these forty and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto
Moses, and while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness; not
that the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness forty five
years, but it was while they were in the wilderness this word or
promise, concerning Caleb, was spoken by the Lord to Moses; and it was
in the second year of their coming out of Egypt, after which they
wandered in the wilderness thirty eight years, so that they had now been
in the land of Canaan seven years; and from hence the Jewish
chronologers (s) gather, that the land was seven years in subduing, and
which their commentators in general take notice of. Maimonides (t) seems
to be displeased with the Arabs for calling the wilderness, through
which the Israelites travelled, "the desert of wandering"; but it
appears from hence to be a very proper epithet of it; and Kadesh the
place where they were first threatened, that they should be wanderers in
the wilderness for such a time, had the additional name of Barnea, which
signifies the son of a wanderer:

and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old; being forty
years of age when sent a spy into the land, [Jos
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#007.md); thirty eight years he was with
Israel in the wilderness, and seven years more since they entered into
the land, in all eighty five; there is no necessity of understanding it
that this was his precise birth day, but that about this time, or that
he was now completely of such an age, which was more by fifteen years
than the age of man in common at that time, see [Psa
90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010.md).

[Joshua 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 14:11</span></span>

As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent
me,.... To spy the land, forty five years ago; suggesting that he was as
sound in his mind, understanding, judgment and memory, and as hale,
strong, and robust in his body now, as he had been so long ago; which
was a wonderful instance of the care of divine Providence over him in
upholding him in life, and continuing him in vigour and health at such
an age, when the carcasses of so many thousands had pined away and fell
in the wilderness:

as my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war; he had the
same strength of body and courage of mind to engage in warlike
enterprises as he had so many years ago; and this he the rather
mentions, to prevent any objection Joshua might make to the giving of
Hebron to him, since being inhabited by giants, it required a large
share of strength and courage to attempt the conquest of it: but Caleb
had strength

both to go out, and to come in; to do any civil business, to preside
over his tribe, or to govern any city, and its appendages, that should
be put into his hands.

[Joshua 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 14:12</span></span>

Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord spake in that
day,.... The mountainous part of the country, the hill country of Judea,
in which Hebron, Debir, and other cities were; for it was not one
particular city only that Caleb requested, but a large tract of ground:

for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the
cities were great and fenced; that the giants, called Anakims, dwelt in
the mountainous country, and their cities, Hebron, Debir, and Anab, were
very large, and well fortified; this Joshua heard at the time the spies
were sent into the land, he being one of them; and this he heard, not
from the report of the spies, but from the people of the country, and
therefore must know that to conquer these men, and subdue their cities,
was an arduous undertaking; but since he had strength and courage, he
hoped his request would be granted:

if so be the Lord will be with me; which he spake not as doubting of his
presence and power to be with him, and assist him, but as placing his
confidence therein, and, distrusting his own power and ability, having
no dependence or that, but believing that the Lord, or, as the Targum,
the Word of the Lord, would be with him for his help:

then, says Caleb:

I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said; that is, to drive
the Anakims out of their cities, or out of the mountains, the caves and
dens there, to which they betook themselves, since the taking of Hebron,
Debir, and Anab, by Joshua, [Jos
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#022.md); and he relied upon the promise
of God to enable him to do this, and not upon his natural strength and
courage, or the number and prowess of the warlike tribe of Judah, of
which he was prince.

[Joshua 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 14:13</span></span>

And Joshua blessed him,.... By granting him his request, congratulating
him upon it, and praying for and wishing him success in his attempt to
drive out the giants, and possess their country:

and gave unto Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, Hebron for an inheritance;
being satisfied of the justness of his suit, of its being the will of
God, and the order of Moses, that he should have this for an
inheritance, which he had heard himself, had knowledge of, and well
remembered: this is to be understood not of the city of Hebron itself,
for that was given to the Levites, and was a city of refuge, but the
country round about in the fields and villages annexed to it, as appears
from [Jos 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#012.md).

[Joshua 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 14:14</span></span>

Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh
the Kenezite unto this day,.... The time of the writing of this book:

because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel; as in [Jos
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#008.md); Hebron signifies fellowship or
communion; and this in a spiritual sense is very desirable by all the
people of God, as Hebron was by Caleb, even communion with God, Father,
Son and Spirit, with angels and saints, both now and hereafter; and they
are willing to engage with their spiritual enemies in the name and
strength of Christ, though ever so potent, may they but enjoy this
blessing, and which is more or less granted, to all the hearty, sincere,
and faithful followers of Christ; see [Joh
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021.md).

[Joshua 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 14:15</span></span>

And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba,.... According to Jerom
(u), it had its name of Hebron from a son or grandson of Caleb of that
name, [Ch1 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042.md); and if so, then it is
here, and in some other places, so called by anticipation: Kirjatharba
may be rendered "the city of the four"; and had its name, as some think,
from the four couple buried there, or near it, Adam and Eve, Abraham and
Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah; or from four eminent persons,
who formerly dwelt there, Aner, Eshcol, Mamre, and Abraham; or rather
from four persons that more lately dwelt there, Anak and his three sons,
Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai; or Arba is the name of some great man, to
whom this city belonged, and so was called the city of Arba, which is
the sense of our version, as appears by the following supplement:

which Arba was a great man among the Anakims; both in stature and in
dignity, and in authority, which some take to be Anak himself, the
father of the Anakims; so Jarchi and Kimchi:

and the land had rest from war; as is observed in [Jos
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#023.md); after Joshua had finished his
conquest; and here again it is remarked just before the division of the
land, as being now a proper time for it.

\(u\) De loc. Heb. fol. 87. F.

[Joshua 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 14:1</span></span>

And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in
the land of Canaan,.... Of which an exact account is given in the
following chapters, particularly in the [Jos
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md),

which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of
the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for an
inheritance unto them; namely, ten princes, one of each tribe, who, with
Eleazar and Joshua, were appointed of the Lord by name to do this
business, even seven years ago, before their entrance into the land of
Canaan, [Num 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#017.md).

[Joshua 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 14:2</span></span>

By lot was their inheritance,.... Every tribe had its part and portion
assigned to it, by the casting of lots; which was done to prevent any
future quarrels, animosities and strifes among the tribes, the
disposition being of the Lord; and to show the exact agreement between
the lot and the divine predictions by Jacob and Moses; and to make it
appear that the division of the land was not owing to the private
combination of the above men, and their private settlement of it; but to
the providence of God, the directors of the lot; their chief business
was to see that the lot was executed in a faithful manner, and that
every tribe had its allotment according to it. In this Canaan was a type
of the heavenly inheritance, which the saints obtain by lot, in and
through Christ, the antitypical Joshua, [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md),

as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, [Num
26:55](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#055.md),

for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe; see [Jos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007.md); the reason why this number of
them is particularly mentioned follows.
