INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 4

To the chief Musician on Neginoth, a Psalm of David. This psalm is
inscribed "to the chief musician", or "conqueror" (d): who excelled
others in the art of music, and carried the glory from them; who was
very skilful, and instructed others in it, and was the master of the
song, as Chenaniah, [Ch1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#022.md); who
set the tune, led on the psalm, and had the whole direction and
management of it; and so the Jewish doctors (d) generally understand it
of one that presided over the rest of the musicians and singers; and to
such an one was this psalm sent, to be sung in public worship: for the
psalms of David were not composed for private use only, but for public
service; and were committed into the hands and care of the chief of the
singers, as Asaph and others; see [Ch1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007.md); by whom they were preserved and
transmitted to future ages for the use of the church, not only in the
former but in the present dispensation. The Septuagint interpreters, and
after them the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, render it "unto the
end", or for ever; to this agrees the sense of R. Saadiah Gaon (e), who
says,

"this is a psalm of David, who gave it to one of the singers to sing it
continually,''

as if it was "for ever"; but the former sense is best, to understand it
of the chief musician, or precentor, who is said to be "on neginoth":
the singular; "neginah", is used in the title of [Psa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md), and it is sometimes rendered "a
song", as in [Job 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#009.md); hence the
Vulgate Latin version here renders it "in songs"; and the Septuagint
renders it "in psalms"; and then the meaning is, that this person was
the chief man that presided over the songs and psalms: though the Jewish
writers (f), for the most part, interpret it of a musical instrument so
called; not such an one as was blown, as the pipe and trumpet, but what
was played upon with the hand; see [Sa1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#016.md); a stringed instrument, which
was touched with the fingers as an harp, or struck with a quill or bow
as a violin. And as there were various instruments of music used in the
temple service, so there were persons set over them, some over one sort,
and some over another; and this man presided over the instruments that
were played with the hand: and it looks as if this psalm was to be sung
to such an instrument, by its being inscribed and sent to him. Aben Ezra
takes the word to be, "the beginning of a song"; and the Targum renders
the whole, "to sing upon the chorus" or "dances". It is called "a Psalm
of David", being written by him, under the inspiration of the Spirit of
God; the occasion of it was Absalom's rebellion; and it was written when
he fled from him, as the preceding, as Kimchi thinks; but, according to
Lightfoot and others, it was the rebellion of Sheba, [Sa2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001.md), though others refer it to the
time of his distresses and persecutions by Saul; according to the Jewish
Rabbins (g), where there are the words , as they are both in this title,
the psalm belongs to future time, to the world to come, to the times of
the Messiah.

[Psalms 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 4:1</span></span>

Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness,.... Or, "my righteous
God" (h), who is righteous in his nature, ways, and works, the just
Judge of the whole earth, who will do right; or "the vindicator of my
righteousness", as the Syriac version renders it; that is, of his
innocence and uprightness, which the Lord knew and was a witness of: and
since he was his covenant God, he doubted not but he would bring it
forth as the light, and favour his righteous cause, and do him justice
upon his enemies: or the psalmist addresses God in this manner, because
he was the author of his righteousness, and was the justifier of him, by
imputing the righteousness of his Son unto him. So Christ addresses his
Father, [Joh 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#026.md); who he knew would
justify him, and by whom he was justified as the surety of his people,
when he, rose from the dead: and so the saints can draw nigh to God the
Judge of all, through the righteousness of Christ; knowing that he is
just, and the justifier of him that believes in Jesus; and that he is
just and faithful to forgive their sins, and cleanse them from all
unrighteousness, on account of his blood. The petition put up by the
psalmist is, to be heard when he called, that is, to hear his prayer, as
it is explained in the latter part of the verse: and God is a God
hearing prayer; and so David, Christ, and all the saints, have found him
to be: and the encouragement to pray to the Lord, in hope of being
heard, arose from past experience of divine goodness;

thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; when he had like to have
been killed by Saul casting a javelin at him; and when his house was
watched by men that Saul set there, and he was let down through a window
and escaped; and when he was shut in at Keilah, where Saul thought he
had him safe; and at other times, to which he may here refer, as in [Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md); and this may be applied to the
Messiah, when in the garden, beset with sorrows, and an angel
strengthened him; and when on the cross, surrounded by various enemies,
whom he conquered; and when in death and the grave, from the pains and
cords of which he was loosed, and set in a large place. And this agrees
also with the experience of the saints; who, when in distress through
sin, Satan, and the law, have been set free, through the Gospel
proclaiming liberty to the captives to such enemies; and the opening of
the prison to them that have been bound by them: and when they have been
so shut up and straitened in themselves, that they could not come forth
in the discharge of duty, and in the exercise of grace; through the
Spirit of the Lord, who is a spirit of liberty, they have been enlarged
in the duty of prayer and of praise, and in the exercise of faith and
love; and their hearts have been enlarged through the discoveries of the
love of God towards them, so that they have run cheerfully in the ways
of his commandments; who also gives them largeness of heart, an increase
of the knowledge of Christ, and of the love of God, and tills them with
joy and peace in believing, and draws out the desires of their souls to
his name, and the remembrance of him;

have mercy upon me: the psalmist pleads no merit nor worthiness of his
own, but applies to the grace and mercy of God; and sensible of his sin,
both original and actual, he entreats a discovery of pardoning grace and
mercy. The words may be rendered, "be gracious unto me" (i), or "show me
favour"; bestow the blessings of grace, grant larger measures of grace,
and fresh supplies of it: and so all sensible sinners apply to God for
mercy; and all the saints have recourse to him as the Father of mercies,
and the God of all comfort, for every mercy, both temporal and
spiritual. Nor is this unsuitable to the Messiah, as man and Mediator;
with whom, God keeps his mercy for evermore, as the head and surety of
his people, and upon whom, as man, the grace of God was; and who
increased, as in stature, so in favour with God and man; and which, no
doubt, was desirable by him;

and hear my prayer: the same petition with that in the beginning of the
verse; invocation and prayer being the same thing.

[Psalms 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 4:2</span></span>

O ye sons of men,.... Meaning great men, the nobles of Israel; and so
the Jewish interpreters (k) generally explain it; such as Ahithophel,
and others, who were in the conspiracy with Absalom, [Sa2
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012.md), and so they were the kings and
princes of the earth, and the rulers of the Jewish sanhedrim, the chief
priests and elders, who were the enemies of Christ; and such, generally
speaking, have been the persecutors of the saints; these men of power
and authority, of dignity and honour, and who were in high places, and
boasted of their titles and grandeur, the psalmist addresses by way of
expostulation in the following words;

how long will ye turn my glory into shame? Meaning either God, who was
his glory, [Psa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md); whom they
reproached when they said there was no help for him in him; or his
tongue, the instrument of praise, and the songs of praise he expressed
by it, [Psa 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#008.md); which they jeered and
scoffed at: or rather his royal glory and majesty, which they attempted
to vail by casting him down from his excellency, by dethroning him, and
setting up Absalom in his room. So the Jews endeavoured to turn the
glory of Christ into shame, which lay in his being the only begotten of
the Father; by denying his sonship, by condemning him to death; because
he said he was the Son of God; and by mocking at him under that
character on the cross; and also by their spitting upon, buffeting, and
crucifying the Lord of glory; by reproaching his Gospel, ministers, and
people; and by not acknowledging him as the Messiah, and submitting to
his righteousness. And wicked men do as much as in them lies to turn the
glory of the saints into shame, by aspersing their character, taking
away their good name and reputation among men; by reproaching and
reviling them, and speaking all manner of evil of them; and by
persecuting them in the most violent manner;

how long will ye love vanity; or "a vain thing" (l). Such as the placing
of Absalom upon the throne, on which their hearts were set; and such was
the vain imagination of the Jews, with which they pleased themselves,
that Jesus should die, and his name perish; and such are all the
attempts of wicked men to ruin and destroy the people and interest of
Christ; for no weapon formed against them shall prosper;

and seek after leasing? Or "a lie" (m); or that which fails and
deceives, as a lie does: and such were all the counsels and designs of
the great men of Israel against David: and so the Jews may be said to
seek after a lie, when they seek after another Messiah besides Jesus of
Nazareth: for every other proves a "Bar Cozbi", that is, the son of a
lie; as the false Messiah in Adrian's time was called by themselves. And
so do all such as seek after and embrace false doctrines, errors, and
heresies, and are given up to believe them. Now the psalmist suggests
that these great men were obstinate, and continued in these sinful
practices; and that in the issue all their efforts would be vain and
fruitless; and which he further strengthens by observing to them what
follows.

3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 4:3</span></span>

But know,.... Take notice of it, consider it, be assured of the truth,
of it; it may be depended upon as fact,

that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself: which may be
understood of David himself, an holy good man; a man after God's own
heart; whom the Lord chose, and in a marvellous manner separated from
the rest of his brethren; took him from the sheepfold, and set him upon
the throne of Israel, for the glory of his great name; and therefore the
attempts of his enemies against him would be without success: and also
of the Messiah, God's Holy One, whom he has chosen out from among the
people to be their Saviour and Redeemer, to the glory of his grace;
wherefore the work of the Lord has prospered in his hands: and likewise
of all the saints, and of their election; which act is expressed by
their being set apart, or separated from others, who are called the
rest; and which is a marvellous act of grace: for the word may be
rendered, "he hath wonderfully set apart" (n). It is an amazing instance
of grace that God should make one to differ from another, and separate
them from their mother's womb, and call them by his grace. The object of
this act is "him that is godly", or "holy" (o): not that any are set
apart or chosen by God for their godliness, or holiness; for they are
chosen through sanctification of the Spirit, and not because they were
or it was foreseen they would be holy. Holiness, faith, godliness, and
good works, are the fruits of election, and not the causes of it: but
the word rendered "godly", signifies "good" and "merciful" (p); and
designs one, that God is good, and gracious, and merciful unto; who is
an object of his free grace and favour; and therefore he chooses and
sets him apart of his own grace and mercy, and according to his
sovereign will and pleasure: and that "for himself"; for his own use and
service, for his praise and honour, and to the glory of his grace; which
is his grand end in predestination, election, and in all spiritual
blessings. And now all attempts against such persons are in vain; all
charges against them are of no avail; all methods, whether by open force
of persecutors, or by the cunning of false teachers, that lie in wait to
deceive, to prevail against them, prove failures: and God will avenge
his elect, that cry unto him day and night; as follows;

the Lord will hear when I call unto him; and deliver out of the hands of
enemies, and cut them off: wherefore it is a vain thing for men to set
themselves against Christ and his people.

[Psalms 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 4:4</span></span>

Stand in awe, and sin not,.... That is, stand in awe of God, and his
righteous, judgments; be afraid of him, and tremble before him; make him
your fear and your dread, and go on no longer and proceed no further in
sinning against him. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and
Ethiopic versions, render it, "be ye angry, and sin not": which are the
words of the apostle, [Eph 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026.md);
referring to this place; and which doubtless is the reason of these
versions. There is an anger that is sinful, when it is without a cause,
or exceeds due bounds, and is not directed to a good end, and is
productive of bad effects, by words or deeds; and when it is soon
raised, or long continued; and there is an anger that is not sinful;
when it arises from a true zeal for God and religion; when it is
kindled, not against the persons, but sins, of men; and when it is
continued to answer good purposes; as the good of those with whom we are
angry, and the glory of God, and the promoting of the kingdom and
interest of Christ;

commune with your own heart upon your bed: when retired from men and
business, and you are at leisure to think and meditate then reflect upon
your actions, seriously consider them; ask your heart some proper and
close questions; examine narrowly and thoroughly the principles on
which, and the views with which, you act;

and be still; cease from all your rage and fury against me, against the
Lord, and against his people; or "say in your own hearts" (q), as
follows.

[Psalms 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 4:5</span></span>

Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,.... Offer for sacrifice things
righteously gotten, for the Lord hates robbery for burnt offering, [Isa
61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008.md). Some respect may be had to the
unrighteous acquisitions of Absalom and his men, and who were now in
possession of Jerusalem, and of the altars of the Lord, and were
sacrificing on them; in which they gloried; and to which this may be
opposed. Likewise sacrifices of righteousness are such as were according
to the law, and were offered in a right manner; which were not maimed,
nor had any blemish in them; see [Mal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013.md); and particularly such as were
offered up in the faith of the great sacrifice, Christ; for, without
faith, it is impossible to please God by any sacrifice. And this sense
is confirmed by the following clause, which requires trust in the Lord.
Moreover, righteousness, with the Jews, signifies alms, beneficence,
showing mercy to the indigent; and acts of liberality are sacrifices,
with which God is well pleased; and which are preferred by him to the
sacrifices of the ceremonial law, [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016.md). The sacrifices also of a broken
heart, and of a contrite spirit, are such as God esteems of; he looks to
those that have them, and dwells with them. And to this sense the
Chaldee paraphrase inclines, in which the words are thus paraphrased;

"subdue your corruptions, and it shall be reckoned to you as a sacrifice
of righteousness?''

and why may not the sacrifice of praise for mercies received, especially
for the righteousness of Christ, be at least included, if not
principally designed; since these are sacrifices which, under the
ceremonial law, were more pleasing to God than others; and are always
acceptable to him through Jesus Christ our Lord? Agreeably to this, Aben
Ezra thinks the peace offerings are intended, which were in a way of
thanksgiving; and are opposed to sin offerings, and trespass offerings,
and burnt offerings; from the last of which sacrifices of righteousness
are distinguished in [Psa 51:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019.md);

and put your trust in the Lord: not in your strength, in horses and
chariots, and numbers of men; nor in wise counsels, nor in riches, nor
in fleshly privileges, nor in works of righteousness, or sacrifices of
righteousness: for though they are to be performed, they are not to be
trusted in; nor in your own hearts. And while the psalmist is striking
at the false confidence of the sons of men he is addressing, he may at
the same time be thought to be encouraging those that were with him to
trust in the Lord, Jehovah, the Son of God, before spoken of by him as
the object of trust, [Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md); to
trust in his person for the acceptance of their persons and sacrifices
of righteousness; and in his righteousness for justification; in his
blood for pardon; in his sacrifice for expiation of sin; in his fulness
for daily supplies; and in his power for protection and safety. And it
is right to trust in him at all times; in times of affliction,
temptation, and desertion: he is always the same; in him is everlasting
strength; he has an heart as well as an ability to help and succour, and
none ever trusted in him and were confounded. Such have peace and
safety, and can want no good thing.

[Psalms 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 4:6</span></span>

There be many that say, who will show us any good?.... These may be
thought to be the men of the world; carnal worldly minded men, seeking
after temporal good, and taking up their rest and contentment in it; to
whom the psalmist opposes his wish and request, in the following words.
Or these are the words of the men that were along with David, wishing
themselves at home and in their families, enjoying the good things of
life they before had; or rather these are the words of the same many,
the enemies of David, spoken of in [Psa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md); who were wishing, as Kimchi
observes, that Absalom's rebellion might prosper; that David might die
and his son reign in his stead, so the evil they wished to him was good
to them: or they may be the words of the same men, expressing the
desperate condition that David and his friends were in, which the
psalmist represents in this manner, "who will show us any good?" none,
say they, will show them any good, neither God nor man; there is no help
for him in God; he and his friends must unavoidably perish: and this
produces the following petition,

Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us; meaning his
gracious presence, the manifestations of himself, the discoveries of his
love, communion with him, the comforts of his Spirit, and the joys of
his salvation; suggesting that in the enjoyment of these things lay
their good and happiness, and their safety also; his face and favour,
love and grace, being as a shield to encompass them, and as a banner
over them, [Psa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012.md); and so Jarchi
observes, that the word here used signifies to lift up for a banner (r);
so, me respect seems to be had to the form of the priests blessing, [Num
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024.md); and the words are opposed to the
good desired by carnal men, and express the true happiness of the
saints, [Psa 89:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015.md); this is a blessing
wished for not only by David, but by his antitype the Messiah, [Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md); and by all believers.

\(r\) So Gussetius, Ebr. Comment. p. 515, 518.

[Psalms 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 4:7</span></span>

Thou hast put gladness in my heart,.... The Ethiopic version reads it
"into our heart"; in granting the above request; for, nothing so
rejoices the hearts of God's people as the light of his countenance, or
the enjoyment of his gracious presence: this was matter of exceeding joy
to Christ himself, [Psa 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md); and so
it is to all his members; this causes inward gladness, gladness of
heart, and is opposed to the external rejoicings of wicked men and of
hypocrites: and this is of God's putting into the heart; and indeed none
can put gladness either into a wounded conscience, into the heart of a
sensible sinner, or into the soul of one that is panting after the
presence of God, and communion with him, but God himself;

more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased: meaning
the time of harvest and of vintage; when there is a good harvest, and a
good vintage, there is joy among men, and the contrary when it is
otherwise, [Isa 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003.md); these things
being of general use, spread an universal joy among people; there is
scarce any earthly thing that occasions more joy than these do: and yet
the joy on such occasions is not to be compared with spiritual joy, that
is a joy unspeakable and full of glory. Some take the to be not
comparative, but causal, and render the words (s), "thou hast put
gladness in ray heart from the time that their corn", &c. as do the
Chaldee paraphrase and Syriac versions; and the Arabic version renders
it, "because of the multitude of fruits", &c. and then the sense is, as
if David should say concerning his enemies,

"I never envied their prosperity, I always rejoiced when they had a good
harvest, or vintage, and still do; and yet they have rose up and
rebelled against me, and requited me evil for good.''

And this sense is given into by the Jewish commentators (t), and shows
of what an admirable spirit, and in what a sweet disposition of mind,
the psalmist was; that while his enemies were seeking his life he was
rejoicing in their prosperity; and is a sad aggravation of their
wickedness: and this may also be understood of the rejoicing of David,
and even of the Messiah, and likewise of all good men, at the spiritual
prosperity of the saints, at any increase of grace, spiritual knowledge,
and joy, signified by these outward things, as in [Jer
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#012.md); the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin,
Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, add "oil" to corn and wine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 4:8</span></span>

I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep,.... Signifying, that he had
such a calmness and serenity of mind, amidst all his troubles, that he
could not only lay himself down in great peace, and much composure of
mind, but sleep also, and that as soon as laid down almost; some lay
themselves down, but cannot sleep, through the anxiety of their minds;
but the psalmist could do both: or the word rendered "both" may he
translated "together" (u); and the sense be either that he would lie
down and sleep together with his friends, committing himself and them to
the care and protection of God; or that he should lie down and sleep
together with his enemies; meaning that he was assured that there would
quickly be a reconciliation and peace between them; see [Pro
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007.md);

for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety; suggesting that his
protection and safety were owing to the power and presence of God only;
and that was the reason of the tranquillity of his mind, and why he
slept so quietly in the night watches, though in such danger from his
enemies; or "thou, Lord, makest me only" or "alone" (w), being solitary
and destitute of friends, to dwell in safety; finder the shadow of thy
wings, encompassed by thy favour, and surrounded by thy power; see [Deu
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md).
