INTRODUCTION TO MALACHI 3

This chapter begins with a prophecy of John the Baptist, the forerunner
of Christ; and of the coming of Christ, and the effects and consequences
of it, with respect both to the righteous and the wicked; and it
contains accusations and charges of sin against the Jews, intermixed
with exhortations to repentance. John the Baptist is promised to be
sent, and is described by his office as a messenger, and by his work, to
prepare the way of the Lord; and the Messiah is prophesied of, who is
described by his characters; with respect to himself, the Lord and
Messenger of the covenant; with respect to the truly godly among the
Jews, as the object of their desire and delight; whose coming is spoken
of as a certain thing, and which would be sudden; and the place is
mentioned he should come into, [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md) and this his coming is represented
as terrible to the wicked, and as trying and purifying to the righteous,
expressed by the various similes of a refiner's fire, and fuller's soap;
and the end answered by it, their offering a righteous offering to the
Lord, [Mal 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md) but with respect to the
wicked, he declares he should be a swift witness against them, whose
characters are particularly given, and this assured from his
immutability; the consequence of which to the saints is good, being
their security from destruction, [Mal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005.md) and next a charge is commenced
against the wicked Jews, as that in general they had for a long time
revolted from the Lord, and were guilty of sins of omission and
commission, and are therefore exhorted to return to the Lord, with a
promise that he will return to them, and yet they refuse, [Mal
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007.md) and, in particular, that they were
guilty of sacrilege, and so accounted, even the whole nation, in
withholding tithes and sacrifices, which they are exhorted to bring in;
to which they are encouraged with promises of blessings of prosperity
and protection, [Mal 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008.md) and that they
had spoken impudent and blasphemous words against the Lord; which,
though excepted to, is proved by producing their own words, [Mal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#013.md) and by the contrary behaviour of
those that feared the Lord, who were taken notice of by him, and were
dear unto him, [Mal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016.md) wherefore it
is suggested, that the time would come when there would be a manifest
difference made between the one and the other, [Mal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#018.md).

[Malachi 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 3:1</span></span>

Behold, I will send my messenger,.... These are the words of Christ, in
answer to the question put in the last verse of the preceding chapter
[Mal 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017.md), "Where is the God of
judgment?" intimating that he would quickly appear, and previous to his
coming send his messenger or angel; not the angel of death to destroy
the wicked, as Jarchi thinks; nor an angel from heaven, as Kimchi; nor
Messiah the son of Joseph; as Aben Ezra; nor the Prophet Malachi
himself, as Abarbinel; but the same that is called Elijah the prophet,
[Mal 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md) and is no other than John the
Baptist, as is clear from [Mat 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010.md)
called a "messenger" or "angel", not by nature, but by office; and
Christ's messenger, because sent by him and on his errand; and which
shows the power and authority of Christ in sending forth ministers; his
superior excellency to John, and his existence before him, or he could
not be sent by him, and so before his incarnation; for John was sent by
him before he was in the flesh, and consequently this is a proof of the
proper deity of Christ: and the word "behold" is prefixed to this, in
order to raise the attention of those that put the above question, and
all others; as well as to show that the message John was sent upon was
of the greatest moment and importance; as that the Messiah was just
ready to appear, his kingdom was at hand, and the Jews ought to believe
in him; though it also respects the coming of the Messiah, spoken of in
the latter part of the text:

and he shall prepare the way before me; by declaring to the Jews that he
was born, and was in the midst of them; by pointing him out unto them;
by preaching the doctrine of repentance, and exhorting them to believe
in him; and by administering the ordinance of baptism in general to all
proper subjects, and in particular to Christ, by which he was made
manifest to Israel; See Gill on [Mar
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002.md) the allusion is to kings and great
men sending persons before them when on a journey, to give notice of
their coming, and provide for them:

and the Lord, whom ye seek; this is the person himself speaking, the Son
of God, and promised Messiah, the Lord of all men, and particularly of
his church and people, in right of marriage, by virtue of redemption,
and by being their Head and King; so Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it
of him, and even Abarbinel (q) himself; the Messiah that had been so
long spoken of and so much expected, and whom the Jews sought after,
either in a scoffing manner, expressed in the above question, or rather
seriously; some as a temporal deliverer, to free them from the Roman
yoke, and bring them into a state of liberty, prosperity, and grandeur;
and others as a spiritual Saviour, to deliver from sin, law, hell, and
death, and save them with an everlasting salvation:

shall suddenly come to his temple; meaning not his human nature, nor his
church, sometimes so called; but the material temple at Jerusalem, the
second temple, called "his", because devoted to his service and worship,
which proves him to be God, and because of his frequency in it; here he
was brought and presented by his parents at the proper time, for the
purification of his mother; here he was at twelve years of age disputing
with the doctors; and here Simeon, Anna, and others, were waiting for
him, [Luk 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#022.md) and we often read of
his being here, and of his using his authority in it as the Lord and
proprietor of it; and of the Hosannas given him here, [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md) the manner in which he should
come, "suddenly", may refer to the manifestation of it, quickly after
John the Baptist had prepared his way by his doctrine and baptism:

even the messenger of the covenant; not of the covenant of works with
Adam, of which there was no mediator and messenger; nor of the covenant
of circumcision, at which, according to the Jews, Elias presides; nor of
the covenant at Sinai, of which Moses was the mediator; but of the
covenant of grace, of which Christ is not only the Surety and Mediator;
but, as here, "the Messenger"; because it is revealed, made known, and
exhibited in a more glorious manner by him under the Gospel
dispensation, through the ministration of the word and ordinances. De
Dieu observes, that the word in the Ethiopic language signifies a prince
as well as a messenger, and so may be rendered, "the Prince of the
covenant", which is a way of speaking used in [Dan
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022.md),

whom ye delight in; either carnally, as they pleased themselves with the
thoughts of a temporal prince, and of great honour and grandeur under
him; and as they would have done, had he submitted to have been made a
king by them in this sense; or rather spiritually, and so is to be
understood of such who had a spiritual knowledge of him, and joy in him;
who rejoiced and delighted in the contemplation of his person, offices,
righteousness, and salvation:

he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts; this expresses the certainty of
his coming, being said by himself, who is the Lord of hosts, the Lord of
armies in heaven and in earth, the King of kings, and Lord of lords.
This passage is, in some Jewish writers (r), interpreted of the world to
come, or times of the Messiah.

\(q\) Mashmiah Jeshuah, fol. 76. 4. (r) Bemidbar Rabba, sect. 16. fol.
219. 4.

[Malachi 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 3:2</span></span>

But who may abide the day of his coming?.... When he should be manifest
in Israel, and come preaching the Gospel of the kingdom; who could bear
the doctrines delivered by him, concerning his deity and equality with
God the Father; concerning his character and mission as the Messiah, and
his kingdom not being a temporal, but a spiritual one; concerning his
giving his flesh for the life of the world, and eating that by faith;
concerning distinguishing and efficacious grace; and all such that so
severely struck at the wickedness of the Scribes and Pharisees, and
their self-righteous principles; and especially since for judgment he
came, that they might not see? nor could they bear the light of this
glorious Sun of righteousness; and he came not to send peace and outward
prosperity to the Jews, but a sword and division, [Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039.md) very few indeed could bear his
ministry, or the light of that day, it being so directly contrary to
their principles and practices:

and who shall stand when he appeareth? in his kingdom and glory, to take
vengeance on the Jews for their rejection of him and his Gospel; for
this coming and appearance of his include all the time between his
manifestation in the flesh and the destruction of Jerusalem; and so all
those sorrows and distresses which went before it, or attended it, and
were such as had never been from the creation of the world; and unless
those times had been shortened, no flesh could have been saved; see [Mat
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003.md),

for he is like a refiner's fire; partly by the ministry of the word,
compared to fire, [Jer 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md)
separating pure doctrines from ones of dross; and partly by his fiery
dispensations and judgments on the wicked Jews, when he distinguished
and saved his own people from that untoward generation, and destroyed
them:

and like fuller's soap; or "fuller's herb", as the Septuagint and
Vulgate Latin versions render it, and Jarchi interprets it: and so R.
Jonah (s) interprets it of an herb which fullers use: and in the Misna
(t) this is one of the seven things used to take out spots, namely,
"borith", the word here used; and which Maimonides (u) says is a plant
known by the name of "algasul" and "gazul" in the Arabic language: it
signifies something by which filth is washed away; and so Bartenora (w)
says it is a plant which purifies and cleanses; and Jerom (x) relates
that this herb grows in Palestine, in moist and green places, and has
the same virtue as nitre to take away filth; agreeably to which some
other versions render it "fuller's weed", or "soap weed" (y). The Syriac
version is,

"as sulphur that makes white;''

and fullers, with the Romans, were wont to make use of that along with
chalk to take out spots; and so Pliny (z) speaks of a kind of sulphur
which fullers make use of. A metaphor signifying the same thing as
before, the removing of spotted doctrines or spotted persons, the one by
the preaching of the Gospel, the other by awful judgments, as spots in
garments are removed by the fuller's herb or soap.

[Malachi 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mal 3:3</span></span>

And he shall sit as a refiner, and purifier of silver,.... Kimchi
interprets this, as he does the latter part of the preceding verse [Mal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md), of the day, and not of the Lord,
which he compares to a judge that sits and separates the guilty from the
innocent; see [Co1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md) but it is to
be understood of the Lord himself, and expresses his diligence in
sitting and separating good men and principles from bad ones, just as
silver is purified and refined from dross. Maimonides (a) understands
the passage of the Messiah; for he says,

"in the days of the King Messiah, when his kingdom is restored, and all
Israel shall be gathered to him, all will have their genealogies set
right by his mouth, through the Holy Spirit that rests upon him, as it
is said, "he shall sit a refiner and purifier":''

as a refiner sits and observes his metal while it is melting, and waits
the proper time to pour it out and separate the dross from it; so Christ
is here represented as sitting, while his people are purifying and
refining by the various ways and means he makes use of: it denotes the
continued care of Christ over them; his eye is upon them, that nothing
be lost but their dross and corruption; and his patience in waiting to
be gracious to them, and do them good; and his diligent attention to the
proper season of doing it; designing by all that he does, not their hurt
and damage, but their real good, for he saves them, though it be by
fire; and indeed every trial and affliction is for the purifying of
their souls, and the brightening of their graces, and increasing their
spiritual experience, light, and knowledge.

And he shall purify the sons of Levi; the priests, either literally
understood, some of these were converted from their evil principles and
practices, and became obedient to the doctrines of the Gospel, [Act
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md) or figuratively, the apostles of
Christ and ministers of the Gospel, who were made clean by him; or
rather all the people of God, who are made priests as well as kings, and
are a royal priesthood, and are purified by Christ, both by his blood,
and the imputation of his righteousness, by which they become without
spot and blemish, and as white as snow; and by the Spirit in
sanctification, he sprinkling clean water upon them, and purifying their
hearts by faith in the blood of Jesus; and also by afflictive
dispensations of Providence sanctified unto them. Mention is made of the
priests and Levites, because these were so very corrupt in the times of
Christ, and as appears from the preceding chapters.

And purge them as gold and silver; are purged in the fire from their
dross: this shows of what worth and value, and in what esteem the Lord's
people are to him; he reckons of them as gold and silver, and as his
peculiar treasure: and it suggests, that before conversion they are
joined unto and mixed with wicked men, comparable to dross; and that
they have in them the dross, corruption, and impurity of sin; which is
original and natural to them, and inherent in them, and which can only
be removed by the grace of God and blood of Christ.

That they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness;
themselves, their bodies and souls; the sacrifices of prayer, praise,
and alms deeds; to the offering up of which in righteousness, in
sincerity and truth, in an upright way, it is necessary that a person
should be purified by the blood of Christ, and sanctified by the grace
of his Spirit.

\(a\) Hilchot Melachim, c. 12. sect. 3.

[Malachi 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 3:4</span></span>

Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the
Lord,.... Or "sweet" (b); grateful and well pleasing to him, as all
spiritual sacrifices are acceptable to God through Christ, being offered
up in the faith of his atoning sacrifice and righteousness, without
which it is impossible to please God:

as in the days of old, and as in former years: under the first temple,
and when the tabernacle was set up by Moses, and in the times of the
patriarchs; and even before the flood, and as early as Abel, who offered
a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, [Heb
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004.md).

\(b\) "dulcescet", Vatablus, Pagninus, Montanus, Drusius; "dulce",

[Malachi 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 3:5</span></span>

And I will come near to you to judgment,.... And so will manifestly
appear to be the God of judgment they asked after, [Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017.md) this is not to be understood of
Christ's coming to judgment at the last day, but of his coming to judge
and punish the wicked Jews at the time of Jerusalem's destruction; for
the same is here meant, who is spoken of in the third person before, and
who will not be afar off; there will be no need to inquire after him,
when he will come he will be near enough, and too near for them:

and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers; not only a judge,
but a witness; so that there will be no delay of judgment, or
protracting or evading it, for want of witnesses of facts alleged; for
the Judge himself, who is Christ, will be witness of them, he being the
omniscient God, before whom all things are manifest. The Targum is,

"my Word shall be among you for a swift witness.''

Mention is made of "sorcerers", because there were many that used the
magic art, enchantments, and sorceries, in the age of Christ and his
apostles, and before the destruction of Jerusalem, even many of their
doctors and members of the sanhedrim; See Gill on [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md),

and against the adulterers; with whom that age also abounded; hence our
Lord calls it an adulterous generation, [Mat
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039.md),

and against false swearers; who were guilty of perjury, and of vain
oaths; who swore by the creatures, and not by the Lord, and to things
not true; see [Mat 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033.md),

and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and
the fatherless; defrauding of servants of their wages, devouring widows'
houses, and distressing the fatherless, were sins the Jews were addicted
to in those times, as appears from [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md) who wrote to the twelve tribes;
and from what our Lord charges them with, [Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014.md),

and that turn aside the stranger from his right; and so Kimchi supplies
it,

"that turn aside the judgment of the stranger;''

that do not do him justice in civil things; yea, persecuted those that
became proselytes to the Christian religion:

and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts; which was the root and cause
of all their sins; irreverence of Christ, disbelief of him, and contempt
of his Gospel.

[Malachi 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 3:6</span></span>

For I am the Lord,.... Or Jehovah; a name peculiar to the most High, and
so a proof of the deity of Christ, who here speaks; and is expressive of
his being; of his self-existence; of his purity and simplicity; of his
immensity and infinity; and of his eternity and sovereignty:

I change not; being the same today, yesterday, and forever; he changed
not in his divine nature and personality by becoming man; he took that
into union with him he had not before, but remained the same he ever
was; nor did he change in his threatenings of destruction to the Jews,
which came upon them according to his word; nor in his promises of his
Spirit, and presence, and protection to his people; nor will he ever
change in his love and affections to them; nor in the efficacy of his
blood, sacrifice, and righteousness; wherefore, as this is introduced to
assure the truth and certainty of what is said before, concerning his
being a swift witness against the wicked, so also for the comfort of the
saints, as follows. The Targum is,

"for I the Lord have not changed my covenant.''

Therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed; such who were Israelites
indeed, true believers in Christ; these were not consumed when the
wicked Jews were, but were directed to leave the city before its
destruction, and go to another place, as they did, whereby they were
preserved; and so it was, that not one Christian perished in it; See
Gill on [Mat 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013.md) and so it is owing
to the unchangeable love, grace, and power of Christ, that none of his
perish internally or eternally, but have everlasting life.

[Malachi 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mal 3:7</span></span>

Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
ordinances,.... Here begins an enumeration of the sins of the Jews,
which were the cause of their ruin; and here is first a general charge
of apostasy from the statutes and ordinances of the law, which they made
void by the traditions of the fathers; and therefore this word is used
as referring to this evil, as well as to express their early, long, and
continued departure from the ways of God; which as it was an aggravation
of their sin, that they should have so long ago forsook the ordinances
of God,

and have not kept them, but transgressed them by observing the
traditions of men, [Mat 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#003.md) so it is
an instance of the patience and forbearance of God, that they were not
as yet consumed; and of his grace and goodness, that he should address
them as follows:

Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts;
this message was carried to them by John the Baptist, the forerunner of
Christ, and by Christ himself, who both preached the doctrine of
repentance to this people, [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md).
The Targum is,

"return to my worship, and I will look in my word to do well unto you,
saith the Lord of hosts;''

and such who returned, and believed in Christ, and submitted to his
ordinances, it was well with them.

But ye said, Wherein shall we return? what have we to turn from, or
repent of? what evils have we done, or can be charged on us? what need
have we of repentance or conversion, or of such an exhortation to it? do
not we keep the law, and all the rituals of it? this is the true
language of the Pharisees in Christ's time, who, touching the
righteousness of the law, were blameless in their own esteem, and were
the ninety and nine just persons that needed not repentance, [Luk
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#007.md).

[Malachi 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mal 3:8</span></span>

Will a man rob God?.... Or "the gods"; the false gods, the idols of the
Gentiles; the Heathens will not do that, accounting sacrilege a great
sin, and yet this the Jews were guilty of: or "the judges" (c), as the
Targum; civil magistrates; will any dare to defraud them of their due?
see [Mal 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008.md).

Yet ye have robbed me; keeping back from the priests and Levites, his
ministers, what was due to them; and which, being no other than a
spoiling or robbing of them, might be interpreted a robbing of God:

But ye say, wherein have we robbed thee? as not being conscious of any
such evil; or, however, impudently standing in it, that they were not
guilty: to which is returned the answer,

In tithes and offerings; that is, they robbed God in not giving the
tithes, and not offering sacrifices, according as the law required: but
it may be objected, that the Jews in Christ's time did pay tithes, even
of all things; yea, of more than the law required, [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md) to which it may be replied, that
though they gave tithes, yet it was , "with an evil eye", as Aben Ezra
says; grudgingly, and not cheerfully, and with an evil intention; not to
show their gratitude to God, and their acknowledgment of him as their
Lord, from whom they had their all, but in order to merit at his hands;
besides, our Lord suggests that they did not give to God the things that
were God's, [Mat 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#021.md) and the apostle
charges them with being guilty of sacrilege, [Rom
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#022.md) and, moreover, the priests might
not give it to the Levites, as they ought; and which is what they are
charged with in [Neh 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010.md) and Grotius
says that they were guilty of this before the destruction by Vespasian,
as appears by Josephus.

[Malachi 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mal 3:9</span></span>

Ye are cursed with a curse,.... Or "with penury", as the Vulgate Latin
version; which, though not a proper rendering of the word, is the
meaning of the curse they were cursed with; rain was withheld from them
for their sins, and the earth did not bring forth its usual increase;
wherefore there was want of food in all their land; their blessings were
cursed, as in [Mal 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#002.md) for the
following reason,

for ye have robbed me; because of this their iniquity, in not bringing
their offerings to the Lord, and the tithes to the priests and Levites,
their land was stricken with barrenness, and God gave them cleanness of
teeth, and want of bread in all places: or, "but ye have robbed me" (d);
notwithstanding they were thus chastised of the Lord, yet were not
reformed, but went on in withholding from God and the priests, what
belonged to them:

even this whole nation; the sin was become general, and therefore a
general judgment was inflicted on them: Grotius thinks, that the people
seeing the priests withhold the tithes from the Levites, they refused to
pay them to them, and so the sin became universal. Kimchi observes, that
in other sins charged upon the nation, the people were not all alike
guilty, but in this which respected the tithes and offerings they were.

\(d\) "et tamen diripitis me", De Dieu.

[Malachi 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mal 3:10</span></span>

Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,.... Or "treasury" (e); for
there were places in the temple where the tithe was put, and from thence
distributed to the priests and Levites, for the support of their
families, as they wanted. There were the tithe or tenth part of all
eatable things paid to the Levites, and out of this another tithe was
paid by the Levites to the priests; and there was another tithe, which
some years the owners ate themselves at Jerusalem, and in others gave
them to the poor; and these were called the first tithe, the tithe out
of the tithe, the second tithe, and the poor's tithe; though they are
commonly reduced to three, and are called first, and second, and third,
as they are by Maimonides; who says (f),

"after they have separated the first tithe every year, they separate the
second tithe, as it is said "thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of
thy seed", &c. [Deu 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md) and in the
third year, and in the sixth, they separate the poor's tithe, instead of
the second tithe.''

So Tobit says; Tobit 1:7

"the first tithe I gave to the Levites, who stand before the Lord to
minister to him, and to bless in his name the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
the second tithe I sold (as he might, according to the law in [Deu
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#024).md), and took the money, and went
up to Jerusalem, and bought with it what I pleased; and the third tithe
I gave to the repair of the temple;''

so Fagius reads: but according to Munster's edition it is, the second
and third tithes I gave to the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow;
see [Deu 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md). It appears from hence
that the sin of the people was, that they did not bring in "all" their
tithes; they kept back a part of them: wherefore they are called upon to
bring in the whole, and which they did in Nehemiah's time; see [Neh
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#038.md) where mention is made of the
treasuries for the tithe, which were certain chambers adjoining to the
temple; and besides those that were built by Solomon, there were other
chambers prepared by Hezekiah in his times, when the tithes were brought
in, in such plenty, that there was not room enough for them, [Ch2
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#011.md) and besides those in the second
temple, that were in the court of the priests, there were others in the
court of the people, as L'Empereur thinks (g), where what the others
could not contain might be put; and into which court the priests might
come; and there were also receptacles underground, as well as upper
rooms, where much might be laid up; add to all this, that Dr. Lightfoot
(h) suggests, that these tithes were treasured up in the chambers by the
gates of the temple, and were at least a part of the treasuries of the
house of God, which the porters at the gates had the care of, [Ch1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026.md) and particularly that the house
of Asuppim, at which were four porters, was a large piece of building,
containing divers rooms for the treasuring up things for the use of the
temple; in the Apocrypha:

" And are resolved to spend the firstfruits of the the tenths of wine
and oil, which they had sanctified, and reserved for the priests that
serve in Jerusalem before the face of our God; the which things it is
not lawful for any of the people so much as to touch with their hands.''
Judith 11:13

that there may be food in mine house; in the temple, for the sustenance
of the priests and Levites: so the Targum,

"the prophet said, bring all the tithes into the treasury, that there
may be food for them that minister in the house of my sanctuary:''

and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts; by bringing in all
their tithes; when they would find, by making this experiment or trial,
that the curse would be removed from them, and blessings be largely and
liberally bestowed upon them by him, who is the Lord of hosts, and so
able to perform any promise he makes; and here one is implied, and is as
follows:

if I will not open you the windows of heaven; which had been shut and
stopped up, and let down no rain upon their land, which brought a
scarcity of provisions among them; but now, upon a change in their
conduct it is suggested that these windows or floodgates should be
opened, and rain let down plentifully upon them, which only could be
done by the Lord himself; for the key of rain is one of the three keys,
the Jews say (i), which God has reserved for himself, and never puts
into the hands of a minister:

and pour you out a blessing: give abundance of rain to make the earth
fruitful, and bring forth its increase in great plenty, which is a
blessing; and not destroy the earth, and the fruits of it, as in the
times of Noah, when the windows of heaven were opened, and a curse was
poured out upon the earth:

that there shall not be room enough to receive it; and so Kimchi says
his father interpreted this clause, that there would not be a
sufficiency of vessels (k) and storehouses. Some render the words, as
Junius, "so that ye shall not be sufficient"; either to gather in the
increase, or to consume it. The Targum is,

"until ye say it is enough;''

and so the Syriac version. The phrase, which is very concise in the
original text, and may be literally rendered, "unto not enough" (l),
denotes great abundance and fulness of good things, so that there should
be enough and to spare; and yet, as Gussetius observes, not enough to
answer and express the abundance of mercy and goodness in the heart of
God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mal 3:11</span></span>

And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes,.... Or "eater" (m); the
locust or caterpillar, or any such devouring creature, that eats up the
herbage, corn, and fruits of trees; every such creature is under the
restraint of Providence; and by a nod, a rebuke, they are easily
prevented doing the mischief they otherwise would; these are the Lord's
great army, which he can send and call off as he pleases, [Joe
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md),

and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; as he has done, by
eating all green things, as the locust, caterpillar, and canker worm do,
grass, corn, and trees:

neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field;
which some understand of the devourer or locust, that that should not
cause the vine to be abortive, or cast its fruit before its time, or
bereave it of it; but it seems best to interpret it of the vine itself
not casting its fruit, as an untimely birth, by blighting and blasting
winds:

saith the Lord of hosts; who holds the winds in his fists, and will not
suffer them when he pleases, any more than the locusts, to hurt the
trees of the earth, [Rev 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md).

And all nations shall call you blessed,.... When they shall see the land
freed from the devouring locust, and other hurtful creatures; the former
and the latter rains given in their season, and the earth yielding a
large increase:

for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts; or a
desirable (n) one; not only pleasant to themselves, being fruitful, but
wished for by others, by their neighbouring nations, who, seeing their
prosperity, could not but desire to dwell with them; or delightsome to
the Lord of hosts: thus Jarchi interprets it, the land that I delight
in; and so Aben Ezra; to which agrees the Targum,

"and all nations shall praise you, because you dwell in the land of the
house of my Shechinah or majesty, and do my will in it;''

and the Syriac version renders it, "the land of my delight": see [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md).

[Malachi 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mal 3:13</span></span>

Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord,.... Hard and
strong; they bore very hardly upon him, were exceeding impudent and
insolent; murmuring at his providence; arraigning his justice and
goodness; and despising his word, worship, and ordinances. Aben Ezra
says, this is a prophecy concerning the time to come, that is, the times
of the Messiah; and so it describes the Jews in his times.

Yet ye say, what have we spoken so much against thee? or "what have we
spoken against thee?" as if they were not guilty in any respect, and as
if nothing could be proved against them; and as though the Lord did not
know what they had said in their hearts, seeing they had not spoken it
with their mouths: though the supplement of our translators, "so much",
is confirmed by the Targum, which is,

"and if ye say, how (or in what) have we multiplied speech before
thee?''

and so Kimchi observes, that the form in which the Hebrew word is
denotes much and frequent speaking: and Abarbinel agrees with him,
though he rather thinks it has this sense, "what are we spoken of to
thee?" what calumny is this? what accusation do they bring against us to
thee? what is it that is reported we say against thee? thus wiping their
mouths, as if they were innocent and harmless.

[Malachi 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mal 3:14</span></span>

Ye have said, it is vain to serve God,.... This they said in their
hearts, if not with their lips, that it was a vain thing for a man to
serve God; he got nothing by it; he had no reward for it; it fared no
better with him than the wicked; nay, the wicked fared better than he;
and therefore who would be a worshipper of God? see [Job
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#015.md). Abarbinel understands this also
with respect to God, who is worshipped; to whom worship, say these men,
is no ways profitable, nor does he regard it; see [Job
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#007.md) and therefore it is in vain to
serve him, since neither he, nor we, are the better for it:

and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance; or "his
observation" (n); that is, have observed that which he commanded to be
observed; this respects not any single and particular ordinance, but
every ordinance of God: the Sadducees of those times seem designed, who
denied the resurrection of the dead, and a future state of rewards and
punishments, and so might well conclude it in vain to serve God:

and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts? or "in
black" (o); which is the habit of mourners; see [Psa
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#006.md) with an humble spirit, as Jarchi
interprets it; or with humiliation (or contrition) of spirit, as the
Targum, which paraphrases the whole verse thus,

"ye have said, he gains nothing who worships before the Lord; and what
mammon (or riches) do we gain because we have kept the observation of
his word, and because we have walked in contrition of spirit before the
Lord of hosts?''

Aben Ezra and Abarbinel seem to understand this last clause of their
being afflicted and suffering for the sake of religion, and which they
endured in vain, seeing they were not respected and rewarded for it; but
the other sense is best, which represents them as sincere penitents, and
humble worshippers of God in their own account, and yet were not taken
notice of by him: it seems to describe the Pharisees, who disfigured
their faces, and affected down looks and sorrowful countenances (p).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mal 3:15</span></span>

And now we call the proud happy,.... Or "therefore now" (q); since this
is the case, that the worshippers of God are not regarded, and there is
nothing got by serving him; they that are proud and haughty, that
neither fear God nor regard men, are the happy persons; even
presumptuous sinners, as the word (r) signifies, that stretch out their
hands against God, and strengthen themselves against the Almighty; these
enjoy all worldly happiness, while they that serve the Lord are mourning
in sackcloth, and are in the utmost distress. The Targum explains it of
the ungodly, and as it is explained in the following clause:

yea, they that work wickedness are set up: or "built up" (s); or
"seeing, because", or "for they that work" (t), &c.; they are increased
with children, by which their houses or families are built up; they are
in a well settled and established condition; they abound in riches and
honours; they are set in high places, and are in great esteem among men,
even such who make it their constant business to commit sin:

yea, they that tempt God; or "yea, they tempt God" (u); by their wicked
words and actions, and try whether he will cause his judgments to fall
upon them, which he has threatened to such sinners; see [Isa
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018.md),

are even delivered; or, "and are delivered" (w); from the punishment
threatened; they escape it, and go on with impunity; from which
observations these persons reasoned that there was no God of judgment,
or that judged in the earth; that there was no providence concerned
about human affairs; and that there was nothing in religion; and these
were the hard and stout words which they spoke against the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mal 3:16</span></span>

Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another,.... Abarbinel
thinks this is a continuation of the speech of the wicked; observing,
that while they that work wickedness were set up, and they that tempted
God escaped punishment, they that were religious, and feared God, "were
destroyed one with another", particularly by the plague; so he would
have the word rendered, which we translate, "spake often one to
another"; in which sense he observes that root is used in [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md) but rather this is opposed unto
what they said, by such, who, at the time referred to (which seems to be
between the time of Christ's coming, spoken of in the beginning of the
chapter [Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md), and the destruction
of Jerusalem after mentioned), feared the Lord, and served him; embraced
the Messiah, and professed his name; for the fear of God takes in the
whole of religious worship, both internal and external; and describes
such, not that have a dread of the majesty of God, and of his judgments
and wrath, or distrust his power, providence, grace, and goodness; but
who have a filial and holy fear of God, a fiducial and fearless one, a
reverential affection for him, and are true and sincere worshippers of
him: these "spake often one to another"; of the unbelief, impiety, and
profaneness of men, with great concern and lamentation; and of the great
and good things they were led into the knowledge of; the everlasting
love of the Father in the choice of them, and covenant with them in
Christ; of redemption by the Son; of the glories of his person, and the
fulness of his grace; of the work of the Spirit of God upon their souls;
and of the various truths of the everlasting Gospel; and of the gracious
experiences they were indulged with; and all this they said for the
glory of God's grace, and for the comforting and strengthening, and
edifying, of each other's souls: it follows,

and the Lord hearkened, and heard it; what they said one to another:
this is spoken after the manner of men, and does not so much regard the
omniscience of God, who hearkens and hears everything that is said by
wicked men, as by good men; as his special regard unto, peculiar notice
he takes of, and the approbation he has of his people, and of their
words and actions, and even of their thoughts, as is afterwards
intimated:

and a book of remembrance was written before him; in allusion to kings
that keep registers, records, annals, and chronicles, as memorials of
matters of moment and importance: see [Ezr
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#015.md) [Est
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#023.md), otherwise there is no
forgetfulness in God; he bears in his own eternal mind a remembrance of
the persons, thoughts, words, and actions of his people, and which he
will disclose and make mention of another day; even our Lord Jesus
Christ, who is God over all, and who will let the churches and world
know that he is the searcher of hearts, and trier of the reins of the
children of men:

for them that feared the Lord, as before,

and that thought upon his name; either the name of the Father; not any
particular name of his, by which he is known, but him himself; for, as
Kimchi observes, his name is himself, and he himself is his name; and
especially as he is in Christ, and proclaimed in him; and this is
expressive of faith in him, love to him, and reverence of him: or the
name of Christ; and not any particular name of his, unless it be Jesus
the Saviour: but rather his person as the Son of God; his office as
Mediator; and his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice: and it is not a
bare thinking of him that is here intended, but such a thought of him as
is accompanied with esteem and value for him, because of the dignity of
his person, and the riches of his grace. The Septuagint and Arabic
versions render it, "and that reverence his name"; and the Syriac
version, "that praise his name"; and the Targum is, that think of the
glory of his name.

[Malachi 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mal 3:17</span></span>

And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts,.... That is, such as
fear the Lord, and think of him, hereby they are known to be his; and
hereafter, in the time referred to, it will be manifest that they are
his: they are Christ's already by his Father's gift of them to him; by
his own purchase; by the conquests of his grace; and by the voluntary
surrender of themselves: but, in the last day, they will be claimed and
owned by Christ before his Father and his holy angels; and they will be
known to be his, by themselves and others; and there will be no doubt
about it, or questioning of it:

in that day when I make up my jewels; Christ has some, who are his
jewels, or peculiar treasure, as the word (x) here used signifies; who
are loved with an everlasting love; chosen in him; redeemed by him;
justified by his righteousness; have the graces of his Spirit in them:
and will be glorified: they are a peculiar people, separate from all
others, and preferred unto them; for whom Christ has the strongest
affection, and takes special care of: and there is a time when he will
make them up; the number of them is already complete in eternal
election; and there was a gathering of them together in Christ at his
death; at every conversion there is an addition to them, as his
regenerated and sanctified ones; and at death they are received into
heaven, into his presence and bosom; and at the last day there will be a
collection of them all together. The words may be rendered, even "my
jewels in the day that I shall make" (y); or "the day I shall make
peculiar": distinct from all others; meaning either the famous Gospel
day, made by him the sun of righteousness, in which so many of his
jewels are picked up, and brought in; or the day of Jerusalem's
destruction, when Christ took care of his jewels, and by the
preservation of them showed that they were his, even all that believed
in him; so that not one perished that believed in him, when he took
vengeance on his enemies, that disbelieved and rejected him. Kimchi
refers this to the day of judgment.

And I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him;
this is a favour not granted to the apostate angels; nor to the old
world; nor to the Jewish nation; nor even to the Son of God; but is
vouchsafed to his special people: the lives of these are spared, until
they are called by grace; and though they are sometimes afflicted and
chastised, it is very gently, and in love; their services are accepted,
and the imperfections in them overlooked; their sins are pardoned, and
they will find mercy at the great day of account; they are used in the
most tender manner, not only as a son, an own son, but as an obedient
one, for whom the greatest regard is had, and affection shown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mal 3:18</span></span>

Then shall ye return,.... Either the wicked, who will be "converted"
(z), as some render the word, and will have a different view of things,
and change their minds and language; or they that feared the Lord, who
at the time before spoken of will have a new turn of thought, and
another and clear discerning of persons and things, and better judge of
the dispensations of Providence: some that refer this to the
resurrection of the dead, and the last judgment, understand it, as
Abarbinel does, of the returning of souls to their bodies, when indeed
the difference between persons after described will be very discernible;
but it seems to refer to the time of Christ's first coming, and
Jerusalem's destruction:

and discern between the righteous and the wicked; the difference between
such who are really and truly righteous, who are here meant, even such
who believe in Christ, and are justified by his righteousness; and those
that are wicked, as all by nature are: though sometimes this character
designs the more profane and abandoned, and even professors of religion;
the difference between these is not always easily discerned; as for the
righteous, they are not known and discerned by the world; and by reason
of afflictions, temptations, and sins, they are apt to judge wrong of
themselves; and sometimes are so left to fall into sin, that they look
like others: and there are wicked men under the appearance of righteous
men, as were the Scribes and Pharisees in Christ's time; but by the
destruction that came upon them, and the preservation of such as
believed in Christ, it was discernible who were wicked, and who were
righteous; indeed, at the last day, this difference will be more
visible; in the bodies of the righteous, which will be raised glorious,
when those of the wicked will not; in their souls, having on the wedding
garment, the robe of Christ's righteousness, and perfectly holy; and in
their situation, being set at Christ's right hand, and the wicked at his
left; and by the characters that will be given of them by the Judge, and
the different sentences passed and executed on them:

between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not; that is,
between such persons that serve the Lord, and him only, privately and
publicly, in righteousness and true holiness, in spirit and in truth,
with faith and fervency, with reverence and fear, heartily and
willingly, seeking his glory, without any dependence on their services;
and those that are ungodly, or only outwardly serve the Lord, for
sinister ends, and with selfish views, and according to their own
inventions, and the traditions of men, and not the will of God, as the
Scribes and Pharisees; between whom, and Christ's sincere disciples and
followers, the awful day, described in the next chapter [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md), will make a manifest difference.
