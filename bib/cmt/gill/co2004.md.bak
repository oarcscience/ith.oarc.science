INTRODUCTION TO 2 CORINTHIANS 4

In this chapter, the apostle declares the constancy, sincerity, and
integrity of him, and his fellow ministers, in preaching the Gospel;
asserts the clearness and perspicuity of it; removes the charge of pride
and arrogance from them; takes notice of the afflictions he and others
endured, for the sake of the Gospel; what supports they had under them,
and what comforts they enjoyed: in [Co2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md) he observes, that seeing they were
employed in such a ministry, as before described in the preceding
chapter, though they met with troubles in it, they did not sink under
them; the reason of which was, partly the excellency of the ministry,
and partly the grace and mercy of God; and they were no less sincere
than they were diligent; and were the reverse of the false teachers, who
used dishonest methods, craftiness and deceit; these they disclaimed,
and delivered out naked truth, with all simplicity and evidence, and as
in the sight of God, in confirmation of which they could appeal to the
consciences of all that heard them, [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md) and whereas the apostle had
affirmed the plainness and clearness of the Gospel ministry, both in the
preceding chapter, and in the foregoing verse, he foresaw that an
objection would be raised against it, which he anticipates, [Co2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003.md) showing, that though the Gospel
was not spiritually discerned and savingly understood by some persons,
yet this was not to be charged upon the Gospel, as if it was attended
with darkness and obscurity; but it was owing to the unbelief of men,
and the power of Satan over them, in blinding their minds; otherwise the
Gospel in itself was light and glorious, in which Christ, the image of
God, in a most resplendent manner appears; and those on whom Satan thus
wrought were such as did not belong to God's elect, but were of the
number of them that perish: moreover the integrity of the apostle and
other ministers appeared in their preaching Christ, and not themselves;
and in serving the churches in that way, for the sake of Christ; so that
they were far from being chargeable with pride, vanity, and arrogance,
[Co2 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005.md) and they readily
acknowledged, that all the Gospel light they had was from that God, who
spoke light out of darkness in the first creation, whereby they were
qualified to communicate light to others, in the name of Christ, [Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md) and though they had a treasure
committed to their trust, and which they had within them, yet they
freely owned they were but earthen vessels; and the reason why such
treasure was put there was, that the power seen in the conversion of
sinners by their ministry might appear to be not of themselves, but of
the Lord, [Co2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md) and then the
apostle proceeds to give an account of the afflictions endured by them,
and of the divine supports they had, by which they were preserved from
being overwhelmed with them, [Co2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md)
one end of which afflictions, and which are signified by bearing the
dying of Jesus in their bodies, and by being exposed to death for his
sake, was, that his life might be manifest in them, or his power in the
upholding of them, [Co2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md) and
herein lay the difference between them and the Corinthians; the one were
in deaths oft, and in very great distresses, and the other in prosperous
circumstances, [Co2 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012.md) but however,
they had much consolation amidst their sorrows and troubles, and which
they had partly through the Spirit of faith, and in a way of believing;
and who after the example of David, and having the same Spirit as he
had, believed and spake, [Co2 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013.md) and
partly through the hope of the resurrection of the dead, to which they
were encouraged by the resurrection of Christ, [Co2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#014.md) as also by considering what
valuable ends were answered by their bearing afflictions for the sake of
Christ, and preaching the Gospel, namely the good of the churches of
Christ, and the glory of God, [Co2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015.md) and besides, they had an
experience of the daily renovation of the inward man, or of the carrying
on of the work of grace upon their souls; and of an increase of grace,
right, and joy in them; and this kept them from fainting, though their
outward circumstances and outward man were but in a poor condition, [Co2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016.md) but more especially what raised
their spirits, and kept them from sinking under their afflictions, was
the view they had of eternal glory and happiness, to which they had
respect; and the comparison they were led to make between their present
afflictions, and glory, which their afflictions were working for as,
that their afflictions were light, glory heavy; their afflictions were
but for a moment, their weight of glory was for ever; their afflictions
were seen and temporal, their glory unseen and eternal; or the things of
this world, which they often needed, and yet did not regard, were
visible and temporary things; but the things of another world they had
their eye upon were invisible, only visible to faith, and would endure
for ever.

[2 Corinthians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 4:1</span></span>

Therefore seeing we have this ministry,.... The apostle having largely
insisted on the difference between the law and the Gospel, the
ministration of the one and of the other, proceeds to give an account of
his own conduct, and that of his fellow apostles and ministers: "we",
says he, "faint not"; under all the reproaches cast upon us,
persecutions raised against us, and tribulations that attend us; we do
not sink in our spirits, or give out from the ministry; we go on
cheerfully in our work, in the thee of all opposition, encouraged by the
consideration of the excellency of the ministry, which they had from the
Lord, were put into, and continued in; which was so valuable in itself,
and so useful in its effects; being the ministration of the Spirit and
of righteousness, having in it such an excelling glory to the law, and
attended with so much light and liberty: to which he adds the
consideration of the mercy of God they were partakers of,

as we have received mercy; which may refer either to the grace and mercy
of God, which they had received in conversion; a sense of which abiding
upon them, so influenced their minds, to hold forth the riches of
abounding grace and mercy to poor sinners in the Gospel, that nothing
could deter them from it; or to the grace, favour, and good will of God,
in making, supporting, and continuing them as ministers of the word; all
which, they were sensible, was owing not to men, but God; not to their
merit, but to his mercy; not to their worthiness, parts, learning, &c.
but to his free gift, favour, and grace, by which only they were what
they were, as preachers of the Gospel.

[2 Corinthians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 4:2</span></span>

But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty,.... Or "shame"; this
is a further account of the conduct of the first ministers of the
Gospel, and very worthy of our imitation, and in which the apostle
strikes at the different manner of behaviour in the false apostles: this
may respect both doctrine and practice; they abhorred and rejected
everything that was scandalous and reproachful to the Gospel of Christ;
in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
grace of God, they had their conversation in the world; they were open
and above board, both in principle and practice; the same men in public,
as in private; they used no art to cover their doctrines, or hide their
conversations; everything of this kind was detestable to them; whereas
the false teachers took a great deal of pains to colour over both their
sentiments and their lives; and "a shame it was to speak of the things
that were done of them in secret", [Eph
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012.md). Moreover, they were

not walking in craftiness; they used no sly and artful methods to please
men, to gain applause from them, or make merchandise of them; they did
not lie in wait to deceive, watching an opportunity to work upon
credulous and incautious minds; they did not, by good words and fair
speeches, deceive the hearts of the simple; nor put on different forms,
or make different appearances, in order to suit themselves to the
different tempers and tastes of men, as did the false apostles:

not handling the word of God deceitfully. They did not corrupt it with
human doctrines, or mix and blend it with philosophy, and vain deceit;
they did not wrest the Scriptures to serve any carnal or worldly
purpose; nor did they accommodate them to the lusts and passions of men;
or conceal any part of truth, or keep back any thing which might be
profitable to the churches:

but by the manifestation of the truth, commending themselves to every
man's conscience in the sight of God; that is, they with all plainness
and evidence clearly preached the truth as it is in Jesus, presenting it
to, and pressing it upon the consciences of men; where they left it, and
to which they could appeal; and all this they did, in the sight and
presence of the omniscient God, to whom they knew they must give an
account of themselves and their ministry.

[2 Corinthians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 4:3</span></span>

But if our Gospel be hid,.... When the Gospel is called ours, the
meaning is, not that ministers are the authors or subject of it; but it
is so styled, because they are intrusted with it; it is preached by
them; and is in opposition to another Gospel, the Gospel of the false
apostles. Here an objection is obviated, which the apostle saw would be
made against the clearness and perspicuity of the Gospel, asserted by
him in the foregoing chapter; taken from some persons, who though they
sat under the ministry of the word, were not enlightened by it, saw no
glory nor excellency in it, nor were their minds in the least affected
with it: to which he replies, saying, "if our Gospel be hid",

it is hid to them that are lost. But why should the apostle put an if
upon its being hid? is it not hid? is it not "the wisdom of God in a
mystery, even the hidden wisdom?" To which may be answered, that it was
hid in God from the beginning of the world; and in Christ, in whom are
hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and in the ceremonial
law, which contained types and shadows of many things in it; and was hid
from whole nations, and for whole ages formerly: but now God has made
known the mystery of his will; Christ is manifest in the flesh; the
ceremonial law is done away, and the Gospel is preached to Jews and
Gentiles; so that it is hid to none, as to the outward ministration of
it: and if the internal, spiritual, and saving knowledge and experience
of it is hid from any, eventually and finally, it is "to them that are
lost": all mankind are in a lost and perishing condition through sin;
though some will not be lost eternally, whom God has chosen, Christ has
redeemed, and who by the Spirit are brought savingly to believe in
Christ; but there are others, that will be lost for ever; and to these
the Gospel is hid; and they are such, who are left to the native
blindness of their minds, and are given up to a reprobate mind, to
judicial darkness, and are suffered to be under the influence of the
prince of darkness, as in the following verse; now such instances are no
more an objection to the clearness and perspicuity of the Gospel, and
the ministration of it, than men born blind, who never could, nor never
will see light, are to the bright and clear shining of the sun noon day.

[2 Corinthians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 4:4</span></span>

In whom the god of this world hath blinded,.... The description of the
persons to whom the Gospel is hid, is here further carried on; in which
the character of Satan is given, who is here styled "the god of this
world"; just as he is by Christ, "the prince of this world", [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md) not because he had any hand in
the making of it, or has any concern in the government of it, or in the
disposal of men or things in it; but because of his influence over the
worst, and greatest part of the world; which lies in wickedness, under
the power of this wicked one, being led captive by him at his will; who
have voluntarily given themselves up to him, and whose lusts they will
do; and so declare themselves to be his children, and him their Father,
yea, their god: the influence he has over them is, he

hath blinded the minds of them that believe not. The apostle here seems
to refer to one of the devils, which the Jews (l) frequently speak of
"Samael"; who they say is the head of all the devils; a very malignant
spirit, and who deceived our first parents; the word is compounded of
"god", and "to blind"; him they call the angel of death, and say (m),
that he hath , "brought darkness upon the face of the world", or the
creatures, the Gentiles: agreeably to which the apostle calls the devil,
"the god that hath blinded"; what he blinds in men, is "their mind": the
more excellent and knowing part of man; not the eyes of their bodies,
but of their understandings; which shows the near access Satan has to
the souls of men; he penetrates into their very hearts and minds, and
has an influence there: the persons whose minds he blinds, are those
"who believe not"; which distinguishes them from others that perish, who
never enjoyed the Gospel, and therefore he says, "in", or "among whom";
and from true believers, on whom Satan can have no such influence; and
is a reason of these men's perishing, and of Satan's influence over
them; and must be understood of reprobates, and final unbelievers: the
influence he has over them is expressed by "blinding" them; which he
does, by diverting them from hearing the Gospel, and by stirring up the
enmity of their minds against it, and by increasing their natural
darkness and blindness with respect to it. The end which Satan has in
doing this is,

lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of
God, should shine unto them; here many things are hinted, in
commendation of the Gospel, as that it is the Gospel of Christ; because
he was not only the greatest and best preacher of it that ever was, but
also is the author and subject of it; Christ is the sum and substance of
the Gospel, the principal thing in it, or person that is spoken of
therein; and then Christ who is the grand subject of the Gospel is
described, in order to recommend it the more, as "the image of God". The
Jews (n) call the Messiah, , "the image of God"; some copies, and the
Complutension edition, and the Arabic version, read, "the image of the
invisible God", as in [Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md). So
Christ is as the Son of God, being the natural, substantial, essential,
eternal, not created, and perfect image of his Father; and so he is as
man and Mediator: further, the Gospel is said to be the "glorious"
Gospel of Christ, as it must needs be, since it so clearly and
illustriously sets forth the glory of Christ; contains such glorious
doctrines and promises in it, and is attended with such glorious
effects, where it comes with power: add to all this, that "light" is
attributed to it; the Jews (o) speak of the "light of the law", and the
law is called light; and say, that , "there is no light but the law";
but this may be more truly said of the Gospel, by which not only persons
may be notionally enlightened, who never were made really partakers of
the grace of God, but is the means of spiritual and saving illumination
to thousands, when it is attended with the demonstration of the Spirit:
now all these excellent characters of the Gospel serve to enhance the
spite and malice of Satan, in endeavouring all he can to kinder the
bright shining of this glorious Gospel, to and upon any of the sons of
men; and his reason for so doing is, because he knows, that should the
Gospel shine unto them, the interest and glory of Christ would be
advanced, and his own would decline.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 4:5</span></span>

For we preach not ourselves,.... These words contain a reason why the
apostles behaved themselves in the manner described, [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md) and serve to explain in what sense
this inspired writer is to be understood, when he calls the Gospel our
Gospel, [Co2 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003.md) and most clearly
proves the Gospel to be a glorious one, which he had asserted, [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md) since Christ, and not themselves,
is the subject of it, "for we preach not ourselves". They did not preach
any doctrine of their own devising; they did not set up themselves as
lords over the faith and consciences of men; nor was their view in
preaching to set forth their learning, parts, and eloquence, or to amass
wealth and riches to themselves; nor did they assert the purity of human
nature, or the power of man to do anything of himself that is
spiritually good; or that justification and salvation are by works of
righteousness done by men. To do any, or each, or all of these, as did
the false apostles, is to preach a man's self: but so did not these
faithful dispensers of the word, but they

preached Christ Jesus the Lord; that is, the doctrines respecting the
person, office, and grace of Christ; as that he is truly and properly
God, the eternal and only begotten Son of God, God and man in one
person, the only Mediator between God and man, and the Saviour and
Redeemer of lost sinners; that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the true
Messiah; and that this Christ is Jesus, a Saviour, the only able and
willing one; and that this Jesus Christ is "Lord" of all, especially of
the saints; not only as Creator, but as their head, husband, and
Redeemer; that peace and reconciliation, pardon and righteousness, life
and salvation, are only by him: and they also declared themselves the
servants of the churches,

and ourselves your servants. The apostle does not say they were the
servants of Christ, though they were, and esteemed it their greatest
honour to be so; for he had no need to observe this, since this is
included in their preaching him as "Lord": nor does he say they were the
servants of men, or menpleasers, for then they would not be the servants
of Christ; but he asserts them to be the servants of the churches: and
which must be understood, not with respect to things temporal, with
which they had no concern; but with regard to things spiritual,
particularly to the ministration of the word, and administration of
ordinances: and this they professed to be,

for Jesus' sake; either for the sake of preaching Christ unto them; or
because they were chosen and called by him to this service, and in which
they were willing to continue, for the sake of his honour and interest.

[2 Corinthians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 4:6</span></span>

For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,.... The
causal particle for, shows these words to be also a reason of the
foregoing; either why they so clearly beheld the glory of the Lord, [Co2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018.md) or why they renounced the hidden
things of dishonesty, [Co2 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md) or why
their Gospel could not be hid, [Co2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003.md) or why they did not preach
themselves, but Christ, [Co2 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005.md)
because God had

shined in their hearts; and in this light, they saw the glory of Christ;
could not bear any secret, hidden, scandalous practices; and held forth
the word of light and life to others; and seeing so much of their own
weakness, sinfulness, and unworthiness, dared not to preach themselves,
but Christ Jesus the Lord; in which may be observed the character of the
true God, as opposed to Satan, the god of this world, who is said to
blind the minds of men, [Co2 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md)
whereas the true God is represented as the author of "light", and as
producing it by a word of "command", and that "out" of mere "darkness";
respect is here had to the creation of all things at the beginning, when
"darkness was upon the face of the deep--and God said, let there be
light and there was light", [Gen 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md).
Now this character of God, as creating light in this wonderful manner,
is prefaced to his giving spiritual light unto his people; because of
the agreement there is between light corporeal and spiritual, in their
nature and production; for as there was darkness upon the earth before
there was light, so there is a natural darkness in the minds of men,
before any spiritual light is infused into them; and as light was the
first production out of the dark and unformed chaos, so light is the
first thing that is struck into the soul in conversion; moreover, as
light was the effect of almighty power, so is the spiritual
illumination, or the opening of the eyes of the understandings of men,
who are naturally born blind; and as light was a creation of that which
was not before, so the work of grace on the soul is not an increase of,
or an addition to, or an improvement of the light of nature, but it is a
new light, created in the understanding; add to all this, that both
corporeal and spiritual light are good, and both called "day"; the
influence that God has over the hearts of men, and the effect he
produces there are, he

hath shined in our hearts. The hearts of men are like this dark
terraqueous globe, having no light in them; God is as the sun, the
fountain of light, which shines upon them and in them; so as to give
them a true sight and sense of sin, and of their lost state and
condition; so as to cause them to see the fulness and suitableness of
Christ as a Saviour; so as to warm their affections, and draw out their
desires after Christ, his ways, truths, ordinances, and people; and so
as to give them light into the mysteries of the Gospel; particularly he
so shines into the hearts of some, whom be makes ministers of the
Gospel, as to give more light and knowledge into Gospel truths, than he
does to others; and his end in doing this, is

to give: that is, that his ministering servants may give

the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ; men must be first made light in, and by the Lord, or they will
never be fit and proper persons to hold forth the word of light, or to
communicate light to others; God first shines into their hearts, and
then they give light to others: by "the glory of God" is not meant the
essential glory of God, or the perfections of his nature, though these
are to be seen in the face, or person of Christ; but rather the glorious
counsels of God, and scheme of salvation by Jesus Christ; or in other
words, the glorious Gospel of God: and by "the knowledge" of it is
designed, not a mere notional speculative knowledge of the Gospel, but
an experimental one; a spiritual knowledge of the Gospel, of Christ in
it, of God in Christ, and of an interest in God's salvation by Christ:
now when the ministers of the word are said to give the light of this to
men, or to enlighten them with this knowledge, it cannot be thought that
they are the efficient causes, for such are only Jehovah, Father, Son,
and Spirit; but only that they are instrumental, and are means in the
hands of God, of bringing persons to see the fellowship of this mystery:
all which is done, "in the face of Jesus Christ"; this denotes the
clearness and perspicuity of their ministry, and of that knowledge which
is communicated by it; see [Co2 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#012.md)
and also the authority by which they act; it is in the name and person
of Christ, in which sense the phrase is used, [Co2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#010.md).

[2 Corinthians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 4:7</span></span>

But we have, this treasure in earthen vessels,.... This is a further
commendation of the Gospel; and by which the apostle removes an
objection against it, taken from the cross and persecutions that attend
it, and the outward meanness of the ministers of it. The Gospel is
called a "treasure", for not grace, nor Christ, but the Gospel is here
meant; which is so styled, because it contains rich truths, and an
abundance of them; comparable to gold, silver, and precious stones, for
the price of them, their antiquity, distance of place from whence they
come, and their duration; because it has in it rich blessings, spiritual
ones, the blessings of the new covenant, solid, substantial, and
irreversible ones, and a fulness of them; and because it consists of
exceeding great and precious promises, of more worth than thousands of
gold and silver; free, absolute, and unconditional ones, which are yea
and amen in Christ, and relate both to this, and the other world; and
also because it exhibits and shows forth to us the riches of God and of
Christ, of grace and of glory; which are unsearchable, substantial,
satisfying, and durable: the repository, or cabinet, in which this
treasure is, are "earthen vessels"; by which are meant, ministers of the
word, who are so in themselves, in their own esteem, and in the esteem
of others; probably the apostle might have in view [Lam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#002.md). The doctors and scholars among
the Jews are compared hereunto;

"says R. Eleazar (p), to what is a disciple of a wise man like, in the
esteem of a man of the world? at first he is like to a golden cup; when
he has conversed with him, he is like to a silver cup; and when he has
received any profit by him, he is like , "to an earthen cup", which,
when broken, cannot be repaired again: the law (say they) is not
confirmed but by him, who makes himself , "as an earthen vessel" (q): R.
Joshua (r) was a great man in the king's palace, and he was deformed;
wherefore Caesar's daughter said, wisdom is beautiful , "in an ugly
vessel"; and he brought her a simile in proof of it from wine, which is
not kept in a silver vessel.''

The allusion is either to the earth itself, in which treasure lies, or
is hid, and out of which it is dug; or to pots and vessels made of
earth, into which treasure has been used to be put; or to earthen
pitchers, in which lights or lamps were formerly carried; see [Jdg
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016.md) where Gideon's three hundred men,
are said to have empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers; they
carried lamps with them to give them light, it being night when they
went into the camp of Midian; and those they put into pitchers, that the
Midianites might not perceive them afar off, as a Jewish commentator
well observes (s); in like manner the Gospel put into earthen vessels is
a glorious light to some, whilst it is hidden to others: yea, even lamps
themselves were no other than earthen vessels, in which light was put;
for so says Maimonides (t), a lamp, a burning light, is , "an earthen
vessel", like a reed; and on the top of it is a little ear, which joins
to it; and when it is made, a piece of old cloth is put upon the burning
oil, and it continues in it; also an earthen vessel is made, in which
there is a hollow place for to set the light in, and in it is gathered
all that flows from the oil out of the light; and it is strengthened
about the head of the candlestick, that the brass might not be hurt by
the oil; and this vessel is called the house in which the light
subsides, or the receptacle of the light; and which receptacle, another
of the Misnic commentators says (u), is an earthen vessel, made to put
the light in; and the lamp, he also says, is like an earthen platter,
sharp pointed below, &c. and this allusion well agrees with the context,
in which the Gospel is represented as a glorious light, shining in
darkness, [Co2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md). The Greek word the
apostle uses, signifies also "shells of fishes"; and in like manner does
Philo the Jew (w) compare the human body;

"I am (says he) very little concerned for this mortal body which is
about me, and cleaves to me , "like the shell of a fish"; though it is
hurt by everyone.''

And the reference may be to pearls, which are said to have been found in
such shells, particularly in oysters; and is designed to express, either
the frail mortal bodies of the ministers of the Gospel, comparable to
brittle shells; or baked earth; or rather the outward mean despicable
condition of the apostles, and preachers of the word; being men of no
figure in the world, for birth, learning, or outward grandeur; and being
attended with sinful infirmities also, as other men; and more especially
as they were labouring under reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions,
for the sake of the Gospel; see [Jer
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#014.md). The reason why it pleased God
to put such a rich and valuable treasure into the hands of persons so
mean and contemptible was,

that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us: that is,
that it might appear that the making of such persons ministers of the
word was not of themselves, was not owing to their natural abilities, or
to any diligence and industry, and acquirements of their own, or to any
instructions they had received from others, but to the grace of God, and
the effectual working of his power; and that the success which attended
their ministrations in the conversion of sinners, and building up of
saints, could only be ascribed to the exceeding greatness of divine
power; and that the supporting of them in their work, under all the
persecutions raised against them, and opposition made unto them, could
be attributed to nothing else; of which power, instances are given in
the following verses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 4:8</span></span>

We are troubled on every side,.... Or afflicted; , either "in every
place", wherever we are, into whatsoever country, city, or town we
enter, we are sure to meet with trouble, of one sort or another; for
wherever we be, we are in the world, in which we must expect
tribulation: or "always", every day and hour we live, as in [Co2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md) we are never free from one trial
or another: or "by everyone"; by all sorts of persons, good and bad,
professors and profane, open persecutors and false brethren; yea, some
of the dear children of God, weak believers, give us trouble: or "with
every sort" of trouble, inward and outward; trouble from the world, the
flesh and the devil:

yet not distressed; so as to have no hope, or see no way of escape; so
as to have no manner of comfort, or manifestations of the love of God;
or so as to be straitened in our own souls; for notwithstanding all our
troubles, we have freedom at the throne of grace, and in our ministry;
we can go with liberty to God, and preach the Gospel boldly to you:

we are perplexed; and sometimes know not what to do, which way to take,
what course to steer, or how we shall be relieved and supplied; we are
sometimes at the utmost loss about things temporal, how we shall be
provided for with food and raiment; nor are we without our perplexing
thoughts, doubts, and fears, about spiritual affairs:

but not in despair; of the Lord's appearing and working salvation, both
in a temporal and spiritual sense.

[2 Corinthians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 4:9</span></span>

Persecuted, but not forsaken,.... Pursued from place to place, and
followed with menaces, curses, and reproaches; laid hold on, proscribed,
imprisoned, and threatened with the severest tortures, and death itself;
but our God never leaves us nor forsakes us; though we are followed
close by evil men, and left by our friends, we are not forsaken of God:

cast down we sometimes are, as an earthen vessel; [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md), which may be cast out of a man's
hands, in order to be dashed to pieces; or as a man in wrestling, see
[Eph 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md) may be thrown to the ground
by his antagonist, so we are sometimes foiled by sin, Satan, and the
world:

but not destroyed; we are still safe in the hands of Christ, and are
kept by the power of God; and, indeed, to what else can all this be
ascribed? it is surprising that earthen vessels should bear and suffer
so much, and not fall, or be dashed to pieces.

[2 Corinthians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 4:10</span></span>

Always bearing about in the body,.... The Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and
Ethiopic versions, read, "in our body"; and the Syriac version, in this
and the next clause, reads, "in our bodies", and some copies in this
read, "bodies"; continually carrying about with us, in these mortal
bodies of ours, wherever we go,

the dying of the Lord Jesus; by which is meant, not the doctrine of the
sufferings and death of Christ, and of salvation by a crucified Saviour,
which they bore and carried about with them in a ministerial way,
wherever they came and preached, but the sufferings they themselves
underwent: so called, because of the likeness there is between the
sufferings of Christ, and theirs; as he was traduced as a wicked man, a
deceiver, and a stirrer up of sedition, so were they; as he was
persecuted, so were they; as he was liable to death, and at last was
delivered up to it, so were they: and also because of the union and
sympathy which were between them; Christ and they were one body and one
Spirit; so that what was endured by the members, the head had a fellow
feeling of, and sympathy with; and reckoned what was done to them, as
done to himself: and besides, the sufferings they underwent, and death
they were exposed unto, were for his sake, as it is explained in the
next verse:

for we which live; who are still in the land of the living, though it is
almost a miracle we are, considering the circumstances we are in:

are always delivered; that is, continually exposed

to death for Jesus' sake: and the end of all these sufferings, which is
expressed alike in both verses is,

that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body, or
"mortal flesh"; the meaning of which is, that it might appear that
Jesus, though he died, is risen again from the dead, and lives at the
Father's right hand, and ever lives to make intercession for us; of
which there is a full proof, inasmuch as we are supported by him under
all the trials and sufferings we endure for his sake; for because he
lives, we live also, amidst so many dangers and deaths, which attend us.

[2 Corinthians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 4:12</span></span>

So then death worketh in us,.... This is the conclusion of the foregoing
account, or the inference deduced from it; either the death, or dying of
Christ, that is, the sufferings of his body, the church, for his sake,
"is wrought in us"; fulfilled and perfected in us; see [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md) or rather a corporeal death has
seized upon us; the seeds of death are in us; our flesh, our bodies are
mortal, dying off apace; death has already attacked us, is working on
our constitutions gradually, and unpinning our tabernacles, which in a
short time will be wholly took down and laid in the dust:

but life in you. Some understand these words as spoken ironically, like
those in [Co1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008.md) but the apostle
seems not to be speaking in such a strain, but in the most serious
manner, and about things solemn and awful; and his meaning is, ours is
the sorrow, the trouble, the affliction, and death itself, yours is the
gain, the joy, the pleasure, and life; what we get by preaching the
Gospel are reproach, persecution, and death; but this Gospel we preach
at such expense is the savour of life unto life to you, and is the means
of maintaining spiritual life in your souls, and of nourishing you up
unto eternal life; and which is no small encouragement to us to go on in
our work with boldness and cheerfulness: or these words regard the
different state and condition of the apostle, and other ministers, and
of the Corinthians; the one were in adversity, and the other in
prosperity.

[2 Corinthians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 4:13</span></span>

We having the same Spirit of faith,.... By faith here is meant, not the
doctrine, but the grace of faith; a believing in the doctrines of the
Gospel, and in the person of Christ; an exercise of that grace upon the
death and resurrection of Christ; and particularly a looking by faith in
full expectation of the saints' resurrection from the dead, and eternal
glory, together with a reliance on the power, faithfulness, and promises
of God to support under the afflictions of this life. Now of this faith
the Spirit of God is the author; this is not of ourselves, of our own
power, it is the free gift of God, and a valuable gift it is; it is of
the operation of God, and the produce of his almighty power; and of this
the Spirit of God, in conversion, is the powerful operator: hence he is
here called the "Spirit of faith". So the "third" number in the
Cabalistic tree of the Jews, the intelligence sanctifying, which answers
to the third person in our doctrine of the Trinity, is called (x),

"Nmwa hnwma and , "the artificer of faith", and "the author or parent of
faith", because from its power faith flows.''

Which is the "same" in all saints; the Spirit is the same in one as in
another, and so is the faith which he is the author of; see [Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md). Faith is the same in all the
saints that have been from the beginning of the world, under the Old and
New Testament dispensations; it was the same in all the churches in the
apostle's time, in Rome as at Ephesus, in Ephesus as at Rome, and in
Thessalonica as at Rome and Ephesus, and so in all the other churches;
though it may be, the apostle may chiefly design the sameness of faith,
and of the Spirit, in him and his fellow ministers, and in these
Corinthians, though death was working in the one, and life in the other;
which appeared in their free and bold ministration of the word,
notwithstanding all they met with on account of it, in imitation and
encouraged by the example of David,

according as it is written, [Psa
116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010.md).

I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore
speak: where there is true faith, and the true Spirit of faith, there
will be a speaking of, for, and in the name of Christ, as there ought to
be: for as "with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, so with the
mouth confession is made unto salvation". This is true of believers in
common, sooner or later, at one time or another; but more especially of
the ministers of the word, who have a firm and well grounded belief in
the doctrines of the Gospel, and person of Christ; and therefore speak
freely, and without any doubt and hesitation about these things, boldly,
and without the fear of men, and sincerely and faithfully, as in the
sight of God: hence they make Christ the main subject of their ministry,
because they believe in him, and nothing can stop their mouths from
speaking of him; faith, and a spirit of faith, fit for public work and
service, and give freedom and boldness in the ministration of the
Gospel, and are a great support under persecution for the sake of it.

[2 Corinthians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 4:14</span></span>

Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus,.... Besides having the
same spirit of faith, mentioned in the preceding verse as a support
under tribulation, the apostle proceeds in this, and some following
verses, to take notice of other things which gave them relief under
their pressures; such as the resurrection from the dead, all their
afflictions being for the good of the churches and glory of God, the
inward and comfortable experiences of the love and grace of God in the
midst of them, and the end and issue of them, eternal glory. The former
of these is observed here; "knowing", being firmly persuaded, and fully
assured, that he "which raised up the Lord Jesus"; by whom God the
Father is more especially designed, though not to the exclusion of the
Son and Spirit, who were jointly concerned in raising the dead body of
our Lord: shall raise us up also by Jesus; which may regard the
resurrection of all the saints by Christ, not as a mere instrument, but
as a co-efficient cause with the Father and Spirit: this the apostle
concludes from the power of God in raising up Christ from the dead; he
that is able to do the one, is certainly of power to effect the other;
and also from that union there is between Christ and his people; he is
the head, they are his members; and because the head is raised, the
members shall be likewise. Christ's resurrection is not only the
pattern, but the pledge of the resurrection of the saints. Now this
doctrine, as it was fully known, and firmly believed by the apostles,
was of great use to bear them up under their outward troubles; for
though they were so afflicted and persecuted, death was visibly working
in them, and they might expect in a short time to be laid in the grave;
yet this was their consolation, that they should be raised again
immortal and glorious by Christ; some copies read, "with Jesus", and so
the Vulgate Latin version: "he shall present us with you"; that is, he
will present us ministers, together with you the saints, and the rest of
the elect of God; first, "to himself", as the Syriac version adds, and
then to his Father, in their full number, completely righteous and holy.
These words indeed may be understood of a deliverance from temporal
affliction, from that death they were labouring under, and exposed unto,
and the sense be this; we firmly believe that he that raised up Christ
from the dead, will deliver us from the present death of affliction,
which will be a sort of resurrection from the dead, and will make us to
stand by you, or in your presence; or, in other words, being thus
delivered, we shall have an opportunity of visiting you, we have so long
desired, and you have expected, which will be to your edification and
comfort.

[2 Corinthians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 4:15</span></span>

For all things are for your sakes;.... This is a very large and
comprehensive expression, and reaches to all the things of Christ, as
well as of his ministers. The incarnation, obedience, death, and
resurrection of Christ, are all for the sake of God's elect; and so the
ministry of his apostles and servants, their gifts, graces, comforts,
and experiences; and so likewise all their reproaches, afflictions, and
persecutions; see [Co2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006.md). These were
endured for their sakes, and tended to their establishment in the faith;
were for the furtherance of the Gospel, and of the faith and joy of
saints; and this gave no small pleasure and relief to them under their
sufferings, that they were of such use to others. Moreover, all their
deliverances, when in any imminent danger; were for the sake of the
churches:

that the abundant grace; held forth in their ministrations, manifestly
to be seen in supporting them under their troubles, and delivering them
out of them:

might through the thanksgiving of many; for such appearances of divine
goodness, see [Co2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011.md)

redound to the glory of God; which is another thing that yielded them a
pleasing satisfaction, in all their distresses for the sake of Christ,
and his Gospel.

[2 Corinthians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 4:16</span></span>

For which cause we faint not,.... Since our afflictions are overruled
for the good of others, and the glory of God, we are not discouraged by
them; our spirits do not sink under the weight of them; we do not give
out from the work of the ministry because of them, but go on cheerfully
therein: and the more so, since

though our outward man perish; our outward circumstances of life are
very mean and despicable; we are oftentimes in a very distressed
condition through hunger, thirst, nakedness, and want of the common
necessaries of life; our bodies are almost worn out with fatigue,
labour, and sorrow; our earthly tabernacles are tottering, and just
ready to fall in pieces:

yet the inward man is renewed day by day; that is, continually; it
answers to , an Hebraism; see [Est
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#011.md) the internal hidden man of the
heart, the new man is in a prosperous condition; our souls are in good
health; the work of God is comfortably carried on in us; we have sweet
and repeated experiences of the love of God; we are growing in grace,
and in the knowledge of Christ; and, like the palm tree, the more weight
is hung upon it, the more it thrives; and, like the children of Israel
in Egypt, the more they were afflicted the more they grew.

[2 Corinthians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 4:17</span></span>

For our light affliction,.... The difference between the present and
future state of the saints is here expressed, the disparity between them
shown, and the influence the one has upon the other. The present state
is a state of "affliction". Affliction is the common lot of the children
of men, but more especially of the children of God, and is here designed
by "our" affliction; for these, besides their soul trouble, meet with
such in the world, and from the men of it, others do not. Afflictions
are appointed for them by their heavenly Father; provision is made for
them, and support under them, in the covenant of grace; they are
Christ's legacy to them, and by which they are conformed to him; they
are always for their good, spiritual and eternal; and lie in their way
to heaven, through which they must pass into the kingdom: now these
their outward afflictions which are here meant, lie chiefly in the
meanness of their outward circumstances; in poverty and distress, in
disgrace, reproaches, and persecutions for their profession of Christ,
and his truths: and in opposition to this their mean and despicable
condition in the eyes of the world, their future state is signified by
"glory", as it often is in the word of God; and is of such a nature,
that all the glories of this world, such as kingdoms, crowns,
inheritances, possessions, riches, honour, and substance of every kind
and degree, by all which the heavenly state is expressed, are but faint
resemblances of it: it is the same glory Christ has entered into, is
possessed of for, and will give to all his people; it will chiefly lie
in communion with Father, Son, and Spirit, with angels, and one another;
there will be a visible glory upon the bodies of the saints, which will
be fashioned like to the glorious body of Christ; and their souls will
be blessed with perfect knowledge and holiness. Their affliction is
represented as "light" which though it is not in itself, but often very
grievous and heavy to be borne, especially when any soul trouble is
added to it; yet is light, when the saint is supported by the arm of the
Lord, indulged with his presence, and favoured with the discoveries of
his love. The afflictions of God's people are light, when compared with
their deserts, with the sufferings of Christ, the torments of the damned
in hell, and the joys of heaven, which are here, by way of opposition
thereunto, styled a "weight of glory". The apostle has respect to the
Hebrew word which signifies both "weight" and "glory", and is often used
for riches, honour, and whatsoever is excellent, solid, and substantial:
and here the phrase designs the weighty riches of glory, that massy
crown of glory which fadeth not away, that bulky and more enduring
substance, which Christ will cause them that love him to inherit. Again,
the afflictions of the children of God are said to be

for a moment; they are but for a while, and that a little while; at most
they are but for the present time of life, and that is but as a vapour
which appears for a little while, and then vanishes away; it is but as a
moment, a point of time, in comparison of eternity: but the glory the
saints are chosen and called unto, that weight of it which shall be put
upon them is "eternal", it will last for ever; it will know no end:
hence it is called an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,
an everlasting kingdom, everlasting habitations, an incorruptible
inheritance, and a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Now the present
affliction of the people of God has a considerable influence upon this;
it is said here, that it

worketh for us this glory. The Jews (y) introduce God speaking words
much like these.

"Saith the holy blessed God, I have sent them chastisements in this
world, , "to strengthen their arms for", or that their arms may lay hold
upon the world to come.''

Now afflictions may be said to work eternal glory for the saints, not by
way of merit, for they are not worthy to be compared with the glory to
be revealed; there is no proportion between them; besides, the heavenly
kingdom and glory was prepared from the foundation of the world, and is
a free grace gift of their heavenly Father; but they work as means of
enjoying it, as the word and ordinances do; the Spirit of God makes use
of them, as of the other, to work up the saints for that selfsame thing,
glory: these are means of trying, exercising, and improving their
graces, of weaning their hearts from this world, and drawing out their
desires, hope, and expectation of another; they are the way in which
believers walk to glory, and which it last issue and terminate in it;
glory follows upon them, though it is not for them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 4:18</span></span>

While we look not at the things which are seen,.... These are the things
of this world, such as riches, honours, pleasures, profits, &c. which
are visible to, and strike the senses of a natural man, and are
temporal, endure but for a time, are transitory, fleeting, and quickly
gone. To "look" at these things is to desire them, set the affections on
them, and to make the enjoyment of them a man's chief scope and aim; and
when this is the case, afflictions cannot be said to work for such, or
to work them for an eternal weight of glory; but when believers have
their eyes and hearts taken off of these things, they either look not at
them, or with contempt upon them; "while", and when they are in such
frames of soul, afflictions are operating for their future good. Or by
these things that are seen may be meant afflictions themselves, the
cross, with all that belongs to it; which also are discernible by the
outward senses, and are but for a time. Now a believer is not to stand
looking and poring upon his afflictions; for while he does so, they work
impatience, murmurings, repinings, unbelief, &c. but when and while he
looks off of these to Christ, and to what he has done and suffered, and
to the glories of another world, and to the recompense of reward, he not
only finds himself supported under his present afflictions, which he
does not so overlook as to despise; but he also finds his heart seeking
after, and his affections set upon, and his faith, hope, and expectation
raised in the views of things above, where Christ is: and so he is kept
looking

at the things which are not seen; by the corporeal eye, nor by the eye
of carnal sense and reason; only by the eye of faith, which is "the
substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen": and
these things, the joys and glories of heaven, "are eternal"; will last
for ever, will never end; all which is great encouragement to faith and
patience under the present afflictive dispensations of Providence.
