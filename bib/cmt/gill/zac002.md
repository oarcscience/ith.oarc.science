INTRODUCTION TO ZECHARIAH 2

This chapter contains a prophecy of the church under the Gospel
dispensation; of the largeness and numbers of it; and of its protection
and glory, through the presence of God in it. In this vision a man is
seen with a measuring line in his hand, to measure Jerusalem with, [Zac
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md) upon which an angel bids the angel
that talked with the prophet to declare to him the largeness,
populousness, and safety of Jerusalem, [Zac
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#003.md) then follows an exhortation to the
people of God to come out of Babylon, [Zac
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006.md) and then a promise of the calling
of the Gentiles, and of God's gracious inhabitation in his church, which
would be matter of joy to Zion; and of his inheriting Judah, and
choosing Jerusalem [Zac 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008.md) and the
chapter is concluded with an address to all mankind, to be silent before
the Lord, since he was raised up out of his habitation, [Zac
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013.md).

[Zechariah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 2:1</span></span>

I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked,.... And saw a third vision;
which, as Kimchi owns, refers to the times of the Messiah; though it
might be of use to the Jews then present, to encourage them to expect
the rebuilding of Jerusalem, in a literal sense:

and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand: by whom is meant,
not Nehemiah, nor Zerubbabel; see [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md) who were concerned in the
building of Jerusalem; nor any mere man, nor even a created angel; for,
though he may be the same with the other angel, that did not talk with
the prophet, [Zac 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#003.md) as Kimchi
observes; seeing he seems to be superior to him that did; yet not a
ministering spirit, but the Messiah, who in this book is often spoken of
as a man; See Gill on [Zac 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008.md) and by
"the measuring line in his hand" may be meant eternal predestination,
the Lamb's book of life, which is in his keeping; and is the measure and
rule by which he proceeds in the calling, justification, and
glorification of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven; or
the Scriptures of truth, the measure and rule of doctrine, discipline,
worship, and conversation; and according to which Christ forms,
constitutes, and regulates Gospel churches; see [Eze
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003.md).

[Zechariah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 2:2</span></span>

Then said I, Whither goest thou?.... As it showed great freedom and
boldness in the prophet to put such a question to the man with the
measuring reed, it was great condescension in him to return him an
answer, as follows:

and he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem; not literally understood,
which was not yet thoroughly built; but the Gospel church, often so
called; see [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md) and this
measuring of it denotes the conformity of it to the rule of God's word;
a profession of the true doctrines of it, and an observance of the
ordinances of it, as delivered in it; and an agreement of the walk,
life, and conversation of its members with it:

to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof; the
length of the New Jerusalem is as large as the breadth; its length,
breadth, and height, are equal, [Rev
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016.md).

[Zechariah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 2:3</span></span>

And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth,.... See [Zac
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#009.md) and he "went forth" from the place
where the prophet was, with whom he had been conversing:

and another angel went out to meet him: the same that was seen among the
myrtle trees, [Zac 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008.md) and here, with
a measuring line in his hand, [Zac
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md).

[Zechariah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 2:4</span></span>

And said unto him,.... That is, the other angel said to the angel that
had been talking with the prophet,

Run, speak to this young man: meaning Zechariah, who was either young in
years, as Samuel and Jeremiah were when they prophesied; or he was a
servant of a prophet older than he, and therefore so called, as Joshua,
Moses's minister, was, [Num 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#028.md) as
Kimchi observes:

saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls; this shows
that this is not to be understood of Jerusalem in a literal sense, for
that was not inhabited as a town without a wall; its wall was built in
Nehemiah's time, and remained until the city was destroyed by Vespasian;
yea, it had a treble wall, as Josephus says (b); but of the church of
Christ in Gospel times; and denotes both the safety and security of it;
see [Eze 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#011.md) and the populousness of
it; and especially as it will be in the latter day, when both Jews and
Gentiles are called, and brought into it; which sense is confirmed by
what follows:

for the multitude of men and cattle therein; the Jews being meant by
"men"; see [Eze 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#031.md) and the Gentiles
by "cattle", to which they used to be compared by the former: this will
be fulfilled when the nation of the Jews will be born at once, and all
Israel will be saved, and the fulness of the Gentiles shall be brought
in; for the number of the spiritual Israel, the sons of the living God,
both Jews and Gentiles, shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be
measured, [Hos 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md) and when there
will be such a large increase of converts; and such flockings to Zion,
to the spiritual Jerusalem, the church of God, that the place will be
too small for them, [Isa 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#019.md)
whereas, when Jerusalem in a literal sense was rebuilt, after the
Babylonian captivity, there was a want of persons to inhabit it, and
lots were cast for one out of ten to dwell in it; and they were glad of
others that offered themselves willingly to be inhabitants of it, [Neh
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md) for there was but a small number
that returned from Babylon to repeople the city of Jerusalem, and the
whole country of Judea; no more came from thence but forty two thousand,
three hundred, and threescore, besides men and maid servants, which
amounted to seven or eight thousand more, [Ezr
2:64](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#064.md) [Neh
7:66](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#066.md) which were but a few to fill such
a country, and so many cities and towns that were in it, besides
Jerusalem; and yet Josephus (c) affirms, that the number of those of the
tribes of Judah and Benjamin, that came up from thence, and were above
twelve years of age, were four millions, six hundred, and twenty eight
thousand; in which he is followed by Zonaras (d), and it is admitted and
approved of by Sanctius on the place; which is not only contrary to the
accounts of Ezra and Nehemiah, but is incredible; that such a number
that went into captivity, which was not very large, should, under all
the distresses and oppressions they laboured, in seventy years time so
multiply, and that two tribes only, as to be almost eight times more
than all the twelve tribes were at their coming out of Egypt; a number
large enough to have overrun the Babylonian monarchy; and too many to be
supported in so small a country as the land of Canaan: wherefore, upon
the whole, it must be best to interpret this of spiritual and mystical
Jerusalem, and of the populousness of the church of Christ in the latter
day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 2:5</span></span>

For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about,.....
So that she needs no other wall to secure her, the power of God
encompassing her about as the mountains did Jerusalem, [Psa
125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002.md) and he being as a wall of fire
to terrify and destroy her enemies; for our God is a consuming fire,
[Heb 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029.md). Drusius thinks it is a
metaphor taken from travellers in some countries, who kindle fires about
their tents, to keep off lions, and other beasts of prey; and observes
of lions particularly, that they are exceedingly terrified by fire; for
which he refers to John Leo in his description of Africa; and Pliny
makes (e) mention of several things that are terrifying to them, but
especially fires, he says; and so Dr. Shaw (f), of late, speaking of the
lions in Barbary, remarks, fire is what they are the most afraid of;
yet, notwithstanding all the precautions of the Arabs in this respect,
with others he takes notice of, it frequently happens that these
ravenous beasts, outbraving all those terrors, will leap into the midst
of an enclosure or fold, and drag from thence a sheep, or a goat; and
Tavernier (g) tells a story, by which he thinks it appears to be a
vulgar error that lions will not come near the fire; though the relation
itself shows it to be not only a received opinion, but a common custom
to light fires in the night, to preserve from lions: his story is,

"a party of Dutch soldiers, under the command of a serjeant, far
advanced in the country (about the Cape of Good Hope), and night coming
on, they made a great fire, as well to keep themselves from the lions,
as to warm themselves, and so lay down to sleep round about it; being
asleep, a lion seized one of the soldier's arms, which with difficulty
was got out, after the lion was shot;''

but this seems to be the case, when these creatures are dreadfully
hunger bitten; however, be it as it will, God is the sure and safe
protection of his people; who went before the people of Israel in a
pillar of a cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, when they
passed through a terrible wilderness, in which were beasts of prey; and
surrounded Elisha with horses and chariots of fire, when the king of
Syria sent a large host to take him; so that he could say, to encourage
his servant, "they that be for us are more than they that be with them",
[Kg2 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#015.md) who seem to be angels; and
the Jews (h) here interpret it of the family of God, his angels, made a
wall to Jerusalem to preserve it; the cherubim and a flaming sword, set
to keep the garden of Eden, were, according to Lactantius (i), a wall of
fire about it; for (he says), when God cast man out of paradise, he
walled it about with fire: but that was that man might not enter in; but
here he himself is a wall of fire, that his people may be safe; hence
they have no reason to fear the wrath of their enemies, the most fierce
and furious, savage and cruel, comparable to lions, bears, &c.; for, if
God is for them, on their side, and on all sides of them, who can be
against them to any purpose? The Targum paraphrases it,

"my Word shall be unto her, saith the Lord, as a wall of fire
encompassing her round about:''

and will be the glory in the midst of her: appear glorious in her, be
glorified in her, and by her, and be her glory, and make her glorious;
as the Lord does by granting his gracious presence with his church and
people, in his word and ordinances; see [Isa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md) [Isa
60:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#013.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 2:6</span></span>

Ho, ho,.... This word expresses a call and proclamation; and is doubled,
as Kimchi observes, to confirm it; and so the Targum paraphrases it,

"proclaim to the dispersed:''

come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the Lord; that
is, from Babylon, which lay north of Judea; see [Jer
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#013.md) [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md) where many of the Jews continued,
and did not return with the rest when they came up out of the captivity;
and are therefore called to come forth from thence in haste; and
figuratively designs, either the people of God that are among the men of
the world, and are called to separate from them, and have no fellowship
with there; or such as will be in mystical Babylon, a little before its
destruction; and will be called out of it, lest they partake of her
plagues; see [Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md),

for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the
Lord; meaning either the dispersion of the Jews in Babylon, and other
countries; or of the people of God, being scattered up and down in the
jurisdiction of Rome Papal; or the sense is, that it was his will and
purpose, when they were come out of Babylon, that they should be spread
in the several parts of the world, to support the cause of Christ, and
strengthen his interest.

[Zechariah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 2:7</span></span>

Deliver thyself, O Zion,.... Or make thy escape, you that belong to
Mount Zion, the city of the living God, and ought to have your abode
there, and not in Babylon: flee from thence,

that dwelleth with the daughter of Babylon; in any of the antichristian
states, who are the daughters of Babylon, the mother of harlots, [Rev
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md) so it may be rendered, "that
inhabits the daughter of Babylon" (k); dwells in any of the cities,
towns, and villages, belonging to it.

[Zechariah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 2:8</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord of hosts,.... Christ, who is the true Jehovah,
and Lord of armies, as appears from his being sent in the next clause:

After the glory; which is promised, [Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005.md) so the Targum and Kimchi; or,
"afterwards" shall be "the glory" (l); or a glorious time and state;
that is, after God's people are brought out of mystical Babylon, when
the Jews shall be converted, and the fulness of the Gentiles shall be
brought in, then will be the latter day glory; and at the same time will
be the fall and destruction of antichrist, and of the antichristian
states, as follows:

hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you; the Chaldeans and
Babylonians, who spoiled and carried captive the Jews; or the
antichristian nations, which persecuted and wasted the people of God,
the followers of the Lamb; but now Christ will be sent, and will come in
a spiritual manner, and take vengeance on them; he will destroy
antichrist with the breath of his mouth, and with the brightness of his
coming; with the sharp sword going out of his mouth, [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md),

for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye; either his own
eye, he hurts himself; or the eye of the Lord of hosts; "of mine eye",
as some read it (m), as the Vulgate Latin version; which shows how near
and dear the Lord's people are to him. The pupil or apple of the eye is
a little aperture or perforation in the middle of the tunic or coat of
the eye, called the uvea and iris, about which the iris forms a ring;
and through this little opening the rays of light pass to the
crystalline humour, to be formed on the retina or net, at the bottom of
the eye. It is a very weak and tender part, and easily hurt with the
least thing; and fitly describes the feeble state of Christ's people;
and how soon and easily they may be disturbed, distressed, and hurt by
their enemies: and as this is a principal part of the eye, and a part of
a man's self, dear and valuable to him; so are the Lord's people parts,
as it were, of himself; they are members of his body, closely united to
him; and whatever injury is done to them he reckons as done to himself:
"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" [Act
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005.md) and being highly esteemed by him,
and having the strongest affection for them, he resents every affront
given them, and will punish all that hurt them; and exceeding careful is
he of them, to keep and preserve them from being hurt: "he kept him as
the apple of his eye", [Deu 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md),
which, being such an useful and tender part as it is, it is wonderfully
provided for by nature against all events; besides the orbit in which it
is placed; and the eyebrows, which prevent many nuisances; and the
eyelids, which cover and defend it in sleep; and the fringes of hair on
them, which break the too violent impressions of light, and keep off
motes and flies; there are no less, than six tunics or coats about it
(n), as so many preservatives of it: now, as the God of nature has taken
so much care of this useful member of the human body, how much more
careful and tender must we suppose the God of grace, and our merciful
Redeemer and High Priest, to be over his dear people, parts of himself,
redeemed by his blood, and designed and prepared for eternal glory and
happiness; and how daring must such be who offer the least violence unto
them; nor must they expect to escape his wrath and vengeance, that seek
their hurt, and give them disturbance; see [Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md) and as this may respect the Jews
called out of Babylon in the two preceding verses [Zac
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006.md), it may be concluded that they
were obedient to the divine call, though it is not recorded; it being
not likely that God, who had so great a regard for them, would suffer
them to continue there to their destruction; for it was about two years
after this prophecy, in the fourth year of Darius, or the beginning of
the fifth, that Babylon revolted from him, and was besieged twenty
months by him, before he took it; and which he did at last by the
stratagem of Zopyrus, one of his generals, when he beat down its walls
and gates, and put to death three thousand of the inhabitants that were
most guilty (o); but, before this, it is reasonable to suppose that the
people of God, so dear unto him as is expressed, were called out from
hence; as those of his people, equally dear to him, will be called out
of mystical Babylon before its destruction; see [Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md).

[Zechariah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 2:9</span></span>

For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them,.... The nations; either
the Babylonian, or the antichristian states; meaning, that he would
exert his power, and inflict punishment on them, and utterly destroy
them; which would be done by the bare shaking of his hand:

and they shall be a spoil to their servants; as the Babylonians were to
the Persians; not through Cyrus, which had been done; but through
Darius, who took Babylon, after a siege of twenty months, and put great
numbers to death; and all became a spoil to the Persians, who had been
their servants: or the ten kings, that gave their kingdoms to the beast,
and were subject to him; but now shall hate the whore, and eat her
flesh; and all her riches and revenues shall be a spoil unto them, and
be divided among them, [Rev 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012.md),

and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me; either the
Prophet Zechariah, that he was a true prophet, and had his mission from
the Lord of hosts, as will appear by the accomplishment of these
prophecies; or rather Christ, sent by God the Father; and who will be
known and owned by the Jews, as well as by the Gentiles, to be the sent
of God, when they shall be converted, and antichrist shall be destroyed.
Kimchi refers this, and the following verse [Zac
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010.md), to the times of the Messiah.

[Zechariah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 2:10</span></span>

Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion,.... Or, "congregation of Zion", as
the Targum paraphrases it; the Jewish church, great numbers of that
people being converted, and in a church state; or the whole Christian
church at this time, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, who are called
upon to rejoice and sing at the destruction of antichrist; see [Rev
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020.md) and because of the presence of
God in the midst of them, as follows:

for, lo, I come; not in the flesh: this is not to be understood of the
incarnation of Christ; or of his coming in human nature to dwell in the
land of Judea; but of his spiritual coming in the latter day, to set up
his kingdom in the world, in a more visible and glorious manner:

and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord; the presence of
Christ in his churches, and with his people, in attendance on his word
and ordinances, will be very manifest and constant in the latter day.

[Zechariah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 2:11</span></span>

And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day,.... The Gospel
will be preached in all nations, and multitudes will be converted, and
embrace and profess the Christian religion, and join themselves to the
churches of Christ, which, in the New Testament, is expressed by being
joined to the Lord, [Act 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md) see [Jer
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005.md),

and shall be my people; shall appear to be so, who before were not the
people of God; did not profess themselves, and were not known to be, the
people of God, though they secretly were in the counsel and covenant of
God; but now, being called by grace, they become openly and manifestly
his people, [Pe1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md),

and I will dwell in the midst of thee; in the church, consisting of
people of many nations, as well as of Jews:

and thou shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee; to
the Jews, as well as to the Gentiles; See Gill on [Zac
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#009.md).

[Zechariah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 2:12</span></span>

And the Lord shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,.... The
Lord's people is his portion, and the lot of his inheritance; whom he
has chosen, and calls as such, whether they be Jews or Gentiles; but
here it seems to mean the believing Jews; who, it is very likely, upon
their conversion, will be returned to their own land, here called "the
holy land"; because formerly here the Lord's holy people dwelt, his holy
sanctuary was, and his holy worship and ordinances were attended on; and
where now he will possess and enjoy his people, and favour them with
communion with himself:

and shall choose Jerusalem again; after long trodden down of the
Gentiles; as it formerly was a place of divine worship, so it shall be
again; and which will be performed in it in a more spiritual and
evangelical manner than ever; or it may respect the people of the Jews,
who, being called by grace, this will be a kind of a renovation of their
election, and an evidence of it; see [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md).

[Zechariah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 2:13</span></span>

Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord,.... Be filled with fear, awe,
and astonishment, at the wonderful work of God; the destruction of
antichrist; the conversion of the Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles:
let them not open their mouths, or dare to say one word against it. The
Targum interprets the words of the wicked, and paraphrases them thus,

"let all the wicked be consumed before the Lord;''

see [Psa 104:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035.md) and it seems to design
the rest of the people, who will not be converted; called flesh, being
not only frail and mortal, but corrupt and sinful; and so not able to
contend with God, who is mighty in strength, and glorious in holiness,
and a God doing wonders. A like phrase is in [Hab
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md),

for he is raised up out of his holy habitation: which is heaven, [Isa
63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md) where he seemed to have been as
it were asleep for many hundreds of years, even during the reign of
antichrist; but now he will be as a man awaked out of his sleep, and
will arise to take vengeance on his and his church's enemies, and to
help them, and make them happy and glorious.
