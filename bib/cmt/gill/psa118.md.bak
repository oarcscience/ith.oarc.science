[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 118

Kimchi says their Rabbins are divided about this psalm. Some understand
it of David; others of the Messiah: but, with us Christians, there ought
to be no doubt of its belonging to the Messiah; since our Lord has
quoted a passage out of it, and applied it to himself, [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md); see [Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md); and so has the Apostle Peter,
[Act 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md). Nor did the Jews of those
times object thereunto, which doubtless they would have done, had the
psalm respected any other but the Messiah; yea, the common people that
attended Christ when he entered into Jerusalem, and the children in the
temple, took their "hosanna" from hence, [Psa
118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md); see [Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md). It is generally thought to be
written by David, after he was established in the kingdom, and had
brought the ark of the Lord into the city. It concludes the great
"Hallel", or hymn sung at the Jewish festivals; particularly at the
feasts of tabernacle and the passover.

[Psalms 118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 118:1</span></span>

O give thanks unto the Lord,.... For all his mercies, temporal and
spiritual; as all should, who are partakers of them: this should be done
always, and for all things, in the name of Christ; it is but reasonable
service;

for he is good; in himself, and to others: is essentially and
diffusively good; the fountain of all goodness, and the author of all
good things;

because his mercy endureth for ever; in his own heart, and in his
covenant; his grace and lovingkindness displayed in Christ; the
blessings and promises of it, which are the sure mercies of David: these
always remain, notwithstanding the unworthiness of his people; and
though he hides his face sometimes from them, and chastises them; see
[Psa 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md); the goodness and mercy of
God were seen in setting David on the throne; and abundantly more in
giving Christ to be the Saviour of his people; for both which thanks
should be given, and the kindness acknowledged, by the persons mentioned
in the following verses.

[Psalms 118:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 118:2</span></span>

Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. Let such who have
had an experience of it acknowledge and declare it to others; not only
believe in it with their hearts, and privately give thanks for it, but
with the mouth make confession of it to the glory of divine grace; not
only literal Israel, whom the Lord brought out of Egypt, led and fed in
the wilderness, and settled in the land of Canaan; and to whom the law
and the services of God, the covenants and promises, word and
ordinances, belonged; and who now were so happy under the government of
such a king as David; but also the spiritual Israel of God, the whole
Israel of God, Jews and Gentiles, under the Gospel dispensation; the
Israel whom God has chosen, Christ has redeemed, and the Spirit
effectually calls and sanctifies; such who are Israelites indeed, who
have been encouraged to hope in the Lord, and in his mercy, and are made
partakers of it; these should speak of the grace and mercy of God, and
the continuance of it, for the encouragement of others.

[Psalms 118:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 118:3</span></span>

Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. The
priests and Levites that blessed the people, and taught them the
knowledge of divine things; but not these literally, at least not only
these, since the priesthood of Aaron is changed, and the law of it
abrogated, and all believers are now priests unto God, and offer up
spiritual sacrifices to him; and particularly the sacrifice of praise
for his grace and mercy, the perpetuity of which they should publish and
proclaim all abroad.

[Psalms 118:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 118:4</span></span>

Let them now that fear the Lord say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
Not the proselytes to the Jewish religion only, but all that feared the
Lord among all people, as Aben Ezra observes; such as fear the Lord and
his goodness, and have had an experience of his grace and mercy, which
has caused them to fear him; and to whom the mercy of God is great, and
on whom it is from everlasting to everlasting; and therefore should
speak well of it, and set their seal to it, that it abides for ever; see
[Psa 103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011.md).

[Psalms 118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 118:5</span></span>

I called upon the Lord in distress,.... Or "out of that strait" (q);
when David was encompassed by Saul and his men, or when at the court of
Achish, or when his own people talked of stoning him. As this may
respect the Messiah, it may design his distresses in the garden, when
surrounded with sorrow, and being in an agony prayed the more earnestly,
and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood; and may be applied to
his members, as it often is their case to be in distress, straits and
difficulties, through outward afflictions and pressures, inward
corruptions, temptations, and desertions, and through the low exercise
of grace; when they are as it were imprisoned, and so straitened they
cannot come forth in the free exercise of it; at all which seasons
prayer is necessary; and nothing is more proper than to call upon the
Lord, which is both duty and privilege, and often attended with success,
as follows;

the Lord answered me, and set me in a large place; as he did David, when
he delivered him from all his troubles, placed him on the throne of
Israel, and gave him rest from all his enemies round about; see [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md). And so he did the Messiah, when
he raised him from the dead, received him to heaven, where he sits at
the right of God in human nature: this is a large place indeed, large
enough for the innumerable company of angels, and for all the saints,
for whom everlasting habitations and mansions of bliss are preparing by
him; and which is the glories liberty of the children of God; see [Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md); and these also, upon calling on
the Lord in distress, are heard and answered, and brought into large
places, where they walk at liberty; so at first conversion, when
distressed about their souls, and cry for help, they are answered and
brought out of the pit, and have their feet set upon a rock and their
goings established; and when at other times their grace is drawn forth
into exercise, their souls are enlarged in duty, are favoured with large
views of the love of God, with an increase of spiritual light,
knowledge, peace, and joy; and are delivered from their troubles, and
out of the hands of their enemies. Or it may be rendered, "the Lord
answered me largely" (r); as he did Solomon, when he gave him more than
he asked for; and as he does his people, when he gives them a
sufficiency, and an abundance of his grace, and even not only above
their deserts, but above their thoughts and expectations; see [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 118:6</span></span>

The Lord is on my side,.... Or "for me" (s); he was on the side of
David, hence all his prosperity and victories, the wonderful things done
by him, his exaltation to the throne, and the establishment of it; and
so he was on the side of Christ, he was near unto him, at his right
hand, to guide, direct, and assist him as man; and he is likewise on the
side of his people, to fight their battles for them, to support them
under all their afflictions, to supply all their wants, to deliver them
from all evil, to carry on the work of grace in their souls, and to
bring them to glory, The Targum is,

"the Word of the Lord is for my help.''

I will not fear: what can man do unto me? David did not; he was not
afraid of ten thousands of men, no, not of a whole army that encamped
against him, God being for him, the strength of his life, and his
salvation, [Psa 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006.md); nor did the
Messiah; he was not afraid of Herod when he was told he would kill him;
nor of the high priests, Scribes and Pharisees, though he knew he should
fall into their hands, and they would deliver him to the Gentiles, to be
scourged and crucified; nor of Judas and his band of men, who came to
take him; nor of Pilate his judge, who had no power against him but what
was given him. Nor have the saints any reason to fear what man can do
unto them, when grace is in exercise; for what is man to God, who is but
flesh, and that flesh grass? Nor can he do anything without a divine
permission; is often frustrated in his attempt; and what he is suffered
to do is overruled for good; and the utmost he can do is to kill the
body; he cannot destroy the soul, or hinder the happiness of it; see
[Psa 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md).

\(s\) "pro me", Musculus, Michaelis.

[Psalms 118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 118:7</span></span>

The Lord taketh my part with them that help me,.... With the four
hundred men that were with David, and stood by him in his troubles, [Sa1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002.md); see [Psa
54:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#004.md); and with those who ministered
unto Christ as man, [Luk 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003.md). Or, "the
Lord is for me, with" or "among my helpers" (t); he is the principal
helper, he is one for all; he is in the room and stead of other helpers;
having him, there is no need of any other: the Lord is the only helper
of his people, vain is the help of man; he helps them out of all their
troubles and difficulties, in the exercise of every grace, and in the
discharge of every duty; he helps them to all their mercies temporal and
spiritual, to grace here, and glory hereafter. The Targum is,

"the Word of the Lord is to help me;''

therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me; see "vengeance"
on them, as the Targum; which was desired by David, by the Messiah, and
by the saints; not for the sake of that itself, but for the glory of
divine justice. David saw this, [Psa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007.md); so will the Messiah, when all
his enemies, that will not have him to reign over them, will be slain
before him; and so will the people of God, when antichrist is destroyed.

[Psalms 118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 118:8</span></span>

It is better to trust in the Lord,.... This, with what follows in [Psa
118:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#009.md), is the conclusion from the
above premises and experience; it is good to trust in the Lord; such
enjoy peace, are in safety, shall not want any good thing, nor ever be
ashamed and confounded: the Targum is,

"it is better to trust in the Word of the Lord;''

than to put confidence in man; it is not good to put confidence in man
at all; it is trusting to a broken staff, to a mere shadow, which can
yield no support or relief: it is best to trust in the Lord; he is able
to help, as well as willing; he is faithful to his word, and
unchangeable in his promises; whereas man, though he may have a will to
help, oftentimes has it not in his power; and when it is in his power,
and has promised it, he disappoints, being changeable or unfaithful.
Wherefore trust not in man, but in the Lord; yea, cursed is the man that
trusts in man; see [Jer 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md).

[Psalms 118:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 118:9</span></span>

It is better to trust in the Lord,.... The Targum is,

"in the Word of the Lord.''

This is repeated for the sake of what follows:

than to put confidence in princes; who have greater ability to help, and
whose honour should engage them to keep their word; and yet it is better
to trust in the Lord than in them; see [Psa
146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md). Two different words being used
in this verse and [Psa 118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008.md); for
trust and confidence, Jarchi has observed, that the one signifies a
lesser, the other a stronger confidence; as if the sense was this, "It
is better lightly to trust in the Lord than to put the strongest
confidence in men and princes." But the observation is scarcely solid
enough.

[Psalms 118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 118:10</span></span>

All nations compassed me about,.... Not all the nations of the world,
but all the neighbouring nations about Judea; as the Philistines,
Moabites, Ammonites, Amalekites, and Syrians; and these not all at one
time, but sometimes one, and sometimes another, whom David fought with
and subdued: and these, applied to Christ, design Herod and Pontius
Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel; who were gathered
together against him, to do what God had determined should be done, [Act
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027.md); see [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md). And this is sometimes the case
of the church and people of God: at the first setting up of the interest
of Christ, the whole world was against it; and in such circumstances was
the church of Christ, when the whole world wondered after the beast, the
Romish antichrist; as it will be when the kings of the earth and of the
whole world will be gathered to the battle at Armageddon; and also when
the Gog and Magog army shall compass the camp of the saints and the
beloved city; see [Rev 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#003.md); and so
Jarchi interprets this of Gog and Magog. Yea, it is applicable to
particular believers, who are attacked by Satan, the god of this world;
and who are hated and persecuted by the men of it in general; and who
are beset on all hands, at times, with the temptations of the devil, and
the corruptions of their own hearts, and the snares of the world; that
it is as if all nations compassed them about;

but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them; that is, calling upon
the name of the Lord; as Asa, Jehoshaphat, and others did besides David:
or trusting in the name of the Lord; and so the Targum,

"in the name of the Word of the Lord I trusted, therefore will I cut
them off.''

Or, going forth in the name and strength of the Lord, as David did
against Goliath; and so against all nations that gathered together
against him, whose armies he vanquished and destroyed, and made the
nations tributary to him. Thus our Lord Jesus Christ, his antitype, as
Mediator stood in the strength and in the majesty of the name of the
Lord, calling upon him to glorify him; and, trusting in his help and
power, he attacked all his and our enemies, and obtained an entire
victory over them, to the utter demolition of them; sin, Satan, the
world, death, and hell. The word (u) used has the signification of
concision or circumcision; and may have a peculiar regard to the Jews,
who boasted of their circumcision, and were the implacable enemies of
Christ; and who were destroyed by him, when wrath came upon them to the
uttermost.

[Psalms 118:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 118:11</span></span>

They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about,.... Which is
repeated not only for the confirmation of, it, but to denote the
frequency and fury of their attacks, and their obstinate persisting
therein; See Gill on [Psa 118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md);

but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them; which also is repeated
to show the strength of his faith, and the continuance of it,
notwithstanding his numerous enemies, and their violent efforts against
him.

[Psalms 118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 118:12</span></span>

They compassed me about like bees,.... In great numbers (w); as a swarm
of bees, which, being irritated and provoked, will fly upon persons in a
body, and with great fury; to which the Amorites and the Assyrian army
were compared, [Deu 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md). They will
attack horses and kill them, as Aristotle (x) says; and places besieged
have been delivered by throwing out hives of bees among the besiegers
(y): and yet as they are feeble creatures, so by striking they lose
their sting; and either die very quickly, or however become useless. All
which denotes the numbers of the enemies of David and of Christ, and of
his church and people, and the wrath and fury of them against them, as
well as their fruitless and unsuccessful attempts upon them; for though
they rage, what they contrive and endeavour to put in execution are vain
things, and in the issue end in their own ruin and destruction;

they are quenched as the fire of thorns; which make a blaze, a noise,
for a while; but are soon consumed, and leave only a few ashes behind.
Wicked men are often compared to thorns, they being like them,
unfruitful in themselves, unprofitable to others, harmful to the saints,
and whose end is to be burnt; and whose destruction is certain and
sudden, and easily effected as the burning of thorns; see [Psa
58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009.md), [Ecc
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md). The Targum renders it,

"they burned as fire among thorns;''

which is easily kindled and soon quenched: and so the Septuagint,
Vulgate Latin, Ethiopic, and Arabic versions; as if it was expressive of
their wrath and fury, which was soon over; which agrees with what
follows:

for; or "but", or "verily" (z),

in the name of the Lord I will destroy them; See Gill on [Psa
118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md) and See Gill on [Psa
118:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#011.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 118:13</span></span>

Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall,.... Or "pushing, thou
hast pushed me (a), that I might fall": an apostrophe to some particular
enemy, as Saul was to David; who thrust sore at him to take away his
life, by casting a javelin at him; speaking to his servants to kill him;
sending messengers to watch his house and slay him, and by, pursuing him
from place to place. And such an one was Judas to Christ, who lifted up
his heel against him, and betrayed him into the hands of his enemies; or
the devil in him, and by him; and who thrust sore at Christ by others;
by Herod in his infancy, who sought to take away his life; and by the
Scribes and Pharisees, who attempted it in different ways, and at last
got him nailed to the cross; as well as Satan thrust sore at him, by his
temptations in the wilderness, and when in his agonies in the garden,
and when on the cross: and so the same enemy thrusts sore at the members
of Christ, to cause them to fall from him, and the steadfastness of
their faith in him to fail; that they may fall into temptation, and by
it into sin, and that finally and totally, and into hell itself, could
he obtain it;

but the Lord helped me; helped David, so that he perished not by the
hand of Saul, he sometimes feared he should; helped Christ, as man and
Mediator, in the day of salvation, and raised him from the dead, and
gave him glory: and he helps his people against all their enemies; holds
them with his right hand; helps them to fight against them; maintains
his own work of grace in them, and keeps them from a total and final
falling away, by his power unto salvation. The Targum is,

"the Word of the Lord helped me.''

[Psalms 118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 118:14</span></span>

The Lord is my strength and song,.... It being in the name of the Lord
the enemies of the psalmist were destroyed; and having obtained help of
him when sore thrust at, he gives him all the glory, and ascribes
nothing to himself. It was the Lord that strengthened him, helped him,
and gave him the victory. The Lord is the author and giver of strength,
natural and spiritual; he is the "strength" of the hearts and lives of
his people, and of their salvation; and therefore is their "song", the
matter of it: they sing of his nature and perfections, of his works of
providence and grace, of his righteousness and salvation, as follows:

and is become my salvation; the author of temporal, spiritual, and
eternal salvation; which the psalmist saw his interest in, and was
assured of, and therefore sung praise on that account; see [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 118:15</span></span>

The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the
righteous,.... In all the dwellings of good men, throughout the land of
Israel, was heard nothing but the voice of joy, on account of David's
accession to the throne; the deliverance of him from a persecuting Saul,
and of them from his real administration; and the victories David
obtained over all his enemies: for, "when the righteous are in
authority, the people rejoice", [Pro
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#002.md). And still much more occasion is
there of joy, in the dwelling places of the saints, though but cottages,
and in the churches of God, the tabernacles of the most High, on account
of the spiritual and eternal salvation Christ is the author of which joy
is inwardly felt in the heart, and outwardly expressed by one saint to
another; and in vocal prayer to God, and in singing his praises; which
may be done in the houses of the saints, as well as in the house of God.
What this voice, or the righteous with their voice, expressed in each of
their dwelling houses, is as follows; for the word "saying" may be
supplied, and the words connected thus:

saying, the right hand of the Lord doth valiantly; or "acts powerfully"
(b); in helping and assisting David, in protecting and defending him, in
raising him to the throne, and in giving him rest from all his enemies;
and so in supporting the Messiah, his antitype, as man and Mediator, in
his work and under his sufferings; in raising him from the dead, and
exalting: him at his right hand; and which was done with his right hand,
[Act 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033.md). Jarchi refers this joy here
expressed to future times, the times of the Messiah: and in an ancient
(c) writing of the Jews the right hand of the Lord, three times
mentioned in this verse and [Psa
118:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#016.md), is interpreted of the Messiah,
the sort of David.

\(b\) "agit strenue", Junius & Tremellius, Piscator; so Cocceius. (c)
Raya Mehimna in Zohar in Numb. fol. 64. 1.

[Psalms 118:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 118:16</span></span>

The right hand of the Lord is exalted,.... Lifted up, very eminent and
conspicuous, easily to be observed in the instances before given, and
become great and glorious in power; see [Exo
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#006.md). The power of God is superior to
all enemies; and is beyond conception and expression; and is able to do
for his people above all they are able to ask or think;

the right hand of the Lord doth valiantly: or "acts powerfully". This is
repeated for the confirmation of it, and to show how much the righteous
were affected with it, and how desirous they were of glorifying of it;
"the right hand of the Lord", being three times mentioned, may have
respect to the three divine Persons in the Godhead, whose right hand or
power is the same: and as the right hand of the Father has done
powerfully in the instances given, so the right hand of the Son has
worked mightily in vanquishing all enemies, sin, Satan, death, and the
world; in obtaining the salvation of his people, and in raising himself
from the dead: and so the right hand of the Holy Spirit has wrought
powerfully on Christ, on whom he rested as the Spirit of might, and
through whom Christ offered himself to God, and by whom he was raised
from the dead; and also in the conversion of sinners, and in helping,
assisting, strengthening, and protecting the saints.

[Psalms 118:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 118:17</span></span>

I shall not die, but live,.... Not that he should never die, David knew
he should; but that his present afflictions would not issue in death; or
he should not die by the hands of his enemies, he sometimes feared he
should; but now believed he should live, as he did, to a good old age:
he knew he should live spiritually and eternally, and not die a second
death; and so may all true believers and members of Christ say. Yea,
these words may be considered as the words of Christ; who, though he
came into the world to die, and did die for the sins of his people; yet
he knew he should not die before his time, nor should he continue long
under the power of death; but should live again, and live for evermore,
and not die; death should have no more dominion over him; see [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md);

and declare the works of the Lord; the wonderful appearances of God in a
providential way, and all his marvellous works of grace; as David did,
and as all the people of God more or less do; and which is the end of
their living; not to eat and drink, and gratify their carnal senses, but
to glorify God, by declaring what he has done for themselves and others.
So the Messiah declared the name of God, his nature, perfections, mind
and will, word and works, among his brethren in the great congregation,
[Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md).

[Psalms 118:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 118:18</span></span>

The Lord hath chastened me sore,.... Or, "in chastening hath chastened
me" (d). David was exercised with many afflictions; and though these
were sore ones to the flesh, yet they were only the chastenings of a
Father, and were all in love and for his good; as are all the
afflictions of God's people; for whom he loves he chastens. Indeed the
chastisement of the Messiah was a proper punishment for sin, and so a
sore one indeed; he being the surety of his people, on whom "the
chastisement of their peace was laid"; that is, the punishment of their
sin, [Isa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md);

but he hath not given me over unto death; as yet, or to the power of it,
so as to continue under it. This is to be understood in the sense as
before; See Gill on [Psa 118:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017.md).

Open to me the gates of righteousness,.... The doors of the sanctuary or
tabernacle, so called, because none but righteous persons might enter in
at them, or who were clean in a ceremonial sense; and because sacrifices
of righteousness were here offered. The words are addressed to the
porters, or Levites, that kept the doors of the tabernacle, to open
them. The Targum is,

"open to me the gates of the city of righteousness;''

Jerusalem, so called [Isa 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md); the
gates of which were opened to David, when he took it from the Jebusites.
An emblem of the church or city of God, the gates of which are opened to
the righteous to enter into now; and of the New Jerusalem, and of the
heavenly glory, into which the saints will have an abundant entrance
hereafter; see [Isa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md). Moreover,
these may be the words of the Messiah, requiring the gates of heaven to
be opened to him by his blood, he having obtained redemption for his
people; see [Psa 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md);

I will go in to them, and I will praise the Lord: at the gates of the
tabernacle David entered, and praised the Lord for his deliverance and
salvation, and for the many favours and honours bestowed on him; and in
the church of God do the saints praise him, as they will do in heaven to
all eternity; and where Christ, as man, is praising his divine Father,
[Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 118:20</span></span>

This gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter. This seems
to be spoken by some other person or persons, distinct from David and
the Messiah, pointing at some particular and principal gate, upon
hearing the above word: by which is meant, not the gate of the house of
the sanctuary of the Lord, as the Targum; but the Messiah himself,
afterwards spoken of as the stone rejected by the builders, and made the
head of the corner; who is the way of access to God; the door into the
church or sheepfold; the strait gate that leads to eternal life; by
which none but righteous persons enter into heaven; even such who are
made righteous, through the imputation of his righteousness to them; see
[Joh 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001.md).

I will praise thee, for thou hast heard me,.... Here the psalmist
reassumes his part in this song, and determines to praise the Lord for
hearing him when in distress, and when he was encompassed with his
enemies, and for delivering him out of their hands;

and art become my salvation; the author of it, and therefore deserving
of praise; and who is no other than the Messiah Jesus, who is described
in the next verse.

[Psalms 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 118:22</span></span>

The stone which the builders refused,.... This is not Zerubabel,
according to the sense of some Jews, as Theodoret suggests; nor the
people of Israel, as Jarchi and Kimchi; nor David, as the Targum, which
paraphrases the words,

"the child the builders despised was among the sons of Jesse, and
deserved to be appointed a king and a governor.''

He doubtless was a type of Christ, and there was some shadow of what is
here said in him: he was refused by all the tribes but Judah;
Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, was set upon the throne, though afterwards
all Israel and Judah united in making David king, [Sa2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md). But the Messiah is intended, as
some ancient Jewish writers (e) own, and Jarchi himself elsewhere (f)
confesses; and which is certain from the quotation and application of
this passage to Christ, in [Mat 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md),
[Act 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md); who is compared to a stone
for his strength and duration; and because of his usefulness in the
spiritual building of the church, as a foundation and corner stone; See
Gill on [Mat 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md). Him the Jewish
builders refused; their political ones, their rulers, that believed not
on him; the princes of this world, that rose up against him and
crucified him; even those who were the support of their civil state, and
the maintainers of it: but more especially their ecclesiastical
builders, the chief priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, who built the
people, or directed them to build on their carnal privileges, the
traditions of the elders, and their own legal righteousness. These
refused to receive Jesus as the Messiah, and to believe in him; they
refused to own and honour him as King of Zion; they refused his
doctrines and ordinances; they refused to hear him preach, or suffer
others to hear him; they refused to make use of him in the spiritual
building, either to preach him themselves, or allow others to do it;
they rejected him with contempt; they set him at nought, and preferred a
thief and a robber to him;

is become the head stone of the corner; Christ is the corner stone, that
unites elect angels and elect men together, Jews and Gentiles, Old and
New Testament saints, saints above and below, saints in all ages and
places; and he is the head stone, or chief corner stone, for strength
and beauty, and the head of the corner; or of persons most eminent, who
are sometimes called the corner, [Jdg
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#002.md). Christ is exalted above all; he
is the head of principalities and powers, the angels; he is made higher
than the kings of the earth; and is the head of the body, the church, an
head both of eminence and influence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 118:23</span></span>

This is the Lord's doing,.... This stone is from the Lord, [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md); it is of his choosing,
appointing, and laying: the rejection of it by the builders is through
his permission and will; they did no other things than what his hand and
counsel determined should be done, [Act
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md); and the exaltation of it, or the
making it the head of the corner, was of him; he highly exalted him at
his right hand, above every name, creature, and thing;

it is marvellous in our eyes; the stone itself is wonderful to look at,
for its beauty, strength, and usefulness; the wisdom, love, care, and
power of God, in laying it, are astonishing; the distinguishing grace of
God in selecting some stones out of the common quarry, making them
lively stones, and building them on this foundation stone, is exceeding
marvellous: and so are both the rejection and exaltation of it; that so
precious a stone should be refused, and, when treated with so much
neglect and contempt, should be exalted. The Targum is,

"from the Lord was this, said the builders; this is marvellous in our
sight, said the sons of Jesse.''

[Psalms 118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 118:24</span></span>

This is the day which the Lord hath made,.... Famous and remarkable for
the above events. Meaning either the day of Christ's entrance into
Jerusalem, in order to be delivered up to the Jews, and suffer and die
in the place of his people; to which the following words agree: or the
day of his resurrection (g) from the dead; when God gave him glory, and
was matter of joy to those for whose justification he rose; or the
Lord's day, kept in commemoration of it: or rather the whole Gospel
dispensation, made a bright day by the sun of righteousness; and which
is the now present day of salvation;

we will rejoice and be glad in it; because of the blessings of grace,
peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation, which came through the
humiliation and exaltation of Christ, and are published in the
everlasting Gospel. The Targum is,

"this day the Lord hath made, said the builders; let us rejoice and be
glad in it, said the sons of Jesse.''

[Psalms 118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 118:25</span></span>

Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord,.... Or, "we beseech thee"; for they
are the words of the people, wishing all health and happiness to their
king; and it is as if they had said, "vivat rex", that is, "let the king
live", or, "God save the King": and no doubt these words were used by
the people, when all the tribes united and made David king over all
Israel, and when he became the head of the corner; which was attended
with the shouts and acclamations of the people, expressing themselves
after this manner, And certain it is that these words were used by the
followers of Christ, and applied to him, when he made his public entry
into Jerusalem, crying, "hosanna" to the son of David. The word
"hosanna" is the same with "save now"; and is compounded of the two
words in the text thus translated, [Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md);

O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity; to our King: give him
success in all his undertakings, and victory over all his enemies; may
the pleasure of the Lord prosper in his hands; may his Gospel run and be
glorified, and be spread all over the world, and multitudes bow to the
sceptre of his kingdom; may his kingdom be enlarged, and his dominion be
from sea to sea; and may this spiritual building rise, and be brought to
perfection, of which he is the foundation and chief corner stone. The
allusion may be to the shouts usually made at the laying of the
foundation or corner stone of any considerable edifice, and at the
bringing in the head stone of it; see [Ezr
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011.md).

[Psalms 118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 118:26</span></span>

Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord,.... These words were
used by the multitude that followed Christ, as he went into Jerusalem,
in order to eat his last passover, and suffer and die for his people,
and are applied to him; as also by his disciples, who expressed them
thus, "Blessed be the King that cometh", &c. [Luk
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038.md); the King Messiah, who came from
heaven to earth, from his Father into this world, to save the chief of
sinners; who now came to Jerusalem on that errand, and into the temple,
as the proprietor of it; where he showed his power, and exercised his
authority: he came not in his own name, but in his Father's name; and
not to do his own will, but his; nor did he seek his own glory, but his
Father's: he came as his servant to do his work; he came with a
commission from him, by his order, and to obey his commands, which he
did; he came with his full consent and will, and, as man and Mediator,
was helped and assisted by him; and as such he is pronounced blessed:
all blessing, happiness, and honour, are wished for him, and ascribed
unto him, as his just due; being Lord and King, Saviour and Redeemer, of
his people;

we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord; these are the words of
the priests, one part of whose office it was to bless the people, [Num
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023.md); but these were not the chief
priests of the Jews in Christ's time; for they were displeased with the
multitude, and with the children in the temple, for crying "hosanna" to
the son of David, and wishing well to him, [Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md). But the disciples of Christ, or
ministers of the Gospel, who blessed the people that blessed their Lord
and Master; or wished well to them, and prayed for them that wished well
to him. The sense is, either we who are of the house of the Lord bless
you; we who stand there, and serve him, are rulers of the household of
God, and stewards of the mysteries of grace: or we bless you, and pray
for your welfare, who are of the household of faith; who are fellow
citizens with the saints, and of the household of God: or we bless you
with provisions out of the house of God; with the goodness and fatness
of his house, the word and ordinances, by administering them to you: or
we pray that the Lord would bless you out of Zion, or out of the highest
heavens, where he is; even with all spiritual blessings, in heavenly
places in Christ Jesus; see [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md). The Targum of this verse [Psa
118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md), is,

"We beseech thee, O Lord, "save" now, said the builders; We beseech
thee, O Lord, send now prosperity, said Jesse and his wife. Blessed be
he that cometh in the name of the Lord, said the builders; Let us bless
you out of the house of the sanctuary of the Lord, said David.''

[Psalms 118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 118:27</span></span>

God is the Lord, which hath showed us light,.... These are the words of
the people, acknowledging divine favours; particularly that the Lord had
caused his face to shine upon them, as the priest wished for, [Num
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025.md). The Lord might be said to show
them light, by sending the Messiah to them, who came a light into the
world; by making a Gospel day, for which they expressed their gladness,
[Psa 118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024.md); by causing the light of
his glorious Gospel to shine into their hearts; by making them who were
darkness light, the darkness of ignorance and unbelief to pass away, and
the true light to shine; by lifting up the light of his countenance upon
them, and giving them hopes of the light of glory and happiness, and
making them meet to be partakers of the inheritance with the saints in
light; for all which they are thankful, and call for sacrifices;

bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar; that
is, the lamb, as the Targum and Aben Ezra. Take a lamb for sacrifice,
and bind it with cords; and being bound, lead it to the altar; there
slay it, and then pour the blood upon the horns of it; which were the
usual rites in sacrifice. Or bring a large number of sacrifices bound,
as many as will fill the court, even up to the horns of the altar, upon
this joyful occasion: for the sacrifice was not bound to the horns of
the altar; but it denotes here such a number of sacrifices as would fill
the court, and reach thither; so Gussetius (h) interprets it very
rightly. But we are not to think of slain beasts, but of holy and living
sacrifices, even the persons of God's people; their bodies and souls,
and their sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving; since this refers to
Gospel times; whose hearts in such service are to be united to fear the
Lord, and fixed trusting in him; and are to be drawn to it with the
cords of love, which are more than all whole burnt offerings; and which
sacrifices are to be brought to the altar, Christ; which is most holy,
and sanctifies gifts and persons, and renders them acceptable to God;
and which is to be compassed about with songs of deliverance and
salvation, by persons from every quarter, the four corners of the earth.
Luther renders it,

"adorn the feast with leaves;''

and others,

"bind on the feast day branches,''

of trees, as was usual on the feast of tabernacles; see [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md); and it was usual with the
Heathens to strew their altars with green herbs and flowers (i),
particularly vervain, put for all other sweet herbs (k): hence Ovid (l)
calls them "herbosas aras"; which the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin
versions seem to countenance.

Thou art my God, and I will praise thee,.... These are the words of
David, asserting his interest in God as his covenant God; and which is
the great blessing of the covenant, and the greatest happiness of men,
and will always continue; and for which there is abundant reason for
praise: it is an instance of distinguishing grace, all evidence or
everlasting love, and the foundation of all comfort and happiness here
and hereafter;

thou art my God, one will exalt thee; in my heart, and with my lips; and
call upon others to join with me in it, as in [Psa
118:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#029.md). The Targum is,

"thou art my God, and I will confess before thee; thou art my God, and I
will praise thee, said David: Samuel replied, and said, Praise, O ye
congregation of Israel;''

who are addressed in the next words.

O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good,.... And thus the psalm ends
as it began; there having been given many instances of the divine
goodness, in hearing and delivering the psalmist when in distress;
saving him from his enemies, when compassed about with them; sparing his
life, when in great danger; and especially in making the stone rejected
by the builders the head of the corner;

for his mercy endureth for ever; the above instances are proofs of it;
and still it continues, and will for evermore. Here ends the great
"Hallel", or hymn, sung at the passover and other festivals.
