INTRODUCTION TO NUMBERS 24

In this chapter we are told, that Balaam leaving his enchantments, the
Spirit of God came on him, and he spake of the happiness of Israel, and
prophesied of their future greatness and glory, [Num
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001.md) which so exasperated Balak, that
he ordered him at once to depart from him, [Num
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010.md). Balaam justified himself in
what he said and did, and suggested that before they parted, he had
something to say in a prophetic manner, concerning what Israel should do
to Moab in "future" times, [Num 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#012.md)
and then prophesies concerning the Messiah, and the destruction of Moab,
and of some neighbouring nations, and even of some at a greater
distance, as the Assyrians and Romans, [Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md).

[Numbers 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 24:1</span></span>

And when Balsam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel,.... That
it was good in his sight, what he approved of, and was well-pleasing to
him, and that it was his determined mind that Israel should be blessed,
and not cursed, from which there was no turning him, by offering
sacrifices to him, and much less by his sorceries and divinations:

he went not as at other times; or, "as at a time in a time" (q), at two
times, of which see [Num 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003.md), he
abode in the place where the sacrifices were offered, and did not depart
to another at some distance, as he had twice before done:

to seek for enchantments; which it seems he used before, for he not only
offered sacrifices to the true God, which yet were attended with
superstitious rites, but he made use of his divining art also; and not
only went to meet with God, and hear what he would say to him, but
consulted the devil also, being willing to have two strings to his bow,
and that, if possible, he might carry his point, and get what his
covetous and ambitious mind was desirous of: the words may be literally
rendered, "to meet enchantments" (r); but what should be meant by the
phrase is not easy to say; I should rather choose to render them, "to
meet serpents", and make use of them in his divinations, make
observations on them, and predictions from them: one sort of divination
is called "ophiomancy", or divining by serpents; so Calchas, on seeing a
serpent devour eight sparrows with their dam, foretold the duration of
the siege of Troy (s):

but he set his face towards the wilderness: where the people of Israel
lay encamped, not with an intention to bless them, though he saw it
pleased the Lord, but to take an opportunity, if he could, without his
leave, to curse them; and therefore he did not go out as he did before,
to know his will, but stood by the sacrifice, with his face to the
wilderness, where the people were, to take any advantage that offered.

[Numbers 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 24:2</span></span>

And Balaam lifted up his eyes,.... Being on Mount Peor:

and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; in
that exact order in which they were directed to encamp under four
standards, and so many tribes under each standard, [Num
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001.md).

and the Spirit of God came upon him; not in his grace but in his gifts;
not as a spirit of sanctification, but as a spirit of prophecy, as the
Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan paraphrase it; and so sometimes the
Spirit of God in this sense has come upon wicked men, as on Caiaphas and
others, [Joh 11:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051.md).

[Numbers 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 24:3</span></span>

And he took up his parable,.... His parable of prophecy, as the Targums,
his prophetic speech, which, with a loud voice, he expressed in the
hearing of Balak and his nobles:

and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said; the preface to his prophecy
is pompous, and seems to be full of pride and vanity, and so the Targums
of Jonathan and Jerusalem represent him;"the man who is more excellent
than his father hath said, to whom hidden secrets, even what was hidden
from the prophets is revealed to him;''and the Jews have a saying (t)
that he that has an evil eye, a haughty spirit, and a large soul, or is
covetous, is one of the disciples of Balaam the wicked:

and the man whose eyes are open hath said; or, as some (u) render it,
whose eyes were shut, but now open; either the eyes of his body, which
were shut when the angel met him, and the ass saw him and not he, but
afterwards were open, and he saw him also; or the eyes of his
understanding blinded with ambition and covetousness, but were open to
see his mistake, at least so far as to be sensible that he could never
prevail upon God to allow him to curse Israel; or rather open, by the
spirit of prophecy coming on him, whereby he saw and foretold things to
come.

[Numbers 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 24:4</span></span>

He hath said, which heard the words of God,.... God speaking to him,
which he did several times, and with which he was greatly elated, see
[Num 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#009.md),

which saw the vision of the Almighty; not that he had a sight of any
similitude of God, though the angel that appeared to him, which was
Christ the uncreated angel, might appear in an human form, for some
visible form was seen both by the ass and him; but rather this respects
the visions of God to him in the night; it may be in a dream, as has
been already observed, and which the following words seem to confirm:

falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: or falling into a deep
sleep, and yet the eyes of his body open, which sometimes is the case
with persons asleep; or the eyes of his mind open, to receive the
instructions given him in a dream or vision of the night; unless this is
to be understood of his falling on his face, when he had his vision, as
sometimes the prophets did, see [Eze
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028.md), so the Targums of Jonathan and
Jerusalem paraphrase it; and the latter says, he prophesied of himself,
that he should fall by the sword; which is better than to interpret it
of his falling when his ass lay down with him, as some do: so men may
have a great deal of light and knowledge in their heads, and yet not
have true grace in their hearts; great gifts, which puff up with pride
and vanity, but not sanctifying grace, which is of an humbling nature,
[Co1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md), what he said under a spirit
of prophecy follows.

[Numbers 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 24:5</span></span>

How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,.... Not that the matter of which they
were made was so rich, or their structure so admirable, but the order in
which they were placed was so beautiful and agreeable:

and thy tabernacles, O Israel; which is the same thing in other words,
and which may be applied figuratively to the church of God, which often
goes by the names of Jacob and Israel; and agrees with particular
congregations and assemblies of saints, where they dwell as in tents in
a movable state, like pilgrims and sojourners; and which are the
dwelling places of Father, Son, and Spirit, and of the people of God
with one another; and are goodly, pleasant, and delightful, because of
the presence of God with them, and on account of the provisions there
made for them, and the company they there enjoy; see [Psa
84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md).

[Numbers 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 24:6</span></span>

As the valleys are they spread forth,.... Long and broad, lying between
several mountains, and reaching from hill to hill; so the armies of
Israel lay encamped in the plains and villages of Moab, making a very
considerable length and breadth; the camp of Israel is said to be twelve
miles long, and twelve miles broad; so the Targum on [Num
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003.md) and this may denote the lowness of
the saints and people of God in their own eyes, and their largeness in
themselves; and especially when the place of their tents shall be
enlarged, and the curtains of their habitations be stretched forth in
the latter day; and also their fruitfulness, meads, and valleys
abounding with herbs and flowers, as the churches of God do with the
fruits of the Spirit, grace, and righteousness, and with plants of the
Lord's right hand planting. Some render it as brooks and torrents of
water, so the Targum of Jonathan; which diffuse and spread themselves,
and on the banks of which stand beautiful trees in goodly order:

as gardens by the river's side: laid out in a delightful manner, full of
flowers, plants, and trees, and well watered; like to these, in several
spots, were the people of Israel formed into several camps; and to these
may the churches of God be compared, who are distinguished and enclosed
by sovereign grace, full of trees of righteousness of the Lord's
planting, watered by the river of divine love, and from Christ the
fountain of gardens; see [Sol 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012.md),

as the trees of lign aloes, which the Lord hath planted: which are not
planted and raised by the art and industry of man, but grow up without
culture, as the mere produce of nature, under a divine providence; these
are called lign wood or tree aloes, to distinguish them from another
sort of aloes, which are no other than plants; but these are what the
Indians call Calambra or Calembac, and, physicians Xyloaloes and
Agallochium, and are of a very aromatic and fragrant scent. This tree is
said to be about eight or ten feet high; at the head of it is a large
bunch of leaves, which are thick and indented, broad at bottom, but
growing narrower towards the point, and about four feet in length; the
blossom of it is red, intermixed with yellow, and double like a pink;
from this blossom comes fruit, round like a large pea, white and red;
the juice of these leaves is drawn out by cutting them with a knife, and
received into bottles; the smell of the wood is exquisite (w). P. Martyr
(x) speaks of a trunk of lign aloes, which being cut, a sweet savour
proceeds from it. It may be observed what Isidore (y) remarks, that it
grows in Arabia, as well as in India, and so might be well known to
Balaam. And to these the Israel of God may be compared for their
fragrancy, being clothed with the righteousness of Christ, all whose
garments smell of or like these aloes, [Psa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008.md) and having the graces of the
Spirit of God in them, the smell of which is preferable to all spices,
and they themselves are signified by the same, [Sol
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#010.md),

and as cedar trees beside the waters; which are tall and high, large and
spreading, durable lasting, to which the righteous are compared; see
Gill on [Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md).

[Numbers 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 24:7</span></span>

He shall pour the water out of his buckets,.... That is, God shall
plentifully send down rain out of the clouds upon these valleys,
gardens, and trees, and make them fruitful; and this may be a figure of
the grace of God, with which his churches are watered, and become
fruitful by means of the word and ordinances, which is conveyed through
them out of the fulness which is in Christ:

and his seed shall be in many waters; the seed and offspring of Israel
shall be in a place of many waters, in a land of brooks and waters,
shall dwell in a well watered land, the land of Canaan, [Deu
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007.md) or shall be like seed sown near
water, or in well watered places, which springs up and brings forth much
fruit, see [Isa 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#020.md) or shall become,
or be over many waters, to which people, kingdoms, and nations, are
sometimes compared; and so may denote the multitude of Israel, and the
large extent of their dominions, see [Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md),

and his king shall be higher than Agag; who might be the then present
king of Amalek, reckoned one of the greatest kings on earth; and this
name, some think, was common to all the kings of Amalek, as Pharaoh to
the kings of Egypt; and according to Jarchi and Aben Ezra, this is a
prophecy of the first king of Israel, Saul, and of his conquering Agag
king of Amalek, for there was one of this name in his time, [Sa1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007.md),

and his kingdom shall be exalted; that is, the kingdom of the people of
Israel, as it was more especially in the days of David and Solomon; and
will be abundantly more in the days of the Messiah, when his kingdom
shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth,
and the kingdoms of this world shall become his, and he shall reign over
all the earth; and so the Jerusalem Targum,"and the kingdom of the King
Messiah shall become very great;''and so other Jewish writers (z) refer
this prophecy to the days of the Messiah.

[Numbers 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 24:8</span></span>

God brought him forth out of Egypt, he hath as it were the strength of
an unicorn,.... Here he repeats what he had said in a former prophecy;
see Gill on [Num 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022.md), he shall eat
up the nations his enemies: the seven nations of Canaan, which should be
subdued by Israel, and that with as much ease as a lion devours its
prey; nor would the Canaanites be able to make any more resistance to
them than a creature in the paws of a lion; and the phrase denotes the
utter destruction of them:

and shall break their bones; as the lion breaks the bones of such
creatures that fall a prey to him; signifying that all their strength
should be taken from them, their mighty men slain, and their fortified
cities taken:

and pierce them through with his arrows: slay them utterly.

[Numbers 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 24:9</span></span>

He couched,.... Which may respect the posture of the armies of Israel in
the plains of Moab:

he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion; as he would do, and did in
the land of Canaan, when conquered by Israel; they took up their
residence on it quietly, and dwelt in it securely, and in no more fear
of their enemies than a lion, which lays itself down and sleeps without
concern anywhere:

who shall stir him up? who dare do it? as it would be a very rash, bold,
daring, and dangerous thing to rouse up a lion lying down; so it is
suggested it would be alike to provoke Israel to war at some certain
times, in the days of David more especially:

blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee;
which are the very words in which Isaac blessed Jacob, the ancestor of
these people, [Gen 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md) and which
blessing is confirmed by Balaam against his will, and whereby he cursed
himself instead of Israel; for though he could not curse him with words,
he had cursed him in his heart, and would have done it verbally if he
could (a).

[Numbers 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 24:10</span></span>

And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam,.... He had bore much and
long, but he could bear no longer, he was quite impatient, his last
words more especially must exceedingly nettle him:

and he smote his hands together; as expressive of his indignation,
vexation, and disappointment:

and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse my enemies; he had
sent princes to him, one set of them after another, to invite him into
his country, and to his court, with great promises of reward to curse
Israel, whom he reckoned his enemies, and not to bless them:

and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times; done
nothing else but bless them with blessing upon blessing, time after
time; even everyone of the three times he opened his mouth, as Balak
expected, to have cursed them.

[Numbers 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 24:11</span></span>

Therefore now flee thou to thy place,.... His own country, from whence
Balak had sent for him, and he came; begone directly, make all haste
away; he speaks as one so provoked, that he could not bear him in his
presence, and as threatening him if he did not at once get out of his
sight:

I thought to promote thee unto great honour; to bestow much wealth and
riches upon him, and to prefer him in his court to high offices of
honour and dignity; he had promised that he would, and he thought as he
said, he was determined upon it, had he performed as he expected:

but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honour; the Lord thou hast so
much talked of, and at whose beck and command thou hast been, and by
whom thou hast been checked and controlled, he has hindered thee from
riches and honour; see what thou hast got, or rather lost, by hearkening
to him, and how he will pay thee for it.

[Numbers 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 24:12</span></span>

And Balaam said unto Balak,.... In order to mitigate his wrath, and
bring him into a better temper:

spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me: those
that came to him a second time; for to the first he said nothing of what
is after related, but to the last he did much the same as he had
afterwards said to Balak himself: saying,

[Numbers 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 24:13</span></span>

If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold,.... Which are
the very words he said to the princes of Moab, [Num
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#018.md),

I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord, to do either good or
bad; for though here it is the "commandment", and there the "word" of
the Lord, yet it is the same word in both places in the original text:
indeed, here he omits the relation to the Lord he there claims, saying
"my God"; and instead of "little or great", here it is "good or bad",
but the sense is the same: and he adds, for explanation sake:

of mine own mind: or out of my heart, which was disposed well enough to
serve Balak, but was laid under a restraint by the Lord:

but what the Lord said, that will I speak; and he had not only said this
to the messengers, but to the king himself, and therefore he thought,
that as he had openly and honestly told him this at first, he had no
reason to be so angry with him; see [Num
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#038.md).

[Numbers 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 24:14</span></span>

And now, behold, I go unto my people,.... According to thine order, I
shall not stay to make thee uneasy with my company, only I crave thy
patience to hear me a little before we part:

come therefore, and I will advertise thee; about some things that shall
come to pass in future time, respecting this people, and thine, and
other nations, both near and remote; and he hoped by this to bring him
into a better temper, and part good friends: or "I will counsel thee";
what thou shall do, as the Targum of Onkelos, and so makes a sentence of
this of itself, independent of, and distinct from what follows,
beginning the next clause thus:

and I will show them what this people, &c. referring the former to the
counsel Balaam gave to Balak, how to seduce the people into idolatry;
and the Targum of Jonathan expresses it at large;"come, I will counsel
thee, go and prepare victualling houses, and place lewd women there to
sell food and drink at a low price, and bring this people to eat, and
drink, and be drunken; and let them lie with them, and deny their God,
and they will be delivered into thine hands in a little time, and many
of them will fall;''which advice was followed, [Num
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md) and is referred to, [Num
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016.md) but though Balaam did give him
such advice before he left him, which is highly probable, yet it is not
what is intended here, since what follows is closely connected with the
above clause, and contains the thing he advertised or advised him of:

what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days; not what the
Moabites should do to the Israelites now, as the Vulgate Latin version,
quite contrary to the original text, but what the Israelites should do
to the Moabites in future times; not only in the times of David, by whom
they were subdued, [Sa2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md) but in
much later times, even in the times of Alexander, or King Jannaeus, who
overcame them, as Josephus (b) relates. Now this might be said to Balak
to make him easy, that it would not be until the latter days, many
hundreds of years hence, ere the people of Israel would fight with Moab,
and subdue it; and therefore he need be under no concern about them,
since he would meet with no trouble from them in his time, nor his
people for years to come.

[Numbers 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 24:15</span></span>

And he took up his parable, and said,.... In this and the following
verse; the same preface, in the same words, is made to his prophecy as
before; see Gill on [Num 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md), [Num
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004.md); only one clause is added, "and
knew the knowledge of the Most High"; that Balaam had some knowledge of
God is certain from the names by which he calls him, being such that he
made himself known by to the patriarchs, and by which he is frequently
called in the sacred writings; but then this knowledge of his was merely
notional and speculative, and not spiritual and supernatural, and was
such as men may have who are destitute of the grace of God: he was one
that professed to know him in words, but in works denied him, see [Co1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002.md) and he also was admitted to much
nearness to God, and converse with him, of which he boasted; but then
this was not for his own sake, or as a mark of friendship to him, but
for the sake of the people of Israel, and to prevent his doing them
mischief. His prophecy follows.

[Numbers 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 24:17</span></span>

I shall see him, but not now,.... Meaning not Israel, for he now saw him
encamped, and at no great distance; but one that should descend from
him, a famous and excellent person, and who is no other than the
Messiah, as appears by what follows; him he should see, not spiritually
with an eye of faith, nor corporeally with his bodily eyes in his state
of incarnation, but at the day of judgment; and now, indeed, he saw him
by a spirit of prophecy:

I shall behold him, but not nigh; signifying, that the coming of this
illustrious Person, who should smite the borders of Moab, was not near,
and therefore Balak had no reason to indulge any present fears; and that
when he was come either into the world to save men, or to judgment,
Balaam would have no nearness to him, nor interest in him; he would see
him at the last day, but not for himself, as Job says he should, [Job
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md).

there shall come a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of
Israel; which Aben Ezra interprets of David, though he says many
interpret it of the Messiah; and there are some writers, both Jewish and
Christian, that understand it partly of David, and partly of Christ, and
chiefly of him, and of David as a type of him; the fulfilment of which
was only in part in David, but principally and completely in Christ.
Maimonides (c) parts the prophecy between them: the whole undoubtedly
agrees with Christ, and belongs unto him: the "star" and "sceptre" may
be considered as names and titles of the Messiah; he is called the
"morning star", [Rev 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md) for his
glory, brightness, and splendour, and for the light that comes by him,
and the influence of his grace, and the blessings of it on the sons of
men; and hence a false Messiah took the name of Bar Cochab, the son of a
star, to answer to this prophecy; and he may be called a "sceptre", that
is, a sceptre bearer, because of his royalty; he not only has the name
of a king, but has a kingdom, both of nature, providence, and grace, and
rules with a sceptre of grace, mercy, and righteousness; and as he was
to spring from Jacob or Israel, so he did, being a son of Abraham, a
descendant of Jacob, of the tribe of Judah, and family of David, [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md), but I rather think that the star
is to be considered as a sign and circumstance of his coming, and that
the words may be rendered, "when a star steers its course from Jacob",
or "unto Jacob, then a sceptre", or "sceptre bearer":

shall rise out of Israel, or "rise up unto Israel"; for the particle
sometimes signifies "unto" (d); and that the appearance of a star in
Israel was a sign of the Messiah's coming is certain from [Mat
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md) of which the Magi were informed by
Zoroastres (e) their founder, who, being of Jewish extract, had got it
from this prophecy of Balaam; and it is as evident that the Jews
expected the appearance of an extraordinary star at the time of the
Messiah's coming; for so they say more than once, in an ancient book of
theirs (f), that when the"Messiah shall be revealed, a bright and
shining star shall arise in the east;''which expectation must be founded
on this prophecy:

and shall smite the corners of Moab; not only the corners of their
houses and cities, but the extreme parts and borders of the land, even
all the sides, and the whole of it; or the princes and great men of the
land, sometimes called "corners", see [Zac
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004.md) and so the Targums of Onkelos and
Jonathan:

and shall kill the princes of Moab or the mighty ones of Moab, as the
Jerusalem Targum; this was literally fulfilled in David, [Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md) [Psa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md) and figuratively and mystically
in Christ, by subduing his enemies, signified by Moabites, as being the
enemies of Israel; either by reducing them through the power of his
grace to obedience to him, or by smiting and breaking them in pieces
with a rod of iron; and which will be more plainly and fully
accomplished when he shall destroy those Moabites, the antichristian
nations, [Rev 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md).

and destroy all the children of Sheth; some take Sheth to be the name of
some famous king among the Moabites, as Grotius; others, the name of
some city of Moab, which David utterly destroyed, as R. Nathan (g);
others suppose some particular nations are meant, as either the
Edomites, so called because they put confidence in their foundations,
and fortified places, so Vitringa (h); or the Egyptians, from Seth or
Sethos, one of their kings, who was known by the name Egyptus, as a late
learned writer (i) of ours conjectures; but rather by the children of
Seth are meant all nations, as Jarchi observes, for all come from Seth,
the son of the first man; and so the words may be rendered, as they are
by Onkelos,"he shall rule over all the children of men;''which will be
fulfilled in Christ, when he shall have put down all rule and authority,
and all will be subject to him, and his kingdom be from sea to sea, and
his dominion from the river to the ends of the earth; unless rather by
the children of Seth are meant the special people of God, in distinction
from others, and in allusion to the distinction between the Sethites and
Cainites, the one being the people of God, the other not; and so it may
be interpreted of Christ's gathering them to him, by clucking as it were
for them, as a hen gathers her chickens; so the word is used in Jewish
writings, and of God himself; for it is said (k) the holy blessed God
clucks over them, as hens do, which is the simile our Lord himself uses,
[Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md) the Targums of Onkelos and
Jonathan interpret this prophecy of the Messiah by name; and so do many
other Jewish writers, both ancient (l) and modern (m).

And Edom shall be a possession,.... Of the children of Israel, which was
fulfilled in part when the Edomites became the servants of David, [Sa2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014.md) and when they were smitten and
spoiled by Judas Maccabeus,them a great overthrow, and abated their
courage, and took their spoils.'' (1 Maccabees 5:3)and still more so
when all the Edomites or the Idumaeans were subdued by Hyrcanus, and
they became one people with the Jews, and conformed to their religious
rites; which is not only related by Josephus (n), but by Strabo (o), an
Heathen historian, who says, that they joined themselves to the Jews,
and embraced their laws: but in a spiritual sense this has had a greater
accomplishment in the calling of the Gentiles, and introducing them into
the church of God; see [Amo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md)
compared with [Act 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014.md).

Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; which was a mount in
the land of Edom where Esau formerly dwelt, and so signifies the same as
before: and also that the most strong and fortified places of the land
should fall into the hands of their enemies; See Gill on [Oba
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017.md), [Oba
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#018.md), [Oba
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#019.md).

Israel shall do valiantly; in fighting with and conquering the Edomites,
or shall get much wealth and riches by the spoil of them, see [Psa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009.md). This, and the following verse,
are in some ancient writings of the Jews (p) interpreted of the times of
the Messiah.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 24:19</span></span>

Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion,.... Meaning either
David, or rather the Messiah; and so Jarchi interprets this of another
ruler out of Jacob, even of the Messiah, of whom it is said, he shall
have dominion from sea to sea; [Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md),

and shall destroy him, that remaineth of the city; chief city of Edom,
or of any of the cities of it, signifying that there should be none
left, see [Oba 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#018.md), this is also
applied to the days of the Messiah, in the ancient writings of the Jews
(q).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 24:20</span></span>

And when he looked on Amalek,.... The country of Amalek, which lay to
the south of the land of Canaan, [Num
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029.md) and which Balaam had a view of
from the mountain of Peor, where he now was:

and he took up his parable, and said; the parable of his prophecy, as
the Targum of Jonathan, and pronounced it aloud:

Amalek was the first of the nations; not the first nation in the world,
nor the chief and principal for numbers, riches, or strength, but the
first that made war with Israel, as all the three Targums paraphrase it,
as they did, see [Exo 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md),

but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever; this was threatened
to them by the Lord upon that battle, and is confirmed by this prophecy
of Balaam: and after this, orders were given to Israel to blot out their
remembrance, [Deu 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019.md), and which, in
a good measure, though not completely, was done in the times of Saul,
[Sa1 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#008.md) and after that they were
distressed by David, [Sa1 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#009.md) and the
rest of them were smitten by the sons of Simeon, in the days of
Hezekiah, [Ch1 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041.md), after which we
hear of them no more: Amalek may be considered as a type of antichrist,
the son of perdition, who shall go into it, shall come to his end, and
there shall be none to help him; which will be true of all the
antichristian party, the enemies of Christ, who will be destroyed by
him, and perish eternally; see [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045.md).

[Numbers 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 24:21</span></span>

And he looked on the Kenites,.... Not the family and posterity of
Jethro, as Aben Ezra, Jarchi, and Abendana; for they were not a people
by themselves, but were now encamped with Israel, and went with them
into the land of Canaan, and were not carried captive with the ten
tribes, though some might that dwelt in Naphtali, [Jdg
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004.md), for they after that remained with
Judah under the name of Rechabites, [Jer
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#002.md) and returned with the two tribes,
being carried captive with them, [Ch1
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055.md) but they were a people, though of
the same original and family Jethro descended from, which dwelt near,
and afterwards among the Amalekites, and therefore were seen by Balaam,
and taken notice of at the same time they were; see [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md). Abarbinel takes them to be the
same with those in [Gen 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019.md).

and took up his parable; or prophecy concerning them, and delivered it:

and said, strong is thy dwelling place, and thou puttest thy nest in a
rock, they dwelling in craggy rocky places, where they thought
themselves secure and out of danger; and this their habitation he calls
"Ken", a nest, in allusion to their name Kenites.

[Numbers 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 24:22</span></span>

Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted,.... Though they were so
strongly fortified, and closely immured and surrounded with rocks and
mountains, yet they should gradually waste away, as they were but few in
Saul's time, [Sa1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md).

until Ashur shall carry thee away captive; Tiglathpileser, king of
Assyria, when he carried captive the people of Syria, took these with
them, [Kg2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md), though Jarchi thinks
they were carried captives with the ten tribes, that is, by Shalmaneser,
king of Assyria; and the Targum of Jonathan, by Sennacherib, king of
Assyria; and others think by Nebuchadnezzar, who was sometimes reckoned
a king of Assyria; taking them to be the same with the Amalekites, who
were carried captives and returned with the two tribes.

[Numbers 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 24:23</span></span>

And he took up his parable, and said,.... Or delivered another prophecy,
having made some little pause:

alas, who shall live when God doeth this? referring not to what goes
before, but to what follows; though Jarchi and Aben Ezra think it refers
to the Assyria conquering and carrying captive, not only the Kenites,
but all the nations of the world, so that there was no living
comfortably in it on his account; but this is said after Balaam had
taken up his parable again, and so respects what follows, as the
destruction of the Persian empire by Alexander, in which Ashur or the
Assyrians were included; and the destruction of the Jews by the Romans
more especially; which was such as had not been the like from the
beginning of the world, [Mat 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021.md),
and perhaps may have a further respect to the affliction of the
witnesses and church of Christ by antichrist; see [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md).

[Numbers 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 24:24</span></span>

And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim,.... Kittim was the son
of Javan, [Gen 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#004.md) and so designs
some part of Greece: Josephus (r) says that Kittim possessed the island
now called Cyprus, in which was a city now called Citium, after his
name; Macedonia, a considerable part of Greece, is called the land of
Cittim,"And it happened, after that Alexander son of Philip, the
Macedonian, who came out of the land of Chettiim, had smitten Darius
king of the Persians and Medes, that he reigned in his stead, the first
over Greece,'' (1 Maccabees 1:1)"Beside this, how they had discomfited
in battle Philip, and Perseus, king of the Citims, with others that
lifted up themselves against them, and had overcome them:'' (1 Maccabees
8:5)but the Targum of Jonathan interprets it, of the country of Italy;
the Jerusalem Targum, of the Roman legions; and perhaps both Greeks and
Romans are intended, and so ships from Cittim, in [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md), design Romans in Grecian ships;
for in such were the Roman ambassadors carried, who distressed
Antiochus, king of Syria; see Gill on [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md); and both may be intended here:
it is affirmed (s) that Noah with his son Japheth, came into the country
now called Italy, and built a city, and gave it the name of Cethim,
since called Volterra, and was the metropolis of Etruria, and gave name
to all Italy; and that in the year two hundred and twenty from the
building of that city, Cethim the son of Javan, and grandson of Noah,
took two colonies with him, and sailed to an island which he called
after his own name Cethim, now Cyprus:

and shall afflict Ashur; which being a part of the Persian empire, was
afflicted, conquered, and subdued by Alexander the Macedonian, who is
said to come out of the land of Cittim,"And it happened, after that
Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came out of the land of
Chettiim, had smitten Darius king of the Persians and Medes, that he
reigned in his stead, the first over Greece,'' (1 Maccabees 1:1)

and shall afflict Eber; or the Hebrews, as the Septuagint version; not
that the Grecians or Macedonians should do this, for they under
Alexander did not afflict the Jews; unless this is to be understood of
the Seleucidae, the kings of Syria, the successors of Alexander, who did
distress the Jews; but rather this respects the Romans under Pompey, and
especially under Titus Vespasian, who destroyed their city, and carried
them captive, and who ever since have been dispersed among the nations:

and he also shall perish for ever: not Eber, but those that afflicted
him, even the Romans; and indeed both monarchies, Grecian and Roman, are
prophesied of as what should be destroyed, and that by a son of Eber,
the Messiah; the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, said to
break in pieces all these kingdoms, [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md) and not Rome Pagan only, but Rome
Papal also, antichrist and all the antichristian powers, [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md). and so the Targum of Jonathan
says, that the end both of the one and the other, that is, that shall
afflict Eber, shall be, to fall by the hand of the King Messiah, and
they shall perish for ever.

And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place,.... The country
from whence he came, that is, he went from Balak, according to his
command, in order to return to his own land; for he seems not to have
reached it, but stayed by the way among the Moabites and Midianites, and
was slain in a battle between Israel and them, [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008.md), or if he did reach Mesopotamia,
he returned again, as Chaskuni says; and either before he left Balak, or
in his journey homewards, or when he returned, he gave that advice, to
seduce the Israelites first to whoredom, and by that to idolatry, the
effects of which are observed in the following chapter; see Gill on [Num
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014.md) and Balak also went his way; to
his royal city, court, and family, attended, very probably, by the
princes of Moab, who had been with him all this while; though how long
these things were transacting is not certain.
