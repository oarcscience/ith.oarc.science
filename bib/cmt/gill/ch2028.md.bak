### [2 Chronicles Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 28:1</span></span>

Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign,.... These verses are
much the same with [Kg2 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002.md), only in
[Ch2 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002.md) it is said,

he made also molten images for Baalim; the several Baals or idols of the
nations round about, as well as served Jeroboam's calves; see [Jdg
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md), and he is said in [Ch2
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003.md),

to burn incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom; to Molech, the god
of the Ammonites, who was worshipped there. See Gill on [Kg2
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002.md), [Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003.md), [Kg2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#004.md).

[2 Chronicles 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 28:5</span></span>

Wherefore the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of
Syria,.... Whose name was Rezin, [Kg2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md), though that is an after
expedition to this, which is there related. The Lord is called the God
of Ahaz, because he was so of right; he had dominion over him, and ought
to have been worshipped by him; and, besides, he was so by virtue of the
national covenant between God and the people Ahaz was king of; and
moreover, Ahaz professed he was his God, though in an hypocritical
manner, and he forsook the true worship of him:

and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives,
and brought them to Damascus; whereas in a later expedition, related in
[Kg2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md), they did not succeed:

and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel; whose
name was Pekah:

who smote him with a great slaughter; as is next related.

[2 Chronicles 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 28:6</span></span>

For Pekah son of Remaliah,.... Who was at this time king of Israel:

slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all

valiant men; a great slaughter to be made at one time, and of valiant
men, but not so great as that in [Ch2
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#017.md),

because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers; this was not a
reason with Pekah for slaying them, he himself being an idolater, but
why the Lord suffered them to be slain by him.

[2 Chronicles 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 28:7</span></span>

And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son,....
Who therefore must have escaped being burnt in the valley of Hinnom, or
only was caused to pass through the fire there, [Ch2
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003.md),

and Azrikam the governor of the house; steward or treasurer in the
king's house, in the same office as Sheban was, [Isa
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015.md).

and Elkanah that was next to the king: prime minister of state.

[2 Chronicles 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 28:8</span></span>

And the children of Israel carried captive of their brethren two hundred
thousand women, sons and daughters,.... Which was a very large and
unusual number to be carried captive; but having made such a slaughter
of the men, and the rest being intimidated thereby, it was the more
easily done:

and took away also much spoil from them; wealth and riches out of their
cities, and even from Jerusalem; for by the preceding verse it seems as
if they came thither:

and brought the spoils to Samaria; or rather "towards Samaria" (k), as
some render the word; for they were not as yet come to it, nor did they
bring it and their captives thither, see [Ch2
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#015.md).

\(k\) "versus Samariam", Piscator, Rambachius.

[2 Chronicles 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 28:9</span></span>

But a prophet of the Lord was there, whose name was Oded,.... Not the
same that was in the time of Asa, [Ch2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001.md),

and he went out before the host that came to Samaria; that was coming
thither; he went out of Samaria to meet them:

and said unto them, behold, because the Lord God of your fathers was
wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand; he let them
know it was not owing to their wisdom and conduct, their prowess and
courage, that they had got the victory over them, but because the Lord
was displeased with them for their sins, and therefore gave them up into
their hands:

and ye have slain them in a rage that reaches up unto heaven; that is,
with an exceeding great rage and fury, and the cry of which reached to
heaven also, and was displeasing to God; he suggests to them, that they
had exceeded all bounds, and had not shown that compassion to their
brethren, when fallen into their hands, they ought to have done, and
which therefore was resented by the God of heaven, see [Zac
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015.md).

[2 Chronicles 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 28:10</span></span>

And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for
bondmen and bondwomen unto you,.... As seemed by taking and bringing
captive such a number of them, contrary to the law, [Lev
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md).

but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the Lord your
God? for which they deserved to be chastised as well as their brethren
the men of Judah, and might expect it, and especially if they used them
in a barbarous manner, and contrary to the will of God.

[2 Chronicles 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 28:11</span></span>

Now hear me therefore,.... And not only hear, but be obedient:

and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken of your brethren;
their women, sons and daughters, even all of them, the whole 200,000:

for the fierce wrath of God is upon you; hangs over your heads, and will
fall upon you, unless you do this.

[2 Chronicles 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 28:12</span></span>

Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim,.... Of the
principal men of the ten tribes, whose names follow:

Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and
Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up
against them that came from the war; who were bringing the captives and
spoils to Samaria; but these princes, being influenced by what the
prophet said, hindered their proceeding any further.

[2 Chronicles 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 28:13</span></span>

And said unto them, ye shall not bring in the captives hither,.... That
is, into Samaria, near which it seems they now were:

for whereas we have offended against the Lord already; by exceeding in
their cruelty against their brethren of Judah, as well as by worshipping
the calves:

ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: by making slaves
of those they had taken captives, which was against the express law of
God:

for your trespass is great; which they had committed already, by their
idolatrous practices:

and there is fierce wrath against Israel; which they perceived by what
the prophet had said.

[2 Chronicles 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 28:14</span></span>

So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and
the congregation. Which were come out of Samaria to meet them; such an
effect had the word's of the prophet, and the princes, upon them, that
they not only left the captives with them, but the spoil, to dispose of,
as they thought fit.

[2 Chronicles 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 28:15</span></span>

And the men that were expressed by name rose up,.... Either those before
named, [Ch2 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012.md) as Jarchi, and so
the Vulgate Latin version; or such as they pitched upon, nominated, and
appointed:

and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked
among them, and arrayed them, and shod them; put clothes on their backs,
and shoes on their feet, who either were taken or carried away before
they could put on their garments, or had been stripped of them:

and gave them to eat, and drink, and anointed them; not only fed them,
being hungry and thirsty, but anointed them for refreshment after
travelling; the Targum is, "washed them", from dirt and filth contracted
by travelling:

and carried all the feeble of them on asses; women and children that
were not able to walk afoot so far back again:

and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren;
a city on the borders both of Judah and Israel, and famous for the
number of palm trees near it, see [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md) in all which these inhabitants of
Samaria acted the part of the good Samaritan, [Luk
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#033.md),

then they returned to Samaria: the prophet, with the princes, and the
army, and the whole congregation.

[2 Chronicles 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 28:16</span></span>

At that time did King Ahaz send to the kings of Assyria to help him. To
Tiglathpileser, and his son, see [Kg2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md), and the Septuagint, Vulgate
Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, read in the singular, and so the
Targum.

[2 Chronicles 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 28:17</span></span>

For again the Edomites had come,.... As in the days of Jehoshaphat, [Ch2
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md),

and smitten Judah, and carried away captives; taking the advantage of
the weak and low condition Ahaz was in, and which was the reason of his
sending to the king of Assyria.

[2 Chronicles 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 28:18</span></span>

The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country,....
Which lay nearest to them, as Sharon, Lydda, Joppa, &c. in revenge of
what Uzziah had done to them, [Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md), and of the south of Judah; they
penetrated as far as that, from the west to the south of the land:

and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho, with
the villages thereof and Timnah with the villages thereof; of which see
[Jos 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010.md).

and Gimzo also, and the villages thereof; which though nowhere else
mentioned in Scripture, yet we frequently read in Jewish writings (l) of
Nahum, a man of Ganizu, which perhaps is the same place with this:

and they dwelt there; kept them in their hands, and inhabited them.

\(l\) T. Bab. Taanith, fol. 21. 1. Sanhedrin, fol. 108. 2, &c.

[2 Chronicles 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 28:19</span></span>

For the Lord brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel,....
Because of his impieties and idolatries, which the people by his example
went into; he is called king of Israel, because he walked in the ways of
the kings of Israel, and because he ruled over two of the tribes of
Israel, and of right was king over all Israel, as David and Solomon his
ancestors were; though the Vulgate Latin, Septuagint, and Syriac
versions, read, king of Judah; and so the Targum: "for he made Judah
naked"; stripped them of their religion, and the worship of God, and so
of the divine protection, whereby they were exposed to their enemies,
see [Exo 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025.md) the Targum is,"for the
house of Judah ceased from the worship of the Lord;"

transgressed sore against the Lord; by committing gross idolatry the
same Targum is,"they dealt falsely with the Word of the Lord.''

[2 Chronicles 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 28:20</span></span>

And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him,.... Not to Jerusalem,
but to Damascus, where he made a diversion in his favour, and took that
city, and where Ahaz met him, [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md).

and distressed him, but strengthened him not; exhausted his treasures,
and laid a tribute upon him, but did not help him against the Edomites
and Philistines, or recover for him the cities they had taken from him;
and, in taking Damascus, he served himself more than Ahaz, and paved the
way for seizing upon the ten tribes.

[2 Chronicles 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 28:21</span></span>

For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord, and out of
the house of the king, and of the princes,.... A part out of the
treasures of the temple, and a part out of his own treasures, and
another which he levied upon his nobles:

and gave it unto the king of Assyria; sent it to him as a present, to
engage him on his side, and assist him against his enemies, [Kg2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md).

but he helped him not; See Gill on [Ch2
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020.md).

[2 Chronicles 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 28:22</span></span>

And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the
Lord,.... By increasing his idolatries, as appears by what he did, in
imitation of what he saw at Damascus, where he had an interview with the
king of Assyria, [Kg2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md)

this is that King Ahaz; that monster of iniquity, than whom there was
none worse, nor any so bad, of all the kings of Judah.

[2 Chronicles 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 28:23</span></span>

For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him,.... As he
foolishly imagined, that they might do him no more hurt; as it is said
of the Indians, that they worship the devil, that he may not hurt them;
but that a king of Judah should do this is monstrous stupidity; rather
therefore the meaning may be, that he worshipped the gods of those that
smote him, those of the men or soldiers of Damascus (m) see [Ch2
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005.md) for the Spirit of God would never
ascribe the smiting of him to idols, though he himself might:

and he said, because the gods of the kings of Syria help them; which
looks as if this was before Damascus was taken by the king of Assyria,
and when Rezin king of Syria prevailed over Ahaz:

therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me; against the
Edomites and Philistines; wherefore rather to this, his idolatry,
respect is had in [Ch2 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md),

but they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel; the worship of them
was the cause of all the calamities that came upon that part of Israel
of which he was king.

\(m\) So Junius & Tremellius, Piscator.

[2 Chronicles 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 28:24</span></span>

And gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces
the vessels of the house of God,.... And converted them to his own use,
sold them, or melted the gold and silver, of which they were, and made
money of them, his treasures being exhausted:

and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord: that the people might
not come and worship there, but on the high places he made:

and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem; that the priests
might sacrifice there, and not in the temple.

[2 Chronicles 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 28:25</span></span>

And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto the
gods,.... The gods of Damascus, and other idols; this he did to prevent
their coming to Jerusalem to worship.

[2 Chronicles 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch2 28:26</span></span>

Now the rest of his acts,.... Of these two verses; see Gill on [Kg2
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#019.md); see Gill on [Kg2
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#020.md).
