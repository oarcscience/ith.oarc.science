### [Mark Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001.md)

[Mark 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 11:1</span></span>

And when they came nigh to Jerusalem,.... The Syriac and Ethiopic
versions read, "when he came nigh"; that is, Jesus; though not without
his disciples, nor the multitude:

unto Bethphage and Bethany; two places so called, near Jerusalem:
Bethphage began where Bethany ended, and reached to the city itself. The
Vulgate Latin only makes mention of Bethany; See Gill on [Mat
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md).

At the Mount of Olives; near which, the above places were:

he sendeth forth two of his disciples; perhaps Peter and John.

[Mark 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 11:2</span></span>

And saith unto them, go your way into the village,.... Either of Bethany
or of Nob. The Ethiopic version renders it "the city", and so reads a
copy of Stephens's: some have thought the city of Jerusalem is intended,
but without any reason; See Gill on [Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md);

over against you. The Syriac and Persic versions read, "over against
us": the sense is the same; for Christ and his disciples were together:
this suits with either of the above mentioned places:

and as soon as ye be entered into it; are come to the town's end, and to
one of the first houses in it,

ye shall find a colt tied: Matthew says, "an ass tied, and a colt with
her", [Mat 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md); both no doubt true:

whereon never man sat; which had never been backed and broke, and which
makes it the more wonderful, that Christ should choose to ride upon it,
and that that should quietly carry him:

loose him, and bring him; that is, away to me.

[Mark 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 11:3</span></span>

And if any man say unto you,.... As very likely they would, and it would
be strange if they should not say something to them, especially the
owners of it:

why do ye this? Why do ye untie the ass, and attempt to carry it away,
when it is none of your own, and it belongs to another man?

Say ye that the Lord hath need of him; our Lord and yours, the Lord of
heaven and earth, and all things in it; it looks as if this title, "the
Lord", was what Jesus was well known by; see [Joh
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#028.md); unless it can be thought, that
the owners of the colt were such, that believed in Christ, as is not
improbable; and so would at once understand by the language who it was
for, and let it go:

and straightway he will send him, hither; as soon as ever he hears that
the Lord, by whom he would presently understand Jesus, wanted him for
his present purpose; he will send him with all readiness and
cheerfulness, without the least hesitation, or making any dispute about
it.

[Mark 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 11:4</span></span>

And they went their way,.... The two disciples went to the village,
where Christ sent them, without objecting any difficulties that might
present, in the execution of these orders:

and found the colt tied by the door without; in the street, fastened to
the door of the owner's house, at the town's end:

in a place where two ways met; to go into and out of the village; at the
corner house, where two ways met; so that the place was very public, and
such an affair could not be transacted, without being seen:

and they loose him; as soon as ever they came to the place, they
immediately began to untie the colt, and were going away with him.

[Mark 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 11:5</span></span>

And certain of them that stood there,.... The Ethiopic version reads,
who walked there; who were either standing hard by, or walking about the
place, being inhabitants of it; and either the owners of the colt, or
their servants, or both:

said unto them, what do ye loosing the colt? What do ye mean by it? do
you intend to take the colt away? what business have you with it? what
right have you to do so? and what is your end in it?

[Mark 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 11:6</span></span>

And they said unto them,.... The very express words,

even as Jesus had commanded: not that these were the words they said,
but "the Lord hath need of him": upon which they said no more, were
satisfied and contented, that they should untie the colt, and take it
with them:

and they let them go; and the colt with them, very freely; See Gill on
[Mat 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#006.md).

[Mark 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 11:7</span></span>

And they brought the colt to Jesus,.... Where he was,

and cast their garments on him; their clothes to be instead of a saddle,
for Christ to sit upon:

and he sat upon him; or "Jesus rode on him", as the Syriac version
renders it. The Ethiopic version reads, "they made him to mount him";
that is, the disciples assisted him in getting upon it, and having
mounted it, he sat on it without any trouble, though it had never been
backed before, and rode on his way to Jerusalem; See Gill on [Mat
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#007.md).

[Mark 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 11:8</span></span>

And many spread their garments in the way,.... Instead of carpets to
ride on, and in honour to him as a king:

and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way;
in token of joy, as at the feast of tabernacles; See Gill on [Mat
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#008.md).

[Mark 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 11:9</span></span>

And they that went before, and they that followed,.... They that came
from Jerusalem to meet him, and they that followed him from Jericho and
other parts; which two bodies, the one went before him, and the other
followed after him: and

cried, saying, Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
Lord; See Gill on [Mat 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md).

[Mark 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 11:10</span></span>

Blessed be the kingdom of our father David,.... It was more usual with
the Jews to call Abraham their father; but, because the Messiah was
David's son, therefore, with respect to him, they here call him their
father: and their meaning is, let the kingdom promised to our father
David, and to his seed for ever,

that cometh in the name of the Lord; which is now coming, and appears in
the auspicious reign and government of his son, the Messiah, who is
clothed with majesty and authority; be prosperous and successful and be
established, and endure for ever; to the glory and happiness of him as
king, and of all the subjects of it. Unless the words should be
rendered, as by their situation they may be, thus, "blessed be the
kingdom that cometh in the name of the Lord, of our father David"; and
the sense be, let the kingdom of the Messiah, which is now come, and is
set up in his name, who, as God, is David s Lord, greatly flourish, and
long continue; may its king be blessed, and all its subjects happy. The
Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, leave out the
clause, "in the name of the Lord"; it is also left out in Beza's ancient
copy, and in another; but the Ethiopic version retains it, reading it
"in the name of God". It is added,

Hosanna in the highest: See Gill on [Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md).

[Mark 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 11:11</span></span>

And Jesus entered into Jerusalem,.... this public manner, riding upon an
ass, with the multitude attending hin, some going before, and others
after, crying, "Hosanna" to him:

and into the temple; which he rode up directly to; the Vulgate Latin,
Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, leave out the copulative "and";
his great concern being there; and having dismounted, and dismissed the
colt, and sent it by proper persons to the owner of it, he went into the
temple, into the court of the Gentiles; where he found and overturned
the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
and healed the lame and the blind:

and when he had looked round about upon all things; that is, in the
temple, as the Lord and proprietor of it; and made a thorough visitation
of it, and search into it, and corrected what was amiss in it:

and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve;
having spent great part of the day in reforming abuses in the temple, in
healing diseases, and disputing with the chief priests and Scribes: the
evening being come, he did not think fit, for some reasons, to stay in
the city; but went out to Bethany, which was near two miles off, and
lodged there; See Gill on [Mat 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017.md).

[Mark 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 11:12</span></span>

And on the morrow,.... The next day early in the morning,

when they were come from Bethany; Christ, and his twelve disciples. The
Syriac and Persic versions read, "when he came out of Bethany"; though
not alone, but with the twelve disciples, who went with him there, and
returned with him, as appears from [Mar
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#014.md), as he and they came out of that
place early in the morning, having ate nothing, before they came from
thence,

he was hungry; See Gill on [Mat 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#018.md).

[Mark 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 11:13</span></span>

And seeing a fig tree afar off,.... By the wayside, at some distance
from him:

having leaves; very large and spreading, which made a great show, as if
there might be fruit on it:

he came; unto it; either he went out of his way to it, or having seen it
before him a good way off, at length came up to it

if haply he might find any thing thereon; that is, any fruit; for he saw
at a distance, there were leaves upon it; and which was the more
remarkable, since it was the time of the fig tree just putting forth its
tender branches, leaves, and fruit:

and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; no fruit at all
upon it, contrary to his expectation as man, and the promising
appearance the tree made:

for the time of figs was not yet; or, "for it was not the time of figs";
for the word "yet", is not in the text: and the words seem rather to be
a reason, why Christ should not have expected fruit on it, than that he
should: but the sense is, either because the time of gathering figs was
not come; and since therefore they were not gathered, he might the
rather hope to find some on it; or because it was not a kind season for
figs, a good fig year; and this tree appearing in such a flourishing
condition, might raise his expectation of finding fruit, yet he found
none but leaves only; because it was so bad a season for figs, that even
the most promising trees had none upon them: or this, tree being of an
uncommon sort, though Christ expected to find no fruit on other trees,
because the time of common: figs was not come, yet he might hope to,
find some on this. Some critics neglecting the accents, render the
words, "where he was, it was the season of figs"; See Gill on [Mat
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019.md).

[Mark 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 11:14</span></span>

And Jesus answered and said unto it,.... The fig tree; a Jewish way of
speaking, often used when nothing before is said; the Syriac, Arabic,
and Persic versions, leave out the word "answered", as they do also the
word "Jesus"; and which is likewise omitted by the Vulgate Latin, though
the other is retained:

no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever; which is all one, as if he
had said, as the other evangelist does, let no fruit grow on thee; for
where no fruit is, none can be had, or eaten of. This tree may not only
be an emblem of the Jewish people, who made a great show of religion,
and enjoyed a great many privileges; and from whom, speaking after the
manner of men, the fruits of good works, righteousness, and holiness,
might have been hoped and looked for; when instead thereof, there was
nothing but talk about them, and an observance of some insignificant
rites and traditions of the "elders"; on which account, utter ruin and
destruction ensued; but also of any outward professor of religion, who
enjoying the means of grace, and making great pretensions to devotion
and piety, it might be expected that he should do good works, well
pleasing to God, and bring forth fruit to the glory of his name: whereas
he only talks of good works, but does none; at least, no fruits of grace
and righteousness are to be found on him; and at the last day, he will
be cast as dry wood, as a withered branch, into everlasting burnings,
being fit fuel for them.

And his disciples heard it; "this saying", as the Persic version adds,
and took notice of it, being in company with him.

[Mark 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 11:15</span></span>

And they came to Jerusalem,.... The Ethiopic version reads, "he came";
that is, Christ; but not alone, for his disciples were with him: Beza
says, that, one exemplar he had met with, adds "again", and so one of
Stephens's copies; for they had been there the day before:

and Jesus went into the temple: the Syriac and Persic versions add, "of
God"; into the court of the Gentiles, as he did the preceding day:

and began to cast out them that bought and sold in the temple, and
overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that
sold doves; which was done, as Matthew relates, the same day that he
made his public entry into Jerusalem: wherefore it is highly probable,
that upon Christ's leaving the city, they returned "again", and were the
next morning sitting and doing business in the temple as before; and
were drove out again by Christ, who, upon his return, found them there.
They "that bought and sold in the temple", were those that bought and
sold lambs for the passover, which was now at hand; and the sheep and
oxen for the "Chagiga", or feast the day following; as well as doves
hereafter mentioned, for new mothers, and such as had fluxes: and that
part of the temple where this business was carried on, was in a large
space within the area of the temple, where shops were built for that
purpose: and by "the money changers", whose "tables" are said to be
"overthrown", are meant, such as sat at tables to receive the half
shekel, who changed those that brought whole shekels, or foreign money:
and who had so much for changing, which was called "Kolbon"; from whence
they had the name of "Collybistae", in the text: and "doves", as before
observed, were the offering of the poorer sort of women after birth, at
the time of their purification, and of profluvious persons; of which
many came from all parts, at the time of the passover: upon which
account, there was a great demand for these creatures; and many sat upon
seats to sell them, which Christ overturned; See Gill on [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md).

[Mark 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 11:16</span></span>

And would not suffer that any man,.... He was more strict and severe
than the day before; and gave orders, that they should be so far from
being allowed to sit and trade in that sacred place, that no man

should carry any vessel through the temple; should make a, thoroughfare
of it, by carrying through to any other place, any vessel that was for
common use, or any sort of burden whatever: and this they could not well
find fault with, nor complain of, since it was agreeable to one of their
own canons; for they say (h),

"a man may not go into the mountain of the house, with his staff (in his
hands); nor with shoes (on his feet); nor with his girdle, and his money
in it; nor with a bag thrown over his shoulders; nor with dust upon his
feet; nor might he make it, "a thoroughfare", and much less spit in
it.''

\(h\) Misn. Beracot, c. 9. sect. 5. Vid. T. Bab. Beracot, fol. 62. 2. &
Yebamot, fol. 6. 2. & Midrash Kohelet, fol. 70. 3. & Maimon. Hilch. Beth
Habbechira, c. 7. sect. 1, 2, 3.

[Mark 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 11:17</span></span>

And he taught, saying unto them, is it not written,.... In [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md).

My house shall be called of all nations, the house of prayer? For not
only the Jews went up to the temple to pray, see [Luk
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#010.md), but the Gentiles also, who
became of the Jewish religion, and had a court built for that purpose;
and so the whole temple, from hence, was called an house of prayer: and
the meaning is, not only that it should be called so by the Gentiles,
but that it should be so to them, and made use of by them as such.
Jarchi's note on the clause in [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md) is, "not for Israel only, but
also for the proselytes."

But ye have made it a den of thieves; for no other, in our Lord's
esteem, were the buyers and sellers of sheep, oxen, and doves, and the
money changers, and the priests that encouraged them, and had a profit
out of them: now these had their seats, shops, and tables, within the
mountain of the house; and even in that part of it, which was assigned
to the Gentiles, the nations of the world, who became proselytes, and
came up to Jerusalem to worship there at certain times; See Gill on [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013.md).

[Mark 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 11:18</span></span>

And the Scribes and chief priests heard it,.... The reproof he gave to
the money changers, and buyers, and sellers in the temple; and his
strict prohibition that none should carry any vessels through it; and
the argument he used from the prophecy of Isaiah, and the sharp rebuke
he gave for the profanation of the holy place:

and sought how they might destroy him: they took counsel together to
take away his life, for they hated reformation:

for they feared him; lest he should go on to make great changes and
alterations among them, which would affect their credit and character,
and their gains also, and draw the people after him:

because all the people were astonished at his doctrine; both as to the
matter of it, which were such words as never man spake; and, as to the
manner of it, being with such majesty, power, and authority, as the
Scribes and Pharisees taught not with; and also at the miracles, by
which it was confirmed, as well as at the reformation and discipline he
was introducing; which was done with such an air of sovereignty and
power, as was amazing.

[Mark 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 11:19</span></span>

And when even was come, he went out of the city. Of Jerusalem, as he did
the evening before, and for the same reasons: probably he went to
Bethany, where he had lodged the last night, with Lazarus, Martha, and
Mary; or to the Mount of Olives, where he sometimes spent the night in
prayer: the Syriac version renders it, "they went out"; for Christ took
his disciples with him, as is evident from the following verse.

[Mark 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 11:20</span></span>

And in the morning, as they passed by,.... The fig tree; when they
returned the next morning from Bethany, or the Mount of Olives, or the
place, wherever it was, they had been that night:

they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots; they did not see it
immediately wither as it did, nor could they see it, as they went from
Jerusalem to this place, because it was then in the evening; but in the
morning, as they came along, they observed it; not only that the tender
branches and boughs of it, but the trunk and body of the tree, and even
the roots of it, were all dried up; so that it was entirely dead, and
there was no room ever to expect it would revive, and bear any more
fruit.

[Mark 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 11:21</span></span>

And Peter, calling to remembrance,.... Not so much the tree, and its
spreading leaves, and the greatness of it, and the flourishing condition
it was in, the other day, as the imprecation of Christ upon it:

saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is
withered away; which he observed, as matter of astonishment, and as an
instance of Christ's surprising power and authority; See Gill on [Mat
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#020.md).

[Mark 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 11:22</span></span>

And Jesus answering, saith unto them,.... To all the disciples; for what
Peter said, he said in the name of them all; and according to Matthew,
the disciples said, "how soon is the fig tree withered away?" To which
this is an answer; though the Arabic version renders it, "to him"; as if
the words were directed particularly to Peter:

have faith in God; or "the faith of God", so the Vulgate Latin, Syriac,
Persic, and Ethiopic versions; that is, exercise, and make use of that
faith which has God for its author, which is the work of God, and of his
operation, a free grace gift of his; and which has God for its object;
and is supported by his power, and encouraged by his goodness, truth,
and faithfulness: and so the Arabic version renders it, "believe in
God"; not only that such things may be done, as the drying up a fig
tree, but those that are much greater.

[Mark 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 11:23</span></span>

For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this
mountain,.... The Mount of Olives, at, or near which they now were,

be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; that is, of Galilee,
which was nearest, and yet many miles off:

and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things
which he saith shall come to pass; not only as to removing a mountain,
and casting it into the sea, but any thing equally difficult;

he shall have whatsoever he saith: whatever he commands shall be done;
See Gill on [Mat 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021.md).

[Mark 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 11:24</span></span>

Therefore I say unto you,.... For encouragement in prayer more
particularly, without which nothing should be attempted, and especially
which is above the power of nature, and is of a miraculous kind:

whatsoever things ye desire when ye pray; that is, according to the
revealed will of God, is for the confirmation of his Gospel, and for the
glory of his name:

believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them; the petitions that
are desired, and the things asked in them: that is, be as much assured
of having them, as if you had already received them, and you shall have
them; for the sense can never be, that they should believe they received
them before they had them; this would be a contradiction in terms; and
Beza's ancient copy, and one of Stephens's copies read it, "believe that
ye shall receive", as in [Mat 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#022.md),
and so the Vulgate Latin version; with which agree the Arabic and
Ethiopic versions, which render it, "believe that ye shall enjoy", or
"obtain"; and the Syriac version, "believe that ye are about to
receive"; and great faith it is so to believe; and this is the prayer of
faith; see [Jo1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md).

[Mark 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 11:25</span></span>

And when ye stand praying,.... Are about to engage in that work, or are
engaged in it, performing it in such a posture; for standing was an
usual posture in praying; See Gill on [Mat
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005.md);

forgive, if ye have ought against any, that your Father also in heaven
may forgive you your trespasses. The sense is, that if, while a man is
praying, it comes into his mind that such an one has committed a
trespass against him, has done him an injury, of which he has just
reason to complain; but instead of complaining of it before God, and
calling upon him to avenge his cause, he should immediately in his
heart, and from his heart, forgive him, even though he is not present to
acknowledge his sin, and ask his pardon; and such an one may expect
forgiveness of God, and a manifestation of it to his soul; which is one
the things he is constantly praying for, as his daily case makes it
necessary: not that it is to be understood as though his for, giving the
person that has offended him, is the cause, or condition, of his
receiving remission of sin at the hand of God; for then it would not be
through the blood of Christ, and according to the riches of his grace;
but this points at a temper and disposition of mind well pleasing to
God, and describes persons who may expect this favour from him; See Gill
on [Mat 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md).

[Mark 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 11:26</span></span>

But if ye do not forgive,.... Freely and fully, such as have trespassed
against you, remit the debts they owe, and pass by the offences and
injuries done you, and put up with every affront and indignity:

neither will your heavenly Father forgive your trespasses; that is, such
persons do not appear to have any true, or right notions of forgiveness;
nor is there any evidence that their hearts are duly affected, or truly
impressed with a sense of it; nor can they, upon their own principles
and conduct, expect it: not but that to whomsoever God stands in the
relation of a Father, and they are his children by adopting grace; these
he pities and pardons, Christ's sake; the same covenant which contains
the blessing of adoption, provides for pardoning mercy, and a
non-remembrance of sin; the same persons that are predestinated to the
adoption of children by Christ, and whom he has redeemed, that they
might receive it, have the forgiveness of their sins, according to the
riches of God's grace; for redemption and forgiveness of sins go
together; and as many as are the children of God by faith in Christ, by
the same faith receive the remission of sins; and without a view of
pardon through the blood of Christ, a child of God cannot draw nigh to
its heavenly Father, with that boldness, and cheerfulness, and filial
fear it should; but there is forgiveness with him, that he may be
feared; to whomsoever God stands in the relation of a Covenant God and
Father, to them he manifests himself as a God pardoning iniquity,
transgression, and sin: unless the word "father" here not to be taken
for such a special relation of grace, but only as expressive of him as
the God of nature and providence, who has made; and takes care of all
his creatures; in which sense he is the Father of all: as it is said,
"have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?" [Mal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010.md); and so "our heavenly Father", or
"our Father" which is in heaven, may be so called only from the place
where he dwells; and not from the grace he bestows on men, making them
partakers of his heavenly gifts and calling, and blessing them in
heavenly places, or things in Christ Jesus: in the former view of him it
will not necessarily follow, that he does forgive sin, whereas under the
latter consideration of him it will; for forgiveness is one of the
heavenly gifts and things which he blesses his children with; See Gill
on [Mat 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#015.md).

[Mark 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#027.md)

And they come again to Jerusalem,.... The Persic and Ethiopic versions
read, "he came", which must be understood with his disciples; for they
never parted from him till he was apprehended in the garden. Luke says,
[Luk 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md), that it was "on one of
those days"; and the Persic version here reads, "on another day": it was
the day after the cursing of the fig tree, and two days after his public
entrance into Jerusalem:

and as he was walking in the temple; not alone, but his disciples with
him, and a multitude of people, whom he was teaching and preaching the
Gospel to, as he walked to and fro; and whilst he was there employed,

there come to him the chief priests, and the Scribes, and the elders:
the Jewish sanhedrim; for of these that great council of the nation
consisted; See Gill on [Mat 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md).

[Mark 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 11:28</span></span>

And say unto him, by what authority dost thou do these things?.... Enter
into the temple, as if he was Lord of it; and correct in such a
magisterial way every thing he thought an abuse in it; do the miracles
he did, as healing the lame, and blind; and take upon him to instruct
the people, a work he was now engaged in:

and who gave thee this authority to do these things? See Gill on [Mat
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md).

[Mark 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 11:29</span></span>

And Jesus answered and said unto them,.... Being not in the least
intimidated by such a body of men:

I will also ask of you one question; or "one word", or "one thing"; here
answers to the Hebrew word which signifies both "word" and "thing":

and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things;
See Gill on [Mat 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#024.md).

[Mark 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 11:30</span></span>

The baptism of John,.... The doctrine of which he was the first
preacher, and the ordinance of which he was the first administrator:

was it from heaven, or of men? was it of divine or of human institution?

answer me; directly and plainly, without any shuffling, or evasion: it
is a fair question, and may be answered; and the answer to it our Lord
suggests would naturally lead to a proper one to their question; See
Gill on [Mat 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#025.md).

[Mark 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 11:31</span></span>

And they reasoned with themselves saying,.... Privately; perhaps, they
withdrew at a little distance for a short time, and consulted among
themselves what answer to return; and the amount of their reasonings
were this;

if we shall say from heaven, he will say, why then did ye not believe
him? that is, should they say that John had a divine commission for what
he said and did, they were aware that Christ would reply, why did not ye
give credit to him? and had you done so, seeing he testified of me, you
would have had no occasion to have put the above question; See Gill on
[Mat 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#025.md).

[Mark 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 11:32</span></span>

But if we shall say, of men,.... That John's baptism was an human
invention, and he had no authority from God to preach and administer it,

they feared the people; lest being enraged thereby they should, at once,
rise up, and destroy them:

for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed; a real prophet,
one truly sent from God, and had his commission and credentials from
him: this was the general sentiment of the people; See Gill on [Mat
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#026.md).

[Mark 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 11:33</span></span>

And they answered and said unto Jesus,.... Being reduced by this dilemma
to the greatest streight and difficulty;

we cannot tell: they could, if they would, but they did not care to
tell; they knew if they did, they should expose themselves one way or
other:

and Jesus answering, saith unto them, neither do I tell you by what
authority I do these things; See Gill on [Mat
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#027.md).
