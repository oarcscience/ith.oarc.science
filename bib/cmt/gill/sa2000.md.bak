INTRODUCTION TO 2 SAMUEL

This book, in many copies of the Hebrew Bible, is carried on without any
new title put unto it; the reason of it is, because, by some, this, with
the preceding, has been reckoned but one book: hence the Jews say (a),
Samuel wrote his book, not his books; in others it is called Samuel
Second; and by the Vulgate Latin the Second Book of Samuel, which we
call the Second of Kings; though why his name should be put to it at all
I see not, since it neither concerns him, nor could it be written by
him, being an history of events after his death. The Greek version calls
it the Second of Kings; and the Syriac version, the Second Book of the
Kings of Israel; whereas there is but one king of Israel it makes
mention of, and of whose actions only it is an history; and therefore
with greater propriety it is called, as the Arabic version, the Book of
David the Prophet, of whose reign, from the beginning to the end of it,
it gives an account: wherefore Isidore (b) thinks it was written by
David; and if so, it has this mark of simplicity and integrity, that the
writer does not spare himself, nor conceal his own faults, and
particularly that very capital one, the affair of Bathsheba, and also
his numbering of the people; but it is most probable that it was written
by Nathan and Gad (c), see [Ch1 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029.md);
but whoever was the penman of it, there is no doubt to be made of its
being written by inspiration, or that it is canonical; which has never
been questioned, since there stands in it a famous prophecy concerning
the building of the temple by a son of David, which had an exact
accomplishment, [Sa2 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md); as well as
of the family of David, for a great while to come, which also was
fulfilled, [Sa2 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#019.md); and an eminent
passage concerning the Messiah, the son of David, and of his divine
sonship, [Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md); quoted by the
Apostle Paul in proof of it, [Heb 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md).
It contains an history of about forty years, for so long David reigned,
seven years and six months in Hebron, over Judah, and thirty three years
in Jerusalem, over all Israel and Judah; and this book relates his last
words.
