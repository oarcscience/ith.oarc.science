### [Psalms Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 17:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 17

A Prayer of David. This prayer was put up by David either in his own
person, on his own account, praying to God for the vindication of his
cause, and for salvation and deliverance from his enemies; or in the
person of the Messiah, whose type he was, and of the whole church, so
Jerom of old interpreted it; and the title of it in the Arabic version
is,

"a prayer in the person of a perfect man, and of Christ himself, and of
everyone that is redeemed by him;''

in which preservation and protection are prayed for, and hope of eternal
life is expressed. It was written, according to Theodoret, when David
suffered persecution from Saul.

[Psalms 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 17:1</span></span>

Hear the right, O Lord,.... The psalmist appeals to the Lord as a Judge,
sitting on the throne judging right, that he would hear his cause
litigated between him and his adversaries, determine and give the
decisive sentence about it; so Christ committed himself to him that
judgeth righteously, [Pe1 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023.md); for by
"right" may be meant his right and cause, or his righteous cause, as in
[Psa 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#004.md); unless rather his righteous
prayer should be intended, so the Targum paraphrases it, "my prayer in
righteousness"; not presented for the sake of his own righteousness, but
on account of the righteousness of Christ, and for the vindication of
his righteous cause before men: the Vulgate Latin, Ethiopic, and Arabic
versions, render it "my righteousness", meaning his righteous cause; but
rather the word may be rendered "righteousness" (z), or the "righteous
one", and may design the psalmist himself, who was a righteous person,
and such the Lord hears; or Christ, whose name is the Lord our
righteousness, [Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md); and who, as
an advocate or intercessor for himself and for his people, is Jesus
Christ the righteous, [Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md). The
Septuagint version takes it to be an epithet of the Lord himself,
translating it, "O Lord of my righteousness", as in [Psa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md); and so the Syriac version, "hear,
O holy Lord"; and in this manner does Christ address his father in
prayer, [Joh 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011.md); and the
consideration of the holiness and righteousness of God is of use in
prayer to glorify God, and to command a proper awe and reverence of him;

attend unto my cry; the word for "cry" signifies both a noise made in a
way of joy and grief; wherefore the Chaldee paraphrase renders it,
"attend to my praise", or hymn of praise, and which arises from sorrow
and distress; and intends not mental prayer attended with groanings
which cannot be uttered, but vocal prayer expressed in a loud and
mournful manner, signifying the distress the person is in, and his
earnestness and importunacy for help; and of this sort were some of
Christ's prayers; see [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md);

give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips;
hypocritical and deceitful ones; but this went forth from his heart,
which was lifted up with his hands to God, to whom he drew nigh with a
true heart, and called upon him in the sincerity and uprightness of his
soul; and of this sort were all Christ's prayers, in whose mouth there
is no guile: the various expressions, "hear, attend, give ear", which
signify the same thing, show the distress the supplicant was in, the
fervency of his prayer, and his vehement and earnest desire to be heard
and answered immediately; and since the accent "athnach" is upon the
word "my prayer", this last clause is not to be joined only to that, but
refers to all that is said before; as that his "right" and his "cry", as
well as his prayer, were unfeigned.

"justitiam", i.e. "me qui sum justus", Piscator.

[Psalms 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 17:2</span></span>

Let my sentence come forth from thy presence,.... Not of condemnation,
such as came forth from God and passed on Adam and all his posterity,
[Rom 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012.md); though such an one was
executed on Christ, as he was the surety and representative of his
people; but of justification, which came forth from God and passed on
Christ, when he rose from the dead, and upon his people in him, [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md). Here it chiefly designs the
vindication of the innocence of the psalmist before men; and his request
is, that as he was fully persuaded that he was clear of the things he
was charged with in the sight of God, that he would openly and publicly
make him appear so before men; that he would bring forth his
righteousness as the light, and his judgment as the noonday, [Psa
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006.md); and of which he made no doubt
but he would; so Christ, though he was traduced by men, knew he should
be justified by his Father, and by his children, [Isa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008.md);

let thine eyes behold the things that are equal; which is not to be
understood barely of the eyes of his omniscience; for these behold
things both equal and unequal, good and evil, things which agree and
disagree with the law of God, the rule of righteousness and equity; but
of his approbation of them, and that he would some way or other testify
that approbation; for the petition intends the favouring of his just and
equal cause, and making it to appear to be so.

[Psalms 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 17:3</span></span>

Thou hast proved mine heart,.... This properly belongs to God, who is
the searcher of the heart and reins, and is desired by all good men; and
though God has no need to make use of any means to know the heart, and
what is in it; yet in order to know, or rather to make known, what is in
the hearts of his people, he proves them sometimes by adversity, as he
did Abraham and Job, and sometimes by prosperity, by mercies given forth
in a wonderful way, as to the Israelites in the wilderness, [Deu
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md); sometimes by suffering false
prophets and false teachers to be among them, [Deu
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#003.md); and sometimes by leaving
corruptions in them, and them to their corruptions, as he left the
Canaanites in the land, and as he left Hezekiah to his own heart, [Jdg
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#022.md). In one or other or more of these
ways God proved the heart of David, and found him to be a man after his
own heart; and in the first of these ways he proved Christ, who was
found faithful to him that appointed him, and was a man approved of God;

thou hast visited me in the night; God visited and redeemed his people
in the night of Jewish darkness; he visits and calls them by his grace
in the night of unregeneracy; and so he visits with his gracious
presence in the night of desertion; and he often visits by granting
counsel, comfort, and support, in the night of affliction, which seems
to be intended here; thus he visited the human nature of Christ in the
midst of his sorrows and sufferings, when it was the Jews' hour and
power of darkness. Elsewhere God is said to visit every morning, [Job
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#018.md);

thou hast tried me; as silver and gold are tried in the furnace; thus
the people of God, and their graces in them, are tried by afflictions;
so David was tried, and in this manner Christ himself was tried;
wherefore he is called the tried stone, [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md);

and shalt find nothing; or "shalt not find": which is variously
supplied; some "thy desire", or what is well pleasing to thee, so
Jarchi; or "thou hast not found me innocent", as Kimchi; others supply
it quite the reverse, "and iniquity is not found in me", as the
Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions; or "thou hast not
found iniquity in me", as the Syriac and Arabic versions; to which
agrees the Chaldee paraphrase, "and thou hast not found corruption";
which must be understood, not as if there was no sin and corruption in
David; for he often makes loud complaints and large confessions of his
sins, and earnestly prays for the forgiveness of them; but either that
there was no sin in his heart which he regarded, [Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md); which he nourished and
cherished, which he indulged and lived in; or rather there was no such
crime found in him, which his enemies charged him with; see [Psa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003.md). This is true of Christ in the
fullest sense; no iniquity was ever found in him by God, by men or
devils, [Joh 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md), [Pe1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022.md); and also of his people, as
considered in him, being justified by his righteousness, and washed in
his blood, [Jer 50:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#020.md); though
otherwise, as considered in themselves, they themselves find sin and
corruption abounding in them, [Rom
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018.md);

I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress; by murmuring against
God, on account of his visitation and fiery trials, or by railing at men
for their false charges and accusations; this resolution was taken up by
the psalmist in the strength of divine grace, and was kept by him, [Psa
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009.md); so Christ submitted himself
patiently to the will of God without repining, and when reviled by men
reviled not again, [Luk 22:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#042.md); and
from hence may be learned, that the laws of God may be transgressed by
words as well as by works, and that the one as well as the other should
be guarded against; see [Psa 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 17:4</span></span>

Concerning the works of men,.... Of wicked men, as to what respects and
concerns them, or in the midst of them; in the midst of a wicked
generation of men, and their filthy conversation; who appear to be so,

by the word of thy lips; the law of God, the Scriptures of truth, the
rule and standard of faith and practice, which show what works are good
and what are not; by the use, help, and benefit of this;

I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer; such is the devil, who
was a murderer from the beginning; antichrist, whose name is Abaddon and
Apollyon, both which signify a destroyer; false teachers, and all wicked
men: the "paths" of such are their wicked principles and practices,
their damnable errors and heresies, their sins and lusts, which make up
the broad road that leads to destruction: these the psalmist "kept" or
"observed" (a), for the words "me" and "from" are not in the original
text; and the sense is, that he took notice of them, and avoided them,
and, as a faithful prince and magistrate, forbad his subjects walking in
them, and restrained them from them, making the word of God the rule of
his conduct.

\(a\) "custodivi", Pagninus, Montanus; "observavi", Musculus, Piscator,
Cocceius, Gejerus; so Ainsworth; "vel prohibui", Muis.

[Psalms 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 17:5</span></span>

Hold up my goings in thy paths,.... Which being spoken by David in his
own person, and for himself, shows that he was conscious of his own
weakness to keep himself in the ways of God, and to direct his steps
therein; and that he was sensible of, the need he stood in of divine
power to uphold and support him in them;

that my footsteps slip not; out of the paths of truth and duty, of faith
and holiness; of which there is danger, should a man be left to himself,
and destitute of divine direction and aid; see [Psa
73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002.md); and though Christ had no moral
weakness in him, and was in no danger of falling into sin, or slipping
out of the ways of God; yet these words may be applied to him in a good
sense, as considered in human nature, and attended with the sinless
infirmities of it, he being God's servant, whom he upheld, and of whom
he gave his angels charge to keep him in all his ways, [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 17:6</span></span>

I have called upon thee,.... In prayer. This had been the constant
practice of the psalmist, and he still continued in it;

for thou wilt hear me, O God; God is a God hearing prayer; he is used to
hear his people, and they have frequent experience of it, and they may
be assured that whatsoever they ask according to his will, and in the
name of Christ, he will hear; and such an assurance is a reason engaging
the saints to a constant calling upon God, [Psa
116:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#002.md); and such confidence of being
always heard Christ had, [Joh 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#041.md);

incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech; meaning his prayer, which
he now directed to him in full assurance of being heard, and is as
follows.

[Psalms 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 17:7</span></span>

Show thy marvellous loving kindness,.... Such is the lovingkindness of
God to his people in Christ; which is sovereign, free, special,
distinguishing, everlasting, and unchangeable; it is better than life,
and passes knowledge; and which is set upon men and not angels, some and
not all, and these many of them the worst and vilest of men, and all of
them by nature children of wrath as others; and which has appeared in
choosing them in Christ, putting them into his hand, and making a
covenant with him for them; in sending him into the world to suffer and
die for them; in regenerating, adopting, justifying, pardoning, and
saving them with an everlasting salvation; all which is marvellous in
their eyes, and will be the wonder of men and angels to all eternity:
this sometimes is hidden from the objects of it, as it might be from the
psalmist, and therefore he desires a manifestation of it to him; or else
his sense is, that God would show to others in what a marvellous manner
he loved him, by the help, deliverance, and salvation he would give him.
Such a petition will agree with Christ; see [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010). Some render the words (b.md),
"separate thy lovingkindness", or cause it to pass "from them that rise
up on" or "against thy right hand"; but these were never the objects of
it; and there is no separation of them from it, nor of that from them
who are interested in it, [Rom 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md);
much better may it be rendered, "separate" or "distinguish thy
lovingkindness" (c); that is, let it appear that I have special interest
in thy lovingkindness, distinct from others; distinguish me by thy
lovingkindness, remember me with that which thou bearest to a peculiar
people, [Psa 106:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004.md);

O thou that savest by thy right hand; either by his power, or by the man
of his right hand, his own son;

them which put their trust in thee; not in men, not in an arm of flesh,
not in themselves, in their own power, wisdom, riches, and
righteousness; but in the Lord their God, who is the Saviour of all men,
but especially of them that believe, [Ti1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010.md); for these he saves both in a
temporal and in a spiritual manner;

from those that rise up against them; from all their spiritual enemies,
sin and Satan; and from all outward ones, from the men of the world,
oppressors and violent persecutors, who are afterwards described: the
phrase, "by thy right hand", is by some, as Aben Ezra, connected with
the word trust, and rendered, "them which trust in thy right hand" (d);
either in the grace, mercy, and favour of God, dispensed by his right
hand; or in his strength, and the mighty power of his arm; and by others
it is joined to the last clause, and so it stands in the original text,
and rendered, "from those that rise up against thy right hand" (e); and
so the words describe such persons who in a bold and presumptuous manner
set themselves against God, and strengthen themselves against the
Almighty; who resist his counsel and will, oppose themselves to the Lord
and his Anointed, the man of his right hand, made strong for himself;
and to his saints, who are as dear to him as his right hand, and who are
preserved by him in the hollow of his hand.

\(b\) Kimchi & Ben Melech. (c) "separa", Junius & Tremellius; "segrega",
Montanus; so some in Vatablus; see Ainsworth. (d) "eos qui fidunt in
dextera tua", so some in Vatablus, Castalio, Ainsworth; "recipentes se
ad dexteram suam", Junius & Tremellius. (e) "ob insurgentes in dexteram

[Psalms 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 17:8</span></span>

Keep me as the apple of the eye,.... Which is weak and tender, and is
hurt and put to pain, and made uneasy by every little thing that annoys
it, and than which nothing is more dear to a man, or he is more careful
of preserving from being hurt; and fitly represents the weak estate and
condition of God's people, his affection for them, and tender care of
them; who as he has provided tunics for the eye, and guarded it with
eyebrows, so he has taken care for the safety of his dear children, [Deu
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md);

hide me under the shadow of thy wings; alluding either to the wings of
the cherubim over the mercy seat, where God granted his presence; so the
Targum paraphrases it,

"under the shadow of thy Shechinah hide me;''

or to birds, who cover their young ones with their wings to save them
from birds of prey; see [Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md).
From such passages perhaps the Heathens had their notion of presenting
their gods with wings (f).

[Psalms 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 17:9</span></span>

From the wicked that oppress me,.... Or "waste" or "destroy" (g); as
wild beasts do a field or vineyard when they get into it; and such havoc
do persecutors and false teachers make of the church and people of God,
when they are suffered to get in among them, [Psa
80:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#013.md); wherefore from such wicked and
unreasonable men protection is desired, [Th2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002.md);

from my deadly enemies; enemies against his soul or life, who sought to
take it away, nothing would satisfy them but this;

who compass me about; on all sides, in order to obtain their desire;
such were the enemies of Christ, and so they are described, [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md).

\(g\) "quid vastant", Vatablus, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator; "qui
vastaverunt", Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius, Michaelis.

[Psalms 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 17:10</span></span>

They are enclosed in their own fat,.... Or "their fat has enclosed
them"; either their eyes, that they can hardly see out of them, or their
hearts, so that they are stupid and senseless, and devoid of the fear of
God; the phrase is expressive of the multitude of their wealth and
increase of power, by which they were swelled with pride and vanity, and
neither feared God nor regarded man; so the Targum paraphrases it,

"their riches are multiplied, their fat covers them;''

see [Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md); some read it, "their
fat shuts their mouths", so Aben Ezra and Kimchi; or "with their fat
they shut them" (h); but the accent "athnach" will not admit of this
reading; the last word belongs to the next clause;

with their mouth they speak proudly; against God and his people,
belching out blasphemies against the one, and severe menaces and
threatenings against the other.

\(h\) So De Dieu.

[Psalms 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 17:11</span></span>

They have now compassed us in our steps,.... The sense is, they could
not stir a step but they were at their heels, surrounding them on every
side. This was true of David, when he was pursued by Saul, and followed
by him to Keilah and the wilderness of Maon, [Sa1
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#008.md); according to the "Cetib", or
textual writing, it should be rendered, "they have compassed me"; but,
according to the "Keri", or marginal reading, and the points, it is as
we have translated it, and which is followed by the Targum, and both are
right, and design David as a principal person, and those that were with
him, who were encompassed by Saul and his men. This also was verified in
Christ, when Judas followed him into the garden with a band of men to
betray him, and when he was enclosed by wicked men as he went to the
cross, and hung upon it, [Joh 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002.md);
and may likewise be accommodated to the case of all the saints, who are
troubled on every side, are beset with the corruptions of their hearts,
the temptations of Satan, and the reproaches and persecutions of the men
of the world, [Co2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md);

they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; which posture either
denotes fraudulence and hypocrisy, showing, by looking only upon the
ground, as if they were harmless and inoffensive, and had no ill
designs, and took no notice of anything; which, as it was true of
David's enemies, so of the Jews and of Judas with respect to Christ, and
of false teachers with respect to the church, [Luk
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md), [Mat
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015.md); or else inhumanity and contempt,
not caring to turn their eyes to look upon them in distress, but kept
their eyes fixed upon the earth, so Christ was treated by the Jews, [Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003.md); or rather their being intent
upon mischief, their diligence and watchfulness to observe all motions,
and take every opportunity "to strike", or "cast me down to the earth",
as the Arabic and Syriac versions render it; or the sense is, as Kimchi
gives it, their eyes are upon our ways, to spread nets for us in the
earth to take us.

[Psalms 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 17:12</span></span>

Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey,.... Or "the likeness of him
is as a lion" (i); meaning Saul, as Kimchi interprets it; or everyone of
them that compassed them about, as Aben Ezra observes; sometimes wicked
and persecuting princes are compared to lions, for their strength and
cruelty; see [Pro 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015.md); so the devil
is called a roaring lion, [Pe1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md);
and the antichristian beast is said to have the mouth of a lion, [Rev
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002.md);

and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places; to leap upon its
prey, and seize it at once, as it has opportunity; this denotes the
secret and insidious method which the enemies of Christ take to do
mischief; see [Psa 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#009.md).

\(i\) "similitudo ejus, vel cujusque est tanquam leonis", Pagninus,

[Psalms 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 17:13</span></span>

Arise, O Lord,.... See [Psa 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md);

disappoint him, or "prevent his face" (k); be beforehand with him, and
so disappoint him, when he is about to seize his prey; who is comparable
to the lion, or to the young lion; meaning the chief of his enemies, it
may be Saul;

cast him down; everyone of them that set themselves to cast down others
to the earth. Jarchi's note is,

"cut off his feet,''

that he may bow down and fall;

deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword; so Jarchi, Aben
Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, render the words; that is, from wicked
men, whom God makes use of as instruments to afflict and chastise his
people: so the Assyrian monarch is called the "rod" of his anger, with
whom he scourged his people Israel, [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md). Compare with this [Psa
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020.md). The words are rendered by some,
"deliver my soul from the wicked by thy swords" (l); meaning not the
sword of the Spirit, the Word of God by which Christ was delivered from
the wicked one, when tempted by him in the wilderness; but the avenging
justice of God, the sword of the Lord, which, being whetted and taken
hold on, and used by him, brings vengeance on his enemies, and salvation
to his people; see [Deu 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041.md). The
Targum paraphrases the clause thus,

"deliver my soul from the wicked, who deserves to be slain by thy
sword.''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 17:14</span></span>

From men which are thy hand, O Lord,.... Some understand these words,
with what follows, as independent of the former, and of another set of
men, even of good men; so the Targum,

"and the righteous who deliver their souls for thy sake, O Lord, unto
death in the earth, their portion is in eternal life;''

so Jarchi gives the like sense of them: but the words are to be
connected with the preceding, as they are by Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben
Melech; and the sense is, deliver my soul from men, which are
instruments in thine hand to chastise thy people: so even Satan himself,
and the Sabeans and Chaldeans, whom he instigated to afflict Job, are
called the "hand" of the Lord that touched him, because he suffered them
to do what they did for the trial of him, [Job
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#021.md). The words may be rendered, "the
men of thy hand" (m); who are raised up by thine hand to the power and
dignity they have; and who can easily be pulled down by it; and who are
in thine hand, and at thy beck and control, and whose wrath and fury
thou canst restrain. Or they may be rendered, "from men by thy hand"
(n); that is, deliver me from them by thy strong hand and mighty power;
as Israel of old was delivered from the Egyptians by the strong and
mighty hand of God;

from men of the world: who are, as they were when they came into the
world, in sin, in darkness, and in a carnal and unregenerate state; who
are not only in the world, but of it, and belong to it, and to it only;
and are under the influence of the god of the world, and are taken with
the lusts and pleasures of it, and live in them and serve them: and are
of worldly spirits, inordinately love the things of the world, mind
earth and earthly things, and are unconcerned about the things of
another world; see [Luk 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008.md);

which have their portion in this life; and in this only; have a large
share of the good things of this life; and which is all their portion,
[Luk 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025.md);

and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: earthly treasure, as
gold and silver, which is called hid treasure, because it is first hid
in the bowels of the earth, out of which it is dug, and afterwards hid
in the coffers of worldly men; and oftentimes kept to the hurt of the
owners of it. Or the phrase may denote the value and preciousness of it.
And to have the belly filled with this is to have a very great affluence
and plenty of it; though it is very rare, let it be ever so large, that
men are fully satisfied with it;

they are full of children; which among the eastern nations was reckoned
a considerable part of outward prosperity and happiness; see [Job
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007.md); or their "children are full", or
"filled" (o) with hidden treasure also;

and leave the rest of their substance to their babes; their children's
children; their grandchildren, as Kimchi explains it; and which is said,
not by way of complaint, as an evil in them, since it is lawful and
right for parents to lay up for their children, and leave it to them:
unless the sense is, that they engross all to themselves, and to their
posterity, in life and death; while they live, they indulge their
sensual appetites and lusts, and fill themselves and theirs, but give
nothing to the poor and hungry; nor part with anything for the interest
of God and true religion; and when they die leave nothing for such use
and service, but all to their posterity: but rather the phrase is
expressive of their great plenty; that having lived in and enjoyed great
fulness themselves, and given large portions to their children, yet have
much left; which, at death, they bequeath to the young generation. Now
from such men in power and dignity, and from being hurt by them, as well
as from communion and conversation with them, the psalmist desires to be
delivered; and expresses his satisfaction in other and better things
than they enjoy, in the following words.

[Psalms 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 17:15</span></span>

As for me,.... I do not desire to be in their place and stead, with all
their plenty and prosperity; I am content with my present condition and
situation: for

I will, or "shall"

behold thy face in righteousness; that is, appear before God in public
worship, where was the ark, the symbol of the face of God; enjoy his
gracious presence, have the discoveries of his love, and see his face
and favour; than which nothing was more desirable by him and delightful
to him. Or God himself may be meant by "his face"; and especially God as
he is to be beheld in the face of Christ, the Angel of his presence; and
who is to be beheld by faith in the present state of things, though as
through a glass, darkly; and in the future state perfectly, and as he
is, both with the eyes of the understanding, and, after the
resurrection, with the eyes of the body; see [Job
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#026.md); and to this state the psalmist
seems more especially to have respect, as Jarchi interprets it: and the
beatific vision of God in Christ will be very glorious and exceeding
delightful; it will be assimilating and appropriating; it will be free
from all darkness and interruption, and will continue for ever. And this
shall be seen "in righteousness"; the psalmist believing that he should
then appear as an innocent person clear of all the false charges brought
against him; and so this may be understood of the righteousness of his
cause, in which he should stand before God, and enjoy communion with
him:, or this may design that perfect holiness and purity of heart,
without which no man shall see the Lord; and which, though now
imperfect, shall in the other state be without spot or blemish: or
rather, the righteousness of Christ, which fits believers for, and in
which they are brought into and stand in, the King's presence;

I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness; which will be in
the resurrection morn: or, as Jarchi expresses it, when the dead shall
awake from their sleep; for this is not to be understood of awaking from
natural sleep in the morning; when it is a satisfaction to a believer to
be with God, and to have God with him, [Psa
139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018.md); nor of awaking from a sleepy
drowsy frame of spirit, which sometimes attends the saints; but of
rising from the dead: for as death is oftentimes expressed by sleep in
Scripture, so the resurrection by an awaking out of it, [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md); at which time the saints will
arise with the image of the heavenly One upon them: they will be like to
Christ both in soul and body; in soul, in perfect knowledge and complete
holiness: in body, in incorruption and immortality, in power, glory, and
spirituality; in this will lie their happiness and satisfaction. Or the
meaning is, that he should be satisfied with the likeness of God, with
Christ the image of God, when he should arise from the dead; seeing he
should then appear with him in glory, see him as he is, and be like him,
and be for ever in his presence; which will yield endless pleasure and
unspeakable satisfaction. For the words may be interpreted, not of
David's awaking, but of the glory of God awaking or appearing; which
would afford an infinitely greater satisfaction than worldly men have in
worldly things (p), to which this is opposed, [Psa
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md); so the Septuagint and Vulgate
Latin versions read, I shall be satisfied when thy glory appears, or is
seen; and so the Ethiopic and Arabic versions.
