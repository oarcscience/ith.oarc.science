### [Amos Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO AMOS 8

In this chapter a fourth vision is delivered, the vision of a "basket of
summer fruit"; signifying the destruction of the ten tribes, for which
they were ripe, and which would quickly come upon them, [Amo
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md); the rich are reproved for their
oppression of the poor, their covetousness and earthly mindedness, [Amo
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004.md); for which they are threatened
with entire ruin, sudden calamities, and very mournful times, instead of
light, joy, and gladness, [Amo 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007.md);
and particularly with a famine of hearing the word of God, [Amo
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011.md); the consequence of which would
be, a fainting of the young men and virgins for thirst, and the utter
and irrecoverable ruin of all idolaters, [Amo
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#013.md).

[Amos 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 8:1</span></span>

Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me,.... Another vision, which is the
fourth, and after the following manner:

and, behold, a basket of summer fruit; not of the first ripe fruit, but
of such as were gathered at the close of the summer, when autumn began.
So the Targum,

"the last of the summer fruit;''

such as were fully ripe, and would not keep till winter; or, if kept,
would rot; but must be eaten directly, as some sort of apples, grapes,
&c. denoting the people of Israel being ripe for destruction, and would
be quickly devoured by their enemies; and that, as they had had a summer
of prosperity, they would now have a sharp winter of adversity.

[Amos 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 8:2</span></span>

And he said, Amos, what seest thou?.... To quicken his attention, who
might disregard it as a common thing; and in order to lead him into the
design of it, and show him what it was an emblem of:

and I said, a basket of summer fruit; some render it "a hook" (w), such
as they pull down branches with to gather the fruit; and the word so
signifies in the Arabic language (x); but the other is the more received
sense of the word:

then said the Lord unto me; by way of explanation of the vision: the end
is come upon my people Israel: the end of the kingdom of Israel; of
their commonwealth and church state; of all their outward happiness and
glory; their "summer was ended", and they "not saved", [Jer
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#020.md); all their prosperity was over;
and, as the Targum, their

"final punishment was come,''

the last destruction threatened them (y):

I will not again pass by them any more; pass by their offences, and
forgive their sins; or pass by their persons, without taking notice of
them, so as to afflict and punish them for their iniquities: or, "pass
through them and more" (z) now making an utter end of them; See Gill on
[Amo 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#008.md).

\(w\) "unicuus", V. L. (x) "ferramentum incurvum, seu uncus ex quo de
sella commeatum suspendit viator", Giggeius apud Golium, col. 2055. (y)
There is an elegant play on words in the words "summer", and "the end".
(z) So Mercerus, Grotius.

[Amos 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 8:3</span></span>

And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day,

saith the Lord God,.... Not the songs sung by the Levites in the temple
of Jerusalem, this prophecy respects the ten tribes only; but those in
imitation of them, sung in the temple at Bethel, and other idol temples;
or profane songs in the palaces of princes and nobles; that is, instead
of these, there should be howlings for the calamities come upon them. So
the Targum,

"they shall howl, instead of a song, in their houses then;''

particularly because of the slain in them, as follows; see [Amo
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023.md);

there shall be many dead bodies in every place; in all houses and
palaces, in all towns and cities; and especially in Samaria, during the
siege, and when taken, partly through the famine, and partly through the
sword:

they shall cast them forth with silence; they that have the care of
burying the dead bodies shall either cast them out of the houses upon
the bier or cart in which they are carried to the grave, or into the pit
or grave without any funeral lamentation: or, "they shall cast them
forth", and say, "be silent"; that is, as Kimchi explains it,

"one of them that casts them forth shall say to his companion, be
silent;''

say not one word against God and his providence, since this is
righteously come upon us; or say nothing of the number of the dead, lest
the hearts of those that hear should become tender, and be discouraged,
as Aben Ezra; or the enemy should be encouraged to go on with the siege.

[Amos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 8:4</span></span>

Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy,.... Like a man that pants
after a draught of water when thirsty; and, when he has got it, greedily
swallows it down at one gulp; so these rich men swallowed up the poor,
their labours, gains, and profits, and persons too; got all into their
own hands, and made them bondsmen and slaves to them; see [Amo
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007.md); these are called upon to hear
this dreadful calamity threatened, and to consider what then would
become of them and their ill gotten riches; and suggesting, that their
oppression of the needy was one cause of this destruction of the land:

even to make the poor of the land to fail; or "cease" (a); to die for
want of the necessaries of life, being obliged to such hard labour; so
unmercifully used, their faces ground, and pinched with necessity; and
so sadly paid for their work, that they could not live by it.

Drusius.

[Amos 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 8:5</span></span>

Saying, when will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn?.... The
first day of every month, on which it was forbid to sell any thing, or
do any worldly business, being appointed and used for religious service;
see [Kg2 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023.md); and which these carnal
earthly minded men were weary of, and wanted to have over, that they
might be selling their grain, and getting money, which they preferred to
the worship of God. Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it of the month of
harvest, when the poor found what to eat in the fields; when they
gleaned there, and got a sufficiency of bread, and so had no need to buy
corn; and hence these rich misers, that hoarded up the grain, are
represented as wishing the harvest month over, that they might sell
their grain to the poor, having had, during that month, no demand for
it; and so the Targum renders it the month of grain: or the month of
intercalation, as Jarchi understands it; every three years a month was
intercalated, to bring their feasts right to the season of the year; and
that year was a month longer than the rest, and made provision dearer;
and then the sense is, when will the year of intercalation come, that we
may have a better price for our grain? but the first sense seems best;

and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat; in the shops or markets,
for sale: or "open wheat" (b); the granaries and treasures of it, to be
seen and sold. Now the sabbath, or seventh day of the week, as no
servile work was to be done on it, so no trade or commerce was to be
carried on on that day; which made it a long and wearisome one to
worldly men, who wished it over, that they might be about their worldly
business. Kimchi and Ben Melech, by "sabbath", understand a "week",
which these men put off the poor unto, when the price of grain would
rise; and so from week to week refused to sell, and longed till the week
came when it would be dearer. The Targum and Jarchi interpret it of the
seventh year Sabbath, when there was no ploughing, nor sowing, nor
reaping, and so no selling of grain, but the people lived upon what the
earth brought forth of itself. But the first sense here is also best;

making the ephah small; a dry measure, that held three scabs, or about a
bushel of ours, with which they measured their grain and their wheat; so
that, besides the exorbitant price they required, they did not give due
measure:

and the shekel great; that is, the weight, or shekel stone, with which
they weighed the money the poor gave for their grain and wheat; this was
made heavier than it should be, and so of course the money weighed
against it was too light, and the poor were obliged to make it up with
more; and thus they cheated them, both in their measure, and in their
money:

and falsifying the balances by deceit? contrary to the law in [Deu
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013.md).

[Amos 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 8:6</span></span>

That we may buy the poor for silver,.... Thus making them pay dear for
their provisions, and using them in this fraudulent manner, by which
they would not be able to support themselves and their families; they
might purchase them and theirs for slaves, at so small a price as a
piece of silver, or a single shekel, worth about half a crown; and this
was their end and design in using them after this manner; see [Lev
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md);

and the needy for a pair of shoes; See Gill on [Amo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006.md);

yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat; not only did they sell the poor
grain and wheat at a dear rate, and in scanty measure, but the worst of
it, and such as was not fit to make bread of, only to be given to the
cattle; and, by reducing the poor to extreme poverty, they obliged them
to take that of them at their own price. It may be rendered, "the fall
of wheat" (c); that which fell under the sieve, when the wheat was
sifted, as Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, observe.

[Amos 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 8:7</span></span>

The Lord hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob,.... Not by the ark, as
R. Japhet; nor by the temple, as Kimchi; but by himself; which sense
Kimchi also mentions, and Aben Ezra; the God of Jacob and his glory, the
most excellent of all Jacob's enjoyments, and of whom he had reason to
boast and glory; see [Amo 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008.md);

surely I will never forget any of their works; their wicked works,
especially those now mentioned; God forgets when he forgives them, or
suffers them to go unpunished; but though he had done so long, he would
do so no more; on which they might depend, since he had not only said
it, but swore to it.

[Amos 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 8:8</span></span>

Shall not the land tremble for this,.... For this wickedness committed,
in using the poor with so much inhumanity? may not an earthquake be
expected? and which happened two years after Amos began to prophesy,
[Amo 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); or that the earth should
gape and swallow up these men alive, guilty of such enormities? or shall
not the inhabitants of the land tremble at such judgments, which the
Lord hath sworn he will bring upon it?

and everyone mourn that dwelleth therein? at the hearing of them, and
especially when they shall come upon them: as the calamity would be
general, the mourning should be universal:

and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; that is, the calamity threatened
shall rise up at once like a flood of waters, like Noah's flood, and
cover the whole land, and wash off and utterly destroy man and beast:

and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt; or the
river of Egypt, the Nile, which overflows at certain times, and casts up
its waters and its mud, and drowns all the country; so that the whole
country, during its continuance, looks like a sea: it overflows both its
banks, both towards Lybia or Africa, and towards Arabia, and on each
side about two days' journey, as Herodotus (d) relates; and this it does
regularly every year, in the summer solstice, in the higher and middle
Egypt, where it seldom rains, and its flood is necessary; but is not so
large in the lower Egypt, where it more frequently rains, and the
country needs it not. Strabo (e) says this flood remains more than forty
days, and then it decreases by little and little, as it increased; and
within sixty days the fields are seen and dried up; and the sooner that
is, the sooner they plough and sow, and have the better harvests.
Herodotus (f) says it continues a hundred days, and is near the same in
returning; and he says, unless it rises to sixteen, or at least fifteen
cubits, it will not overflow the country (g): and, according to Pliny
(h), the proper increase of the waters is sixteen cubits; if only they
arise to twelve, it is a famine; if to thirteen, it is hunger; if to
fourteen, it brings cheerfulness; if to fifteen, security; and if to
sixteen, delights. But Strabo (i) relates, that the fertility by it is
different at different times; before the times of Petronius, the
greatest fertility was when the Nile arose to the fourteenth cubit; and
when to the eighteenth, it was a famine: but when he was governor of
that country, when it only reached the twelfth cubit, there was great
fruitfulness; had when it came to the eighth (the eighteenth I suppose
it should be) no famine was perceived. An Arabic writer (k) gives an
account of the Nilometry, or measures of the Nile, from the year of
Christ 622 to 1497; and he says, that, when the depth of the channel of
the Nile is fourteen cubits, a harvest may be expected that will amount
to one year's provision; but, if it increases to sixteen, the corn will
be sufficient for two years; less than fourteen, a scarcity; and more
than eighteen makes a famine. Upon the whole, it seems that sixteen
cubits have been reckoned the standard that portends plenty, for many
generations, to which no addition has appeared to have been made during
the space of five hundred years.

"This we learn (says Dr. Shaw) (l), not only from the sixteen children
that attend the statue of the Nile, but from Pliny also; and likewise
from a medal of Hadrian in the great brass where we see the figure of
the Nile, with a boy upon it, pointing to the number sixteen. Yet in the
fourth century, which it will be difficult to account for, fifteen
cubits only are recorded by the Emperor Julian (m) as the height of the
Nile's inundation; whereas, in the middle of the sixth century, in the
time of Justinian, Procopius (n) informs us that the rise of the Nile
exceeded eighteen cubits; in the seventh century, after Egypt was
subdued by the Saracens, the amount was sixteen or seventeen cubits; and
at present, when the river rises to sixteen cubits, the Egyptians make
great rejoicings, and call out, "wafaa Allah", that is, "God has given
them all they wanted".''

The river begins to swell in May, yet no public notice is taken of it
till the twenty eighth or twenty ninth of June; by which time it is
usually risen to the height of six or eight pikes (or cubits, a Turkish
measure of twenty six inches); and then public criers proclaim it
through the capital, and other cities, and continue in the same manner
till it rises to sixteen pikes; then they cut down the dam of the great
canal. If the water increases to the height of twenty three or twenty
four pikes, it is judged most favourable; but, if it exceed that, it
does a great deal of mischief, not only by overflowing houses, and
drowning cattle, but also by engendering a great number of insects,
which destroy the fruits of the earth (o). And a late learned traveller
(p) tells us, that

"eighteen pikes is an indifferent Nile (for so high it is risen when
they declare it but sixteen); twenty is middling; twenty two is a good
Nile, beyond which it seldom rises; it is said, if it rises above twenty
four pikes, it is looked on as an inundation, and is of bad
consequence.''

And to such a flood the allusion is here. Thus the land of Israel should
be overwhelmed and plunged into the utmost distress, and sink into utter
ruin, by this judgment coming upon them; even the Assyrian army, like a
flood, spreading themselves over all the land, and destroying it. So the
Targum,

"a king shall come up against it with his army, large as the waters of a
river, and shall cover it wholly, and expel the inhabitants of it, and
shall plunge as the river of Egypt;''

see [Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 8:9</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God,.... When this
deluge and desolation of the land shall be, now spoken of:

that I will cause the sun to go down at noon: or to he so dark as if it
was set; as at the time of our Lord's crucifixion, to which many of the
ancient fathers refer this prophecy, though it has respect to other
times and things. Jarchi interprets it of the kingdom of the house of
David. It doubtless designs the kingdom of Israel, their whole policy,
civil and ecclesiastic, and the destruction of it; particularly their
king, princes, and nobles, that should be in great adversity, and that
suddenly and unexpectedly; it being a fine sunshine morning with them,
and they in great prosperity, and yet by noon their sun would be set,
and they in the utmost darkness and distress;

and I will darken the earth in a clear day; the land of Israel, the
people of it, the common people, who should have their share, in this
calamity and affliction; and though it had been a clear day with them,
and they promised themselves much and long felicity, yet on a sudden
their light would be turned into darkness, and their joy into sadness
and sorrow.

[Amos 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 8:10</span></span>

And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into
lamentation,.... Either their religious feasts, the feasts of pentecost,
tabernacles, and passover; at which three feasts there were eclipses of
the sun, a few years after this prophecy of Amos, as Bishop Usher (q)
observes: the first was an eclipse of the sun about ten digits, in the
year 3213 A.M. or 791 B.C., June twenty fourth, at the feast of
pentecost; the next was almost twelve digits, about eleven years after,
on November eighth, 780 B.C., at the feast of the tabernacles; and the
third was more than eleven digits in the following year, 779 B.C., on
May fifth, at the feast of the passover; which the prophecy may
literally refer to, and which might occasion great sorrow and concern,
and especially at what they might be thought to forebode: but
particularly this was fulfilled when these feasts could not be observed
any longer, nor the songs used at them sung any more; or else their
feasts, and songs at them, in their own houses, in which they indulged
themselves in mirth and jollity; but now, instead thereof, there would
be mourning and lamentation the loss of their friends, and being carried
captive into a strange land;

and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins; of high and low, rich and
poor; even those that used to be covered with silk and rich
embroideries: sackcloth was a coarse cloth put on in times of mourning
for the dead, or on account of public calamities:

and baldness upon every head: the hair being either shaved off or pulled
off; both which were sometimes done, as a token of mourning:

and I will make it as the mourning of an only son; as when parents mourn
for an only son, which is generally carried to the greatest height, and
continued longest, as well as is most sincere and passionate; the case
being exceeding cutting and afflictive, as this is hereby represented to
be:

and the end thereof as a bitter day; a day of bitter calamity, and of
bitter wailing and mourning, in the bitterness of their spirits; though
the beginning of the day was bright and clear, a fine sunshine, yet the
end of it dark and bitter, distressing and sorrowful, it being the end
of the people of Israel, as in [Amo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002.md).

[Amos 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 8:11</span></span>

Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God,.... Which Kimchi interprets
of all the days of the second house or temple after Malachi, when
prophecy ceased; but it rather has respect to the time of Shalmaneser's
carrying captive the ten tribes, when they had no more prophets nor
prophecy among them, or any to tell how long their captivity should
last, or when it would be better times with them, [Psa
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md);

that I will send a famine in the land; which, in a literal sense, is one
of God's arrows he has in his quiver, and sends out when he pleases; or
one of his sore judgments, which he sometimes orders to come upon a
people for their sins: but here is meant,

not a famine of bread; or through want of that, which is very dreadful;
as was the famine of Samaria, when an ass's head was sold for fourscore
pieces of silver, and a certain measure of dove's dung for five pieces
of silver, [Kg2 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025.md); and as were the
famines of Jerusalem, when taken both by the Chaldeans and Romans, when
delicate women boiled and ate their own children, [Lam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#008.md);

nor a thirst for water; which is more distressing and tormenting than
hunger; and to be slain with thirst is to be destroyed in the most
afflictive manner, [Hos 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003.md).
Lysimachus is said to part with his kingdom for a draught of water; and
the torments of hell are set forth by a violent thirst for it, [Luk
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#024.md); but something worse than either
of these is here threatened:

but of hearing the words of the Lord; the word of prophecy, and the
preaching of the word, or explaining the Scriptures. Of this blessing
the ten tribes were deprived at their captivity, and have been ever
since; and the Jews, upon their rejection of Christ, have had the
kingdom of God, the Gospel of the kingdom, the word and ordinances of
God, taken from them, and remain so to this day; the seven churches of
Asia have had their candlestick removed out of its place, and this
famine continues in those parts to this time; and, by the symptoms upon
us, we may justly fear it, will be our case before long. "The words of
the Lord" are the Scriptures, which cone from him, and are concerning
him; the doctrines of grace contained in them, the wholesome words of
Christ: hearing them signifies the preaching of them, [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md); by which hearing comes, and is a
great blessing, and should be attended to, as being the means of
conversion, regenerations, the knowledge of Christ, faith in him, and
the joy of it. Now, to be deprived of hearing the Gospel is a spiritual
famine, for that is food, bread, meat, milk, honey, yea, a feast; it is
food that is savoury, wholesome, nourishing, satisfying, strengthening,
and comforting; and when this is took away a famine ensues, as when a
church state is dissolved, ministers are ordered to preach no more in
such a place, or are scattered by persecution, or removed by death, and
none raised up in their stead; or when error prevails, to the
suppressing of truth: all which is done, or suffered to be done, for
indifference to the word of God, unfruitfulness under it, and contempt
of it, and, opposition to it; which is a dreadful case, when such a
famine is; for the glory, riches, and light of a nation, are gone; bread
for their souls is no more; and the means of conversion, knowledge,
comfort, &c. cease; and people in course must die, for lack of these
things; see [Isa 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md).

[Amos 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 8:12</span></span>

And they shall wander from sea to sea,.... From the sea of Tiberias, or
Galilee; or from the Dead sea, the lake Asphaltites; or from the Red
sea, which was to the south of the land of Israel, to the great sea,
which is to the west, as Aben Ezra: so the Targum,

"from the sea to the west;''

that is, to the Mediterranean sea:

and from the north even to the east; proceeding from the south to the
west, they shall turn from thence to the north, and so to the east,
which describes the borders of the land of Canaan, [Num
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003.md); and the sense is, that

they shall go to and fro; throughout the whole land, and all over it,

to seek the word of the Lord; not the written word, but the
interpretation of it; doctrine from before the Lord, as the Targum; the
preaching of the word, or ministers to instruct them in it; or the word
of prophecy, and prophets to tell them when it would be better times,
and how long their present distress should last:

and shall not find it; there should be no ministry, no preaching, no
prophesying; as never since among the ten tribes, so it has been the
case of the Jews, the two tribes, upon the rejection of the Messiah; the
Gospel was taken from them; no tidings could they hear of the Messiah,
though they ran to and fro to find him, it being told them Lo, here, and
Lo, there; see [Joh 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034.md).

[Amos 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 8:13</span></span>

In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. After
the word, for want of that grain and wine, which make young men and
maids cheerful, [Zac 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#017.md); but, being
destitute of them, should be covered with sorrow, overwhelmed with
grief, and ready to sink and die away. These, according to some, design
the congregation of Israel; who are like to beautiful virgins, as the
Targum paraphrases it; and the principal men of it, the masters of the
assemblies: or, as others, such who were trusting to their own
righteousness, and seeking after that which they could never attain
justification by, and did not hunger and thirst after the righteousness
of Christ, and so perished.

They that swear by the sin of Samaria,.... The calf at Bethel, which was
near Samaria, and which the Samaritans worshipped; and was set up by
their kings, and the worship of it encouraged by their example, and
which is called the calf of Samaria, [Hos
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005.md); the making of it was the effect
of sin, and the occasion of leading into it, and ought to have been had
in detestation and abhorrence, as sin should; and yet by this the
Israelites swore, as they had used to do by the living God; so setting
up this idol on an equality with him:

and say, thy God, O Dan, liveth; the other calf, which was set up in
Dan; and to this they gave the epithet of the bring God, which only
belonged to the God of Israel:

and the manner of Beersheba liveth; or, "the way of Beersheba" (r); the
long journey or pilgrimage of those at Beersheba; who chose to go to
Dan, rather than Bethel, to worship; imagining they showed greater
devotion and religion, by going from one extreme part of the land to the
other, for the sake of it. Dan was on the northern border of the land of
Judea, about four miles from Paneas, as you go to Tyre (s); and
Beersheba was on the southern border of the land, twenty miles from
Hebron (t); and the distance of these two places was about one hundred
and sixty miles (u). And by this religious peregrination men swore; or
rather by the God of Beersheba, as the Septuagint render it; though the
phrase may only intend the religion of Beersheba, the manner of worship
there, it being a place where idolatry was practised; see [Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md). The Targum is,

"the fear (that is, the deity) which is in Dan liveth, and firm are the
laws of Beersheba;''

even they shall fall, and never rise up again; that is, these idolatrous
persons, that swear by the idols in the above places, shall fall into
calamity, ruin, and destruction, by and for their sins, and never
recover out of it; which was fulfilled in the captivity of the ten
tribes, from whence they have never returned to this day.
