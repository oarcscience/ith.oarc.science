### [Numbers Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO NUMBERS 5

This chapter contains a repetition of some former laws, concerning
putting unclean persons out of the camp, [Num
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#001.md); making restitution in case of
trespass against another, [Num 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#005.md);
and of giving the offering of all holy things and all hallowed things to
the priests, [Num 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#009.md); and a new law
concerning jealousy, in a man, of his wife, [Num
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#011.md); when she was to be brought to
the priest, and various rites and ceremonies to be used, [Num
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#015.md); who was to give her bitter water
as a trial of her chastity, which, if guilty, would have a strange
effect upon her, and make her accursed, but if not, would not affect
her, and she would be free and happy, [Num
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#024.md).

[Numbers 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 5:1</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... Jarchi says, what follows was said on
the day the tabernacle was erected, but it seems rather to have been
delivered after the several camps were formed, and the people numbered,
when those that were unclean were ordered to be cast out of them:

saying; as follows.

[Numbers 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 5:2</span></span>

Command the children of Israel,.... Not as from himself, but from the
Lord; deliver out the following as a command of his, to which obedience
was required of all the children of Israel:

that they put out of the camp every leper; there were three camps,
Jarchi says, in the time of their encampment; between the curtains was
the camp of the Shechinah, or the divine Majesty; the encampment of the
Levites round about; and from thence to the end was the camp of the
standards, to the four winds, which was the camp of Israel; and the
leper was to be put out of them all; so Ben Gersom; see [Lev
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#046.md),

and everyone that hath an issue; a gonorrhoea, man or woman, see [Lev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002.md); according Jarchi, such an one
might be in the camp of Israel, but was to be put out of the other two
camps:

and whosoever is defiled by the dead; by attending the funerals of the
dead, or touching them, see [Lev 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001.md);
such an one might go into the camp of the Levites, according to Jarchi
and Ben Gersom; and was to be put of none but the camp of the Shechinah,
or the tabernacle; but the camp of Israel seems to be meant of them all,
out of which they were to be put, as an emblem of the rejection of all
impure persons out of the church of God.

[Numbers 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 5:3</span></span>

Both male and female shall ye put out,.... Whether leprous, or
profluvious, or defiled by touching a dead carcass: by this law, Miriam,
when leprous, was put out of the camp, [Num
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014.md),

without the camp shall ye put them; which is repeated that it might be
taken notice of, and punctually observed:

that they defile not their camps; of which there were four, the camps of
Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan:

in the midst whereof I dwell; for the tabernacle, which was the dwelling
place of the Lord, was in the midst of the camps of Israel; they were
pitched on the four quarters of it; and this is a reason why impure
persons were not suffered to be in the camp of Israel, because of the
presence of God in the tabernacle so near them, to whom all, impurity is
loathsome, and not to be permitted in his sight; and though this was
ceremonial, it was typical of the uncleanness of sin, which is
abominable to him, and renders persons unfit for communion with him, and
with his people.

[Numbers 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 5:4</span></span>

And the children of Israel did so, and put them without the camp,....
Aben Ezra observes, that this was done immediately before they
journeyed, and that those that were defiled journeyed between the
standard of Ephraim and the standard of Dan; but this, he says, was by
way of conjecture, since it is not expressed:

as the Lord spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel; they were
obedient in this particular.

[Numbers 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 5:5</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... Or continued to speak to him at the
same time:

saying; as follows.

[Numbers 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 5:6</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel,.... Put them in mind of the following
law, that they observe it; and which is here repeated, because of two
new things in it, as Jarchi observes, the one relates to confession,
teaching that there is no fifth part nor trespass offering by witnesses,
till a man confesses the thing; and the other is, concerning taking
anything away by violence from a proselyte, which is to be given to the
priests; see the original law in [Lev
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#001.md),

when a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit; or, "any of
the sins of men" (e), which are commonly done by men, and men are
subject to through the infirmity of the flesh, and the temptations of
Satan; or "any sin against man" (f), so some, as this referred to is
expressly said to be, [Num 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#007.md),

to do a trespass against the Lord; for every sin against man is also
against the Lord, being a breach of his command; as David's sin against
Uriah was a sin against the Lord, [Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md); though the Jews understand it
particularly of lying and swearing falsely, appealing to God, and
calling him to be a witness to a falsehood; and so the Targum of Onkelos
seems to interpret it:

and the person be guilty; and knows he is so, and even knew it when he
took an oath to the contrary; see [Lev
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#003.md).

\(e\) "ex omnibus peccatis hominis", Montanus. (f) "Ex omnibus peccatis
contra hominem", Tigurine version; so Patrick.

[Numbers 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 5:7</span></span>

Then they shall confess their sin which they have done,.... The form of
which confession, according to Fagius, was, O Lord, I am guilty of
death, I have deserved to be stoned for this sin, or to be strangled for
this trespass, or to be burnt for this crime, &c.

and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add
unto it the fifth part thereof; paying the whole of whatsoever he had in
any manner defrauded his neighbour of, to which he was to add a fifth
part of that; that is, as Aben Ezra interprets it, it he confesses of
himself, but if there are witnesses of it he must add two fifths, and
some say a fifth of a fifth:

and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed; as a satisfaction
for the injury done him.

[Numbers 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 5:8</span></span>

But if a man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass to,.... This
supposes that if a man should die, against whom the trespass is, before
the restitution is made, then it shall be made to his heirs; and if he
has none, then it was to be given to the priest, as after directed: the
Jews (g) generally understand this of a proselyte, that has no heirs,
for they say, there is no Israelite but has kinsmen, a brother or a son,
or some one or other near of kin to him, of his father's family, even up
to Jacob:

let the trespass be recompensed unto the Lord, even to the priest; that
is, let the principal, with the fifth part, which is the recompence for
the trespass committed, be given to the priest of the Lord, which is the
same as if it was given to him, he being his minister:

beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for
him; which, in this case, was ordered to be offered for the expiation,
of the trespass, see [Lev 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#006.md); the
Jewish canon is,"he that takes away anything by force from a proselyte,
and swears to him, and he (the proselyte) dies, lo, he shall pay the
principal and the fifth to the priests, and the trespass offering to the
altar, as it is said, "if a man has no kinsman", &c. when he brings the
money and the trespass offering, and he is dead, the money shall be
given to his sons, but the trespass offering (the ram) shall feed until
it contracts some blemish, and then it shall be sold, and the price of
it shall fall to the freewill offerings (h).''

\(g\) Maimon. & Bartenora in Misn. Bava Kama, c. 9. sect. 11. Jarchi in
loc. (h) Misn. Bava Kama, ib.

[Numbers 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 5:9</span></span>

And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel,....
Of the holy sacrifices brought by them to be offered up; that part of
them which is elevated, heaved, or waved, as the heave shoulder and wave
breast:

which they bring unto the priest, shall be his; what they bring to him
to offer for them shall be his who performs the service, even that part
of them which is his due.

[Numbers 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 5:10</span></span>

And every man's hallowed things shall be his,.... Which he, by a vow or
freewill offering, separates to holy uses; these are at his own dispose,
to give to what priest he will, or they are the priest's; for what a man
devotes to the Lord is to be given to them, or such things as God has
hallowed, sanctified, and set apart for sacred uses, as the firstfruits
and tithes, they were the priests'; the Jewish writers (i) restrain it
to tithes:

whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his; his personally,
who officiates, or to whom the gift is given, and is not to be divided
among the other priests in the course.

\(i\) Targ. Jon. Siphri & Midrash in Jarchi in loc.

[Numbers 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 5:11</span></span>

And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... At the same time, and delivered to
him a new law:

saying; as follows.

[Numbers 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 5:12</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,.... It being an
affair which concerned them:

if any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him; the sin
of adultery, which is a going aside out of the way of virtue and
chastity, and a trespass against an husband, a breach of the marriage
covenant with him, a defiling his bed, doing an injury and dishonour to
him, bringing confusion into his family, and a spurious offspring to
possess his substance: though this is to be understood, not of certain
adultery, of which there is plain and full proof, for then there would
be no occasion of such a trial, as is afterwards directed to; besides,
her husband, in such a case, might put her away, and even, according to
the law, she was to be put to death, [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md); but of her having committed it
in the opinion of her husband, he having some ground of suspicion,
though he could not be certain of it; and therefore, by this law, was
allowed to make trial, that he might find it out, it at present only a
suspected case, and a doubtful one; and the Jews (k) say,"they never
gave the waters drink but in a doubtful case:''and so this may
interpreted of her declining and departing from her husband's house, not
keeping at home to mind the affairs of her family, but gadding abroad,
and keeping company with another man, or other men; and that after she
had been warned and charged by her husband to the contrary, and so had
disobeyed him, and acted contrary to his will; and in that sense had
committed a trespass, and so had given him suspicion of her unchastity,
for which he might have some reason; if, as it is said in the Misnah
(l), he gave her an admonition before two witnesses, saying, have no
talk with such a man, and yet she talks with him; or, as the
commentators add (m), be not secretly or in private with such an one,
and yet goes into a private place with him, and stays so long with him
that she may be defiled; this with them rendered her suspected.

(m) Maimon. & Bartenora in Misn. Bava Kama, c. 9. sect. 11.

[Numbers 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 5:13</span></span>

And a man lie with her carnally,.... That is, is suspected that he has
so done, not that it is a clear case, for it follows:

and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close; so that
it is not known by her husband, nor by any other; "she hath hid
herself", so Ainsworth, being in a private place with another man,
though warned to the contrary by her husband:

and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her; of her being
defiled, though there may be of her being in private with such a man:

neither she be taken with the manner; or in the act of uncleanness.

[Numbers 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 5:14</span></span>

And the spirit of jealousy come upon him,.... A thought rises up in his
mind, a strong suspicion works in him, which he cannot resist and throw
off, but it remains with him, and makes him very uneasy, that his wife
has defiled his bed, as it follows:

and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled; that his wife is
defiled by a man; and which is the real case, as it afterwards appears,
though at present he is not certain, only has a suspicion of it:

or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his
wife, and she be not defiled; it is mere jealousy and suspicion, without
any foundation for it; and his wife proved a chaste and virtuous woman;
yet be it which it would, he being jealous, the following law was to
take place, and the following rules to be observed.

[Numbers 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 5:15</span></span>

Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest,.... Not to the high
priest but to a common priest, anyone then officiating in his course;
for there was a jealousy offering to be offered up before the Lord upon
the altar, which none but a priest might do; and besides, the whole
process in this affair was to be carried, on by him: according to the
Misnah (n), the man brought his wife first to the sanhedrim, or court of
judicature in the place where he lived; before whom, as Maimonides (o)
says, he proved by witnesses that he had warned his wife of being in
private with such a man, and yet she had done it again; and whereas she
insisted on her chastity, he desired that the bitter waters might be
given her, that the truth might appear; and then they sent him with two
disciples of the wise men, to the great sanhedrim at Jerusalem, where
the trial was made; who, in order to bring her too confession,
endeavoured to terrify her, as they do persons in capital cases, and
finding this wilt not do, then they used smooth words, saying, my
daughter, perhaps much wine was the occasion of it, or much laughter,
&c.

and he shall bring her offering for her: not the priest, but her
husband, and that whether he is willing or not, as Aben Ezra; who also
observes, that it may be interpreted, with her, or for her sake, not to
make any expiation for any fault of his, that when he first observed her
immodesty, did not reprove her; for the offering, though brought by him,
was not his, but his wife's, and not to expiate her sin, but to bring it
to remembrance, as is after expressed:

the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; which was an omer, [Exo
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#036.md), the quantity of manna for one
man every day, [Exo 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016.md), and the
quantity of flour in the daily meat offering, [Exo
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040.md); only that was of fine wheaten
flour; this of barley, the food of beasts, as the Targum of Jonathan
remarks; and R. Gamaliel in the Misnah (p) says, that as her deed was
the deed of a beast, so her offering was the food of a beast; and this
is observed by Jarchi and Aben Ezra on the text, as the reason of barley
being used in this offering: some say it was a symbol of her impudence,
others of her being little at home, as the barley is not long under
ground (q); the true reason, it may be, was for her humiliation, being
vile, and mean, hence it follows:

he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; as used to
be oft meat offerings, denoting their acceptableness to God, [Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md); the reason seems to be, because
these were tokens of joy and gladness, whereas this was a mournful
affair to the husband, that he should have any cause of suspicion and
jealousy, to the wife that she should be suspected, and to the whole
family on that account:

for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing
iniquity to remembrance; if guilty of it, and therefore oil and
frankincense were forbidden in this kind of offering as in a sin
offering, [Lev 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011.md).

[Numbers 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 5:16</span></span>

And the priest shall bring her near,.... Or "offer it", as the Vulgate
Latin version, that is, the offering of jealousy:

and set her before the Lord; or "it", the offering; for which the
Tigurine version is more express,"let the priest offer that sacrifice,
and set that before the Lord,''for the setting of the woman before the
Lord is spoken of in [Num 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#018.md).

[Numbers 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 5:17</span></span>

And the priest shall take holy water,.... Out of the laver, as the
Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, and so Jarchi and Aben Ezra:

in an earthen vessel; which held half a log, and that was but a quarter
of a pint, or three egg shells; for no more was assigned, to a suspected
woman, according to the Misnah (r). Some say only a fourth part: an
earthen vessel was made use of, as everything vile and mean was in this
affair:

and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall
take, and put it into the water; first the water was put in, and then
the dust, as Ben Gersom observes: there was a place a cubit square,
where was a marble table, and a ring fixed in it, and when he lifted it
up he took dust from under it, and put it so as it might be upon the top
of the water (s); which was used, either, as the Targum of Jonathan
suggests, because the end of all flesh is to come to dust, and so to put
her in mind of her original and her end; and in like manner the earthen
vessel might signify, that she would be broke to pieces as that vessel;
as also it might direct her thoughts to the tempter, by the influence of
whose temptation she had been drawn into this sin, dust being the
serpent's food; and this being taken off the floor of the tabernacle,
might add to the veneration of it, and make it more solemn and awful to
drink of it.

[Numbers 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 5:18</span></span>

And the priest shall set the woman before the Lord,.... In the east of
the tabernacle, with her face to the west, where was the holy of holies,
so Ben Gersom; but not immediately for they had her from place to place,
as Jarchi says, till she was weary, and her mind disturbed, that she
might confess; and if she said, I am defiled, she rent the writing of
her dowry, and went out; but if she said, I am pure, they brought her to
the eastern gate, the gate of Nicanor, for there they made women
suspected of adultery to drink the waters (t):

and uncover the woman's head; as a token of her immodesty and
non-subjection to her husband, and that she might be seen by all, to
cause shame in her: according to the Misnah (u), the priest took off her
clothes, and loosed her hair--if she was clothed with white garments, he
clothed her with black; if she had on her ornaments of gold, chains,
earrings, or rings, he took them away from her, that she might be
unseemly, and whoever would might come and look at her:

and put the offering of memorial into her hands, which is the jealousy
offering; to weary her, as Jarchi says, that if perhaps her mind was
disturbed she would confess; and so in the Misnah (w) it is said, that
her husband put this offering into her hands to weary her; but the true
reason here seems to be, that it might appear to be her own offering:

and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the
curse; not that the water was bitter of itself, for it was the water out
of the laver, and had nothing in it but the dust of the floor of the
tabernacle; though some think some bitter thing was put into it, so Ben
Gersom, as wormwood; but it is so called from the effects of it on those
that were guilty; it produced sad effects in them, bitter and
distressing, and made them appear to be accursed ones, for it was not
bitter till it entered, [Num 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#024.md);
whereas it was not so to the innocent, nor attended with any such
consequence to them; so that there was nothing in the water itself, but
its efficacy was divine and supernatural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 5:19</span></span>

And the priest shall charge her by an oath,.... Or give her her oath:

and say unto the woman, if no man hath lain with thee: besides her
husband:

and thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy
husband; which is but another phrase expressive of the same thing, the
sin of adultery:

be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse; if this is
the case, it shall produce no bitter effects, or bring any curse upon
thee.

[Numbers 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 5:20</span></span>

But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband,.... Gone
aside from the paths of modesty and chastity, and betook herself to
another man's bed instead of her husband's:

and if thou be defiled, by committing adultery:

and some man hath lain with thee beside thy husband; these phrases are
all synonymous, and a heap of words are made use of to express the sin,
and that there might be no evasion of it, and that it might be clear
what was intended, this being said on oath.

[Numbers 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 5:21</span></span>

Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing,.... An
oath which has a curse annexed to it, if taken falsely, which was to be
pronounced upon the woman if guilty:

and the priest shall say unto the woman; pronouncing the imprecation or
curse upon her, she having taken the oath, should she be guilty of the
crime suspected of, and she had swore concerning:

the Lord make thee a curse, and an oath among the people; accursed
according to the oath taken; or let this be the form of an oath and
imprecation used by the people, saying, if I have done so and so, let me
be accursed as such a woman, or let not that happen to me, as did to
such a woman, so Jarchi:

when the Lord doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell; upon
drinking the bitter waters; but though these things followed upon that,
yet not as the natural cause of them, for they are ascribed to the Lord,
and to a supernatural and miraculous power of his, which went along with
the drinking of them.

[Numbers 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 5:22</span></span>

And this water that causeth the curse,.... Upon the drinking of which
the curse follows, if guilty:

shall go into thy bowels; and there operate and produce the above
effects, which are repeated again to inject terror:

to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot; here ends the form of
the oath, which begins [Num 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#019.md),

and the woman shall say, amen, amen; so be it; let it be as pronounced,
if I am guilty; which, as Aben Ezra observes, is repeated for the sake
of confirmation; though the Jewish writers commonly understand it as
respecting various things, the oath and the curse, the thing charged
with, and the persons suspected of (x).

\(x\) Misn. ib. sect. 5. Targum Jon. & Jerus. & Jarchi in loc.

[Numbers 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 5:23</span></span>

And the priest shall write these curses in a book,.... The above curses
imprecated on herself by an oath; the words and the letters of them were
written at length, in a scroll of parchment; and, as some say also, her

and into it, or scrape them off of the parchment into it.

And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the
curse,..... Having the curse imprecated upon herself, if guilty, scraped
into it; and this she was obliged to drink, whether she would or not; so
it is said, if the roll is blotted out, and she says I am defiled, the
water is poured out, and her offering is scattered in the place of
ashes; if the roll is blotted out, and she says I will not drink, then
force her, and make her drink whether she will or no (z):

and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become
bitter; produce the sad and bitter effects mentioned.

Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's
hand,.... Which she was obliged to hold in her hand while the above
rites and ceremonies were performed; which was very heavy, being an omer
of barley flour, a measure about three quarts, which was put into an
Egyptian basket made of small palm tree twigs: and this was put into her
hands to weary her, as before observed, that, having her mind
distressed, she might the sooner confess her crime:

and shall wave the offering before the Lord: backwards and forwards,
upwards and downwards, as Jarchi; who also observes, that the woman
waved with him, for her hand was above the hand of the priest so the
tradition is,"he (her husband) took her offering out of the Egyptian
basket, and put it into a ministering vessel, and gave it into her hand,
and the priest put his hand under hers, and waved it (a):"

and offer it upon the altar: this was the bringing of it to the
southwest corner of the altar, as Jarchi says, before he took a handful
out of it, as in other meat offerings.

And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial
thereof,.... For good or evil, according as her works were, as Aben Ezra
observes; a memorial for good, if innocent, and a memorial for evil, if
guilty:

and burn it upon the altar; as the handful of other meat offerings used
to be, [Lev 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002.md),

and afterwards shall cause the woman to drink the water; oblige her to
it; having proceeded thus far, and no confession made, namely, an oath
taken, the curses of it written in a scroll and scraped into the waters,
and the jealousy offering waved and offered.

[Numbers 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 5:27</span></span>

And when he hath made her to drink the water,.... For, as before
observed, and here by Jarchi again, if she says I will not drink it,
after the roll is blotted out, they oblige her, and make her drink it
whether she will or not, unless she says I am defiled:

then it shall come to pass, that if she be defiled, and have done
trespass against her husband; or has committed adultery:

that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become
bitter; the water drank by her, and having the curses scraped into it,
shall enter into her, and operate and produce bitter and dreadful
effects:

and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot; not through any
natural virtue in the water, or what is put into it, either the dust of
the floor of the tabernacle, or the scrapings of the parchment roll,
these could have no physical influence to produce such effects; but they
must be ascribed to a supernatural cause, the power and curse of God
attending this draught. A certain Jewish writer (b) says, though very
falsely, that the priest put poison into the water, which produced such
effects; but then, how could an innocent woman escape the effects of it?
that must be allowed to be miraculous and supernatural, was it so; but
there is no manner of reason to believe that anything of this kind was
put into it, The Jews say (c), as soon, or before she had made an end of
drinking: the water, the effects appeared; her face turned pale
immediately, her eyes bolted out, and she was filled with veins, her
body swelled, and they called out, Cast her out, cast her out, that she
may not defile the court. And the text seems to intimate, as if the
operation was immediate; yea, moreover, they say (d), that as the waters
searched her, so they searched him (the adulterer), because it is said
twice, "shall enter, shall enter"; and that the same effects appeared in
him as in her, but in neither, unless the husband was innocent; for if
he was not pure from the same sin himself, the waters would not search
his wife (e) hence they say (f), when adulterers increased (under the
second temple) the bitter waters ceased, according to [Hos
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014.md); see [Mat
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039.md). This practice has been imitated
by the Heathens; the river Rhine, according to Julian the emperor (g),
tried the legitimacy of children; and so lakes have been used for the
trial of perjury and unchastity, as the Stygian lake for perjury, and
another of the same name near Ephesus for unchastity; into which, if
persons suspected of adultery descended, having the form of an oath
hanging about their necks, if they were pure, the waters stood unmoved,
but if corrupt, they swelled up to their necks, and covered the tablet
on which the oath was written (h). The priestesses of a certain deity
being obliged to live a single life, were tried by drinking bullocks'
blood, upon which, if false to their oath and corrupt, they immediately
died, as Pausanias (i) relates; and Macrobius (k) speaks of some lakes
in Sicily, the inhabitants called the Cups, to which recourse was had
when persons were suspected of any ill, and where an oath was taken of
them; if the person swore truly, he departed unhurt, but if falsely, he
immediately lost his life in the lake. Philostratus (l) relates of a
water near Tyana, a city in Cappadocia, sacred to Jupiter, which the
inhabitants call Asbamaea, which to those that kept their oaths was
placid and sweet, but to perjured persons the reverse; it affected their
eyes, hands, and feet, and seized them with dropsies and consumptions;
nor could they depart from the water, but remained by it, mourning their
sad case, and confessing their perjury: but what comes nearest to this
usage of the Jews is a custom at marriages among the savages at Cape
Breton (m): at a marriage feast, two dishes of meat are brought to the
bridegroom and bride in two "ouragans" (basins made of the bark of a
tree), and the president of the feast addresses himself to the bride
thus,"and thou that art upon the point of entering into a respectable
state, know, that the nourishment thou art going to take forebodes the
greatest calamities to thee, if thy heart is capable of harbouring any
ill design against thy husband, or against thy nation: shouldest thou
ever be led astray by the caresses of a stranger; or shouldest thou
betray thy husband, and thy country, the victuals contained in this
"ouragan" will have the effects of a slow poison, with which thou wilt
be tainted from this very instant; but if, on the other hand, thou
remainest faithful to thy husband, and to thy country, if thou wilt
never insult the one for his defect, nor give a description of the other
to the enemy, thou wilt find this nourishment both agreeable and
wholesome.''Now if these relations can be credited, then much more this
of the bitter waters, for though there was something wonderful and
supernatural in them, yet nothing incredible:

and the woman shall be a curse among her people: the time she lives; but
then all this while she was looked upon as an accursed person, and
despised and shunned by all.

And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean,.... If she is not guilty
of adultery, but pure from that sin:

then she shall be free; from the effects of the bitter water; they shall
have no such influence upon her, but she shall be as soured and
healthful as ever; nay, the Jewish writers say more so, that if she had
any sickness or disease upon her she would now be freed from it (n); the
Targum of Jonathan has it, her splendour shall shine, the brightness and
beauty of her countenance:

and shall conceive seed; a man child, as the same Targum; and the Jewish
writers say, if she was barren before, now she would be fruitful; but no
more is meant by it than that her husband should receive her gladly, and
she should live comfortably with him hereafter, and the blessing of God
would be upon her, which would still be a confirmation of her chastity.

[Numbers 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 5:29</span></span>

This is the law of jealousies,.... Which was appointed by God to deter
wives from adultery, and preserve the people of Israel, the worshippers
of him, from having a spurious brood among them; and to keep husbands
from being cruel to their wives they might be jealous of, and to protect
virtue and innocence, and to detect lewdness committed in the most
secret manner; whereby God gave proof of his omniscience, that he had
knowledge of the most private acts of uncleanness, and was the avenger
of all such. The reasons why such a law was not made equally in favour
of women, as of men, are supposed to be these: because of the greater
authority of the man over the woman, which would seem to be lessened, if
such a power was granted her; because marriage was not so much hurt, or
so much damage came to families by the adultery of men, as of women;
because women are more apt to be suspicious than men, and in those times
more prone to adultery, through their eager desire of children, that
they might not lie under reproach (o):

when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is
defiled; is suspected of going aside to another man, and is supposed to
be defiled by him.

Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over
his wife,.... See Gill on [Num 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#014.md),

and shall set the woman before the Lord; has carried the matter so far
as to bring his wife to the priest or civil magistrate, and declare his
suspicion, and the ground of it:

and the priest shall execute upon her all this law; he shall proceed
according to the law, and perform every rite and ceremony required; nor
could any stop be put to it, unless the woman owned she was defiled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 5:31</span></span>

Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity,.... Which otherwise he
would not, by conniving at her loose way of living, and not reproving
her for it, and bringing her either to repentance or punishment; and
retaining and encouraging jealousy in his mind, without declaring it,
and his reasons for it: the sense of the passage seems to be, that when
a man had any ground for his suspicion and jealousy, and he proceeded
according as this law directs, whether his wife was guilty or not
guilty, no sin was chargeable on him, or blame to be laid to him, or
punishment inflicted on him:

and the woman shall bear her iniquity; the punishment of it, through the
effects of the bitter waters upon her, if guilty; nor was her husband
chargeable with her death, she justly brought it on herself: or if not
guilty, yet as she had by some unbecoming behaviour raised such a
suspicion in him, nor would she be reclaimed, though warned to the
contrary, she for it justly bore the infamy of such a process; which was
such, as Maimonides says (p), that innocent women would give all that
they had to escape it, and reckoned death itself more agreeable than
that, as to be served as such a woman was; See Gill on [Num
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#018.md).
