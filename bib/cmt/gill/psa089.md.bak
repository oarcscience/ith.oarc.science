[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 89

Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. Who this Ethan was is not certain. Kimchi
takes him to be the same with Ethan the wise man, a grandson of Judah,
[Kg1 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md). But seeing he lived some
hundreds of years before the times of David, it is not likely that he
should be the writer of this psalm; for David is made mention of in it,
which could not be, unless it can be thought to be by a spirit of
prophecy; which indeed is the opinion of Doctor Lightfoot (k), who takes
this Ethan to be the penman of this psalm; and who

"from the promise, [Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md) sings
joyfully the deliverance (of Israel); that the raging of the Red sea
should be ruled, [Psa 89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009.md), and Rahab,
or Egypt, should be broken in pieces, [Psa
89:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#010.md), and that the people should hear
the joyful sound of the law, [Psa
89:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015.md), and as for the name of David in
it, this, he says, might be done prophetically; as Samuel is thought to
be named by Moses, [Psa 99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006.md), which
psalm is held to be made by him; or else might be put into it, in later
times, by some divine penman, endued with the same gift of prophecy, who
might improve the ground work of this psalm laid by Ethan, and set it to
an higher key; namely, that whereas he treated only of bodily
deliverance from Egypt, it is wound up so high as to reach the spiritual
delivery by Christ; and therefore David is often named, from whence he
should come.''

There was another Ethan, a singer, in David's time; and it is more
probable that he is the person, who might live to the times of Rehoboam,
and see the decline of David's family, and the revolt of the ten tribes
from it; or perhaps it was one of this name who lived in the times of
the Babylonish captivity, and saw the low estate that David's family
were come into; to which agrees the latter part of this psalm; and, in
order to comfort the people of God, he wrote this psalm, showing that
the covenant and promises of God, made with David, nevertheless stood
firm, and would be accomplished: the title of the Septuagint version
calls him Etham the Israelite; and the Arabic version Nathan the
Israelite: the Targum makes him to be Abraham, paraphrasing it

"a good understanding, which was said by the hand of Abraham, that came
from the east.''

But whoever was the penman of this psalm, it is "maschil", an
instructive psalm, a psalm causing to understand; it treats concerning
the covenant of grace, and the promises of it; and concerning the mercy
and faithfulness of God, in making and keeping the same; and concerning
the Messiah and his seed, his church and people; and the stability and
duration of all these: many passages in it are applied to the Messiah by
Jewish writers, ancient and modern; and [Psa
89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020.md) is manifestly referred to in
[Act 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#022.md).

[Psalms 89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 89:1</span></span>

I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever,.... Both temporal and
spiritual, especially the latter, in which there is a large display of
the rich and abundant mercy of God, from whence they are so called; as
in the choice of men to everlasting life, who are said to be vessels of
mercy; in the covenant of grace made with them, the blessings of which
are the sure mercies of David; in the mission of Christ, whose coming,
as the dayspring from on high, is owing to the tender mercy of our God;
in redemption by him, in which mercy and truth have met together; in
regeneration, which is according to abundant mercy; in the forgiveness
of sins, which is according to the multitude of his tender mercies; and
in the whole of salvation, which is not by works of righteousness, but
by the mercy of God through Christ: the word may be rendered "graces,
kindnesses, goodnesses" (l), and designs the abundance of grace; as in
the heart of God, in the covenant, in the hands of Christ, as displayed
through him, and in the several parts of salvation, and the whole of it:
and these are a proper subject for a song; and a truly gracious soul,
sensible of these things, thankful for them, cheerful on account of
them, and seeing his interest in them, cannot but "sing" of them; and
will determine to do it "for ever", every day, and all the day long, as
long as he lives, and while he has any being, and which he will do to
all eternity:

with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations; God
is faithful to himself, to all the perfections of his nature, to his
truth, holiness, and justice, he cannot deny himself; he is so to his
Son, and to all engagements with him, and promises to him; to all his
counsels, purposes, and decrees; all which are faithfulness and truth,
or faithfully and truly performed; and to his covenant and promises made
to his people in Christ, in whom they are all yea and amen: and that
this glorious perfection of God might be made known to the saints in all
successive generations, and be taken notice of by them, the psalmist
spoke and sung this psalm with his mouth, and penned it with his hand;
in which there is more mention made of the faithfulness of God than
perhaps in any other passage of Scripture besides; see [Psa
89:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 89:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 89:2</span></span>

For I have said,.... That is, in his heart he had said, he had thought
of it, was assured of it, strongly concluded it, from the Spirit and
word of God; he believed it, and therefore he spoke it; having it from
the Lord, it was all one as if he had spoke it:

[Psalms 89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 89:3</span></span>

I have made a covenant with my chosen,.... Not with Abraham, as the
Targum expresses it: but with David, as in the following clause; not
David, literally understood, though he was chosen of the Lord to be his
servant, and a covenant was made with him, and a promise made to him of
the perpetuity of his throne and kingdom in his family, [Psa
78:70](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070.md) but mystical David, the Messiah,
David's son and antitype; after, on this account, called David in
Scripture, [Eze 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md) and who is the
Lord's "chosen" One, foreordained to be the Redeemer of lost sinners,
chosen to be the Mediator between God and them, to be the head of the
church, and Saviour of the body; and his human nature was chosen to the
grace of union to the Son of God, [Psa
89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md), hence he is called God's elect,
[Isa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md) and with him the covenant of
grace was made from all eternity, and all the blessings and promises of
it were put into his hands; he is the Mediator, surety, and messenger of
it, and by his blood it is ratified and confirmed: the Septuagint render
it, in the plural number, "with mine elect ones"; and it is a truth,
that the covenant of grace is made with all the elect, considered in
Christ, and is made with them as such, and not as believers, converted
persons, &c. election is the foundation of the covenant, and the source
of all covenant blessings:

I have sworn unto David my servant: to the Messiah, called David, as
before observed, and who is the Lord's servant, as man and Mediator, of
his choosing, calling, sending, and supporting, [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md), to whom he swore, and he will
not repent; and which oath of his, joined to his covenant and promise,
makes for the strong consolation of the heirs of promise; see [Psa
89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035.md), the sum and substance of which
covenant and oath follow.

[Psalms 89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 89:4</span></span>

Thy seed will I establish for ever,.... Meaning not the natural seed of
David, at least not only them; whose family was indeed preserved, though
in very low circumstances, until the Messiah came, who sprung from
thence, [Luk 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#027.md), but the spiritual
seed of Christ, to whom it was promised that he should have a seed, and
should see and enjoy it, and which should endure for ever; see [Psa
89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md), and so he always has had a seed
to serve him in all generations, in the worst of times, and will; and
who are established in him, and will be kept and preserved by him, and
whom he will present to his Father, saying, "Lo, I and the children whom
thou hast given me", [Heb 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md).

and build up thy throne to all generations; and this shows that the
passage is not to be understood literally of David, and of his temporal
throne and kingdom, which did not last many generations; but of the
spiritual throne and kingdom of the Messiah, who sprung from him, called
the throne of his father David, whose throne is for ever and ever, and
whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, [Luk
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md), [Psa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006.md), his throne is in the heavens,
where he will reign until all enemies are put under his feet; and it is
also in the midst of his church, and in the hearts of his people, where
he reigns as King of saints; and he is on the same throne with his
Father; it is the same with his, as to glory, power, and authority; on
this he will sit, and judge the world at the last day; and on it he will
reign with his people a thousand years, in the New Jerusalem state, and
after that to all eternity, [Rev 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md).

Selah. See Gill on [Psa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 89:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 89:5</span></span>

And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord,.... Which, by a
prosopopceia, may be understood of the heavens literally, in the same
sense as other inanimate creatures praise the Lord, [Psa
148:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#003.md), or mystically of the church,
consisting of heaven born souls, and whose doctrines and ordinances are
from heaven; or of the apostles, as Jerom, who had their ministry,
mission, commission, and gifts, from thence; or rather of the angels,
the inhabitants of heaven, who praise the Lord for his wonderful works
of nature, providence, and grace, [Psa
148:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002.md), particularly they admire and
praise the wonderful work of redemption "that wonderful thing of thine"
(m), as the word may be rendered, being in the singular number: the
person of the Redeemer is wonderful, and that is his name; his
incarnation is a most amazing thing, it is the great mystery of
godliness; and the redemption wrought out by him is the wonder of men
and angels: when he appeared in the world, the angels of God worshipped
him; at his birth, they sung glory to God in the highest; and the
mysteries of his grace are what they look into with wonder and praise,
[Heb 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md),

thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints; i.e. is praised
there; which Aben Ezra and Kimchi interpret of the angels also, who are
called saints, [Deu 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md), of which
there is a congregation, even an innumerable company, [Rev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006.md), these not only admire and praise
the wonderful works of the Lord, but his perfections also; and
particularly his faithfulness in the execution of promises and
threatenings, [Rev 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#011.md), but rather
holy men are meant, such as are called to be saints, and are gathered
together in a Gospel church state, designed by a congregation of them,
among and by whom the truth and faithfulness of God, as well as his
lovingkindness and mercy, are spoken of with the highest commendation,
[Psa 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md).

[Psalms 89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 89:6</span></span>

For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord?.... Or "ranked"
(n), or put upon a par, with him; none of the angels in heaven; for
though they are holy, wise, knowing, powerful, faithful, kind, and
merciful creatures, yet not to be compared with the Lord for holiness,
wisdom, knowledge, strength, faithfulness, and mercy; see [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md),

who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord? the
Syriac version very wrongly renders it "the sons of angels", seeing
angels do not propagate their species, [Luk
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036.md) to which Kimchi agrees, who
makes the "mighty" to be angels, and their sons to be the host of
heaven, which are moved and guided by them: the Septuagint, Vulgate
Latin, Ethiopic, and Arabic versions, render it "the sons of God"; and
this phrase, indeed, is applicable to the angels, [Job
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007.md), and so the Targum interprets it
of the multitude of the angels; but rather the mighty men of the earth,
and their children, are meant; princes, nobles, judges, and civil
magistrates of all sorts, men of power and authority in the world; there
are none of them to be likened to the Lord, who is King of kings, and
Lord of lords; see [Psa 82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 89:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 89:7</span></span>

God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints,.... Which
Jarchi and Kimchi understand of angels again, and render it "God is to
be feared in the great assembly of them"; for they are a very large
number, even an innumerable company, in and by whom the Lord is feared
and worshipped, [Heb 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#021.md), but rather
an assembly or congregation of holy men are designed: it is the duty of
such to assemble together publicly for religious worship; they ought to
do it on account of the Lord, who requires it, and encourages it by his
presence, he has promised; on the account of themselves, it being for
their profit and pleasure; and on the account of others, for their
conversion and comfort; and in imitation of the people of God, in all
ages; nor should they forsake the assembling of themselves: the word
rendered "assembly", signifies "counsel" or "secret"; see [Gen
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006.md) and so the Targum,

"God is mighty in the secrets of the saints, sitting on a throne of
glory;''

in the assembly of the saints, the secrets of God's love are disclosed
unto them; the doctrines and mysteries of his grace, called the whole
counsel of God, [Act 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md) are there
made known; and the ordinances of the Gospel, which also are styled the
counsel of God, [Luk 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#030.md), are there
administered: now, where all this is done,

God is greatly feared herein; not with a slavish fear, a fear of hell
and damnation, such as may be in devils; nor with an hypocritical fear,
such as is taught by the precepts of men; but with a filial, godly fear,
such as is peculiar to the children of God; with an holy and humble
fear, with a fiducial and fearless one; with a reverential affection for
the Divine Being, and such as includes all worship of him, internal and
external: and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him;
which the Targum paraphrases

"and is to be feared above all the angels that stand round about him''

and so Kimchi interprets it; see [Rev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011.md), but the same thing, in different
words, is meant, as in the preceding clause.

[Psalms 89:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 89:8</span></span>

O Lord God of hosts,.... Of all the hosts of heaven, the sun, moon, and
stars, and of all the heavenly hosts of angels, of all the armies in
heaven, and the inhabitants of the earth:

who is a strong Lord like unto thee? he is Jah, or Jehovah, and he alone
is so, and is the most High in all the earth, [Psa
83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018.md) and there is none like him for
his great power and strength, by which he has made the heavens and the
earth, and upholds them in their being; and by which he has redeemed his
people, plucked them out of the hands of sin and Satan, and preserves
them safe to his kingdom and glory: see [Job
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#009.md),

or to thy faithfulness round about thee; none so faithful as the Lord,
none to be trusted as he, either angels or men; some understand it of
the faithful ones that are about him, his trusty servants the angels,
who stand round about him ready to do his will; or the glorified saints
that are with him, the called, chosen, and faithful; see [Psa
103:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019.md) or rather the words are to be
read, "and thy faithfulness is round about thee"; and so the Targum,

"and thy truth (or faithfulness) surroundeth thee:''

look all around him, and his faithfulness is everywhere to be seen; to
himself, and the perfections of his nature; to his Son, and agreements
with him; and to his counsels of old, his purposes and decrees, and to
his covenant and promises: he is as it were clothed with faithfulness,
and it appears in all the dispensations of his providence and grace.

[Psalms 89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 89:9</span></span>

Thou rulest the raging of the sea,.... The power, pride, and elation of
it, when it swells, and foams, and rages, and becomes boisterous, and
threatens vessels upon it with utter ruin and destruction; but the Lord,
who has it under his dominion and government, restrains it; he has made
and can manage it, and he only: his power over it is seen in assigning
it its place, and ordering the waters of it to it when first made; in
placing the sand for its boundary by a perpetual decree, which it cannot
pass; by commanding the stormy wind to lift up its waves, and by making
the storm a calm, and the waves thereof still; see [Psa
107:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#025.md), instances of this were at the
universal deluge, and at the Red sea:

when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them; when the sea lifts up
its waves, and both lift up their voice, and make a noise, and roar, the
Lord hushes them, and makes them still and quiet, as a parent its child
when it cries, or a master his scholars, when they are noisy and
tumultuous; so Christ rebuked the wind, and checked the raging sea, and
made it calm, when the ship in which he was with his disciples was
covered with its waves; and as this is mentioned here as an instance of
the great power and strength of the Lord of hosts, so that was a proof
and evidence of the true and proper divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[Mat 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024.md), all this may be understood,
in a mystical sense, of the sea of this world, and the wicked
inhabitants of it, who are as the troubled sea, and cannot rest, casting
up mire and dirt, reproaching and blaspheming God and man; and
particularly of tyrannical princes and potentates, who are like the
proud waters and raging waves of the sea; but the Lord on high is
mightier than they, and can and does restrain their wrath and rage, so
that his people have nothing to fear from them; see [Psa
124:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 89:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 89:10</span></span>

Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain,.... Or Egypt, as
in [Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md) or the Egyptians, and
particularly Pharaoh their king; so the Targum explains it,

"Rahab or the proud one, this is Pharaoh the wicked;''

who and his people were broken to pieces by the plagues that were
brought upon them, especially when all their firstborn were slain; and
he and his host were broke in pieces at the Red sea, and were seen by
the Israelites on the shore, all dead men; and this was done as easily
by the Lord, as one slain with the sword, as a dead carcass which has no
life, power, and strength to defend itself, may be trampled upon,
crushed, bruised, and broken to pieces, by a living man. All this may be
an emblem of the Lord's breaking in pieces the proud and insolent one
Satan, as Rahab signifies; of his breaking his head, destroying his
works, and spoiling his principalities and powers; and indeed of his
destruction of every proud and haughty sinner, that says, Pharaoh like,
who is the Lord, that I should obey him? and of every vain boaster, and
self-righteous person, that trusts in his own righteousness, and will
not submit to the righteousness of Christ; and particularly of mystical
Egypt, the proud beast of Rome, antichrist, who sits in the temple of
God as if he was God, showing himself to be so, blaspheming God, his
name, his tabernacle, and his saints; who will be broken to shivers as a
potter's vessel, when the vials of God's wrath are poured out, and at
and by the coming of Christ:

thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm; as the Egyptians
were in the Red sea, by the waves of it, and cast upon the shore by
them; and as the Amorites were by Moses, and the Canaanites by Joshua;
which instances may be here referred unto; see [Num
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md) these are further proofs of the
power and strength of the Lord, [Job
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#009.md).

[Psalms 89:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 89:11</span></span>

The heavens are thine,.... They are made and inhabited by him, they are
the work of his hands, and the seat of his majesty, and the throne of
his glory; the angels of heaven are his, his creatures and servants; the
several heavens are his, the airy, starry, and third heavens; the place
and state of the blessed and glorified saints is of his preparing and
giving:

the earth also is thine; the whole terraqueous globe, and all that is in
it, being made, preserved, and continued by him, and by him given to the
sons of men, [Psa 116:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015.md),

as for the world, and the fulness thereof: the habitable world, and all
that dwell therein, all the children of men, the beasts of the field,
and cattle on a thousand hills, and the provisions for them all; which
is the goodness of the Lord, the earth is full of; these are all the
Lord's; see [Psa 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md),

thou hast founded them; the world, and the inhabitants of it; the earth
is founded upon the seas, and the world upon nothing; and the
inhabitants are wonderfully preserved and continued by the power and
providence of God; see [Psa 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 89:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 89:12</span></span>

The two extreme parts of the world, the northern and southern poles,
whether inhabited or uninhabited, are created by the Lord, to answer
some purpose or another; see [Job
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md).

Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name; Tabor was a mountain in the
western part of Galilee, in the tribe of Zebulun, [Jos
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012.md). This mountain, according to Mr.
Maundrell (a), stands by itself in the plain of Esdraelon, about 1200 to
1800 yards within the plain; it has a plain area at top, most fertile
and delicious, of an oval figure, extended about six hundred yards in
breadth, and twice that in length; this area is enclosed with trees on
all parts, except towards the south, in which there are in several
places cisterns of good water. It is generally thought to be the
mountain Christ was transfigured upon before his disciples; and if so,
it might then be said to rejoice in his name, when he appeared in so
glorious a form upon it; Moses and Elias talking with him, and a voice
from the excellent Glory declaring him his beloved Son; and especially
the disciples rejoiced in his name there and then, who could say, It is
good for us to be here, [Mat 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md).
Hermon was a mountain called by the Sidonians Sirion, and by the
Amorites Shenir, [Deu 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008.md) and was in
the east; and so Mr. Maundrell (b), speaking of Tabor, says, not many
miles eastward you see Mount Hermon, at the foot of which is seated
Nain, famous for our Lord's raising the widow's son there, [Luk
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011.md), there was an Hermon near Mount
Tabor, thought likely to be here meant; but, be these mountains where
and what they may, they were no doubt very high and fruitful ones,
clothed with fruitful trees and grass, and covered with flocks; which
made the proprietors and all the beholders rejoice in the goodness,
wisdom, and power of God: the Targum in the king's Bible gives the four
quarters very truly,

"the desert of the north, and the inhabitants of the south, thou hast

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 89:13</span></span>

Thou hast a mighty arm,.... Christ is the arm of the Lord, and a mighty
one he is, and so is the Gospel, which is the power of God unto
salvation; here it seems to design the almighty power of God, displayed
in the works of creation and providence; see [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md).

strong is thy hand; thy "left hand", as some, it being distinguished
from his right hand, mentioned in the next clause; the Targum adds,

"to redeem thy people;''

the work of redemption was put into the hand of Christ, and it prospered
in his hand, and his own arm brought salvation to him; and his hand is
strong to keep and preserve his people, where they are put, and where
they are safe; and the hand of the Lord is strong to correct and
chastise them, and sometimes his hand lies heavy upon them, and presses
them sore, when it becomes them to humble themselves under his "mighty
hand": and it also strong to punish his and their enemies:

and high is thy right hand; when it is lifted up in a way of judgment
against wicked men, and for the defence of his people, then may it be
said to be exalted: and it is high enough to reach the highest and most
powerful of his adversaries; see [Psa
118:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#016.md). The Targum adds,

"to build the house of thy sanctuary.''

Some render (c) these two last clauses as a wish or prayer; "let thy
hand be strong, and let thy right hand be lifted up".

Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne,.... The seat and
throne on which he sits; all the administrations of his kingly power in
the government of the world, in the salvation of his people, and in the
punishment of his enemies, being according to the strict rules of
justice and judgment: or "the preparation of thy throne" (d); all that
the Lord does according to the counsel of his will; and these counsels
were of old, and were formed in strict justice and judgment, and were a
preparation for his future government in providence and grace: or "the
establishment of thy throne" (e); the throne of an earthly king is
established by righteousness; and so the throne of God, and of Christ,
is ordered and established with justice and judgment in the exercise of
righteousness for evermore, [Pro

mercy and truth shall go before thy face; be and appear wherever he is;
all his ways are mercy and truth, [Psa

sinners that come unto him by Christ; and "truth" in performing all his
purposes and promises; and these make the joyful sound next mentioned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 89:15</span></span>

Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound,.... Of the love,
grace, and mercy of God displayed in Christ, of peace and pardon by his
blood, of justification by his righteousness, of atonement by his
sacrifice, and of complete salvation by his obedience, sufferings, and
death; this is the sound of the Gospel, and a joyful one it is to
sensible sinners; and is so called in allusion either to a shout made
upon a victory gained, and such a sound is the Gospel; it declares
victory by Christ over sin, Satan, the world, and death, and every
enemy; and that he has made his people more than conquerors over them;
or to the jubilee trumpet, which proclaimed liberty and a restoration of
inheritances, [Lev 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009.md) and so the
Gospel proclaims liberty to the captives, freedom from the dominion of
sin, and condemnation by it, from the tyranny of Satan, and the bondage
of the law; and gives an account of the inheritance the saints have in
Christ, and through his death, to which they are regenerated, and for
which they are made meet by the Spirit of God, and of which he is the
seal and earnest: or to the silver trumpets, for the use of the
congregation of Israel, and blown at their solemn feasts, and other
times, and were all of a piece, [Num
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001.md), the trumpet of the Gospel gives
a certain sound, an even one, a very musical one; there is no jar nor
discord in it; is a soul charming alluring sound, and very loud; it has
reached, and will reach again, to the ends of the earth, [Rom
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md), it is a blessing to hear it,
but it is a greater to "know" it, not merely notionally, but spiritually
and experimentally; so as not only to approve of it, and be delighted
with it, but so as to distinguish it from all other sounds; and by faith
to receive it, and appropriate the things it publishes to a man's own
soul; and such must be "blessed", or happy persons, for the reasons
following in this verse, and in [Psa
89:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#016.md),

they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance: enjoy the
gracious presence of God, have the manifestation of himself, the
discoveries of his love, communion with him through Christ, and the
comforts of the Holy Spirit, and these continued; so that they shall
walk in the sunshine of these things, though not always; for sometimes
they walk in darkness, and see no light; but it is an unspeakable mercy
and blessing to walk herein at any time, for ever so short a season, see
[Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md).

[Psalms 89:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 89:16</span></span>

In thy name shall they rejoice all the day,.... That know the joyful
sound, and walk in the light of God's countenance, as they have reason
to do; these will "rejoice" in the Lord himself, for his "name" is
himself; in the perfections of his nature, as displayed in redemption
and salvation by Christ; in him as the God of all grace, as their
covenant God and Father in Christ, and the God of their salvation; and
they will rejoice in Christ, in his name, in which is salvation, and
therefore precious; in his person, blood, righteousness, sacrifice, and
fitness; and that "all the day" long, continually; there is always
reason, ground, and matter for rejoicing in Christ, though it is
sometimes interrupted by sin, temptation, and desertion; see [Phi
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004.md).

and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted; from a low estate of sin
and misery to an high estate of grace and glory; from a state of
condemnation and death to a state of justification of life; from being
beggars on the dunghill, to sit among princes, and to inherit the throne
of glory; such as are clothed with the righteousness of the Son of God
are exalted to great honour, as to be admitted into the presence of the
King of kings in raiment of needlework, to stand at his right hand in
gold of Ophir, and to live and reign with him for evermore in his
kingdom and glory.

[Psalms 89:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 89:17</span></span>

For thou art the glory of their strength,.... By which they walk, and do
all they do, exercise every grace, and discharge their duty; they have
their strength from Christ, as well as their righteousness, without whom
they can do nothing, but all things through him strengthening them; and
as his righteousness exalts them, his strength adorns and glorifies
them; how glorious and beautiful does a believer look, that is strong in
the Lord, and in the power of his might, in the grace that is in Christ,
and in the exercise of faith on him, giving glory to God; on whom the
power of Christ rests, and it overshadows, and in whose weakness his
strength is made perfect!

and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted; either Christ, the Horn of
their salvation, who in an acceptable time, in the time of God's favour,
or good will, was heard and helped by him as man, carried through his
sufferings and death, was raised from the dead, and exalted at his right
hand; see [Psa 89:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#024.md) or the saints
themselves, their power and strength, kingdom and glory; by the special
favour of God in Christ, their mountain is made so strong, and they so
highly exalted, as that they think they shall never be moved; and in the
latter day the mountain of the Lord's house shall be exalted above the
hills, [Psa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006.md).

For the Lord is our defence,.... From all their enemies, being all
around them, as a wall of fire to protect them, and as the mountains
were round about Jerusalem, and being kept by his power as in a
fortress, strong hold, or garrison, unto salvation; or our shield (f);
see [Psa 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009.md) as are his favour,
righteousness, and salvation, [Psa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012.md) or "to the Lord belongs our
defence or shield" (g) our protection and salvation is from him:

and the Holy One of Israel is our King; he who was to be, and is of
Israel according to the flesh, and is holy in his nature, life, and
office; he is King of saints, that rules over them, protects and defends
them, and therefore they must be happy: or "to" or "with the Holy One of
Israel is our king" (h); Christ is King of Zion by designation,
appointment, and constitution, of God the Holy One of Israel, the holy
God that has chosen Israel for his peculiar people; though it rather
seems that Christ is the Holy One by what follows.

Then thou spakest in vision to thy Holy One,.... Samuel the prophet,
that holy man of God, to whom the Lord spoke in vision, or by a spirit
of prophecy, concerning David, the choice and exaltation of him to the
kingdom, and his unction for it, [Sa1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md). The Vulgate Latin version reads
it "to thy Holy Ones": and so the Targum, with which agree the
Septuagint and Arabic versions, which render it "thy sons"; and the
Syriac version "his righteous ones", and so takes in Nathan also, to
whom the Lord spake in a vision, by night, concerning the settlement and
perpetuity of the kingdom in David's family, [Sa2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004.md), &c. Aben Ezra interprets it of
the singers, Heman, Ethan, and others; and Jarchi of Gad and Nathan: but
the whole is rather to be understood of David's son, the Messiah; and it
may be rendered "concerning thy Holy One" (i) as he is called, [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md), concerning whom in vision, that
is, in prophecy, see [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md). The
Lord said, by the mouth of his holy prophets, from the beginning of the
world, the following things:

and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; this "mighty" One
is the Messiah, the mighty God, the mighty Man, the mighty Mediator and
Redeemer; who was mighty to save to the uttermost, and was every way fit
for and equal to the work of a Redeemer; for which reason the Lord "laid
help" upon him, not for himself; for this is not to be understood of
help promised or given him as man and Mediator: this is after spoken of,
[Psa 89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021.md), but for others; and so the
Targum adds, "for my people": laying it on him is no other than ordering
or enjoining him, to which he agreed, to help his people out of that
miserable condition they were fallen into, through Adam's transgression,
and their own sins, out of which they could not help themselves: the
work assigned to Christ, and devolved on him in council and covenant,
was to help them out of this estate by price and power; and to help them
on in their way to heaven, through all difficulties, trials, and
temptations; and to help them to heaven itself, and introduce them
there: and being thus laid upon him, according to his Father's will and
purpose, and with his own consent, it was found in him, and exercised by
him, [Hos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md).

I have exalted one chosen out of the people; the same as before, the
Messiah, God's elect, his chosen One, [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md) "chosen" to be the head of the
church, to be the Mediator between God and man, and to be the Saviour
and Redeemer of lost sinners; to be the foundation and corner stone in
the spiritual building, and to be the Judge of quick and dead: and he
was "chosen out of the people"; out of the vast number of the
individuals of human nature God determined to create, there was a
certain number which he selected for himself, for his own glory, and to
be eternally happy with him; and out of these he singled one
"individuum" of human nature, to be united to the eternal Word, the
second Person in the Trinity; and which may be truly said to be the
"chiefest among", or, as the Septuagint version has it, "chosen out of
ten thousand", [Sol 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010.md), this the
Lord "exalted" to the grace of union to the Son of God, whereby it
became higher than angels and men, and to have a more excellent name
than either of them, it bearing the name of him to whom it is united,
[Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md), and he has exalted him to
the offices of Prophet, Priest, and King, for which he is

anointed above his fellows; and he has also, having done his work,
highly exalted him at his right hand; angels, principalities, and
powers, being subject to him.

I have found David my servant,.... Not David literally; but his Son and
antitype, the Messiah, who is sometimes called by his name; See Gill on
[Psa 89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003.md), and his "finding" him does
not suppose any ignorance of him, nor anxious solicitude in seeking him,
nor any

fortuitous event; but is attributed to God by an anthropopathy, or
speaking after the manner of men; for it is an act of the highest
wisdom, and richest grace, to find out, that is, to pick and appoint, in
council and covenant, his own Son to be his servant, to be the Redeemer
and Saviour of sinners, and to be a ransom for them, [Job
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024.md). The Apostle Paul seems to refer
to this passage in [Act 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#022.md).

with my holy oil have I anointed him: not with material oil, as David,
his type, [Sa1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md) but with the Holy
Ghost, which may well be called holy oil, in allusion to the holy
anointing oil under the law; the oil of gladness with which Christ was
anointed above his fellows, and without measure, at the time of his
conception and birth, at his baptism and ascension to heaven, and even,
in some sense, from all eternity; for so early is he said to be
anointed, and to be possessed with all fulness of grace, being invested
with and installed into his office as Mediator; and from this anointing
he has the name of Messiah and Christ, both which signify anointed, [Act
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038.md).

[Psalms 89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 89:21</span></span>

With whom my hand shall be established,.... A promise of God's gracious
presence with Christ, as man and Mediator, which is his work; of a
communication of grace and strength from him, to carry him through it;
and of his supporting and upholding him under it; which hand of his
power and grace would be always prepared and ready for him, as the word
(a) signifies, and stable and firm with him, so that he should have
success in it; the pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand; so
the Targum,

"for my hands are prepared for his help;''

the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and all the eastern versions, "mine hand
shall help him"; and which is confirmed in the next words: mine arm also
shall strengthen him; in the human nature, subject to and encompassed
with infirmities: this shows the greatness of the work of man's
redemption, which no creature could effect; it required the arm and
power of the Lord to be exerted, and by which Christ was made strong by
the Lord, both for himself, and for the working out of salvation for us;
which he did when he travelled in the greatness of his strength,
standing up under the mighty weight of our sins, and the wrath of God;
and yet failed not, nor was he discouraged, till his own arm brought
salvation to him; see [Psa 80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md).

The enemy shall not exact upon him,.... The enemy is the devil, as in
the interpretation of the parable of the tares, [Mat
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#039.md), the implacable enemy of Christ
and his church; and yet, notwithstanding all his enmity and malice, he
could not "exact", or get more inflicted on him, than the law and
justice of God required of him, as the sinner's surety; or could not
"exact" a tribute of him, or make him tributary to him; or, in other
words, conquer him, and subject him to him: so far from it, that he was
conquered by Christ, and all his principalities and powers spoiled; or
could not "deceive" him, in which sense the word (b) is sometimes used;
and so the Targum here: though he deceived Eve, he could not deceive the
Messiah, the seed of the woman; he tried it, in person, by his
temptations in the wilderness, and by his agents and instruments, the
Scribes and Pharisees: but in vain, and to no purpose; he could not
succeed:

nor the son of wickedness afflict him: at least not always: he was
indeed afflicted, as by wicked men, and by Satan the wicked one, yet not
so as to be overcome by any; and as Christ personal, so Christ mystical,
or his church and people, are afflicted by the sons of wickedness; yet,
sooner or later, they are delivered out of all their afflictions.
Antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that wicked one, that
is eminently so, and may be well called "the son of wickedness", has
long and greatly oppressed the people of Christ, and his interest; but
he shall not always; he shall be destroyed with the spirit of his mouth,
and with the brightness of his coming, [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md). This passage is applied to the
Messiah by the Jews (c).

But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him,.... The
"faithfulness" of God was and is with Christ, in performing promises
made to him respecting his work, and strength to do it, as man, and the
glory that should follow; and also those made to his people in him,
relating to grace here, and happiness hereafter: and though there was no
"mercy" shown to Christ, as the surety of his people, but he was dealt
with in strict justice; yet, as Mediator of the covenant, the special
mercy of God is with him, even every blessing of it, called "the sure
mercies of David"; and is only communicated through him; he is the mercy
seat, from whence mercy is dispensed, and the propitiation through whom
God is merciful to men; the words may be rendered, "my truth and my
grace" (e), as they are by the Targum; and both are with Christ, the
truth of doctrine, and all the fulness of grace, justifying,
sanctifying, pardoning, adopting, and persevering grace, [Joh

and in my name shall his horn be exalted, or "his glory", as the Targum;
his power and dominion, of which the horn is an emblem; and his glory is
displayed in having the same name his Father has: his name is expressive

title and office "King of Kings, and Lord of lords"; or his name the
Word of God, as the Targum; who, as such, is the brightness of his
Father's glory: or the sense is, that, by the power of God, he should be
raised from the dead, and have glory given him, and be exalted at his
right hand, and made Lord and Christ; or by means of the Gospel, which
is the name of the Lord, [Joh 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md),

dominion over the sea, and of his power and authority over all things in
it, which: he has by right of creation, and as Mediator, [Psa

the days of his flesh, [Mat 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026.md), but
of his kingdom taking place in, and of his government over the
inhabitants of the isles of the sea; and so the Targum,

"I will set or place his government in the provinces of the sea;''

and which has been remarkably accomplished in our isles, where his
Gospel has been preached, his kingdom set up, and he has had a race of
subjects, and a seed, to serve him for many years:

and his right hand in the rivers: or, as the Targum,

"the power of his right hand in those that dwell by rivers;''

meaning such that dwell upon the continent, afar off from the sea, and
whose countries are watered by rivers: so that both phrases denote the
extent of Christ's kingdom in the continent, and in the islands of the
sea; signifying, that it should reach everywhere, and be from sea to
sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth, [Psa

He shall cry unto me, thou art my Father,.... Not by creation, as he is
the Father of angels and men; nor by adoption, as he is the Father of
saints; but by generation, being the begotter of him, [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md) so that he is Christ's own and
proper Father, and Christ is his own and proper Son, [Joh

Father, and asserted him to be in this relation to him, [Joh
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md), [Joh

him, and prayed unto him as such, [Mat

the Mediator, Redeemer, and Saviour; who made a covenant with him, his
chosen; who prepared and provided the human nature of Christ; anointed
him with the gifts and graces of his Spirit, and supported him in his
sufferings, and crowned him with glory and honour; whom Christ loved as
his God, trusted in him as such, obeyed him, and prayed unto him: he
called him his God, owned him to be so, and called upon him, and cried
unto him, as such, [Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md). God is
the Father of Christ, as Christ is a divine Person; and he is the God of
Christ, as Christ is man: these two relations frequently go together in
the New Testament, [Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md). It is
added,

and the Rock of my salvation; that bore him up, and where he stood firm,
while he was working out the salvation of his people; and though he was
not saved from sufferings and death, yet he was quickly delivered from

and his people joint-heirs with him. Christ is God's "firstborn", or
"first begotten", [Heb 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md), being
begotten by him, and of him; and his firstbegotten, though none begotten
after him; as the first that opened the womb, under the law, was called
the firstborn, though none were ever born after; and in such sense his
first begotten, as that he is his only begotten: and he is the
firstborn, with respect to creatures; "he is the firstborn of every
creature"; [Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), being begotten
and brought forth before any creature was in being, [Pro
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md), and, with respect to the saints,
"he is the firstborn among many brethren", [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md), they are of the same nature, and
in the same family, and in which Christ is a son, and the firstborn; and
in all things he has the preeminence; and he is also "the firstborn from
the dead", or "the first begotten of the dead", [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md) being raised first from thence by
his own power, and to an immortal life; and is the first fruits of them
that sleep, and the efficient and meritorious cause of the resurrection
of life, and the pattern and exemplar of it: even him the Father
promises to make "higher than the kings of the earth"; having a kingdom
of a superior nature to theirs, and a more extensive and durable one;
and even they themselves shall be subject to him; hence he is called
"King of kings", [Rev 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016.md). This will
be when their kingdoms become his; when they shall fall down before him,
and worship him, and bring their riches and glory into his kingdom, or
the New Jerusalem church state, [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010.md). This passage is interpreted of
the Messiah by the Jews (f).

My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,.... That is, for his mystical
body, his church and people; for whom stores of mercy are kept with him,
to be laid out in their regeneration, pardon, salvation, and eternal
life; for to them the mercy of God is from everlasting to everlasting,
[Psa 103:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#017.md), unless this is to be
understood of the "grace" and "kindness" (g) of God, as the word may be
rendered; his free favour and love to Christ, which always continues;
for as he was always his dearly beloved Son, that lay in his bosom from
eternity, so he continued, throughout his state, of humiliation, his
well beloved, in whom he was well pleased, and still is, and ever will:

and my covenant shall stand fast with him; being made with him as the
head and representative of his people, it remains, and will remain,
sure, firm, and immoveable; its blessings are "sure mercies", and its
promises are all "yea and amen in Christ": the stability of it, and of
all that is in it, is owing to its being made with him, and being in his
hands, who is the surety, Mediator, and messenger of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 89:29</span></span>

His seed also will I make to endure for ever,.... Not a race of kings
from David, which ended at the Babylonish captivity; not the natural
seed of David, not the Messiah himself, who sprung from him, but the
Messiah's spiritual seed, which were given him by the Father, adopted
through him, regenerated by his Spirit and grace, begotten through his
Gospel, and the ministry of it, and born again in his church, and to
whom he stands in the relation of the everlasting Father, [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md). The "enduring" of these "for
ever" may denote the final perseverance of particular believers; which
may be concluded from the relation of Christ, as an everlasting Father
to them, who therefore must continue as his children; from his affection
to them, from which there can be no separation; from their security in
and by him, being in his hand, and in his heart; from their adoption,
which is never revoked, being sons they are no more servants; from their
regeneration of incorruptible seed; and from the nature of faith, which
can never be lost: they that trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion, which
endures for ever, [Psa 125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md) or it may
be expressive of the duration of the church of Christ in general,
throughout all periods of time, notwithstanding the malice and
opposition of men and devils against it; see [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md),

and his throne as the days of heaven; a phrase signifying a great length
of time, [Deu 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#021.md) yea, invariable
constancy and duration, [Jer 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#025.md) and
indeed the throne of Christ is for ever and ever, and will be when the
present earth and heavens are fled away, [Psa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006.md). Christ is upon a throne now in
heaven, the same with his divine Father's; and here he must sit and
reign, till all enemies are put under him; and he will be on a throne of
glory when he judges the world, and in the New Jerusalem state for the
space of a thousand years; and, after that, he will reign with his
saints, and they with him, for evermore; his throne and kingdom are
everlasting, [Isa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md).

If his children forsake my law,.... The same with the seed before
mentioned, the children of the Messiah: it is not said "if he forsakes",
which cannot be supposed of Christ, because he knew no sin, nor did any;
which yet might be supposed of David, had he been literally meant; but
not he, nor his natural children, but the spiritual seed of mystical
David, are here designed, who may sin, and do sin, of which there is too
much proof and evidence; and who sin not only through infirmity, but
sometimes very grossly, and which sins are here expressed by various
phrases: they sometimes "forsake the law of God"; do not attend to it,
as they should, as the rule of their walk and conversation; are remiss
in their observance of it, and obedience to it, and transgress its
precepts; or his "doctrine" (h), even the doctrine of the Gospel; which
may be said to be forsaken when men grow indifferent to it; go off from
it in any measure, drop their profession of it, or hold it remissly, or
become careless in their attendance on it: forsaking the assembling
together to hear it, in some sense, is a forsaking of it; and this the
Lord takes notice of, and resents, in his people:

and walk not in my judgments; those laws of his house by which he
judges, regulates, and governs his people; by which they are directed by
him, as their Judge and Lawgiver, how to behave themselves in the church
of God; and in which they are to walk, and continue in the observance
of; and so to do is to walk as becomes the Gospel, and worthy of their
calling; but to do otherwise is to walk disorderly; and such are
cognizable by the Lord, and by his people.

If they break my statutes,.... Fixed, settled, appointed ordinances;
such as are baptism and the Lord's supper, under the New Testament
dispensation; which are the things that are unshaken, and will remain
until the second coming of Christ: these are to be kept as they were
first delivered; no change and alteration ought to be made in them; so
to do is to break and violate them, or "profane" them, as the word (i)
here used signifies; and which may be done by an unbecoming, irreverent,
and indecent attendance on them; as was by some in the Corinthian
church, of which the apostle complains, and who for it were taken notice
of, and chastened by the Lord, [Co1
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002.md), and keep not my commandments;
which should be kept impartially, with great affection to them, from a
principle of love to the Lord, with a view to his glory, and without
trusting to and depending upon an obedience to them; for they are not
grievous; and, besides, "in", though not "for", keeping them, there is
great reward; and a contrary behaviour is displeasing to God: now this
particular enumeration of offences, that may be committed by the
children of God to Christ, show that all sorts of sins may be committed
by them; sins of omission and commission; sins against the law, and
against the Gospel; all but the unpardonable one; and that these, though
they are observed in a way hereafter mentioned, yet are all forgiven.

of men to chastise his people by, as he did of the neighbouring nations
of the Jews, when they sinned against him; and so the Targum interprets
it here,

"I will visit their transgressions by the hands of the tribes of the
ungodly;''

or with such afflictions as are common to men, [Co1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md), in a kind, humane, moderate
way, in measure, in judgment, and not in wrath and hot displeasure; or
in such like manner as a man chastises his children, which is in love,
[Deu 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#005.md).

and their iniquity with stripes; such as diseases of body, loss of
relations, crosses and disappointments in the world; not with the
stripes of divine vengeance, of vindictive justice, such as Christ, the

Nevertheless, my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,.... Or
"make it void" (k), not from Christ, who always was, and ever will be,
the dear Son of his love, even while he was obeying, suffering, and
dying; nor from all those that are in him, loved and chosen in him, from
everyone of his spiritual seed, who are all dear sons, and pleasant
children; and the love of God to his people is in Christ; and therefore
there can he no separation from it; nor will it ever depart from them,
or be utterly or at all taken from them, as to that itself, though
sometimes the manifestations of it are withdrawn from them; but the love
of God itself is invariable and unchangeable; see [Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md), nor is it removed when God
afflicts and chastens his people; for his chastenings are from love, and
in love; the reason why he chastens them is because he loves them, and
he loves them while he is chastening them; he visits and comforts them,
sympathizes with them, supports them, and supplies them, and makes all
things work together for their good, [Rev
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019.md),

nor suffer my faithfulness to fail; in making good his engagements to
Christ, in keeping the covenant made with him, and in fulfilling his
promises to his people; and even when he afflicts them, it is in
faithfulness to them; nor will he suffer them to be afflicted above what
they are able to bear, and will support them under it, and deliver out
of it, [Psa 119:75](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#075.md) or "I will not
falsify in my truth" (i); or falsify his word; he is faithful that has

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 89:35</span></span>

Once have I sworn by my holiness,.... Swearing is ascribed to God after
the manner of men, and is done in condescension to the weakness of his
people, and to remove doubts and hesitations from them, relating to
things spiritual and eternal; as to his everlasting love to them, his
covenant with them in Christ, and their perseverance in his grace; and
it is made by himself, or one or other of his perfections, as here by
his "holiness"; see [Amo 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002.md), and
indeed his holiness being his nature, is no other than he himself, the
holy God; and because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
that as sure as he was, and was holy, just, and true, he would make good
what he promises, [Heb 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md) and this
is done but once, once for all, that being sufficient; it need not be
repeated, nor is it ever revoked; when he swears, he never repents of
it, nor changes his mind; and it is to show the immutability of his
counsel that he swears at all, [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md),

that I will not lie unto David; he will not lie to any, he cannot, it is
impossible he should; it would be to deny himself, it is contrary to his
being as God, he is not a man that he should lie; it is contrary to his
character as the God of truth; he will not lie, neither in his counsel
nor covenant, in his purposes nor promises; these are the two immutable
things, in which it is impossible he should lie: and he has swore to it
that he will not lie to David, to David's son the Messiah, with whom the
covenant is made, and stands fast; all the prophecies concerning him he
has fulfilled; and all the promises made to him of help and assistance,
as man and Mediator, in his work, and of the reward of it, a glory with
him, he has made good.

His seed shall endure for ever,.... This is a confirmation by his oath
of what he had before said, [Psa 89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md)
which may be understood either of the perseverance of particular
believers, of everyone of the spiritual seed of Christ; or of the
duration of the church in general, throughout all ages, as before
observed; and these being matters of moment and importance, and of which
there are sometimes doubts in the minds of the Lord's people about them,
and that they may be firmly believed by them, he confirms them with an
oath; for God never swears to trivial things; and when he does swear, it
is to remove the doubts of his people, and make their minds easy:

and his throne as the sun before me; that is, shall continue as long as
it does; see [Psa 89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md), or shall be
bright, splendid, and glorious as the sun, so the Targum,

"and his throne light as the sun before me;''

meaning his church and kingdom, of which the throne is an emblem, and
which became so in Gospel times, clear and lucid as the sun, [Sol
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010.md), when day was made by the rising
of the sun of righteousness, and by the bright shining of the Gospel
ministry; and at particular periods since, as in the times of
Constantine, when the church was clothed with the sun, and at the
Reformation, when Christ appeared with a rainbow on his head, and his
face was as the sun, [Rev 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001.md) and
especially this will be the case of the church in the latter day, when
the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of
the sun seven fold, as the light of seven days; and when the city, the
church, will stand in no need of the sun, nor of the moon; and also in
the ultimate glory, when the saints will shine as the sun in the kingdom
of God; see [Isa 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md). This passage
is applied to the Messiah by the Jews (a).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 89:37</span></span>

It shall be established for ever as the moon,.... Either Christ's seed,
or throne, which comes to much the same sense; for by both are meant his
church and people, his kingdom and interest in the world; the moon is as
perpetual as the sun, and is used as elsewhere to signify the
continuance of the people, church, and interest of Christ, [Psa
72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md), for though the moon has its
spots, and is changeable, sometimes in the full, and sometimes in the
decline, yet always is, and always continues, and ever will; and so
though the people of God have their spots and imperfections, and are
sometimes on the decline in the frames and dispositions of their minds,
in the exercise of grace, in their spirituality, liveliness, and zeal,
and in their walk and conversation in the church and world; yet they
shall abide and persevere to the end; and though the church may be like
the moon in the wane, be declining as to numbers, gifts, and graces, yet
it shall continue and be established; it is sometimes indeed in a
fluctuating state, and is not always in the same place, but is removed
from one country to another; yet it always is somewhere, even though in
the wilderness, and ere long will be established on the top of the
mountains, and be no more a tabernacle that shall be taken down; see
[Psa 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008.md).

and as a faithful witness in heaven: or "in the sky or cloud" (b); some
understand this of the moon, others of both sun and moon; but it seems
best to interpret it of something distinct from either, even of the
rainbow, which though it does not always appear in the clouds, yet it
has appeared at times, and does and will unto the end of the world; and
be a faithful and an everlasting token and witness of the covenant of
God made with all creatures, that he will no more destroy the world by a
flood, [Gen 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#012.md), and is an emblem of
the covenant of grace, and of the continuance, perpetuity, and
immutability of it; see [Isa 54:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 89:38</span></span>

But thou hast cast off,.... Here begin objections to what is before
said, and swore to; even to the everlasting love of God, to Christ, and
to his seed, to the unchangeableness and unalterableness of the
covenant, and to the continuance and perpetuity of the kingdom and
church of Christ, taken from the dealings of the Lord with the Messiah
and his people; which were made either by the psalmist, under a spirit
of prophecy, foreseeing what would come to pass; or by the apostles and
church of Christ, about the time of his sufferings and death, and after;
when he seemed to be "cast off", and rejected by the Lord, particularly
when he forsook him, and hid his face from him, [Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md), as when he hides his face from
his people, it is interpreted by them a casting them off; see [Psa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md),

and abhorred; not that he abhorred the person of Christ, who was his own
Son, his beloved Son; nor his afflictions and sufferings, which were a
sacrifice of a sweet smelling savour to him; see [Psa
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024.md), though these might be
interpreted by others as if the Lord abhorred or rejected him; because
he suffered him to be used in the manner he was, and particularly to be
abhorred by the Jews, even by the nation in general, [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md), though the sins of his people,
which he had upon him, and for which he suffered, were an abhorring to
the Lord; and when he was made sin, he was made a curse:

thou hast been wroth with thine Anointed; with thy Messiah; not
Rehoboam, from whom the ten tribes were rent; nor Josiah, who was killed
by Pharaohnecho; nor Zedekiah, carried captive into Babylon; but the
true Messiah, the son of David, before said to be found by the Lord, and
anointed with his holy oil, [Psa
89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020.md), which is to be understood of
him, not as his own son, who was always the object of his love, but as
the sinner's surety, bearing the sins of his people, and all the wrath
and punishment due unto them; and so is reconcilable to the promise,
that lovingkindness should not be taken from him, [Psa
89:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033.md) and is no objection to it,
though made one.

[Psalms 89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 89:39</span></span>

Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant,.... His servant David
the Messiah, [Psa 89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003.md), meaning not
the covenant of circumcision, nor the covenant at Sinai, which were
really made void at the death of Christ; but the covenant of grace and
redemption made with Christ, which it was promised should stand fast,
and never be broken, [Psa 89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003.md), but
was thought to be null and void when the Redeemer was in the grave, and
all hopes of redemption by him were gone, [Luk
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021.md), but so far was it from being
so, that it was confirmed by the sufferings and death of Christ; and
every blessing and promise of it were ratified by his blood, hence
called the blood of the everlasting covenant, [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020.md),

thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground: by suffering
it to be cast to the ground, and used contemptibly; as when Jesus was
crowned with thorns, and saluted in a mock manner; when an "if" was put
upon his being the King of Israel, [Mat
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#029.md), and which seemed very
inconsistent with the promise, [Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md) that he should be made higher
than the kings of the earth; and yet so it was, and is; he is highly
exalted, made Lord and Christ, crowned with glory and honour, and is set
far above all principality and power, and every name that is named in
this world or that to come, notwithstanding all the above usage of him.

[Psalms 89:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#040.md)

Thou hast broken down all his hedges,.... Round about his vine, the
church; see [Psa 80:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#012.md). A famous
church was raised at Jerusalem, quickly after the death, resurrection,
and ascension of Christ, which seemed to be well filled, fenced, and
protected; but on a sudden a violent persecution arose, and the members
of it were made havoc of, and the ministers of the word were scattered
abroad, and which was the breaking down of the hedges; and what was done
to the church was taken by Christ as done to himself, as it is here
spoken of him; see [Act 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md), and this
might seem contrary to the word and oath of God, that his seed should
endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven, [Psa
89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md), when the first Christian church
was used in this manner; but that providence was overruled, for the
spread of the Gospel, and the interest of Christ, in other parts; see
[Act 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#004.md), and so no objection to what
is before said:

thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin; the same as before, the

are himself, when made havoc of by their persecutors, and they took
joyfully the spoiling of their goods, [Heb

spoiled, however, attempted to be spoiled, by false teachers, who are
the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines; crafty seducers, who
spoil Christians of their peace and comfort, through philosophy and vain
deceit, [Sol 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015.md). Christ himself may
be said to be spoiled, when he was stripped of his clothes by the Roman
soldiers, who also parted his garments, casting lots on his vesture;
when they that passed by his cross, as he hung upon it, reviled him, and
robbed him of his good name, and of his kingly and priestly offices; and
he is also spoiled by false teachers, who rob him of his deity, his
divine and eternal sonship, and of his satisfaction and righteousness,
by whom he is trodden under foot, and his blood counted as an unholy
thing; and so the Targum,

"all that pass by the way tread upon him;''

see [Heb 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md), these are they that
walk not in the right way; but go out of it, and choose their own way;
they are such as pass over the right way, or cross it; they are they
that transgress, and abide not in the doctrine of Christ, that so use
him, [Jo2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#009.md),

he is a reproach to his neighbours; his name and character were
reproached by the Jews, his countrymen, who called him a glutton and a
wine bibber; and represented him as a notorious sinner; his miracles as
done by the help of Satan; his doctrine as hard sayings, novel opinions,
contrary to common sense and reason, and tending to licentiousness; and
his followers and members as the offscouring of all things: but all this
has been or will be rolled off, and is no objection to the glory
promised him.

[Psalms 89:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">psa 89:42</span></span>

Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries,.... Suffered them to
become powerful, and to prevail against him; as the wicked Jews, and
Satan, and his principalities and powers, at the time of Christ's
apprehension, crucifixion, and death; for then were their hour, and the
power of darkness, [Luk 22:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053.md), death
also had dominion over him, and held him under the power of it for
awhile: the enemies of his interest, Rome Pagan, and Rome Papal, have,
in their turns, had their right hands set up, and have had power, and
prevailed over it; and the latter will again, at the slaying of the
witnesses: all which, though it seems contrary to [Psa
89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021.md), yet is not; for Satan, though
he bruised Christ's heel, yet Christ bruised his head, destroyed his
works, and him himself, and that by dying; and spoiled his
principalities and powers; and death could not hold him long, nor has it
now any dominion over him, and is abolished by him; and antichrist, and
all the antichristian powers, will be destroyed by him ere long:

thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice; as they did when they had got
him on the cross; and especially when he was laid in the grave, [Psa
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007.md), and as the antichristian party
will when his witnesses are slain, [Rev
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010.md), but as the joy of the former
was short lived, and was soon turned into sorrow, so will be that of the
latter.

[Psalms 89:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">psa 89:43</span></span>

Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword,.... Or the "sharpness" (a)
of it blunted it, so that it could do no execution: the disciples of
Christ were not allowed the use of the temporal sword to defend their
master; and his house, his kingdom, not being of this world, [Mat
26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051.md), other weapons were put into
their hands; the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; and the
edge of this was blunted, with respect to the Jews, being of little or
no efficacy among them; it was turned off by them, and put away from
them; but then it was turned towards the Gentiles, and was powerful and
effectual among them; Christ girt it on his thigh, and rode forth in his
glory and majesty, conquering, and to conquer, and by it subdued many,
who fell under him, and gave up themselves unto him; see [Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017.md), and ere long, with the twoedged
sword, which proceeds out of his mouth, will he smite the antichristian
nations; and the remnant of those that escape at the battle of
Armageddon shall be slain with it, [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md),

and hast not made him to stand in the battle; but to fall in it, being
delivered up into the hands of wicked men, of justice, and death; and
yet, by dying, he put away sin, finished it, made an end of it, and
destroyed it; he conquered Satan, and led him captive; overcame the
world, the spite and malice of it, and its prince; and abolished death
itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">psa 89:44</span></span>

Thou hast made his glory to cease,.... The glory of his deity, though it
did not properly cease, yet it seemed to do so, being covered, and out
of sight, and seen but by a very few, while he appeared in the likeness
of sinful flesh; and the glory of his humanity was made to cease, in
which he was fairer than the children of men, and his visage was more
marred than any man's, and his form than the sons of men; and the glory
of his offices, prophetical, priestly, and kingly, which were reproached
and vilified, and disputed and contradicted by the Jews, [Mat
26:68](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#068.md), it may be rendered, "his
purity" (b), which seemed to cease when he was clothed with our filthy
garments; or had all our sins laid upon him, and imputed to him, by his
Father; and he was made sin for us, who knew none: the Targum is,

"thou hast made the priests to cease who sprinkle upon the altar, and
purify his people:''

and cast his throne down to the ground; this seems contrary, and is an
objection to [Psa 89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md), but is not;
for not withstanding the usage of Christ by the Jews, who rejected him
as the King Messiah; see Gill on [Psa
89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md), yet he is now upon the same
throne with his Father, and will sit upon a throne of glory when he
comes to judge the world, and so in the New Jerusalem church state, and
to all eternity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">psa 89:45</span></span>

The days of his youth hast thou shortened,.... His days of joy and
pleasure; such as days of youth are, in opposition to the days of old
age, which are evil, [Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md), these
were shortened when his sorrows and sufferings came on, and God hid his
face from him; and indeed he was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief all his days: the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "the days of
his time"; and the Arabic version "the days of his years"; for he did
not live out half the time of man's age, which is threescore years and
ten, [Psa 90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010.md), he dying at the age
of thirty three or four; but, notwithstanding this, he lives again, and
lives for evermore; he has length of days for ever and ever, [Psa
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md), though his days were in some
sense shortened, yet in another sense they are and will be prolonged,
even his own, and those of his spiritual seed, according to the promise
of God, [Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md),

thou hast covered him with shame; see [Psa
69:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#007.md), when his face was covered with
shame and spitting, from which he hid it not, [Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006.md), but now he is crowned with glory
and honour; wherefore all these complaints, though true, are no
objections to what is before said and swore to.

[Psalms 89:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">psa 89:46</span></span>

How long, Lord, wilt thou hide thyself? for ever?.... When God hides his
face front his people, though it is but for a little while, it seems
long, and a kind of an eternity to them; and so it seemed to the man
Christ Jesus; and indeed what he endured, when his Father hid his face
from him, was of the same kind with an eternal absence; see [Psa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md),

shall thy wrath burn like fire? it did so when Christ bore the sins of
his people, and all the punishment due unto them; when his strength was
dried up like a potsherd; when he, the antitype of the passover lamb
roasted with fire, was sacrificed for us; all which is entirely
consistent with God's everlasting and invariable love to him, as his own
Son. See Gill on [Psa 89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md).

[Psalms 89:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">psa 89:47</span></span>

Remember how short my time is,.... In this world man's time here is
fixed, and it is but a short time; his life is but a vapour, which
appeareth for a little while; his days are as an hand's breadth; they
pass away like a tale that is told; the common term of life is but
threescore years and ten, and few arrive to that: to know and observe
this is proper and useful; it may awaken a concern for a future state,
excite to a vigorous discharge of duty, and animate to patience under
afflictions: the clause in connection with the preceding verse seems to
be a plea for mercy; that, since time was short, it might not be
consumed in bearing the wrath of God; but be spent in peace and comfort,
like that of [Job 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020.md), Compare with
this [Psa 103:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013.md), the Targum is,

"remember that I am created out of the dust:''

but these words, with what follow, are the words of the psalmist,
representing the apostles of Christ, and other saints, at the time of
his sufferings and death, and when under the power of the grave, and
when they were almost out of hope of his resurrection: see [Luk
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021.md), expostulating with the Lord on
that account; and here entreat him to remember the shortness of their
time, if there was no resurrection from the dead, as there would be none
if Christ rose not; and therefore, as their life was a short one, it
would be of all men's the most miserable:

wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? none of the sons of men are
made in vain; for they are all made for the glory of God, which end is
answered, some way or another, in everyone of them; either in the
salvation of them by Christ, or in the just destruction of them through
their own sin; and though the time of life is short, and afflictions
many, yet men are not made in vain, and especially those of them who
believe in Christ; for, for them to live is Christ, they live to his
glory: whether they live a longer or shorter time, they live to the
Lord; and when they die, they die to him; and their afflictions are
always for good, temporal, or spiritual, and eternal: indeed, if there
was no future state after this, men might seem to be made in vain, and
there might be some reason for such a question or complaint; but so it
is not; there is an immortal life and state after this, either of bliss
or woe: also, if there was no such thing as the redemption,
justification, and salvation of any of the sons of men, through the
sufferings and death of Christ, and which could not be without his
resurrection from the dead, with a view to which the question is put,
then there would seem some room for it; but there is a redemption of
them, and therefore are not made in vain; and Christ, who was delivered
for their offences, is risen for their justification.

[Psalms 89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">psa 89:48</span></span>

What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?.... Every living
man must die; as sure as a man lives, so sure he shall die: be he strong
and mighty, as the word signifies, or weak and sickly; be he high or
low, rich or poor, prince or peasant, righteous or wicked; persons of
all ranks, states, and conditions, age or sex, must die; for all have
sinned; and it is the appointment of God that they should die, and very
few are the exceptions; as Enoch and Elijah, and those that will be
found alive at Christ's coming:

shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave; either from going
down into it, or coming under the power of it; so the Targum,

"what man is he that shall live, and shall not see the angel of death
([Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014).md) shall he deliver his soul
from his hand, that he should not go down to the house of his grave?''

or deliver himself from the power of it, when in it; that is, raise
himself from the dead: none ever did this, or ever can: Christ indeed
undertook, and has promised, to redeem his people from the power of the
grave, upon which they have believed they should be delivered; see [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md), but if Christ rose not himself,
which was the thing now in question, how could it be? the case stands
thus; every man must die; no man can raise himself from the dead; if
Christ rise not, everyone must continue under the power of the grave;
for then there could be no resurrection.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">psa 89:49</span></span>

Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses,.... The spiritual blessings
said to be in Christ; the grace said to be given to us in him; the sure
mercies of David, such as redemption, justification, remission of sins,
and eternal life; so called because they flow from the free favour and
love of God, and, being many, are expressed in the plural number; and
which were former or ancient ones, even promised and secured in Christ
before the world began; springing from the love of God, which, both to
Christ and his people, was from everlasting, and provided for in a
covenant, which was as early:

which thou swarest unto David in thy truth? which were promised to
Christ, the antitype of David, and that with an oath, by the truth or
faithfulness of God, for the certainty thereof: but now where are all
these? or how will they take place, if Christ rise not from the dead?
where will be the redemption of his people, the justification of their
persons, the remission of their sins, and their everlasting salvation?
and what will become then of the covenant, oath, and faithfulness of
God?

[Psalms 89:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">psa 89:50</span></span>

Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants,.... The apostles of
Christ, his servants, and the servants of the living God, that showed
unto men the way of salvation, and other saints with them that believed
in Christ, and were made willing to serve and follow him; these were now
reproached by the Scribes and Pharisees for believing in him, and
professing him; and were scoffed and laughed at, when they had crucified
him, and laid him in the grave, triumphing over him and them, believing
he would never rise again, as he had given out he should, and for which
his followers were reproached; and therefore desire the Lord would
remember the reproach cast upon Christ, and them, for his sake, and roll
it away:

how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people; the
ecclesiastical and civil rulers of the Jews, their chief priests,
Scribes, and Pharisees, who poured out their reproaches very plentifully
on the followers of Christ, whom the psalmist here represents; which
fell very heavily upon them, as a very great weight and burden, and
pressed them sore, and went to their very hearts, and therefore said to
be "in their bosom"; and which is mentioned to excite the divine
compassion, that he would appear for them, and raise his Son from the
dead, as was promised and expected; that their enemies might have no
more occasion to reproach him and them: it is in the original, "I bear
in my bosom all the many people" (c); which some understand of the
people of God, and of Christ's sustaining their persons, and making
satisfaction for their sins; but the other sense is preferable: Kimchi
supplies the words as we do; and so the Targum, which renders them thus,

"I bear in my bosom all the reproaches of many people.''

[Psalms 89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">psa 89:51</span></span>

Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Lord,.... Which carries in it
another argument why the Lord should take notice of these reproaches;
because they come not only from their enemies, but from his also, and
the enemies of his Son, who would not have him, the King Messiah, to
reign over them, and are said to reproach him in the next clause:

wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine Anointed; or thy
Messiah; so Aben Ezra and Kimchi interpret it of the Messiah: Jarchi
renders it "the ends of the Messiah"; and all of them understand it of
the coming of the Messiah, as in the Talmud (d); which, because delayed,
or was not so soon as expected, was scoffed at and reproached by wicked
men; see [Mal 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017.md), but it rather
designs the ways and works, actions, and especially the miracles of
Christ, which were reproached, either as done on the sabbath day, or by
the help of Satan; and he was traduced in his kindest actions to the
bodies and souls of men, as a friend of publicans and sinners, and
himself as a sinner: and it may have a particular view to the latter end
of the Messiah, the last part of his life, his sufferings and death, and
when he hung on the cross; at which time he was, in the most insolent
manner, reviled and reproached by his enemies: the words may be rendered
"the heels of the Messiah" (e), and are thought by some to have
reference to the promise in [Gen 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md),
and may regard either the human nature of Christ, which was both
reproached and bruised; or his members suffering disgrace and
persecution for his sake, and which he takes as done to himself. Suidas
(f) interprets it of the ancestors of Christ, according to the flesh;
and Theodoret of the kings of that time.

[Psalms 89:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">psa 89:52</span></span>

Blessed be the Lord for evermore,.... In this world, and in the world to
come, as the Targum; for reproaches and afflictions for Christ's sake,
since they work together for good; as Job blessed the Lord in the midst
of his troubles, [Job 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md), or rather
the psalmist, viewing, by a spirit of prophecy, Christ rising from the
dead, ascending to heaven, sitting at the right hand of God, and
interceding for the application of all the blessings of the covenant;
and now, seeing all before objected and complained of was reconcilable
to the love, covenant, and oath of God, breaks out into this
benediction, and with it closes the psalm; which agrees with Christ, not
only as God over all, blessed for ever, but as Mediator, who, as such,
is made most blessed for evermore; see [Psa
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md). These are not the words of the
copier of the Psalms, blessing God for assistance in prosecuting the
work thus far, which is the sense of some Jewish writers mentioned by
Aben Ezra and Kimchi, but of the psalmist himself:

Amen, and Amen; which words are added to express the wish and faith of
the psalmist; and the word is repeated to denote the vehemence and
strength of the same. Here ends the third part of the book of Psalms,
and so the Syriac version closes it. See Gill on [Psa
41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013.md). See Gill on [Psa
