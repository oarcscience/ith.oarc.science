INTRODUCTION TO JUDGES 5

This chapter contains a song of praise on account of the victories
obtained over Jabin, and his kingdom; after an exhortation to praise is
given, and kings excited to attend to it, the majestic appearance of God
at Seir, on Sinai, is observed, to raise in the mind a divine veneration
of him, [Jdg 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#001.md); then the miserable
state and condition Israel was in before these victories, and therefore
had the more reason to be thankful, [Jdg
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006.md); the governors, and judges, and
the people that were delivered, together with Deborah and Barak, are
stirred up to rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord, and bless his
name, [Jdg 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#009.md); and those who
willingly engaged in the war are praised, and such who were negligent
reproved, and some even cursed, [Jdg
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014.md); but Jael, Heber's wife, is
particularly commended for her exploit in slaying Sisera, [Jdg
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024.md); and the mother of Sisera, and
her ladies, are represented as wondering at his long delay, and as
assured of his having got the victory, [Jdg
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#028.md); and the song is concluded with a
prayer for the destruction, of the enemies of the Lord, and for the
happiness and glory of them that love him, [Jdg
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#031.md).

[Judges 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 5:1</span></span>

Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam,.... Deborah is first
mentioned, because she was, as Kimchi says, the root or foundation of
the work, the chief person in it, both in the direction of the war, and
in the composition of this song; and indeed, as Ben Gersom observes, she
alone composed it, see [Jdg 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#007.md); and
the verb is singular: "then sang Deborah"; and after her, and in her
words, sung also Barak; he joined with her, not in making the song, but
in singing it; and so likewise the people of Israel joined with her in
singing it, as they did with Moses at the Red sea; and this song was
sung

on that day; not on the precise day on which the victory was obtained
over Sisera and his army, but on occasion of that memorable day, and
what followed upon it:

saying; the following divine hymn or song, penned by Deborah, under
divine inspiration, as the sublimity of the style, the fine and noble
thoughts and sentiments that are in it, the beautiful and elegant
phrases in which they are expressed, abundantly show; no Sappho, or any
Grecian poetess, nor indeed any poet whatever, uninspired, being equal
to the writer of this poem.

[Judges 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 5:2</span></span>

Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel,.... The injuries done to
Israel by any of their enemies, and particularly what wrongs had been
done them by Jabin, king of Canaan, for twenty years past; though some
understand it of the vengeance God took on Israel for their sins; and
though praise is not given directly for that, yet inasmuch as, when that
was the case, there were some whose spirits were stirred up to engage
voluntarily in the deliverance of them from the oppression of their
enemies, it was matter of praise:

when the people willingly offered themselves: to go and fight for Israel
against their enemies, particularly those of the tribes of Zebulun and
Naphtali, [Jdg 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#018.md); though not
excluding others that joined, who could not have been forced to it, had
they not freely offered themselves; and which was owing to the secret
influence of divine Providence on their hearts, moving and drawing them
to this service; and therefore praise was due to the Lord on this
account, who works in the hearts of men both to will and to do, as in
things spiritual and religious, so in things natural and civil.

[Judges 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 5:3</span></span>

Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes,.... Not only the neighbouring
ones, but all the kings and princes of the earth, far and near, then and
in succeeding ages; Deborah desires and wishes that all potentates might
hear of the wonderful works of God done for his people, that they might
learn to know there is one that is higher than they, to whom all the
amazing things done in the world are to be ascribed; and be cautious how
they oppressed the people of God, since sooner or later he would avenge
them on them. The Targum restrains this to the kings that came with
Sisera and the governors with Jabin; but if there were any such, as it
is not improbable there were, see [Jdg
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md); yet it is most likely that they
were slain with them: there are some, as Kimchi observes, who think this
respects the people of Israel, who were all the sons of kings; but the
first sense is best:

I, even I, will sing unto the Lord, I will sing praise to the Lord God
of Israel: which are the words of Deborah particularly, and the
repetitions serve to express how cordial, earnest, and vehement she was
in her praise and thankfulness to God; thereby setting an example to
others, encouraging them to the same practice, and directing persons of
every rank and quality to give praise only to Jehovah, the
self-existing, everlasting, and unchangeable Being; to him who is the
Lord and God of Israel in a peculiar manner, and not to any of the gods
of the Gentiles.

[Judges 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 5:4</span></span>

Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the
fields of Edom,.... Here properly begins the song, what goes before
being but a preface to it; and it begins with an apostrophe to the Lord,
taking notice of some ancient appearances of God for his people, which
were always matter of praise and thankfulness; and the rather are they
taken notice of here, because of some likeness between them and what God
had now wrought; and this passage refers either to the giving of the law
on Sinai, as the Targum and Jarchi; see [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md); or rather, as Aben Ezra, Kimchi,
and others, to the Lord's going before Israel, after they had
encompassed the land of Edom, and marched from thence towards the land
of Canaan, when they fought with Sihon and Og, kings of the Amorites,
and conquered them; which struck terror into all the nations round about
them, and the prophecies of Moses in his song began to be fulfilled,
[Exo 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014.md); and which dread and terror
are expressed in the following figurative phrases:

the earth trembled; and the like figure Homer (a) uses at the approach
of Neptune, whom he calls the shaker of the earth, perhaps borrowed from
hence; it may design the inhabitants of it, the Amorites, Moabites,
Edomites, Philistines, Canaanites, and others:

and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water; which, as it may
literally refer to the storm and tempest of rain that might be then as
now, see [Jdg 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015.md), so may
figuratively express the panic great personages, comparable to the
heavens and the clouds in them were thrown into, when their hearts
melted like water, or were like clouds dissolved into it.

\(a\) ' , Iliad. 13. v. 18, 34, 44.

[Judges 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 5:5</span></span>

The mountains melted from before the Lord,.... The inhabitants of them,
through fear, the Lord going before Israel in a pillar of cloud and
fire, and delivering mighty kings and their kingdoms into their hand:

even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel; or, "as that Sinai",
the note of similitude being wanting; and the sense is, the mountains
melted, just as the famous mountain Sinai in a literal sense did, when
it trembled and quaked at the presence of God on it; the tokens of it,
the fire and smoke, thunders, lightnings, and tempests there seen and
heard; and which being observed, would call to mind the benefit Israel
then received, which required praise and thankfulness, as well as would
serve to express the awe and reverence of God due unto him.

[Judges 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 5:6</span></span>

In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath,.... Of whom see [Jdg
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md); who succeeded Ehud as a judge,
but lived not long, and did not much; at least wrought not a perfect
deliverance of the children of Israel; but during his time till now,
quite through the twenty years of Jabin's oppression, things were as
they are after described:

in the days of Jael; the wife of Heber the Kenite, spoken of in the
preceding chapter, [Jdg 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017.md), who
appears to be a woman of masculine spirit, and endeavoured to do what
good she could to Israel, though not a judge among them, as Jarchi
suggests; and who before this affair of Sisera had signalized herself by
some deeds of hers in favour of Israel, and against their enemies; yet
far from putting a stop to the outrages committed; for in the times of
both these persons:

the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways;
the public roads were so infested with thieves and robbers, who stopped
all they met with, and robbed them of what they had, that travellers and
merchants with their carriages were obliged either to quit their
employments, and not travel at all; or, if they did, were obliged to go
in private roads, and roundabout ways, to keep clear of those rapparees
the highways and public roads abounded with.

[Judges 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 5:7</span></span>

The inhabitants of the villages ceased,.... Not only did those
Canaanitish robbers go upon the highway, and robbed all they met with,
which made travelling difficult and dangerous; but entered into the
villages and unwalled towns, and broke into houses and plundered them;
so that the inhabitants of them were obliged to quit their dwellings,
and go into the fortified cities for security; by which means the
villages were left empty, and in time fell to ruin, and ceased:

they ceased in Israel: for they were the villages which belonged to the
Israelites that were plundered, and not those that belonged to any of
the Canaanites; and these were the unhappy circumstances Israel were
under

until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel; until it
pleased God to raise her up, and endow her in a very wonderful and
extraordinary manner with gifts qualifying her to be a nursing mother to
Israel, to teach and instruct them in the mind and will of God, to
administer judgement and justice to them, to protect and defend them,
and in all which she discovered a maternal affection for them; and as a
good judge and ruler of a people may be called the father of them, so
she, being a woman, is with propriety called a mother in Israel, having
an affectionate concern for them as her children: now, till she arose,
there was no perfect salvation and deliverance wrought for them, since
the death of Ehud, even throughout the days of Shamgar and Jael; which
is observed to excite praise and thankfulness on the present occasion,
which hereby became the more illustrious.

[Judges 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 5:8</span></span>

They chose new gods,.... That is, Israel, as most of the Jewish
commentators interpret it; for the verb is singular, and Israel agrees
well with it: this they did after the death of Joshua; it refers to
their first idolatry, begun by Micah, [Jdg
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001.md) they chose other gods than the
true God; Baalim and Ashtaroth they are said to serve, [Jdg
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md), and besides the gods of the
Canaanites and Phoenicians, they sought after and introduced new ones
from other places, or the same may be meant; since all besides the true
God, the eternal Jehovah, the Ancient of days, and everlasting King, are
new gods that lately sprung up: the Arabic and Syriac versions are,"God
chose a new king;''so Ben Gersom; to perfect this wonder; for not only
Sisera and his army were drawn to the gates of Israel to a proper place
to fall in, but the victory was not obtained by Israel by their own
force and strength; for they had no weapons of war, not a shield nor a
spear, but for a very few men, but it was the Lord that fought for them
in a new way; the former sense seems best, and agrees with what follows:

then was war in the gates; when they fell into idolatry, then God
suffered the judgment of war to come upon them, even into the gates of
their fortified cities, which were the security of them, and where were
their courts of judicature, but by war disturbed and made to cease:

was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel? though
the number of the Israelites were several hundred thousands, yet there
were not to be seen among them shields and spears sufficient for 40,000;
or not one among 40,000 was armed; which was owing either to their
negligence and sloth in not providing themselves with arms, or not
taking care of them in a time of peace; so that when war came into their
gates, they had nothing to defend themselves with, or annoy their
enemies; or to their cowardice, not daring to take up a shield or spear
in their own defence; or to the enemy, Jabin king of Canaan, having
disarmed them, that they might not be able to make a revolt, from him,
and recover their liberties. Ben Gersom refers it to the times of
Joshua, when there was no need of a shield and spear among the 40,000 of
the children of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, that came over Jordan with
them, since God fought for them; and the Targum seems to understand it
of Sisera's army, that came against Israel with shields, spears, and
swords; and makes the number of them to be in all 300,000, which is just
the number of foot soldiers Josephus makes his army to consist of; and
yet, though so numerous and so well armed, could not stand before Barak
with 10,000 men only; See Gill on [Jdg
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017.md), the words rather refer to the
cival war of the Benjamites with the Israelites, when 40,000 of the
latter were killed, which was before the times of Deborah, [Jdg
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#021.md).

[Judges 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 5:9</span></span>

My heart is towards the governors of Israel,.... Most of the Jewish
commentators interpret this of their wise men and Scribes, who were
willing to teach the people the law and the commandments, even in times
of trouble, and did not cease from doing it on that account, and
therefore Deborah praises them for it; so the Targum; but Kimchi and Ben
Melech understand by them the great men of the nation, their nobles and
rulers, who enacted good laws and statutes; or at least took care to see
that the good laws they had were put in execution; and these had a share
in the affections and good wishes of Deborah, and that chiefly for the
following reason:

that offered themselves willingly among the people; to go along with
them, and march at the head of them, to fight Sisera and his army;
thereby setting a good example, and animating the people to battle, and
inspiring them with courage and intrepidity; when they saw their chiefs
and the heads of them exposing their lives with them in defence of their
country, and the rights of it:

bless ye the Lord; for giving them such spirits, to engage so willingly
in this service, and for giving them success in it.

[Judges 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 5:10</span></span>

Speak, ye that ride on white asses,.... Though in some countries, as in
ours, it is reckoned disgraceful to ride on asses; so Leo Africanus (b)
makes mention of a preacher in Africa, who was called the ass rider;
because he was continually, sitting on an ass; yet in Judea, where there
were no horses, or very few, it was accounted honourable; so it was in
the time of our Lord; for his riding on an ass to Jerusalem was not mean
and disgraceful, but honourable and glorious: and so it certainly was in
those early times of the judges; for we read of the sons of two of them,
which were very numerous, that rode on asses' colts, [Jdg
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004.md), and it seems that white asses
were the most valuable, and chiefly used by great personages. The ass in
the Hebrew language has its name from redness, that being the usual
colour of them in those parts; and hence they were hateful to the
Egyptians, because that their Typhon was of that colour (c); but there
were some that were white, as there are wild ones now of that colour. A
traveller (d) in those parts in the beginning of the last century tells
us, that on the banks of the Euphrates they beheld every day great
droves of wild beasts, as wild asses "all white", &c. The word we
translate "white" is "zechorot", and perhaps may describe the same
animal the Ethiopians call "zecora", and some "zebra"; said to excel in
beauty all four footed creatures in the whole world. It is an animal of
the size of a mule, found in the woods beyond Abyssinia, is easily
tamed, and is the frequent and chief present of the kings of that
country; about its loins is a circle of a black colour, in the form of a
girdle, which is followed with more on each side, according to the part
of the body, some broader, others narrower, both black and white, or of
an ash colour, so neat that they seem to exceed the art of the most
eminent painter; its only deformity are its ears, which are long; hence
it is called by the Portuguese the wild ass, though wrongly; of what
value and esteem it was appears from the large price it has been sold
for; one, that was the gift of a king to a Turkish governor, was sold to
an Indian for 2,000 pieces of Venetian money, to make a present of to
the great Mogor, king of the Indians (e), which was the value of nine
hundred pounds. Those that rode on these creatures were the princes and
nobles of Israel; though they are generally interpreted by the Jewish
commentators of merchants that rode from place to place about business;
and these are called upon to speak of the wonderful things God had done
for Israel, in freeing them from the bondage of the Canaanites, so that
these nobles or merchants might ride about the country without any fear;
and to discourse of them to others, and in their meditations give praise
to God on account of them:

ye that sit in judgment; which seems to describe judges upon the bench,
sitting to hear and try causes, and pass righteous judgment; these are
also exhorted to give thanks to the Lord, that they were now restored to
their seats of judgment, from which they were driven; or where they
could not peaceably exercise their office, which they now might and did:
Cocceius renders the word "on measures", as if these were persons that
presided over measures, and took care that they were just and right.
Though Kimchi and Ben Melech say, that Middin, which we render "in
judgment", is either the name of a city in the book of Joshua; see Gill
on [Jos 15:61](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#061.md), or the name of a way
(f) well known, in which they were afraid to go because of the enemy,
but now went in it with safety, and therefore had reason to speak well
of God, and praise his name; but this is rather intended in the next
clause:

and walk by the way; the common people that travelled from place to
place on business, who before were obliged to leave the public roads,
and go in byways, [Jdg 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006.md) but now
could travel in the common road without fear, and therefore ought to be
thankful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 5:11</span></span>

They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the place of
drawing water,.... Meaning either the army of the Israelites, delivered
from the archers of Sisera's host at the river Kishon; or such persons,
as maidens and others, that went out of the cities to fountains and
wells of water, to fetch water from thence for their necessities, but
were frightened by the noise of archers that shot at them; or shepherds
who led their flocks to water them there, but were repulsed or slain by
archers that lay in wait in woods or lurking places thereabout; but now
the country being cleared of them, they could without fear have recourse
to these places of drawing water for their flocks or other uses, which
laid them under obligation to do as directed in the next clause. The
words are by some rendered,"because of the voice of those that number
(sheep and other cattle) at the places of drawing water (g):''which now
they could do, being a time of peace; and for which the persons before
described ought to be thankful:

there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord; coming to
those places again, it would put them in mind to what hazards and
dangers they had been exposed formerly by the enemy, but now were freed
from; and this would lead them to discourse of and repeat the righteous
dealings of God in taking vengeance on their enemies and delivering them
from them:

even the righteous acts towards the inhabitants of his villages in
Israel; they being now in no danger of having their houses broke open,
and their substance plundered as before, [Jdg
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#007.md) then shall the people of the Lord
go down to the gates; either of their enemies, pursuing them unto them,
as they did, [Jdg 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#016.md) or rather to
the gates of their own cities, where they had now free egress and
regress; and those that were in the fortified cities, who had fled
thither from the villages because of the rapine of the enemy, now would
go down to the gates, and pass through them, and return to their
villages again; or else the meaning is, that the people would now
frequent as formerly the courts of judicature held in the gates of their
cities, to have justice done them, and be in no fear of being disturbed
by the enemy, as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 5:12</span></span>

Awake, awake, Deborah, awake, awake, utter a song, &c. Either perceiving
some languor and remissness in her spirits, while she was delivering
this song, and therefore arouses herself to attend to this service with
more ardour and zeal; or rather finding herself more impressed with a
sense of the great and good things the Lord had done for Israel, calls
upon her soul to exert all its powers in celebrating the praises of the
Lord, and therefore repeats the word awake so often as she does:

arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam; for
though the whole army of Sisera was destroyed, that not a man was left,
[Jdg 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#016.md) yet as Barak pursued to
Harosheth of the Gentiles, many there and in other places which fell
into his hands, that belonged to Jabin, might be taken captive by him;
and though the Canaanites were to be slain, yet they might first be led
captive in triumph; and besides, there might be some of other nations
that were taken by him in this war; see [Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018.md).

[Judges 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 5:13</span></span>

Then he made him that remaineth,.... The people of Israel that remained,
who had been under the yoke of Jabin king of Canaan, under which many of
the Israelites very probably died; but now the few mean and miserable
that remained were raised to an high estate, and made to

have dominion over the nobles among the people; that is, over the
Canaanitish nobility, that were among the people under Jabin; but he
being conquered by the Israelites, his people and even his nobles became
subject to them; and this was the Lord's doing, as the following words
show:

the Lord made me have dominion over the mighty; that is, Deborah, to
whom God gave dominion either over the mighty ones of Israel, being
raised up to be their judge; or over the mighty Canaanites, she having a
concern in the conquest of them and triumph over them, through her
direction, advice, command, and presence, though a woman.

[Judges 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 5:14</span></span>

Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek,.... In this and
some following verses, Deborah makes mention of the tribes that were
siding and assisting in this war, and of those that were not; and begins
with Ephraim, where she herself dwelt, [Jdg
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#005.md) who was the root, foundation, and
source of this expedition, that under a divine influence directed,
animated, and encouraged to it; and by whom, and from whence, a
detachment was sent against the Amalekites, who upon all occasions were
ready to assist the Canaanites, and now were about to do it; and to
prevent their junction, a party was sent from Ephraim, and by the
Ehpraimites; though the Targum, and the Jewish commentators in general,
refer this to a past action, which Deborah here commemorates and
celebrates; and understand by "root", Joshua, who was of that tribe, and
who discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword, [Exo
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#013.md).

after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; which the same Targum and the
same writers interpret of a future fact, and as spoken of by way of
prophecy; and suppose that Saul of the tribe of Benjamin is meant, and
the people of Benjamin, the two hundred thousand footmen he took with
him, and fought against Amalek, and destroyed them, [Sa1
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001.md) but it is rather to be understood
of the tribe of Benjamin in general, which at this time went out against
Amalek, to prevent their giving any assistance to Jabin king of Canaan,
and who were followed in it by a party of the Ephraimites; so that
Benjamin has the greatest honour given it, partly as it was first in
this affair, and partly as it was general, the whole tribe engaged,
whereas only a few in Ephraim, and those stimulated by the example of
Benjamin:

out of Machir came down governors; Machir was the only son of Manasseh,
and therefore this must respect that tribe, half of which was settled on
the other side Jordan, and to which Jarchi and other Jewish writers
ascribe this, and suppose it refers to the princes and great men of it,
who subdued the Amorites, and took the sixty cities of Argob in the time
of Moses; though Kimchi and Ben Gersom understand it of some of them
that came from thence to assist in this war; but it is clearly suggested
in [Jdg 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#017.md) that they abode beyond
Jordan, and gave no assistance at all; it therefore must be understood
of the half tribe of Manasseh, within Jordan, from whence came great
personages, with a number of men no doubt along with them, to lend an
helping hand against the Canaanites, or to be employed as assistants
under Barak in this expedition:

and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer; which being a
maritime tribe, and employed in trade and navigation, had many clerks
famous for their readiness in handling the pen; but these through a zeal
for the common cause dropped their pens, and took to the sword, in
vindication of the rights and liberties of themselves and their
brethren; for which they are justly commended.

And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah,.... On Mount Tabor,
whither they came to offer themselves to join in the war against Jabin;
or to assist with their counsels, the men of this tribe being
understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, [Ch1
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#032.md).

even Issachar: not the princes only, but the whole tribe also; so the
Targum paraphrases it,"the rest of the tribe of Issachar:"

and also Barak, he was sent on foot into the valley; which was at the
bottom of Mount Tabor, from whence he was sent down by Deborah, when
Sisera's army was come thither; and where he went cheerfully on foot at
the head of his 10,000 men, to engage Sisera with his horse and
chariots; and which latter were capable of doing great execution in the
valley, by running among the foot, and cutting them in pieces with the
scythes at the side of them; but Barak, fearless of danger, readily
obeyed the command of the judge and prophetess, believing it was of God:
or the words may be rendered, as by Noldius (h).

as Issachar, so Barak; he was sent, &c. the one as the other, with equal
readiness and cheerfulness, courage and intrepidity, descended the
mountain, at the order of Deborah, and took the field in the open plain,
to engage with Sisera and his numerous host:

for the division of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart; either
for their divisions among themselves in their own councils, some being
for going over Jordan to assist their brethren the Israelites against
Jabin, and free them from his yoke, pitying their distressed state and
condition; and others were for keeping at home, and taking care of their
flocks, and not intermeddle in the quarrel; judging it to be most for
their worldly peace and profit to observe a neutrality: by reason of
which divisions no assistance was given. Or for their divisions and
separations from their brethren the Israelites, from whom they were not
only separated by the river Jordan, but in their affections to them, and
regards for them; keeping at a distance from them, when their help was
required: and this conduct of theirs caused many thoughts of heart in
Deborah and Barak, in the princes and people of Israel, who could not
well understand the reason of it; and which caused much grief and
uneasiness of mind, that so powerful a tribe, and who had been assisting
to them in the conquest of the land, and lay convenient to help them,
yet should be so very indifferent to them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 5:16</span></span>

Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the
flocks?.... This tribe abounded with flocks and herds, and therefore
chose the country on the other side Jordan, as suitable for them; and
now, at this critical juncture, they judged it wisest, and their best
policy, to abide by them, and the care of them; lest by intermeddling,
should Jabin prevail, he might be provoked to fall upon them, and take
them from them; wherefore the bleatings of their flocks, and the
whistlings of the shepherds that kept them, sounded louder in their
ears, and more engrossed their attention, than the groans and cries of
Israel under oppression; or than the soundings of the trumpet, the alarm
of war, or the loud calls of Deborah and Barak; being under the
influence of a carnal worldly spirit, and wanting affection and sympathy
towards their brethren, about which Deborah here expostulates with them:

for the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart; this
is repeated to show how much the prophetess, the general of the army,
the princes and people, were affected with this conduct of the tribe of
Reuben; it gave them much pain and uneasiness, occasioned many
inquiries, caused much discourse and conversation, and put them upon
thinking, and greatly exercised their minds, what should be the meaning
of their behaving after this manner. Cocceius takes these words to be
spoken ironically, and renders them,"at the rivers of Reuben were great
men in searchings of heart;''there were wisdom, prudence, counsel,
searching, and discerning of spirits, preferring their flocks to the
people of God.

[Judges 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 5:17</span></span>

Gilead abode beyond Jordan,.... A country which lay on the other side
Jordan, and was given by Moses, half of it to the tribes of Reuben and
Gad, and the other half to the half tribe of Manasseh, [Deu
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012.md) and being here distinguished from
Reuben, it seems that not only that tribe, but also the tribe of Gad,
and the half tribe of Manasseh, on that side Jordan, came not to the
help of Israel; but abode where they were, attending their flocks and
herds, and preferring their own private profit to the public good; yet
as Gilead was given to Machir, [Deu
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#015.md) and some are said to come out
from thence to serve in this expedition, [Jdg
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014.md) some read the words, as Kimchi
observes, with an interrogation, "did Gilead abide beyond Jordan?" no,
he did not; though his situation was beyond it, as well as Reuben's, yet
he did not continue there, but came over to help his brethren; and so
this is introduced to upbraid Reuben, and leave him without excuse,
since he could as well have left his flocks as Gilead did, and come over
to the help of his brethren as well as he:

and why did Dan remain in ships? the Danites inhabiting Joppa, and other
places bordering on the Mediterranean sea, attended their navigation and
merchandise; and which they chose rather to do, than to appear in the
field of battle in the behalf of their brethren; judging this to be a
sufficient excuse, though the question put implies the contrary;
according to the Targum, they were meditating a flight, and put their
goods into ships to flee with them, should Sisera get the day:

Asher continued on the sea shore; on the shore of the Mediterranean sea,
attending traffic and business, and did not concern themselves at all in
this war:

and abode in his trenches; in his towns and cities, the walls of which
had been broken down by the Canaanites, and remained unrepaired, nor
were they suffered to repair them; and therefore excused themselves on
this account from engaging in the war, being obliged to stay at home to
keep and defend their cities; which were in such a ruinous and weak
condition, that the enemy might enter at any time: some render it, "in
their creeks" (i) bays and havens where they had much shipping, and
which required their attendance.

Zebulun and Naphtali were a people,.... These two tribes were chiefly
concerned in this war; out of them were the 10,000 men that followed
Barak, who willingly offered themselves, and were the most active and
vigorous:

that jeoparded themselves unto the death; exposed them to the utmost
danger, fearless of death itself: or reproached (k) their lives; were
careless of them, valued them not; they were not dear to them, but were
ready to part with them freely, in the cause of liberty in which they
were engaged:

in the high places of the field; on the top of Mount Tabor, where they
were mustered, and from whence they beheld the vast host of Sisera
surrounding them; and yet, with an undaunted bravery and courage,
descended the hill to fight with them. The Vulgate Latin version reads,
"in the country of Merome"; in the plains and fields of it, near which
were the waters of Merom, where Joshua fought Jabin, a former king of
Canaan, and supposed by some to be the same with Kishon here, [Jos
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#005.md).

\(k\) "probris affecit", Pagninus; so the Targum.

[Judges 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 5:19</span></span>

The kings came,.... Who were with Sisera, as the Targum adds; unless
Deborah can be thought to refer to the battle, supposed to be fought
about the same place, between Joshua and the kings in confederacy with
Jabin, [Jos 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md).

then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; the
other kings of Canaan, which came into the assistance of Jabin, either
in the times of Joshua; or rather which now joined Sisera's army, in
those places, which both belonged to Manasseh, but were in the tribe of
Issachar, of which See Gill on [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md) and were at some distance from
each other, as appears by the villages and country around, and belonging
to each; and such was the largeness of Sisera's army, reinforced by
those kings, that according to the Targum it reached from Taanach to
Megiddo; the same is observed by the Jewish commentators; the waters of
Megiddo are the same with the river Kishon, which ran near the city:

they took no gain of money; that is, either of Jabin king of Canaan,
whom they came to serve; but freely engaged with him, and maintained
their own troops, which they brought into the field, and had raised at
their own expense; but according to Kimchi the sense is, they took no
money of the Israelites that fell into their hands, but slew them, would
not save their lives, though they offered them money, being like the
merciless Medes, [Isa 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017.md) but rather
the meaning is, that whereas they came big with expectation of a large
booty among the Israelites, they were disappointed, and obliged to flee
without any.

[Judges 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 5:20</span></span>

They fought from heaven,.... Either the angels of heaven, afterwards
called stars; or the heavens, the elements, fought for Israel, and
against Sisera; a violent storm of rain and hail falling at this time,
which discomfited Sisera's army; See Gill on [Jdg
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015.md), or this victory was obtained in
such a manner as plainly showed it was not of man, but of God from
heaven; so the Targum,"from heaven war was made with them;''with the
kings before mentioned; God fought against them, and no wonder they were
conquered:

the stars in their courses fought against Sisera it seems as if it was
in the night that this battle was fought, at least that the pursuit
lasted till night, when the stars by their brightness and clear shining
favoured the Israelites, and were greatly to the disadvantage of the
Canaanites; unless it can be thought, as is by some, that the stars had
an influence to cause a tempest of rain, hail, thunder, and lightnings,
by which the army of Sisera was discomfited in the daytime, as before
observed.

[Judges 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 5:21</span></span>

The river of Kishon swept them away,.... To which Sisera's army was
drawn, and where it was discomfited; and very probably many of them, in
their confusion, endeavoured to make their escape by fording or swimming
over the river, by which they were swept away and drowned, the waters of
it at this time swelling in a miraculous manner, as Ben Gersom thinks;
or were increased by the large showers of rain that fell, as some note
from Josephus, though I find it not in him; however it is not improbable
it might be the case; for our countryman Mr. Maundrell (l) thus observed
when he was at it;"in the condition we saw it, its waters were low and
inconsiderable; but passing along the side of the plain, we discovered
the track of many lesser torrents falling down into it from the
mountains, which must needs make it swell exceedingly upon sudden rains,
as doubtless it actually did at the destruction of Sisera's host, [Jdg
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021.md)"

that ancient river, the river Kishon; called ancient, either because it
was from the beginning of the creation, and not cut by the art of men,
as some rivers are; or because it was spoken of by poets and historians
in ancient times; or because of famous exploits done here of old; so the
Targum,"the river where signs and mighty works were done for Israel of
old.''Some take the word Kedumim to be another name of the river, so
called from its windings and turnings, and, as it were, meeting itself.
So some travellers tell us (m) the river Kedumim, the same with Kishon,
is so called, because it meets itself, being by its meanders formed like
a sling or noose, as Kishon signifies; it rises at Mount Tabor, and
discharges itself into the Mediterranean sea, at the foot of Mount
Carmel; so Hillerus (n) says, Kishon signifies bending in manner of a
snare, or net, or meander, and takes it to be the same with the Pagida
of Pliny (o), which in the Greek tongue signifies the same:

O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength; a strong and mighty army,
through her prayers and supplication, advice and direction; or thou hast
trodden with strength, that is, the river Kishon, as some Jewish
interpreters understand it, who suppose that another miracle was
wrought; that as the waters of the river swelled when the Canaanites
attempted to escape over it, so it sunk and became fordable for Deborah
and the Israelites; a miracle, as they suppose, somewhat similar to that
at the Red sea.

Then were the horse hoofs broken by means of the pransings,.... Either
through the force of the waters of the river, where they pranced and
plunged, and could have no standing; or through the swift haste they
made to run away, striking the earth so quick, and with such force and
vehemence, that their hoofs were broken thereby, especially on stony
ground, and so their speed retarded:

the pransings of the mighty ones; either their riders, princes, and
great personages, who made them prance, leap, and run with great speed
and force; or horses strong and mighty, being such as were selected for
this purpose, and trained to war.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 5:23</span></span>

Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord,.... Not Barak, as the Targum
and Jarchi, but Deborah herself said this under a spirit of prophecy,
not from her own spirit in a revengeful way, but from the Spirit of God;
or this was suggested to her by an angel, not a created, but the
uncreated one, the Angel of the covenant, by whom she was inspired, and
an impulse made by him on her to denounce a curse on Meroz; which some
say was a star, Sisera's star; others the name of a mighty man (p), so
Jarchi; but rather it is some name of a city or place near where the
battle was fought, so Kimchi, Ben Gersom, and Ben Melech: some take
Meroz to be the same with Merom, at the waters of which Joshua fought
with Jabin, [Jos 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#005.md) and supposed to
be the same with the waters of Megiddo, and the river Kishon, where this
battle was fought; and Jerom (q), under the word Merom, observes, that
there was in his time a village called Merrus, twelve miles from the
city Sebaste near Dothaim, and that Meroz here is the name of a place is
clear from what follows:

curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; or "curse cursing" (r);
repeat it, give them curse upon curse, curse them most vehemently: the
reason of which follows:

because they came not to the help of the Lord; that is, of the people of
the Lord, whose cause was the Lord's; for though he stood in no need of
their help, yet their negligence and neutrality were highly resented by
him, and therefore repeated:

to the help of the Lord against the mighty; the mighty Canaanites, and
their mighty kings, and mighty hosts; or "with the mighty" (s), Barak
and his 10,000: now though others, who did not come into their
assistance, are only discommended, being at a distance, yet those are
cursed, being very near, and saw the peril their brethren were in, and
yet would not lend an helping hand.

Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,....
Under the same influence that Meroz was cursed, Jael is blessed, the one
for not helping Israel in a public way, the other for doing it in a
private manner; this blessing is pronounced, either in a way of prayer
that it might be, or in a way of prophecy that it should be, and indeed
in both:

blessed shall she be above the women in the tent; above all women that
dwell in tents: this being a proper description of a woman, whose
character it is to abide in her tent, dwell at home, and mind the
business of her family; and may have respect to the manly action she
performed in her tent, equal, if not superior, to what was done in the
field.

[Judges 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 5:25</span></span>

He asked water, and she gave him milk,.... That is, Sisera asked it of
her, as the Targum expresses it, when he turned into her tent:

she brought him fresh butter in a lordly dish; which signifies either
the same, the milk with cream on it, for that is meant by butter; or
having first taken off the cream, she gave him milk to drink, and then
brought the cream in a dish for him to eat, and thereby the more incline
him to sleep; and this she brought in a dish fit for any lord or
nobleman to eat out of; in such a polite and courteous manner did she
use him, so that he could have no suspicion of her having any ill design
against him. R. Jonah, as Kimchi notes, interprets this of a dish of the
mighty or lordly ones, of the shepherds, the principal of the flock, as
they are called in [Jer 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md), out of
which they had used to drink their milk, or eat their cream, and such an
one was likely enough to be Jael's tent; from this Hebrew word "sepel",
here used, seems to come the Latin word "simpucium" or "simpulum", used
in things sacred, and which, according to Pliny (t), was an earthen
vessel; and so some of the Rabbins, as Kimchi observes, say, this was a
new earthen vial; it is very probable it was a broad platter or dish fit
for such an use.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 5:26</span></span>

She put her hand to the nail,.... Her left hand, as the Septuagint,
Arabic, and Vulgate Latin versions express it, and as appears by what
follows; she having taken up a pin from her tent, with which it was
fastened to the ground, she clapped it to the temples of Sisera:

and her right hand to the workman's hammer; in her right hand she took a
hammer, such as carpenters, and such like workmen, make use of, and
workman like went about her business she had devised, and was determined
upon, being under a divine impulse, and so had no fear or dread upon
her:

and with the hammer she smote Sisera; not that with the hammer she
struck him on the head, and stunned him, but smote the nail she had put
to his temples and drove it into them:

she smote off his head; after she had driven the nail through his
temples, she took his sword perhaps and cut off his head, as David cut
off Goliath's, after he had slung a stone into his forehead; though as
this seems needless, nor is there any hint of it in the history of this
affair, the meaning may only be, that she struck the nail through his
head, as the Septuagint, or broke his head, as the Targum:

when she had pierced and stricken through his temples; that being the
softest and tenderest part of the head, she drove the nail quite through
them to the ground, [Jdg 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#021.md).

[Judges 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 5:27</span></span>

Perhaps at her first approach to him, and attempt to drive the nail, or
at the blow she gave, he rose up, but she had done the business so
effectually at the first stroke, that he dropped at once, and laid down
his head again:

at her feet he bowed, he fell; when she redoubled her blow:

where he bowed, there he fell down dead; and struggled and stirred no
more; thus ingloriously did this general of a vast army die. This action
is not otherwise to be justified, but by its being done through an
impulse of the Spirit of God upon her, to take away the life of an
implacable enemy of God's people; otherwise it might seem to be a breach
of hospitality towards her guest she had invited in, and of the peace
which subsisted between this general's prince and her husband; and
therefore is not to be drawn into an example where there is no
appearance of a divine warrant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 5:28</span></span>

The mother of Sisera looked out at a window,.... Which perhaps looked
towards the high road, in which she expected Sisera to return in his
chariot with his victorious army; and she was looking out for him, not
through fear of any ill that had befallen him, or suspicion of
misfortunte, but through impatience to see him in triumph return,
wreathed with laurels:

and cried through the lattice; which is but another word for a window,
which was not of glass, that being of a later invention, but made in
lattice form, in a sort of network, full of little holes to let in air
and light, and look out at; here she stood and cried with a very loud
uneasy tone; the word signifies a sort of a groaning howling noise,
discovering impatience and uneasiness; and so the Vulgate Latin and
Syriac versions render it, "she howled"; saying in a whining way:

why is his chariot so long in coming? she did not doubt at all of
victory, and concluded it would soon be obtained, and there would be
very little trouble and difficulty in getting it, and therefore wondered
his chariot was not in sight:

why tarry the wheels of his chariots? the nine hundred he took with him,
of the return of which she made no doubt, only was uneasy until they
appeared, that she might be delighted with the glory of the triumph; the
Targum is,"why are the runners hindered, who should bring me a letter of
the victories?''

[Judges 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 5:29</span></span>

Her wise ladies answered her,.... Every one in their turn endeavouring
to comfort her and make her easy. The Vulgate Latin version is,"one that
was wiser than the rest of his wives;''but they seem rather to be her
maids of honour, or ladies of her acquaintance, who were come to pay her
a visit, and share in the pleasing sight they expected to have of
Sisera:

yea, she returned answer to herself; before they could well give theirs,
she soon recollected herself what might be, and must be, the occasion of
this delay; and this, according to the Targum, she made in her wisdom,
what her great wisdom quickly suggested to her was certainly the case,
and with which she comforted and quieted herself.

[Judges 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jdg 5:30</span></span>

Have they not sped?.... Or "found" (u) the enemy, Barak and his army, or
the spoil of them? no doubt they have:

have they not divided the prey? doubtless they have, which being large,
and the captives many, has taken up much of their time to look over, and
make an equal and proper division of, and that most certainly is the
cause of the delay:

to every man a damsel or two? or "a womb or two (w)", using both
unchaste and contemptuous language (x), and pleasing themselves with the
virgins of Israel being abused by the common soldiers, which was too
frequently the case with the Heathens at gaining a victory:

to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of
needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides; suits of
clothes of different colours, such as were the works of the women of
Sidon (y), and those curiously interwoven or wrought with a needle, and
that on both sides of the silk or material of which they were made; and
so such as were of great worth and esteem, and such it was expected, and
with confidence and assurance of it, Sisera would bring with him, and
make presents of to his mother and her ladies, or which he would have
for his own wear and use, or both:

meet for the necks of them that take the spoil? the general of the army,
and the chief men to whom the spoil was brought, and then divided
suitably to the rank and quality of every soldier. Pliny (z) says, the
Phrygians first invented the art of needlework; hence the garments
wrought, and those that made them, were called after their name; but it
is certain it was known by the ancient Hebrews and Canaanites, see [Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036.md).

So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord!.... As Sisera and his army did,
and be disappointed as his mother and her ladies were; which is not only
a wish or prayer that it might be, but a prophecy that so it would be:

but let them that love him; that love the Lord superlatively and
sincerely, with all their heart and soul, and from love serve and fear
him:

be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might; in the middle of the
day, when its heat and light are the greatest, and in the summer
solstice, in the month of June, when the sun is in Cancer, as Ben Gersom
and Abarbinel observe, and it is hottest: the sense is, let the true
friends of God be as bright and as glorious, and increase in light,
lustre, and splendour, as that glorious luminary in midday, and be no
more liable to be resisted and stopped by their enemies, and as much out
of the reach of them as that is:

and the land had rest forty years; these are not the words of Deborah,
whose song ends with the last clause, but of the writer of this book;
which years, according to most, are to be reckoned from the death of
Ehud, including the twenty years' bondage under Jabin, as Ben Gersom and
Abarbinel; so that strictly speaking the rest was but twenty years; one
would think they should be reckoned from the victory obtained over Jabin
king of Canaan.
