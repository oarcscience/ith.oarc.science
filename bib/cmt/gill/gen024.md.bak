INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 24

This chapter shows Abraham's concern to get a suitable wife for his son
Isaac, for which purpose he commits the affair into the hands of his
eldest servant, and makes him swear that he will not take one from among
the Canaanites, but out of his own country, and from among his own
kindred, [Gen 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#001.md); which his servant
agreed to, after having the nature of his charge, and of the oath,
explained to him, [Gen 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#005.md); upon
which he departed to Mesopotamia, and coming to the city of Nahor, and
to a well near it, he prayed for success, and desired direction by a
token, which was granted him, [Gen
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md); and inquiring of the damsel,
who answered to the token, whose daughter she was, and whether they had
room for him and his in their house; and an agreeable answer being
returned, he gave thanks to God that had directed him, and had so far
made his journey prosperous, [Gen
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#023.md); the damsel acquainting her
parents whom and what she met with at the well, a brother of her steps
out, and invites the servant in, and makes him welcome, [Gen
24:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#028.md); but before he would eat
anything, he tells his errand he was come upon, at the instance of his
master; how, he had prayed for direction, and was heard, and for which
he had given thanks, [Gen 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#034.md); and
then treats with the relations of the damsel about her marriage to his
master's son, to which they agreed, [Gen
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#049.md); and after having blessed God,
and given his presents he brought with him to the damsel, and her
family, and ate and drank with them, was for departing the next morning,
[Gen 24:52](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#052.md); but the friends of the
damsel being desirous of her stay with them some few days, and he urgent
to be gone, the affair was referred to her, and she agreed to go with
him directly, [Gen 24:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#055.md); upon which
they dismissed her with their blessing, [Gen
24:59](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#059.md); who being met by Isaac in the
way, was received and introduced into his mother's tent, and married by
him, [Gen 24:61](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#061.md).

[Genesis 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 24:1</span></span>

And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age,.... Being now one hundred
and forty years of age, for as he was an hundred years old when Isaac
was born, and Isaac was forty years of age when he married Rebekah,
which was at this time, Abraham must be of the age mentioned, see [Gen
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#005.md),

and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things; with all kind of
blessings, with temporal and spiritual blessings; the former seems
chiefly designed here, because of what follows; God had blessed him, as
Aben Ezra observes, with long life, and riches, and honour, and
children, things desirable by men.

[Genesis 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 24:2</span></span>

And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house,.... To Eliezer
his servant, according to the Targum of Jonathan, and as is generally
thought; and who may well be called an old servant, and his oldest
servant, since he must have lived with him fifty years and upwards; one
may trace him near sixty years in Abraham's family, and it is highly
probable he lived much longer; he was his servant when he had the vision
between the pieces, [Gen 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md); and
then he was the steward of his house, and bid fair to be his heir; which
was some time before Hagar was given to Abraham; and Ishmael his son by
Hagar was fourteen years of age when Isaac was born, and he was now
forty years old, which make fifty five years, or thereabout. Bishop
Usher places the vision of the pieces in A. M. 2092, and the marriage of
Isaac in 2148, some fifty six years from each other; and so long
Eliezer, if he is the servant here meant, must have been in Abraham's
family, and how much longer cannot with certainty be said:

that ruled over all that he had; had the care and management of his
house, and the affairs of it under him; this agrees with the character
of Eliezer in [Gen 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md),

put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: as a token of his subjection
to him as a servant, and of his readiness, willingness, and fidelity to
execute any commands he should lay upon him, and in order to take an
oath, as appears by what follows; for it seems this rite was used in
swearing, and is still used in India, as Aben Ezra affirms; and some say
among the Ethiopians. The Jewish writers are pretty much of opinion that
respect is had to the covenant of circumcision, by which Abraham made
his servant to swear, which is not likely: rather respect is had to his
seed, the promised Messiah, that should spring from his thigh, by whom
the adjuration was made, as follows: though Dr. Clayton (k) thinks this
is no other than an equivalent term for approaching in an humble servile
manner, and means no more than "come near me", and I will make thee
swear; and that, as a respectable method of approach with the Egyptian,
as Herodotus (l) relates, was by bowing the body reciprocally when they
met, and saluted one another, and by carrying their hands to each
other's knee; so some such like ceremony as embracing the knee, and
putting the hand under or round the thigh, might be used by servants
when they approached their masters; but it should be observed, that this
same rite or ceremony was required of Joseph, governor of Egypt, by his
father Jacob; see [Gen 47:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#029.md).

[Genesis 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 24:3</span></span>

And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God
of earth,.... The Maker and possessor of heaven and earth, by whom
Abraham used to swear whenever he did, and by whom only men should
swear, see [Gen 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#022.md). The Targum of
Jonathan is,"I will make thee swear by the name of the Word of the Lord
God,''which strengthens the sense given of the rite before observed:

that thou wilt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the
Canaanites, among whom I dwell; these being not only idolaters, and very
wicked people, degenerated yet more and more, but were the seed of the
accursed Canaan; and who in process of time would be dispossessed of the
land, and be destroyed. Now though Isaac was forty years of age, and one
would think at an age sufficient to have chosen a wife for himself; but
as Abraham knew that he had a great respect for this servant, and would
be influenced by him in such a choice, and especially as this affair was
now about to be committed to his care, and no doubt with the consent of
Isaac, therefore he thus charges and adjures him.

[Genesis 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 24:4</span></span>

But thou shalt go unto my country,.... Not Canaan, which though his by
promise, yet not in possession, but Mesopotamia, as appears from [Gen
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md); which taken largely included
the Chaldea, see [Act 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md), the country
where Abraham was born, and from whence he came:

and to my kindred; the family of Nahor his brother, which now dwelt at
Haran in Mesopotamia, called the city of Nahor, [Gen
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md); see [Gen
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#004.md); of the increase of whose family
Abraham had heard a few years ago, [Gen
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#020.md),

and take a wife to my son Isaac; from among them, who though they were
not clear of superstition and idolatry, yet they worshipped the true God
with their "idols"; and a woman taken out of such a family, and removed
at a distance from it, it might be reasonably concluded would be brought
off of those things, and adhere to the pure and undefiled religion; and
the rather this family was chosen, not only because related to Abraham,
but because it had sprung from Shem, who was blessed of God, and whose
God the Lord was; nearness of kin was no objection and hinderance to
such a marriage, the laws relating to marriage not being given till the
time of Moses.

[Genesis 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 24:5</span></span>

And the servant said unto him,.... Before he would take the oath, being
cautious of it, and desirous of knowing how far it reached, and what it
would or would not oblige him to, which was prudently done:

peradventure the woman will not be to follow me into this land;
supposing this should be the case, as it is not unlikely that the woman
would object to coming along with him to the land of Canaan, and insist
upon Isaac's coming into her country, and dwelling there, what must then
be done?

must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
that is, must I agree with the woman on these terms, and promise that
Isaac shall come and dwell with her in Mesopotamia? Now there was good
reason for the servant's putting this question, since he was neither
ignorant of the call of Abraham out of that laud, no more to return to
it, nor of the promise of the land of Canaan to him and his posterity:
and as for bringing Isaac "again", where he never had been in person,
this may be accounted for by his being in the loins of Abraham when he
was there, and came from thence, as Levi is said to be in his loins when
he paid tithes to Melchizedek, and to pay them in him, [Heb
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#009.md); and in like manner he might be
said to be brought again, or return to Abraham's country, should he ever
go there, as all the seed of Abraham are said in the fourth generation
to come to Canaan again, though they had none of them been in person
there before, [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md); besides, as
Drusius observes, to bring again, or return, signifies sometimes only to
bring on, or to go to some certain place, see [Rut
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#010.md); however, the justness of the
expression is confirmed by Abraham's answer in the next words.

[Genesis 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 24:6</span></span>

And Abraham said unto him,.... Not blaming him for putting such a
question, nor charging him with impertinence, but plainly seeing the
propriety of it: and in order to clear up this matter to him, gives the
following instructions:

beware thou, that thou bring not my son thither again; for the command
to come out of the land of Chaldea, never to return more, and to come
into the land of Canaan, and there abide, respected both Abraham and his
posterity; and besides, it was dangerous for Isaac to go into a family,
where, though there was some knowledge of the true God, yet there was
much superstition and idolatry in it, as appears by various hints in the
sequel of this history, lest he should be corrupted, and degenerate from
the true religion.

[Genesis 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 24:7</span></span>

The Lord God of heaven, which took from my father's house, and from the
land of my kindred,.... Jarchi distinguishes between his father's house,
and the land of his kindred; the former he takes to be Haran, in which
he seems to be right; for his father and his family came with him from
Ur of the Chaldees to Haran, and there stayed, from whence Abraham was
taken and separated from them; by the latter he understands Ur of the
Chaldees, interpreting the phrase of the land in which he was born, as
Onkelos and Jonathan, and the Septuagint version render it: but the same
is meant as before, for Haran was the land of his kindred, where Terah
his father died, and Nahor his brother and family lived; from whence he
was taken and removed into the land of Canaan, by the call, direction,
and providence of the Lord God, who made the heavens, and dwells
therein:

which spake unto me, and that swore unto me; made a promise to him, and
confirmed it with an oath, [Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md),

saying, unto thy seed will I give this land; the land of Canaan; and
therefore his son, in whom his seed was to be called, must not be
removed from hence, and settled in another country:

he shall send his angel before thee; Aben Ezra takes this to be a prayer
or wish, "may he send his angel before thee"; for if it was a prophecy,
he adds, why did he say "if the woman will not be willing?" but from
[Gen 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md); and from what follows,
that the servant should take a wife to his son from thence, and the
encouragement he had for his faith in it, and from what God bad done for
him, and said unto him, it seems as if he was fully assured in his own
mind of the event: this angel may be either understood of a created
angel, such being frequently made use of in the affairs of Providence,
directing and succeeding men, or of the uncreated Angel, the Son of God,
since the servant attributes his direction and success wholly to the
Lord.

[Genesis 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 24:8</span></span>

And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee,.... Or "but" if
(m), which is said by Abraham, not as doubting she would be willing, of
which he was satisfied, being persuaded that that God that had made him
willing to leave his own country, and his father's house, would make her
willing to do the like, and come and settle with his son in the land
that God had given him; but this, and what follows, he said to make the
mind of his servant easy, who had some doubt about it, or however was
desirous of knowing how he must act should that be the case; and what it
was he was to take an oath to do, and how far, and how far not, that
would oblige him:

then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; which he enjoined his
servant to take; the sense is, when he had done all he could to get the
consent of the damsel, and her friends, to go with him and marry his
master's son; and after all she could not be prevailed upon to come with
him, then he was free from his oath, having done all that that obliged
him to, and he not attempting to take one from any other quarter:

only bring not my son thither again; neither agree with the damsel and
her parents, that he shall come to them, nor persuade him to comply with
such terms.

And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master,....
Or "then" or "therefore the servant", &c. (n) being satisfied of the
nature and extent of his oath, and thoroughly understanding how he was
to act upon it, readily took it by using this rite; see Gill on [Gen
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#002.md),

and sware to him concerning that matter; of taking a wife to his son,
engaging to do everything he had directed and enjoined him relative to
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 24:10</span></span>

And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master,

and departed,.... Camels were much in use in the eastern countries;
where, as Pliny (o) says, they were brought up among their herds of
cattle, and their riches much consisted in them. Arabia abounded with
them; Job had three thousand of them, [Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003.md); how many Abraham had is not said,
only ten of them his servant took, being sufficient for his present
purpose, and which he took with his master's leave, and by his order.
These creatures are very strong and fit for carrying great burdens, even
a thousand pound weight, as is affirmed; and for riding, especially such
as have two humps on their backs, for some have but one; and for long
journeys, being very swift, and will travel without water many days, and
so very proper to take on such journeys in hot and desert countries; see
Gill on [Lev 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#004.md),

for all the goods of his master were in his hand; which agrees with what
is before said, that he was the steward of his house, and ruled over all
that he had; this in our version, and others, is put in a parenthesis,
and given as a reason why the servant took, as it may seem of himself,
so many camels as he did, and then set forward on his journey: though it
may be rendered, "and of all the goods of his master in his hand"; that
is, he took some of the choicest and most valuable things his master
had, and carried them along with him as presents to the damsel and her
friends; to which sense the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions
interpret the words, as well as some others, and which may receive
confirmation from [Gen 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022.md), Jarchi
thinks that Abraham's servant carried a schedule of all his master's
goods and substance, which he had under his hand given to his son,
whereby it would appear how rich he was, and how good a match Isaac
would be to the woman, and which might the more incline her and her
friends to listen to the proposal. Other Jewish writers (p) say, it was
his testament or will that he carried:

and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia; or Aram Naharaim, Syria of the
rivers, which lay between the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates, called
therefore by the Greeks Mesopotamia; the three Targums render it Aram or
Syria, which is by Euphrates:

unto the city of Nahor; this was the brother of Abraham, and his city
was Haran, whither he came, either with his father, or with Abraham, out
of Ur of the Chaldees, or followed them thither, and where he and his
family stayed and settled. From Hebron, where Abraham now was, to Haran,
is reckoned a journey of seventeen days; the distance between them,
according to Ptolemy, as Drusius observes, were eight degrees, which
make one hundred and twenty German miles; the journey Abraham's servant
took is computed to be four hundred and sixty eight miles (q).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 24:11</span></span>

And he made his camels to kneel down,.... Which these creatures are used
to do when they are loaded and unloaded, and also when they take rest,
and it was for the sake of the latter they were now made to kneel. It
seems that this is what is not natural to them, but what they are
learned to do: it is said (r),"as soon as a camel is born they tie his
four feet under his belly, put a carpet over his back, and stones upon
the borders of it, that he may not be able to rise for twenty days
together; thus they teach him the habit of bending his knees to rest
himself, or when he is to be loaded or unloaded.''This was done

without the city; the city of Nahor, Haran, near to which the servant
was now come: and it was

by a well of water: which place was chosen for the refreshment of his
camels, as well as of himself and his men. Rauwolff (s) says, that near
Haran, now called Orpha,"there is a plentiful well still to this day
(1575), called Abraham's well, the water of which hath a more whitish
troubledness than others. I have (says he) drank of it several times,
out of the conduit that runs from thence into the middle the great camp,
and it hath a peculiar pleasantness, and a pleasant sweetness in its
taste.''The time of Abraham's servant coming hither was

at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw
water; which was the custom for women to do, for the necessary uses of
their families; as it was especially in the eastern countries: and the
Arabian women to this time, after they have been hard at work all day,
weaving, or grinding, or making bread, at evening they set out with a
pitcher or a goat's skin, and, tying their sucking children behind them,
trudge it in this manner two or three miles to fetch water (t).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 24:12</span></span>

And he said, O Lord God of my master Abraham,.... He does not call the
Lord his God, though no doubt he was, since he appears throughout the
whole to be a good man; but the God of Abraham, because God had often
manifested and renewed his covenant with Abraham in an eminent manner,
and had bestowed many favours upon him, and admitted him to much
nearness and communion with him; and it was not on his own account, but
on his master's business he now was:

I pray thee, send me good speed this day; or "cause something to happen
before me this day" (u); some extraordinary event, which depends not
upon the will, or skill, or contrivance of men, but upon the pleasure of
God; and which, with respect to second causes, men call hap or chance,
but with respect to God, is according to his determinate counsel and
will. The Targum of Jonathan is,"prepare now a decent wife before me
this day.''But the servant's meaning is, that something might turn up in
providence that would lead on to such an event:

and shew kindness unto my master Abraham; which he would be ready to
acknowledge as a favour, an instance of kindness and mercy, and not
merit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 24:13</span></span>

Behold, I stand here by the well of water,.... Wishing, hoping, and
expecting that something would turn out that would direct and instruct
what further to do, and that would lead on to the business he came
about:

and the daughters of the men of the city came out to draw water; which
was the usual custom in those parts about that time. So Homer speaks (w)
of meeting a girl before the city drawing or fetching water. And this
was a principal reason why Abraham's servant stopped at the well, not
only to refresh himself, his men, and his cattle, but in hopes he should
meet with the damsel there he was come for; or at least should hear of
her, or meet with some one or another that would direct him to her; or
something would fall out there that would be a means in Providence of
bringing about what he was sent to do.

And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,

let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink,.... The pitcher of
water she should have upon her shoulder, after she had drawn it out of
the well:

and she shall say, drink, and I will give thy camels drink also; not
only very readily and courteously invite him to drink himself but also
propose to draw water for his camels too:

let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; to
be his wife; he desired this might be the token by which he might know
who the person was God had appointed, and whom he approved of as a
proper wife for Isaac, and whom he pointed at in his Providence most
clearly to be the person he had designed for him; and this was a very
agreeable sign and token; for hereby he would know that she was a
careful and industrious person, willing to set her hand to business when
necessary; that she was humane and courteous to strangers; humble and
condescending, and willing to do the meanest offices for the good of
others; and such a wife as this he sought for, and knew would be a good
one, and greatly acceptable to his master and to his son:

and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness to my master; by
directing to so good a wife for his son, and prospering the journey of
his servant according to his wishes.

And it came to pass, before he had done speaking,.... In his heart, [Gen
24:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#045.md); for his prayer was mental;
while the last words were dropping from him, that very moment, as the
Targum of Jonathan; so soon were his prayers heard and answered, [Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024.md),

that behold Rebekah came out; out of Haran, the city of Nahor:

who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's
brother; a daughter of Bethuel, which Bethuel was the eighth and last
son of Milcah, and who was the daughter of Haran and the wife of Nahor,
both brothers to Abraham: this is the genealogy of Rebekah, and for the
sake of her is the account of Nahor's family given, [Gen
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#020.md),

with her pitcher upon her shoulder; to fetch water from the well for the
use of the family; which, though the daughter of a wealthy person, she
did not disdain to do; an instance of diligence and humility this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 24:16</span></span>

And the damsel was very fair to look upon,.... Of a good countenance and
beautiful aspect: a virgin:

neither had any man known her; not only was reckoned a virgin, but was
really one, pure and incorrupt:

and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher, and came up; by
which it appears the well lay low, there was a descent unto it, and an
ascent from it. Rebekah was very diligent and speedy in doing her work,
she did not stay to look at strangers, or hold an idle conversation with
other damsels that came thither on the same account; but, having filled
her pitcher, was making the best of her way home.

And the servant ran to meet her,.... He did not stop her as she went to
the well, but stayed till she had been there and filled her pitcher, and
then he made all the haste he could to meet her, in order to have the
sign and token answered he had requested, which could not be done until
she returned:

and said, let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher; or
taste a little of it, as the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan; or suffer
me to swallow a little of it; for it was not so much to quench his
thirst that he asked for this, for he could have got, and perhaps had
had water out of the well before this time, or however could easily have
supplied himself; but this was done to try whether she was the person,
and whether her conduct and carriage would answer the token. Josephus
(x) says, he asked other virgins and they refused him, for which
churlishness Rebekah rebuked them, and gave him water liberally.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 24:18</span></span>

And she said, drink, my lord,.... Signifying at once that he was welcome
to drink what he would, giving him a very honourable title, observing
that he had a pretty large retinue with him of men and camels; so that
she took him for some considerable personage:

and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand; from off her
shoulder, and let it rest upon her hand or arm:

and gave him drink; let him drink what he would of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 24:19</span></span>

And when she had done giving him drink,.... Whatever he pleased to have:

she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done
drinking; she proposed to go back to the well, and did, and fill her
pitcher, and repeat it as often as was necessary, until the camels had
enough; and this now was the sign or token the servant had desired might
be, by which he would know who was the person intended for the wife of
his master's son; and this was granted him, which shows that it was not
a rash and ill thing which he asked, but what was agreeable to the will
of God, and to which he was directed by an impulse of his.

[Genesis 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 24:20</span></span>

And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough,.... The place
out of which cattle drank water, being put there for that purpose, which
was of wood or of stones made hollow; into this Rebekah poured out what
was left in her pitcher after the servant had drank:

and ran again to the well to draw water; and which must be repeated
several times to have enough for all the camels, for it follows:

and drew for all his camels; and there were ten of them; and these,
being thirsty after so long a journey, required a great deal of water to
satisfy them; therefore Rebekah must take a vast deal of pains and
labour to draw water for them all until they had enough.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 24:21</span></span>

And the man wondering at her,.... At her affability and courteousness to
a stranger; at her humility and condescension to take upon her such a
service; at her readiness, diligence, and laboriousness in it; and the
quick dispatch she made; and at her expressions and conduct being so
exactly agreeable to the token he desired to have; and at the providence
of God in bringing him to this place so seasonably; and at the damsel,
that she should come just at this time, and every way answer his
expectations and desires:

held his peace, to wit; or to know, to think and consider further with
himself:

whether, or "if"

the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not; or if not; he was
musing and saying within himself, surely God had made his journey
prosperous; or if not, how was it that such strange surprising
circumstances should occur? or what else must be done by him? or what
methods must be taken for the future.

[Genesis 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 24:22</span></span>

And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking,.... Having had
enough to abate their thirst and satisfy them, by means of Rebekah's
drawing water for them:

that the man took a golden earring; out of his pocket, or out of a box
or parcel that was upon the camels; it is in the margin of our Bibles,
"a jewel for the forehead"; or, as some render it, a "nose jewel" (y);
and so in [Gen 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#047.md), "an earring upon
her face", or "nose"; and this was a jewel that hung from the forehead
upon a lace or ribbon between the eyes down upon the nose; and such the
daughters of Sion wore in later times, [Isa
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021.md); see [Eze
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#012.md); and nose jewels are still in
use with the Levant Arabs, as Dr. Shaw (z) relates. Rauwolff (a), who
travelled through Mesopotamia and the parts adjacent in 1574, says of
the women in those parts that are of greater substance, and have a mind
to be richer and finer in their dress, that they wear silver and gold
rings in one of their nostrils, wherein are set garnets, turquoise,
rubies, and pearls: and in Egypt they wear nose jewels (b) and small
gold rings in their right nostrils, with a piece of coral set in them
(c) and this earring or jewel was

of half a shekel weight; which was eighty barley corns, for a whole
shekel weighed one hundred and sixty. The Targum of Jonathan is,"the
weight of a drachma, which was the half of a didrachma or common
shekel:"

and two bracelets for her hands, of ten shekels weight of gold; a shekel
of gold, according to Calmet (d), was worth eighteen shillings and three
pence of English money, so that ten of them amount to nine pounds two
shillings and six pence; according to Waserus (e), these made twenty
Hungarian pieces of gold, which were worth upwards of ninety pounds of
Swiss money. A handsome present this was, and suitable to a virgin.
Jarchi and Jonathan allegorize the two bracelets of the two tables of
the law, and the ten shekels of the ten commands on them.

And said,.... After he had given her the earring and the bracelets, he
put the following question, according to Jarchi, and so our version
seems to intimate the same; but, as it is related in [Gen
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#047.md); the question was put before
those were given, therefore some render the words, "and he had said",
or, "and after he had said" (f), namely, what follows; though, as
Schmidt observes, the matter is easily reconciled, and both accounts
stand clear and plain, if it be only remarked, that he took out the
earring and bracelets before he put the question, but it was after it
that he gave her them, or put them upon her:

whose daughter art thou? the reason of this question is, because by her
answer to it he would know whether she was of the family related to
Abraham or not; from whom only, according to his oath, he was to take a
wife for Isaac, and which would in a good measure satisfy him as to what
he had been musing about, whether the Lord had made his journey
prosperous or not:

tell me, I pray thee, is there room in thy father's house for us to
lodge in? by her answer to this he would know whether her family was
wealthy, and so fit to be in connection with his master's; and besides,
if she appeared to be the person he hoped she was, he was desirous of
lodging in her father's house, that he might have the better opportunity
of managing the affair he was come about.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 24:24</span></span>

And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
Milcah,.... Which Milcah was the daughter of Haran, Abraham's elder
brother, and, as thought by many, sister to Sarah, Abraham's wife, see
[Gen 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#029.md),

which she bare unto Nahor; Abraham's brother; so that her father was
Nahor's son, not by his concubine Reumah, but by his lawful wife Milcah,
which sets Rebekah's descent in a true light, see [Gen
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#020.md); whether she told her own name
is not certain, it may be, since the servant bade it, [Gen

She said moreover unto him,.... In answer to the second question:

we have both straw and provender enough; for the camels, straw for their
litter, and provender for their food, as hay, barley, &c.

and room to lodge in; for him and his men; this she could venture to
say, and invite him to come and take up his quarters in her father's
house, without going home to relate the question put to her, and to have
leave to give the invitation, knowing full well the generosity,
liberality, and hospitable spirit of her father.

And the man bowed down his head,.... To show what a deep sense he had of
the divine goodness, and in humble acknowledgment of the favours he had
received in being thus providentially directed:

and worshipped the Lord; gave thanks unto him, that he had thus far
prospered him, hoping and believing that things were in good
forwardness, according to his master's mind and will.

And he said, blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham,.... See Gill
on [Gen 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#012.md),

who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and truth; or hath
not withdrawn his mercy, grace and goodness, truth and faithfulness; for
his loving kindness he does not take away from his people, nor suffer
his faithfulness to fail; his mercy and grace in making kind and
gracious promises continue, and his truth in performing them sooner or
later appear, and both in this case; as Abraham believed in the grace
and goodness of God, that he would send his angel and direct his
servant, and make his way prosperous, here was now an appearance of his
truth and faithfulness, in making good the promise or prophecy on which
Abraham's faith was built, see [Gen
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#007.md),

I being in the way; by the way of the well; in the right way, as Jarchi,
in which he was directed; in the way of his duty, following the steps of
divine Providence, and observing them. It is good to be in the way which
God directs to and prescribes, especially in religious things, where the
blessing and presence of God may be expected:

the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren: Nahor, whose
granddaughter Rebekah was, was Abraham's brother, and Bethuel her father
might be called so, as Lot was, who stood in the same relation to
Abraham as he did, [Gen 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#016.md); and,
though the servant was not as yet come to the house where they lived, he
had met with one of the family, and had got an invitation to it, and was
on his way thither and near it.

[Genesis 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 24:28</span></span>

And the damsel ran,.... Having invited him to come and lodge at her
father's house, that he might not be brought in abruptly, she ran before
to acquaint the family of what had passed:

and told them of her mother's house these things; she did not go to her
father to inform him of it; some think he was dead, as Josephus (g), but
the contrary appears from [Gen 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#050.md);
rather the reason was, because her mother had an house, a tent, or an
apartment to herself, as women in those times and places used to have,
see [Gen 24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067.md); and because daughters
are generally more free to converse with their mothers and impart things
to them than to their fathers, which may be the true reason of Rebekah's
conduct.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 24:29</span></span>

And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban,.... Perhaps he was
her only brother, or however the elder brother, the principal in the
family, her father Bethuel being old:

and Laban ran out: out of his house, and out of the city of Haran:

unto the man unto the well; this was after Rebekah had got home, and had
related to the family whom she had met with at the well, and what had
passed between them, as follows:

[Genesis 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 24:30</span></span>

And it came to pass, when he saw the earring, and bracelets upon his
sister's hands,.... From whence he concluded that he was a rich and
generous man she had met with, and might hope to receive a gift also
upon giving him an invitation to his house; or however might judge he
should be no loser by receiving him kindly and entertaining him
generously; therefore it was that he made haste, and ran to him to bring
him in; for that Laban was of a covetous disposition, appears from the
whole story of him:

and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, thus spake
the man unto me; inquiring whose daughter she was, and whether there was
any room in her father's house for him and those that were with him to
lodge in:

that he came unto the man; made haste and ran till he came to him:

and, behold, he stood by the camels at the wall; he did not follow
Rebekah, but kept still at the well, expecting somebody would come out
of the house and give him an invitation into it, upon Rebekah's
representation of him.

[Genesis 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 24:31</span></span>

And he said, come in, thou blessed of the Lord,.... Both with temporal
and spiritual blessings; he concluded he was blessed with the former by
the presents he had made to his sister, and by the men that attended
him, and the number of camels that were with him; and with the latter by
his devotion, his worshipping of God, and thankfulness to him, which
Rebekah had observed and related: some Jewish writers say (h), he
thought he was Abraham, and therefore gave him this title and this
invitation to come into the house:

wherefore standest thou without? this he said either as reproving him
that he did not follow his sister upon her invitation, or rather as
pressing him to make no more delay:

for I have prepared the house: swept it clean, or ordered it to be so,
as the word (i) signifies; had fitted and furnished it with everything
convenient for him and those with him: Jonathan and Jarchi interpret it
of purging the house from idols and strange worship, which he knew would
be offensive to Abraham, or any that belonged to him; but the former
sense is best:

and room for the camels; he had ordered the stable to be cleansed also,
and everything provided there fit for the camels; so that some time
elapsed between Rebekah's return home and Laban's coming to the well,
though no doubt everything was done with as much dispatch as possible.

And the man came into the house,.... Upon the pressing instance made
unto him; for so it may be rendered, "wherefore the man came", &c. (k).

and he ungirded his camels; took off their bridles, which hindered them
from eating, as the Targum of Jonathan and Jarchi; or loosed their girts
and took off their burdens, that they might have rest: this may be
interpreted either of the servant and of his men by his order doing
this, it being the first thing that travellers do when they come to an
inn to take care of their cattle; or rather of Laban, as what follows
must be interpreted of him:

and gave straw and provender for the camels; straw for their litter, and
provender to eat; this Laban did, or ordered to be done: the Targum of
Jonathan expresses his name, and no doubt he is intended, for who should
give these but he?

and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him: which
was usually done to strangers and travellers in those hot countries, see
[Gen 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#004.md). The Vulgate Latin version
is, "and water to wash the feet of the camels"; which, though it is
possible might be done, yet is without any foundation in the text.

And there was set meat before them to eat,.... By the order of Bethuel
or Laban, or both; or, "afterwards was set" (l); that is after care had
been taken the camels, then food being provided was set before the men
to refresh them:

but he said, I will not eat until I have told mine errand; or, "spoke my
words" (m); delivered the message he was sent with, and declared the
business he came about; which shows him to be a diligent faithful
servant, who had his master's interest at heart, and preferred it to his
necessary food:

and he said; either Bethuel or Laban, for both were present, to whom the
servant directed his discourse, [Gen
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#047.md); perhaps Laban spoke in the name
of his father, and bid him

speak on; go on with his discourse until he had said all he had to say,
signifying that they were ready to give attention to him.

And he said, I am Abraham's servant. Not Abraham himself, this
undeceived Laban, if he so thought, but a servant of his; which was
enough to introduce his discourse, his master being a near relation of
theirs, and well known to them by name, if not in person.

blessings, after enumerated, which are of God, and are here ascribed to
him, the Father, fountain, author, and giver of all such mercies:

and he is become great; in the world, and highly honoured and esteemed
among men:

and he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and
menservants and maidservants, and camels and asses; though many of them
were obtained in the diligent use of means, yet with the blessing of
God; and others were the gifts of princes to him, as of Pharaoh king of
Egypt, and Abimelech king of Gerar; yet, as it was the Lord that put it
into their hearts to be so liberal to him, they are here called his
gifts; see [Gen 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#016.md).

by name at least, being, as is generally supposed, the sister of Milcah,
Nahor's wife, and Bethuel's mother; the same

bare a son to my master when she was old; even when ninety years of age,
[Gen 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md); this is mentioned because
it was an extraordinary thing, and an instance of divine power and of
the favour of God; and this son of their old age must be very dear unto
Abraham, as it follows:

and unto him hath he given all that he hath; by his will: Jarchi says,
the servant had now the schedule of all in his hands, which he showed;
but this is mere conjecture.

prayed as follows:

And blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the

And now, if you deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me,.... The
servant directs himself to more than one, to the whole family,
especially to Laban and Bethuel; if you will do my master a kindness,
and grant him the favour he requests, that a damsel of this family may
be given for a wife to his son; and, if you are hearty and sincere in
granting this, tell me at once:

and if not, tell me: if you do not choose to gratify my master, and are
not hearty in this matter, let me know:

that I may turn to the right hand or to the left; look out elsewhere
among the daughters of some of the other sons of Nahor; for he had seven
more which Milcah bare to him besides Bethuel, as well as four others by
a concubine, [Gen 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#020.md); though some
of the Jewish writers (o) by "the right hand" understand the daughters
of Ishmael, that dwelt to the right, and by "the left hand" the
daughters of Lot, who were to the left, which is not likely: it seems to
be only a proverbial expression, that, if they did not choose to attend
to his proposal in his master's name, he must take some other method, as
he might be directed; he knew not for the present which way, whether he
should steer his course to the right or left, but some way he must take.
The Targum of Jonathan paraphrases it,"to the south or to the
north;''because when a man stands with his face to the east, the south
is on his right hand, and the north on his left.

\(o\) Bereshit Rabba, sect. 60. fol. 53. 1. Jarchi in loc.

[Genesis 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">gen 24:50</span></span>

Then Laban and Bethuel answered,.... The order of the words in the
original is, "then answered Laban and Bethuel"; the word for "answered"
is in the singular number, from whence it may be concluded, that Laban
gave the answer in the name of Bethuel, he consenting to it, who might
be an old man, and left the management of his family affairs to his son,
who, Aben Ezra thinks, excelled his father in wisdom and honour; but
Jarchi represents him as a wicked and impudent man, who took upon him to
speak before his father: but some have thought that this Bethuel was not
old Bethuel, the father of Rebekah, but young Bethuel his son, the
younger brother of Laban and Rebekah, their father Bethuel being dead,
as Josephus says, before observed; and this seems to be countenanced by
[Gen 24:59](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#059.md), where they are represented
as blessing Rebekah, and calling her their sister:

and said, the thing proceedeth from the Lord: that Rebekah should be
given to Isaac, as the Targum of Jonathan adds: this matter appears to
be according to his will and pleasure, he seems to have appointed it in
his decree, and to be bringing it about by his providence; for these
men, though they were in part idolaters yet had some good notions of the
true God, and of his government of the world, and of his ordering all
things in it according to the counsel of his will:

we cannot speak unto thee good or bad; cannot deny the request; the
thing was so plain that they had not anything to object to it.

[Genesis 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">gen 24:51</span></span>

Behold, Rebekah is before thee,.... Not only was present, but she was
delivered to him, or his request was granted:

take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife; not that they
meant he should go away directly with her; for they afterwards solicit
her stay with them some time; but they agreed that he should bare her
and conduct her to Isaac, to be taken by him for his wife:

as the Lord hath spoken; for so they understood the token given to the
servant to know her by, as the determination of God.

[Genesis 24:52](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">gen 24:52</span></span>

And it came to pass, that when Abraham's servant heard these words,....
That Laban and Bethuel said; and no doubt but the mother of Rebekah, and
she herself consented that she should be the wife of Isaac, believing it
was agreeable to the will of God:

he worshipped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth; in the most humble
manner he prostrated himself before the Lord, acknowledging his
kindness, and goodness, his faithfulness and truth, his power and his
providence in this affair.

[Genesis 24:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">gen 24:53</span></span>

And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,....
Ornaments for women, which he had brought along with him for presents,
and which were a proof of the riches of his master, and of his
generosity and liberality, who had furnished him with such a profusion
of rich things to bestow on the person that should be got for his son's
wife:

and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah; costly suits of clothes such as
in those times were given to persons at their marriage, or in order to
it; and which custom still continues among the Arabs, who, as Dr. Shaw
says (p), have the marriage contract previously made between the
parents, wherein is express mention made not only of the "saddock", as
they call that particular sum which the bridegroom settles on the bride;
but of the several changes of raiment, and the quantity of jewels, and
the number of slaves that the bride is to be attended with when she
first waits upon her husband; a gold and silver "sarmah", he says (q),
which is a thin flexible plate of gold or silver, of a triangular shape,
artfully cut through and engraven in imitation of lace; one or two sets
of earrings bracelets and shekels, a gold chain to hang over their
breasts, with half a dozen vests, some of brocades, others of rich silk,
were usually the wedding clothes of a lady of fashion. And so in
Barbary, the man buys his bride a suit of apparel, earrings, bracelets,
a chest, &c. and gives the father a considerable sum of money, according
to the qualities and circumstances of the parties (r):

and he gave also to her brother, and to her mother, precious things;
things of worth and value, which were part of the good things he brought
with him from Abraham, [Gen 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md); the
word being sometimes used for fruit, Jarchi interprets it of various
kinds of the fruits (s) of the land of Israel; but it is not likely that
these should be carried by him on so long a journey; much better Aben
Ezra understands by them honourable and costly raiment; and it is
observed by some (t), that the word in general signifies everything
valuable and excellent, as gold, silver, &c. no mention being made of
her father, only of her brother Laban, and of her mother, seems to
confirm the notion of Josephus that he was dead; or however he concerned
himself no further in this affair than to give his consent to the
marriage, and left everything else to his wife and son to take care of,
and therefore the presents are only made to them.

And they did eat and drink, he, and the men that were with him,....
Every thing being settled with respect to the affair he came about, he
then sat down at table, and ate of the provisions set before him; he and
the men that came along with him; and refreshed themselves:

and tarried all night; lodged there all night:

and they rose up in the morning; the servant and his men:

and he said, send me away to my master; either to Abraham, who was
waiting to hear what success his servant would have; or to Isaac, who
also was solicitous about the matter: the sense is, that he desired
leave to go away, and begged he might not be detained any longer, having
now done the business he came about; still showing himself a diligent
faithful servant, heartily and sincerely attached to his master's
interest, and not consulting his own ease and pleasure, which might have
been indulged by staying longer in a family, where he would have been
entertained in a sumptuous manner.

[Genesis 24:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">gen 24:55</span></span>

And her brother and her mother said,.... Here her brother Laban is set
before his mother, as above before his father, being the chief speaker
and the principal manager of business:

let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; which was but
a reasonable request; and if no more time is intended, it is much the
servant should object, and not readily agree to it; but in the margin it
is, "a full year" or "ten months"; and so Onkelos and Jonathan, and
other Jewish writers (u), who say it was customary for a virgin to have
twelve months allowed her to furnish herself with ornaments; and
therefore if a full year could not be admitted of, it is requested that
at least ten months would be granted: this by many is thought to be
unreasonable, that a servant should be desired to stay so long from his
master, and especially it would not be asked, when it was perceived he
was in such haste to be gone directly; but when it is observed that it
was the usual custom of those times for virgins espoused to continue in
their father's house a considerable time before the marriage was
consummated, and that Rebekah was going into a distant country, and very
likely she and her friends would never see each other, the motion will
not appear so very extravagant:

after that she shall go; when that time is elapsed, but cannot think of
it before.

And he said unto them, hinder me not,.... Do not detain me, let me set
forward on my journey:

seeing, the Lord hath prospered my way; succeeded him in what he came
about; and by his being succeeded so well, and so soon, it seemed to be
the mind of the Lord that he should hasten his journey homeward:

send me away, that I may go to my master; and carry him the good news of
his success, and attend his domestic affairs, over which he was set.

[Genesis 24:57](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">gen 24:57</span></span>

And they said, we will call the damsel,.... Who perhaps through modesty
had withdrawn herself to her own apartment, while the man and her
friends were discoursing on this subject:

and inquire at her mouth; what she says to it, whether willing to go
directly or not; the matter in question was referred to her, and left to
her decision.

[Genesis 24:58](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">gen 24:58</span></span>

And they called Rebekah,.... Or ordered her to be called by one of the
servants:

and said unto her, wilt thou go with this man? that is, directly; the
question was not about her marriage of Isaac, that was agreed upon, and
she had doubtless given her consent, and which she tacitly did by
accepting of the presents, but about taking the journey immediately:

and she said, I will go; the note of Jarchi is,"of myself, and even if
you are not willing,''which seems to make her answer rude, as well as
resolute; but it must be interpreted consistent with her decent and
modest behaviour, and as expressive of her agreeing to go with the man
directly, having no manner of objection on her mind to it; but on the
contrary found a strong inclination to it, and was determined on it; and
perhaps was under a divine impulse, which strongly wrought upon her, and
caused her to be so willing to leave her own people, and her father's
house.

[Genesis 24:59](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">gen 24:59</span></span>

And they sent away Rebekah their sister,.... Not in a pet or angry
humour, but with good will; they agreed she should go, and took their
leave in a very honourable and affectionate manner. This is to be
understood of her brother Laban, and of other brethren and sisters she
might have; though by the connection of the words with the preceding,
they seem to design her brother and mother, who spoke last; and probably
all her relations are meant, who call her their sister, because so
nearly related to them:

and her nurse: who had been her nurse in former times, as Aben Ezra
observes, in her infancy, for whom she had a particular affection, as is
often the case; her name was Deborah, as appears from [Gen
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#008.md),

and Abraham's servant, and his men; who were dismissed in an handsome
manner by the family.

[Genesis 24:60](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">gen 24:60</span></span>

And they blessed Rebekah,.... That is, her parents and her friends, they
wished the best and choicest of blessings might descend upon her:

and said unto her, thou art our sister; the Targum of Jonathan
is,"hitherto thou hast been our sister,''as if the relation now ceased,
having entered into another; and especially as she was going away from
them into a distant country, and might never see her more, it was as if
she was no more to them or to be enjoyed by them:

be thou the mother of thousands of millions; as she was, the Edomites
and Israelites both springing from her:

and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them; exercise
dominion and authority over their enemies: let them not only be
numerous, but powerful and victorious, as both the nations were at
times, and especially the latter; and particularly this had its
accomplishment in Christ, who sprung from her in the line of Jacob, [Mat
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#002.md); some respect seems to be had to
the promise made to Abraham, [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md); of which this family might have
knowledge from Abraham's servant, who might report not only how great
his master was, but what promises were made to him with respect to his
posterity.

[Genesis 24:61](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">gen 24:61</span></span>

And Rebekah arose, and her damsels,.... Her maids that were given her by
her parents to wait upon her, as was usual in those times and countries:

and they rode upon the camels; that Abraham's servant had brought with
him:

and followed the man; who rode before and directed the way; the sense is
only, that she went along with him:

and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way; took her under his care,
and to be the wife of his master's son, at the hands of her friends, and
then set forward on his journey.

[Genesis 24:62](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">gen 24:62</span></span>

And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi,.... The well at which
the angel met with Hagar, when she fled from her mistress, [Gen
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007.md). The Targums of Jonathan and
Jerusalem say, that Isaac came from the school of Shem the great:

for he dwelt in the south country: at Beersheba, to which Abraham, it
seems, was returned again; for that they dwelt together as yet, is clear
from his mother Sarah's tent, into which he introduced Rebekah, [Gen
24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067.md); see [Gen
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#019.md).

[Genesis 24:63](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">gen 24:63</span></span>

And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide,.... Both the
time and place were very proper for meditation: the place, "in the
field": where he might view the works of nature, and be led to the
Creator of them, and the praise of him, and where he might be alone, and
nothing to disturb his thoughts: and the time, "at evening"; after the
labour, care, and hurry of the day were over, and before repose at
night, and when the air was cool and refreshing, and everything was
assisting to, and served to compose the mind, and help thought and
contemplation. Onkelos and Jonathan render the word "to pray", and the
time and place he chose were very fit for that service; and perhaps his
thoughts in prayer might be directed to, and greatly employed in
desiring success to his father's servant in the business he was gone on
his account, and that he might safely and speedily arrive, and if so,
his prayers were quickly answered:

and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming;
which his servant had took with him in his journey, and was now
returning with them, and which Isaac knew full well.

[Genesis 24:64](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">gen 24:64</span></span>

And Rebekah lifted up her eyes,.... And looked about:

and when she saw Isaac; whom she suspected him to be, and therefore
inquired of the servant, who told her who he was:

she lighted off the camel; or "fell" (w) from it, not accidentally, or
through surprise, but willingly, and in honour to Isaac, as was
customary; for had she sat on her camel when she met him, it would not
have seemed respectful enough to him; though Jarchi thinks she did not
get off, but only bowed herself upon the camel, when she came near him.

[Genesis 24:65](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">gen 24:65</span></span>

For she had said unto the servant,.... As soon as she saw a man walking
towards them, who she thought with herself might be Isaac:

what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? for by the course
he steered, she perceived that he was coming towards them, and so
concluded it must be one of the family, and probably the person she was
to be married to; for otherwise, had he not by his look and motion
discovered that he knew the servant, and was coming towards them, she
would have took no notice of him

and the servant had said, it is my master: meaning not Abraham, but his
son, who also was his master:

therefore she took a veil, and covered herself; both out of modesty, and
as a token of subjection to him: for the veil was put on when the bride
was introduced to the bridegroom, as among the Romans (x) in later
times. The Arab women always have veils when they appear in public, so
that their faces cannot be seen; and though in the summer months they
walk abroad with less caution, yet then, upon the approach of a
stranger, they put on their veils (y).

And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. By what means he
found out the person designed for his wife, and got knowledge of her
father's house, to which he was introduced, and where he was made
welcome; and what agreement he had made with the parents and relations
of Rebekah to be his wife, whom he had brought with him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">gen 24:67</span></span>

And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent,.... The apartment in
which she dwelt when living; for women in those times and places had
separate apartments from their husbands; this was done after many other
things had passed, not here recorded; a conversation with her, an
espousal of her, and an introduction of her to Abraham, with whose
consent, no doubt, she had his wife's apartment allotted to her:

and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; consummated the marriage,
first contracted by his servant, then confirmed by himself, and now
finished:

and he loved her; as a man ought to love his wife, even as his own body,
[Eph 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028.md); and she was a person to be
beloved, being very fair, and of a goodly countenance, [Gen
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#016). The Jews say (z.md) she was but
fourteen years of age at this time:

and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death; which was three years
ago; see Gill on [Gen 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020.md); and had
made such impressions upon his spirit, that at times he was very
sorrowful, and much distressed on that account; but now being blessed
with so agreeable a yokefellow, his sorrow for his mother subsided, and
he became cheerful and comfortable.
