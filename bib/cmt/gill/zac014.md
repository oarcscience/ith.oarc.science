INTRODUCTION TO ZECHARIAH 14

This chapter treats of the coming of Christ with all his saints, and his
personal appearance among them; and of the signs of the times before
that; and of what shall befall the enemies of the church, both open and
secret; and of the happy state and condition of the church itself. First
there will be a time of great affliction to the people of God, [Zac
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md), when the Lord will appear and
fight for them, and will appear to them, and with them, [Zac
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003.md) but before this time it will be
an uncommon season, neither day nor night; at the close of which, light
will break forth, [Zac 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006.md) the Gospel
will be spread far and near, attended with the Spirit and grace of God
in great plenty, [Zac 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md) which will
bring on the spiritual reign of Christ over all the earth, [Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009.md) particularly the land of Judea,
and the city of Jerusalem, shall be inhabited by men with safety, [Zac
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md) and all those that oppose and
fight against the Lord's people shall be destroyed, partly by an
immediate plague from the Lord upon them, and partly by the hands of one
another, and also by the saints of the most High; and the plague shall
not only be upon their persons, but upon their cattle likewise, [Zac
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012.md) and as for those that profess
the Christian name, and yet neglect or refuse to worship the Lord in a
spiritual and evangelical manner, there shall be no rain upon them, [Zac
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017.md) and as for the church and people
of God, there shall be universal holiness among them, and not a single
Canaanite to be found in the midst of them, [Zac
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md).

[Zechariah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 14:1</span></span>

Behold, the day of the Lord cometh,.... Or the day when the Lord will
come, both in his spiritual and personal reign; for this is not to be
understood of his first coming in the flesh, at which time none of the
things after mentioned happened; nor of his coming to take vengeance on
the Jews; but rather of his coming to convert them:

and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee; not the substance
of the nations, divided by the Israelites in the midst of Jerusalem, as
the Targum and Jarchi interpret it; but the spoil of Jerusalem, when
taken by the enemy, as is after said, which should be divided by them
with great joy and triumph, in the midst of it: this refers not to the
spoil of Jerusalem by Antiochus or the Romans, but to the slaying of the
witnesses, and the triumph of their enemies over them, [Rev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007.md) or else to the spoil and prey the
Turks will come to Jerusalem for, when it shall begin the possession of
the Jews; and who perhaps at first will have some success; see [Eze
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#012.md).

[Zechariah 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 14:2</span></span>

For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle,.... Meaning
not the Romans, in the time of Vespasian, for they were not all nations;
nor did a part of the city only go into captivity then, but the whole;
nor did any remain in it: it seems right to refer it to the gathering of
the kings of the earth to the battle of the Lord God Almighty at
Armageddon, [Rev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014.md) unless it may
be thought better to interpret it of the vast numbers, out of several
nations, the Turk will bring against Jerusalem, to dispossess the Jews
of it, by whom it will be again inhabited in the latter day; see [Eze
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#004.md) and Kimchi interprets it of the
Gog and Magog army. The Jews, in their ancient Midrashes (d), apply it
to the times of the Messiah; which is true, if understood not of the
first times of the Messiah, whose coming they vainly expect, but of the
last times of the Messiah.

And the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women
ravished, and half of the city shall go into captivity: this will be the
time when the outward court shall be given, to the Gentiles, the
Papists; the two witnesses shall be slain, and their enemies shall
rejoice and send gifts to one another, [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md) this will be a trying season, and
such a time of trouble as has not been known:

and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city; there
will be a remnant according to the election of grace; the city, the
church, shall not be wholly extinct; Christ will reserve a seed for
himself in those very worst of times, as he has always done: this cannot
refer to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, for then all the
inhabitants of the city were cut off, or carried captive, and none left;
but, if literally to be understood, must refer to what will be, when the
army of Gog shall come against it in the latter day; though these
circumstances are not mentioned in Ezekiel.

[Zechariah 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 14:3</span></span>

Then shall the Lord go forth,.... Out of his place in heaven, either in
person, or by the display of his power; that is, the Lord Jesus Christ;
whose name is called the Word of God, and is the King of kings, and Lord
of lords, described as a mighty warrior, [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md), &c.:

and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle:
the Targum adds, "at the Red Sea"; when the Lord fought for, Israel
against the Egyptians, [Exo 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#025.md) and
afterwards against the Canaanites, when they entered the land of Canaan
under Joshua: thus Christ shall judge, and make war in righteousness,
and overcome those that shall make war with him; and with the sharp
sword that goeth out of his mouth shall smite nations, and with a rod of
iron rule them, and break them to shivers, [Rev
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014.md) see also [Eze
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#021.md).

[Zechariah 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 14:4</span></span>

And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,.... Where
he often was in the days of his flesh, and from whence he ascended to
heaven, [Luk 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037.md) but here he did not
appear at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem; wherefore this must
refer to a time to come; and seeing it is certain that he will stand in
the latter day on the earth, at the time of the resurrection, and will
come down from heaven in like manner as he went up; it seems very
probable that he will descend upon that very spot of ground from whence
he ascended, [Job 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025). The Jews, (e.md)
have a notion, that, at the general resurrection of the dead, the mount
of Olives will cleave asunder, and those of their nation, who have been
buried in other countries, will be rolled through the caverns of the
earth, and come out from under that mountain. This is what they call
"gilgul hammetim", the rolling of the dead; and "gilgul hammechiloth",
the rolling through the caverns. So they say in the Targum of [Sol
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md).

"when the dead shall live, the mount of Olives shall be cleaved asunder,
and all the dead of Israel shall come out from under it; yea, even the
righteous, which die in captivity, shall pass through subterraneous
caverns, and come from under the mount of Olives.''

This is sometimes (f) represented as very painful to the righteous; but
another writer (g) removes this objection by observing, that at the time
of the rolling through the caverns of the earth, we may say that this
rolling will be of no other than of the bone "luz", out of which the
whole body will spring; so that this business of rolling will be easy
and without pain; but they are not all agreed about the thing itself:
Kimchi says (h),

"there is a division in the words of our Rabbins, concerning the dead
without the land (i.e. of Israel); some of them say that those without
the land shall come up out of their graves; and others say they shall
come out of their graves to the land of Israel by rolling, and by the
way of the caverns; but this verse [Eze
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md) proves that those without the
land shall live, as the dead of the land of Israel; for it says, "I will
open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves"; and
after that, "and I will bring you into the land of Israel".''

Which is before Jerusalem on the east; a sabbath day's journey from it,
about a mile, [Act 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012.md),

and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the
east and toward the west; and there shall be a very great valley, and
half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it
toward the south; and this valley will be made by cleaving and removing
the mountain in this manner, to hold the dead together when raised; and
this is thought by some to be the same with the valley of Jehoshaphat,
called the valley of decision, into which the Heathen, being awakened
and raised, will be brought and judged, [Joe
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 14:5</span></span>

And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains,.... To seek for
shelter and safety in them, for fear of the Lord, and the glory of his
majesty, whom every eye shall see, [Isa
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019.md),

for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal; a name of a place
not known; it may be thought to be at some considerable distance:

yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the
days of Uzziah king of Judah; two years before which Amos prophesied,
[Amo 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md) and which, according to
Josephus (i), was at the time when King Uzziah was stricken with a
leprosy for invading the priest's office; when, as he says, at a place
before the city called Eroge, half part of the mountain towards the west
was broken, and rolled half a mile towards the eastern part, and there
stood; so that the ways were stopped up to the king's gardens:

and the Lord my God shall come; the Lord Jesus Christ, who is truly God,
and the God of his people; and who will appear to be so at his second
coming, which is here meant, by raising the dead, gathering all nations
before him, and separating them; by bringing to light all secret and
hidden things; judging the whole world, and executing the sentence on
them; and particularly by taking his own people to himself:

and all the saints with thee: the Targum, and the Septuagint, Syriac,
and Arabic versions, read, "with him"; meaning either the holy angels;
so Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech; who will attend him partly for the
glory of his majesty, and partly for terror to the wicked, and also for
service; or rather glorified saints, the spirits of just men made
perfect, whom Christ will bring with him to be united to their bodies,
which will now be raised, and to be with him in the new heavens and new
earth, which will now be formed, and to be presented to him, and dwell
with him, during the thousand years.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 14:6</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day,.... Which shall precede the
coming of Christ, both his spiritual and personal reign; for what
follows will not agree with either state:

that the light shall not be clear nor dark; before the latter day glory
it will be a darkish dispensation; not "clear", as in the first times of
the Gospel, when the sun of righteousness appeared, and the shadows of
the ceremonial law were removed, and the Gospel shone out in the
ministry of Christ and his apostles; nor as at the reformation from
Popery, when the morning star was given, [Rev
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#028.md) nor as it will be in the
spiritual reign of Christ, when Zion's light will be come, and her
watchmen will see eye to eye; when the light of the moon shall be as the
light of the sun, and the light of the sun seven fold as the light of
seven days; and much less as will be in the kingdom state, when there
will be no need of the sun or moon; or in the ultimate glory, when we
shall see no more darkly through a glass, but face to face: and yet it
will not be "dark", as it was with the Jews under the legal
dispensation; and much less as with the Gentiles before the coming of
Christ; or as in the dark times of Popery; it will be a sort of a
twilight, both with respect to the light of doctrine, and of spiritual
joy, comfort, and experience; which is much our case now. Some read the
words, "there shall be no light, but cold and frost" (k); it will be a
time of great coldness and lukewarmness, with regard to divine and
spiritual things; iniquity will abound, and the love of many wax cold,
[Mat 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012.md).

[Zechariah 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 14:7</span></span>

But it shall be one day,.... A very singular, remarkable, and uncommon
one; and it will be but one day; things will not continue long in such a
position:

which shall be known to the Lord; all times and seasons are known unto
the Lord, but this will come under his special notice and observation,
and be under the direction of his special providence; it will only be
taken notice of by him, and not by others; scarce any will observe it,
or know what God is doing in it, or about to do:

not day, nor night; not clear and full day, as at noon; nor yet quite
night or dark, as at midnight; See Gill on [Zac
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006.md),

but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light; after
this day is over, which is neither clear nor dark, there will be an
evening time; things will be worse with us than they are; the sun will
be set; Christ will be withdrawn in the ministry of the word; his
witnesses will be slain and silenced; great coldness and lukewarmness
will seize upon professors; great darkness of error will spread itself
everywhere; great sleepiness and security will fall upon all the
virgins, and there will be great distress of nations; and, when it will
be feared and expected that greater darkness and distress still are
coming on, "light" will break forth; deliverance and salvation from
Popish darkness and tyranny will be wrought; the light of the Gospel
will break forth, and spread itself everywhere; the light of joy and
gladness will arise to all the saints, and it will be a time of great
spiritual peace, prosperity, and happiness. Vitringa on [Isa
60:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#020.md), interprets it there shall be no
vicissitude, or succession of day and night, but all day; at evening it
shall be light; no calamity nor sorrow; Christ the light, and sun of
righteousness, will break out in a glorious and spiritual manner.

[Zechariah 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 14:8</span></span>

And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from
Jerusalem,.... When it shall be light; and this is one of the things
which will make it so; for by "living waters" are meant the Gospel, and
the doctrines of it; compared to running "waters" for the sound of them,
which will then go into all the earth; for the swiftness in which they
shall proceed; for their rapidity and force in bearing all before them;
for the great spread of them; and for their virtue and efficacy in
cooling those who are inflamed with the fiery law; refreshing thirsty
souls; purifying the hearts and lives of sinners, and making those that
are barren fruitful: and to "living" waters, because they are the means
of quickening dead sinners, and of reviving drooping saints; and because
they serve to support and maintain a spiritual life, and nourish up unto
eternal life, and direct the way to it, as well as give the best account
of it: and these will come out of Jerusalem; which may design Jerusalem
literally, which will be rebuilt at the time of the Jews' conversion; or
mystically the church, the spiritual and heavenly Jerusalem; see [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md) reference seems to be had to the
first ministration of the Gospel, which, according to prophecy, came out
of Jerusalem, [Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md).

Half of them towards the former sea; or the eastern sea, as the Targum,
the Persian sea; and may signify that the Gospel shall be carried into
the eastern parts of the world, into Persia, Tartary, and China, and
other nations; and those great kingdoms shall become the kingdoms of
Christ:

and half of them toward the hinder sea; or the western sea, as the
Targum, the Mediterranean Sea; and may denote the progress and success
of the Gospel in the European parts of the world: and the meaning of the
whole is, that the Gospel shall be carried from east to west, and
preached all the world over, to the conversion of Jews and Gentiles,
who, some think, are designed by the two seas; when the abundance of the
sea shall be converted by it, and the forces and fulness of the Gentiles
brought in, and all Israel saved:

in summer and in winter shall it be; there will be no summer of
persecution, nor winter of coldness and indifference to hinder the
ministry of the word: the phrase denotes the constant ministry of the
word, and the duration of it; it shall be constantly preached all the
year long, and as long as summer and winter last.

[Zechariah 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 14:9</span></span>

And the Lord shall be King over all the earth,.... This refers to the
spiritual reign of Christ in the latter day; upon the success of the
Gospel everywhere, there will be great conversions in all places; Gospel
churches will be set up and ordinances administered everywhere; the
earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord; his kingdom will be
from sea to sea, from the eastern to the western one, and his dominion
will reach to the ends of the earth; Popish nations, Mahometan kingdoms,
Pagan ones, and all the kings of the earth, will become Christian, and
submit to the sceptre of Christ's kingdom:

in that day shall there be one Lord; there is but one Lord in right now,
and there is but one in fact that is owned by real Christians; and there
will be but one in the spiritual reign, among all that are called
Christians; there will be but one Lord and Head to Jews and Gentiles,
[Hos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011.md) the pope of Rome will be no
more owned as head of the church, nor any other:

and his name, one; this refers not to any particular name by which
Christ shall be called; but rather to that by which his people shall be
called; all names of distinction being now laid aside, and only that of
Christians retained; though it chiefly designs unity of doctrine,
uniformity of worship, one and the same way of administering ordinances:
it signifies that there will be one true, spiritual, uniform worship and
religion; there will be no different sentiments and principles in
religion; nor different practices and modes of worship; nor different
sects; but all agreeing in the same faith and practice, under one Lord
and King, Christ Jesus. So the Targum,

"they shall serve before the Lord with one shoulder; for his name is
firm in the world, and there is none besides it.''

This passage is referred by the ancient Jews (l) to the times of the
Messiah.

\(l\) Zohar in Deut. fol. 110. 2.

[Zechariah 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 14:10</span></span>

All the land shall be turned as a plain,.... That is, all the land of
Israel round about Jerusalem, which was encompassed with mountains, [Psa
125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002.md) but now these mountains shall
become a plain, that that may be seen; since it follows,

from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; Geba was a city in the tribe of
Benjamin, on the northern border of the land, [Jos
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017.md) and Rimmon was in the tribe of
Judah, given to Simeon on the southern part, [Jos
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md) so that from Geba to Rimmon was
the same as from Geba to Beersheba, which was in the same tribe, [Kg2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008.md) and, according to the Jewish
writers, the south of Jerusalem was a plain; wherefore the meaning seems
to be, that the whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, should be like that.
Jerom makes mention of a village called Remmon in his time, fifteen
miles to the north of Jerusalem, which cannot be the place here meant,
and yet speaks of it as in the tribe of Simeon or Judah; and afterwards
takes notice of another village called Remmus in Daroma, or the south
(m); to me it seems that Geba and Rimmon were places near one to
another, and both in the tribe of Benjamin; see [Sa1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#002.md) where the word rendered
"pomegranate" is Rimmon, and is the proper name of a place, according to
some; the same with that in [Jdg 20:47](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#047.md)
where was a rock called the rock Rimmon; and Jonathan ben Uzziel, on
[Sa1 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#002.md) renders it, "the plain of
the pomegranate"; or rather the plain of Rimmon: and the Jews make
mention in their Talmud (n) of the valley of Rimmon, where seven elders
met to intercalate the year; and here, they say, was a marble rock, in
which everyone fastened a nail, and therefore it is called the rock of
nails. Now the sense seems to be, that all the land of Israel should
become a plain, like the valley that was between Geba and Rimmon. Jarchi
interprets it of the whole world. And this will be literally true of the
new earth, in the thousand years' reign, which will be without hills
mountains, and seas, [Rev 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md). It may
be mystically understood of the spiritual reign of Christ, when the
whole world will become Christian; when Jews and Gentiles, and even the
kings of the earth, shall bow the knee to Christ, and be subject to him.

And it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place; that is,
Jerusalem, which shall appear very high, all the land round about being
a plain; and, being rebuilt, shall be inhabited on the same spot of
ground it formerly was: or the church may be meant, which in the latter
day will be greatly exalted, and will be filled with, and inhabited by,
some of all the nations of the world, [Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md),

from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate; not that called
the high gate of Benjamin, and which was near the temple, [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md) and seems to be one of its gates;
and such an one there was, which in Arabic was called "Bab Alasbat", the
gate of the tribes, where was the pool of the blood of the sacrifices;
and is said to be not far from another gate, called the gate of mercy
(o); but this is that which led out of the city, and was one of its
gates towards the land of Benjamin, from whence it had its name, and
through which Jeremiah attempted to go when he was stopped by the
captain of the ward, [Jer 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013.md) this,
according to Grotius, was on the north of Jerusalem: Mr. Fuller (p)
places it more rightly in the northeast part of it, as does Adrichomius
(q), who wrongly confounds it with the corner gate later mentioned,
which is here manifestly distinguished from it; and which mistake also
Schindler (r) gives into, and likewise Arias Montanus (s) and others.
"The first gate" is the same with "the old gate" in [Neh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#006.md).

Unto the corner gate; the gate of Benjamin, and the gate of Ephraim, are
the same, as is thought by Grotius; the distance between that gate and
the corner gate was four hundred cubits, [Kg2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md),

and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses; mention is
made of the tower of Hananeel in [Neh
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md) it was to the south of Jerusalem;
and is called in the Targum the tower of Pikkus: "the king's
winepresses" doubtless were where his vineyards were; King Solomon had a
vineyard at Baalhamon, [Sol 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011.md).
Grotius says the place where these winepresses were was at Sion, in the
inmost part of the city; and so Adrichomius (t) places them in Mount
Sion; though Kimchi speaks of them as without the city; and Jarchi makes
mention of an Agadah, or exposition, which interprets them of the great
ocean, which reaches from Jerusalem to the end of the world, the lakes
which the King of kings has made. Very probably these places lay east,
west, north, and south; and so denote the amplitude of the city, and the
largeness and extensiveness of the church of Christ, signified thereby;
see [Eze 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 14:11</span></span>

And men shall dwell in it,.... In great numbers, in much peace and
safety, and from generation to generation: Aben Ezra says, Messiah the
son of David will now come:

and there shall be no more utter destruction; no wars, nor desolations
by them, in a civil sense; there shall be no more killing, as the
Targum, [Isa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004.md) no "cherem", no
anathema, in a religious sense; in the old translation it is, "and there
shall be no more cursing"; there will be no curse in the Jerusalem
state, [Rev 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003.md) which words seem to
be taken from hence; no cursed thing, nor cursed person, or any curse or
anathema denounced against any; no Popish bulls and anathemas, nor any
other:

but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited; the inhabitants of it shall
dwell securely, without any apprehension of danger, and having no
enemies to fear; though, before this safe and happy state, there will be
many enemies; and what will become of them is shown in the following
verses.

[Zechariah 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 14:12</span></span>

And this shall be the plagues,.... This respects one or more, or all, of
the seven plagues, which will be inflicted on the antichristian states,
mentioned in [Rev 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001.md),

wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against
Jerusalem; who have been the enemies and persecutors of his church; and
with which plague or plagues they shall be utterly consumed and
destroyed:

their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet;
antichrist will be consumed with the breath of Christ's mouth; the flesh
of the whore of Rome, which is her substance, shall be eaten and
devoured by the kings of the earth; and her destruction will be in a
moment, suddenly, and at unawares, as is here suggested; see [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md),

and their eyes shall consume away in their holes; the right eye of the
idol shepherd shall be utterly dried up, and the kingdom of the beast
will be full of darkness, [Zac 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017.md),

and their tongues shall consume away in their mouth; with which
antichrist and his followers have blasphemed the name of God, his
tabernacle, and his saints; and which they will gnaw for pain, when the
plagues of God are inflicted on them, [Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005.md).

[Zechariah 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 14:13</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day,.... When the vials are pouring
out:

that a great tumult from the Lord shall be among them; the Targum
renders it, a great tumult, or noise of killing; and the Septuagint, an
ecstasy: it refers to the earthquake, and the slaughter of seven
thousand men of name, and the fright upon that, [Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013.md)

and they shall lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbour, and shall
rise up against the hand of his neighbour; there will be a revolution,
upon this tumult, in several of the antichristian states; and the kings
of them shall hate the whore, make her desolate, eat her flesh, and burn
her with fire, [Rev 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016.md) or, "his
hand shall be cut off by the hand of his neighbour" (u); see [Zac
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017.md), the power of antichrist shall
be destroyed by neighbouring Christian princes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 14:14</span></span>

And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem,.... These are the professing
people of Christ, the armies in heaven, the chosen, called, and
faithful, who will follow the Lamb, and attend him when he goes forth to
make war with the antichristian princes, and shall overcome them, [Rev
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014.md),

and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered
together, gold and silver, and apparel, in great abundance; by which are
meant the riches of the Papists, called Gentiles or Heathens, [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md) which will fall into the hands of
the followers of Christ at the time of Rome's destruction; and which are
signified by the flesh of the whore, and by the flesh of kings,
captains, and mighty men, which will then be eaten; they will be
stripped and spoiled of all their substance, [Rev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016.md).

[Zechariah 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zac 14:15</span></span>

And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and
of the ass,.... The flesh of the horse is said to be eaten, [Rev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#018.md),

and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague,
their beasts shall perish in like manner as themselves.

[Zechariah 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zac 14:16</span></span>

And it shall come to pass,.... After the plague on man and beast is
over:

that everyone that is left of all the nations which come against
Jerusalem; these are the remnant, according to the election of grace,
who will have been among the enemies of Christ and his people, but
preserved when others will be destroyed; and they will not only be
frightened at the general destruction, but will be truly converted, and
give glory to the God of heaven, [Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013.md), these

shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of
hosts; the King Messiah, as Aben Ezra and Abendana on the place observe;
the same with the King overall the earth, [Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009.md) who is Lord of hosts, of all the
armies in heaven, that will have followed him, at this time, and is to
be worshipped by angels and men; he is equal with God, the Creator of
both, the Redeemer of men, and King of saints; and to worship him shall
the above persons preserved and called go up to Jerusalem, the church of
God, year by year, that is, constantly:

and to keep the feast of tabernacles; not literally, but spiritually;
for, as all the Jewish feasts have been long since abolished, having had
their accomplishment in Christ, not one of them will ever be revived in
the latter day. This feast was originally kept in commemoration of the
Israelites dwelling in tents in the wilderness, and was typical of
Christ's incarnation, who was made flesh, and tabernacled among us; so
that to keep this feast is no other than to believe in Christ as come in
the flesh, and in the faith of this to attend to the Gospel feast of the
word and ordinances; and whereas this feast was observed by drawing
water with expressions of joy, this may respect the pouring forth of the
Spirit in the last day, and that spiritual joy saints will then be
filled with; to which may be added, that palm tree branches used to be
carried in their hands at the time of that feast; and so the keeping of
it now may denote the victory that will be obtained over the beast and
his image, which palm tree branches are a token of; and this will issue
in the personal reign of Christ, when the tabernacle of God shall be
with men.

[Zechariah 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">zac 14:17</span></span>

And it shall be, that whosoever will not come up,.... This, though it
follows upon the former account, must be understood of times preceding
the spiritual reign of Christ; for the rain of the Gospel will be upon
all the earth in the latter day glory; and all nations will then serve
and worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even those that remain after
the general destruction of the antichristian states; besides, express
mention is hereafter made of Egypt, which designs Rome, [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md) and the whole manifestly refers
to the time of the witnesses prophesying in sackcloth, who had power to
shut the heaven, that it rain not, [Rev
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#006.md),

of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem, to worship the King,
the Lord of hosts: all of the antichristian party, that refuse to
worship the Lord with his true church, according to his revealed will:

even upon them shall be no rain; not literally, but spiritually; and is
to be understood either of the love and favour of God, comparable to
rain in its original, it being owing to the will of God, and not to the
merits of men, and therefore is distinguishing and sovereign; in its
objects, persons very undeserving; in the manner of its communication,
it tarries not for the will and works of men, and comes in great
abundance; and in its effects, it softens, cools, refreshes, and makes
fruitful; and not to have this is to be hated of God: or of the
blessings of divine grace; these are from above like rain, depend on the
will of God, are free gifts, and given in abundance, and make fruitful;
the contrary to these is cursing: or of the Gospel, which is of God and
from heaven, falls according to divine direction, and softens,
refreshes, and revives; and not to have this is the sorest of judgments,
[Amo 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011.md).

[Zechariah 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zac 14:18</span></span>

And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not,.... To Jerusalem,
the church of God; do not go thither to worship the Lord, attend his
ordinances, and keep them in their purity; nor walk as becomes the
people of God: by "the family of Egypt" are meant the Papists, so called
for their tyranny, cruelty, and idolatry, [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md),

that have no rain; have not the pure word of God, and the ordinances
thereof, only the traditions of men; yea, the doctrines of devils, and
lies in hypocrisy: the allusion is to the land of Egypt, which was
watered, not so much by rain as by the overflowing of the river Nile: or
it may be rendered, "and upon them there shall be no rain" (w); or that
which is equivalent to it. So the Targum paraphrases it,

"the Nile shall not ascend unto them.''

The sense is, as they are without the pure Gospel of Christ, they shall
continue so, and be punished with, that sore judgment of a famine of
hearing the word of the Lord.

There shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord will smite the heathen
that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles; they shall have the
same plague of want of water, a famine; for it is a vulgar mistake that
there is no rain in Egypt; it rains indeed but seldom, and only in some
places, but it does rain. Monsieur Thevenot (x) says,

"it rains much at Alexandria, and Rosetta also; but at Cairo, which
stands higher, it rains less; and yet (says he) I have seen it rain very
hard every year, for two days together in the month of December.''

And Mr. Fuller (y) says that Sir William Paston, a patron of his, and a
well accomplished traveller, was

"an eye witness of much and violent rain at Grand Cairo, but such as
presaged a great mortality, which ensued, not long after.''

But it should be observed that this is only true of the lower part of
Egypt, for in the upper parts it rains not, at least not very commonly:
for Herodotus (z) reports that

"in the times of Psammenitus, the son of Amasis, king of Egypt, a very
wonderful thing happened to the Egyptians; it rained at Thebes in Egypt,
which it never had before, nor has ever since, as the Thebans say; for
it never rains in the upper part of Egypt; but then it rained at Thebes
in drops.''

Yet Mr. Norden (a), a late traveller in those parts, says he

"experienced at Meschie (a city in his travels to upper Egypt) a very
violent rain, accompanied with thunder, for the space of a whole hour;''

though in the same place he says, at Feschna, and beyond, in the upper
Egypt, the sky is always serene and clear. And in his travels from Cairo
to Girge, capital of the upper Egypt, he relates, that at a certain
place, as he went thither, they had little wind, and a great deal of
rain (b). And in another place (c) he observes, at Menie (a place in
upper Egypt) there was so thick a fog that we could perceive nothing at
thirty paces distant: wherefore, since it does rain at times in some
places, the same plague as before may be here meant; or want of
provisions, as others, through a defect of rain; or the Nile not
overflowing and watering the land, as Jarchi interprets it: but Kimchi
gives another sense, and so Aben Ezra, which is, that instead of having
no rain, which they need not and do not desire, they shall be smitten
with the plague that the Lord will smite all the nations with that fight
against Jerusalem, namely, their flesh shall consume away, &c. [Zac
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012.md).

This shall be the punishment of Egypt,.... Or "sin" (d), as in the
original text: rightly is the word rendered "punishment", as it is by
the Targum:

and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of
tabernacles; which will be one and the same; they shall have no rain, or
what answers to it; they shall all have a famine; or it will be
different, Egypt shall be punished with a consumption of their flesh,
and the other nations with want of rain: the former sense seems best.

[Zechariah 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">zac 14:20</span></span>

In that day,.... After the destruction of antichrist and all the
antichristian party, and a new state of things will take place, either
the spiritual or personal reign of Christ:

shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS TO THE LORD; as
was upon the mitre of the high priest, [Exo
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036.md) to which there seems to be an
allusion here: or, "upon the trappings of the horses" (e), as the Targum
renders it; and this intends either the horses slain in war, whose bells
or trappings should be devoted and applied to holy uses; or the horses
that carried the people up to Jerusalem to worship there, or horses in
common. The Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions render it, "on the
bridle of the horse shall be Holiness to the Lord"; that is, they should
be devoted to his service, which sometimes were very richly adorned;
yea, were of gold; as those described by Virgil (f); nay, they were
adorned with precious stones, with pearls, emeralds, and jacinths,
insomuch that the Romans were obliged to restrain this luxury by a law
(g). The conceit of some of the fathers, that this refers to one of the
nails in the cross of Christ, which Constantine put into his horse's
bridle, is justly ridiculed and exploded by most commentators. It seems
best to render the word as we do, "bells", as Kimchi and Jarchi
interpret it; since it is used of cymbals made of brass, which were to
make a sound to be heard, [Ch1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019.md)
and of the same metal were the horses' bells made; though those which
the mules at the funeral of Alexander had at each jaw were made of gold
(h); as were those Aaron had at the hem of his robe. The use of these
bells on horses, according to Gussetius (i), in the eastern countries,
where they travelled through deserts, and had no beaten track, was to
keep them together, and that they might be known where they were when
parted; and of like use are they now to horses of burden or packhorses
with us; though in common use they seem to serve to give horses a
pleasure, and quicken them in their work: but the original of them seems
to be for the training of horses for war, and therefore they hung bells
to their bridles, to use them to a noise, and to try if they could bear
a noise, and the tumult of war, so as not to throw their riders, or
expose them to danger (k); hence one that has not been tried or trained
up to anything is called by the Greeks one not used to the noise of a
bell, by a metaphor taken from horses, that have never been tried by the
sound of bells, whether they can bear the noise of war without fear (l):
and so it may signify, that these, and all the apparatus of war, all
kind of armour, should no more be made use of for such purposes, there
being now universal peace in the kingdom of Christ; wherefore these, and
the like, should be converted to sacred uses, just as swords, at the
same time, shall be beaten into ploughshares, and spears into pruning
hooks, for civil uses, [Isa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004.md) or,
since Holiness to the Lord is said to be upon them, the sense may be,
that holiness will be very general among all men; all professing people
will be righteous; it will appear in all their actions, civil as well as
religious; it will be as visible as the bells upon the horses, by their
frequent going to the house of God; their constant attendance on public
worship; their walking in the ways of the Lord, and their love to one
another.

And the pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the
altar; the "pots" in which they boiled the sacrifices shall be like "the
bowls before the altar", which held the blood of the sacrifices to be
sprinkled; either like them for number; they shall be many, like them,
as the Targum paraphrases it; or for goodness, being made of the same
metal: and the whole denotes the number, holiness, and excellency of the
saints in the latter day, who will direct all their actions to the glory
of God, whether in eating or drinking, or in whatever they do.

Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the Lord
of hosts,.... Such will be the number of sacrifices and sacrificers,
that the pots in the Lord's house will not be sufficient; wherefore
every pot, in city or country, shall be sanctified and devoted to holy
uses:

and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe
therein; this denotes, as before, the general holiness of the professors
of religion in those times; and that there will be no difference in the
vessels of the Lord's house, or any distinction of Jew and Gentile; but
they will be all spiritual worshippers, and offer up the spiritual
sacrifices of prayer and praise to the Lord:

and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the
Lord of hosts; the Targum paraphrases it,

"there shall be no more a merchant in the house of the sanctuary of the
Lord;''

in the temple, where were buyers and sellers of sheep, oxen, and doves,
for sacrifice, such as our Lord drove out; but now there shall be no
more of them, all legal sacrifices being at an end. The word here used
does signify a merchant, and is so rendered in [Hos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007) and by some here (m.md); and the
Jews (n) have a saying, that

"there are no Canaanites but merchants;''

or the word always so signifies, referring to the above places, and
having quoted [Job 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#006.md) but it is to
be applied to another sort of merchants; to false teachers, that make
merchandise of the souls of men; to all merit mongers and Papists; and
particularly to the great merchant of all, the pope of Rome, and to all
inferior merchants under him, who sell pardons, indulgences, &c. and are
called the merchants of the earth, [Rev
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md) these are the Heathen that shall
perish out of the land, and the sinners that shall be no more;
antichrist shall no longer sit in the temple of God, showing himself to
be God; nor will there be any, in the spiritual reign of Christ, that
will buy Rome's merchandise any more. Moreover, a Canaanite may design
an impure person, a hypocrite; and though there have been many such in
the church of God in all ages, yet at this time there will be few or
none, comparatively speaking; and in the personal reign of Christ there
will be no wicked men at all: in the new heavens and new earth will
dwell righteousness, or only righteous persons; all the wicked of the
earth will be destroyed before this state takes place; only raised ones,
the saints that partake of the first resurrection, will be there; they
will be all holy and righteous persons; nothing shall enter into it that
defiles or makes an abomination or a lie, only those that do the
commandments of God; nor will there be any manner of sin or wickedness
there: sin, like the Canaanites of old, continues in the saints as long
as they are in the present state; and though it has not the dominion
over them, yet is as grievous pricks and thorns unto them, and is left
in them to prove them; but in this happy state there will be no more
sin, no more this pricking brier and grieving thorn. That the word
Canaanite is here to be taken in a figurative sense is certain; for,
literally understood, there is no such person in the world now, nor has
been for many hundreds of years, even an inhabitant of Canaan, or one so
called.
