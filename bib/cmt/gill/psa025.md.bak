INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 25

A Psalm of David. This is the first of the psalms which is written in an
alphabetical order, or in which the first word of every verse begins
with the letters of the Hebrew alphabet in order, though it is not
strictly and regularly observed; the reason of this manner of writing is
not very obvious; the (r) Jews confess their ignorance of it; it may be
to engage the attention to what is said, or to assist the memory in
laying it up, and retaining it there. The occasion of the psalm seems to
be the troubles David was in on account of an unnatural rebellion raised
against him by some of his subjects, at the head of which was his own
son Absalom; he speaks of himself as in a net, and in great affliction,
distress, and trouble, by reason of his enemies, [Psa
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015.md); and as being brought to a sense
of his former sins, for which he desires pardon, [Psa
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 25:1</span></span>

Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. Either "in prayer", as the
Chaldee paraphrase adds (s); and denotes sincere, affectionate, hearty
prayer to God, a drawing nigh to him with a true heart: for unless the
heart is lifted up, the lifting up of the eyes or hands in prayer is of
no avail; see [Lam 3:41](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#041.md); or by way of
offering to the Lord, as some Jewish writers (t) interpret it; David not
only presented his body in public worship, but his soul also as a living
sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which was his reasonable service;
or else as a "depositum", which he committed into the hands of God, to
be under his care and protection; and then the sense is the same with
[Psa 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005) (u.md); the phrase is sometimes
used to express earnest and vehement desire after anything; See Gill on
[Psa 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004.md); and may here intend the
very great desire of the psalmist after communion with God; which is
elsewhere by him expressed by panting after him, and by thirsting for
him in a dry and thirsty land, [Psa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md); the desires of his soul were not
to vain things, the vanities and idols of the Gentiles, but to God only,
and to the remembrance of his name.

[Psalms 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 25:2</span></span>

O my God, I trust in thee,.... He claims his interest in God, and
expresses his faith and confidence in him, in the midst of all his
troubles; See Gill on [Psa 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001.md);

let me not be ashamed; meaning of his trust in God, by being
disappointed of the help, deliverance, and salvation from him, which he
trusted in him for; and the believer, as he has no reason to be ashamed
of God, the object of his trust; so neither of the act of his hope or
trust in him; nor shall he; for hope makes not ashamed; see [Psa
119:116](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#116.md), [Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005.md);

let not mine enemies triumph over me; either his temporal enemies, his
subjects that were risen up against him; or his spiritual enemies,
Satan, and the men of the world, who rejoice and triumph when the saints
are forsaken by God; and they are ready to say, as David's enemies did
of him, there is no help or salvation for him in God, [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md); and when they fall into their
hands, or fall by them.

[Psalms 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 25:3</span></span>

Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed,.... David not only prays for
himself, but for other saints, as it becomes the people of God to do;
for them they waited on the Lord in public worship, attended his house
and ordinances, and waited on him for the discoveries of his love, the
enjoyment of his voracious presence, and were looking for his salvation,
for the Messiah; for those the psalmist prays, that they might not be
ashamed of their expectation and hope, by the delay of those things, or
the denial them;

let them be ashamed which transgress without cause; or "act
treacherously without cause" (w); as David's subjects did, who were
risen up in rebellion against him, and acted the perfidious part,
contrary to their allegiance, and without any just reason, they not
being ruled with rigour, and oppressed; but were guided and governed by
him according to the laws of God, in the integrity of his heart, and by
the skilfulness of his hands; he being a king that reigned in
righteousness, and a prince that decreed judgment: and such are those
who are now risen up against our rightful sovereign King George (x), a
parcel of perfidious treacherous wretches; some of them who were in the
last rebellion, and obtained his father's pardon; others that have
partook yearly of his royal bounty, for the instruction of their
children; and all have enjoyed the blessings of his mild and gentle
government; and therefore are without cause his enemies: and for such we
should pray, as David did for his enemies, that they might be ashamed;
that they may fail in their attempts and designs, and be brought to
deserved punishment; see [Psa 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#004.md); or
"let transgressors be ashamed", and be empty (y); in a state of
emptiness and want; lose their wealth, honour, and credit.

[Psalms 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 25:4</span></span>

Show me thy ways, O Lord,.... Either those which the Lord himself took
and walked in; as those of creation and providence, in which he has
displayed his power, wisdom, and goodness; and which are desirable to be
known by his people, and require divine instruction and direction; and
particularly his ways of grace, mercy, and truth, and the methods he has
taken for the salvation of his people, both in eternity and in time; or
those ways which he orders and directs his people to walk in; namely,
the paths of duty, the ways of his worship and ordinances; a greater
knowledge of which good men desire to have, as well as more grace to
enable them to walk more closely and constantly in them;

teach me thy paths; a petition the same with the other, in different
words.

[Psalms 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 25:5</span></span>

Lead me in thy truth, and teach me,.... Meaning the word of God, the
Scriptures of truth; and the Gospel, which is the word of truth, and
truth itself, [Joh 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md); and the
sense is, either that God would lead him by his Spirit more and more
into all truth, as contained in his word; or that he would lead him by
it and according to it, that he might form his principles and his
conduct more agreeably to it, which is the standard and rule of faith
and practice: which leading is by teaching; and reasons urged for
granting all the above petitions follow,

for thou art the God of my salvation; who, in infinite wisdom, contrived
scheme and method of it in his Son, and by him effected it, and by his
Spirit had made application of it to him: and since the Lord had done
such great things for him, he hoped the requests he had made would be
granted: he adds,

on thee do I wait all the day; or continually, in public and in private,
attending to all the duties of religion, yet not trusting in them, but
in the Lord; and therefore he entreated he might not be ashamed of his
hope and expectation for deliverance and salvation.

[Psalms 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 25:6</span></span>

Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy loving kindnesses,.... Not
the providential mercy and kindness of God, in the care of him in his
mother's womb, at the time of his birth, in his nurture and education,
and in the preservation of him to the present time; but the special
mercy, grace, and love of God in Christ: the sense of the petition is
the same with that of [Psa 106:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004.md);
which are expressed in the plural number, because of the largeness and
abundance of it, and because of the various acts and instances of it;
the Lord is rich and plenteous in mercy, abundant in goodness; his love
is exceeding great, and numerous are the ways and methods in which it is
declared, both in eternity and in time; and though he can never forget
his love, nor the people whom he loves, for they are engraven on his
hand, and set as a seal on his heart; yet he sometimes seems, by the
conduct of his providence, as if he did not remember it, and had no
tender affection for them; and their unbelief is ready to say, the Lord
has forgotten to be gracious; and the design of such a petition as this
is to entreat a fresh discovery and application of the grace, mercy, and
loving kindness of God, and which he allows his people to put him in
remembrance of;

for they have been ever of old: meaning not only from the time of his
birth, and in after appearances of God for him, nor the favours shown to
the people of Israel in former times at the Red sea, and in the
wilderness and elsewhere, and to the patriarchs from the beginning of
the world; but the love of God from everlasting, which appears in the
choice of his people in Christ, before the foundation of the world, in
the everlasting covenant of grace made with him, and in the setting of
him up as the Mediator of it, and in putting his people into his hands,
with all grace and spiritual blessings for them before the world began;
and which love as it is from everlasting it is to everlasting, and
remains invariably the same.

[Psalms 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 25:7</span></span>

Remember not the sins of my youth,.... Original sin, in which he was
born, and the breakings forth of corrupt nature in infancy, he brought
into the world with him, together with all the youthful lusts and
vanities to which that age is addicted; and sometimes the sins of youth
are in some persons remembered by God, and punished in old age; and if
not, they are brought to remembrance through the dispensations of
Providence: and the people of God are chastised for them then, and are
ready to fear it is in a way of wrath; see [Job
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026.md); which the psalmist here
deprecates; for this is not said in order to extenuate his sins, they
being but youthful follies, imprudencies, and inadvertencies, sins
committed through ignorance, when he had not the knowledge of things he
now had; nor as if he had lived so holy a life, that there were no sins
of his to be taken notice of but what he had committed in his younger
days; but rather this is to be considered as a confession of his having
sinned from his youth upwards unto that time, as in [Jer
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#025.md); and therefore entreat, that God
would not remember his sins, so as to correct him for them in wrath and
hot displeasure; neither the sins he had formerly been guilty of, nor
those of a later date; which he next mentions;

nor my transgressions; his more notorious and glaring ones; such as
murder and adultery, in the case of Uriah and Bathsheba, and which now
stared him in the face; and on account of these, and as a chastening for
them, this unnatural rebellion of his son's, which was now raised
against him, was suffered to befall him, as had been foretold to him,
[Sa2 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011.md);

according to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, O Lord;
he pleads no merit nor goodness of his own, but casts himself upon the
mercy, grace, and goodness of God; in which he was certainly right; and
on that account prayed and hoped for deliverance from his present
troubles, and for discoveries of the pardon of his sins unto him, which
is what he means by remembering him.

[Psalms 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 25:8</span></span>

Good and upright is the Lord,.... He is essentially, originally, and
independently good of himself in his own nature, and he is
providentially good to all his creatures; and he is in a way of special
grace and mercy good to his own people: and he is "upright", just in
himself, righteous in all his ways and works, and faithful in all his
promises; and the consideration of these excellent perfections of his
encouraged the psalmist to entertain an holy confidence, that his
petitions, respecting instruction and guidance in the ways of the Lord,
[Psa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004.md); would be heard and
answered, notwithstanding his sins and transgressions;

therefore will he teach sinners in the way; such who are in sinful ways,
he will teach them by his word and Spirit the evil of their ways, and
bring them out of them, and to repentance for them; and he will teach
them his own ways, both the ways and methods of his grace, in saving
sinners by Christ, and the paths of faith and duty in which he would
have them walk; see [Psa 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 25:9</span></span>

The meek will he guide in judgment,.... Or "the miserable" (z) and
afflicted; such as see themselves to be wretched and miserable, lost and
undone; and cry out, What shall we do to be saved? and who are meek and
lowly, are humbled under a sense of their sins, are poor in spirit, and
of broken and contrite hearts; these the Lord will guide by his Spirit
into the truth, as it is in Jesus; even the great truth of salvation by
him; and in the way of his judgments, statutes, and ordinances; and will
give them a true judgment and a right discerning of things that differ;
and he will lead them on in judgment, or gently; see [Jer
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024.md); into every truth of the Gospel
by degrees, and as they are able to bear them;

and the meek will he teach his way; of justifying sinners by the
righteousness of his son; for such who are humble and confess their sins
and unworthiness, and throw themselves on the mercy of God in Christ,
are declaratively justified by the Lord, when the proud boasting
Pharisee is an abomination to him.

\(z\) "miseros", Gejerus, Michaelis.

[Psalms 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 25:10</span></span>

All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth,.... By which are meant,
not the paths in which the Lord would have his people walk; though these
are good and gracious, right and true; his commandments are not
grievous, his yoke is easy, and burden light; his ways are ways of
pleasantness, and his paths, paths of peace: but rather the paths in
which the Lord himself walks; not his paths of providence, though these
are mercy and truth to his own people; every step he takes is in a way
of goodness and kindness to them, and in truth and faithfulness to his
promises; but the ways and methods he has taken towards the spiritual
and eternal salvation of his people; as in his counsels and purposes, in
which there is a large display of his grace and mercy; in the choice of
them in Christ, as vessels of mercy, and which is of grace, and not of
works; in determining to send his Son to die for them, which springs
from the tender mercy of our God; in resolving to call them by his
grace, and to adopt them into his family, and at last to glorify them;
all which proceed from his merciful lovingkindness; and all these, his
counsels of old, are faithfulness and truth, since they can never be
frustrated, but are always accomplished; as also in his covenant, which
springs from grace, is built upon mercy, and contains the sure mercies
of David, and is ever fulfilled; the faithfulness of God is engaged to
keep it, and its promises are yea and amen in Christ: and likewise the
steps he has taken in Christ, the Mediator of the covenant, who is full
of grace and truth; "mercy" appears in the mission of him, and
redemption by him; and "truth", in fulfilling the promise of him; and
both mercy and truth meet together in him: and so they do in the various
blessings of grace which come by him; as particularly justification and
pardon of sin, in both which there is a display of grace and mercy; and
also of the truth of holiness and justice: and the mercy and truth of
God appear in these paths of his,

unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies; by which are
designed, not the covenant of works, and the precepts of the law, which
are sometimes called the testimonies of God, because they testify what
is his will that should be done: but these are broke, and not kept
perfectly by any; nor is it any favour or high privilege to be shown
this covenant and the duties of it, as is suggested of the covenant here
meant, as appears from [Psa 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md);
wherefore the covenant of grace must be intended, which is made with
Christ, and his people in him; and the "testimonies" are the promises of
it, which testify of the grace, mercy, truth, and faithfulness of Gods;
and the keeping of these is done by faith: faith lays hold on the
covenant, its blessings and promises, and claims an interest in them, as
David did, [Sa2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005.md); see [Isa
56:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#004.md); and it keeps or retains its
hold; it will not let go its hold of the covenant and its testimonies,
but asserts its interest, even when things are at the worst with it; and
it holds fast the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end; and to such
all the steps the Lord takes appear to be in mercy and truth.

[Psalms 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 25:11</span></span>

For thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity,.... Which to do is
one of the promises and blessings of the covenant. The psalmist may have
reference to his sin with Bathsheba, as Kimchi observes; since it was
foretold to him, that, on account of that sin, evil should arise to him
out of his own house, [Sa2 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011.md);
meaning that his son should rise up in rebellion against him; which was
now the case, and which, no doubt, brought afresh this sin to his mind;
and the guilt of it lay heavy upon his conscience; and therefore he
prays for an application of pardoning grace and mercy; or he may have
respect to original sin, the sin of his nature, which so easily beset
him; the loathsome disease his loins were filled with; the law in his
members warring against the law of his mind; and which a view of every
actual sin led him to the consideration and acknowledgment of, as did
that now mentioned, [Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md); or,
"iniquity" may be put for "iniquities", and the sense be, that he
desired a manifestation of the pardon of all his sins; for when God
forgives sin, he forgives all iniquities: and David here prays for
pardon in a way of mercy, and upon the foot of satisfaction; for he
prays that God would "mercifully pardon" (a), as the word signifies; or,
according to his tender mercies, blot out his transgressions, and
cleanse him from his sins; or that he would be "propitious" (b) to him;
or forgive him in a propitiatory way, or through the propitiation of
Christ, whom God had set forth in his purposes and promises to be the
propitiation for the remission of sins; and therefore he entreats this
favour "for his name's sake"; not for his own merits and good works, but
for the Lord's sake, for his mercy's sake, or for his Son's sake; see
[Isa 43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md); compared with [Eph
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032.md). The argument or reason he urges
is,

for it is great; being committed against the great God, against great
light and knowledge, and attended with very aggravating circumstances;
or "much" (c), he being guilty of many sins; his sins were great, both
as to quality and quantity: this seems to be rather a reason against
than a reason for the pardon of sin; it denotes the sense the psalmist
had of his iniquity, and his importunity for the pardon of it; just as a
person, sensible of the violence and malignity of his disease, entreats
the physician with the greater eagerness and importunity to do his
utmost for him; see [Psa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md); or the
words may be rendered, "though it is great" (d); so Aben Ezra
understands them;

"though it is so very heinous and provoking, yet since forgiveness is
with thee, and thou hast promised it in covenant, and hast proclaimed
thy name, a God gracious and merciful, pardon it;''

unless the words are to be connected, as they are by some Jewish (e)
interpreters, with the phrase "thy name's sake, for it is great"; that
is, thy name is great, and that it may appear to be so, as it is
proclaimed, forgive mine iniquity.

[Psalms 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 25:12</span></span>

What man is he that feareth the Lord? That is, how happy a man is he!
and one that fears the Lord is one that has the fear of God put into his
heart, as a blessing of the covenant of grace before spoken of; who
fears the Lord, not on account of the punishment of sin, but under the
influence of the pardon of it, and for his goodness's sake; who loves
the Lord, trusts in him, is careful not to offend him, hates sin, and
avoids it, and has a strict regard to the worship of God in all its
parts and branches, and performs it in fear; or who serves the Lord with
reverence and godly fear. The description of this man's happiness
follows in this verse and [Psa 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#012.md),

him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose; either which the man
that fears God shall choose, which is the way of truth and duty, [Psa
119:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#030.md); or the way which God
prescribes to him, and is well pleasing in his sight, who teaches to
profit, and leads in the way his people should go; and a great happiness
it is for a man to have his steps ordered by the Lord and his goings
directed by him.

[Psalms 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 25:13</span></span>

His soul shall dwell at ease,.... Or in "goodness" (f), enjoying an
affluence of good things, of spiritual blessings in Christ, in whom he
dwells by faith; and where he has peace and safety, amidst all the
troubles, afflictions, and exercises, he meets with; and where with
godliness he has contentment, which is great gain indeed; for, though he
may seem to have nothing, he possesses all things; and has all things
given him richly to enjoy, even all things pertaining to life and
godliness; and at death, when his soul is separated from his body, it
shall enter into rest, and be in perfect peace; it shall lie in
Abraham's bosom, and in the arms of Jesus, during the night of the
grave, until the resurrection morn, when the body will be raised and
united to it, and both will dwell in perfect happiness to all eternity;

and his seed shall inherit the earth; that is, those who tread in the
same steps, and fear the Lord as he does; these shall possess the good
things of this world, which is theirs, in a comfortable way, as their
Father's gift, as covenant mercies, and in love; though it may be but a
small portion that they have of them; or rather they shall inherit the
new heavens and earth, wherein will dwell only righteous persons, meek
ones, and such as fear the Lord, [Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md); and this they shall inherit for a
thousand years, and afterwards the land afar off, the better country,
the ultimate glory to all eternity.

[Psalms 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 25:14</span></span>

The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him,.... The secret of his
purposes with them; as his purpose according to election; his resolution
to redeem his chosen ones by his Son; his design to call them by his
grace; his predestination of them to the adoption of children, and
eternal life; which are the deep things of God the Spirit of God
reveals; and all which are made manifest to them in effectual calling;
and the secret of his providences is with them; some are made known to
them that fear the Lord before they come to pass; as the destruction of
Sodom and Gomorrah to Abraham, with many other instances in the Old
Testament; see [Amo 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007.md); and what is
the book of the Revelation but a revelation of the secrets of
Providence, from the time of Christ and his apostles, to the end of the
world? some they observe and take notice of while they are performing,
and see the gracious designs of God in them, for their good and his
glory; and though some of his ways of Providence are past finding out,
and his footsteps are not known as yet; hereafter his judgments will be
made manifest, and the whole scene will be opened to the saints, and be
clear to their view: the secret of his love, free grace, and favour, is
with them, which was in his heart from everlasting, and lay hid in his
thoughts, which are as much higher than ours as the heavens are higher
than the earth; and which is made manifest in regeneration, and then
shed abroad in the hearts of his people: secret communion with God is
enjoyed by those that fear him, which is what the world knows nothing
of, and the joy that results from it is what a stranger intermeddles not
with; the Lord has his chambers and secret places, into which he brings
them, and where they dwell. The secret of his Gospel is with them; and
the mysteries of it, which were kept secret since the world began; as
the mystery of a trinity of Persons in the Godhead; the union of the two
natures in Christ; the regeneration of the Spirit; the union of the
saints to Christ, and their communion with him; the calling of the
Gentiles; the resurrection of the dead; and the change of living saints;

and he will show them his covenant: the covenant of grace, which was
made with Christ for them from eternity, is made known to them in time,
when they are called by the grace of God, and made partakers of the
grace of the covenant, then the Lord reveals himself as their covenant
God and Father; shows them that his Son is their surety, Mediator,
Redeemer, and Saviour; puts his Spirit into them to implant covenant
grace in them, to seal up the blessings of it to them, and bear witness
to their interest in them, as pardon, justification, and adoption; and
to apply the exceeding great and precious promises of it to them.

[Psalms 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 25:15</span></span>

Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord,.... Not only as the God of nature
and providence, for his daily support and supply, in which sense the
eyes of all creatures wait upon him; but as his covenant God and Father,
having the eyes of his understanding opened to see and know him as such,
and the eye of his faith directed to him, to believe in him, and make
him his hope and trust; and his eye was single to him; it was to him,
and him only, that he looked; and it was constant, it was ever to him,
he set the Lord always before him; and such a look was well pleasing to
God: it may also respect the lifting up of his eyes to God in prayer for
all mercies temporal and spiritual, and his prayer was the prayer of
faith; as follows:

for he shall pluck my feet out of the net; of the corruption of nature,
and the lusts of it, as Aben Ezra interprets it; by which the saints are
sometimes ensnared and taken captive, and out of which they cannot make
their escape of themselves; but there is a deliverance from it by Jesus
Christ their Lord: or out of the temptations of Satan, called his
devices, and wiles, and the snares of the devil; and as the Lord knows
how to deliver his out of temptations, he does deliver them in his own
time; or rather out of the nets and snares laid for him by wicked men;
as by his son Absalom, Ahithophel, and others, in which his feet were as
a bird in the snare of the fowler; but he believed the net, or snare,
would be broken, and he should escape, as he did.

[Psalms 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 25:16</span></span>

Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me,.... Or "look unto me", or
"upon me" (f); which suggests that the Lord had turned himself, and hid
his face from him; and expresses a desire that he would look upon him
with a look of love and mercy, and arise to help and deliver him out of
the hands of his enemies; he pleads no merits nor works of righteousness
of his, but casts himself upon the mercy of God;

for I am desolate and afflicted; or "alone and poor" (g); not that he
was quite alone, and had none with him; for though he was obliged to
quit his palace, and the city of Jerusalem, yet he was accompanied by
his servants, and a large number of his people; and could not be poor,
in a literal sense, being king of Israel; yet he put no trust in men,
nor in riches, but wholly depended on the Lord, as if he had none with
him, nor anything to subsist with: and his case was indeed very
deplorable, and called for pity and assistance; his own son was risen up
against him, and the hearts of the men of Israel went after him; and he
was obliged to flee from the city, and leave his house and family.

[Psalms 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 25:17</span></span>

The troubles of my heart are enlarged,.... His enemies being increased,
which troubled him; the floods of ungodly men made him afraid; the
waters of affliction were come into his soul, and spread themselves, and
threatened to overwhelm him: or it may be rendered, as by some,
"troubles have enlarged my heart" (h); made him wiser, increased his
knowledge and experience; see [Psa
119:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067.md); but the former seems better to
agree with what follows;

O bring thou me out of my distresses; or "straits" (i); for the
enlargement of his troubles was the straitening of his heart; and
therefore he applies to the Lord to bring him out of his afflicted
circumstances, in which he was penned up, as in a strait place, on every
side, and which were such that he could not free himself from; but he
knew that God could deliver him.

[Psalms 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 25:18</span></span>

Look upon mine affliction and my pain,.... The "affliction" was the
rebellion of his subjects against him, at the head of which was his own
son; and the "pain" was the uneasiness of mind it gave him; or the
"labour" (k), as the word may be rendered; the toil and fatigue of body
he was exercised with, he flying from place to place; and he desires
that God would look upon all this with an eye of pity and compassion to
him, and arise to his help and deliverance; as he looked upon the
affliction of the children of Israel in Egypt, and delivered them, [Exo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007.md);

and forgive all my sins; or "lift up", "bear", or "take away" (l), as
the word signifies; sins are burdens, and they lay heavy at this time on
David's conscience, being brought to mind by the affliction he laboured
under, not only his sin with Bathsheba, but all others; and these were
on him as a heavy burden, too heavy to bear; wherefore he entreats that
the Lord would lift them off, and take them away from him, by the fresh
discoveries of pardoning grace to him. The sins of God's people are
removed from them to Christ, by his Father, on whom they have been laid
by his act of imputation; and he has bore them, and all the punishment
due unto them, and, has taken them away, and made an end of them; and
through the application of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, they
are caused to pass from the consciences of the saints, and are removed
as far from them as the east is from the west; and this is what the
psalmist here desires, and this he requests with respect to all his
sins, knowing well that, if one was left upon him, it would be an
insupportable burden to him.

[Psalms 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 25:19</span></span>

Consider mine enemies,.... Or "look" (m) upon them; but with another
kind of look; so as he looked through the pillar of fire upon the
Egyptians, and troubled them, [Exo
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024.md); with a look of wrath and
vengeance. The arguments he uses are taken both from the quantity and
quality of his enemies, their number and their nature;

for they are many; the hearts of the people of Israel, in general, being
after Absalom, [Sa2 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012.md); and so the
spiritual enemies of the Lord's people are many; their sins and
corruptions, Satan, and his principalities and powers, and the men of
this world;

and they hate me with cruel hatred; like that of Simeon and Levi, [Gen
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007.md); their hatred broke out in a
cruel manner, in acts of force and cruelty; and it was the more cruel,
inasmuch as it was without cause: and such is the hatred of Satan and
his emissaries against the faithful followers of Christ; who breathe out
cruelty, thirst after their blood, and make themselves drunk with it;
even their tender mercies are cruel, and much more their hatred.

[Psalms 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 25:20</span></span>

O keep my soul,.... Or "life" (n), which was in danger, his enemies
seeking for it; wherefore he applies to God that gave it, and who had
hitherto held him in it, to preserve it. God is the keeper of has people
in a spiritual sense; they cannot keep themselves from sin, Satan, and
the world; but he is able to keep them from falling, and therefore they
pray to him that he would keep them; and they have reason to believe
they shall be kept by his power, through faith, unto salvation;

and deliver me; as out of the hands of his present enemies, so from all
evil, from the evils of the world, from the evil one, Satan, from the
evil of sin, and out of all affliction and troubles;

let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee; See Gill on [Psa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md).

\(n\) "animam meam", i.e. "vitam meam", Gejerus.

[Psalms 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 25:21</span></span>

Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,.... Meaning either his own,
as in [Psa 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#008.md); and then the sense is,
either that God would preserve him, seeing he had acted the faithful and
upright part in the government of the people of Israel, and they had
rebelled against him without a cause; see [Psa
78:72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#072.md); or that those might be
continued with him, that he might not be led aside by the corruptions of
his heart, and the temptations of Satan, and by the provocations of his
rebellious subjects, to act a part disagreeable to his character, as a
man of integrity and uprightness; but that these remaining with him,
might be a means of keeping him in the ways of God, [Pro
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#006.md); or else the integrity and
uprightness of God are designed, which are no other than his goodness
and grace to his people, and his faithfulness in his covenant and
promises, or his lovingkindness and his truth; see [Psa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md);

for I wait on thee: in the use of means for deliverance and safety; the
Targum is, "for I trust in thy word".

[Psalms 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 25:22</span></span>

Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles. David was not only
concerned for himself, but for the whole nation of Israel, which was
involved in trouble through this unnatural rebellion of his son, and
many of his subjects; and no doubt he may have a further view to the
redemption of the church of God, the spiritual Israel, by the Messiah;
and his sense may be, that God would send the promised Redeemer and
Saviour, to redeem his people from all their iniquities; from the law,
its curses and condemnation; to ransom them out of the hands of Satan,
that is stronger than they; and to deliver them from all their enemies,
and from death itself, the last enemy, which will put an end to all
their troubles, [Isa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md).
