### [James Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO JAMES 1

In this chapter, after the inscription and salutation, the apostle
instructs the saints he writes to, how to behave under afflictions, and
in every state of life; teaches them not to impute their sins to God,
but to themselves; directs them in hearing the word, and cautions
against self-deception in religion. The inscription and salutation are
in [Jam 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md) in which the author of the
epistle is described by his name and office; and the persons it is
written to, by the tribes of Israel they belonged to, and by the
condition in which they were scattered about in the world, to whom the
apostle wishes all grace. And as they were in an afflicted state, he
begins with an exhortation to rejoice in their afflictions; because
hereby faith was tried, and that produced patience, and patience being
perfect, is the way to be complete, and want nothing, [Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md), but if any wanted wisdom, how to
behave under such exercises, he advises to apply to God for it, from
whom it may be expected, since he is the giver of it, and gives it to
all, and that liberally, and does not upbraid with the former conduct,
[Jam 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md) but then such should ask in
faith, or otherwise it cannot be thought they should receive, and
besides would justly deserve the characters of fluctuating and unstable
persons, [Jam 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006.md). And the
exhortations the apostle had given, he observes, suited all sorts of
persons, poor and rich; the one who is exalted amidst his poverty, and
the other who is mean, and frail, and mortal, amidst all his riches;
which is illustrated by the flower of the grass falling off and
perishing, [Jam 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009.md). And upon the
whole, he concludes the blessedness of the man that endures affliction
patiently, since a crown of life is promised him, and he will receive
it, [Jam 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md) and from external
temptations or afflictions, the apostle proceeds to internal ones,
temptations to sin; and denies them to be of God, and imputes them to
the lusts of men, and gives a very accurate account of the beginning,
progress, and finishing of sin by man; and observes, that to place sin
to the account of God, and not man, is a very great error, [Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md), which he proves from the pure
and holy nature of God; and from the good and perfect gifts, which all,
and only, come from him; and instances in regeneration, which is of his
will, and by his word, and is the beginning and spring of all good in
man, [Jam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md). And having mentioned
the word, as a means of that grace, he gives some rules about hearing
it; that it should be heard with eagerness, and received with meekness;
and whatsoever is contrary thereunto should be avoided; as a forwardness
to be teachers of it: wrath and anger at the doctrines of it, which do
not work the righteousness of God; and all impurity and naughtiness of
the mind, which must render it inattentive to it; and the rather all
this should be regarded, since the word is the ingrafted word, and able
to save the souls of men, [Jam 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019.md)
and particular care should be had, that what is heard is put in
practice, or otherwise it will be a self-deception; and such will be
like a man that beholds his face in a glass goes away, and forgets what
sort of a man he is; whereas, if a man looks into the glass of the
Gospel hears the word attentively, remembers what he hears, and
continues in it, he finds many blessed advantages in so doing, [Jam
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022.md) and then the apostle
distinguishes between a vain religion, and a pure one; a vain religion
is only a seeming one, and may be known to be so by a man's having no
guard upon his tongue; wherefore if he thinks himself religious, he is
mistaken and his heart deceived, [Jam
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026.md) but pure and undefiled religion,
which is so in the sight of God, shows itself in a holy life and
conversation in general, and particularly in visiting and assisting
widows and orphans in distress, [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md).

[James 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 1:1</span></span>

James, a servant of God,.... That is, of God the Father; not by creation
only, as every man is; nor merely by calling grace, as is every
regenerate person; but by office, as a preacher of the Gospel, being one
that served God in the Gospel of his Son, and was an apostle of Christ;
nor is this any sufficient objection to his being one, since others of
the apostles so style themselves:

and of the Lord Jesus Christ; the Ethiopic version reads this in
connection with the former clause, without the copulative "and", "James,
the servant of God, our Lord Jesus Christ": and so some consider the
copulative as explanative of who is meant by God, even the Lord Jesus
Christ: but it seems best to understand them as distinct; and that this
apostle was not only the servant of God the Father, but of his Son Jesus
Christ, and that in the same sense, referring to his office as an
apostle of Christ, and minister of the word:

to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad; by whom are meant
believing Jews, who were of the several tribes of Israel, and which were
in number "twelve", according to the number and names of the twelve
patriarchs, the sons of Jacob; and these were not the Christian Jews,
who were scattered abroad upon the persecution raised at the death of
Stephen, [Act 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md) but they were the
posterity of those who had been dispersed in former captivities, by the
Assyrians and others, and who remained in the several countries whither
they were carried, and never returned. The Jews say (f), that the ten
tribes will never return, and that they will have no part nor portion in
the world to come; but these the Gospel met with in their dispersion,
and by it they were effectually called and converted, and are the same
that Peter writes to, [Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md) [Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md). And thus we read of an hundred
and forty and four thousand sealed of all the tribes of Israel, [Rev
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004.md) and to these the apostle here
sends greeting; that is, his Christian salutation, wishing them all
happiness and prosperity, in soul and body, for time and eternity; and
it includes all that grace, mercy, and peace, mentioned in the usual
forms of salutation by the other apostles. The same form is used in [Act
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023.md) and since it was James that gave
the advice there, which the rest of the apostles and elders came into,
it is highly probable that the epistles sent to the Gentiles were
dictated by him; and the likeness of the form of salutation may confirm
his being the writer of this epistle.

\(f\) T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 110. 2.

[James 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 1:2</span></span>

My brethren,.... Not only according to the flesh, he being a Jew as they
were; but in a spiritual sense, they being born again of the same grace,
belonging to the same family and household of faith, and having the same
Father, and being all the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus:

count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; not the
temptations of Satan, or temptations to sin; for these cannot be matter
of joy, but grief; these are fiery darts, and give a great deal of
uneasiness and trouble; but afflictions and persecutions for the sake of
the Gospel, which are so called here and elsewhere, because they are
trials of the faith of God's people, and of other graces of the Spirit
of God. God by these tempts his people, as he did Abraham, when he
called him to sacrifice his son; he thereby tried his faith, fear, love,
and obedience; so by afflictions, God tries the graces of his people;
not that he might know them, for he is not ignorant of them, but that
they might be made manifest to others; and these are "divers": many are
the afflictions of the righteous; through much tribulation they must
enter the kingdom; it is a great fight of afflictions which they endure,
as these believers did; their trials came from different quarters; they
were persecuted by their countrymen the Jews, and were distressed by the
Gentiles, among whom they lived; and their indignities and reproaches
were many; and their sufferings of different sorts, as confiscation of
goods, imprisonment of body, banishment, scourgings, and death in
various shapes: and these they "fall" into; not by chance, nor
altogether at an unawares, or unexpectedly; but they fell into them
through the wickedness and malice of their enemies, and did not bring
them upon themselves through any crime or enormity they were guilty of:
and when this was their case, the apostle exhorts them to count it all
joy, or matter of joy, of exceeding great joy, even of the greatest joy;
not that these afflictions were joyous in themselves, but in their
circumstances, effects, and consequences; as they tried, and exercised,
and improved the graces of the Spirit, and worked for their good,
spiritual and eternal, and produced in them the peaceable fruit of
righteousness; and as they were attended with the presence and Spirit of
God, and of glory; and as they made for, and issued in the glory of God;
and because of that great reward in heaven which would follow them; see
[Mat 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011). The Jews have a saying (g.md),

"whoever rejoices in afflictions that come upon him, brings salvation to
the world.''

\(g\) T. Bab. Taanith, fol. 8. 1.

[James 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 1:3</span></span>

Knowing this,.... By experience; as everyone that is trained up in the
school of affliction does: the apostle appeals to the saints, to whom he
writes, for the truth of what he was about to say; and which he gives as
a reason why they should rejoice in afflictions, because it is a known
fact,

that the trying of your faith worketh patience: two things afflictions
do when sanctified; one is, they try faith, the truth of it, and make it
appear to be true, genuine, and precious, like gold tried in the fire;
see [Pe1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md) and the other is, that
they produce patience: saints being inured to afflictions, become by
degrees more patient under them; whence it is good for a man to bear the
yoke in his youth: this phrase may be understood, both of faith, which
being tried by afflictions, produces patience; for where the one is in
exercise, the other is also, and both are necessary under afflictive
providences; and also of afflictions, which try faith, and being
sanctified by the Spirit of God, work patience, which is a fruit of the
Spirit; for otherwise the effect of them is impatience; and this agrees
with the Apostle Paul in [Rom 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003.md).

[James 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 1:4</span></span>

But let patience have her perfect work,.... Or effect; or be brought
unto perfection; which may denote both the sincerity and continuance of
it unto the end, with constancy: patience may be said to be perfect,
when it appears to be real and sincere, and not dissembled; for as there
may be a feigned faith, a dissembled love, and an hypocritical hope, so
likewise a mere show of patience: and certain it is, that as there is a
patience which is commendable, there is one that is not, [Pe1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020.md). And this phrase may also design
the constant exercise of this grace to the end; for he that endures, or
is patient, and continues so unto the end, shall be saved, and enjoy
that perfection of glory and happiness expressed in the next clause:

that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing; which cannot be
understood of the saints in this present life; only as they are in
Christ, and in a comparative sense; or as perfection may denote
sincerity, and uprightness; or of a perfection of parts, but not of
degrees; for the saints are very imperfect in themselves, and are very
far from being complete in soul, body, and spirit; and want many things,
and are wanting in many things, both in the exercise of grace, and in
the discharge of duty; but when patience has had its perfect work, and
has been tried to the uttermost, and is found right, and has held out to
the end; then shall the saints be perfect in holiness and happiness, and
be entire, whole, and complete; as they will be in the resurrection
morn, both in soul and body, and will want no good thing, and will be
free from every sorrow, nor will they be deficient in any service; and
to this sense agrees [Jam 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md).

[James 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 1:5</span></span>

If any of you lack wisdom,.... This shows that the perfection before
spoken of is not to be understood as in this life, since the apostle
immediately supposes lack of wisdom in them; for this is not said in a
form of doubting, whether they wanted it or not, but rather as
supposing, and taking it for granted that they did; and in the first,
and primary sense of the words, it intends wisdom to behave aright under
temptations or afflictions. Saints often want wisdom to consider God as
the author of them, and not look upon them as matters of chance, or
impute them merely to second causes; but to regard them as coming from
the hand of God, and as his hand upon them, as Job did; who does not
ascribe his calamities to the thieving Chaldeans and Sabeans, to the
boisterous wind, and to the malice of Satan, but to God: they want
wisdom to observe the sovereignty of God in them, and bow unto it, and
be still, and know that he is God, who does all things well and wisely;
and likewise to see and know that all are in love, and in very
faithfulness, and for good; as well as to see his name, to hear his rod,
and him that has appointed it, his voice in it, his mind and meaning,
and what he designs by it; as likewise to learn the useful lessons under
it, and particularly to take the cross well, to bear it patiently, and
even to count it all joy, and reckon it to be right, necessary, and
useful: it requires much wisdom to learn all this, and act up to it.
Moreover, this may be applied to all other cases, in which wisdom is
wanted; men want wisdom to conduct them in the common affairs of life,
and especially the people of God; for the children of the world are
wiser in their generation, for themselves and posterity, and in the
management of worldly affairs, than the children of light; and also to
observe the providences of God, and the footsteps of Providence, and to
follow them; and likewise to make a right use of providences, and behave
suitably under them, and not be lifted up too much in prosperity, nor be
cast down, and too much distressed in adversity; but to consider, that
the one is set against the other, and both work together for good.
Saints have need of wisdom in things spiritual; they want more grace,
which is the truest wisdom, and a larger knowledge of the Gospel, which
is the wisdom of God, the hidden wisdom of God; and they lack wisdom to
know how to walk towards them that are without, and towards them that
are within, so as becomes the Gospel of Christ: and as this is more or
less the case of everyone

let him ask of God wisdom; of God the Father, who is the only wise God,
who has abounded in creation, in providence, and, above all, in
redemption and grace, in all wisdom and prudence; and of his Son Jesus
Christ, who is the wisdom of God, and has all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge in him; and of the Spirit of God, who is a Spirit of
wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Christ, and all divine things:

that giveth to all men liberally; God is the giver of all good things,
in nature, providence, and grace; every good and perfect gift comes from
him, and therefore he, and he only, should be applied unto: and he gives
to "all men" the bounties of his providence; and to all that ask, and
call upon him in sincerity, the riches of his grace; even to Jews and
Gentiles, high and low, rich and poor, greater or lesser sinners; all
which he gives "liberally", readily, and at once, freely and cheerfully,
and largely and abundantly; not grudgingly, sparingly, and with a strait
hand, but with an open one, and in a very extensive manner.

And upbraideth not; with former sins and transgressions, with former
miscarriages and misconduct; or with former kindnesses, suggesting that
he had given largely already, and his favours had been despised or
abused; or he had been treated with ingratitude and neglect; in which
manner sometimes men put off those that apply unto them, but so does not
God; wherefore every word here used is encouraging to go to God for
wisdom: yea, it follows,

and it shall be given him; God has said it, Christ has promised it, and
the apostle might, with certainty, say it after them, and all experience
confirms the truths of it; See [Mat
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md).

[James 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 1:6</span></span>

But let him ask in faith,.... Not only in the faith of the divine Being
that God is; but in the faith of the promises he has made; and in the
faith of his power and faithfulness to perform them; and in the faith of
this, that whatever is asked, according to the will of God, and is for
his glory, and his people's good, shall be given.

Nothing wavering; about the thing asked for, whether it is right or no
to ask for it; for that should be settled before it is asked for; nor
about the power of God to do it; nor about his will, in things he has
declared he will do; nor about his faithfulness to his promises; nor at
all questioning but what is proper, suitable, and convenient, will be
given in God's own time and way.

For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
tossed; he is troubled, restless, unquiet, and impatient; and he is
fickle, inconstant, unstable, and unsettled; and is easily carried away
with every wind of doctrine, temptation, and lust.

[James 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 1:7</span></span>

For let not that man think,.... Imagine, conclude, or please himself
with such thoughts,

that he shall receive anything from the Lord; wisdom, or anything else,
he is seeking after; for wanting faith, he has nothing to receive with;
faith is the grace, which receives the Lord Jesus Christ himself, and
all grace from him; which receives a justifying righteousness, pardon of
sin, adoption of children, and even the everlasting inheritance, at
least, the right unto it; wherefore those who have not faith, as the
wavering man, cannot receive any thing.

[James 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 1:8</span></span>

A double minded man,.... A man of two souls, or of a double heart, that
speaks and asks with an heart, and an heart, as in [Psa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002.md) who halts between two opinions,
and is at an uncertainty what to do or say, and is undetermined what to
ask for; or who is not sincere and upright in his requests, who asks for
one thing, and means another, and asks amiss, and with an ill design;
does not call upon God in truth, and in the sincerity of his soul; draws
nigh to him with his mouth, and honours him with his lips, but his heart
is far from him. Such an one is

unstable in all his ways; he is confused in his mind; restless in his
thoughts, unsettled in his designs and intentions; inconstant in his
petitions; uncertain in his notions and opinion of things; and very
variable in his actions, and especially in matters of religion; he is
always changing, and never at a point, but at a continual uncertainty,
both in a way of thinking and doing: he never continues long either in
an opinion, or in a practice, but is ever shifting and moving.

[James 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 1:9</span></span>

Let the brother of low degree,.... By "the brother" is meant, not one in
a natural, but in a spiritual relation; one of Christ's brethren, and
who is of that family that is named of him; of the household of faith,
and is in church communion: and whereas he is said to be of "low
degree", or "humble", this regards not the affection of his mind, or his
conduct and deportment, he being meek and lowly, and clothed with
humility, as every brother is, or ought to be; but his outward state and
condition, being, as to the things of this world, poor, and mean in his
outward circumstances, and so humbled and afflicted. This appears from
the rich man, who, in the next verse, is opposed unto him, and
distinguished from him; see [Psa 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009.md)
such an one is advised to

rejoice in that he is exalted; or to "glory in his exaltation"; in that
high estate, to which he is advanced; for a person may be very low and
mean, as to his worldly circumstances, and yet be very high, and greatly
exalted in a spiritual sense: and this height of honour and grandeur, of
which he may boast and glory, amidst his outward poverty, lies in his
high birth and descent, being born from above, and of God, and belonging
to his family; in being an adopted Son of God, and so an heir of God,
and a joint-heir with Christ, and of the heavenly inheritance and
kingdom; in the present riches of grace he is possessed of, as
justifying, pardoning, and sanctifying grace; and in the high titles he
bears, as besides the new name, the name better than that of sons and
daughters of the greatest potentate, even that of a Son of the Lord God
Almighty, his being a King, and a priest unto God, and for whom a
kingdom, crown, and throne are prepared; and also in the company he
daily keeps, and is admitted to, as of God, and Christ, and the holy
angels: and this height of honour have all the saints, be they ever so
poor in this world, who can vie with the greatest of princes for
sublimity and grandeur.

[James 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 1:10</span></span>

But the rich, in that he is made low,.... That is, the rich brother; for
there were rich men in the churches in those times, and which James
often takes notice of in this epistle. Such an one should rejoice or
glory in his lowness, or low estate; in the consideration of the low
estate, out of which he was raised, by the good providence of God, and
was not owing to any merit of his; and in the low estate into which he
may be at present reduced, through the violence of persecution being
stripped of all his riches for Christ's sake, of which he might make his
boast, and count it his greatest glory; or in that low estate he may
quickly expect he shall be brought into, either in the above manner, or
by some calamity or another, and at least by death, which will put him
upon a level with others: or this may have respect to the temper of his
mind, which he has, through the grace of God, and the station he is in,
in the church of God, being a brother, and no more than a brother, and
upon an equal foot with the meanest member in it; and which yet is
matter of rejoicing, that he is one, and that he is so blessed with the
grace of humility, as not to lift up himself above others, not to mind
high things, but to condescend to men of low estate; and such a
deportment the apostle exhorts rich saints unto, from the consideration
of the instability and inconstancy of worldly riches.

Because, as the flower of the grass he shall pass away; shortly, and
suddenly; either he himself by death, or his riches at death, or before,
and therefore are not to be gloried in; nor should the possessors of
them be proud and haughty and elate themselves with them, but should
behave humbly and modestly to their fellow creatures and Christians, as
knowing that in a short time they will all be upon a par, or in an equal
state; See [Job 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002.md). The metaphor
here used is enlarged upon in the following verse, for the further
illustration of the fickleness, perishing, and transitory nature of
earthly enjoyments.

[James 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 1:11</span></span>

For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat,.... As it is about
the middle of the day, when it shines in its full strength, and its heat
is very great and scorching, especially in the summer season, and in hot
climates:

but it withereth the grass; strikes it with heat, causes it to shrivel,
and dries it up;

and the flower thereof falleth; drops off from it to the ground:

and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth; its form and colour, its
glory and beauty, which were pleasant to the eye, are lost, and no more
to be recovered. This shows, that earthly riches, like the flower of the
field, have an outward show and glory in them, which attract the mind,
and fix an attention to them for a while; they are gay and glittering,
and look lovely, are pleasant to behold, and desirable to enjoy; but
when the sun of persecution, or any other outward calamity arises, they
are quickly destroyed, and are no more.

So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways; riches are uncertain
things now, they often make themselves wings and flee away; they are
things that are not, that are not solid and substantial they are a vain
show; they sometimes fade away in a man's lifetime, before he dies; and
he fades away, and comes to decay, amidst all the ways and means,
designs and schemes, he forms and pursues, and all the actions and
business he does; and if not, when he fades away, and dies amidst all
his riches, his glory does not descend after him, but falls off from
him, as the flower of the field before the heat of the sun.

[James 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 1:12</span></span>

Blessed is the man that endureth temptation,.... Or affliction, which is
designed by temptation, as in [Jam 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md)
and the man that endures it is he that so bears it, and bears up under
it, as not to be offended at it, and stumble in the ways of Christ, and
fall away from the truth, and a profession of it, as temporary believers
in a time of temptation do; but manfully and bravely stands up under it,
and does not sink under the weight of it, or faint on account of it; and
endures afflictions in such manner as not to murmur and repine at them,
but is quiet and still, and bears them patiently and constantly, and so
endures to the end. Such expect afflictions, and when they come, they
are not moved by them, but, notwithstanding them, continue in the ways
and work of the Lord; and such are happy persons; they are happy now,
and shall be hereafter. Saints are happy under afflictions, and even on
account of them, for they are tokens of God's love to them, and
evidences of their sonship; and especially they are happy under them,
when they enjoy the presence of God in them, when they are instructive
to them, and are saner, lifted, when they learn from them the useful
lessons of faith, patience, humility, and resignation to the will of
God, and are made more partakers of his holiness; and they will be happy
hereafter, as follows. The Jews have a saying (h) much like this,

""blessed" is the man, , "who stands in his temptation", for there is no
creature whom the holy blessed God does not tempt.''

For when he is tried; by the fire of afflictions, as gold is tried in
the fire; when God hereby has tried what is in his heart, and the truth
of grace in him, as faith, love, patience, &c. and has purged away his
dross and tin, and has refined and purified him, as gold and silver are
refined and purified in the furnace, or refining pot: and when being
thus tried and proved, and found genuine, and comes forth as gold, after
this state of temptation and affliction is over,

he shall receive the crown of life, eternal happiness, called a "crown",
because of the glory of it, which will be both upon the bodies and souls
of believers to all eternity; and as suitable to their character, they
being kings, and having a kingdom and thrones prepared for them; and in
allusion to the crown that was given to the conquerors in the Olympic
games: and it is called a "crown of life", because it is for life, which
an earthly crown is not always; and because it lies in eternal life, and
is an everlasting crown; it is a crown of glory that fadeth not away, an
incorruptible one; and differs from the corruptible crown given to the
victors in the above mentioned games, which were made of fading herbs,
and leaves of trees: and now the man that bears up under afflictions,
and holds out unto the end, shall have this crown put upon him, and he
shall "receive it"; not as merited by him, by his works or sufferings,
for neither of them are worthy to be compared or mentioned with this
crown of life and glory; but as the free gift of God, as it will be
given him by the righteous Judge, as a reward of grace, and not of debt:

which the Lord hath promised to them that love him; either the Lord
Jesus Christ, as in [Mat 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010.md) or else
God the Father; the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, read,
"God"; and the Alexandrian copy leaves out the word "Lord", which may be
supplied by the word God; see [Jam 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005.md)
and this promise he made before the world was, who cannot lie, nor
deceive, and who is able to perform, and is faithful, and will never
suffer his faithfulness to fail; so that this happiness is certain, and
may be depended upon: besides, the promise of this crown of life is in
Christ, where all the promises are yea and amen; yea, the crown itself
is in his hands, where it lies safe and secure for "them that love him";
either the Lord Jesus Christ, his person, his people, his truths, and
ordinances, and his glorious appearing, [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md) or God the Father; not that their
love is the cause of this crown of life, or eternal life, for then it
would not be the free gift of God, as it is said to be; nor of the
promise of it, for that was made before the world was, and when they had
no love unto him; but this phrase is descriptive of the persons to whom
God manifests his love now, admits to near communion and fellowship with
himself, makes all things, even their afflictions, to work for their
good, and whom he will cause to inherit substance, and will fill their
treasures.

[James 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 1:13</span></span>

Let no man say when he is tempted,.... Here the apostle uses the word
"tempted", in another sense than he did before. Before he speaks of
temptations, as matter of joy and boasting, here of temptations, which
are criminal, and issue in shame and death; the temptations he before
makes mention of, being patiently endured, denominate men happy, but
here such are designed, which are to be deprecated, and watched against;
before he treats of temptations, which were the means of trying and
exercising grace, and of purging away the dross of sin and corruption,
but here of temptations to sin, and which are in themselves sinful;
before he discourses of temptations in which God was concerned; but here
of temptations which he removes from him, and denies of him, as being
unworthy of him: wherefore, when any man is tempted to sin, whether when
under adversity, or in prosperity, let him not say,

I am tempted of God; for God is holy, and without iniquity, nor does he
delight in sin, but hates and abhors it; nor can he commit it, it being
contrary to his nature, and the perfections of it; whereas no one can
tempt another to sin, unless he is sinful himself, and delights in sin,
and in those that commit it, nor without committing it himself; and yet
sinful men are apt to charge God with their sins, and temptations to
them, in imitation of their first parent, Adam, when fallen, [Gen
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#012.md) who, to excuse himself, lays the
blame upon the woman, and ultimately upon God, who gave her to him; and
suggests, that if it had not been for the woman, he should not have ate
of the forbidden fruit, nor should he have had any temptation to it, had
not God given him the woman to be with him, and therefore it was his
fault; and in this sad manner do his sons and daughters reason, who,
when, through affliction, they murmur against God, distrust his
providence, or forsake his ways, say, if he had not laid his hand upon
them, or suffered such afflictions to befall them, they had not been
guilty of such sin: he himself is the occasion of them; but let no man
talk at this wicked rate,

for God cannot be tempted with evil; or "evils", He was tempted by the
Israelites at Massah and Meribah, from which those places had their
names, who by their murmuring, distrust and unbelief, proved and tried
his patience and his power; and so he may be, and has been tempted by
others in a like way; he may be tempted by evil men, and with evil
things, but he cannot be tempted "to evil", as the Ethiopic version
renders it; he is proof against all such temptations: he cannot be
tempted by anything in himself, who is pure and holy, or by any creature
or thing without him, to do any sinful action:

neither tempteth he any man; that is, to sin; he tempted Abraham, to try
his faith, love, and obedience to him; he tempted the Israelites in the
wilderness, to try them and humble them, and prove what was in their
hearts; and he tempted Job, and tried his faith and patience; and so he
tempts and tries all his righteous ones, by afflictions, more or less:
but he never tempts or solicits them to sin; temptations to sin come
from another quarter, as follows.

[James 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 1:14</span></span>

But every man is tempted,.... To sin, and he falls in with the
temptation, and by it,

when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed; the metaphor is taken
either from fishes, who are enticed by the bait, and drawn out by the
hook; or from a lascivious woman, who meeting with a young man, entices
him, and draws him away after her to commit iniquity with her: by "lust"
is meant the principle of corrupt nature, which has its residence in the
heart of man; is natural and hereditary to him, and therefore is called
his own; he is conceived and shapen in it; he brings it into the world
with him, and it continues in him, and is called his own heart's lust,
[Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md). Now this meeting with some
bait, which entices and draws it out, or with some external object,
which promises pleasure or profit, a man is allured, and ensnared, and
drawn away by it, and so the temptation begins: thus, for instance,
covetousness was the predominant lust in Judas; this meeting with an
external object, or objects, which promised him profit, he is at once
enticed and drawn away to betray his Lord and master for the sake of it:
so sin often promises pleasure, though it is but an imaginary, and a
short lived one; which takes with a man's own lust, and corruption
within him, and so he is allured and drawn aside; and to this, and not
to God, should he attribute temptation to sin.

[James 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 1:15</span></span>

Then when lust hath conceived,.... A proposal of pleasure or profit
being made, agreeable to lust, or the principle of corrupt nature,
sinful man is pleased with it; and instead of resisting and rejecting
the motion made, he admits of it, and receives it, and cherishes it in
his mind; he dallies and plays with it; he dwells upon it in his
thoughts, and hides it under his tongue, and in his heart, as a sweet
morsel, and forsakes it not, but contrives ways and means how to bring
it about; and this is lust's conceiving. The figure is used in [Psa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014.md) on which Kimchi, a Jewish
commentator, has this note;

"he (the psalmist) compares the thoughts of the heart "to a conception",
and when they go out in word, this is "travail", and in work or act,
this is "bringing forth".''

And so it follows here,

it bringeth forth sin; into act, not only by consenting to it, but by
performing it:

and sin, when it is finished: being solicited, is agreed to, and
actually committed:

bringeth forth death; as the first sin of man brought death into the
world, brought a spiritual death, or moral death upon man, subjected him
to a corporeal death, and made him liable to an eternal one; so every
sin is deserving of death, death is the just wages of it; yea, even the
motions of sin work in men to bring forth fruit unto death. Something
like these several gradual steps, in which sin proceeds, is observed by
the Jews, and expressed in much the like language, in allegorizing the
case of Lot, and his two daughters (i);

"the concupiscent soul (or "lust") stirs up the evil figment, and
imagines by it, and it cleaves to every evil imagination, "until it
conceives a little", and produces in the heart of man the evil thought,
and cleaves to it; and as yet it is in his heart, and is not "finished"
to do it, until this desire or lust stirs up the strength of the body,
first to cleave to the evil figment, and then , "sin is finished"; as it
is said, [Gen 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#036.md).''

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jam 1:16</span></span>

Do not err, my beloved brethren. For to make God the author of sin, or
to charge him with being concerned in temptation to sin, is a very great
error, a fundamental one, which strikes at the nature and being of God,
and at the perfection of his holiness: it is a denying of him, and is
one of those damnable errors and heresies, which bring upon men swift
destruction; and therefore to be guarded against, rejected, and abhorred
by all that profess any regard unto him, his name and glory.

[James 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 1:17</span></span>

Every good gift and every perfect gift,.... Whether of nature,
providence, or grace, and especially the latter; spiritual gifts given
along with Christ, or spiritual blessings in him; every such gift is; as
the Vulgate Latin version reads, the "best" gift; better than those
which only relate to the present life: and is "perfect" such as the
gifts of righteousness, remission of sins, adoption, regeneration, and
eternal life. The Jews say (k), that the good things of this world are
not truly good, in comparison of the good things of the world to come,
and are not , "a perfect good." And every such an one is from above; is
not from a man's self, from the creature, or from below, but from
heaven, and from God who dwells there:

and cometh down from the Father of lights; or author of lights; of all
corporeal light; as the sun, moon, and stars; of all natural, rational,
and moral light, in angels and men; of all spiritual light, or the light
of grace in regenerate persons; and of eternal light, the light of glory
in the spirits of just then made perfect:

with whom is no variableness, nor shadow of turning: as there is in that
great luminary, the sun in the firmament, which has its parallaxes,
eclipses, and turnings, and casts its shadow; it rises and sets, appears
and disappears every day; and it comes out of one tropic, and enters
into another at certain seasons of the year: but with God, who is light
itself, and in him is no darkness at all, there is no change, nor
anything like it; he is changeable in his nature, perfections, purposes,
promises, and gifts; wherefore he being holy, cannot turn to that which
is evil; nor can he, who is the fountain of light, be the cause of
darkness, or admit of any in him; and since every good and perfect gift
comes from him, evil cannot proceed from him, nor can he tempt any to
it.

\(k\) Tzeror Hammor, fol. 23. 2, 3.

[James 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jam 1:18</span></span>

Of his own will begat he us,.... The apostle instances in one of those
good and perfect gifts, regeneration; and he pitches upon a very proper
and pertinent one, since this is the first gift of grace God bestows
upon his people openly, and in their own persons; and is what involves
other gifts, and prepares and makes meet for the gift of eternal life;
and therefore may well be reckoned a "good" one, and it is also a
"perfect one"; it is done at once; there are no degrees in it, as in
sanctification; a man is born again, at once, and is born a perfect new
man in all his parts; no one is more regenerated than another, or the
same person more regenerated at one time than at another: and this comes
from above; it is called a being born from above, in [Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003.md) as the words there may be
rendered; and it comes from God the Father, even the Father of our Lord
Jesus, as well as of all lights, [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md) and who in it produces light, in
darkness, and whose gifts of grace bestowed along with it are without
repentance. And since this comes from him, he cannot be the author of
evil, or tempt unto it. This is a settled and certain point, that all
the good that is in men, and is done by them, comes from God; and all
the evil that is in them, and done by them, is of themselves. This act
of begetting here ascribed to God, is what is elsewhere called a
begetting again, that is, regeneration; it is an implantation of new
principles of light and life, grace and holiness, in men; a quickening
of them, when dead in trespasses and sins; a forming of Christ in their
souls; and a making them partakers of the divine nature; and this is
God's act, and not man's. Earthly parents cannot beget in this sense;
nor ministers of the word, not causally, but only instrumentally, as
they are instruments and means, which God makes use of; neither the
ministry of the word, nor the ordinance of baptism, can of themselves
regenerate any; nor can a man beget himself, as not in nature, so not in
grace: the nature of the thing shows it, and the impotent case of men
proves it: this is God's act, and his only; see [Joh
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013.md) and the impulsive or moving cause
of it is his own will. God does not regenerate, or beget men by
necessity of nature, but of his own free choice; Christ, the Son of God,
is begotten of him by necessity of nature, and not as the effect of his
will; he is the brightness of his glory necessarily, as the beams and
rays of light are necessarily emitted by the sun; but so it is not in
regeneration: nor does God regenerate men through any consideration of
their will, works, and merits: nor have these any influence at all upon
it; but he begets of his own free grace and favour, and of his rich and
abundant mercy, and of his sovereign will and pleasure, according to his
counsels and purposes of old. And the means he makes use of, or with
which he does it, is

with the word of truth; not Christ, who is the Word, and truth itself;
though regeneration is sometimes ascribed to him; and this act of
begetting is done by the Father, through the resurrection of Christ from
the dead; but the Gospel, which is the word of truth, and truth itself,
and contains nothing but truth; and by this souls are begotten and born
again; see [Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md) and hence
ministers of it are accounted spiritual fathers. Faith, and every other
grace in regeneration, and even the Spirit himself, the Regenerator,
come this way: and the end is,

that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures; either of his
new creatures, and so it has respect to such, as James, and others; who
received the firstfruits of the Spirit, who first hoped and trusted in
Christ, and were openly in him, and converted to him before others; or
of his creatures, of mankind in general, who, with the Jews, are usually
called creatures; See Gill on [Mar
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015.md), and designs those who are
redeemed from among men, and are the firstfruits to God, and to the
Lamb, as their regeneration makes appear: and this shows that such as
are begotten again, or regenerated, are separated and distinguished from
others, as the firstfruits be; and that they are preferred unto, and are
more excellent than the rest of mankind, being made so by the grace of
God; and that they are by regenerating grace devoted to the service of
God, and are formed for his praise and glory.

[James 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jam 1:19</span></span>

Wherefore, my beloved brethren,.... Since the Gospel, the word of truth,
is the means and instrument which God makes use of in regeneration, and
in forming people for himself:

let every man be swift to hear; not anything; not idle and unprofitable
talk, or filthy and corrupt communication; but wholesome advice, good
instructions, and the gracious experiences of the saints, and, above
all, the word of God; to the hearing of which men should fly, as doves
to their windows; should make haste, and be early in their attendance on
it, as well, as constant; and receive it with all readiness, and with a
sort of greediness of mind, that their souls may be profited, and God
may be glorified: the phrase is Jewish; things easy and smooth, a man is
, "swift to hear them (l): slow to speak"; against what is heard,
without thoroughly weighing and considering what is said; and this may
regard silence under hearing the word, and is also a rule to be observed
in private conversation: or the sense may be, be content to be hearers
of the word, and not forward to be preachers of it; and if called to
that work, think before you speak, meditate on the word, and study to be
approved to God and men. Silence is not only highly commended by the
Pythagoreans, among whom it was enjoined their disciples five years (m);
but also by the Jews: they say, nothing is better for the body than
silence; that if a word is worth one shekel, silence is worth two, or
worth a precious stone; that it is the spice of speech, and the chief of
all spices; that it is the hedge of wisdom; hence it is the advice of
Shammai; "say little, and do much" (n): and they cry up, as a very
excellent precept, "be silent, and hear"; and as containing more than
persons are aware of (o):

slow to wrath; in hearing; when admonitions and reproofs are given, sin
is exposed, and vice corrected, and the distinguishing doctrines of
grace, are preached; which are apt to fill natural men with wrath, and
which must greatly hinder the usefulness of the word; see [Luk
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#028.md). This is omitted in the Ethiopic
version.

For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. This is so
far from engaging persons to do that which is right and acceptable in
the sight of God, that it puts them upon doing that which is evil. The
Alexandrian copy reads, "with the wrath of men do not work the
righteousness of God"; do not attend upon the word and ordinances of God
with a wrathful spirit. Compare, with this, [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md).

[James 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jam 1:21</span></span>

Wherefore lay apart all filthiness,.... All manner of filthiness, both
of flesh and spirit; all pride, vanity, wrath, malice, and evil
speaking, under hearing the word: the allusion seems to be to a boiling
pot, which casts up scum and filth, which must be taken off: and such is
the spirit of wrathful men; it throws up the filth of haughtiness and
pride, of anger, wrath, and wickedness, which must be taken off, and
laid aside; or the word will not be heard to any profit, or advantage:

and superfluity of naughtiness, or "malice"; the abundance and overflow
of it, which arises from such an evil heart, where wrath prevails, and
governs: see [Pe1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md). There seems to
be an allusion to the removing of the superfluous foreskin of the flesh,
in circumcision, typical

of the foreskin of the heart, spoken of in [Jer
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004.md) which the Targum, in that place,
calls , "the wickedness", or "naughtiness of your hearts" to be removed:

and receive with meekness the ingrafted word; which becomes so when it
is received; when it is put into the heart by the Spirit of God, and is
mixed with faith by them that hear it; so that it is, as it were,
incorporated into them, and becomes natural to them, which before was
not; and taking deep root in them, brings forth much fruit: and where it
comes with power, it reduces every high thought into the obedience of
Christ, and makes men meek and humble; and only such receive the truth
in the love of it; and to such is the Gospel preached, [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md), and none but such hear it with
profit and edification:

which is able to save your souls; even your whole persons, both soul and
body: but the soul is only mentioned, as being the more excellent part
of man: this must not be understood of the word, as if it was the author
or cause of salvation, but as an instrument; it being a declaration of
salvation by Christ, or what shows unto men the way of salvation by him;
and is the power of God unto salvation to them, when it is attended with
the energy of the Spirit, and the efficacy of divine grace. See [Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015.md).

[James 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jam 1:22</span></span>

But be ye doers of the word,.... And they are such, who spiritually
understand it; gladly receive it; and from the heart obey it, and make a
sincere and ingenuous profession of it; and who submit to the ordinances
it directs to, and keep them as they have been delivered; and live, and
walk, becoming their profession of it. The Arabic and Ethiopic versions
read, "be ye doers of the law"; and so one of Stephens's copies, as in
[Rom 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013.md)

and not hearers only; though the word should be heard swiftly and
readily, and received with meekness; yet it should not be barely heard,
and assented to; but what is heard should be put in practice; and
especially men should not depend upon their hearing, as if that would
save them; this is deceiving your own selves; such as rest upon the
outward hearing of the word will be sadly deceived, and will find
themselves miserably mistaken, another day; see [Luk
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#025.md). Arguments taken from hence are
like the sophisms, paralogisms, and false reasonings of sophisters,
which carry a fair show, and ensnare and deceive.

[James 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jam 1:23</span></span>

But if any man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer,.... The Arabic
version here again reads, "a hearer of the law", and so some copies; not
hearing, but practice, is the main thing; not theory, but action: hence,
says R. Simeon, not the word, or the searching into it, and the
explanation of it, is the root, or principal thing, , "but the work"
(p): and if a man is only a preacher, or a hearer, and not a doer,

he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass; or, "the
face of his generation"; the face with which he was born; his true,
genuine, native face; in distinction from any counterfeit one, or from
the face of his mind: it means his own corporeal face. The Ethiopic
version renders it, "the lineaments of his face".

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jam 1:24</span></span>

For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way,.... He takes a slight
glance of himself, and departs:

and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was; he forgets either
his spots, blemishes, and imperfections; or his comeliness and beauty;
the features of his face, be they comely or not: so a bare hearer of the
word, who is not concerned to practise what he hears, while he is
hearing, he observes some things amiss in himself, and some excellencies
in Christ; but, when the discourse is over, he goes his way, and thinks
no more of either.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jam 1:25</span></span>

But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty,.... By which is
meant, not the moral law, but the Gospel; for only of that is the
apostle speaking in the context: this is no other than the word of
truth, with which God begets men of his own will; and is the ingrafted
word which is able to save, and of which men should be doers, as well as
hearers, [Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md), and this is
compared to a glass by the Apostle Paul, [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018.md), and the word here used for
looking into it is the same word the Apostle Peter uses of the angels,
who desired to look into the mysteries of the Gospel, [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md) all which serve to strengthen
this sense; now the Gospel is called a law; not that it is a law,
strictly speaking, consisting precepts, and established and enforced by
sanctions penalties; for it is a declaration of righteousness and
salvation by Christ; a publication of peace and pardon by him; and a
free promise of eternal life, through him; but as it is an instruction,
or doctrine: the law with the Jews is called because it is teaching and
instructive; and everything that is so is by them called by this name:
hence we find the doctrine of the Messiah, which is no other than the
Gospel, is in the Old Testament called the law of the Lord, and his law,
[Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md) and in the New Testament it
is called the law, or doctrine of faith, [Rom
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027.md) and this doctrine is perfect, as
in [Psa 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007.md), it being a perfect plan
of truths, containing in it all truth, as it is in Jesus, even all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and because it is a revelation of
things perfect; of the perfect righteousness of Christ, and of perfect
justification by it, and of free and full pardon of sins through him,
and of complete salvation by him; and because it directs to Christ, in
whom perfection is: and it is a law or doctrine of liberty; , "that
which is if liberty"; which has liberty for its subject, which treats of
it, even of the liberty wherewith Christ makes his people free: the
Gospel proclaims this liberty to captive souls; and is the word of
truth, which makes them free, or is the means of freeing them from the
slavery of sin, from the captivity of Satan, and from the bondage of the
law; and is what gives souls freedom and boldness at the throne of
grace; and is that which leads them into the liberty of grace here, and
gives them a view and hope of the glorious liberty of the children of
God hereafter. This doctrine is as a glass to look into; in which is
beheld the glory of Christ's person and office, and grace; and though by
the law is the knowledge of sin, yet a man never so fully and clearly
discovers the sin that dwells in him, and the swarms of corruption which
are in his heart, as when the light of the glorious Gospel shines into
him, and when in it he beholds the beauty and glory of Jesus Christ; see
[Isa 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005.md) and looking into this glass,
or into this doctrine, is by faith, and with the eyes of the
understanding, opened and enlightened by the Spirit of God; and the word
here used signifies a looking wistly and intently, with great care and
thought, and not in a slight and superficial manner; and such a looking
is designed, as is attended with effect; such an one as transforms into
the same image that is beheld, from glory to glory; and happy is the man
that so looks into it.

And continueth therein; is not moved away from the hope of the Gospel,
nor carried about with divers and strange doctrines; but is established
in the faith, stands fast in it, and abides by it; or continues looking
into this glass, and to Christ, the author and finisher of faith, who is
beheld in it; and keeps his eye upon it, and the object held forth in
it; and constantly attends the ministration of it:

he being not a forgetful hearer; but takes heed to the things he hears
and sees, lest he should let them slip; and being conscious of the
weakness of his memory, implores the divine Spirit to be his
remembrancer, and bring to his mind, with fresh power and light, what he
has heard:

but a doer of the work; of the work of faith, and labour of love, and
patience of hope, and of every work and ordinance the Gospel ministry
points unto; doing and being subject to all in faith, from a principle
of love, and with a view to the glory of God and Christ.

This man shall be blessed in his deed; or "doing", and while he is
doing; not that he is blessed for what he does, but "in" what he does;
see [Psa 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011.md) he having, in hearing
the word, and looking into it, and in submitting to every ordinance of
the Gospel, the presence of God, the discoveries of his love, communion
with Christ, and communication of grace from him by the Spirit; so that
Wisdom's ways become ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace;
see [Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004.md), moreover, in all such a
man does, he is prosperous and successful; in all he does he prospers:
and so he is blessed in his deed, by God, whose blessing makes rich,
both in spirituals and temporals: there seems to be an allusion to the
blessed man in [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md).

If any man among you seem to be religious,.... By his preaching, or
praying, and hearing, and other external duties of religion, he is
constant in the observance of; and who, upon the account of these
things, "thinks himself to be a religious man", as the Vulgate Latin,
Syriac, and Arabic versions render it; or is thought to be so by others:

and bridleth not his tongue; but boasts of his works, and speaks ill of
his brethren; backbites them, and hurts their names and characters, by
private insinuations, and public charges without any foundation; who
takes no care of what he says, but gives his tongue a liberty of
speaking anything, to the injury of others, and the dishonour of God,
and his ways: there seems to be an allusion to [Psa
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md).

But deceiveth his own heart; with his show of religion, and external
performances; on which he builds his hopes of salvation; of which he is
confident; and so gives himself to a loose way of talking what he
pleases:

this man's religion is vain; useless, and unprofitable to himself and
others; all his preaching, praying, hearing, and attendance on the
ordinances will be of no avail to him; and he, notwithstanding these, by
his evil tongue, brings a scandal and reproach upon the ways of God, and
doctrines of Christ.

[James 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jam 1:27</span></span>

Pure religion and undefiled,.... That which is sincere and genuine, and
free from adulteration and hypocrisy:

before God and the Father; or in the sight of God the Father of Christ,
and all his people; that which is approved of by him, who is the
searcher of hearts, and the trier of the reins of men, "is this": not
that the apostle is giving a full definition of true religion; only he
mentions some of the effects of it, by which it is known, and without
which it cannot be true and genuine; and they are these:

to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction; and not only to
see them, and speak a word of comfort to them, but to communicate to
them, and supply their wants, as they may require, and according to the
ability God has given: where there is true religion in the heart, there
is love to God; and where there is love to God, there is love to the
saints; and this will show itself to them, in times of affliction and
distress; and where this is wanting, religion itself is not pure and
undefiled:

and to keep himself unspotted from the world: from the men of the world,
who defile by their evil communications; and "from the vices of the
world", as the Arabic version renders it, which are of a defiling
nature; and, where religion is in its power and purity, and the Gospel
of the grace of God comes with efficacy, it teaches to separate from the
rest of the world, and to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to
live soberly, righteously, and godly.
