[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 148:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO PSALM 148

This psalm seems to have been written about the same time, and by the
same person, as the preceding; even by the psalmist David, when he was
in profound peace, and at rest from all his enemies; and the kingdom of
Israel was in a well settled and prosperous condition, both with respect
to things civil and ecclesiastical, as appears from [Psa
148:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014.md). And as it may respect future
time, the times of the Messiah, of whom David was a type, it will have
its accomplishment in the latter day, when there will be just occasion
for all creatures, in heaven and earth, to praise the Lord; and which
the Evangelist John, in vision, saw and heard them doing, [Rev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011.md). Aben Ezra says, this psalm is
exceeding glorious and excellent, and has deep secrets in it; in which
the psalmist speaks of two worlds, the upper and the lower. As for the
title of this psalm, the Septuagint, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, and
Apollinarius, entitle it as the two preceding.

[Psalms 148:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 148:1</span></span>

Praise ye the Lord,.... Or, hallelujah: which, in some versions, and
with some interpreters, is the title of the psalm; expressive of the
subject matter of it, the praise of the Lord; and is an exhortation of
all creatures to it;

praise ye the Lord from the heavens; that is, those that are of the
heavens; let their praises of the Lord, of his perfections, works, and
benefits, resound from thence; the angels of heaven particularly, who
have their habitation and residence there, and sometimes descend from
thence on special business, by the order and appointment of their great
Creator and Master: so the Targum,

"praise the Lord, ye holy creatures from heaven.''

Though some take the phrase, "from heaven", to be descriptive of the
Lord, the object of praise, who is the Lord from heaven; the character
of Christ, the second Adam, [Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047.md); who is from above; came down
from heaven to do the will of God; and was in heaven, as to his divine
Person, while here on earth in human nature, working out the salvation
of men; for which he justly deserves the praise of all in heaven and in
earth. But as all creatures are distinguished in this psalm into
celestial and terrestrial, called upon to praise the Lord; this seems to
be the general character of the celestial ones, persons, bodies, and
things; as the phrase "from the earth", [Psa
148:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007.md), includes all in the terraqueous
globe;

praise him in the heights; either in the highest heavens where he
dwells, or with the highest notes of praise that can be raised; see [Psa
149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md). The Targum is,

"praise him, all the hosts of angels on high:''

or the high hosts of angels: but these are particularly mentioned in
[Psa 148:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 148:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 148:2</span></span>

Praise ye him, all his angels,.... The Targum adds, who minister before
him: the ministering spirits, the angels of Jehovah, even of Christ, who
are his creatures, and at his command; and whom he sends forth to
minister to others, [Heb 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md). And
great numbers there are of them, thousands and tens of thousands, yea,
an innumerable company; and all of them are under obligation to praise
the Lord for their creation: for invisible spirits, as well as visible
bodies, even the celestial thrones, dominions, principalities, and
powers, were created by him, by Christ, [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md). And for their preservation in
their beings, and confirmation in that happy estate in which they were
created; being chosen and secured in Christ, the head of all
principality and power, and so stood while others fell: and also for the
various excellent powers, and faculties and properties, they are endowed
with; they excel in strength, are possessed of great agility and
swiftness; have a large share of knowledge, of things natural, civil,
moral, spiritual, and evangelical; are perfectly holy, and without sin;
and happy in the enjoyment of God, in whose presence they always are,
and whose face they continually behold; and will ever remain in this
state, being immaterial and immortal beings. And as praise is their
duty, it is their work; in this they were employed at the creation of
all things, then these sons of God and morning stars sang and shouted
for joy; and at the incarnation of Christ, when they worshipped him; at
the conversion of every sinner; and frequently join the church in this
service, and will be concerned in it to all eternity: and when the
psalmist calls upon them to engage in it, it does not suppose that they
were deficient in it, or backward to it, or that he had any authority
over them to require it of them; but it shows his great desire that the
Lord might be praised by the noblest creatures, and in the best manner
that could be, and how much his heart was in this work; and he does it
to stir up himself and others the more unto it, from this consideration;
that if those heavenly creatures should praise the Lord, then much more
such as he and others, who were so very unworthy of the divine favours,
and so much beholden to the Lord for them;

praise ye him, all his hosts; meaning either the angels as before,
sometimes called the hosts of heaven, and the heavenly host; there being
armies and legions of them, and these encamping about the saints in a
military way; see [Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md); or else
the celestial bodies, the sun, moon, and stars, as follow, sometimes
called the host of heaven; and who are represented as militant, [Gen
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001.md), [Kg2
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 148:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 148:3</span></span>

Praise ye him, sun and moon,.... The sun praises the Lord, the Creator
of it, by doing the work constantly it is appointed to do; to rule by
day, and give light and heat to the earth, and the inhabitants of it;
and so is the cause of man's praising the Lord for the benefits they
receive from it; for its enlightening, warming, and refreshing rays; and
for the precious fruits brought forth by it and so the moon likewise
doing its office, ruling by night, and reflecting the light of the sun
upon the earth, and producing precious fruits, also praises its Maker,
and is the occasion, of others praising him; see [Psa
136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md);

praise him, all ye stars of light; which are very beneficial in the
night season, especially to mariners and travellers, and shed their
benign influences upon the earth and things in it; which are a means of
praising the Lord, and in their way they do it, [Psa
136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md). The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin,
Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, read it, "stars and light",
wrongly; the stars are luminous bodies, and shine in their own light
(c), though the moon with a borrowed light from the sun.

\(c\) Macrob. in Somn. Scipion. l. 1. c. 19, 20.

[Psalms 148:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 148:4</span></span>

Praise him, ye heaven of heavens,.... All the heavens, the airy and
starry heavens; and the third heaven, the residence of God, angels and
saints: these are made by the Lord, and declare the glory of his power,
wisdom, and goodness, and show forth his handiwork, [Psa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md). A voice was heard from heaven,
praising Jehovah the Son, when on earth in our nature; a cloud of the
lower heavens received him when he went from hence, and in the clouds
thereof he will come again: the highest heavens opened to receive him,
and will retain him until the restitution of all things; and from hence
he will descend to judge the world in righteousness, [Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md);

and ye waters that be above the heavens; divided by the firmament from
the waters below; and are no other than the thick clouds, in which the
waters are bound up, and not rent, but at the pleasure of God, [Gen
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007); so Seneca (d.md) calls the clouds
the celestial waters. And these give men occasion to praise the Lord,
that those vast bodies of water that are over their heads are not let
down in such large quantities upon them as would destroy them; and that
are carried about from place to place, and let down and gentle showers,
to water and refresh the earth, and make it fruitful, so that it brings
forth food for man and beast. The Targum is,

"ye waters, that by the Word (of the Lord) hang above the heavens;''

in which is displayed the glory of amazing power, wisdom, and goodness.
The most ancient Syrians and Arabians were thoroughly persuaded, that
beyond the bounds of the visible heavens there was a great sea, without
any limits; which some (e) suppose to be the waters here meant.

[Psalms 148:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 148:5</span></span>

Let them praise the name of the Lord,.... Set forth the glory of the
nature and perfections of God, and celebrate the praise of them; even
all celestial creatures, the angels, the hosts of heaven, the sun, moon,
and stars; the heavens, and the haven of heavens, and the waters above
them; and that for the following reasons;

for he commanded, and they were created; they are all his creatures, and
therefore should praise him: he is the "Father of spirits", of angelic
spirits, as well as the spirits of men; and the "Father of lights", of
all the luminaries of the heavens; and he has made the heavens
themselves, and all their hosts, and the firmament dividing the waters
above and below; and all this by an almighty "fiat", at a word of
command; he spoke, and they came into being at once, [Heb
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md), [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md).

[Psalms 148:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 148:6</span></span>

He hath also stablished them for ever and ever,.... The angels are made
immortal, and shall never die; and they are confirmed in their state of
happiness by Christ, and shall always continue in it; the hosts of
heaven being created by him, consist in him, and will remain as long as
the world does; hence the duration and never-failing state of other
things, even of good men and their felicity, are expressed by them; see
[Psa 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md);

he hath made a decree which shall not pass; concerning those creatures
and their duration, which shall never pass away, or be frustrated or
made void; but shall always continue and have its sure and certain
effect; see [Jer 31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035.md); and is true of
every decree of God, which is eternal and not frustrable, and is always
fulfilled, [Isa 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#027.md).

[Psalms 148:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 148:7</span></span>

Praise the Lord from the earth,.... Let his praise resound from all
creatures on earth, and reach him in the highest heavens; this phrase
comprehends all terrestrial beings afterwards particularly mentioned;
all in the terraqueous globe, all that arise from it, are upon it, or
within it;

ye dragons, and all deeps; either land dragons, or rather sea dragons,
the water or sea being the proper place of them, [Psa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md); these, as cruel, as poisonous,
and pernicious as they are, are made to honour and praise the Lord, [Isa
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md); and such as are mystically
signified by, them, as Satan, tyrannical and persecuting princes, and
antichristian ones, as Pharaoh king of Egypt, Rome Pagan and Papal; out
of whom the Lord has or will get himself praise in the deliverance of
his people from them, and in the destruction of them, and in the
confessions they have been obliged to make of him, [Rev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md); these seem to be set in contrast
with the angels. The word is used for the great whales the Lord made,
which are thought to be the same with the "leviathan" of Job; of whom so
many things are said, which declare the power and wisdom of God in the
formation of it, [Gen 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021.md), &c. and
these may be put for the innumerable creatures in the sea, which in
their way show forth the praise and glory of God, [Psa
102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md); as "all deeps" do, deep
waters, especially the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants of them;
where the wonders of God are to be seen, and give occasion to those that
go down to the sea in ships to praise his name, [Psa
107:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md).

[Psalms 148:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 148:8</span></span>

Fire, and hail,.... These, and what follow in this verse, are in the
air, but are what are exhaled or drawn up from the earth or water;
"fire" is lightning, which is very swift in its motion, and powerful in
its effects; this is the fire which consumed Sodom and Gomorrah, and the
cities of the plain; which in Elijah's time came down and destroyed the
captains and their fifties; and which attended the Lord's appearance on
Mount Sinai; when "the voice of his thunder was in the heaven, the
lightnings lightened the world, and the earth trembled and shook", [Psa
77:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#018.md); and by which the power,
majesty, and glory of God are greatly displayed; see [Psa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md); "hail", which is water frozen in
the air and congealed; this was one of the plagues of Egypt; and with
hailstones many of the Canaanites were slain in the times of Joshua; and
by these God has shown his power, and has got himself praise from his
people by destroying their enemies, though they have blasphemed his name
on account of them, as they will when the great hailstorm of all shall
fall, [Rev 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021.md);

snow, and vapour; the former is a gift of God, and very beneficial to
the earth, and the cause of praise and thankfulness to God; See Gill on
[Psa 147:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016); the word (f.md) for "vapour"
signifies smoke, and is what rises out of the earth like smoke, as
Kimchi and Ben Melech observe; and is hot and dry, and forms lightnings
and winds, and has its place among things that occasion praise;

stormy wind fulfilling his word; which is raised up by a word of his
command; he creates it, brings it out of his treasures, holds it in his
lists, and lets it go out at his pleasure to fulfil his will; either, as
at some times in a way of mercy, as to dry up the waters of the flood,
to make a way for Israel through the Red sea, to bring quails to them in
the wilderness, and rain to the land of Israel in Ahab's time; and
sometimes in a way of judgment, to drown Pharaoh and his host in the Red
sea, to break the ships of Tarshish, to fetch Jonah the disobedient
prophet back, and to distress him afterwards; see [Psa
107:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#025.md); to do all this is an argument
of divine power, and a proof of deity, as it is of our Lord's, [Mat
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#027.md). The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin,
and Arabic versions, read it in the plural number, "which do his word";
referring it not to the stormy wind only, but to fire and hail, snow and
vapour; but the Hebrew text restrains it to the stormy wind.

[Psalms 148:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 148:9</span></span>

Mountains, and all hills,.... Which are originally formed by the Lord,
and set fast by his power and strength; these are the highest parts of
the earth, and are very ornamental and useful; they include all in them
and upon them, the trees and herbage that grow upon them, gold, silver,
brass, and iron in them; all very beneficial to mankind, and afford
matter of praise to God for them; see [Isa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012.md);

fruitful trees, and all cedars; trees bearing fruit are the fig trees,
pomegranates, vines, and olives, with which the land of Canaan abounded;
and such as bear lemons, oranges, plums, pears, apples, cherries, &c.
which produce fruit for the use, pleasure, and delight of man, and so a
means of praising God: and "cedars", the trees of the Lord which he hath
planted; though they bear no fruit, yet very useful in building, and
were of great service in the temple at Jerusalem; and which are put for
all others of like usefulness, and minister just occasion of praise; see
[Psa 96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 148:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 148:10</span></span>

Beasts, and all cattle,.... Wild and tame; the beasts of the field, and
the cattle on a thousand hills, which are all the Lord's, made,
supported, and supplied by him; he gives them their food and drink,
which they wait for and receive from him, and in their manner praise him
for the same; and these are useful to men for labour or for food, and
therefore should praise the Lord for them; see [Isa
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md);

creeping things, and flying fowl: of "creeping things" some belong to
the sea and others to the land; see [Psa
104:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#025.md); and there is not the least
creature on the sea or land, the meanest reptile or worthless worm, but
is of such exquisite workmanship as gives praise and glory to the
Creator; and so do every fly and every insect, as well as "flying fowl"
of the greatest size, as the eagle, vulture, &c. these, though they fly
in the air, had their original from the waters, [Gen
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 148:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 148:11</span></span>

Kings of the earth, and all people,.... The order of the creation is
pretty much observed throughout the whole of this account; and as man
was made last of all, so here he is called upon last to praise the Lord;
and the chief among men are begun with, "the kings of the earth", of the
several nations of the earth divided into kingdoms, over which some are
set as supreme: and these have reason to praise the Lord, who has raised
them to such dignity, for promotion comes not by chance, but by the
Lord, who sets up kings and puts them down at his pleasure; and also for
those gifts bestowed upon them, qualifying them for government, for it
is by him kings reign and princes decree justice; and likewise for the
preservation of them, for it is he that gives salvation to kings, and
continues them for usefulness, notwithstanding all plots and
conspiracies against them, [Psa 144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009.md);
see [Psa 75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006.md); "and all people"; their
subjects, as they should submit unto them and pray for them, so should
praise the Lord on their account, when they rule well, protect and
defend them in their persons, property, and liberties, [Pro
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#002.md);

princes, and all judges of the earth: the sons of kings, princes of the
blood, heirs of the crown; or nobles, ministers of state, counsellors,
and, all subordinate magistrates, who are in high places of honour,
profit, and trust, and so should praise the Lord, by whom they are
brought to such honour; and when they fill up their places, and
discharge their trust aright, the people have reason to be thankful for
them; and especially for the "judges of the earth", when they are men
fearing God and hating covetousness, and impartially minister justice
and judgment; see [Psa 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 148:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 148:12</span></span>

Both young men, and maidens,.... These should praise the Lord, the one
for their strength, the other for their beauty; and both should remember
their Creator in the days of their youth, and fear, serve, and worship
him; so they will praise and glorify him, as did Obadiah, Josiah,
Timothy, and the four daughters of Philip the evangelist;

old men, and children; the former have had a large experience of the
providential goodness of God, and, if good men, of the grace of God, and
are under great obligation to praise the Lord for all that he has done
for them; for they have known him that is from the beginning, and have
seen many of his wonderful works, which they should not forget to
declare to their children, to the honour and glory of God; and even out
of the mouth of "children", of babes and sucklings, who have less
knowledge, and less experience, God sometimes does ordain strength and
perfect praise to himself; see [Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md); compared with [Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md).

[Psalms 148:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 148:13</span></span>

Let them praise the name of the Lord, His nature and perfections, and
celebrate the glory of them; and his wonderful works, and the blessings
of his goodness, both of providence and grace; even all the above
creatures and things, celestial and terrestrial, for the following
reasons;

for his name alone is excellent; the name of the Lord is himself, who is
excellent in power, wisdom, goodness, truth, and faithfulness, and in
all other perfections of his nature; his works, by which he is known,
are excellent, both of nature and of grace, and proclaim his glory; his
Son, in whom his name is, and by whom he has manifested himself, is
excellent as the cedars; and so are all his precious names by which he
is called; and such is the Gospel, by which he is notified to the world:
nay, the Lord's name is alone excellent; all creature excellencies are
nothing in comparison of him, in heaven or in earth, those of angels and
men; and therefore should be praised by all, and above all;

his glory is above the earth and heaven; there is the glory of celestial
and terrestrial bodies, which differ; the glory of the sun, moon, and
stars, and of one star from another; but the glory of the divine Being,
the Creator of them, infinitely exceeds the glory of them all: his
glorious Majesty resides above heaven and earth; the heaven is the
throne be sits upon, and the earth the footstool he stands on; and
Christ, who is sometimes called his glory, and is the brightness of it,
[Psa 63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002.md); is exalted above every name
on earth, and is made higher than the heavens, and so is exalted above
all blessing and praise; see [Psa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 148:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 148:14</span></span>

He also exalteth the horn of his people,.... Which is done when he
increases their strength, their spiritual strength especially; makes
them strong in the Lord, in his grace, and in the power of his might;
when their dominion and authority is enlarged, and victory given over
all their enemies; particularly when the kingdom under the whole heaven
shall be given to them, and when they shall reign with Christ on earth;
for this phrase denotes the honourable as well as the safe state of the
people of God; the horn being an emblem of power, authority, and
dominion, on; the Targum renders it, the glory of his people; see [Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md). Some interpret this of Christ
the Horn of David, the Horn of salvation, and the author of it, [Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md); who is King over his people,
as a horn signifies; and is the strength, safety, and security of them;
has gotten them the victory over all their enemies, and is now exalted
in heaven at the right hand of God, and that "for his people" (g), as it
may be rendered; he is both raised up and exalted for them;

the praise of all his saints; that is, the Lord is the object of the
praise of all his saints, to whom he has showed favour and kindness, and
on whom he has bestowed the blessings of his grace; it is matter of
praise that they are saints, set apart by God the Father, sanctified by
the blood of Christ, and by the Spirit of God; and that their horn is
exalted, or they raised to dignity and honour; and that Christ is raised
and lifted up as an horn for them, [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md), [Luk
1:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068.md);

even of the children of Israel; not literal but spiritual Israel, such
who are Israelites indeed, whether Jews or Gentiles;

a people near unto him; in respect of union, being one with him, in the
bond of everlasting love; in respect of relation, being near akin, he
their father, they his children, not by creation only, but by adopting
grace; and Christ their near kinsman, nay, their father, brother, head,
and husband; in respect of access unto him, which they have through
Christ, with boldness and confidence, being made nigh and brought near
by the blood of Christ; in respect of communion and the enjoyment of his
gracious presence; and in respect of inhabitation, God, Father, Son, and
Spirit, dwelling in them, and making their abode with them: or, as it
may be rendered, "the people of his near one" (h); that is, of Christ,
who is near to God his Father, is one with him, was with him from
everlasting, was as one brought up with him, yea, lay in his bosom, drew
nigh to him as the surety of his people, and offered himself a sacrifice
to him as their Priest, and now is set down at his right hand as their
King; and where he also appears for them, is their advocate, and ever
lives to intercede for them;

praise ye the Lord: even all creatures, especially his saints, his
people, the children of Israel, the last spoken of.
