### [Hebrews Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS 9

The apostle having, in the former chapter, taken notice of the first
covenant, in this proceeds to show what belonged to it, that it had
service performed under it, and a place in which it was performed, [Heb
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md) and he begins with the latter,
which he distinguishes into two parts, and shows what was in each of
them; in the first, which was the holy place, were a candlestick, table,
and shewbread; in the second, which was the holiest of all, were a
golden censer, the ark of the covenant, the golden pot of manna, Aaron's
rod, the tables of the covenant, and the cherubim of glory overshadowing
the mercy seat, [Heb 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002.md). And next he
speaks of the service performed in these places; in the first, the holy
place, the common priests entered every day, doing service, as offering
sacrifice, &c. [Heb 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006.md) and in the
second, the holy of holies, only the high priest entered into, and that
but once a year, with blood of slain beasts, which he offered for his
own sins, and the sins of the people, [Heb
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md) and this being shut up, and
entered into but once a year, was an indication from the Holy Ghost,
that the way into the holiest of all, which this was then a figure of,
was not yet made manifest, while the tabernacle or temple was standing,
in which sacrifices were offered, which could not perfect the offerer of
them, or remove guilt from his conscience, [Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008.md) which shows the imperfection of
that priesthood, it consisting of meats, drinks, baptisms, and carnal
ordinances imposed on the Jewish nation until the times of the Messiah,
[Heb 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md) which are now come, and in
which there is an accomplishment of all those types and figures; Christ
was typified by the high priest; and he is come as such, and the good
things, the law was a shadow of, are come by him; who came into the
world by the assumption of human nature, a more perfect tabernacle than
the type of it was; and now having obtained eternal redemption for his
people, he is gone into heaven, the most holy place, not as the high
priest, with the blood of slain beasts, but with his own blood, [Heb
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011.md) the efficacy of which blood is
argued from the lesser to the greater, that if the blood of beasts, and
water of separation, sanctified and purified externally, then much more
must the blood of Christ purge the conscience from sin, that it may
serve God, since Christ offered himself to God without spot, through the
eternal Spirit, [Heb 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md). The
necessity of Christ's shedding his blood, or of his death, is proved
from his being the Mediator of the new covenant, which required the
redemption of transgressions under the first testament, that called ones
might have the promise of the eternal inheritance, [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md). And this is reasoned from the
nature of testaments or wills among men, which make the death of the
testator necessary, they being of no force while he lives, only after
his death, [Heb 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md). And this is
further illustrated by the first testament being dedicated by blood, and
everything belonging to it purged by it, the book, the people, the
tabernacle, and all the vessels of it; nor is there any remission of
sin, whether typical or real, without shedding of blood, [Heb
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018.md) wherefore, as it was necessary
that the patterns and types of heavenly things should be purified in
this manner; it must be more so, that the antitypes should be purified
with better sacrifices, even with the sacrifice of Christ, [Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023.md) and accordingly Christ is entered
into heaven itself, of which the holy places in the tabernacle were
figures, there to present and plead his sacrifice on account of his
people, [Heb 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md) not that it was
necessary that he should offer up himself again, or often, as the high
priest, his type, went every year into the holy place with the blood of
others; for then he must have often suffered since the world began, of
which there was no need, since his appearing once in the end of the
world, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, is sufficient, [Heb
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#025.md) for as it is the appointment of
God, that men should die but once, and then come to judgment, so it was
only necessary that Christ should be offered once to bear the sins of
all his people, and then appear a second time without any sin at all
upon him, to the salvation of those that look for him, [Heb
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027.md).

[Hebrews 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 9:1</span></span>

Then verily the first covenant had ordinances of divine service,.... The
design of the apostle in this chapter, as it stands in connection with
what goes before, is to show the pre-eminence of Christ, from the
tabernacle, and the things in it; as well as from the priesthood and
covenant; and as also the abrogation of the Levitical ceremonies in
particular, as well as the first covenant in general; and that they were
all types and figures of Christ, and had their fulfilment in him: the
word "first", here used, designs not the tabernacle, but the covenant;
therefore it is rightly thus supplied in our version, as it is in the
Arabic and Ethiopic versions: which is said to have "ordinances of
divine service"; belonging to the service of God, which was performed
both by the priests, and by the people; and these ordinances were no
other than the carnal ordinances, or rites of the ceremonial law: the
word used signifies "righteousnesses"; and they are so called, because
they were appointed by a righteous God; and were imposed on the people
of the Jews in a righteous way; and by them men became externally and
typically righteous; for they were figures and types of justification by
the righteousness of Christ, though no complete, perfect, real
righteousness, came by them.

And a worldly sanctuary. Philo the Jew says (l), it was a type of the
world, and of the various things in it; though it was rather either a
type of the church, or of heaven, or of Christ's human nature: the
better reason of its being so called is, because it consisted of earthly
matter, and worldly things; it was in the world, and only had its use in
the world, and so is opposed to the heavenly sanctuary; for the Jews
often speak of , "a sanctuary above", and , "a sanctuary below" (m), and
of , "a tabernacle above", and , "a tabernacle below" (n); which
answered to one another: the words may be rendered "a beautiful
sanctuary", a well adorned one; and such especially was the temple, or
sanctuary built by Solomon, rebuilt by Zerubbabel, and repaired and
adorned by Herod, [Luk 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005.md). And the
Jews say, that he that never saw Herod's building, meaning the temple,
never saw a beautiful building; see [Luk
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005.md).

[Hebrews 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 9:2</span></span>

For there was a tabernacle made,.... By the direction of Moses,
according to the pattern showed him in the Mount:

the first; that is, the first part of the tabernacle, called the holy
place, in distinction from the holy of holies, which was the second part
of the tabernacle; for otherwise there were not a first and a second
tabernacle; there never was but one tabernacle:

wherein was the candlestick; that this was in the tabernacle, and on the
south side of it, and without the vail, where the apostle has placed it,
is plain from [Exo 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#035.md). This was
wanting in the second temple (o): it was a type of Christ mystical, or
the church; in the general use of it, to hold forth light, so the church
holds forth the light of the Gospel, being put into it by Christ; in the
matter of it, which was pure gold, denoting the purity, worth,
splendour, glory, and duration of the church; in the parts of it, it had
one shaft in the middle of it, in which all the parts met and cemented,
typical of Christ the principal, and head of the church, whose situation
is in the midst of the church, and who unites all together, and is but
one: the six branches of it may intend all the members of the church,
and especially the ministers of the word; the seven lamps with oil in
them, may have a respect to the seven spirits of God, or the Spirit of
God with his gifts and graces, and a profession of religion with grace
along with it: and it was typical of the church in its ornaments and
decorations; its bowls, knops, and flowers, may signify the various
gifts of the Spirit, beautifying ministers, and fitting them for
usefulness; and in the appurtenances of it, the tongs and snuff dishes
may signify church discipline, censures, and excommunications.

And the table and the shewbread; the table, with the shewbread on it,
was also in the tabernacle, on the north side of it, and without the
vail, [Exo 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#035.md). This was also
wanting in the second temple (p): the table was typical of Christ, and
of communion with him; of the person of Christ; in the matter of it,
which was Shittim wood overlaid with gold, whereby were signified the
two natures of Christ in one person; the human nature by the Shittim
wood, which is incorruptible, for though he died he saw no corruption,
and is risen again, and lives for ever; and the divine nature by the
gold, all the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him; and in the
decorations of it, as the border, golden crown, &c. which may respect
the fulness of his grace, and the honour and glory he is crowned with,
which render him exceeding valuable and precious: and it may be typical
of communion with him, either hereafter, when the saints shall sit with
him as at a table, and eat and drink with him in the kingdom of his
Father; or here, to which Christ admits them, and than which nothing is
more honourable, comfortable, and desirable; and it may be significative
of the ministration of the word and ordinances, of which Christ is the
sum and substance, and in which he grants his people fellowship with
him: to this table belonged rings and bars to carry it from place to
place, which was done by the priests; where the church is, there Christ
is, and there is the ministration of his word and ordinances; and which
are sometimes moved from one place to another, by the ministers of the
word, according to divine direction. The "shewbread", on the table, was
typical either of the church of Christ, the saints, who may be signified
by the unleavened cakes, being true and sincere, and without the leaven
of malice and hypocrisy; and by twelve of them, which may represent the
twelve tribes of Israel, the whole spiritual Israel of God; and by bread
of faces, as the word for shewbread may be rendered, since they are
always before the Lord, and his eyes are continually upon them; they are
set upon the pure table, Christ, on whom they are safe, and by whom they
are accepted with God: and the shewbread being set in rows, may denote
their order and harmony; and their being removed every sabbath day, may
signify the succession of saints in the church, as one is removed,
another is brought in; and the frankincense put upon each row, shows
them to be a sweet savour to God: or else the shewbread was typical of
Christ himself, who is the bread of life, the food of his people; and
may be signified by the shewbread for its fineness and purity, being
made of fine flour, Christ is the finest of the wheat, bread from
heaven, and angels' food; for its quantity, twelve cakes, with Christ,
is bread enough, and to spare, for all the elect; for its continuance,
Christ always abides, and such as feed upon him live for ever; for its
gratefulness, Christ's flesh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed;
and for its being only for the priests, as only such who are made
priests to God, live by faith on Christ; see [Lev
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#005.md). Moreover, the intercession of
Christ may be prefigured by the shewbread, or bread of faces, he being
the angel of God's presence or face, who appears in the presence of God
for his people; and this consisting of twelve loaves, according to the
number of the tribes of Israel, shows that Christ represents the whole
Israel of God in heaven, and intercedes for them; and whereas the
shewbread always continued, no sooner was one set of loaves removed, but
another was put in their room; this may point at the continual
intercession of Christ for his people; and the frankincense may denote
the acceptableness of it to God.

Which is called the sanctuary; or "holy"; this refers either to the
first part of the tabernacle, which was called the holy place, in which
the priests in common ministered; or else to the things which were in
it, now mentioned, the candlestick table, and shewbread; to which the
Ethiopic version adds, and the golden censer, which it leaves out in the
fourth verse; which version renders these words, "and these they call
holy"; and so the Arabic version, "which are called holy things", as
they were, as well as the place in which they were; so the candlestick
is called the holy candlestick in the Apocrypha,

"As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is the beauty of
the face in ripe age.'' (Sirach 26:17)

and the ark, candlestick, table, censer, and altar, are called "holy
vessels", by Philo the Jew (q); but the former sense seems best, when
compared with the following verse.

[Hebrews 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 9:3</span></span>

And after the second vail,.... Were there more vails than one? the
Scripture speaks but of one, [Exo
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md) there was indeed an hanging for
the door of the tent, but that is not called a vail; nor was there more
than one vail in the tabernacle, nor in the temple of Solomon; but in
the second temple, under which the apostle lived, there were two vails,
which divided between the holy place, and the holy of holies; and the
innermost of these the apostle means: and so the Jewish writers (r)
constantly affirm, that there were two vails between the said places,
and that two new ones were made every year (s). So on the day of
atonement, when the high priest went into the most holy place, with the
incense, it is said (t), that

"he walked in the temple till he came between , "the two vails", which
divide between the holy, and holy of holies, and there was the space of
a cubit between them.''

The reason of these two vails may be seen in the account Maimonides
gives of this matter (u):

"in the first temple there was a wall which divided between the holy,
and holy of holies, the thickness of a cubit; but when they built the
second temple, it was doubted by them, whether the thickness of the wall
was of the measure of the holy place, or of the measure of the holy of
holies; wherefore they made the holy of holies twenty cubits complete,
and the holy place forty cubits complete, and they left the space of a
cubit between the holy, and the holy of holies; and they did not build a
wall in the second temple, but they made , "two vails", one on the side
of the holy of holies, and the other on the side of the holy place, and
between them a cubit answerable to the thickness of the wall, which was
in the first temple; but in the first temple there was but one vail
only, as it is said, [Exo 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033.md) and
the vail shall divide unto you, &c.''

And to this account other Jewish writers (w) agree; and the space
between the two vails is called by them (x), from the trouble and
perplexity this affair gave them. This vail, or vails, might represent
the sin of man, which separates between God and men, excludes from
heaven; but is removed by the death of Christ, when the vail was rent in
twain; so that now there is an open way to heaven; Christ has entered
into it by his own blood; and saints have boldness to enter there by
faith and hope now, and shall hereafter personally enter into it: or
else this vail may signify the ceremonial law, which separated between
Jew and Gentile, and is abolished by the death of Christ: or rather it
was typical of the flesh, or human nature of Christ, called the vail of
his flesh, [Heb 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020.md). Now within this
second vail was

the tabernacle, or that part of it, the second part,

which is called the holiest of all; which was either typical of Christ,
who is called the most Holy, [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)
he being so in both natures, divine and human; or of heaven, for the
holy places, made with hands, were figures of heaven, [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md) for its holiness, it being the
habitation of the holy God, holy angels, and spirits of just men made
perfect; and for its invisibility, and the unseen things which faith and
hope, which enter within the vail, are the evidence of; and for the
things that are in it, typified by the following ones.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 9:4</span></span>

Which had the golden censer,.... There were various censers used by the
priests in the daily service, but this was a peculiar one, which was
used by the high priest on the day of atonement; on other days he used a
silver censer, but on that day a golden one, and with it he entered into
the holy of holies (y); and though Moses does not call it a golden one,
[Lev 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012) yet Josephus does (z.md); and
so do the Jewish doctors in the place referred to, with whom the apostle
agrees, and to this the allusion is in [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md) but here a difficulty arises, how
this can be said to have been in the holy of holies, and within the
vail, when, according to Moses, it was without the vail, and was only
carried within on the day of atonement; and so Philo the Jew (a) places
it in the other part of the tabernacle; and it seems as if it was to
avoid this difficulty, that the Ethiopic version has removed it from
this verse to verse the second, and put it among the things that were in
the holy place; but there is no need of this, nor to say that the altar
of incense is intended, for that is never so called, and, besides, was
without the vail too. It should be observed, that the apostle does not
say, that the golden censer was laid up in the holy of holies, and kept
there, but that it "had" it; as it had it on the day of atonement, when
it was carried in there by the high priest, who there made use of it;
and it was for the use of it in that place, that it was peculiarly
designed. What was done by it was this, burning coals were with it taken
off from the altar before the Lord, and were brought in within the vail,
where incense was put upon them, which covered the mercy seat, that so
the high priest died not. The burning coals signify the very great
sufferings of Christ, not only the sufferings of his body, which were
very painful, but those of his soul, when the wrath and hot displeasure
of God was poured out upon him; and those coals being taken off from the
altar before the Lord, show that the sufferings of Christ were according
to the will of God, were grateful to him, and always before him; and
their being brought within the vail, does not denote that Christ is now
in a suffering state, though he is in the midst of the throne, as a lamb
that had been slain; but the continued virtue and efficacy of his
sufferings, and that our faith and hope, which enter within the vail,
have to do with his blood and sacrifice thither carried. And the
incense, which was carried in with those coals, typified the
intercession of Christ in heaven, which is pure and holy, sweet,
fragrant, and perpetual; and the priest having his hands full of it,
expresses the fulness of Christ's intercession for all his elect, and
for all things for them, and his fulness of merit to plead, which makes
his intercession efficacious and prevalent; and hence, through his much
incense, the prayers of his people become odorous and acceptable: and
the incense being put upon the burning coals in the censer, shows that
Christ's intercession proceeds upon the foot of his blood and sacrifice,
his sufferings and death; and hence it becomes grateful, and has its
influence; the smoke of it covers the mercy seat, or throne of grace,
and makes that accessible; and as the priest, who offers it, never dies,
so none of those for whom he intercedes.

And the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold; this is
called the ark of the covenant, because the tables of the covenant,
afterwards mentioned, were put into it; and that it was overlaid with
gold round about, is certain from [Exo
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#011.md) where it is said to be overlaid
with pure gold, within and without; and that the ark was within the
vail, and in the most holy place, is manifest from [Exo
40:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#021.md) that this was wanting in the
second temple, is generally agreed (b); but who took it away, where it
was put, or what became of it various are the sentiments of the Jewish
writers: some say (c), it was carried away by Nebuchadnezzar into
Babylon, and is meant by the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord,
[Ch2 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010) others say (d.md), that
Jeremiah the prophet took it, and hid it in a cave on Mount Nebo; but
the more generally received opinion is, that it was hid by King Josiah
in some hidden and deep place, which Solomon had built for that purpose
under ground, knowing, that the temple would be destroyed (e); and it is
often said, that it was hid under the pavement of a room in the temple,
called , "the wood room" (f). The ark is, by some, thought to be a type
of the church, which is the ark of God, of his building, and where he
dwells; the ark of the covenant, or testimony, where the oracles of God,
his word and ordinances, are: its being made of Shittim wood may denote
the incorruption and duration of it: and its being covered with gold
within and without is expressive of its glory; and its being portable,
and carried from place to place, shows that the church is not always in
one place; its rings, staves, and priests that bore it, may point at the
Gospel, and the ministers of it, the instruments of moving it; and its
moving from place to place, and falling into the hands of enemies, were
emblematical of the church's afflictions; as its rest at last, in
Solomon's temple, may signify the church's rest here and hereafter: but
the ark is rather to be considered as a type of Christ; its various
names agree with Christ, as the ark of God, the ark of his strength, the
glory of God, the face of God, the holy ark, the ark of the covenant, or
testimony, yea, Jehovah, and God himself: the time of its making is
observable, it was made before the tabernacle, and the tabernacle for
the sake of it; Christ is before all creatures, and was set up as
Mediator before anything existed, and all things are for his sake; it
being made of Shittim wood, covered with gold, may denote both the
incorruption and glory of Christ; and its several decorations, the
graces with which he was adorned, as man and Mediator; its staves and
rings may design the word, ordinances, and ministers, whereby he is
carried into the several places of the world; here God granted his
presence, and counsel was asked of him, and it was brought forth in time
of war, as a security from enemies, all which is applicable to Christ;
by it wonders were done, as the dividing of Jordan for the Israelites to
pass into the land of Canaan, the falling of the walls of Jericho, and
the fall of Dagon; so Christ has opened the way for his people to
heaven, has spoiled principalities and powers, and his Gospel is
powerful to the pulling down the strongholds of sin and Satan; the
moving of the ark from place to place, and its rest in the temple, may
signify the rest of Christ, after his many fatigues in this world.

Wherein was the golden pot that had manna; which Aaron filled with manna
by the direction of Moses, who gave it at the appointment of God, that
it might be preserved to future ages, as a memorial of the goodness,
care, and power of God in feeding the Israelites with it in the
wilderness, [Exo 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#033.md). This pot held
an omer, which was more than three pints and a half; some say six pints:
and though Moses does not call it a golden pot, yet it is so called, not
only by the Septuagint in [Exo 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#033.md)
but also by Philo the Jew (g); nor is it reasonable to think, with some
Jewish writers (h), that it should be made of earth, which was to
continue for ages to come: this also was wanting in the second temple
(i); and this, with Aaron's rod, after mentioned, and other things, is
said to be hid when the ark was, and along with it (k): but how this
pot, as well as Aaron's rod, can be said to be in the ark, when it is
asserted, at the bringing of the ark into the temple, at the dedication
of it by Solomon, that there was nothing in it but two tables of stone,
[Kg1 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009.md) and both the pot of "manna",
and Aaron's rod, are said to be before the testimony, [Exo
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#034.md) and not in it, is a difficulty.
Some, in order to remove it, observe, that the phrase, "wherein", refers
not to the ark, but to the tabernacle; but since the tables of the
covenant were in the ark, and these are mentioned with it, and the
phrase, "over it", in the next verse, cannot be understood of the
tabernacle, but of the ark, this solution is not satisfactory. Others
have observed, that they might be in the ark in Moses's time and in
Jeremiah's time, when they are said to be hid, though they were not in
Solomon's: and others have taken notice, that the preposition sometimes
signifies "at", or "with", as in [Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md) and so the sense is, that these
were near unto it in the most holy place, and might be in the sides of
it, though not within it; for there were places in the sides of the ark
to put things into, [Deu 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026.md). And
certain it is from the above account from Scripture, that they were near
it; and so, by the Jewish writers, they are always mentioned along with
it: when that was carried away, and hid, they were hid with it; but what
a certain Jewish commentator (l) observes on [Kg1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009.md) is so express, as if it was
designed to vindicate our apostle: his remark is this:

"the intention of this is not to deny that there were not the things
mentioned in the law, for they were , "left in it", as Aaron's "rod",
and "the pot of manna", only to deny, hereby, that there was not
anything of the law, save the decalogue.''

And it should be observed, that it is not said of these, that they were
put before the ark, but "before the testimony"; that is, before the
tables of the covenant, which were within the ark. The "manna", in this
pot, was typical of Christ; in the signification of its name, whether it
comes from "manah", which signifies to appoint, prepare, and distribute,
Christ being appointed, prepared, and distributed, as food for his
people; or from , "man hu", what is it? the words said by the
Israelites, when they first saw it, not knowing what it was; so Christ
is unknown to his people until revealed to them, and remains unknown to
all natural and unregenerate men: the manna came from heaven, from God,
and was a free gift of his, and so Christ: it was round in form, and may
be expressive of Christ's perfection, and eternity: it was in colour
white, which may signify his purity and innocence; it was sweet in
taste, and so is Christ, his fruits, his word and ordinances: it was
small in quantity, which may denote the meanness and despicableness of
Christ in the eyes of the world: the people went out and gathered it,
and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and baked it, and ate,
which may be typical of the apprehension, sufferings, and death of
Christ, in order to be fit food for the faith of believers. The persons
that were fed by it were the Israelites, who were brought out of Egypt,
and then in the wilderness, a large number, and men of all sorts, rich,
and poor, and who had an equal portion, though very undeserving; so
those who are fed by Christ, and nourished with him, the bread of life,
are the spiritual Israel of God, whom Christ has redeemed from worse
than Egyptian bondage and darkness, though they are yet in the
wilderness of this world; and they are a large number, the whole family
of God, who receive out of Christ's fulness grace for grace; and there
is no difference of high and low, rich and poor, bond or free, male or
female; they are all one in Christ, and Christ is all in all; and they
have all a whole Christ, though they are very undeserving, being by
nature children of wrath as others. And as the Israelites had the manna
every day, and all the while they were in the wilderness, so Christ is
the daily bread of believers; by him, in his word and ordinances, is his
church nourished in the wilderness, to whom he gives to eat of the
hidden manna, the food of the wilderness. The "pot", in which this manna
was kept, was typical of the ordinances of the Gospel; in its matter,
being made of gold, denoting the preciousness and duration of them; in
the size of it, holding an "omer", showing that these contain plenty of
good things to satisfaction; in the situation of it before the ark,
signifying the presence of Christ with his ordinances; and in its use to
hold manna, and be a memorial of it to ages to come, as the ordinances
have in them food for souls, and are the means of remembering Christ in
future generations, till his second coming.

And Aaron's rod that budded; and not only budded, but bloomed;
blossomed, and yielded almonds, [Num
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008.md). This also was laid before the
ark of the testimony, [Heb 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md), and
may be said to be in it, or with it, in the same sense as the pot of
manna was; it was likewise wanting in the second temple (m), and is said
to be hid with the pot of manna, and other things, as before observed:
it was a type of Christ: it is affirmed by the Jews, that in the days of
the Messiah, the priesthood shall return, and the rod of Aaron shall
flourish (n); it was, very probably, as some have thought (o), an almond
tree stick, as that in [Jer 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#011.md). The
almond tree has its name, in Hebrew, from a word which signifies haste
and vigilance; it being, as Pliny says (p), the first of trees that buds
and blossoms, and is very hasty in putting them forth. An almond tree
rod may be a proper emblem of Christ's speedy incarnation in the fulness
of time; and Aaron's almond tree rod, of his right to the priesthood,
and his vigilance in it: this was first a dry rod or stick, and may
design the mean descent and appearance of Christ, being born of mean
parents, living a mean and obscure life; his entrance on his public
ministry, and continuance in it, were without any pomp or grandeur; he
was as a root out of a dry ground; and though he did many miracles,
these were treated with contempt; and he was at last apprehended,
arraigned, and condemned as a malefactor, and died a shameful and an
accursed death: it looked very unlikely and unpromising, that he should
be the King Messiah; that he should have all power in heaven and in
earth; that he should have the wisdom he had, and do the miracles he
did; and that he should be the author of eternal salvation; and that
such fruits of grace, peace, pardon, and righteousness, should spring
from him, as that Aaron's dry rod should bud, blossom, and bear almonds,
in which it was a lively figure of Christ; that lying among other rods,
and perhaps being like them, may denote Christ's assuming the common
nature of men, or an individual of human nature in all things like to
man: and this being cut off from the tree, and being a dry stick, may
represent the death of Christ; and its budding and blossoming may point
at the resurrection of Christ from the dead; and as Aaron's priesthood
was confirmed by the budding and blossoming of his rod, so the deity and
Messiahship of Christ are confirmed by his resurrection; and its
bringing forth almonds may design the fruits of Christ's death and
resurrection; and moreover, the almond tree being, as Philo the Jew says
(q) the first of trees that buds and blossoms in the spring, and the
last that casts its leaves, it may be, as he observes, a symbol of the
priestly tribe; and it may be a figure of the perpetuity of Christ, and
his priesthood:

and the tables of the covenant; the same with the testimony which was
ordered to be put into the ark, and accordingly was, [Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016.md). About this there is no
controversy; though it is a matter of dispute with the Jews, whether the
book of the law was in the ark or not: some say it was in the side of
it, and others within it (r); but Maimonides (s) says, that Moses wrote
the whole law with his own hand before he died, and gave a book (or
copy) to every tribe, and one copy he put "in the ark": so Jarchi says
(t), that the book of the law of Moses was put into the midst of the
ark, and the ark was glorious and beautiful by that which was "within
it". These tables were made of stone, an emblem of the hardness of man's
heart, which is destitute of spiritual life and motion, senseless and
stupid, impenitent, stubborn, and inflexible, and on which no
impressions can be made but by powerful and efficacious grace; and also
of the stability and duration of the law, as moral, which is not
antiquated by another, nor made void by the Gospel, nor altered in its
nature and terms, but remains the same as to the matter of it; though it
is now no covenant of works to believers, and they are freed from the
curse and condemnation of it: the number of these tables is two; the
whole law is reduced by our Lord to two grand precepts of it, [Mat
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037.md) and the fleshly tables, on which
it is reinscribed in regeneration, are the heart and mind, [Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003.md). The place where these tables were
put is the ark, which was typical of the law being in Christ, not only
in his hands, but in his heart, [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md) and in his keeping of which he is
the fulfilling end; for he being the surety of his people, and becoming
man, answered every part of the law; in the holiness of his nature, in
the perfect obedience of his life, and in his sufferings and death, in
which he bore the penalty of it: and these tables are called the tables
of the covenant, because the law on Mount Sinai was a covenant made with
the people of Israel; and was typical of the covenant, of which Christ
is the surety and Mediator, and which is ratified by his blood.

[Hebrews 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 9:5</span></span>

And over it the cherubim of glory,.... Or "glorious cherubim", where the
Shechinah, or divine glory, dwelt, [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md). These were over the ark, and
were in number two, as were the cherubim which God placed at the garden
of Eden, [Gen 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024.md) according to the
opinion of the ancient Jews (u); and very likely these were made after
the form of them. Some have thought them to be birds of a very terrible
aspect, which were set there to deter Adam and Eve from coming to the
tree of life; and both Philo (w) and Josephus (x) say, they were winged
fowls; but the generality of the Jewish writers take them for angels
(y); and some of them say they were destroying angels, or noxious
spirits (z), which is not probable; but why angels should be so called,
and what was their appearance, there are different opinions. Jerom says
(a) the word signifies a multitude of knowledge; and indeed Philo the
Jew (b) observes, that the Greeks would interpret the Hebrew word, much
knowledge and understanding; and another Jewish writer (c) affirms, that
the word "cherubim" is a name for separate intelligences, as if angels
were so called from their great knowledge, and that the word is the same
as "cerabbim", as "Rabbins", doctors, or teachers; but for the most part
they interpret it, "as young men" (d), because that angels have appeared
in the form of young men. So in the Talmud (e) it is asked,

"what does cherub signify?" says R. Abhu, "as a young man", for so in
Babylon they call a young man ''

Some think that the word "cherub" is the same with "Recub", the letters
transposed, which signifies "a chariot", because God is said to ride
upon a "cherub" and the angels are called the chariots of the Lord, [Psa
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md) to which may be added, that
Ezekiel's vision of the "cherubim" is frequently, by the Jews (f),
called "Mercabah", or "the chariot"; and mention is made of the chariot
of the cherubim, in [Ch1 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018.md) to
which reference may be had in [Hab 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#008.md)
though I rather think, with others, that the word is derived from
"Carab", which in the Syriac and Arabic languages signifies "to plough",
and so in the Talmud (g); and a cherub took its name from hence, because
of the ox, whose face it had, that being a creature made use of in
ploughing; and that the face of an ox, and the face of a cherub, is the
same, may easily be concluded from [Eze
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md). And now because that Ezekiel's
cherubim had four faces, the face of a man, the face of a lion, the face
of an ox, and the face of an eagle; and the "cherubim" in the temple
were in the same form, as may be gathered from [Eze
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#018.md) those that were placed at the
garden of Eden may be thought to be in the same form also: and some of
late have fancied, that they were an hieroglyphic of the trinity of
persons in the Godhead, signified by the ox, the lion, and eagle; and of
the incarnation of the Son of God, the face of a man being added to
them; to support which notion it is further observed, that the word
should be pronounced "ce-rubbim", and interpreted, "as the mighty ones".
But it should be known, that the word is also used in the singular
number, [Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md) and every single
cherub had these four faces, so that each of them must be a
representative of the Trinity, and of the incarnate Saviour, of which
only the word in the singular number can be used; and then it can only
be said of it, "cerub", as "the mighty one" which observation greatly
weakens what is brought to support the fancy: besides, if the cherubim
were an emblem of a plurality of persons in the Godhead, they would
rather be an emblem of a quaternity, and not of a trinity of persons,
since each had four faces, and those distinct from each other; for the
face of a man is as much a distinct face as any of the rest. Now the
human nature of Christ is no distinct person, much less one in the
Godhead; and besides is the inferior nature of Christ, whereas the face
of the man, in the "cherubim", is superior to the rest, which are the
faces of irrational animals. Moreover, this would give us a similitude
of the divine Being, and of that in him which is most incomprehensible
by us, the trinity of persons in the Godhead; and so an answer may be
given to such questions, the sense of which suggests, that no answer can
be returned to them, [Isa 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018.md) and
though the second Person often appeared in human form, and in the
fulness of time became incarnate, and the Holy Ghost once descended as a
dove, yet the Father's shape was never seen at any time, [Joh
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037.md) to which may be added, that this
notion seems contrary to the second command, "thou shall not make unto
thee any likeness of anything that is in heaven above", [Exo
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004.md) for allowing that the cherubim at
the garden of Eden were figures made by the Lord himself, it is not
credible he should make such, he afterwards forbid others to make;
besides, the "cherubim" in the tabernacle and temple were the same
figures with those in Eden, as is owned; and these were ordered of God
to be made by men, and therefore surely cannot be thought to be figures,
emblems, and representations of God himself in his three divine persons;
likewise the cherubim are not only distinguished from him, but instead
of being figures of him, they are always represented as vehicles on
which he sits or rides, [Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md).
Once more, it may deserve some little consideration, that the prince of
Tyre, a type of antichrist, the man of sin, is called a "cherub", [Eze
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014.md) which surely cannot be in
allusion to the divine Being, and the persons in the Godhead, but very
well in allusion to angels, the sons of God, as civil magistrates, good
and bad, are sometimes called. No doubt there was something signified by
the "cherubim" in the tabernacle and temple; but that this should be the
mystery of them, is not easy of belief. Philo the Jew makes the
"cherubim" to signify the two powers of God, his creative and governing
powers (h); and the Jews frequently speak of , "the mystery of the
cherubim" (i): the "cherubim" over the ark, here spoken of, are
sometimes allegorized of the two Testaments, the Old and New; the matter
of them being of gold may denote the excellency, purity, simplicity, and
duration of them; their number is two, as were the "cherubim"; and as
they were alike, and of one measure and size, this may intend the
agreement between them; the doctrines, promises, prophecies, types, and
figures of the Old Testament agree with the New; and the account that
the one gives of the person and offices, and grace of Christ, agrees
with the other; their situation and position, being placed at the two
ends of the mercy seat, and looking towards it, may denote their being
full of Christ, from one end to the other, and their pointing at him,
and bearing witness to him; here God also reveals himself, as he did
between the "cherubim"; and these are glorious as they were, full of
glory, containing the glorious Gospel of the blessed God: though rather
the "cherubim" on the mercy seat were symbols and representations of
angels, since to these the Apostle Peter seems to allude, in [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md), their being made of gold may
denote their excellency, purity, and simplicity; their being on the
mercy seat shows their dependence on Christ, their confirmation by him,
and ministration to him; their having wings, expresses their readiness
to do his will; and their looking one to another, signifies their unity
and concord among themselves; and their looking to the mercy seat, their
inspection into the mysteries of grace; and their being over the ark,
and God being in the midst of them, declares the presence of God with
them, whose face they always behold; and as these "cherubim" of glory,
they are very glorious creatures, and in the glory of them will Christ
come a second time:

shadowing the mercy seat; that is, with their wings, as in [Exo
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020.md) which was typical of Christ; its
name agrees with him, a mercy seat; for in him God shows himself
merciful to his people; all the stores of mercy are laid up in him; the
mission of him into this world is owing to the mercy of God; and the
mercy of God was glorified by him in the redemption of his people; and
he himself is the way through which they obtain and receive mercy; and
he is also a merciful high priest to them: the Hebrew word for the mercy
seat, signifies "a covering": nor is our English word in sound very
different from it; and it was so called, as Kimchi (k) observes, because
it covered the ark: Christ is a covering to his people; their persons
are clothed with his righteousness, and all their sins are covered by
it; and they are secured from the curse and condemnation of the law, and
wrath to come: the Septuagint interpreters render it by the word used
here by the Apostle Paul, in [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md), there rendered "propitiation",
and applied to Christ, who has made reconciliation for sin, and through
whom God is propitious to his people. The matter, of which the mercy
seat was made, was pure gold, denoting the excellency and preciousness
of Christ; the make of it, in its length and breadth, was just the same
with the ark, in which the two tables were, [Exo
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010.md). Christ is the fulfilling end of
the law, and exactly answers to all its requirements; his nature, to the
holiness and spirituality of it; his righteousness, to all the obedience
it commands; and his sufferings and death, to the penalty it enjoins:
its situation above the ark shows that there is no mercy but in a way of
righteousness, and that Christ stands between God and the law, and, by
fulfilling it, covers all the transgressions of it; and being above it,
is able to suppress all its accusations and charges: from off the mercy
seat, God communed with his people; the way to communion with God is by
Christ; the encouragement to go to God is from him; and the enjoyment of
him is through him: on the day of atonement the mercy seat was sprinkled
with blood, typical of the blood of Christ, whereby peace is made, and a
way opened into the holiest of all:

of which we cannot now speak particularly; not only of the mercy seat,
but of all the things before mentioned; for the word "which" is in the
plural number, and refers to all the preceding things; to discourse of
which, largely and particularly, required more time than the apostle
had, and must have exceeded the bounds of an epistle. The Ethiopic
version renders it in the singular number; "of this".

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 9:6</span></span>

Now when these things were thus ordained,.... Or prepared and got ready;
that is, when the tabernacle was finished, and set up, and provided with
all its vessels and furniture:

the priests went always into the first tabernacle; the first part of the
tabernacle, which was called the holy place, [Heb
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002.md) here the common priests went
continually every day, morning and evening; the Syriac and Ethiopic
versions read, "the outward tabernacle", in distinction from the
innermost part of the tabernacle, or the most holy place:

accomplishing the service of God; by offering sacrifices, burning
incense, and trimming the lamps, which they did every day: the priests
entered into the holy place every day for service; but they might not go
in at any other time but the time of service (l) the phrase, "of God",
is not in the text, but is a supplement; and it was usual with the Jews
to call the worship of the temple, and especially that part of it which
lay in sacrifices, "the service": Simeon the just used to say, the world
stands upon three things; upon the law, , "and upon the service", and
upon beneficence (m); by "the service", the commentators (n) on the
passage understand sacrifices; and again it is said (o), no man enters
into the court "for service", though he is clean, until he has dipped
himself: the word here used in the Greek text is in the plural number,
and may be rendered the services, because there were several sorts of
services performed every day, as before observed, and several sacrifices
offered; and the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "the offices of
sacrifices"; and the Ethiopic version, "their offerings"; and the Arabic
version, "offices": and the service which the high priest performed in
the holiest of all once a year, was divers, which is mentioned in the
following verses, and is called "service", [Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008.md) it is said, that on the day of
atonement there were five "services" of the morning daily sacrifice (p),
in which the high priest ministered in his golden garments: but here the
service of the common priests is meant, which was every day; and it
becomes such who are employed in sacred service; both to be constant in
it, and to do it fully and completely.

[Hebrews 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 9:7</span></span>

Though this is not expressed in so many words in [Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md) only it is said that "Aaron came
not at all times into the holy place within the vail"; yet it is the
constant and generally received sense of the Jewish writers, in
agreement with the apostle here, that the high priest went into the holy
of holies but once a year (q), on the day of atonement, which was on the
tenth of the month Tisri, and answers to part of September; not but that
he went in more than once on that day, for he went in no less than four
times (r); the first time he went in to offer incense; the second time
with the blood of the bullock, to sprinkle it; the third time with the
blood of the goat; and the fourth time to bring out the censer (s); and
if he entered a fifth time, they say he was worthy of death; wherefore
Philo the Jew (t) seems to be mistaken when he affirms that, if he went
in three or four times on the same day, he suffered death, nor was there
any pardon for him; and as it was but one day in a year he might enter,
so when he did, no other man, either Israelite or priest, might go in
along with him; he went in alone without any attendance: the Jews say
(u), that a cord or thong was bound to the feet of the high priest when
he went into the holy of holies, that if he died there, the rest might
be able to draw him out; for it was not lawful for another priest to go
in, no, not an high priest, none besides him on the day of atonement.
Pausanias (w) makes mention of a temple of Minerva into which the
priests entered once every year; which very likely was observed in
imitation of this custom of the Jewish high priest; who in it was a type
of Christ, and of his entrance into heaven, and of his constant and
continued intercession there:

not without blood; for he went in with the blood of the bullock and the
blood of the goat; which was typical of the blood of Christ, by which he
entered in once into the holy place, into heaven, when he had obtained
eternal redemption by it, [Heb 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md)
which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people; the
bullock was offered by the high priest for himself and his family; and
the goat for the sins of the people of Israel, even all their
iniquities, transgressions, and sins, [Lev

no sin, had no need to offer for himself, only for the sins of the
people; See Gill on [Heb 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027.md).

[Hebrews 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 9:8</span></span>

The Holy Ghost this signifying,.... This shows that the Holy Ghost
existed under the Old Testament; that he is a distinct person in the
Godhead, a personal act being here ascribed to him; that he is truly and
properly God, the God whose service the priests accomplished in the
tabernacle; and by whom Moses was admonished to make all things in it
according to the pattern, and by whom the high priest was warned not to
come at all times within the vail; moreover, that the Levitical
ordinances were of God, and that they had a spiritual signification;
that the Old Testament saints were not without some knowledge of the
spiritual meaning of them; and that the Holy Ghost was the author of
that knowledge; particularly by enjoining the high priest to enter
within the vail but once a year, he gave a plain and strong intimation,

that the way into the holiest of all was not yet manifest, while as the
first tabernacle was yet standing; by which is meant, not only the first
part of the tabernacle, as in [Heb 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002.md)
but the whole of it; and not only that, but the temple built in its
room, and also the whole Levitical service is included; and the sense
is, that while the tabernacle and tabernacle worship, the temple and
temple service, were in being, "the way into the holiest of all was not
yet manifest": the Vulgate Latin and all the Oriental versions render
it, "the way of the saints"; of the priests who ministered in holy
things, and were holy to the Lord, and of all the saints that lived
before Christ; not that they did not go to heaven, but their way to it
was not so manifestly known; life and immortality were not so clearly
brought to light, as now by the Gospel; though rather it designs holy
places, even heaven itself, which was typified by the holy place within
the vail; and may be called the holiest of all, it being the residence
of the holy God, holy angels, and holy men, and is sanctified by the
presence of Christ, for his people, and where perfect holiness will be
the glory of it: the way to it is not by works of righteousness done by
men, which being imperfect cannot justify, and so not save, though this
is the way men naturally seek and take; but Christ is the only way, and
he is the plain, pleasant, and safe one: now let it be observed, that
heaven was not shut to the Old Testament saints; there was a way into it
for them, and they went the same way New Testament saints do; and that
way was in some measure known, but it was not fully manifested; it lay
hid in obscure prophecies, types, shadows, and sacrifices; hence being
more clearly revealed under the Gospel dispensation, in comparison, of
its former obscurity, and with respect to the manifestation of it, it is
called a "new way".

[Hebrews 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 9:9</span></span>

Which was a figure for the time then present,.... The tabernacle in
general was a figure of Christ's human nature, [Heb
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002.md) and the most holy part of it was a
figure of heaven itself, [Heb 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md) the
whole service of it was typical and shadowy; but it was but a temporary
figure; it was for that present time only; the things of it were suited
to that dispensation, and are now abolished, and ought not to be
revived, the ordinances of the Gospel being greatly preferable to them;
and while it did continue, it was only a parable, as the word here used
signifies; it was like a dark saying; it had much obscurity and darkness
in it; or as the Vulgate Latin version renders it, it was a "figure of
the present time"; that is, of the Gospel dispensation; it was a shadow
of good things to come under that; it prefigured what is now
accomplished; or rather it was a "figure unto, or until the present
time"; till Christ came, when all figures, types, and shadows fled away,
and were of no more real use and service:

in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices; that is, in which
tabernacle, or at which then present time, or , "according to which
figure or parable", as the Alexandrian copy and Vulgate Latin version
read, gifts and sacrifices were offered by the priests; see [Heb
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md),

that could not make him that did the service perfect; neither the priest
that offered them, nor the people whom he represented, and for whom he
did the service; they could not make real and perfect expiation for sin,
nor justify from it, nor cleanse and sanctify; the spiritual worshippers
had their sins expiated by the sacrifice of Christ; and their persons
were justified by his righteousness, and they were cleansed by his
blood: the particular instance in which, legal sacrifices did not make
perfect is, "pertaining to the conscience"; there is in every man a
conscience, and when sin is charged home upon it, that is filled with a
sense of divine wrath; nor can it be pacified with anything short of
what will answer the law and justice of God, and which is only done by
the blood and righteousness of Christ.

[Hebrews 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 9:10</span></span>

Which stood only in meats and drinks,.... That is, along with the gifts
and sacrifices offered, there only were meat offerings and drink
offerings; things which only respect the body, and cannot therefore make
perfect, as to the conscience; to which may be added, that while the
tabernacle was standing, and typical service was in being, there was a
prohibition of certain meats, as unclean, and an allowance of others, as
clean, [Lev 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#002.md) and there were
certain drinks which were unlawful to certain persons, at certain times,
as to the priests and Nazarites, [Lev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md) and which, for the above reason,
could make no man perfect:

and divers washings or "baptisms": the doctrine of which, the apostle
would not have laid again, [Heb 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002.md)
these were the washings of the priests and of the Israelites, and of
sacrifices, and of garments, and of vessels and other things; and which,
because they were performed by immersion, they are called "baptisms":
and now since these only sanctified to the purifying of the flesh, or
what was outward, they could not reach the conscience, or make perfect
with respect to that: and

carnal ordinances: which belonged to the flesh, and not the spirit or
soul, and therefore could not affect that; besides, these were only

imposed on them until the time of reformation; they were enjoined the
Jews only, though by God himself; and were put upon them as a burden, or
a yoke, and which was on some accounts intolerable, but were not to
continue any longer than the time of the Gospel, here called "the time
of reformation", or of "correction", and emendation; in which, things
that were faulty and deficient are amended and perfected, and in which
burdensome rites and ceremonies are removed, and better ordinances
introduced: or rather of direction: in which saints are directed to
Christ, the sum and substance of all types, shadows, and sacrifices, and
in whom alone perfection is.

[Hebrews 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 9:11</span></span>

But Christ being come an high priest,.... Christ is come, as appears
from the cessation of civil government among the Jews, which was not to
be till Shiloh came; from the destruction of the second temple, into
which the Messiah was to come, and did; from the expiration of Daniel's
weeks, at which he was to appear, and be cut off; from the coming of
John the Baptist, his forerunner, and from the preaching of the Gospel
to the Gentiles, and the calling and conversion of them, and the
effusion of the Spirit upon them: and he is come an high priest; he was
called to be one, and was constituted as such in the council and
covenant of peace; and he agreed to do the work of one; he was typified
by the high priest under the law; and he came as such into this world,
and has done the work of an high priest, by offering himself a sacrifice
for sin, and by his entrance into the holiest of all, with his own
blood: and he is come an high priest of good things to come; such as
peace, reconciliation, and atonement, a justifying righteousness, pardon
of sin, eternal life and salvation, which the law was a shadow and
figure of; and which under the former dispensation were to come, as to
the actual impetration of them by Christ; who is called the high priest
of them, to distinguish him from the high priests under the law, who
could not bring in these good things, nor make the comers to them and to
their offerings perfect; but Christ is the author and administrator of
them; and these things are owing to the performance of his priestly
office; and such rob Christ of his glory, as a priest, who ascribe these
good things to their own merits, or the merits of others: and the way in
which he is come is,

by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is
to say, not of this building; meaning the human body of Christ, which
was greater than tabernacle of Moses; not in bulk and quantity, but in
value, worth, and dignity; and was more perfect than that, that being
only an example, figure, shadow, and type, this being the antitype, the
sum and substance of that; and by it things and persons are brought to
perfection, which could not be, in and by that; and this is a tabernacle
which God pitched, and not man; which was reared up without the help, of
man: Christ was not begotten by man, but was conceived in the womb of a
virgin, under the power of the Holy Ghost; he came not into the world in
the way of ordinary generation, but in a supernatural manner; and so his
human body is a tabernacle, not of the common building, or creation, as
the word may be rendered, as other human bodies are.

[Hebrews 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 9:12</span></span>

Neither by the blood of goats and calves,.... With which the high priest
entered into the holy place, within the vail, on the day of atonement,
[Lev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#014.md) for Christ was not an high
priest of the order of Aaron, nor could the blood of these creatures
take away sin, nor would God accept of such sacrifices any longer:

but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place; which shows
the truth of his human nature, and the virtue of its blood, as in union
with his divine Person; by which he opened the way into the holiest of
all, as the surety of his people, and gives them boldness and liberty to
follow him there; he carried his blood not in a basin, as the high
priest carried the blood of goats and calves, but in his veins; and by
it, having been shed by him, he entered not into the holy place made
with hands, but into heaven itself; and that not every year, as the high
priest, but "once" for all, having done his work; or as follows,

having obtained eternal redemption; for us, from sin, Satan, the law,
and death, to which his people were in bondage, and which he obtained by
paying a ransom price for them; which was not corruptible things, as
silver and gold but his precious, blood: in the original text it is,
"having found eternal redemption"; there seems to be an allusion to [Job
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024.md). This was what was sought for
long ago by the, Old Testament saints, who were wishing, waiting, and
longing for this salvation; it is a thing very precious and difficult to
find; it is to be had nowhere but in Christ, and when found in him, is
matter of great joy to sensible sinners; God found it in him, and found
him to be a proper person to effect it; and Christ has found it by being
the author of it: this is called an eternal redemption, because it
extends to the saints in all ages; backwards and forwards; it includes
eternal life and happiness; and such as are sharers in it shall never
perish, but shall be saved with an everlasting salvation; it is so
called in opposition to the carnal expiations of the high priests, and
in distinction from temporal redemptions, deliverances, and salvations.
Remarkable is the paraphrase of Jonathan ben Uzziel on [Gen
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018.md).

"Jacob said, when he saw Gideon the son of Joash, and Samson the son of
Manoah, who should be redeemers; not for the redemption of Gideon am I
waiting, nor for the redemption of Samson am I looking, for their
redemption is a temporal redemption; but for thy redemption am I waiting
and looking, O Lord, because thy redemption is , "an everlasting
redemption":''

another copy reads, for the redemption of Messiah the son of David; and
to the same purpose is the Jerusalem paraphrase on the place; in
Talmudic language it would be called (x).

For if the blood of bulls and of goats,.... Shed either on the day of
atonement, or at any other time: the former of thee, Pausanias (y)
relates, was drank by certain priestesses among the Grecians, whereby
they were tried, whether they spoke truth or no if not, they were
immediately punished; and the latter, he says (z), will dissolve an
adamant stone; but neither of them can purge from sin:

and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean; the apostle refers to
the red heifer, [Num 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001.md) which being
burnt, its ashes were gathered up and put into a vessel, and water
poured upon them, which was sprinkled with a bunch of hyssop on unclean
persons; the ashes and the water mixed together made the water of
separation, or of sprinkling; for so it is called by the Septuagint,
"the water of sprinkling", and in the Targum in a following citation:
this was the purification for sin, though it only

sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; the body, or only in an
external and typical way, but did not really sanctify the heart, or
purify and cleanse the soul from sin. The Jews say, that the waters of
purification for sin were not waters of purification for sin, without
the ashes (a); and to this the Targumist, on [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md) and on [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md) refers, paraphrasing both texts
thus;

"I will forgive their sins as they are cleansed with the water of
sprinkling, and with the ashes of the heifer, which is a purification
for sin.''

How much more shall the blood of Christ,.... Which is not the blood of a
mere man, but the blood of the Son of God; and the argument is from the
lesser to the greater; that if the ashes of the burnt heifer, which was
a type of Christ in his sufferings, mixed with water, typically
sanctified to the purifying of men externally, in a ceremonial way, then
much more virtue must there be in the blood of Christ, to cleanse the
soul inwardly:

who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God;
Christ is a priest, and the sacrifice he has offend up is "himself"; not
his divine nature, but his human nature, soul and body, as in union with
his divine person; which gives his sacrifice the preference to all
others; and is the reason of its virtue and efficacy, and is expressive
of his great love to man: and this sacrifice was offered up "to God",
against whom his people had sinned, and whose justice must be satisfied,
and which is of a sweet smelling savour to him; besides, he called him
to this work, and engaged him in it, and is well pleased with this
offering, as he must needs be, since it is offered up "without spot";
which expresses the purity of Christ's nature and sacrifice, and the
perfection of it, which is such, that no fault can be found in it by the
justice of God; and hence, the saints, for whom it is offered, are
unblamable and irreprovable, There is an allusion in the clause, both to
the priests and to their sacrifices, which were neither of them to have
any spot or blemish on them; and this unblemished sacrifice was offered
unto God by Christ,

through the eternal Spirit; not the human soul of Christ; for though
that is a spirit, yet not eternal, and besides, was a part of the
sacrifice; but rather the divine nature of Christ, which is a spirit,
and may be so called in distinction from the flesh, or human nature, as
it sometimes is, and this is eternal; it was from everlasting, as well
as is to everlasting; and this supported him under all his sufferings,
and carried him through them, and put virtue unto them; and Christ was a
priest, in the divine, as well as human nature: though by it may be
better understood "the Holy Ghost"; and so the Vulgate Latin version
reads, and also several copies; since the divine nature rather acts by
the human nature, than the human nature by the divine; and Christ is
often said to do such and such things by the Holy Spirit; and as the
Holy Ghost formed and filled the human nature of Christ, so he assisted
and supported it under sufferings. This whole clause is inserted by way
of parenthesis, showing the efficacy of Christ's blood, and from whence
it is:

to purge your conscience from dead works; that is, "from the works of
sin", as the Ethiopic version renders it; which are performed by dead
men, separate and alienated from the life of God, are the cause of the
death of the soul, and expose to eternal death, and are like dead
carcasses, nauseous and infectious; and even duties themselves,
performed without faith and love, are dead works; nor can they procure
life, and being depended on, issue in death; and even the works of
believers themselves are sometimes performed in a very lifeless manner,
and are attended with sin and pollution, and need purging: the allusion
is to the pollution by the touch of dead bodies; and there may be some
respect to the sacrifices of slain beasts, after the sacrifice and death
of Christ, by believing Jews, who were sticklers for the ceremonies of
the law, and thereby contracted guilt; but immoralities are chiefly
designed, and with these the conscience of man is defiled; and nothing
short of the blood of Christ can remove the pollution of sin; as that
being shed procures atonement, and so purges away the guilt of sin, or
makes reconciliation for it, so being sprinkled on the conscience by the
Spirit of God, it speaks peace and pardon, and pacifies and purges it,
and removes every incumbrance from it: the Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate
Latin, and Syriac versions, read, "our conscience". The end and use of
such purgation is, "to serve the living God"; so called to distinguish
him from the idols of the Gentiles, and in opposition to dead works; and
because he has life in himself, essentially and independently, and is
the author and giver of life to others; and it is but the reasonable
service of his people, to present their souls and bodies as a living
sacrifice to him; and who ought to serve him in a lively manner, in
faith, and with fervency, and not with a slavish, but a godly filial
fear; and one that has his conscience purged by the blood of Christ, and
is sensibly impressed with a discovery of pardoning grace, is in the
best capacity for such service. The Alexandrian copy reads, "the living
and true God".

[Hebrews 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 9:15</span></span>

And for this cause he is the Mediator of the New Testament,.... See Gill
on [Heb 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#022.md), See Gill on [Heb
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md), See Gill on [Heb
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md). This may refer both to what goes
before, and what follows after; for Christ, that he might offer himself
to God, and by his blood purge the consciences of his people from dead
works, that so they might serve the living God, became the Mediator of
the New Testament, or covenant; and also he took upon him this character
and office,

that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that
were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the
promise of eternal inheritance; Christ became the Mediator of the New
Testament, and assumed human nature that he might die, and by dying
might obtain redemption for his people; not only for those that were
then in the world, or should be in it, but also for all those that had
been in it. "The first testament" is the first dispensation of the
covenant of grace, reaching from the first promulgation of it to Adam
after the fall, to the death of Christ; "the transgressions" that were
under it are the sins of the saints who lived under that dispensation,
froth Adam to Moses, and from Moses to Christ, and takes in all their
iniquities of every kind: and the "redemption" of these, or from these,
by Christ, at and through his death, does not suppose that there was no
remission of sins, or justification from them, under that dispensation;
or that the Old Testament saints did not go to heaven, but were detained
in a prison, till redeemed by the death of Christ; or that their sins
were only redeemed, not their persons; for transgressions may stand for
transgressors; and so the Syriac version renders it, "that by his death
he might be a redemption for them who transgressed the first testament";
so the Jews say, that the Messiah must die "to redeem the fathers" (b):
but the sense is, that though legal sacrifices could not atone for sin,
nor ceremonial ablutions cleanse from them; yet the sins of Old
Testament saints were expiated, their iniquities pardoned, and they
justified and saved, through the blood of Christ, the Lamb slain from
the foundation of the world; whose death is a redemption from
transgressions past, present, and to come; whose blood is the ransom
price for them, and was shed for the remission of them, even of sins
that are past through the forbearance of God; who took the surety's word
for the performance of all this, which in the fulness of time he
strictly fulfilled, to the satisfaction of law and justice; see [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md) and the ultimate end of Christ's
being a Mediator, and dying for such purposes, was, that called ones
might receive the promised inheritance: by the "eternal inheritance", is
meant heaven, which is by gift and bequest, belongs to children only,
and comes through the death of Christ; and is a very substantial,
plentiful, and glorious one; it is incorruptible and undefiled, and that
fades not away, and as here, "eternal"; it was prepared from the
foundation of the world, and will continue for ever; and it may be so
called, to distinguish it from the inheritance of the land of Canaan, or
any temporal one: "the promise" of this was made before the world began,
and was put into the hands of Christ, the surety of the better
testament, by whose death the heirs of it come to enjoy both the
promise, and the thing promised; and they are such who are "called", not
merely externally, but internally and effectually; by whom were meant,
not Abraham and his natural seed, nor the Old Testament saints only, but
all that are called with an holy calling, whether Jews or Gentiles, and
who will enjoy both the promise of the inheritance, and that itself, in
a way of "receiving": every word shows this affair to be all of grace;
it is an "inheritance", and therefore the Father's gift; it is by
"promise", and so of grace; and it is "received", and so freely given,
and not merited; and only such who are "called" by grace possess it; and
yet it is through the death of Christ, that so it might be received in a
way consistent with the justice of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 9:16</span></span>

For where a testament is,.... The covenant of grace, as administered
under the Gospel dispensation, is a testament or will. The Jews have
adopted the Greek word, here used, into their language, and pronounce it
and by it understand a dying man's last will and testament (d). Some of
them make it to be of Hebrew derivation; as if it was said, , "this
shall be to confirm" (e), or this shall be stable and firm; though
others own it to be the same with this Greek word (f). The covenant of
grace, is properly a covenant to Christ, and a testament or will to his
people: it is his and their Father's will, concerning giving them both
grace and glory; it consists of many gifts and legacies; in it Christ is
made heir of all things, and his people are made joint heirs with him;
they are given to him as his portion; and they have all things
pertaining to life and godliness bequeathed to them, even all spiritual
blessings; the witnesses of it are Father, Son, and Spirit; and the
seals of it are the blood of Christ, and the grace of the Spirit; and
this is registered in the Scriptures by holy men as notaries; and is
unalterable and immutable: and this being made,

there must also of necessity be the death of the testator; who is
Christ; he has various parts in this will or testament; he is the surety
and Mediator of it; and he is the executor of it; what is given in it,
is first given to him, in order to be given to others; all things are
put into his hands, and he has a power to give them to as many as the
Father has given him; and here he is called the "testator": Christ, as
God, has an equal right to dispose of the inheritance, both of grace and
glory; and as Mediator, nothing is given without his consent; and
whatever is given, is given with a view to his "death", and comes
through it, and by virtue of it: hence there is a "necessity" of that,
and that on the account of the divine perfections; particularly for the
declaration of God's righteousness, or by reason of his justice; and
also because of his purposes and decrees, which have fixed it, and of
his promises, which are yea and amen in Christ, and are ratified by his
blood, called therefore the blood of the covenant; and likewise on
account of the engagements of Christ to suffer and die; as well as for
the accomplishment of Scripture prophecies concerning it; and moreover,
on account of the blessings which were to come to the saints through it,
as a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin, peace and reconciliation,
adoption and eternal life.

For a testament is of force after men are dead,.... The necessity of
Christ's death is here urged, from the nature and force of a testament
or will, among men, which does not take place, and cannot be executed,
till a man is dead.

Otherwise it is of no strength at all whilst the testator liveth; no
claim can be made by the legatees for the part they have in it, nor can
any disposition be made by the executor of it; not that hereby is
suggested, that the testament or will of God was uncertain and
precarious till the death of Christ, and subject to change and
alteration as men's wills are till they die; nor that the inheritance
could not be enjoyed by the Old Testament saints; for it is certain, it
was entered upon by them before the death of Christ; but the sense is,
that there was a necessity of it, that the saints right unto it, upon
the foot of justice, might be evident by it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 9:19</span></span>

For when Moses had spoken every precept,.... Contained in the decalogue,
in the book of the covenant, everyone of the precepts in [Exo
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md) for this is to be understood of
the written law, and not of the oral law the Jews talk of, which they
say Moses first delivered by word of mouth to Aaron, then to his two
sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, then to the seventy elders of Israel, and
then to the whole congregation; so that Aaron heard it four times, his
sons thrice, the seventy elders twice, and all Israel once (g): but this
is the written law which he spoke audibly, and in a known language,

to all the people according to the law; which God gave him on the Mount:
this may instruct persons concerned in the public ministry, to speak out
plainly and clearly the whole counsel of God, to all to whom they are
sent, according to the word of God, which is the rule of faith and
practice:

he took the blood of calves, and of goats; in the relation of this
affair in [Exo 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md) which is referred
to, only mention is made of oxen, bullocks, or heifers, here called
calves, which were sacrificed for peace offerings, and not of goats;
though perhaps they may be intended by the burnt offerings there spoken
of, since they were sometimes used for burnt offerings, [Lev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010.md). The Syriac version only reads,
"he took the blood of an heifer"; and the Arabic version, "he took the
blood of calves"; but all the copies, and other versions, read both.
"With water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop"; neither of these are
mentioned in [Exo 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md), but since
sprinkling is there said to be used, and blood and water mixed together,
and scarlet and hyssop were used in sprinkling, as in sprinkling the
leper, and the unclean house, [Lev
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#005.md) the apostle justly concludes the
use of them here; the blood, with water, was typical of the blood and
water which sprung from the side of Christ pierced on the cross, the one
signifying justification by him, the other sanctification; the scarlet
wool, which is originally white, but becomes scarlet by being dyed, may
denote the native purity of Christ, and his bloody sufferings and death;
the hyssop may signify his humility, and the purging virtue of his
blood, and the sweet smelling savour of his person, righteousness, and
sacrifice. The apostle calls scarlet, scarlet wool; though whenever the
word is used in the Jewish laws of the Old Testament, wool is not
expressed, but it is always intended; for it is a rule with the Jews
(h), that

"the blue, which is spoken of in every place, is wool dyed of a sky
colour; purple is wool dyed red, and scarlet is wool dyed in scarlet.''

And sprinkled both the book, and all the people. In [Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md) no mention is made of the
sprinkling of the former, only of the latter, which the apostle either
concludes from the sprinkling of the blood upon the altar, upon which
the book might lie, or from tradition, or from divine revelation: some
think it does not necessarily follow from the text, that the book was
sprinkled; and repeating the word "he took", read the words, "and he
took the book and sprinkled all the people"; but this seems not natural,
but forced; and besides, all the Oriental versions are express for the
sprinkling of the book: the book of the law was sprinkled, not because
of any impurity in it, but to show the imperfection of it, and its
insufficiency to justify men; or rather the imperfection of man's
obedience to it, and to point out what the law requires in case of
disobedience, even the blood and life of men; and what it would be, was
it not sprinkled with blood, or satisfied by the blood of Christ,
namely, an accusing, cursing, and condemning law: the people, all of
them, being sprinkled with the blood, were typical of God's peculiar
people, even all the elect of God, being sprinkled with the blood of
Christ, called the blood of sprinkling, by which they are redeemed, and
which speaks peace and pardon to them. Some have thought only the
seventy elders were sprinkled, as representing the whole congregation;
and others, that the twelve pillars were only sprinkled, as representing
the twelve tribes of Israel; but Moses and the apostle agree, that they
were the people that were sprinkled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 9:20</span></span>

Saying, this is the blood of the testament,.... The first testament or
covenant; this proves what the apostle had asserted in [Heb
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018.md) that it was dedicated with blood,
or confirmed by it; compare with this [Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md)

which God hath enjoined unto you; the people of Israel, to observe, and
which they promised to do; see [Exo

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 9:21</span></span>

Moreover, he sprinkled likewise both the tabernacle,.... Not at the same
time that he sprinkled the book and the people, for then there was no
tabernacle; but afterwards, at the time that it was set up, when it was
anointed with oil, [Exo 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009.md) and
though no mention is there made of blood, yet Josephus, in agreement
with the apostle, asserts (i), that the tabernacle, and its vessels,
were not only anointed with oil, but sprinkled with the blood of bulls
and goats, as well as the garments of Aaron, and his sons: the
tabernacle was typical of the church, in which God dwells, being
purified and cleansed by the blood of Christ; and this shows, that there
is no coming into the presence of God, the place where he dwells,
without blood.

And all the vessels of the ministry; which were used in the service of
the tabernacle these may denote the vessels of grace and mercy, the
elect of God, whose hearts are sprinkled by the blood of Christ from an
evil conscience, and whose garments are washed in it, and made white by
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 9:22</span></span>

And almost all things are by the law purged with blood,.... All "except
a few things", as the Arabic version renders it; for some things were
cleansed by water, and others purged by fire, [Num
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#023.md). Some join the word almost with
the word purged, as if the sense was, that all things were purged by
blood, but not perfectly, only almost; but the former sense is best.

And without shedding of blood is no remission; that is, of sin; there
was no typical remission without it; and there can be no real remission
but by, the blood of Christ; no instance can be given of pardon without
it; if it could have been otherwise, the blood of Christ had not been
shed; for so it would seem to be shed in vain, and his satisfaction to
be unnecessary; nor is it agreeable to the justice of God to forgive sin
without satisfaction; nor is it consistent with his veracity, and
faithfulness to his word, [Gen 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017.md).
It is a common saying with the Jews, and often to be met with in their
writings, , "there is no atonement but by blood" (k); by the shedding of
blood; not by the shedding of it, as it flows out of the body of the
sacrifice, but as it is poured out on the altar; for the pouring of the
blood at the four corners, and at the bottom of the altar, were the
chief rites required in sacrifices; nor did they reckon expiation to be
expiation, unless the altar was moistened by the blood of the sacrifice
(l).

[Hebrews 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 9:23</span></span>

It was therefore necessary,.... On account of the divine appointment,
and that types and antitypes might correspond; and especially it was
necessary with respect to the Messiah, the substance and body of all
types. So Jonathan ben Uzziel paraphrases the text in [Exo
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009.md),

"and thou shalt take the anointing oil, and thou shalt anoint the
tabernacle, and all that is in it; and thou shall sanctify it, because
of the crown of the kingdom of the house of Judah, and the King Messiah,
who shall redeem Israel in the latter days.''

Upon his account it was necessary,

that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with
these; that is, that all the people, and the book of the covenant, and
the tabernacle, and its vessels, which were types and patterns of
persons and things in Gospel churches, should be purified with blood and
water, and with scarlet wool and hyssop.

But the heavenly things themselves, with better sacrifices than these;
the sum and substance of the above patterns, shadows, and examples, such
as heaven itself; which though not impure in itself, yet some think it,
may be said to be purified, because saints are made meet for it, by
being purged with the blood of Christ; others observe, that sin reaches
to heaven, and provokes God that dwells there; hence atonement for it
may be called a purification of heaven: but rather this may be said of
it, inasmuch as by the blood of Christ an entrance and preparation is
made for the saints into it. Likewise, the human nature of Christ is
among these heavenly things; not that it is heavenly, as to the matter
and substance of it, but may be so called, because of its wonderful
formation; and which has been purified, not from any real internal
pollution that was in it, but from what was imputed to it, the sin of
his people. Also the whole church, triumphant and militant, may be
intended by heavenly things: the Old Testament saints went to heaven
before Christ came; and though they were not impure, but were the
spirits of just men made perfect, yet their iniquities were purged by
the blood and sacrifice of Christ, after they were gone to heaven; see
[Heb 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md). The church militant, or
believers on earth, may be said to be heavenly, since they are partakers
of an heavenly birth and calling; their head is in heaven, and their
conversation is there; and they have a right unto it, and are making
meet for it; and they are in themselves defiled with sin, and are
purified by the blood of Christ, and sanctified by the offering up of
his body once for all: to which may be added, that spiritual blessings
are heavenly things; they are from heaven, and saints are blessed with
them in heavenly places and these come to them through the blood and
sacrifice of Christ; yea, the Gospel, which is from heaven, and the
doctrines of it, are sealed and confirmed by the blood of Christ: his
sacrifice is expressed in the plural number; not that there has been a
repetition of it, for it is but one sacrifice, and but once offered up,
and will never be reiterated; but to show the excellency of it, being
usual with the Jews to use the plural number of things the most
excellent; so Christ is called "Wisdoms", [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md) besides, respect may be had to
the many sacrifices under the law, which were types of it, and were
answered and fulfilled by it; and to the many persons on whose account
it was offered; and to the parts of it, the soul and body of Christ: and
this is a better sacrifice than the legal ones, in its own nature and in
its use and efficacy to take away sin, and make perfect, which they
could not.

[Hebrews 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 9:24</span></span>

For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,.... The
most holy place in the tabernacle of Moses, or in the temple built by
Solomon, and rebuilt by Zerubbabel, and repaired by Herod,

which are the figures of the true; that is, the most holy place in the
tabernacle and temple, was a figure of the truth of that type; see [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009) as follows. Josephus (m.md) suggests
the same, when speaking of the most holy place; he says, that it was
inaccessible to the priests, that it might be as heaven to God.

But into heaven itself; not the visible heavens, the airy and starry
ones, through which he passed, but the third heaven, the habitation of
God, angels, and glorified saints: this shows that heaven is a place;
that Christ, as man, was out of it when on earth; and that at his
ascension he entered into it, having done the work he came about, and
that with acceptance: the end of his entrance was

now to appear in the presence of God for us; Christ, as God, was always
in his presence, from everlasting; as Mediator, he was with him in the
council of peace; while he was here on earth his Father was with him, he
was not alone; but now in his human nature he is at his right hand,
where he appears before him, as a favourite before his Prince, on the
behalf of another, or as an advocate on the behalf of his client: Christ
appears in the court of heaven for his elect, by representing their
persons; by presenting himself, his blood, sacrifice, and righteousness,
before God on their account; by introducing them into the presence of
God, and offering up their prayers with the incense of his mediation; by
presenting them to himself, and to his Father, and obtaining every
blessing for them. And this he does "now", since his entrance; not that
he did not appear before God for the saints of the Old Testament, for he
was the angel of God's presence then, though he did not appear then in
the manner he does now, as the Lamb in the midst of the throne, as if it
had been slain; but it denotes the continuance and perpetuity of his
appearance for his people; he is ever interceding for them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 9:25</span></span>

Nor yet that he should offer himself often,.... Or at all again; which
shows the perfection of his sacrifice, for justice was satisfied, the
law fulfilled, sin done away, and complete salvation obtained at once;
which lies against the errors of the Socinians, who say he offers
himself now in heaven; and of the Papists, who pretend to offer the body
of Christ daily in their mass:

as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of
others; not his own, nor other men's, but the blood of goats and calves;
but Christ entered into heaven with his own blood, he having been altar,
priest, and sacrifice: the high priest went into the most holy place
every year, but Christ has entered into heaven once for all, where he
sits down and continues, having done his work effectually.

[Hebrews 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 9:26</span></span>

For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the
world,.... For if it was necessary that he should often offer up himself
now, which is the same as to suffer, since the sacrifice of himself, the
same was necessary before; seeing sin was in the world from the
beginning, and the saints from the foundation of the world had their
sins expiated by the sacrifice of Christ; but the truth is, Christ's
sufferings were but once, though the virtue of them is always, both
before and after; nor can he suffer more, or again, because of his power
over death and the grave, and because he has effectually obtained what
he suffered for:

but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by
the sacrifice of himself; this is to be understood, not of his
appearance in heaven, of which mention is made in [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md) but of his incarnation on earth,
called an appearance; not as though his human nature was a mere phantom
or apparition, for it was a real thing; or as if he was then manifested
to be what he really was before; for before his incarnation he was not
truly and actually man; but this is said with respect to the
manifestation of his invisible deity; or of him as the Son of God in
human nature; and in regard to the types of the old law, under which he
was hid; and with respect to the prophecies of his coming; and it
designs the same thing with his descent from heaven, and coming into
this world, in which he appeared in fashion as a man, as a mean man, as
an afflicted one; yea, he looked like a sinful man, bearing the
infirmities and sins of his people; his appearance was but to a very
few, and for a little time; and the time of it was, "in the end of the
world"; the same with the last days; the last age of the world; the end
of the Jewish economy; at the close of their civil and ecclesiastical
state, according to [Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md) & so the
Jews expect their Messiah , "at the end of days" (n): and this
appearance was but "once"; there were many appearances of him in an
human form, under the Old Testament dispensation; and there were many
after his resurrection; but this is said to be but once, in opposition
to the many types and sacrifices under the law, and agrees with his one
oblation, and once suffering: the end of his appearance was, to put away
sin; the filth of it, by his blood; the guilt of it, by his atoning
sacrifice; and the punishment of it, by his sufferings and death, the
penalty of the law; and in consequence of all this, the dominion of it
by the power of his grace, and the very being of it hereafter: and this
putting it away is signified by his bearing, carrying, and taking it
away; by removing it as far as the east is from the west; by finishing
and making an end of it; by crucifying the old man, destroying the body
of sin, and by an utter disannulling and abolishing it, as a debt, and
as a law; and all this is done by the sacrifice of himself; by the
offering up of his body and soul an offering for sin; as in [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 9:27</span></span>

And as it is appointed unto men once to die,.... Not a moral, or what is
commonly called a spiritual death, nor an eternal one, but a corporeal
one; which does not arise from the constitution of nature, but from the
sin of man, and God's decree on account of it; by which it is fixed that
men shall die, and how long they shall live, and when they shall die; so
that they cannot die sooner nor later; all things antecedent to death,
which lead on to it, and issue in it, are appointed by God, and so is
death itself, with all its circumstances; men's days can neither be
lengthened nor shortened, either by Christ himself, or others: and this
statute and appointment of God concerns men, not angels, and reaches to
all men, wicked and righteous; and though there have been some
exceptions, as Enoch and Elijah; and all will not sleep, or die, some
will be found alive at Christ's appearing; yet such will undergo a
change which is equivalent to death, as Enoch and Elijah have done: and
generally speaking men die but once; it is not usual for men to die, and
live again, and then die again; there have been some extraordinary
instances of this kind, but they are rare; it is the statute law of
heaven in common for men to die and that but once; so Cicero (o) the
Heathen says, "omnibus definitam esse mortem": Christ died once, he will
die no more; and it is the comfort of the saints, that though they die
the first death, they shall not be hurt of the second death; and the
consideration of this decree should excite to diligence and industry:
death is certain to God, but uncertain to us, as to the time, nor should
we curiously inquire into it, but patiently wait for it, and quietly
submit unto it:

but after this the judgment; the last and general judgment, which will
reach to all men, quick and dead, righteous and wicked, and in which
Christ will be Judge. There is a particular judgment which is
immediately after death; by virtue of which, the souls of men are
condemned to their proper state of happiness or woe; and there is an
universal judgment, which will be after the resurrection of the dead,
and is called eternal judgment, and to come; this is appointed by God,
though the time when is unknown to men; yet nothing is more certain, and
it will be a righteous one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 9:28</span></span>

So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many,.... As man dies but
once, Christ was offered but once, or he suffered and died but once; and
that was not on his own account, or for his own sins, "but to bear the
sins of many": not of angels but of men, and these not a few, but
"many"; which is said to magnify the grace of God, to exalt the
satisfaction and righteousness of Christ, and to encourage souls to hope
in him: hence many are brought to believe in him, and many are justified
by him, have their sins forgiven them, and are glorified; though Christ
bore not the sins of all men; for as all men have not faith, all are not
justified, pardoned, and saved: what he bore were "sins"; all kind of
sin, every act of sin, and all that belongs to it; its filth, guilt, and
punishment, even the iniquity of all his people; which must be a
prodigious weight, and than which nothing could be more nauseous: his
bearing them supposes they were upon him, though not in him, imputed,
though not inherent; that he did not sink under them; that he made an
entire satisfaction for them, and bore them wholly away, both from the
persons of his people, and from the sight of justice. The way in which
he came to bear them was this; he became a surety for all the elect; his
Father imputed to him all their sins, and he voluntarily took them upon
himself; where justice found them, and demanded satisfaction of him for
them, and he gave it; which is an instance both of his great love, and
of his great strength:

and unto them that look for him: with affection, faith and patience:

shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation; this is to
be understood of Christ's visible and personal appearance on earth,
which will be a glorious one; he will appear in his own glory, and in
his Father's glory, and in the glory of the holy angels, and in the
glory of his power, to the joy of saints, and to the terror of the
wicked; for every eye shall see him: and this is said to be "the second
time"; that is, that he appears on earth, and personally; for though he
often appears to his people, it is in a spiritual way; and though he
appeared to Stephen and to Paul, yet not on earth, but in heaven; and
this is called the second time, with reference to his first appearance
in human nature at his incarnation, and after that he ascended to
heaven; and as this will be the second, it will be the last: the manner
in which he will appear, will be, "without sin"; without sin itself;
without any thing like it: without any infirmities, which though not
sinful are the effects of sin; without sin imputed to him, with which he
appeared before; without being a sacrifice for sin; and without sin upon
his people that come with him, or he shall meet whom he shall raise, or
change, and take to himself: and the end of his appearance with respect
to them, will be "unto salvation"; the end of his first appearance was
to obtain salvation for his people, and he has obtained it, and there is
a comfortable application of it made unto them by the Spirit of God; but
the full possession of it will be hereafter, and into this will Christ
put them, when he shall appear: the Alexandrian copy adds, "by faith",
and also some other copies.
